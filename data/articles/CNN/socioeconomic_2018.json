            "article_content": "Campaign signs sprout from the ground here at Northwest Regional Library, an early voting site in Coral Springs, Florida. Standing in front of the polls, two candidates on the ballot are having a conversation. \u201cThe tragedy happened six months ago,\u201d the candidate for the District 4 seat on the Broward County School Board, Lori Alhadeff, says. \u201cSchool started, and we need to make those changes now. We can\u2019t make another mistake.\u201d \u201cIf we get on the board together, we\u2019ll both bring that energy that will impact all the schools around the county,\u201d the candidate for the District 8 seat, Ryan Petty, replies. \u201cWe\u2019ll get this. We\u2019ll get the change made.\u201d The November midterms will determine whether Democrats or Republicans are destined to control Congress for the next two years, and most of the nation\u2019s attention has been focused on the House and Senate seats that are up for grabs. But the school board race in Broward County, Florida, is a reminder that local politics are often just as passionate \u2013 and just as controversial. The mass shooting that left 17 dead at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School on February 14, 2018, has thrust the issues of school safety, mental health and gun violence into the forefront of the race. Petty, Donna Korn and Elijah Manley are running in the nonpartisan yet politically charged race for the District 8 at-large seat on the board. All three have faced criticism for some of their comments or actions. Alhadeff, who lost her daughter Alyssa in the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School, is running for the open District 4 seat. For all four candidates, the race is personal. The primary election takes place on August 28. If one candidate gets more than 50% of the vote, he or she wins the seat. If not, the two candidates with the most votes will face a run-off election on November 6. Korn, a single mother of three and a former teacher, has held the countywide seat for seven years. Republican Gov. Rick Scott appointed her to the position, but she switched from the GOP to no affiliation this year. Korn has received big endorsements from the Broward Democratic Party and the local newspaper, the Sun Sentinel. The incumbent candidate faced criticism from families of the Parkland victims after her comments during a district-wide meeting on August 9. In the meeting, Korn said that the district was coming off of an \u201camazing school year,\u201d according to a tweet by the district\u2019s director of school safety and security, April Schentrup, who also lost her child in the Parkland shooting. In a statement following the meeting, Korn said her words were \u201cpoorly chosen.\u201d She said she intended to acknowledge the district\u2019s achievements \u201cand not disregard the pain and loss\u201d from the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School on February 14. They hope you remember what they'll never forget Stand With Parkland, a group made up of the shooting victims\u2019 family members, has called for the entire school board to be replaced. \u201cI can only imagine that if I lost a child, I would be looking for someone to be responsible for that,\u201d Korn told CNN. \u201cNikolas Cruz is responsible, but I think sometimes we just feel like we need to keep reaching beyond, and I understand where they\u2019re coming from. But as a board member, I couldn\u2019t feel any more deeply for those families.\u201d The school board was recently criticized after canceling a pilot program to test out metal detectors at Stoneman Douglas right before the school year began. Korn says the board made the decision after school safety consulting firm Safe Havens International brought up potential risks associated with the plan. Parkland students return to school \u201cWe don\u2019t want to jump so fast that we\u2019re doing something that isn\u2019t having the impact that we need it to have,\u201d Korn told CNN. \u201cIt has to actually have an impact on making our schools more safe, and not just feel like they are, they actually have to be.\u201d Korn says the board has agreed on the necessity of a crisis line for students to call in emergencies, approved funding for upgraded security cameras, and are asking taxpayers to vote for half a million dollars in additional resources that will go toward a goal of having one school resource officer, or armed guardian, for every thousand students. She says that they aim to have single point of entry in place at all schools in the county in 2019. But some say the board\u2019s actions aren\u2019t enough. Neither Petty nor Manley has held a political office \u2013 Petty is a telecom executive, and Manley, a sophomore student at Broward College \u2013 but what they do possess is frustration with how the board has handled concerns from parents and students. Petty\u2019s 14-year-old daughter, Alaina, was one of 17 people killed in the shooting at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School. \u201cShe was an angel. She was our baby girl, and we miss her a lot,\u201d Petty told CNN. \u201cLike most parents that have experienced this kind of tragedy, you want to try to explain it. You want to try to understand it. You want to try to understand how something like this could happen.\u201d After the shooting, the Florida Legislature established the Marjory Stoneman Douglas Public Safety Commission, a committee tasked with investigating the attack. Gov. Scott appointed Petty to serve on the committee alongside public officials and law enforcement officers. Petty \u2013 who is a Republican and supporter of 2nd Amendment rights \u2013 has been endorsed by the Broward Republican Executive Committee. Despite his party affiliation and the endorsement, he says school safety shouldn\u2019t be about political labels. \u201cThe gun debate comes to the foreground immediately, and it\u2019s a divisive issue,\u201d Petty explained. \u201cIronically, by focusing on school safety, we\u2019ve actually gotten more gun control legislation passed in Florida than any group that\u2019s just been solely advocating for gun control. That\u2019s the irony of this.\u201d Petty, as well as Manley and Korn, have come out against arming teachers, although a bill signed by Scott after the shooting would allow some teachers and staff to carry guns in school. Petty\u2019s campaign took a hit about a month before the polls opened. In late July, the Sun Sentinel reported that Petty had posted tweets, mostly from 2008 to 2013, that contained controversial remarks about guns, gays, minorities, unions, Jews, Muslims, liberals and public education. When asked about the tweets, Petty told CNN that he never intended to have a political career, and the comments were taken out of context. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to pull words out, look at them in isolation and ascribe whatever meaning you want to them,\u201d Petty said. \u201cClearly, that\u2019s not what I stand for.\u201d Manley, a recent graduate from Fort Lauderdale High School, has attended Broward County School Board meetings since he was in 8th grade. At 19, he is the youngest and most progressive candidate running for the District 8 seat. He says he was motivated to run because the current board lacks a student voice. \u201cI want to provide younger people with the chance to have our ideas heard and respected,\u201d Manley told CNN. In addition to improving school security, he says the board should also address socioeconomic issues. \u201cOur school board needs to work with other government officials and other government entities in Broward County to work hard to ensure that poverty is not an issue for our students,\u201d he said. Manley began his campaign before the shooting at Stoneman Douglas and says the incident changed the way he views politics in Broward County and his role as a candidate. \u201cIt has never been like this before,\u201d Manley said. \u201cNow we see that younger people\u2019s voice is being actually considered as part of the political process. I think that\u2019s going to be a big part of the upcoming midterm elections, and I think it\u2019s going to be a big part of the 2020 presidential elections as well.\u201d On August 24, four days before the primary election, the Sun Sentinel reported that Manley spent thousands of campaign dollars on restaurants and Uber rides as well as a $2,000 consulting fee to a person with a false identity. When asked about the article and if he worried that it would hurt his credibility as a candidate, Manley told CNN, \u201cAs a first-time candidate, I made a mistake in reporting information. That is common for first-time campaigners.\u201d All three candidates bring diverse experiences and perspectives to the table, but they share a common goal: making schools safer for students. They each agree school shootings are preventable. There were 22 school shootings ... all before June \u201cThe students are a vital source of information,\u201d Petty said. \u201cWe say \u2018if you see something, say something,\u2019 but as adults and as a school district, we have to do something. When they see something and say something to us, we have to act.\u201d \u201cHow do we see what\u2019s happened and make sure it doesn\u2019t happen again?\u201d Korn said. \u201cThat\u2019s our job. Our job isn\u2019t to say, what could have happened, it\u2019s what happened and how do we move forward? How do we do good by every single one of our kids?\u201d \u201cWe have absolutely no more time to wait,\u201d Manley said. \u201cWe\u2019ve waited long enough, and now we\u2019re dealing with a crisis in our county. This is our lives, this is our education, this is our future, and we deserve to make the decisions on how our future should move forward.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Oligarch. It sounds nefarious, to be sure. The Trump administration announced new sanctions against seven Russian oligarchs with ties to President Vladimir Putin and 12 companies they own or control on Friday. CNN reported Wednesday that special counsel Robert Mueller, who is charged with investigating Russian election meddling, had questioned three Russian oligarchs, all of whom were unnamed in the report. What\u2019s Mueller looking at? From the CNN report: One area under scrutiny, sources say, is investments Russians made in companies or think tanks that have political action committees that donated to the campaign. Another theory Mueller\u2019s office is pursuing, sources said, is whether wealthy Russians used straw donors \u2013 Americans with citizenship \u2013 as a vessel through which they could pump money into the campaign and inauguration fund. Exclusive: Mueller's team questioning Russian oligarchs The Trump administration in January named 96 oligarchs to a naughty list of sorts. There are no specific repercussions for the oligarchs other than putting them on notice. Many of these men are usually in the news for buying things in the West \u2013 sports teams and real estate. In fact, as CNN reported at the time, \u201cthe oligarchs\u2019 names matched exactly a list of 96 Russian billionaires compiled by Forbes magazine last year.\u201d In short, Americans are being introduced to this small universe of Russian oligarchs but a lot of people probably don\u2019t understand what exactly an oligarch is. The Kremlin, for its part, says there are no more oligarchs. \u201cThe phrase \u2018Russian oligarchs\u2019 is considered inappropriate,\u201d Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters recently. \u201cThe time when there were oligarchs in Russia passed long ago, there are no oligarchs in Russia.\u201d To clear all of this up, we went in search of an oligarch expert and found Thomas Graham. According to his bio, Graham is co-director of the Russian studies program at Yale, a managing director at Kissinger Associates Inc. \u2013 where he focuses on Russian and Eurasian affairs \u2013 and was special assistant to the president and senior director for Russia on the National Security Council staff during the administration of George W. Bush. We first asked what, to him, is the definition of \u201coligarch.\u201d \u201cOligarchs are rich Russian businessmen who are close to the seat of power in Russia,\u201d he said, adding that \u201calmost any rich Russian businessman is an oligarch, because in Russia there is a close relationship between private wealth and public power.\u201d He said the way most rich Russians get rich is by having connections in government and working them. But it wasn\u2019t always this way. We are on generation two, at least, of Russian oligarchs. \u201cThe term was first used in the mid-\u201990s after the breakup of the Soviet Union,\u201d Graham said. \u201cA time of great socioeconomic stress and a time when the instruments of state power were breaking down. It was also a period when you were going through the great process of privatization.\u201d Out of this ooze of change from communism to semi-capitalism rose the oligarchs, a small number of individuals who used their political power to gain control over private assets. We\u2019re talking about the Russian oil and gas industry, the timber and aluminum industries and industries around other natural resources. Mueller's team questioning Russian oligarchs In that period, Graham said, oligarchs were arranged into smaller groups. \u201cA typical oligarchic group would have some person in a high state position,\u201d he said. \u201cIt would have media resources. And it would have security resources.\u201d Some of the more notable early oligarchs were people like former former media mogul Vladimir Gusinsky and Mikhail Khodorkovsky, who was at that time one of Russia\u2019s richest men because he headed the oil company Yukos. In that in-between period, the oligarchs got rich and powerful, but Graham said their relationship with the government began to change when President Vladimir Putin came to power. There\u2019s a new crowd of oligarchs who are perhaps smaller in scale than the original bunch but no less dependent on government relationships for their wealth. They don\u2019t have the same kind of power over the state, however, because of the power Putin has. \u201cNow, you can\u2019t be a billionaire and not be an oligarch because you have to have some relationship with those who are in political power to maintain control of your assets,\u201d said Graham. What\u2019s the difference between a Russian oligarch and an American billionaire? There are plenty of billionaires in the US who wield incredible political power. Michael Bloomberg, anyone? Donald Trump? And even those not directly in politics can have political power. The Koch brothers leap to mind. But it\u2019s not the same as in Russia, said Graham. Trump administration expected to sanction several Russian oligarchs \u201cThe difference in our country is we have institutions,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have independent court systems. You can try to influence policy, but you don\u2019t have to have access to the political power to protect your property.\u201d \u201cYou can be a rich businessman in the US and not worry about your contacts in government. It\u2019s a little bit different in Russia; each business decision you make, you have to be checking with your contacts in the Kremlin. The government can strip you of your oligarch status.\u201d This is what happened to many in that early generation of oligarchs. Khodorkovsky \u2013 who challenged Putin \u2013 had much of his wealth stripped, spent more than 10 years in jail on tax charges and has since fled the country. Gusinsky fell afoul of the Kremlin and left Russia amid intense political pressure. Being an oligarch can still be perilous, though. Ask Ziyavudin Magomedov, an oligarch recently arrested on corruption charges. \u201cYou can lose your property overnight if you run afoul of the government,\u201d said Graham. And that\u2019s why you hear a lot about Russian oligarchs buying things in the West. The Brooklyn Nets in the US. Soccer teams, real estate and other expensive things. Oligarchs like to buy outside of Russia. Some of this is a conscious decision by these oligarchs to move some of their assets offshore to places where the assets are protected by the rule of law, said Graham: \u201cThat\u2019s why you buy in Miami and London and Western Europe.\u201d He added that the bulk of most oligarchs\u2019 assets, however, will remain in Russia, so they\u2019re still at the mercy of the government. He said it\u2019s not beyond reason that they\u2019d be asked by the Kremlin to do things in the US related to elections, but whether an oligarch is operating on his or her own behalf or Russia\u2019s could be anyone\u2019s guess. Trump administration finally announces Russia sanctions over election meddling \u201cI think it\u2019s also true that in many cases, because their fortunes depend on maintaining good relations with those in power,\u201d they are \u201casked by the government to do certain favors,\u201d Graham said. \u201cThe problem you have is that a businessman in Russia has to operate in a different way than a businessman in the US because you don\u2019t have a reliable legal system,\u201d he said. \u201cYour ability to maintain your hold on property is reliant on your ability to maintain relations with the government.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Idaho Gov. Butch Otter, a Republican, endorsed a grass-roots effort to expand Medicaid in his state on Tuesday. The initiative, which will appear on the November 6 ballot, would extend Medicaid to 62,000 adults in poverty and bring $400 million in federal match funding to the state. Another 29,000 residents just above the poverty line would also be made eligible for Medicaid if the measure passes. \u201cI strongly support expanding healthcare to folks who need it,\u201d Otter said in a news release from Idahoans for Healthcare, which is spearheading the effort. \u201cIt\u2019s good sense and it\u2019s the right thing to do.\u201d Otter had backed previous proposals to expand Medicaid, but they ultimately died in the state Legislature. The governor, who is not running for re-election, also appeared in an ad endorsing the measure, saying, \u201cProposition 2 is an Idaho-grown solution.\u201d The spot also features his wife, Lori, saying that expansion would help rural hospitals, boost the economy and create jobs. Idaho is one of four states that will have Medicaid initiatives on their ballots next week. Voters in Utah and Nebraska will decide whether to accept the Affordable Care Act\u2019s provision to expand Medicaid, while those who live in Montana will vote on whether to maintain the expansion beyond July 2019. Idaho\u2019s Lt. Gov. Brad Little, who is running on the Republican ticket to succeed Otter, said he \u201cwill adhere to the will of the people on this issue.\u201d His Democratic opponent, former lawmaker Paulette Jordan, has endorsed the initiative. The campaign in Idaho began when two high school friends and one\u2019s wife toured the state last summer in a bright green 1977 Dodge camper \u2013 with \u201cMedicaid for Idaho\u201d emblazoned on the side. They were trying to raise support for expanding Medicaid by talking about those who earn too much to qualify for the safety net program but can\u2019t afford coverage on the Obamacare insurance exchanges. The ballot measures in the four states come a year after Maine\u2019s residents gave the thumbs-up to expansion by 59% to 41% in a first-of-its-kind referendum. However, it has yet to go into effect there as Republican Gov. Paul LePage continues to resist implementing it. Voters will decide whether to expand Medicaid in these red states Some 31 states plus the District of Columbia have already expanded Medicaid, which broadens coverage to Americans with incomes up to 138% of the poverty level, or about $17,000 for an individual and $35,000 for a family of four. Virginia will join the club in 2019, after lawmakers there approved the expansion earlier this year.",

            "article_content": "Christiane Amanpour\u2019s full interview with Nancy Pelosi airs on CNN International at 7 p.m. CET and 10 p.m. ET, and on PBS across the United States at 10 p.m. ET. Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, who served as the first woman Speaker of the US House of Representatives, told CNN that while \u201cit\u2019s time for new blood\u201d in her party, she also thinks it\u2019s a gamble in the current political climate for her not to be at the negotiating table. \u201cIf Hillary Clinton had won, and the Affordable Care Act was protected \u2013 I feel very proprietary about that \u2013 I was happy to go my way,\u201d Pelosi told CNN\u2019s Christiane Amanpour on Friday in an interview for her new hour-long program, which premieres on CNN International and PBS on Monday. Pelosi added that it\u2019s \u201cup to the caucus\u201d to determine who leads her party, \u201cbut to have no woman at the table and to have the Affordable Care Act at risk, I said \u2018As long as (Trump\u2019s) here, I\u2019m here.\u2019\u201d Pelosi also said that if this fall\u2019s midterms were held immediately that her party would take back control of the chamber and that \u201cwomen would lead the way.\u201d \u201cIf the election were held today, we would win overwhelmingly and women would lead the way,\u201d she said. \u201cWe have so many excellent women candidates from women across the country. Women marched and then they ran, and now they\u2019re running and now they\u2019re going to be members of Congress.\u201d Pelosi, who is poised to possibly resume her former title if Democrats win this fall, also told CNN it was \u201clong overdue\u201d that she finally graced the cover of TIME last week, the first time she\u2019s ever had top billing on a national news magazine. She said that the magazine \u201cdidn\u2019t understand the stark significance\u201d of a woman becoming second-in-line to the presidency when she was elected Speaker in 2006. \u201cI don\u2019t think too much about it, but I do think that other women did,\u201d she said about not making the cover last decade. \u201cIt\u2019s long overdue. I thought maybe when we passed the Affordable Care Act, expanding health care to so many millions more people and the rest, that that might get their attention, but it didn\u2019t.\u201d She continued, \u201cBut anyway, it\u2019s here now and that\u2019s nice, but I think a lot of women are thinking, \u2018Why now? Why did it take so long?\u2019 You\u2019d have to ask them.\u201d With Democrats currently leading generic polls to win control of the House in November, Pelosi is on the brink of potentially becoming speaker again. It\u2019s no guarantee, however. Dozens of Democratic candidates, due to her polarizing popularity, have campaigned on not supporting Pelosi for the speakership. And in 2016, Ohio Democratic Rep. Tim Ryan challenged Pelosi for minority leader, winning nearly a third of the caucus\u2019 support. Pelosi has a legislative agenda if Democrats take back the House \u2013 lower health care costs, increase wages, tighten gun laws \u2013 but the party also plans to target what they call a \u201cculture of corruption\u201d in Washington, using oversight power to hold hearings and issue subpoenas. With so many controversies that have outraged Democrats under the Trump administration, the list is long for issues that Democrats want to target when it comes to oversight. Pelosi warned that Democrats must be strategic in their investigations. \u201cIt has to be prioritized and not scatter shot. \u2026 It\u2019s all about seeking truth,\u201d she said. \u201cWhere that takes us with the President and his performance remains to be seen.\u201d A small number of Democrats in Congress are already clamoring for impeachment of the US President, but Pelosi is trying to keep that temptation among her party under control, saying the i-word is not a priority. \u201cOur priority (is) unifying. Impeachment is a very divisive approach. Elections should determine who is in office,\u201d she said. \u201cIf the President has broken law, he\u2019s not above the law, but that remains to be seen.\u201d As for her own political future, the California Democrat, who\u2019s raised hundreds of millions of dollars for her party, said she feels \u201cvery comfortable\u201d about her support for the speakership. \u201cI think it\u2019s really important for women to see, because you can\u2019t run away from a fight in the arena \u2026 when the Republicans have such a poverty of ideas that the only thing they can put in their ads is that I\u2019m a San Francisco liberal who supports LGBTQ rights, I can take the heat,\u201d she said, adding later, \u201cI want women to know that this isn\u2019t easy, power is never given away and it always has to be fought for.\u201d Pelosi said she was encouraged, however, by the droves of women running for office this year, calling it a \u201cvery transformative time.\u201d \u201cNothing is more wholesome for America, for our system of government and politics than the increased participation of women in our leadership and their participation in our government,\u201d she said. \u201cI honestly believe if we decrease the role of money in politics and increase the level of civility in politics, we\u2019ll even have many more women who will go forward, enter the arena, win the fight (and) make a difference.\u201d Correction: This story has been updated to correct the Speaker of the House's place in the presidential line of succession.",

            "article_content": "Watch the two candidates tee off their general election campaigns on CNN\u2019s \u201cErin Burnett OutFront\u201d at 7 p.m. ET Wednesday. Arizona now has a historic all-female Senate race \u2013 and it is already getting nasty. Images of a pink tutu against a US Air Force flight suit are one candidate\u2019s opening salvo in what could be one of the most expensive and highest-profile races this November. Either Democratic Rep. Kyrsten Sinema or Republican Rep. Martha McSally will become the first female US senator from Arizona in what could be a critical result for which party controls the Senate. Early signs are that the all-woman race will be anything but dainty. McSally started the fight early, even before she won Tuesday\u2019s primary against right-wing challengers, with her first ad against Sinema, who also won her party nomination this week. America\u2019s first woman to fly in combat for the Air Force, McSally deployed to the Middle East after the 9/11 attacks. The ad shows side-by-side pictures \u2013 McSally in her flight suit underneath a fighter jet versus Sinema in a pink tutu, protesting the Iraq War with bongo drums and a protester in a tie-dye T-shirt behind her. The images could not be more different. \u201cShe\u2019s in a pink tutu. I\u2019m in my uniform,\u201d McSally said in an interview with CNN, explaining why she chose to open her general election campaign with this ad. Wearing a gold necklace with a fighter jet emblem, McSally underscored her groundbreaking role as a woman in the military and her lawsuit against the Pentagon that eliminated the regulation for military women to cover their heads and arms while in Saudi Arabia. \u201cI served in the military 26 years and put my life on the line for our freedoms. I\u2019ve fought for women\u2019s rights. She\u2019s out there protesting in a pink tutu, while we were in harm\u2019s way.\u201d McSally\u2019s hard-charging fighter pilot personality is reflected in her personal fitness, too. The 52-year-old has competed in triathlons and is often on the jogging trail before her campaign team has even woken up and cracked open their phones. And in this, her opponent may match her stride for stride. Sinema, 42, was the first serving member of Congress to compete in an Ironman triathlon. She cheekily tweeted a link this week about extreme athleticism as the new midlife crisis. If McSally\u2019s barrier-breaking military service resonates powerfully in the state, so does Sinema\u2019s cinematic story of a childhood in extreme poverty. Sinema was born in to a middle-class Tucson family, whose financial woes escalated during the 1980s. Her parents divorced, and her mother remarried and moved Sinema and two siblings to Florida with their new stepfather. The financial troubles would deteriorate further in Florida, Sinema recalled. \u201cBeing homeless for three years is not easy,\u201d she said, reflecting on how her family moved into an abandoned gas station. \u201cLiving without running water, without electricity, sometimes being hungry, it teaches you to value every opportunity that comes your way.\u201d The poverty gave Sinema her own youthful purpose to push hard. She graduated from Brigham Young University early and returned to Phoenix to do social work in low-income communities. She then earned master\u2019s, law and doctorate degrees from Arizona State University and became a criminal defense attorney before running for the state Legislature with the Green Party. She came out publicly as a bisexual and led a campaign to defeat a same-sex marriage ban. Sinema joined the Democratic Party and ran for the US House, winning as the only openly bisexual member in Congress. But if her background on paper sounds like that of a forceful liberal, Sinema paints herself in ads and in person as an upbeat, unifying moderate. Sinema points out her congressional voting record of about 60% in line with President Donald Trump, touting a moderate record with an ever-diversifying Arizona. Shifting demographics in the state have pushed the politics more purple and Trump won Arizona in 2016 by less than 4 percentage points. \u201cI\u2019m not an ideological person,\u201d said Sinema, cheerful as she spoke with CNN in an interview. \u201cI\u2019m very practical, common sense. Very focused on getting the job done. I think that\u2019s spoken to a lot people in Arizona who are the same way. We share those same values.\u201d Democratic operatives in Arizona say McSally\u2019s ad certainly stings, but Sinema\u2019s campaign plans to forge ahead by taking the high road. She easily won her primary, and Democratic state sources say her general election plan will be to point out McSally\u2019s embrace of Trump and her shift to the right in the GOP primary. At a polling place on primary day, Sinema greeted voters, reacting with disciplined calm when asked repeatedly about the attacks from McSally. \u201cOur campaign is 100% focused on the work that we\u2019re doing to listen to Arizonans and respond to their everyday concerns,\u201d she told CNN. \u201cAs I travel the state, I hear from everyday Arizonans what they care most about. And they don\u2019t really care about whether someone has an R or a D at the end of their name. What they care about is who\u2019s going to roll up their sleeves and just solve their problems.\u201d Still, McSally\u2019s video challenge to Sinema is an eye-catching gambit. \u201cThat ad \u2013 wow,\u201d remarked Kelly Dittmar, a Rutgers University assistant professor with the Center for American Women and Politics. The center has been tracking the record-breaking number of women running for office this year but notably watching Arizona with its high-profile race between McSally and Sinema. \u201cMcSally\u2019s ad reinforces what have typically been credentials for candidacy most associated with men,\u201d Dittmar said. \u201cImportantly, she doesn\u2019t downplay the fact that she is a woman but does contrast with Sinema the type of woman she is, contrasting the performance of gender between the two women. One (is) more associated with stereotypically masculine roles and strengths, and the other associated with traditional conceptions of femininity and, more specifically, weakness and/or a lack of seriousness to deal with the serious national security issues she raises in the ad.\u201d In a year where women have prized their authenticity, from their gender and race, professions to even personal tattoos, Arizona\u2019s single gender US Senate race promises to alter the national narrative on gender in politics. \u201cWomen candidates who offer different types of experience, perspectives and images of leadership will help to expand all of our notions of who can and should serve in government,\u201d Dittmar said. \u201cAn all-female race makes it even harder for voters and observers to ignore this diversity among women.\u201d More ads will certainly roll out in the coming weeks as money floods into a race that national Republicans see as critical to maintaining their control of the Senate and that national Democrats see as a potential gain. Republicans left behind in blue Democratic wave of new women candidates DefendArizona, a political action committee formed by some of the state\u2019s most powerful business leaders, has already reserved nearly $5 million in TV airspace this fall, said spokesman Barrett Marson. \u201cAnd that\u2019s an initial reserve,\u201d added Marson, saying the PAC had already spent more than $3 million to prop up McSally. Sinema has plenty in the bank to counter McSally\u2019s attacks. Between January and August, her campaign had raised more than $10 million, with $2.4 million cash on hand. McSally also raised $7.7 million, with $1.9 million on hand in the same period. Woman-to-woman matchups for Congress remain rare, where women currently hold about 20% of the 535 seats. Republican Sen. Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia is one of those who faced another woman in her Senate run in 2014. Democrat Natalie Tennant opened her campaign for Senate with an attack ad against Capito, then a member of the House. The ad accused the lawmaker of being part of an obstructionist and gridlocked Congress, prompting Capito to call the opening ad \u201cvindictive.\u201d The seven-term congresswoman would eventually defeat Tennant soundly, making history in West Virginia as that state\u2019s first woman in the Senate. She was also the first Republican senator elected by West Virginia in almost 60 years. \u201cYes, of course, there is a difference between running against a man and running against a woman,\u201d Capito told CNN. \u201cBut I think it has more to do with the different perspectives we have when it comes to the issues.\u201d Capito welcomes matchups such as the McSally-Sinema race, looking forward to the day when it\u2019s no longer notable that so many women are candidates. \u201cIt\u2019s a positive change in the makeup of our political landscape. I was the first woman elected to the Senate from the state of West Virginia,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m incredibly proud of that, and I want that accomplishment to be inspiration and motivation for other young women in West Virginia \u2013 as well as women across the country. We need even more women running for office \u2013 at all levels.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Virginia lawmakers crossed an important hurdle Wednesday, ensuring that, despite years of resistance, the state will become the latest to expand access to Medicaid. The move to broaden the federal health care program for low-income Americans comes as a direct result of the political fallout from last November\u2019s election. Democrats came within one seat of drawing even in the state\u2019s House of Delegates in last fall\u2019s election. It was a stunning turn of events after decades of rule by Republicans. The GOP stranglehold on the House was the primary barrier to adopting the Medicaid expansion provision of the Affordable Care Act. Former Gov. Terry McAuliffe, a Democrat, spent all four years in office attempting to expand the program, to no avail. In the 2018 legislative session, the first with the new House of Delegates, Republicans quickly worked with Democrats to negotiate a budget deal that included expansion. However, the leadership of the GOP-controlled state Senate (which was not up for re-election in 2017) remained resistant to the concept and used a variety of legislative tactics to stall the budget process. Ultimately, a small cadre of pro-expansion Republicans teamed up with Senate Democrats to bring budget amendments directly to the floor that included expansion and had enough support to pass. The bill passed 22-18, with the support of three Republicans. The final budget bill will still need to pass the House in its current form and be signed into law by pro-expansion Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam, but that is expected without complications. Virginia\u2019s Medicaid expansion would be Democrats\u2019 first major policy victory to come as a result of the party\u2019s strength in elections that have taken place since Trump took office. Democrats have largely been playing defense, using victories in congressional and state legislative special elections to make passing legislation a little tougher for Republicans. But in Virginia, Democrats have gone on offense. \u201cToday\u2019s vote in Virginia is a smack in the face to the Trump administration and the Republicans in Congress who keep pushing an out-of-touch, anti-health-care agenda,\u201d said Leslie Dach, chair of the advocacy group Protect Our Care, which supports the Affordable Care Act. \u201cWhile they keep voting for health care repeal and sabotaging the system, Virginia voters demanded \u2013 and won \u2013 expanded coverage.\u201d Medicaid expansion in Virginia, however, will come with strings. The deal calls for the state to apply for a federal waiver to allow it to implement work requirements, copayments and other measures. It also would place new taxes on certain private hospitals to cover state costs. Work requirements and other policies could cause tens of thousands of residents to lose access to Medicaid coverage, according to the left-leaning Center on Budget and Policy Priorities. The Trump administration took the historic step earlier this year of allowing states to require certain Medicaid recipients to work for their benefits. More than a dozen states have expressed interest, and the administration has already approved four states\u2019 waiver applications. Many of these states are targeting the expansion population \u2013 often able-bodied, working age adults without dependent children \u2013 in their work-requirement waivers. CNN Money: Trump administration allows states to make Medicaid recipients work The move to expand Medicaid means Virginia will receive an additional $2 billion a year in federal funding. The federal government picks up at least 90% of the tab in states that have expanded, though opponents worry that Washington could one day pull back on its support. Proponents, on the other hand, have noted that Virginia has already missed out on more than $10 billion since the provision first went into effect in 2014. On Medicaid expansion: We\u2019ve been fighting about this for five years, talking about the importance of expanding coverage to up to 400,000 Virginians. #AskThe Expansion is expected to add about 400,000 Virginians to the Medicaid rolls, according to state data. The uninsured rate would fall to 10.9% in 2019, down from 14.9%, an Urban Institute analysis found. Virginia has among the most stringent eligibility rules in the country. Childless, non-disabled adults can\u2019t sign up currently, while parents can qualify only if their income is below $6,900 for a family of three. Health care activists file lawsuit over Maine Medicaid expansion Monthly enrollment averaged 1 million people, including 732,000 low-income families and children, in fiscal year 2017. Virginia will join 31 other states and the District of Columbia in providing health insurance to its residents who earn up to 138% of the poverty level, or roughly $16,800 for an individual or $28,700 for a family of three this year. 32 states now have elected to expand health coverage and none of them have reversed. It\u2019s good for other states and it will be good for the Commonwealth as well. #AskThe Momentum is building in other states, as well. Voters in Maine approved a ballot initiative to expand Medicaid last year, though Republican Gov. Paul LePage has refused to implement it. Health care activists are suing the state in hopes of moving the process forward. At least 70,000 residents would gain coverage. Advocates in Utah have collected enough signatures to put Medicaid expansion on the ballot this fall. Meanwhile, Utah Gov. Gary Herbert and state lawmakers are waiting for federal approval for a partial expansion, which would add adults making up to 100% of the poverty line, or about $12,100 per person. Idaho activists are also gathering signatures to allow residents to vote on Medicaid expansion in November. CNN\u2019s Eric Bradner contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Romney gave the keynote address at the Salt Lake City Chamber of Commerce summit On Friday, he will participate in a \"fireside chat\" at the Silicon Slopes conference Speeches could offer a window into his policy priorities Mitt Romney refused to say anything about his plans to run for the US Senate during an appearance before the Salt Lake City Chamber of Commerce on Tuesday, but he offered hints about what his agenda might be in Washington. In a speech centered on economic policy, Romney outlined his concerns about the failure to address entitlement reform to curb the nation\u2019s debt, global warming, education and inter-generational poverty. Using charts and graphs, he focused at length on the declining opportunities and lack of wage growth for less educated workers \u2013 the voters who powered President Donald Trump\u2019s bid for the White House. \u201cThose who have less than high school or high school only have seen a deteriorating economic circumstance \u2013 that leads to greater and greater income disparity, wealth disparity within the population, a lot of resentment, anger and finger-pointing,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s just not fair. Not good. Everyone in America has an equal value under the eyes of our creator.\u201d \u201cSome of these issues we have answers to,\u201d Romney said, criticizing gridlock in Washington, \u201cbut just not the will to get them done.\u201d During a Q&A session following his speech, Romney was asked whether he plans to run for the seat of retiring Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah. \u201cI have nothing for you on that topic,\u201d he replied with a smile. He was also asked what his focus would be in Washington: \u201cI\u2019m not going to answer that either.\u201d Romney, who has bluntly criticized Trump\u2019s impolitic rhetoric and unpresidential behavior at various points over the last two years, did not mention the President. He praised aspects of the tax reform bill and the administration\u2019s effort to reduce regulations. When asked about his own vision for the country, he touched on Trump\u2019s campaign theme \u2013 \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d \u2013 and said that in his view to be \u201cgreat\u201d America must show both its strength and goodness. He cited the strong moral values of the leaders and voters of Utah as an example to the nation. \u201cThere\u2019s another component of greatness that we cannot afford to lose, and that\u2019s goodness. I don\u2019t think a nation can be considered a great nation that\u2019s not good,\u201d Romney said to applause, using Russia under Vladimir Putin as an example of a nation lacking that quality. \u201cThe character, the culture of America is what has made us the powerhouse of the world economically, with our strength as well as our goodness.\u201d Romney, who worked at the Boston-based Bain & Company before forming Bain Capital, has long kept a vacation home in Utah and he made the state his primary residence in 2014. He is best known in Utah for salvaging the 2002 Salt Lake City Olympic Games after they were mired in a bribery scandal that became a deep embarrassment to the state. Though Romney has quietly been telling friends for weeks that he plans to run, the official line from his advisers is that he is still exploring the opportunity, talking to friends and family, as well as fellow Utahns about what they would like to see from their next senator. The inevitability of Mitt Romney\u2019s next campaign Attention has centered on his fraught relationship with Trump. He sharply criticized Trump\u2019s rhetoric during the 2016 campaign, as well as his missteps once he moved into the White House. Trump had actively encouraged Hatch to seek an eighth term, but he and Romney are on cordial terms. It is unclear whether Trump encouraged Romney to run in their most recent telephone conversation earlier this month. Romney advisers have refused to comment on what was said during the call. As the country was celebrating the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday Monday, Romney rebuked the President for questioning why the US should allow immigrants from \u201cshithole\u201d countries to enter the US. \u201cThe poverty of an aspiring immigrant\u2019s nation of origin is as irrelevant as their race. The sentiment attributed to POTUS is inconsistent w/ America\u2019s history and antithetical to American values. May our memory of Dr. King buoy our hope for unity, greatness, & \u2018charity for all,\u2019\u201d Romney tweeted early Monday. Because of his immense popularity in Utah, Romney is expected to have a fairly easy path to the Senate. No Republicans of stature in Utah have stepped forward to say they plan to run for Hatch\u2019s seat. Early last year, Hatch made it clear that he would like to see Romney replace him. Romney\u2019s biggest hurdle would be winning over the most ardent conservative activists at the Utah GOP convention later this year when they decide who to nominate for the Senate. But even if he were to fail to win the 40% needed to advance to the ballot through that process, he could easily secure a spot on the primary ballot by collecting signatures and submitting them to the state. In the November general election, he is most likely to face Democrat Jenny Wilson, a member of the Salt Lake County Commission whose father was a well-known mayor of Salt Lake City. Given Utah\u2019s long Republican tradition, she would face very long odds in a quest to defeat Romney.",

            "article_content": "When Donald Trump lashed out at people coming to the US from \u201cshithole countries,\u201d it was a reaction to a plan  to cut the number of people entering the country through the visa lottery program. According to CNN sources, at a closed-door meeting in the Oval Office, lawmakers brought a proposal to reduce the number by half, with the rest going to underrepresented countries in Africa and nations with Temporary Protected Status (TPS). Trump appears to have glossed over the fundamental humanitarian purpose of TPS, which is granted to individuals from countries where conditions such as war, natural disasters or political strife prevent citizens from returning safely. While under TPS designation, nationals cannot be removed from the US and can work and travel in the country. However, it does not lead to lawful permanent resident status and people under TPS can be removed if the designation is lifted. Jonathan Katz, author of \u201cThe Big Truck That Went By\u201d on the failure of disaster relief efforts in Haiti, said Trump\u2019s remarks and those who have defended them ignore both the histories of these countries and US involvement in them. \u201cYou\u2019d have to know nothing about WHY Haiti is poor (or El Salvador in kind), and WHY the United States (and Norway) are wealthy,\u201d Katz said in a widely-shared Twitter thread. \u201cBut far worse than that, you\u2019d have to not even be interested in asking the question.\u201d GDP: $8.02 billion (2016) Population: 10.8 million (2016) Amount receiving in US aid: $251 million (2017) Number of people with TPS: About 58,700 TPS designation: January 2010 (ends July 2019) Haiti has been under TPS since a devastating 7.0-magnitude earthquake struck the island nation in January 2010, killing up to 300,000 people and displacing more than a million. Relief efforts in the wake of that disaster, led by US organizations, were highly criticized and often ineffective. Though plans to remove the country from TPS were announced last year, as of September 2017, almost 40,000 people remained displaced, living in temporary shelters and camps on the outskirts of the capital, Port-au-Prince. According to the World Bank, Haiti is the poorest country in the Americas, with almost 60% of the country living under the national poverty line of $2.41 per day. The US has a long history of military and political intervention in Haiti. GDP: $26.8 billion Population: 6.3 million Amount receiving in US aid: $105 million Number of people with TPS: About 263,000 TPS designation: March 2001 (ends September 2019) El Salvador was granted TPS in 2001 following a massive 7.7-magnitude earthquake, the worst to hit the country in a decade, killing hundreds of people and damaging more than 220,000 houses. After nearly 17 years, the \u201coriginal conditions caused by the 2001 earthquakes no longer exist,\u201d the US Department of Homeland Services said this week, announcing that TPS would be removed by September 2019. It added that the US government has repatriated more than 39,000 Salvadorans in the last two years, \u201cdemonstrating that the temporary inability of El Salvador to adequately return their nationals after the earthquake has been addressed.\u201d The US backed El Salvador\u2019s right-wing government in a 12-year civil war against leftist guerillas which left 75,000 people dead between 1979 and 1992. GDP: $21.5 billion Population: 9.1 million Amount receiving in US aid: $150 million Number of people with TPS: About 86,200 TPS designation: January 1999 Hurricane Mitch, a Category 5 storm, devastated Honduras in October 1998, killing about 11,000 people across Central America. In addition to the ongoing affects of that storm and others since \u2013 most recently Hurricane Nate \u2013 Honduras also \u201cfaces the highest level of economic inequality in Latin America\u201d as well as \u201crampant crime and violence,\u201d according to the World Bank. The homicide rate in Honduras is among the worst in the world, at 59 murders per 100,000 inhabitants in 2016. The country also faces an unstable political environment: the US endorsed a coup in 2009 which ousted the nation\u2019s democratically elected President, and last year Washington recognized the re-election of President Juan Orlando Hernandez despite electoral irregularities and mass protests. GDP: $21.1 billion Population: 29 million Amount receiving in US aid: $138 million Number of people with TPS: About 13,000 TPS designation: June 2015 Nepal\u2019s designation also stems from an earthquake, a 7.8-magnitude tremor which struck near the country\u2019s capital, Kathmandu, in early 2015, killing more than 8,000 people and damaging millions of homes. Around 3% of the country was pushed into poverty as a direct result of the earthquake, the World Bank said, with total reconstruction costs as high as $6.7 billion. While conditions in the country have improved, as of 2016, there was still a \u201csubstantial, but temporary, disruption of living conditions,\u201d according to DHS. However, that assessment came before major flooding late last year affecting more than a third of the country, which the World Bank said \u201ccaused severe disruption and damage, especially in the southern plains\u201d and predicted would hamper economic growth. GDP: $13.2 billion Population: 6.1 million Amount receiving in US aid: $26 million Number of people with TPS: About 5,300 TPS designation: January 1999 (ends January 2019) Designated for the same reason as Honduras, Nicaragua has also suffered greatly from natural disasters in recent years. However, a DHS report in November found \u201cit is no longer the case that Nicaragua is unable, temporarily, to handle adequately the return of nationals of Nicaragua.\u201d \u201cNicaragua has stood out for maintaining growth levels above the average for Latin America and the Caribbean,\u201d according to the World Bank, though it warned poverty and inequality levels remain high. During the Reagan administration, the US funneled money and arms to right-wing rebel groups known as the Contras, which fought a brutal civil war against the Nicaraguan government until 1990. In 1986, the International Court of Justice ruled the US had violated international law. GDP: $6.2 billion Population: 14.3 million Amount receiving in US aid: $416 million Number of people with TPS: About 500 TPS designation: September 1991 Somalia was designated for TPS after the country descended into civil war after dictator Siad Barre\u2019s ouster in 1991. Nearing three decades of conflict, much of the country\u2019s governance structure, economic infrastructure, and institutions have been destroyed. \u201cThe security situation in Somalia remains fragile and volatile,\u201d according to DHS. The agency said Somalis couldn\u2019t safely return to the country: \u201cSomalia continues to experience a complex protracted emergency that is one of the worst humanitarian crises in the world.\u201d The US is heavily involved militarily in Somalia, conducting more than 30 air strikes in the country in 2017 against militant groups al Shabaab and ISIS which killed up to 230 people, according to the Bureau of Investigative Journalism. GDP: $9.01 billion (2015) Population: 12.2 million Amount receiving in US aid: $813 million Number of people with TPS: About 50 TPS designation: November 2011 South Sudan gained its independence in 2011, after a vote was promised in a 2005 peace deal which aimed to put a halt to decades of violence in the country. However, tensions between north and south remained long past the vote, and in 2013 South Sudan was plunged into civil war, leaving hundreds dead and displacing more than a million people. Last year, as a result of the conflict, many parts of the country were suffering from famine, as a huge UN operation attempted to keep the peace. \u201cThe renewed conflict in South Sudan is undermining development gains achieved since independence and worsened the humanitarian situation,\u201d according to the World Bank. \u201cWithout conflict resolution and a framework for peace and security, the country\u2019s longer-term development and prosperity are threatened.\u201d GDP: $95.5 billion Population: 39.5 million Amount receiving in US aid: $151 million Number of people with TPS: About 1,000 TPS designation: November 1997 (ends November 2018) Sudan was designated for TPS based on the \u201congoing armed conflict and extraordinary and temporary conditions.\u201d Sudan has been beset by conflicts, most notably the Darfur conflict, which began around 2003 when several rebel groups took up arms against the government in Khartoum. The situation in Sudan has improved in recent years, but concerns persist about its stability and human rights. However, in September, DHS said nationals of Sudan could now return \u201cwithout posing a serious threat to their personal safety.\u201d GDP: \u2014 Population: 18.4 million Amount receiving in US aid: $729 million Number of people with TPS: About 6,200 TPS designation: March 2012 Syria has been designated for TPS since 2012, almost a year after civil war broke out in the country in the wake of the Arab Spring. An estimated 400,000 Syrians have been killed in the conflict, according to the UN, with millions more displaced. \u201cViolent conflict and the deteriorating humanitarian crisis continue to pose significant risk throughout Syria,\u201d DHS said in 2016. The US has intervened heavily in the war since its earliest days, providing funding for anti-government rebels and groups fighting ISIS and other Islamist militant organizations. US Special Operations Forces, Marines and Army Rangers are on the ground in Syria, and US planes have conducted more than 8,700 airstrikes in the country since 2014, according to monitoring group AirWars. GDP: $27.3 billion Population: 27.5 million Amount receiving in US aid: $573 million Number of people with TPS: About 800 TPS designation: September 2015 Yemen received TPS designation in September 2015 following the outbreak of civil war when Houthi rebels drove out the US-backed (non-democratically elected) President Abdu Rabu Mansour Hadi. Since then, the crisis has escalated into a multi-sided war leaving at least 10,000 dead, according to the United Nations, with millions more displaced and at risk of famine and cholera. Both the US and its major ally in the region, Saudi Arabia, have been heavily involved in the war, conducting air strikes and providing assistance to anti-Houthi forces. In December, the UN\u2019s Humanitarian Coordinator for Yemen, Jamie McGoldrick said he was \u201cdeeply disturbed\u201d by mounting civilian casualties in Yemen and denounced the \u201ccomplete disregard for human life that all parties, including the Saudi-led Coalition, continue to show in this absurd war.\u201d CNN\u2019s Madison Park, Eli Watkins and Abby Phillip contributed reporting.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: The authors are co-chairs of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. Their 2018 annual letter, from which some points in this article are adapted, is available at www.gatesletter.com. The opinions expressed in this commentary are theirs. \u201cIs it fair that you have so much influence?\u201d We\u2019ve been asked that question more than a few times in the 18 years since we started our foundation. Our answer? No. It\u2019s not fair that we have so much wealth when billions of others have so little. And it\u2019s not fair that our wealth opens doors that are closed to most people. However, we do this work, and use whatever influence we have, to help as many people as possible and to advance equity around the world. And we are committed to being open about what we fund and what the results have been. (It\u2019s not always clear what\u2019s been successful and what hasn\u2019t, but our foundation team works hard to assess our impact, course correct and share lessons.) Although we\u2019ve had some success in getting the world to pay more attention to health and extreme poverty, it would be hard to argue at this point that we made the world focus too much on them. Having influence does make it harder to get honest feedback, though. In business, your customers will tell you in an instant when you\u2019ve made a mistake. It\u2019s not the same in philanthropy. Some of our critics don\u2019t speak up because they don\u2019t want to risk losing their funding from us. That\u2019s why hearing and answering tough questions is important. And it means we need to hire well, consult experts, learn constantly and seek out different viewpoints. Even though our foundation is the biggest in the world, businesses and governments spend much more than we do. California, for example, spends more than our entire endowment just to run its public school system for one year. And we use our resources in a very specific way: to test out promising innovations, collect and analyze the data and let businesses and governments scale up and sustain what works. We want to incubate lots of different ideas, and then help the best ones get out there as quickly as possible. There\u2019s a natural follow-up to the question about influence: \u201cIf it\u2019s unfair that you have so much wealth, why don\u2019t you give it all to the government?\u201d The answer is that we think there\u2019s always going to be a unique role for foundations. They\u2019re able to take a global view to find the greatest needs, take a long-term approach to solving tough problems and manage high-risk projects that governments can\u2019t take on and corporations won\u2019t. If a government tries an idea that fails, someone wasn\u2019t doing their job \u2013 and might lose his or her job in the next election cycle. Whereas if we don\u2019t try some ideas that fail, we\u2019re not doing our jobs. Here\u2019s another question we get a lot: \u201cWhy are you really giving your money away \u2013 what\u2019s in it for you?\u201d It\u2019s not because we think about how we\u2019ll be remembered. We would be delighted if someday diseases like polio and malaria have been forgotten, and the fact that we worked on them has been, too. Looking forward with Bill Gates We do this work because it\u2019s important, it\u2019s rewarding and it\u2019s in line with how we were raised. We both come from families that believe in leaving the world better than you found it. Melinda\u2019s parents made sure their children took the social justice teachings of the Catholic Church to heart. When Melinda was in high school \u2013 at Ursuline Academy of Dallas \u2013 she volunteered in the public schools, tutoring students who were falling behind in math.  Bill\u2019s parents advocated for a dizzying number of important causes and local organizations in Seattle, everything from United Way and the University of Washington to school levy campaigns. Of course, these values are not unique to the two of us. Millions of people give back by volunteering their time and donating money to help others. We are, however, in the more unusual position of having a lot of money to donate. Our goal is to do what our parents taught us and do our part to improve the state of the world. The two of us have been doing this work, more or less full time, for close to two decades. That\u2019s the majority of our marriage. It\u2019s almost the entirety of our children\u2019s lives. By now the foundation\u2019s work has become inseparable from who we are. We do the work because it\u2019s our life.  We\u2019ve tried to pass on values to our children by talking with them about the foundation\u2019s work, and, as they\u2019ve gotten older, taking them with us on trips so they can see it for themselves. We\u2019ve spent thousands of hours learning together, meeting with scientists, educators and world leaders. Where we go, who we spend our time with, what we read and watch and listen to \u2013 these decisions are made through the prism of our work at the foundation (when we\u2019re not watching \u201cThe Crown\u201d or \u201cThe Man in the High Castle.\u201d). Maybe 20 years ago we could have made a different choice about what to do with our wealth. But now it\u2019s impossible to imagine.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Van Jones is a CNN political commentator. He is the co-founder of #cut50, a national, bipartisan criminal justice organization fighting to safely and smartly reduce the prison population while keeping communities safe. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his. Conventional wisdom told us that we should have lost all hope for any federal criminal justice reform after President Donald Trump was elected. His law and order rhetoric as a candidate and his nomination, as President, of Jeff Sessions to be Attorney General were alarming. However, as of Thursday, Jared Kushner, the President\u2019s son-in-law and adviser, may have resurrected the possibility of some grudging forward motion, even in the Trump era. Sessions just made the opioid war harder to win Prior to Trump\u2019s nomination as the Republican Party\u2019s candidate for the presidency, both political parties had been moving in a positive direction on fixing our broken criminal justice system. In 2015, I co-hosted a Bipartisan Summit on Criminal Justice Reform with Newt Gingrich, Pat Nolan and Donna Brazile. Speakers ranging from then-Attorney General Eric Holder to conservative Georgia Governor Nathan Deal all agreed that the system was unnecessarily funneling people struggling with addiction, mental illness and poverty into our prisons and jails. And over the past several years, a few brave Republican governors and party leaders led the charge in making a three-pronged conservative argument against a criminal justice system that encroaches on individual liberties, wastes financial resources and infringes on Christian values of redemption and mercy. The Bipartisan Summit and several other bipartisan efforts spurred intense debate on Capitol Hill \u2013 nearly resulting in an overhaul of the federal justice system during the last Congressional session. Jeff Sessions' conservative agenda And while a comprehensive criminal justice overhaul fell short, progress was made through the 21st Century CURES Act in a lame-duck compromise. That bill bundled $1 billion in spending to fight the opioid epidemic with $2 billion in funding for Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s cancer research \u201cmoonshot\u201d and alternatives to incarceration for people suffering from mental illness and substance abuse. It also established training programs for law enforcement officers and prison guards in identifying and effectively responding to individuals with mental illness. But the election of Trump seemed to have killed all hope of progress \u2013 and introduced the specter of a rapid rollback to the worst days of the ill-considered drug war. Within the first months of Trump\u2019s presidency, his administration reversed much of the progress made during President Barack Obama\u2019s tenure. Doubling down on the use of private prisons, rolling back consent decrees and oversight of some of America\u2019s most troubled police departments, and promising to seek the harshest punishments even in the case of low-level drug crimes. Meek Mill case shows vengeful aspect of justice system And Sessions recently rescinded an Obama-era memo to judges discouraging them from incarcerating people for not being able to pay fines and fees, and announced he would give US attorneys discretion on prosecuting marijuana cases in states where the drug had been legalized. Because of these actions, the federal prison population is predicted to increase this year, after a period of steep decline under the Obama administration. Unfortunately, we know communities of color will be disproportionately harmed. And yet, Kushner brought conservatives to the White House on Thursday to make the case to Trump himself. Kushner\u2019s commitment to this issue seems personal. Having watched his father, Charles Kushner, sentenced to prison, he is likely to have an intimate understanding of how brutal and dehumanizing the criminal justice system can be. Kushner\u2019s Office of American Innovation is tasked with bringing \u201cnew thinking and real change\u201d to some of America\u2019s most pressing challenges. There is no shortage of innovative ideas when it comes to fixing our criminal justice system. There are plenty of reasons to be skeptical of these efforts. The Trump administration zig-zags famously and seems to be at war with itself on this issue. But there\u2019s also some room for hope. Evidence-based policies to reduce prison time while boosting public safety have been championed by leading conservative think tanks like the American Enterprise Institute and the Heritage Foundation. Jeff Sessions' marijuana move will backfire The question is how far Kushner can or will go. Some issues like mental health care, prison conditions and re-entry won\u2019t run afoul of Sessions\u2019 hard line. But real sentencing reform might create a showdown inside the administration and within the Republican caucus during what\u2019s shaping up to be a heated midterm election year. Reformers on both sides have some reason to be optimistic. The present disaster that is America\u2019s criminal justice system offends the highest values and deepest values of both political parties. Our criminal justice system has grown so out of control that an estimated 70 million Americans have a criminal record \u2013 meaning virtually every American has a friend, neighbor or loved one who\u2019s been impacted. And according to a poll by the Charles Koch Institute, even 54% of Trump voters know someone who is or has been incarcerated. One area that is bringing all sides together is a campaign led by #cut50 to provide better treatment of women behind bars, thereby reducing the harmful consequences of incarceration on women, children and families.  Another area where there is agreement is better support and economic opportunity for individuals returning to their communities after incarceration. Both parties agree that public safety is best served when people leaving prison have meaningful opportunities to obtain housing, employment and education. An administration that on the one hand wants to roll back progress on medical marijuana can\u2019t be fully trusted to handle the issue of justice reform optimally. But the American people are tired of the Washington, DC food fight and are looking for leadership. And for the millions of people behind bars and their families, any light in the darkness should be encouraged.",

            "article_content": "Claudia Bivins wanted her grandson to understand the sacrifices African-Americans made to get the right to vote. So when she left home Tuesday to vote in Mississippi\u2019s Senate runoff, she wore a Confederate flag draped around her shoulders and a red noose hanging from her neck. The unconventional lesson left some people scratching their heads, but those who know Bivins said it made sense. Carlos Wilson had an inkling of what she was up to when he saw her outside his polling station in Hattiesburg. The two know each other from their shared interests in political activism and social justice, said Wilson, a pastor at Ebenezer Missionary Baptist Church. \u201cClaudia is very outspoken, a very conscious woman \u2026 If there\u2019s something that\u2019s got to be said \u2013 that needs to be said \u2013 and if she\u2019s around, she\u2019s one of those people who will say it,\u201d he said. \u201cI immediately knew what was going on, but I always like to hear her story so I asked what the deal was today.\u201d Bivins told CNN that her trip to the polls was a field trip with her 7-year-old grandson, who had completed a homework assignment the day before about why voting is important. She brought the noose, she said, to symbolize the past lynching of her ancestors. The flag was to represent the heavy burden of racism that still exists on her shoulders today, she said. \u201cIt still weighs me down,\u201d Bivins said. \u201cThe flag represents racism, slavery and affliction.\u201d Bivins was part of the first integrated class in her high school, she said. One of the lessons she shared with her grandson Tuesday was that she wouldn\u2019t have been allowed in the school he now attends when she was his age, she said. After voting, Bivins took her grandson to a place she frequents: the grave of Vernon Dahmer, a civil rights activist killed by the Ku Klux Klan for organizing voter registration for African Americans. In years\u2019 past, Bivins said, she would often visit Dahmer\u2019s grave on election days. This year, she and her grandson laid the Confederate flag over his grave and placed olive branches and peppermint on it. She said the olive branches symbolizes the champion that Dahmer was and the peppermint represents healing. \u201cAs I laid the rebel flag down across Vernon\u2019s grave, I told my grandson what it represents \u2013 our hope that racism and hatred would die,\u201d Bivins said. \u201cThat it would be killed at the root of our hearts, minds and souls.\u201d Bivins said her demonstration was inspired by this week\u2019s runoff election, one that brought Mississippi\u2019s history of racism and lynching into focus. On the ballot was Senator Cindy Hyde-Smith, who told one supporter that she\u2019d be \u201con the front row,\u201d if he \u201cinvited me to a public hanging.\u201d Her campaign team called the comment an \u201cexaggerated expression of regard,\u201d but the comment still cost her backing from big name donors like Walmart and Google. CNN also reported that Hyde-Smith once promoted a measure that praised a Confederate soldier\u2019s effort to \u201cdefend his homeland\u201d and had pushed a revisionist view of the Civil War. CNN projected on Tuesday night that Hyde-Smith defeated her opponent, Mike Espy, in the runoff election. Bivins told CNN she disagreed with President Donald Trump\u2019s decision to campaign for Hyde-Smith. But Tuesday\u2019s field trip was about connecting the past with the present, she said, by introducing him to a martyr who died fighting for their right to vote. \u201cIt was about teaching my grandson a part of history that is normally hidden or ignored,\u201d she said. Some people may think Bivins\u2019 demonstration was in \u201cpoor taste,\u201d Wilson said. \u201cBut if you know Claudia and if you know the message she was trying to send, those of us who know her are very proud of her.\u201d Among those who initially found Bivins\u2019 actions off-putting were members of Dahmer\u2019s family. Vernon Dahmer was a co-founder of the Hattiesburg chapter of the NAACP. In 1964, he came together with the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) to organize a voter registration movement. His mantra was \u201cif you don\u2019t vote, you don\u2019t count.\u201d The movement was met with threats of violence, and \u2013 for their work to register African-Americans to vote \u2013 the Dahmer family was met with threats of death. After two years of working toward voter registration, Dahmer announced that he would help pay the poll taxes of those who could not afford it. The next day, the Ku Klux Klan firebombed Dahmer\u2019s farm, killing him. Dennis Dahmer was driving down the highway when his older brother, Vernon Jr., contacted him and told him about a woman who laid a Confederate flag on their father\u2019s grave. \u201cInitially we really didn\u2019t know what was going on. You see something like that especially in a place like Mississippi with the history it has, you don\u2019t know what to think, but it\u2019s usually not good.\u201d Nooses found at Mississippi state Capitol one day before the special election The Dahmer brothers had reason to have misgivings. The Mississippi Department of Public Safety is looking for suspects accused of placing a pair of nooses and signs with messages like \u201cwe\u2019re hanging nooses to remind people that times haven\u2019t changed\u201d on Mississippi Capitol grounds on Monday. But then, Dennis Dahmer learned that Bivins was an African-American activist, and that she intended to remove the flag later in the day. Even after learning that Bivins intended to honor his father, Dennis Dahmer was concerned about her method. He worried that, like him, others would not know what message to take away. He also discouraged using graves for any kind of activism for the sake of the loved ones of those buried. \u201cIt brings back all kind of bad memories that we never forget. It brings you back,\u201d Dahmer said. Still, Dahmer said he commends Bivins for her activism. \u201cWe just need more people to be vocal, to be visual about how they feel about what\u2019s going in America right now,\u201d Dahmer said. \u201cNow is the time to send that message loudly that \u2018Hey, this stuff that\u2019s going on is not the best of America.\u2019\u201d Correction: An earlier version of this story said that Bivins told Dahmer she'd remove the flag; she said that to the custodian, not Dahmer. The story has been corrected to reflect that.",

            "article_content": "This was the school year teachers reached their breaking point. From West Virginia to Arizona, they walked out en masse to protest at their state capitols. Many were tired of working multiple jobs and wanted higher salaries. Even more demanded better school funding for their students to replace crumbling textbooks and archaic supplies. Sometimes they got what they wanted. Other times, they didn\u2019t. Here\u2019s a look at which battles teachers won and lost \u2013 and why this all went down now. What teachers wanted: West Virginia teachers \u2013 with an average salary of $45,642 \u2013 demanded better pay and a fix to the Public Employees Insurance Agency. Here's how far teacher salaries have fallen behind The night before the strike began, Republican Gov. Jim Justice signed off on a 2% teacher raise this year and 1% raises for each of the next two years \u2013 still not enough to keep up with inflation. So the first statewide teacher strike of the year ensued. What they got: After nine days of the strike, Justice agreed to a 5% raise for teachers. As part of the negotiations, legislators also agreed to give all state employees a raise. The governor also issued an executive order aimed at creating a long-term revenue fix to public employees\u2019 insurance program. What\u2019s going to happen next: While the strike ended amicably \u2013 with both teachers and lawmakers celebrating \u2013 some teachers and students will now have to prolong the school year into June to make up for days lost to the strike. What teachers wanted: Like West Virginia, teachers in Oklahoma rank in the bottom three states for teachers salaries. Veteran teachers had often worked about 10 years before cracking the $40,000 mark. Tulsa teachers walk 110 miles to confront lawmakers The Oklahoma teachers\u2019 union wanted $10,000 raises for teachers; $5,000 raises for support staff, such as janitors and cafeteria workers; and $200 million in education funding. What they got: Shortly before teachers walked out, Gov. Mary Fallin approved an average raise of $6,100 for teachers; $1,250 for support staff; and a $50 million increase in education funding \u2013 fractions of what teachers wanted. But after nine days of protests, lawmakers didn\u2019t budge. The walkout ended without all the funding teachers wanted. What\u2019s going to happen next: Disappointed by the lack of progress at the Capitol, some Oklahoma teachers are now running for state office. \u201cIt seems insane to me that we have to go to those lengths to get basic supplies,\u201d said teacher Laura Griesel, who\u2019s running for state representative. Teacher Kelly Craig said the legislature should brace for change in November. \u201cWhile it\u2019s disheartening that the walkout ended, the walkout forced change that Oklahomans will see this November,\u201d she said. What teachers wanted: Kentucky teachers also wanted more funding to pay for textbooks, technology and school programs. But what really fueled their protest was what they called a \u201cbait-and-switch\u201d move to make changes to their pensions. Lawmakers had slipped the changes to teachers\u2019 pensions into a bill about sewage and passed the bill. Kentucky and Oklahoma teachers flood state capitals Kentucky teachers denounced that move and also called for lawmakers to override the Gov. Matt Bevin\u2019s vetoes of House bills 200 and 366, about the budget and revenue. What they got: Teachers lost their fight over the pension reform bill, which Bevin signed into law. But the Kentucky Education Association applauded the legislature\u2019s decisions to override Bevin\u2019s vetoes of House bills 200 and 366. A compromise budget plan \u201cincreases per pupil SEEK funding to $4,000 per student, the highest dollar amount that has ever been appropriated,\u201d the KEA said. \u201cWe acknowledge neither bill gives the citizens of the Commonwealth everything that our students, their parents, and our communities need. \u2026 However, both bills provide much needed P-12 funding for the next biennium.\u201d High school teacher defeats Kentucky House GOP leader What\u2019s going to happen next: A high school teacher frustrated by lawmakers could become a House representative. Teacher Travis Brenda defeated House Majority Floor Leader Jonathan Shell in the Republican primary and now faces Democrat Mary Renfro in November\u2019s general election. Shell, the outgoing lawmaker, had a role in passing a controversial pension bill this year that sparked outrage from teachers. What teachers wanted: Arizona Educators United wanted a 20% raise for teachers by next school year and yearly raises after that until Arizona\u2019s teacher salaries reach the national average. Veteran Arizona teacher takes home $320 a week The group also wanted lawmakers to restore education funding to pre-recession 2008 levels and demanded no new tax cuts until per-student spending reached the national average. It laid out a goal of limiting class sizes to 23 students per class. What they got: It took six days, but Arizona teachers ended their walkout after the governor signed an education funding bill into law. This teacher could make $50,000 more by teaching 10 minutes away in California The measure, dubbed the \u201c#20x2020\u201d plan, raises teachers\u2019 pay by 20% over the next three years. The new law also increases funding for support staff, new textbooks, upgraded technology and infrastructure, which will help make up for recession-era cuts. What\u2019s going to happen next: While many teachers cheered the wins, some said the fight will continue. Arizona Educators United pointed out that several teacher-supported amendments didn\u2019t pass \u2013 like lowering the student-counselor ratio from 900:1 to 250:1. \u201cOverall the general consensus among teachers seems to be that this was a small win for now with many, many huge battles ahead,\u201d teacher Christina Waters tweeted. What teachers wanted: The Colorado Education Association wanted more education funding and a sustainable fix to  PERA, the state\u2019s public employees retirement program. Colorado teachers aren't alone in their protests Teachers were especially angry because Colorado basically underfunded schools this year by $828 million, the education association said. That\u2019s because Colorado hasn\u2019t kept up with a state constitutional mandate to increase funds each year by at least the rate of inflation. In addition to the statewide protest, teachers in Pueblo launched their own strike against the Pueblo City School District for five days. What they got: The Colorado Education Association said its legislative agenda largely succeeded \u201cto ultimately provide better outcomes for students \u2013 with the exception of PERA.\u201d The retirement program bill calls for increasing employee contributions and raises the age of retirement for new people in the system to 64. A stranger donated money to a teacher moonlighting as a grocery cashier. While the state protest had mixed results, the local teachers\u2019 strike in Pueblo was victorious. After five days, the teachers won concessions from the district such as a 2.5% cost of living adjustment for the next school year and a new health insurance contribution. What\u2019s going to happen next:  The Colorado Education Association said it\u2019s pleased with recent bills to help the teacher shortage \u2013 especially in rural areas, where attracting and retaining teachers is difficult \u201cThese bills are a start at tackling our growing educator shortage and we will look to build on this momentum next session.\u201d What teachers wanted: Although North Carolina teachers received raises in recent years, they were frustrated that they\u2019ve lost 9.4% in pay since 2009, when adjusted for inflation. Per-student funding also hasn\u2019t kept pace since the recession a decade ago. So the North Carolina Association of Educators wanted lawmakers to: \u2013 Invest more in spending per student \u2013 Create a multiyear pay plan for teachers and all other school personnel \u2013 Increase the number of school nurses, counselors, social workers and other support personnel \u2013 Create a statewide school construction board to fix crumbling schools and reduce large class sizes What they got: The day before teachers protested, state House speaker Tim Moore announced teachers can expect average raises of 6.2% for the upcoming school year. But it wasn\u2019t enough to stop the protest, and some teachers said they won\u2019t get a 6.2% raise.

I have a part-time job to help pay for it.\u201d #NCTeacherRally pic.twitter.com/Y7NlwAnTuf What\u2019s going to happen next: While the protest lasted only one day, the fight is far from over. \u201cIt\u2019s the beginning of a six-month stretch of time to hold our elected leaders accountable for prioritizing corporate tax cuts instead of our classrooms,\u201d the North Carolina Association of Educators said. \u201cThe ultimate goal is to elect more pro-public education leaders in North Carolina and to have long-term, sustainable victories.\u201d This wave of protests likely stemmed from a decade of simmering frustration finally boiling over, as teachers continuously had to do more with less. These teachers work up to 6 jobs to pay the bills \u201cDuring the recession, states across the country adopted austerity budgets that slashed funding for schools, and our students who need the most support bore the brunt of those cuts,\u201d National Education Association President Lily Eskelsen Garcia said. But while the economy has improved, in many places, teachers\u2019 raises haven\u2019t caught up. Ditto for per-student funding. \u201cSchool funding is the same thing \u2013 in a lot of states, it hasn\u2019t (reached) the same level of funding that it was before the recession,\u201d said Kency Nittler, manager of teacher trends for the National Council on Teacher Quality. These charts show why America's teachers are fired up Eskelsen Garcia lauded the victories made by teachers across the country this year. \u201cWest Virginia will now be able to attract and retain the best educators for their students. Oklahoma students and educators will see an additional half a billion dollars in resources for their classrooms, the largest education budget increase in state history. Arizona students now have a road map to smaller class sizes and educators that will be compensated at a livable level,\u201d Eskelsen Garcia said. \u201cBut there\u2019s still plenty of work to be done,\u201d she said. \u201cIf we don\u2019t see continual improvements in how state leaders prioritize our students, there will be accountability in November.\u201d CNN\u2019s Madison Park, Jason Hanna, Veronica Stracqualursi, Sarah Jorgensen, Isabella Gomez and Amanda Jackson contributed to this report.",

Viktor Vekselberg, chairman of asset manager Renova Group, is an oligarch close to Vladimir Putin, and last month the Trump administration placed him on a list of sanctioned Russians for activities including election interference. The purpose of the payments, which predate the sanctions, and the nature of the business relationship between Vekselberg and Cohen is unclear. The scrutiny of the payments could add to the legal troubles for Cohen. Republican leaders are breathing a sigh of relief this morning, as the US Senate candidacy\u00a0of former coal baron Don Blankenship crashed and burned in West Virginia. Blankenship served time in prison after a deadly mine explosion, traded in conspiracy theories on the campaign trail and even insulted Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. The GOP had worried Blankenship winning the primary would imperil its chances of defeating\u00a0vulnerable Democrat Joe Manchin in November. That wasn\u2019t the only good news for them. The primaries produced Senate nominees in Indiana and Ohio that party leaders believe are well positioned to win this fall.

Trump\u2019s anger was on full display after word got out that the agents reportedly seized documents and records related to the Stormy Daniels payment, among other things. Trump, arms crossed, fumed during a meeting with military advisers, openly mulling whether to fire special counsel Robert Mueller. The President also went after his attorney general, (once again) trashed the FBI and his own Justice Department and called the whole thing \u201can attack on our country.\u201d CNN\u2019s Stephen Collinson says the raid shows Cohen could be the bridge between two legal strands that threaten Trump: the Russia probe and the adult film star. A decision could come today or tomorrow about how the US will respond to the chemical attack on civilians in Syria. President Trump hasn\u2019t detailed what the response will be, but he promised it will be \u201cvery tough\u201d and that \u201cnothing\u2019s off the table.\u201d At least 49 people, many of them women and children, died in the weekend attack on Douma, the last rebel-held town in the country.

Constand, a former Temple University employee, said Cosby drugged and assaulted her in 2004 in\u00a0his home. Cosby has pleaded not guilty. His defense team gives its opening statements this morning. And before Cosby even walked into court, things got really bizarre\u00a0when a topless protester \u2013 with the words \u201cCosby rapist\u201d written on her back \u2013 jumped a barricade near Cosby and started chanting.

            "article_content": "Most pastors say they preach the truth. The Rev. William Barber also delivers sermons on another topic: \u201cthe trick.\u201d The trick is Barber\u2019s term for something that he describes as a weapon of mass distraction. It stymied the leaders of the populist movement in late 19th century. It vexed union leaders who promoted workers\u2019 solidarity. The Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. died trying to beat the trick. The trick is when white politicians persuade poor white working class people that the source of their pain is people of color, immigrants and other scapegoats, says Barber, who rose to national fame after helping lead Moral Mondays, a social justice movement formed in North Carolina. \u201cYou have to show them the trick,\u201d says Barber, his rich, baritone shifting into preaching mode when asked how he would address this challenge. \u201cThe majority of people in this country who are poor are white people. You have to undermine the trick and say, \u2018Listen, you want a living wage, but the people you voted for don\u2019t want a living wage. You\u2019re upset that you don\u2019t have health care. Guess what, black and Latino people aren\u2019t your problems. It\u2019s the people who are voting against health care.\u2019 \u201c Barber\u2019s message worked in North Carolina, and now he and others are taking it nationally on Monday to revive King\u2019s boldest crusade: the Poor People\u2019s Campaign. Organizers for a \u201cnew Poor People\u2019s Campaign\u201d and the Fight for $15 movement say they will launch rallies across the mid-South to raise awareness of the plight of the nation\u2019s poor. The campaign is calling for thousands of cooks and cashiers to walk off their jobs Monday and join protests in two dozen cities. A march is planned in Memphis, Tennessee, retracing the route King took during his fateful last campaign. And six weeks of \u201cdirect action and nonviolent civil disobedience\u201d are planned starting May 13, Mother\u2019s Day. Behind the flurry of events, this new campaign could provide an answer to a question that has long tantalized historians and activists: What if King had lived to see his Poor People\u2019s Campaign through. Could it have worked? It was certainly daring enough. King and his staff were mobilizing an interracial army to occupy Washington much like Occupy Wall Street set up camp in New York\u2019s financial district in 2011. He had recruited impoverished white residents of Appalachia, Latino farm workers from California and impoverished blacks from Mississippi. It was a Rainbow Coalition before the term was even coined. The campaign disintegrated, though, after King was assassinated in Memphis on April 4, 1968, while supporting a strike of black sanitation workers. The new Poor People\u2019s Campaign will follow part of the blueprint of King\u2019s old campaign, Barber says: build a movement across racial lines and across an array of issues. Call the new poor people\u2019s movement a civil rights campaign, though, and Barber immediately pounces. \u201cThat language is too puny \u2013 it\u2019s designed to divide,\u201d he says. \u201cWe didn\u2019t build a white movement or a black movement [in North Carolina]. We built a moral movement.\u201d The new campaign is supported by one of the nation\u2019s largest unions, the Service Employees International Union. The union has provided much of the organizational muscle and money behind the Fight for $15 campaign, which has helped organize fast-food workers across the nation and persuaded many states and cities to raise their minimum wage. Mary Kay Henry, the international president of the SEIU, says her union has committed to the new Poor People\u2019s Campaign beyond this year. She is already talking about how it could help mobilize voters for the 2020 presidential election. Henry also alluded to \u201cthe trick.\u201d Some say unions do a better job of inoculating white members from racist appeals because they promote relationships among people of different races. Henry evoked this tradition. \u201cWhite working people, when they are in relationship in union organizations, understand that we all have to join together to lift things up,\u201d she says. Even if King survived, some historians say the original Poor People\u2019s Campaign would have floundered because the nation had turned away from King and the poor by 1968. The terrain in Washington may be more difficult this time, with inequality even worse now than when King was alive. Barber, though, doesn\u2019t sound daunted. Social justice movements rarely start out as popular campaigns, he says.  When the abolitionist movement first mobilized against slavery, the slave-holding states in America held sway in Washington.  When King marched for voting rights in 1965, Congress and the President didn\u2019t want to act on the issue, he says. \u201cIf people in the civil rights movement had waited until people were with them,\u201d Barber says, \u201cthey would have waited forever.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Students at Iowa\u2019s Grinnell College pulled back Friday from a campaign to expand their two-year-old union over concerns that a Republican-dominated board in Washington could use it to strip all or most student workers of the right to bargain collectively. It\u2019s the latest organizing drive to hit pause in the face of a likely loss before the National Labor Relations Board, which since the election of President Donald Trump has rolled back many precedents set under the administration of Barack Obama. Dozens of organizing campaigns had gained momentum at schools ranging from Georgetown University to the University of Pittsburgh, driven by the rising costs of education \u2013 as well as a 2016 NLRB decision that solidified students\u2019 protections under federal labor law. But many schools have refused to bargain, rejecting the students\u2019 status as workers. Rather than appealing to the NLRB, unions have stopped in their tracks, fearful that the current board \u2013 now stacked with Republicans appointed by Trump \u2013 would use any opportunity to reverse the 2016 decision, thereby stripping students of the ability to form unions. \u201cThis Board has shown that they have a view of the Act that is not very hospitable towards worker organizing,\u201d said Sharon Block, a former board member who now directs the Labor and Work Life program at Harvard Law School. \u201cYou just can\u2019t discount the possibility that they would reverse that docket again.\u201d Grinnell undergraduates had formed a union of dining services workers in 2016, and voted last month to expand it to all 796 student workers on campus, from research assistants to library workers. The school\u2019s administration opposed the expansion effort, retaining two white-shoe law firms known for squashing union campaigns. After the election, Grinnell announced plans to appeal, arguing that students should not be considered \u201cemployees\u201d protected under federal labor law. Following two weeks of conversations with other student organizers across the country, the Grinnell organizers decided on Friday to withdraw their petition, which means the school will have no legal obligation to bargain with them. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to put the rights of hundreds of thousands of student workers across the country in jeopardy,\u201d said college junior Quinn Ercolani, president of the Union of Grinnell Student Dining Workers. Unions, which have been in decline across the country as their traditional strongholds in manufacturing have hemorrhaged jobs, have been having a moment among young people. Recent Pew Research and Gallup polls have found support for unions among millennials at 75% and 65% respectively, higher than any other age group. A spate of union victories at online publications like the Huffington Post, Vice News and Vox Media has raised the profile of labor organizing. The mounting cost of college is overwhelming stagnant work-study wages. That\u2019s what initially propelled Cory McCartan to organize at Grinnell as a freshman three years ago. Mopping floors, washing dishes and scrubbing pots was already tough work \u2013 but it was made harder by the fact that about one-out-of-every-five shifts went unfilled, meaning McCartan and his colleagues had to pick up the slack, making $8.50 an hour. \u201cI noticed right away that there was understaffing,\u201d said McCartan, who is now a senior. Instead of mounting a protest, he chose a course of action normally reserved for workers who aren\u2019t also in school: \u201cThe obvious solution was to form a union.\u201d McCartan succeeded, establishing the nation\u2019s first and only undergraduate union at a private university with no resistance from Grinnell administrators, who even hailed the new contract that raised wages to $9.76 an hour as a \u201cwin-win\u201d that would attract more workers to pick up shifts at the dining hall. So far, most of the interest has come from elite colleges, where aid packages are relatively generous and students have strong earning potential upon graduation. But Sara Goldrick-Rab, a professor at Temple University who focuses on affordability in higher education, said unions could have the biggest impact at more working-class institutions where the ability to earn a decent wage could make the difference between a student finishing their degree or having to drop out because of the cost. \u201cAs a college, if we think providing decently paid on campus work promotes retention, then it isn\u2019t just a labor issue,\u201d Goldrick-Rab said. \u201cIt could cost the university a little more, perhaps, than employing other folks. But it could save money if it keeps people in college.\u201d But winning and sustaining a union of college students is no easy feat. Until the Grinnell students organized, there was only one undergraduate union in the country: A group of 500 resident assistants and peer mentors at the University of Massachusetts-Amherst who organized with the United Auto Workers in 2002. On that campus, they had plenty of company, from graduate students to librarians. \u201cIt helps that UMass Amherst is just about wall-to-wall union,\u201d said Eve Weinbaum, an associate professor at the university\u2019s Labor Center. \u201cSo the undergrad workers have a lot of support, and the administration is used to dealing with different bargaining units, and figuring out what makes sense for each one.\u201d Unlike graduate students, who depend on the university for most of their livelihoods for six to eight years, undergraduates usually leave after four years and rarely work more than half-time on campus. Most unions pay for professional staff with their dues; the Grinnell union has optional dues and runs exclusively on volunteers. \u201cThe turnover issues and the ability of the university to stall, and challenge them legally, is a big battle,\u201d said Stephanie Luce, a professor of labor studies at the City University of New York. \u201cThe laws are so against workers. Going the traditional route is kind of destined to fail, almost.\u201d That\u2019s why college students have typically relied on activism to make gains for campus workers. United Students Against Sweatshops, for example, has expanded from its focus on the workers who make college apparel overseas to successful campaigns for a $15 minimum wage at New York University and Columbia. The Service Employees International Union, which has a division focused on adjunct instructors and grad students, says one of its demands is a $15 minimum wage for all student workers. Now, at least for the next few years, both graduate and undergraduate students may have to stick to activism without the supporting framework of labor law in order to win any gains. Graduate students at Loyola University Chicago voted to unionize in early 2017, but the administration has still refused to bargain a contract, saying it disagrees with the NLRB\u2019s 2016 decision concerning an election at Columbia University. \u201cThey are students in every sense of the word,\u201d the university said in a statement. \u201cTherefore, they do not qualify as \u2018employees\u2019 within the meaning of the National Labor Relations Act. Consistent with this position, shared by the higher education community, we maintain these students are not eligible for union representation.\u201d Normally, the union might file a protest with the NLRB, which could enforce the university\u2019s legal obligation to deal with the union. But since the board became dominated by Republicans, the union has held back for fear of triggering a wholesale repeal of the Columbia decision. \u201cThe concern is that the environment is unfavorable for us if the case came before the labor board,\u201d said Ella Wagner, a graduate student in history and a union organizer. Instead, the union has focused on applying pressure through other means to win stipend increases and other benefits. And it\u2019s not the only one: Several other graduate student organizing campaigns have withdrawn their petitions to the NLRB over the past year in order to avoid an adverse decision. Wagner said that while a reversal of the Columbia decision would be a blow, it wouldn\u2019t change the union\u2019s strategy of pushing the university for changes. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be here no matter what,\u201d she said. For its part, Grinnell says raising wages would force it to cut the number of work-study jobs and give them only to students with the greatest financial need. Because of that, the college said in a filing with the NLRB that expanding the union would deprive students of their right to privacy, and create an \u201cunderclass of serfs performing campus employment opportunities while their wealthy classmates simply concentrated on their studies.\u201d (The filing was later amended to remove that reference.) The students dismiss that argument as a false choice. The college, they say, could afford to pay students a few bucks more per hour without eliminating positions. In the dining hall, for example, students have gotten an 18% raise over the past two years, and McCartan said fewer shifts are going unfilled, although a college spokeswoman said that shortages persist. \u201cThese aren\u2019t really tangential to the university\u2019s mission,\u201d McCartan said. \u201cThey need us.\u201d",

            "article_content": "One of the Democratic Party\u2019s most prolific fundraisers says he has pledged to raise campaign money for rising political star Beto O\u2019Rourke should the Texas Democrat seek the presidency in 2020. Chicago financier Louis Susman, who served as finance chairman of John Kerry\u2019s 2004 presidential bid and was an early backer of President Barack Obama\u2019s White House ambitions in 2008, told CNN in a telephone interview he has met with O\u2019Rourke on a number of occasions and that he is encouraging him to run. \u201cIt\u2019s time to pass the torch to a new generation,\u201d said Susman, a former US Ambassador to United Kingdom in the Obama administration. \u201cI have nothing against the Bidens and Kerrys of the world and all of these senators that are looking at it, but I think the Beto example is what inspired people and what we are going to need.\u201d The support from Susman marks the latest sign of Democratic enthusiasm for O\u2019Rourke, a three-term congressman who raised record sums in his Senate bid and came within 3 percentage points of toppling Republican Sen. Ted Cruz in traditionally red Texas. A CNN tally also shows dozens of top Obama bundlers provided financial support to O\u2019Rourke\u2019s unsuccessful bid. But elite Democratic fundraisers interviewed by CNN in recent days \u2013 some of whom have longstanding ties to former Vice President Joe Biden \u2013 say they still are weighing their options in the presidential race, even if they donated to O\u2019Rourke\u2019s Senate campaign.  And many are calling for a competitive primary to send a battle-tested Democrat into the general election against President Donald Trump, who defied both political convention and better-funded candidates to capture the White House in 2016. \u201cWhat I\u2019m looking for this time is someone who can win Ohio, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Florida,\u201d Gary Hirshberg, the co-founder of organic yogurt producer Stonyfield Farm, said, ticking off crucial swing states Trump won two years ago. Democrats are making moves behind the scenes to gear up for 2020 Hirshberg, a top fundraiser for Obama\u2019s campaign and Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 White House bid, donated $500 to O\u2019Rourke\u2019s Senate campaign. But he said that doesn\u2019t translate into automatic support for a presidential bid should O\u2019Rourke run. Instead, he is taking a close look at other, more experienced Democrats, including Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown, who won a third term last month in a state Trump captured by eight percentage points, and John Hickenlooper, the former two-term governor of Colorado. \u201cI don\u2019t just need someone who can rock a rally,\u201d Hirshberg said. \u201cI\u2019m looking for somebody who demonstrates executive prowess and deep substance.\u201d Campaign bundlers, such as Susman and Hirshberg, play a crucial role in presidential campaigns because they can tap their extensive networks of business associates, family and friends to help collect or \u201cbundle\u201d the huge sums needed to mount a White House bid that could surpass the $2 billion mark for the parties\u2019 eventual nominees and the groups supporting them. A raft of potential Democratic contenders will compete for their financial backing. In addition to O\u2019Rourke, the potential Democratic field includes governors, at least seven US senators, sprinkling of business executives, and Obama administration veterans, such as former US Housing and Urban Development secretary Julian Castro and Biden, who told a Montana audience this week that he\u2019s the \u201cmost qualified person in the country to be president.\u201d At least two billionaires who can help fund their own campaigns, California environmental activist Tom Steyer and former New York mayor Michael Bloomberg, are also weighing bids. But a CNN analysis shows O\u2019Rourke has won the attention of some of Obama\u2019s biggest financial backers. At least 59 individuals who raised $500,000 or more for Obama\u2019s re-election in 2012 donated to O\u2019Rourke\u2019s 2018 campaign, CNN\u2019s tally finds. That surpasses the number of top bundlers who contributed to the federal fundraising vehicles established in this election cycle by other Democrats who have either declared their 2020 intentions or are pondering bids. For instance, only about two dozen people in the highest echelon of Obama bundlers had written checks to a fundraising committee, American Possibilities PAC, established by Biden to support other Democrats in the midterms, according to the review of donations reported to the Federal Election Commission through early this week. O\u2019Rourke has not declared his 2020 intentions, and a campaign aide declined to comment. In interviews, Democratic donors say they want a winner. Rusty Rueff, a philanthropist and veteran of California\u2019s tech industry, is among the top Obama bundlers who donated to O\u2019Rourke\u2019s Senate campaign, but he\u2019s made no choice in the presidential race and instead is rooting for a wide-open fight for the Democratic nomination in 2020. \u201cI felt like we went through a coronation, not a primary,\u201d he said of the 2016 presidential battle that featured Clinton and just four other contenders on the early debate stages. \u201cBecause of that, the Secretary (Clinton) never got a chance to have flushed out and taken care of many of the issues that needed to be taken care of before she went to the general election.\u201d In 2 months we'll have a real 2020 field Chief among them, according to Rueff: The controversy over Clinton\u2019s use of a private email server as secretary of state, which became a rallying cry for Trump and his allies in the general election. \u201cIn retrospect, the day that Bernie Sanders said he was tired of the \u2018damn emails\u2019 was a mistake for the party and for her,\u201d said Rueff, referring to Sanders\u2019 dismissal of the email controversy during the first Democratic primary debate in October 2015. Rueff said he\u2019s seeking a nominee who\u2019s focused on boosting the fortunes of working-class Americans and who offers a \u201ckindler and gentler\u201d approach to politics. But at the end of the day, he said: \u201cMy only choice is someone who can beat Donald Trump.\u201d Other elite fundraisers say their decisions may be months away. Robert Wolf, the former chairman and CEO of UBS Americas and a leading fundraiser in the Obama and Clinton campaigns, donated to $1,000 to O\u2019Rourke\u2019s campaign and $5,000 to Biden\u2019s political action committee. But Wolf said he\u2019s still weighing his options and has met with \u201cseveral individuals over the last month\u201d who are considering White House bids.  He declined to name those potential candidates. Wolf, who now runs his own economic consulting firm, said he may provide initial financial support to several contenders to help Democrats build a large and competitive field. \u201cDo I want 25 candidates? No,\u201d he said. \u201cBut if there are a dozen strong candidates and there\u2019s truly a primary where people get to voice their views and concerns, that\u2019s a good thing.\u201d Other Obama bundlers who donated to O\u2019Rourke say they still await Biden\u2019s next move. William Freeman, the co-founder of a Nashville real-estate investment and management company, donated to $350 to O\u2019Rourke\u2019s campaign, federal election records show. He praised O\u2019Rourke for injecting \u201cadrenaline and excitement\u201d into a longshot bid for Democrats in Texas but said he\u2019s still hoping for a 2020 contender with a longer track record in politics. That includes Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, Clinton or a \u201cwild card,\u201d such as former Tennessee governor Phil Bredesen, who lost a Senate bid last month to Republican Marsha Blackburn. But if Biden entered the contest, \u201cit would be hard for me not to get behind him,\u201d Freeman added. He said the former vice president offers a more \u201cpredictable\u201d approach to governing than Trump does. Richard Harpootlian, a former South Carolina Democratic Party chairman and prominent Biden supporter, also donated to O\u2019Rourke\u2019s Senate campaign, along with those of several other potential 2020 contenders, including Klobuchar and Brown, federal records show. But Harpootlian said he remains a stalwart Biden backer. \u201cJoe Biden is the only guy in the field right now, man or woman, black or white, young or old, that can win against Donald Trump in 2020,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m with Biden and will be with Biden until and unless Biden says he\u2019s not running.\u201d CNN\u2019s Aaron Kessler contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Bruce Springsteen isn\u2019t a big fan of President Donald Trump. \u201cHe\u2019s deeply damaged at his core,\u201d the New Jersey-born rocker recently told Esquire magazine. \u201cAnyone in that position who doesn\u2019t deeply feel those ties that bind is a dangerous man, and it\u2019s very pitiful.\u201d That\u2019s no big surprise. Springsteen is an outspoken liberal; he campaigned for John Kerry in 2004 and performed at Barack Obama\u2019s second inauguration. What IS a big surprise is what Springsteen told the Sunday Times in an interview in advance of the release later this month of his long-running Broadway show on Netflix. \u201cI don\u2019t see anyone out there at the moment \u2026 the man who can beat Trump, or the woman who can beat Trump,\u201d Springsteen said of the potential 2020 Democratic field. \u201cYou need someone who can speak some of the same language [as Trump] \u2026 and the Democrats don\u2019t have an obvious, effective presidential candidate.\u201d Which is an interesting analysis \u2013 particularly when you consider that the Democratic field is likely to be the largest in modern American history, with two dozen (or more) candidates expected to run. One would think that, given the expected size of the field, there would be at least one candidate \u2013 and maybe a few \u2013 who Springsteen believes can take on and beat Trump. And Springsteen\u2019s specific doubt about the Democratic field \u2013 \u201cyou need someone who can speak some of the same language\u201d as the President \u2013 is a very important one. Dismiss Springsteen as just another liberal rock star if you will (and he is!), but also remember that Springsteen\u2019s roots are in a working-class, blue-collar community \u2013 and that he has spent his entire life writing about and trying to explain the hopes, fears and anxieties of those communities to the country and the world. Trump spoke to those fears and hopes in a very direct and real way during the 2016 campaign. He won the White House thanks to victories in the industrial Midwest \u2013 Michigan, Wisconsin and Ohio \u2013 that was hit the hardest by the rapidly changing 21st-century economy and the crushing blows it dealt to the manufacturing sector. \u201cDonald J. Trump won the presidency by riding an enormous wave of support among white working-class voters,\u201d concluded The New York Times\u2019 Nate Cohen the day after the 2016 election. Trump won white, non-college educated males 71%-23% over Hillary Clinton and white, non-college educated women 61% to 34%, according to exit polling. Those white, non-college educated voters comprised one-third of the overall electorate. (\u201cNon-college educated,\u201d of course, doesn\u2019t equal \u201cblue-collar,\u201d but history has shown there are strong similarities among those groups and their voting preferences.) There is zero question \u2013 particularly when you consider the crushing blow Democrats delivered to Republicans in the suburbs in the 2018 midterms \u2013 that Trump\u2019s path to a second term relies heavily on these same blue collar whites who got him elected President in the first place. THE POINT -- NOW ON YOUTUBE! \nIn each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe! And like it or not, Trump does, as Springsteen notes, understand how to not only talk to this group but convince them that he is their champion, that he is a voice for the previously voiceless. This, from Trump\u2019s inauguration speech, captures that sentiment nicely: \u201cJanuary 20th 2017, will be remembered as the day the people became the rulers of this nation again. \u201cThe forgotten men and women of our country will be forgotten no longer. \u201cEveryone is listening to you now. \u201cYou came by the tens of millions to become part of a historic movement the likes of which the world has never seen before.\u201d Trump makes this appeal by casting himself as a man of the people \u2013 fighting against elite snobbery and political correctness. (Yes, I am well aware of the irony of a man born into wealth and raised in New York City emerging as the voice of the working class.) \u201cWhy are they elite?\u201d Trump asked a crowd at a rally in Minnesota over the summer. \u201cI have a much better apartment than they do. I\u2019m smarter than they are. I became president and they didn\u2019t. And I\u2019m representing the best people on earth, the deplorables.\u201d Looking through that lens \u2013 as Springsteen is doing \u2013 you can understand the rocker\u2019s concerns. Kamala Harris, the current frontrunner in the 2020 rankings I do with Harry Enten, is a senator from California. Elizabeth Warren is an unapologetic liberal from Massachusetts. Bernie Sanders is a democratic socialist from Vermont. None of that group has an obvious appeal to blue-collar white workers that would trump Trump\u2019s \u2013 at least at first glance. That said, I do think there are candidates in the field \u2013 or potential field \u2013 who would fit more of what Springsteen is looking for. Former Vice President Joe Biden has practically changed his middle name to \u201cHardscrabble roots in Scranton.\u201d And Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown is the sort of gravel-voiced populist that might appeal to Bruce. Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, is not nearly as well known as Biden and Brown but has a similar pitch \u2013 that Democrats need to start reaching Midwesterner voters, especially white working class ones, again. The question before Democrats, to my mind, is not whether they have a candidate \u2013 or candidates \u2013 who can fight Trump for white blue-collar voters in the Midwest by speaking some of the \u201csame language\u201d as Trump, to borrow Springsteen\u2019s phrasing. The question is whether the party\u2019s base, which is increasingly coastal, non-white and liberal, wants to even consider a candidate like that as the party\u2019s standard-bearer against Trump. If 2018 is any indication, they don\u2019t. No matter what Springsteen thinks.",

            "article_content": "President Donald Trump was only a half-hour into his nine-hour flight to the G20 summit here in the Argentine capital when he decided to pull the plug on the most hotly anticipated moment of his trip: a lengthy face-to-face with Russian President Vladimir Putin. But while Trump\u2019s abrupt decision quashed concerns that the President would repeat his cozy performance alongside Putin during their last meeting in Helsinki, Finland, new allegations by the President\u2019s former longtime attorney Michael Cohen revived questions about Trump\u2019s financial ties to Russia as he arrived for the international summit. Trump\u2019s planned meetings with a half-dozen other world leaders \u2013 combined with the possibility of diplomatic snafus \u2013 offer little promise of clearing the smoke of suspicion that is once again following him abroad. The President also refused to back away from the shadow of the Mueller investigation, beginning his day with a fresh pair of tweets about the Cohen saga, saying his business dealings while a candidate were \u201cvery legal & very cool.\u201d Hours later, the White House press secretary Sarah Sanders issued a statement blaming the \u201cRussian Witch Hunt Hoax\u201d \u2013 a reference to special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation \u2013 for hurting US-Russia relations. \u201cThe Russian Witch Hunt Hoax, which is hopefully now nearing an end, is doing very well. Unfortunately, it probably does undermine our relationship with Russia,\u201d Sanders said, even as she insisted Trump\u2019s meeting with Putin was canceled because of Russia\u2019s seizure of Ukrainian Navy ships and sailors earlier this week. Trump also said the situation in Ukraine was his \u201csole reason\u201d for scrapping the meeting. A Kremlin spokesman told Russian state media earlier Friday that Trump and Putin would have a \u201cbrief impromptu meeting\u201d on the sidelines of the G20. Though the two leaders are likely to see each other and shake hands alongside other leaders at the international summit, a White House official said no meeting had been rescheduled between the two leaders. The official said the Kremlin appeared to be \u201ctrying to save face\u201d with the Friday morning statement. Trump abruptly cancels planned Putin meeting Trump arrived in Buenos Aires for the summit late Thursday night, marking the first time he has set foot in Latin America in his nearly two years in office and kicking off what promises to be a whirlwind 48-hour visit. Friday will amount to the President\u2019s busiest day of diplomacy, but his most important meeting of the summit \u2013 his dinner with Chinese President Xi Jinping \u2013 doesn\u2019t come until a day later. Trump\u2019s aides hoped a signing ceremony for the recently struck United States-Mexico-Canada trade agreement would act as a centerpiece of the trip. At the Friday morning event, Trump hailed the revised NAFTA free trade deal, rebranded as the USMCA, as a \u201ctruly groundbreaking achievement\u201d alongside his Canadian and Mexican counterparts. Persistent disputes with Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau \u2013 including over US steel and aluminum tariffs \u2013 led to questions about who precisely from the Canadian side would be doing the signing, but Trudeau stood next to Trump and touted the deal as a success for middle class workers. Still, he pressed Trump during the event to remove steel and aluminum tariffs imposed earlier this year. Trump has hailed the agreement as evidence of his negotiating prowess and said the pact would benefit American workers. He\u2019s been unnerved in recent days by a shaky stock market and factory closures by General Motors, according to people familiar with the matter, and is hoping to be able to tout the new trade agreement in Argentina. Trade and security lead Trump's ambitious G20 agenda Trump was darting from bilateral meetings to summit sessions and back, starting with an early morning breakfast alongside Argentine President Mauricio Macri, the summit\u2019s host. Trump has known Macri for decades, beginning when both were real estate developers. \u201cI want to just say I\u2019ve been friends with Mauricio for a long time, many years,\u201d Trump said at the Casa Rosada, the presidential mansion. \u201cHe was a young man, a handsome man.\u201d Trump recollected a deal with Macri\u2019s family to develop the West Side railroad yards \u2013 one of the \u201clargest jobs in Manhattan,\u201d in Trump\u2019s telling. \u201cThat was in my civilian days,\u201d Trump said. \u201cLittle did you realize I would become president.\u201d Trump said in their meeting, he\u2019d discuss trade and military purchases with the Argentine president. From there, Trump joined the large gathering of G20 leaders, finding himself face-to-face with the collection of global leaders he has sometimes rebuffed. The gathering of leaders also gave way to a brief encounter with the Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the first time Trump has met with the crown prince in person since the murder of the Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi. Trump \u201cexchanged pleasantries\u201d with bin Salman, a White House official said. Asked about the encounter, Trump said he and the crown prince \u201chad no discussion.\u201d \u201cWe might, but we had none,\u201d he said. White most of the world has castigated bin Salman, Trump has taken the opposite approach, indicating he has no plans to cut ties to Saudi Arabia. A pull-aside chat is scheduled with Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdo\u011fan, whose government has pushed for greater punishment of Saudi Arabia for Khashoggi\u2019s killing, which occurred at a consulate in Istanbul. Trump is also slated to speak on the sidelines with South Korean President Moon Jae-in, who has acted as an avid cheerleader for Trump\u2019s diplomatic opening with North Korea. Less enthusiastic has been Japanese President Shinzo Abe, who\u2019s expressed concern about easing pressure on Pyongyang without any corresponding steps from the North Korean regime. Abe also offered hyperbolic praise as he sat before the cameras alongside his US counterpart, congratulating Trump \u201con your historic victory in the midterm elections in the United States.\u201d The Japanese President appeared to follow a pattern of foreign leaders who have sought to compliment the US President in these settings. While Trump has touted the midterm election results in such terms, the midterm election results amounted to a stinging rebuke of Trump as Democrats picked up nearly 40 seats in the House of Representatives. Trump was supposed to sit later in the day with German Chancellor Angela Merkel, who hosted last year\u2019s G20 and has withstood sustained attacks by Trump over auto imports and trade. But Merkel\u2019s government plane suffered technical problems en route, and she was forced to turn back to Cologne. She was expected to arrive late to the summit, and the meeting did not appear on Trump\u2019s schedule for Friday. Merkel recently announced that she will not run for another term as chancellor after acting as Europe\u2019s de facto leader for more than a decade. G20 members are also bracing for US intransigence as the leaders work to release a final joint communique from the assembled leaders \u2013 a Trump administration position that has hampered efforts to release communiques at past summits. A source familiar with discussions said US national security adviser John Bolton has positioned the US\u2019s stance on the communique\u2019s language as a take-it-or-leave-it offer. A White House official said the US is \u201ccommitted to working toward consensus on the communique but will stand firm against language that prejudices US positions and is willing to walk away if necessary.\u201d The official said the US is leaving some room for compromise, but has made clear that there are certain positions regarding the communique that are non-negotiable. At least \u201cnot right now,\u201d the official said. Ultimately, a decision on the communique will come down to the President himself \u2013 and his willingness to compromise versus being cast as the odd man out. Hanging over it all will be the questions sparked by the latest twist in special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s ongoing investigation \u2013 just the latest instance of the Mueller investigation following Trump outside the United States. The President\u2019s international trips have been repeatedly marred by developments in the investigation, beginning with Mueller\u2019s appointment as special counsel just two days before Trump left for his first international trip. The President has publicly and privately groused that he thinks the investigation has hampered his diplomatic efforts on the world stage. Trump\u2019s second foreign trip, in July 2017, became another key moment in the Mueller investigation as the President and his aides worked to craft a statement on behalf of his eldest son concerning the now-infamous meeting with a Russian lawyer at Trump Tower a year prior. A year later, as the President prepared to fly to Helsinki to meet with Putin, the Justice Department announced the indictment of Russian intelligence officers linked to election interference. The Cohen plea agreement on Thursday became the latest example, and soon after the news emerged Trump moved to scrap his meeting with Putin. The White House said Trump had decided to cancel the get-together following a meeting with his top foreign policy advisers after boarding Air Force One, even though no new information had publicly emerged. Scrapping the meeting with Putin, though, did not eliminate all of the President\u2019s flair for make-or-break drama. He is still scheduled to join Xi, the Chinese President, for a working dinner on Saturday to hash out a possible ceasefire to the trade war that has roiled their countries and threatens to wreak havoc on the global economy if the ratcheting-up persists. Leaving the White House on Thursday, Trump kept the global suspense going. \u201cI think we\u2019re very close to doing something with China, but I don\u2019t know that I want to do it, because what we have right now is billions and billions of dollars coming into the United States in the form of tariffs or taxes. So I really don\u2019t know,\u201d the President said before departing Washington. \u201cBut I will tell you that I think China wants to make a deal. I\u2019m open to making a deal. But, frankly, I like the deal we have right now.\u201d CNN\u2019s Michelle Kosinski and Jim Acosta contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "House Democrats on Friday unveiled the outline for their first legislative push in the new Congress \u2013 a bill that would aimed at substantial government reforms on everything from voter rights to campaign finance to ethics requirements in Washington to the documents presidential candidates must hand over when they win the nomination. A Democratic aide told CNN that \u201cthe bill would require presidential nominees to release their returns from the three most recent taxable years.\u201d The bill \u2013 which Democrats are calling \u201cH.R. 1\u201d \u2013 isn\u2019t expected to pass in a Republican-controlled Senate or be signed into law by President Donald Trump. But it nevertheless acts as a statement of priorities for House Democratic priorities and is what Democrats plan to make their first order of business in January when they take control of the House. Here's the lawmaker who can request Trump's tax returns Longtime House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi, who is vying to reclaim the title of House speaker next year, said on Friday at a news conference on the legislative push that the new class of incoming House Democrats is focused on \u201cintegrity in government.\u201d Pelosi added that it \u201cwill be transformative to Congress when we reduce the role of money, amplify the voice of everyday Americans so that they know that their voices matter.\u201d During his campaign for office, then-candidate Trump broke with presidential election norms when he refused to produce his tax returns for public review, and he has repeatedly refused to requests to release them since he\u2019s been in office. White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders told earlier this fall she is \u201cnot aware of any plans\u201d for the President to release his tax returns. Dean Phillips, an incoming Democratic lawmaker from Minnesota, said during the news conference that voters want House Democrats to \u201ctackle the culture of corruption in Washington.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s time to elevate the common interest over special interests, time to return to a government that is of the people, by the people, and for the people. It\u2019s as simple as that,\u201d Phillips said. A fact sheet on the legislation describes three main goals: improving voting access by making it easier to vote, pushing back on big money in politics through a variety of reforms and making sure that \u201cpublic officials work for the public interest.\u201d To make it easier to vote, Democrats are promising to \u201cend partisan gerrymandering, stop voter purging, and reaffirm Congress\u2019 commitment to restore the Voting Rights Act,\u201d the document states. To take on big money in politics, Democrats aim to \u201crequire all political organizations to disclose their donors\u201d and \u201ctighten rules on Super PACs.\u201d To make public officials serve the public interest, the party says it will \u201cexpand conflict of interest law, require Presidential disclosure of tax returns, slow the revolving door, prohibit members of Congress from serving on for-profit boards, limit first class travel and end taxpayer financed settlements for officeholders.\u201d Rep. John Sarbanes of Maryland described the legislative proposal on Friday as \u201ca broad, comprehensive package of democracy reforms.\u201d The Maryland Democrat argued that the public needs to have confidence in the integrity of elections and their access to the ballot and that voters want officials in Washington to \u201cact with ethics and integrity\u201d and want lawmakers to \u201crepresent the American people,\u201d not political insiders. The effort to debut a legislative package even before the next Congress starts is an indication that House Democrats are already working to push a unified message to the American public about what they stand for, what they will do in power, and how they will deliver for voters. During the news conference on Friday, Pelosi also addressed the fact that congressional oversight of the Trump administration is expected to take center stage as a key priority for House Democrats once the new Congress gavels in. \u201cMake no mistake, oversight is a congressional responsibility,\u201d Pelosi said. \u201cThe administration may try to say oversight is investigation. No, oversight is our responsibility \u2026 we will honor our responsibilities.\u201d",

            "article_content": "House Democrats on Thursday elected Rep. Cheri Bustos to serve as the next chair of the House Democratic campaign arm, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. Bustos represents a congressional district in Illinois that President Donald Trump won in 2016. \u201cWe won a mandate from the American public from hard-working people to get results,\u201d Bustos said at a press conference following her win, referring to the party\u2019s midterm victory. But, she acknowledged, \u201cWe don\u2019t have the Senate. We don\u2019t have the White House,\u201d adding, \u201cSo it is now very important that we run a world-class political arm of the House Democrats. Absolutely imperative. We\u2019ve got to take a look at every single district in this country. That\u2019s what we intend to do. Every battlefield will be protected and contested. That will be our role.\u201d Bustos ran against Reps. Denny Heck and Suzan DelBene, both of Washington state. The vote totals were 117 for Bustos, 83 for Heck and 32 for DelBene. Rep. Sean Patrick Maloney of New York had also been running for the post of DCCC chair, but he dropped his bid, an aide to the congressman confirmed to CNN on Thursday. Earlier in the week, Maloney asked for a delay in the DCCC chair election after being hospitalized due to a bacterial infection. \u201cWe\u2019ve got 31 Democrats in Trump districts,\u201d Bustos said, adding, \u201cWe\u2019ve got to make sure we hang onto those tough seats. I\u2019m one of them. I come from a Trump district, but I won by 24 points. I won by the largest majority of any Democrat in any Trump district in this entire country so I know how to do this. I know how to protect this House. I know how to build this House.\u201d Democrats held a second-day of closed-door elections on Thursday to vote for party leadership in the new Congress when Democrats will control the House of Representatives after prevailing over Republicans in the 2018 midterm elections. The main event in the leadership elections took place on Wednesday when a majority of House Democrats voted to nominate Nancy Pelosi to serve as House Speaker. The vote was 203-32, meaning that Peolsi will still need to flip more than a dozen \u201cno\u201d votes to reach 218 votes in a final House floor vote in January, though it is possible to win the gavel with fewer votes in certain scenarios. In a separate election on Thursday, Rep. David Cicilline of Rhode Island was picked to serve as chair of the House Democratic Policy and Communications Committee, which is responsible for helping to craft messaging that defines what House Democrats stand for. Reps. Ted Lieu of California, Matt Cartwright of Pennsylvania and Debbie Dingell of Michigan were elected to serve as co-chairs of the DPCC. CNN\u2019s Annie Grayer contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "A Louisiana mom, running for office for the first time, thought about taking her kindergartner and her 1\u00bd-year-old along with her on the campaign trail. But she realized that probably wouldn\u2019t work. So, Morgan Lamandre asked the board that oversees election rules if she could use political donations to cover child care expenses that wouldn\u2019t exist if she weren\u2019t running. Those might include times she\u2019s headlining a fundraiser and her husband is with her or traveling for work. Candidates in other states, particularly mothers, have made similar bids this year and won. Not only was Lamandre\u2019s request rejected, but the response she got reflected \u201csome veiled sexism\u201d and perhaps an outdated take on politics and the American family, the 35-year-old attorney told CNN. \u201cChild care \u2026 should come before public office or anything else,\u201d Lamandre was told by 76-year-old board member Charles Emile \u201cPeppi\u201d Bruneau Jr., a retired legislator who steered the debate before the matter was denied, 5-2. \u201cLife is full of choices, and that\u2019s one of them,\u201d Bruneau said, according to the official recording of the November 16 board meeting. \u201cNobody forces you to run for public office. But you have a child, and that is your primary responsibility, to provide for that child. \u201cI don\u2019t think you need to be raising money to run for an office to do that,\u201d he continued. \u201cI just think it\u2019s a misplaced priority.\u201d Bruneau, a grandfather who recalled his experience in the 1970s as a state lawmaker with small kids, also pressed Lamandre on her appreciation for the demands of the Legislature, asking, \u201cIf you get elected, are you going to quit your regular job?\u201d To Lamandre, a lawyer in Baton Rouge for a nonprofit that serves sexual assault survivors, the line of questioning exposed a bias rooted in old stereotypes but still in play today. \u201cI still don\u2019t think men have the same barriers as women to running because maybe the women in their lives just pick up\u201d parenting obligations, she said. Already, Lamandre\u2019s case has spurred a push among Louisiana lawmakers to write an allowance for child care expenses into state election law. A glass-ceiling shattering night for women \u201cHaving kids doesn\u2019t \u2018disqualify\u2019 you from serving when we\u2019re constantly making decisions (affecting) families w/ small kids,\u201d tweeted state Sen. J.P. Morrell, along with an image of himself and his young son, Alexander, at a statehouse dais, with the note, \u201cDue to my wife being in Nursing School, my kids were underfoot EVERYWHERE during last session.\u201d The episode follows similar requests in at least six states from mothers hoping to use political contributions to hire sitters while they worked to get elected. In those cases, opponents echoed arguments similar to Bruneau\u2019s, along with fears of broad fiscal abuse. Bruneau did not immediately respond to CNN\u2019s requests for comment. But candidates and advocates, who already are beyond the midterms and looking ahead to 2020, say allowing campaign dollars to be spent for child care directly related to campaign work is critical to making sure elected bodies more closely reflect their constituencies. \u201cThis is an important bridge to cross because women don\u2019t feel like the opportunity is there for them because they have a family, they have responsibilities. A lot of women feel like the door isn\u2019t open to them,\u201d said Danielle Noel of Emerge America, which recruits and trains Democratic women to run for office. \u201cWe don\u2019t feel like being a mother should limit your ability to serve your country in this way,\u201d she said. The spate of official inquiries came during an election season in which women, many of them rookie candidates spurred by opposition to President Donald Trump, made historic political gains, including winning a record number of seats in Congress. \u201cAs a single mother, my primary concern when considering a run for office was how it would affect my child,\u201d Cynthia Kaump tweeted in June after ethics officials in Wisconsin approved her request to use campaign contributions to cover child care related to her bid for state treasurer. Another request made its way to the Federal Election Commission, which in May allowed New York congressional candidate Liuba Grechen Shirley, who appeared before the panel with her 3-year-old daughter and 2-year-old son, to use campaign dollars to pay for the children\u2019s care in limited circumstances related to campaigning. Her appeal was backed by 26 members of Congress and former Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton, among others. FEC approves NY candidate's request to use campaign funds for childcare \u201cWe\u2019re not creating a wholesale carve-out for child care,\u201d FEC Vice Chair Ellen Weintraub said during a public meeting. \u201cYou still can\u2019t use campaign funds for babysitting on date night.\u201d In Alabama, state House candidate Jennifer Gray\u2019s campaign hinged in part on her experience as a mother. \u201cBut I defy you to go have an hour (campaign-related) meeting \u2026 with a 10-year-old on the autism spectrum,\u201d she told CNN. \u201cNothing productive is going to happen.\u201d So, Gray asked for permission to use campaign dollars to pay for qualified sitters. The Ethics Commission director reportedly countered the notion that an expense as intimate as child care should only be paid from a candidate\u2019s personal coffers by citing other bills that can be covered by a campaign kitty, including car expenses, hotel and meal costs, and legal expenses, when they are tied directly with campaign activity. \u201cFor my commissioners, the need for child care in limited circumstances was at least equally important with these other uses which no one really argues about,\u201d Tom Albritton told AL.com in discussing the board\u2019s June ruling in Gray\u2019s favor. Iowa ethics officials made a similar comparison in a case there but punted the decision to lawmakers. In Texas, as elsewhere, ethics officials weighed the chance loopholes could be exploited when they considered Wichita County Commission candidate Catie Robinson\u2019s argument that letting political donations pay for child care might \u201chelp a lot of other women and just parents in general in Texas who either are running or want to run for office,\u201d CNN affiliate KLBK reported. Officials\u2019 voted in June to let her expense child care costs to her campaign. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of just where the law is catching up with the times,\u201d Robinson told the TV station. And Gayatri Agnew won her bid to use political funds to pay for sitters midway through her Arkansas House race. She spent less than $200 of it toward the care of her children, ages 2 and 4, so she and her husband both could attend key campaign events, she told CNN. But even having to make the request, she said, sent the message: \u201cThis is not your club.\u201d \u201cWhen you still have people writing the rules that are of a different time, it\u2019s very hard for a 30-something mom who\u2019s choosing to seek public office while working full time and raising kids to do that,\u201d Agnew said. \u201cIf we want our political system to evolve and we want to have the voice of moms \u2026 something\u2019s got to give.\u201d In Louisiana, Lamandre\u2019s case has rankled not only lawmakers. Columnist Chelsea Brasted of The Times-Picayune | NOLA.com penned a snarky piece with this opening: \u201cI had to take off my apron and stick my Jell-O mold in the ice box to come talk to you about this.\u201d Brasted noted that the Louisiana Ethics Board\u2019s own staff attorney reminded members weighing Lamandre\u2019s appeal that the same panel in 2000 allowed a male lawmaker to pay for \u201cchildcare (babysitting) expenses \u2026 from campaign funds since they are related to your campaign.\u201d Women candidates challenged by history, party and sexism \u201cBut a woman asking for the same treatment?\u201d Brasted wrote. \u201cI\u2019m clutching my pearls, y\u2019all, I am!\u201d For her part, the decision won\u2019t derail Lamandre\u2019s campaign to win a state House seat next year, she told CNN, though it has forced her to defend a role that normally goes unquestioned. \u201cI love being a mother,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is not about me not wanting my responsibility as a mother.\u201d She\u2019s also using social media to make sure others who might be affected by the board\u2019s ruling know they can ask for it to be reconsidered, in hopes more working parents might get involved in politics. \u201cThere\u2019s already certain opportunities for a certain class of people to be able to run for office that others wouldn\u2019t, so this gives the opportunity for two working parents to be able to run for office that wouldn\u2019t otherwise have the extra funds to be able to run for office,\u201d Lamandre told the Ethics Board. \u201cThis allows more people to represent who is in our state, who is in our communities,\u201d she said. \u201cIt gives more people a chance to actually have reflective representation.\u201d CORRECTION: This story has been updated to correct the spelling of Danielle Noel.",

            "article_content": "Richard Ojeda, the former congressional candidate who lost his 2018 bid as a Democrat in southern West Virginia, is running for president in 2020. \u201cI\u2019m Richard Ojeda and I\u2019m running for the President of the United States of America,\u201d he announced Monday at the Korean War Veterans Memorial in Washington, DC. Prior to his announcement, Ojeda filed with the Federal Election Commission to run for President and teased the run in an email to supporters on Sunday night. Ojeda\u2019s entry to the race is unexpected and highlights just how massive the Democratic field for President will be in 2020. Democratic operatives believe big-name candidates will announce presidential bids in early 2019, but fully expect candidates like Ojeda and others to explore a run starting in late 2018. Ojeda\u2019s unique candidacy \u2013 he is a former Army paratrooper who ran on the Democratic ticket as a populist and Trump critic in Republican West Virginia \u2013 markedly over-performed how Hillary Clinton did in the state in 2016. Trump won the state\u2019s 3rd Congressional District by 49 percentage points in 2016. Ojeda closed that gap, losing by 12 percentage points earlier this month. But getting through a Democratic primary could be difficult: Ojeda voted for Trump in 2016, something that may be beyond the pale for some Democrats. Ojeda has soured on Trump, though, and Trump called him \u201ca total whacko\u201d at campaign events in 2018. At his announcement on Monday, Ojeda said, \u201cI think I relate to the people far more than what the President can ever relate to these people. The very people he comes down to West Virginia and stands in front of could never afford one single round of golf in some of his fancy country clubs. That\u2019s not where I stand.\u201d He continued, \u201cI stand with the working-class citizens. I am a Democrat because I believe in what the Democratic Party is supposed to be: taking care of our working-class citizens.\u201d Although Ojeda handily lost to Republican Carol Miller, he told his supporters in an email on Sunday that his run taught him people across the country were feeling the same pain that he has seen in Appalachia. \u201cEveryday, hundreds of letters poured in from around the country where you shared your stories with me. You wrote about not being able to afford college, losing loved ones to drug addiction and struggling day-to-day to make ends meet,\u201d he writes. \u201cThis is an American problem and it has to change.\u201d Ojeda has long argued that the Democratic Party has lost its roots and become a party controlled by special interests and wealthy donors, and his presidential campaign will likely hinge on that message. He closes the email by inviting supporters to join him for a noon ET announcement. Ojeda got ahead of the announcement, however, by filing a presidential committee with the FEC and sitting down for an interview with The Intercept, where he announced his intention to run. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have quite a few lifetime politicians that are going to throw their hat in the ring, but I guarantee you there\u2019s going to be a hell of a lot more of them than there are people like myself that is, a working-class person that basically can relate to the people on the ground, the people that are actually struggling,\u201d he told The Intercept. \u201cI\u2019m not trying to throw stones at people that are rich, but once again, we will have a field that will be full of millionaires and I\u2019m sure a few billionaires.\u201d",

One of President Donald Trump\u2019s closest allies in Congress may soon take over the critical Senate Judiciary Committee. Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina is in line to wield the Judiciary gavel if the current chairman, Iowa\u2019s Chuck Grassley, decides to lead the Senate Finance Committee instead, CNN\u2019s Manu Raju reports. \u201cHe\u2019s expressed concerns about the way the Russia investigation has been conducted, the way the Clinton email investigation was being conducted,\u201d Raju said. \u201cSo we\u2019ll see if he brings a counterbalance to the House Judiciary Committee, which next year is going to be very aggressive in investigating the President.\u201d As chairman, Graham would also help shepherd any possible Trump Supreme Court nomination \u2013 and there may be a key difference between him and the President on that topic. \u201cHe told me after the Kavanaugh confirmation that if there\u2019s a vacancy in 2020, he\u2019s reluctant to move forward with a nominee, to hold to the precedent\u201d that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell established in 2016 when he refused to consider the Merrick Garland nomination. \u201cWe\u2019ll see if he ultimately stands by that, if it actually happens.\u201d Utah voters showed signs of a progressive streak on Election Day: Voters there approved referendums to expand Medicaid and to legalize medical marijuana. \u201cThis is an extremely conservative state, one of the most conservative states in the country,\u201d the AP\u2019s Julie Pace said. \u201cBut voters there still passed two ballot initiatives that tend to be favored by more liberal voters.\u201d \u201cThis is really a fascinating example of two initiatives that were stalled by deeply conservative lawmakers in the state, and then it went to the voters, who ultimately pushed both of these issues over the finish line,\u201d Pace said. At least 102 women were elected to the House last week, smashing previous records. And Politico\u2019s Rachael Bade said it could have a very real impact in the halls of Congress. \u201cMany of them are young mothers,\u201d Bade said. \u201cThey are putting nursing stations around the Capitol. They are talking about putting diaper-changing stations in lawmaker bathrooms. They\u2019re basically doing a reassessment to make sure it is a friendly work environment for mothers.\u201d All those young mothers and millennial men entering Congress will have another impact too: They\u2019ll drag the average age of the next Congress down by a decade. The midterms are over, but don\u2019t expect Trump to stay off the campaign trail for too long, reports The Washington Post\u2019s Josh Dawsey. \u201cThey\u2019re already eyeing places to go in January, and they have $106 million or so in the bank,\u201d Dawsey said. \u201cThe President was looking at his numbers in all these districts he was campaigning in, comparing them to 2016, trying to come up with a schedule for 2020 events that would benefit him.\u201d And from CNN chief national correspondent John King: You can get to 40 names, even more, if you jot down a list of Democrats who are going to spend time in the next weeks and months deciding whether they want to run for President and whether they could do what it takes to mount a credible effort. But how many Republicans are having that same conversation? The big 2018 midterm shifts do expose serious demographic issues for Trump and his party as we move from 2018 into the early days of the 2020 cycle. But for all the GOP\u2019s problems, base loyalty to the President is not among them \u2013 so any potential GOP challenger understands it is the steepest of hills. At least based on everything we know today. Some Republicans say it is a fight that must be fought, regardless of the odds. Retiring Sen. Jeff Flake of Arizona is in this camp. He told Politico on Friday that he hasn\u2019t ruled out a 2020 challenge but said there are others who would be good candidates, too. One of those he mentioned is Ohio Gov. John Kasich, who is the first potential Trump challenger due to pop up in one of the early states on the 2020 nomination map. Kasich is due in New Hampshire on Thursday to speak at a dinner honoring the First Amendment and a free press. The irony there is obvious given Trump\u2019s constant attacks on the media. In a brief conversation the other day, it was clear Kasich was reviewing the 2018 results in fine detail; he had informed observations about big shifts in the suburbs toward the Democrats and about deep-red areas dominated by working-class white voters. As for the New Hampshire visit, Kasich says he is keeping a commitment made well in advance of the midterm vote and that it is far too early to talk definitively about 2020. But the visit will get him some attention and allow him to spend time with loyal veterans of his unsuccessful 2016 primary run to get a sense of the Granite State landscape now.",

            "article_content": "Both President Donald Trump and Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi spoke Wednesday about their desire to work across the aisle on bipartisan policy initiatives in the new Congress. But with the country more deeply divided than ever along partisan lines, it\u2019s likely that gridlock, rather than cooperation, will be the dominant theme of the next two years with Democrats newly in control of the House pitted against the Republican-held Senate. Here\u2019s how five key domestic policy questions are expected to play out in a divided Washington: Trump promised middle class tax cuts in the days before the election. The big question now is whether he might be able to get Democrats, who bitterly opposed the 2017 tax reform bill that included hefty cuts for corporations and the wealthy, to join in. The President on Wednesday opened the door to working with Democrats if they come up with an idea to help cut taxes for the middle class even if it means potentially raising the corporate tax rate \u2013 now set at 21%. \u201cI would absolutely pursue something even if that means some adjustment to make it possible,\u201d Trump said at a press conference, without defining specifically how much of a calibration he\u2019d be willing to make. When asked, he clarified it as \u201ca little bit of an adjustment.\u201d But Democratic Texas Rep. Lloyd Doggett, a senior member of the tax-writing House Ways and Means Committee, cast doubt Wednesday on the President\u2019s pitch that an adjustment would provide sufficient relief to the middle class. And Democrats have pledged they will adhere to a strict policy of pay-as-you-go on new policy measures to avoid adding to a ballooning national debt. Alternatively, Trump could focus on finding small fixes that even Democrats would go along with, but that he could still claim count as a tax cut \u2013 even if they\u2019re nowhere near the 10% he promised last month, seemingly out of nowhere. That includes maneuvers that would raise tax-free contribution levels for retirement plans or health savings accounts, both steps that have been included in bipartisan legislation introduced this year. A more likely scenario would be making small tax changes \u2013 such the paid family leave credit \u2013 through a budget bill later this year, allowing Republican leaders to use the House-Senate reconciliation process to sneak additional tax cuts in. \u201cThe only strategic move for them is to go through the budget process, which only requires 51 votes,\u201d said Grover Norquist, president of Americans for Tax Reform. \u201cIt\u2019s a rather aggressive play, but it\u2019s perfectly fine to do and strategically wise.\u201d Health care took center stage in the midterm elections, so it\u2019s expected Congress will look to tackle perennially thorny issues such as drug prices and health insurance over the next year as both parties look ahead to the next election cycle. One area where there might be action: Drug prices. Democrats and Republicans agree that prices are too high. Both Trump and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, who is expected to become speaker in January, mentioned drug prices in remarks immediately after the election. \u201cI think that we could find common ground in reducing the cost of prescription drugs, if the President is serious about his saying that he wants to do that. He has pulled his punch on it so far,\u201d Pelosi said on PBS Monday night. But the two parties have different ideas of how to combat the problem. Republicans favor boosting competition and increase price transparency, said Dan Mendelson, founder of Avalere Health, a consulting firm. Democrats, on the other hand, will focus on pressuring drug makers to reduce their prices if they take over one or both chambers. \u201cDemocrats are not shy about digging into pricing,\u201d Mendelson said. When it comes to health insurance, Democratic House lawmakers are also expected to introduce bills that would expand Medicare to cover more Americans. There are various versions of this single-payer legislation floating around, though Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders\u2019 Medicare-for-all bill that he rolled out last fall is the most prominent. But Trump would almost certainly veto any version of the legislation, which he\u2019s equated with socialism. First up is passing the farm bill. The House and the Senate each approved a version, but the effort remains mired in conference committee. One big sticking point: The current Republican-backed House bill would require more food stamp recipients to work, while the Senate wouldn\u2019t. Republicans are likely to push to approve a compromise bill before the party hands over the baton. Democratic Rep. Collin Peterson, ranking member of the House Agriculture Committee, told reporters Wednesday that he would focus on passing the legislation during the lame-duck session, according to Reuters. After that, Democrats may look to increase funding for affordable housing, child care and job training, said Melissa Boteach, senior vice president of the Poverty to Prosperity Program at the left-leaning Center for American Progress. Looming over any legislation is the growing federal deficit, which Republicans have renewed interest in. There will be a strong push to find ways to pay for any changes, said Robert Doar, a fellow in poverty studies at the conservative American Enterprise Institute. Republicans will point to the strong economy and low unemployment rate as justification for adding work requirements to more programs. Trump and his Canadian and Mexican counterparts are due to sign a replacement for the North American Free Trade Agreement \u2013 known as the US-Mexico-Canada Agreement, or USMCA \u2013 in late November, before the Mexican presidency changes hands. But Congress still needs to ratify the agreement \u2013 and legislative procedure makes it almost impossible for them to vote on it before the end of the year unless majorities in both chambers are willing to alter the requirements laid out by the fast-track authority that applies to trade deals. While Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley said in early October that Republicans would try to push it through during the lame duck session, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has knocked down the idea. He told Bloomberg News that the bill won\u2019t come up before the end of the year. Even under the current rules, it\u2019s possible that Congress could skip some steps and vote as early as New Year\u2019s Eve. But that would mean lawmakers would have to vote on the legislation on the very day Trump sends it to Congress, without any time for the committee meetings that would normally take place. It would also likely mean that Congress would vote on the agreement before an economic impact study is published by the US International Trade Commission \u2013 which has up to 105 days to complete it after Trump signs the deal. \u201cI don\u2019t see how procedurally, or politically, they can pull off a lame duck vote on NAFTA 2.0.\u201d said Lori Wallach, the director of Public Citizen\u2019s Global Trade Watch, a consumer advocacy group, and author of a book on the fast-tack authority. And Trump\u2019s own negotiators have already expressed hope that Democrats would get on board with his deal, in part due to improved labor standards and environmental protections that have been worked in. He might have an ally in Massachusetts Democratic Rep. Richard Neal, who\u2019s set to take over the House Ways in Means Committee next year. Neal, who voted against the original NAFTA, has said that \u201cthe bar for supporting a new NAFTA will be high\u201d and that Democrats will prioritize making sure Congress can enforce new standards on environmental protections and worker rights included in the deal. The Constitution gives authority over trade to Congress, but over the years it has delegated some of that power to the president \u2013 which is how Trump has been able to unilaterally impose tariffs on steel and aluminum imports. The next Congress could attempt to slow Trump\u2019s protectionist trade policies, which are hurting some steel and aluminum manufacturers as well as farmers, a key constituency for both parties. Republican lawmakers have already attempted, though unsuccessfully, to take some of this power back. Legislation introduced in June by Tennessee Republican Sen. Bob Corker would limit the President\u2019s power to impose tariffs in the interest of national security \u2013 which Trump invoked to put duties on steel and aluminum imports. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has said he would not bring the bill up for a vote. Even Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown, whose state of Ohio is home to some steel producers, strongly opposed the measure. Even if a bill passed both chambers, Trump would have the opportunity to veto it. There has been less talk of revoking the President\u2019s power to impose tariffs on countries that engage in unfair trade practices, which Trump used to put duties on $250 billion in Chinese goods. Both Democrats and Republicans share concern over China\u2019s alleged intellectual property theft and forced technology transfers. Democrats in the House have already called for more oversight over Trump\u2019s tariffs, the Republicans blocked a resolution of inquiry seeking information from the Trump administration about what is guiding its trade policy has been introduced by New Jersey Rep. Bill Pascrell, who called the President \u201cchaotic\u201d and \u201cincreasingly volatile.\u201d",

            "article_content": "President Donald Trump, his three eldest children and his company are accused in a class action lawsuit filed Monday in Manhattan federal court of using their brand to make millions by coaxing unsophisticated investors to participate in fraudulent schemes. Filed on behalf of four anonymous individuals, the lawsuit accuses the President and his children Eric, Donald Jr. and Ivanka Trump of promoting what they described as promising business opportunities with three companies in exchange for \u201csecret\u201d payments: ACN Opportunity, a telecommunications marketing company; the Trump Network, a vitamin and health product marketing company; and the Trump Institute, a seminar program that \u201cpurported to sell Trump\u2019s \u2018secrets to success.\u2019 \u201c The suit claims that the Trumps in fact \u201cdeliberately misled\u201d consumers about the likely success of their investments. The 160-page lawsuit further claims the Trumps engaged in \u201ca pattern of racketeering activity\u201d and \u201cwere aware that the vast majority of consumers would lose whatever money they invested in the business opportunities and training programs\u201d offered by the three companies. None of the three companies is named as a defendant. The lawsuit is being funded by a nonprofit with ties to Democratic candidates, the Tesseract Research Center, according to a spokesman for the law firm Kaplan, Hecker & Fink. A partner in that firm, Roberta Kaplan, as well as Andrew G. Celli Jr., of Emery, Celli, Brinckerhoff & Abady, are representing the plaintiffs. In response to the suit, a lawyer for the Trump Organization, Alan Garten, said the case was \u201ccompletely meritless\u201d and seized on the Democratic affiliations of Tesseract and the plaintiff\u2019s lawyers. \u201cThis is clearly just another effort by opponents of the President to use the court system to advance a political agenda,\u201d Garten said in a statement. He also noted the timing of the suit heading into the midterm elections on November 6, adding: \u201cThe motivations here are as plain as day.\u201d A spokesman for the plaintiffs\u2019 legal team said the case was filed Monday \u201cbecause it is ready now.\u201d \u201cWe did a thorough investigation and a lot of legal research, and the plaintiffs are eager to file,\u201d he added. \u201cNo matter when this was filed, the Trump Org would say it was politically motivated.\u201d Trump has faced similar allegations of fraud before, most notably in three lawsuits brought against Trump University, his now-defunct real estate seminar that purported to reveal his business secrets to students. Trump agreed to settle those lawsuits, which alleged the program featured false advertisements and never delivered on its claims, for $25 million just days after the 2016 presidential election. The new lawsuit filed Monday contends that, as in the Trump University case, the Trump brand and the apparent endorsement from Trump himself were critical in luring unsuspecting investors to the sham companies he promoted. \u201cIndeed, for the working people who fell prey to the Investments, the Trump endorsement was typically the first thing they learned about the Investments, the reason they took an interest, and the determining factor in their decision to invest,\u201d the lawsuit says. For example, in the case of a plaintiff identified only as \u201cLuke Loe,\u201d Trump\u2019s appearance in a promotional video shown to prospective ACN participants sealed the deal for Loe as a \u201cgood moneymaking opportunity,\u201d court filings say. At the time, in 2014, Loe was homeless and working for the Salvation Army, and unable to afford the $499 ACN registration fee. But, based on Trump\u2019s endorsement, the filings say, Loe took a $499 loan from a friend to join ACN, then attended 25 to 30 meetings, each costing $10 to $20. After months of sinking money into the company, including to attend a national convention in Cleveland, where he watched Trump appear again via videotape, Loe realized he\u2019d had enough, and quit ACN. \u201d \u2018Trust me,\u2019 Trump often said in endorsing and promoting the Investments,\u201d the lawsuit adds. \u201cUnfortunately, far too many victims did.\u201d",

            "article_content": "President Donald Trump outlined a plan Thursday to revamp how Medicare pays for certain pricey drugs, a step that comes as Republicans seek to bolster their standing with voters on health care in the days before the midterm elections. Under the proposal, Medicare would set the reimbursement level for certain drugs administered in doctors\u2019 offices and hospital outpatient centers based on their cost in other countries, which typically pay far less. The so-called \u201ctarget price\u201d of these drugs, which include treatments for cancer, would be 126% of the average of what other countries pay. The announcement, which Trump teased at a Wisconsin rally late Wednesday \u2013 \u201cvery soon, drug prices will go plunging downward\u201d \u2013 came as the President is working to mobilize his loyal Republican base ahead of the midterms by revisiting his 2016 promises to un-rig the US economy. Trump has made lowering drug prices a central promise of his presidency. In his remarks Thursday, he combined that with a swipe at foreign trade practices, framing the Medicare proposal as a way to restore fairness for American healthcare consumers. \u201cThe American middle class is effectively funding virtually all drug research and development for the entire planet,\u201d Trump said. \u201cWe will no longer accept the inflated prices being charged to our seniors. At long last, the drug companies and foreign countries will be held accountable for how they rigged the system against American consumers.\u201d The proposal is likely to run into major resistance from drug companies, as well as doctors, hospitals and some patient advocacy groups. Such blowback has doomed prior administrations\u2019 attempts to control Medicare payments. Pharmaceutical manufacturers charge 1.8 times more in the US than in other countries for drugs that fall under Medicare Part B, which are also used to treat conditions such as multiple sclerosis and autoimmune disorders, according to a Health and Human Services Department report released earlier Thursday. Along with setting reimbursement levels, the proposal would remove from the process hospitals and providers, many of whom now buy the medications at a discount and then bill Medicare. Instead, private vendors would negotiate with drug companies on their behalf and then bill the federal government. The administration is also seeking to change how doctors are reimbursed for administering the drugs, reducing their incentives to select high-priced options. It could pay them a flat fee, instead of the current system of providing a percentage of the medication\u2019s cost. This International Pricing Index model, which would be phased in over five years and take effect in half the nation, would save $17.2 billion for patients and taxpayers, the agency said. Patients alone would see their out-of-pocket costs drop by $3.4 billion. Some experts said this policy \u2013 if it\u2019s implemented \u2013 could have a big impact on drug prices. The US can push drug companies to accept lower prices by the sheer size of its Medicare enrollment, said Rena Conti, associate professor for markets, public policy and law at Boston University. \u201cThis is a huge policy change and one that has great potential to reduce the prices that taxpayers for these drugs and Medicare beneficiaries pay for these drugs,\u201d she said. \u201cIt really changes business as usual for a lot of institutions that make money off of high prices of drugs.\u201d The President\u2019s message on drug prices illustrates the complicated relationship the party has with health care policy. On the one hand, Trump continues to tweet about how his administration and party have fought to help people with pre-existing conditions and how he will hold those in his party accountable if the seek to roll back those protections. The real reason Trump is talking about pre-existing conditions But the administration has in fact been supportive or actively engaged in efforts that could affect people with pre-existing conditions \u2013 from repeated attempts to roll back Obamacare to efforts at the agency level to loosen regulations that provide ironclad protections for consumers who are or have been sick. Also, Trump\u2019s Justice Department is seeking to invalidate the health reform law\u2019s provisions governing pre-existing conditions as part of lawsuit being brought by 20 Republican states. After nearly a decade of promises to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, Republicans have struggled to message health care on the campaign trail. Democrats have attacked the party for gutting protections for people with pre-existing conditions. In fact, Democrats \u2013 after years of being on defense on Obamacare \u2013 have made healthcare a centerpiece of their midterm campaign strategy. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to take the Trump administration and Republicans seriously about reducing health care costs for seniors two weeks before the election,\u201d Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said in a statement about the Medicare pricing plan. With less than two weeks to go until Election Day, many Republicans now don\u2019t talk about repealing Obamacare. They talk about bringing down costs. High drug prices have also been a source of anxiety for many Americans. But basing Medicare reimbursement on what other countries pay would be a huge departure from how the program currently works \u2013 and run counter to Republicans\u2019 allegiance to the free market system. \u201cThis is price fixing. This is setting the rates based upon international standards,\u201d said Gerard Anderson, a health policy professor at Johns Hopkins University. \u201cIt couldn\u2019t be more anti-Republican.\u201d Already, the pharmaceutical industry lobbying group came out swinging. \u201cThe administration is imposing foreign price controls from countries with socialized health care systems that deny their citizens access and discourage innovation,\u201d said Stephen Ubl, CEO of the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America (PhRMA). \u201cThe United States has a competitive marketplace that controls costs and provides patients with access to innovative medicines far earlier than in countries with price controls, and it\u2019s why we lead the world in drug discovery and development.\u201d Another concern: The federal government\u2019s negotiating power is more limited when it comes to Part B drugs because Medicare cannot exclude medications. Previous administrations have resisted the idea of restricting Americans\u2019 access to drugs or treatments, which is more common in other countries\u2019 national health care systems. While Trump officials could use an Obamacare-created innovation center to pilot new payment proposals, it would have to take a hard stance on prices. \u201cWe don\u2019t negotiate because we don\u2019t use the threat of walking away and other countries do,\u201d said Rachel Sachs, an associate professor of law at Washington University. The Trump administration released a 44-page blueprint in May that laid out his vision for increasing competition and changing the incentives for the industry. Trump at the time also blasted foreign governments that \u201cextort unreasonably low prices\u201d from manufacturers, saying \u201cit\u2019s unfair and it\u2019s ridiculous, and it\u2019s not going to happen any longer.\u201d Trump signs bills aimed at increasing drug price transparency Earlier this month, he signed bills ending the so-called gag-order on pharmacists, which prevent them from discussing cheaper options with customers. And Azar also announced a proposal requiring manufacturers to include the list price of any drug paid for by Medicare or Medicaid in television ads. The administration has also unveiled several plans seeking to curb the cost of Part B drugs, which can be among the highest-priced medicines, in recent months. Overall, however, many industry experts say that most of the efforts merely tinker around the edges of the nation\u2019s problem of high-cost drugs. They don\u2019t get at the root cause \u2013 the prices that manufacturers charge.",

            "article_content": "President Donald Trump repeated Monday that he plans to offer a new tax cut plan before the midterms, even though no one seems to know what it will look like or how it might get through a Congress that only barely managed to pass his signature plan last year. \u201cWe\u2019re putting in a resolution sometime in the next week-and-a-half or two weeks,\u201d Trump told reporters on his way to a campaign rally in Houston for Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz, his latest stop in a nationwide barnstorming tour to keep both chambers of Congress in Republican control. The GOP has tried to make tax cuts and the booming economy a key selling point to voters. The President said the new plan would focus on middle-class Americans, as opposed to businesses, which were one of the main beneficiaries of his first tax cut. \u201cThis is not for business. This is for middle. That\u2019s on top of the tax decrease that we\u2019ve already given,\u201d he added. Yet he acknowledged there would not be time for Congress to vote through new tax cuts before the November 6 vote. \u201cI\u2019m going through Congress. We won\u2019t have time to do the vote. We\u2019ll do the vote later. We\u2019ll do the vote after the election,\u201d he said. That\u2019s after he told reporters on Saturday that Republicans would unveil a new package \u201csometime just prior, I would say, to November.\u201d President Trump's remarkable, misinformation-filled midterms media blitz The president, who didn\u2019t offer any specific details on his proposal over the weekend, left many in Washington befuddled over the surprise remark. \u201cTrump may be getting ahead of himself on this one,\u201d said Kyle Pomerleau, an economist at the Tax Foundation, a non-profit think tank in Washington. Representatives from the Treasury Department and the White House Council of Economic Advisers did not respond to repeated requests for comment by CNN. A spokeswoman for House Speaker Paul Ryan referred questions to the White House. Rob Damschen, a spokesman for Rep. Kevin Brady, chair of the House Ways and Means Committee - the lead taxwriting body in Congress \u2013 referred questions to the White House on details of the president\u2019s remarks. \u201cI can tell you there is continued interest in building on the success of the Tax Cuts and Jobs Act and constantly improving the tax code for hardworking families and America\u2019s small businesses,\u201d Damschen said in a statement. A senior GOP congressional source told CNN that \u201cthere\u2019s no serious plan at the moment\u201d with Congress out of session, but added maybe there is a \u201clittle discussion.\u201d Lindsay Walters, a White House spokeswoman, said the President would like to see yet another tax cut for the middle class as part of the Trump administration\u2019s so-called \u201ctax reform 2.0\u201d plan. The first piece of the second wave of tax change was passed in September by the House, which included making individual tax cuts currently set to expire in 2025 permanent. The Senate has yet to take up the legislative proposal. \u201cAs part of Tax Reform 2.0, the first elements of which were passed the House in September, the President would like to see an additional tax cut of 10% for middle-income families,\u201d Walters said in a statement. The President\u2019s sudden mention of a tax plan echoed Trump\u2019s push in April 2017 to generate a tax cut proposal ahead of his 100th day in office, resulting in the release of a much-criticized one-page outline \u2013 though that summary was later written into the tax bill passed in December. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said in an interview with The New York Times on Sunday that he had been actively working on a plan with Brady, that would be unveiled \u201cshortly.\u201d \u201cThis is specifically focused on the middle class and not beyond that,\u201d Mnuchin said in the interview. He did not offer any further details of what such a tax plan would entail or how it would be paid for. Mnuchin noted that any plan in the works would be \u201cdifferent\u201d than a bill that passed the House in September to make individual tax cuts permanent. A big unknown is how the Trump administration plans to pay for yet another tax cut. Last year\u2019s $1.5 trillion tax cut is anticipated to add $1 trillion to the nation\u2019s deficit. The administration insists that the tax cuts will pay for themselves. Last week, the Treasury Department released figures showing the federal budget deficit grew by 17% in the 2018 fiscal year, to $779 billion. Jason Furman, an economist and professor at Harvard University\u2019s Kennedy School of Government, offered a ballpark estimate following the President\u2019s remarks, suggested a 10% income tax cut might cost nearly $2 trillion over the next decade. The former top economic adviser under President Barack Obama noted, however, the exact details will depend on the details.

            "article_content": "Republicans are looking into implementing an additional tax break for middle-income Americans ahead of the midterm elections, President Donald Trump said on Saturday. Speaking to reporters after a campaign rally in Elko, Nevada, Trump said Republicans Rep. Kevin Brady of Texas and House Speaker Paul Ryan of Wisconsin are working on developing a \u201cmajor tax cut for middle income people\u201d in the coming weeks. \u201cIf we do that, it will be sometime just prior, I would say, to November,\u201d Trump said. It\u2019s unclear what tax proposal Trump was referring to on Saturday, with deep partisan divisions in Congress making it unlikely for a new tax plan to advance following the midterms during the lame duck sessions. Congress is currently out of session ahead of the highly anticipated election, which is set for November 6. Pressure on Republicans continues to mount as they\u2019ll attempt to maintain control of Congress. The Forecast: Republicans could keep the House. Here's how. Additionally, the politics surrounding passing a new tax cut are made more complicated by news this week of the country\u2019s ballooning deficit caused at least in some part by the previous tax cut plan passed by congressional Republicans last year. Trump\u2019s announcement also comes just days after Democratic Sen. Kamala Harris announced legislation aimed at providing tax breaks for low- and middle-income individuals. \u201cWe should put money back into the pockets of American families to address rising costs of childcare, housing, tuition, and other expenses,\u201d Harris previously said in a statement. \u201cOur tax code should reflect our values and instead of more tax breaks for the top 1% and corporations, we should be lifting up millions of American families.\u201d Harris\u2019 plan would give tax credits of up to $6,000 per year for households earning less than $100,000 annually and would offer tax credits up to $3,000 for individuals earning under $50,000 per year. Republicans passed a major tax overhaul last year \u2013 the most expansive reform of the US tax system in more than 30 years. However, critics of the legislation said instead of easing the tax burden on the middle class, it prioritized businesses. Trump acknowledged his landmark tax legislation on Saturday, adding that the new tax plan would not be for businesses. \u201cNot for business at all,\u201d Trump said. \u201cFor middle income people. Now, the last was for middle income and for business, and our business is now coming back because of it.\u201d During his gaggle with reporters on Saturday, Trump also addressed the controversy surrounding the disappearance and death of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, who entered \u2013 but never reemerged \u2013 from the Saudi Arabian consulate in Istanbul, Turkey. The President said he planned to speak with Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman \u201csoon.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ll be speaking to him soon, soon very, could be today but I will be speaking to him. A lot of progress is being made we\u2019ll have an answer by probably Tuesday or so,\u201d Trump told reporters. On Friday, Saudi Arabia claimed the Washington Post columnist died in a fistfight involving more than a dozen Saudi officials at the country\u2019s consulate in Istanbul. This explanation led to widespread skepticism, but Trump said on Friday that the official statement was a \u201cgood first step.\u201d He also acknowledged that some questions were left unanswered, but said he wanted to wait before commenting more on the issue until he had a chance to speak with bin Salman. CNN\u2019s Rachel Ventresca, Euan McKirdy, Sarah Sirgany and Clarissa Ward contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Far away from his native Texas on Saturday, Juli\u00e1n Castro was greeted by a familiar sign from home. A woman who donned a University of Texas at San Antonio T-shirt approached the 44-year-old former mayor of San Antonio. A mother of a UTSA graduate, she beckoned Castro for a photo, throwing up the famous Texan hand sign. \u201cYou know, I have to say, I felt at home coming in, walking in, and there\u2019s a (UTSA) shirt,\u201d Castro said to a jovial crowd of 70 door-knockers that amassed in the front office of the Webster County Democrats\u2019 headquarters to support J.D. Scholten, a candidate for Iowa\u2019s 4th Congressional District. This was the second trip to Iowa since August for Castro, a former housing and urban development secretary in the Obama administration. Officially, it\u2019s one of his many stops across the country to rally Democrats in an effort to flip the House and possibly the Senate back to blue, but Castro\u2019s visit once again stoked speculation that he, too, would join a plethora of politicos thought to become possible 2020 contenders. This month, New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker finished his first swing through the Hawkeye State, and fellow Democratic Sen. Kamala Harris of California is set to make her entrance into the Iowa field this week. Vermont independent Sen. Bernie Sanders, who fell short of the Democratic nomination in 2016, will stump in the state next week. 'Folk are folk:' Cory Booker touts roots in Iowa as 2020 speculation swirls But as with almost every other potential Democratic contender, Castro kept his message trained on 2018 and said he won\u2019t decide on his political future until the midterms are over. \u201cWhat can you say about the last 18 months except than it\u2019s been absolutely crazy, and it does not reflect the values of our country,\u201d Castro said Saturday while stumping for Scholten. \u201cWe have the opportunity to make history and set the country in the right direction. And all of that starts with y\u2019all, and making sure people actually get out there and vote.\u201d Standing 6 feet 6 inches tall, Scholten, who coincidentally says he\u2019s lagging only 6 percentage points behind in a district that has elected his opponent, Republican Rep. Steve King, eight times, urged the canvassers to use their \u201cpent up frustration\u201d from the 2016 presidential election and channel it into votes to push him into office. \u201cThis race is going to come down to razor-thin margins,\u201d Scholten said. \u201cEverything I see out there, everything I see in the polls, everything I see in my gut. it\u2019s going to come down to minimal votes. So that door knock, that engagement with folks. It\u2019s precious.\u201d While supporting Cindy Axne, a candidate in Iowa\u2019s 3rd Congressional District, on Friday, Castro said, \u201cI\u2019m in Iowa helping candidates that are on the 2018 ballot. I\u2019m not going to make a decision about the future until after this election because all of our attention needs to be focused on 2018.\u201d Speaking in 40-degree weather on a gray Iowa day to a crowd of more than 50 volunteers, a coat-less Castro joked how his southern origins left him unprepared for fall in the Midwest. \u201cI\u2019m from Texas, so I apologize, I didn\u2019t even bring a sweater today because it was 80 degrees where I was,\u201d he said. \u201cI was a little bit of a dumb Texan today. I\u2019ll get better, don\u2019t worry.\u201d Sounding like a 2020 contender, Castro introduced himself as a product of a single working-class grandmother, mother and public-school education. \u201cWe felt like we lived our American dream. All of us have our American dream,\u201d Castro said. \u201cWe were able to do that and get the education we had because there were things like Pell grants and Perkins loans, and there was federal work studies. \u2026 This country has been at its greatest when it\u2019s willing to invest in people, no matter what their background is or how much money their folks have or don\u2019t have.\u201d Still, Castro says any decision about plunging into the presidential waters will hinge on his where his family and his country stand. \u201cThis is a big commitment, and if I were to make it, I want to make sure for my family and for me that it makes sense,\u201d Castro said. \u201cI want to get a sense of where the country is in November because I believe these elections set a mood, set a tone for the next four years.\u201d",

            "article_content": "President Donald Trump is in the midst of a final push for Republicans ahead of the 2018 midterm elections, which are just 34 days away. That tour took him to Mississippi on Tuesday night, as he stumped for appointed Sen. Cindy Hyde-Smith. Just hours before Trump took the stage, The New York Times published a bombshell report laying out in stark terms that a) Trump and his father, Fred, had actively worked to evade tax law to enrich themselves and b) his own wealth was heavily dependent on and derived from his father\u2019s wealth. The rally also came amid the FBI\u2019s supplemental background investigation into Trump\u2019s Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh. THE POINT -- NOW ON YOUTUBE! \nIn each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe! Those twin pressures seemed to add up to a toxic mix, as Trump spent more than an hour savaging Christine Blasey Ford, who has accused Kavanaugh of sexual assault, the media, Democrats and anyone else he could think of. It was quite a performance \u2013 and not one that sat well with the likes of Sens. Jeff Flake, R-Arizona, Lisa Murkowski, R-Alaska and Susan Collins R-Maine, the swing votes on whether Kavanaugh will be confirmed at the end of this week. I went through the transcript and pulled out the most wild, wacky and woe-is-me lines. They\u2019re below. 1. \u201cWell, I have to start by saying that 2020 is looking really easy, isn\u2019t it?\u201d And away we go! 2. \u201cIn less than two years, we\u2019ve achieved the biggest comeback in American history. That\u2019s what\u2019s happened.\u201d The biggest comeback on what front? Economically? Internationally? Diplomatically? The US Men\u2019s National Soccer team? Who knows! Just take his word for it. Biggest ever. 3. \u201cAnd more Americans are working today than ever before. Today \u2013 ever before.\u201d True! Also, kind of pointless. There are more Americans working than ever before because, well, there are more Americans than ever before. According to The Washington Post\u2019s Fact Checker, this claim \u201cmight go down as one of the more ridiculous economic claims made by the administration.\u201d 4. \u201cWe\u2019re calling it USMCA. You\u2019re going to like that name. That\u2019ll become a part of your vocabulary. USMCA.\u201d This line \u2013 in which Trump is talking about how he renegotiated and renamed NAFTA \u2013 is a good reminder of how he is, at root, a brander and marketer. \u201cNAFTA\u201d was a bad name because it didn\u2019t make clear how America was the prime mover in it. USMCA \u2013 \u201cUnited States-Mexico-Canada\u201d \u2013 is way better. 5. \u201cAmerica is winning again, and America is being respected again, maybe respected like never before, because we are finally putting America first.\u201d [Pulls out trusty Respect-O-Meter, checks readings] Yeah, this checks out. 6. \u201cI\u2019m not on the ballot, but in a certain way, I\u2019m on the ballot.\u201d He\u2019s talking about the 2018 midterms \u2013 and correct! But that is not good news for Republicans. In all but three midterm elections since the end of the Civil War, the president\u2019s party has lost seats in the House. 7. \u201cThe only reason to vote Democrat is if you are tired of winning.\u201d And who could be sick of that??? Losers, that\u2019s who. 8. \u201cYou can really get your wife to like you a lot when that happens.\u201d Trump is referring to the fact that 401(k) values have gone up during his presidency. So, yes, he is suggesting that a sure-fire way to a woman\u2019s heart is by making your retirement accounts more valuable. 9. \u201cThe Democrats \u2013 and I say this \u2013 and I\u2019ve dealt with it \u2013 the Democrats are the party of crime.\u201d This feels like a slight oversimplification. Maybe it\u2019s just me. 10. \u201cNo one under any circumstances is allowed to speak up if you\u2019re on this side of the equation.\u201d This sentiment, vague as it is, is the beating heart of Trumpism. His candidacy \u2013 and presidency \u2013 is a reaction to political correctness, liberal shaming and the idea that conservatives need to shut up and sit down. He took that boiling cauldron of anger and resentment and turned it into political jet fuel. 11. \u201cAnd first in his class at Yale. Top, top in his class at Yale Law School.\u201d Kavanaugh was neither of these things. Neither Yale nor Yale Law School, which Kavanaugh attended, calculate class rank. Kavanaugh graduated cum laude from Yale as an undergrad. 12. \u201cWhat he\u2019s going through: 36 years ago, this happened. \u2018I had one beer.\u2019 Right? \u2018I had one beer.\u2019 \u2018Well, you think it was \u2026\u2019 \u2018Nope, it was one beer.\u2019 \u2018Oh, good. How did you get home?\u2019 \u2018I don\u2019t remember.\u2019 \u2018How did you get there?\u2019 \u2018I don\u2019t remember.\u2019 \u2018Where is the place?\u2019 \u2018I don\u2019t remember.\u2019 \u2018How many years ago was it?\u2019 \u2018I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know.\u2019\u201d No one should be shocked that Trump is mocking Ford\u2019s emotional recounting of a sexual assault in her teen years that she alleges was committed by Kavanaugh. We shouldn\u2019t even be shocked that lots and lots of people in the crowd laughed at Trump\u2019s \u201cimpersonation.\u201d But what we should remember is that this isn\u2019t normal presidential behavior. Or, really, acceptable human behavior. 13. \u201cThey want to destroy people. These are really evil people.\u201d It\u2019s not clear to me who the \u201cthey\u201d is in Trump\u2019s accusations. Is it Democrats? If so, what evidence is there that Senate Democrats had any role at all in Ford\u2019s allegations? If it\u2019s Ford (and the other accusers of Kavanaugh), well, then that\u2019s a whole other \u2013 and darker \u2013 thing. 14. \u201cDa Nang Richard Blumenthal\u201d This is the start of an extended riff by Trump attacking Connecticut Sen. Richard Blumenthal for lying about whether or not he had actually served in Vietnam during the war. Blumenthal, who was never in Vietnam during his time as a member of the Marine Corps Reserves, was forced to apologize. This happened in 2010. 15. \u201cAnd then he cried. When they caught him, he cried like a baby. Like a baby.\u201d Not much is a bigger indictment of you as a man in the eyes of Trump than if you cry. It shows weakness. It\u2019s un-manly. One wonders, then, what Trump thought of Kavanuagh\u2019s tear-filled opening statement to the Senate Judiciary Committee last week. 16. \u201cAnd the reason he got elected is because in Connecticut it\u2019s impossible for a Republican to get elected.\u201d [whispers] From 1995 through 2011, Connecticut had Republican governors. 17. \u201cWe had another woman just reported by a sleazebag lawyer named Aviante. Sleazebag. Sleazebag.\u201d Who is this \u201cAviante Sleazabag\u201d? Sounds like a bad dude! 18. \u201cI\u2019ve had many false accusations. I\u2019ve had it all the \u2013 I\u2019ve had so many \u2013 and when I say it didn\u2019t happen, nobody believes me.\u201d Reminder: During the course of the 2016, more than a dozen women came forward to say Trump acted inappropriately with them, sexually assaulted them or carried on affairs with them. Trump denied all of the allegations and pledged to sue each and every one of the women for defamation once the election ended. None of those lawsuits have been filed. 19. \u201cYou know, I\u2019m listening to commentators, and they say, \u2018If Trump were running, he\u2019s going to beat everybody.\u2019 They\u2019re saying that. You know, it\u2019s hard for them to admit that.\u201d I\u2019m not sure where Trump is getting this quote although it\u2019s almost certainly from cable TV \u2013 if it actually exists at all. And for what it\u2019s worth: I think he has a real chance of winning a second term in 2020, but I wouldn\u2019t make a prediction that he is going to win based on his not-so-great poll numbers at the moment. 20. \u201cYou know, with Biden, you go like this \u2013 whew \u2013 and he goes down.\u201d No big deal! Just the President of the United States saying he would knock out the former vice president of the United States with one punch! 21. \u201cAnd they say if I was on the ticket, everybody would go, it would be a landslide. Even the fakers back there, they say that.\u201d [narrator voice] \u201cThey\u201d didn\u2019t say that. 22. \u201cWe\u2019ll be on the ballot in two years, and we will do a landslide like you haven\u2019t \u2013 like you wouldn\u2019t believe.\u201d The biggest landslide. You\u2019ll be amazed by the size of it. Believe me. 23. \u201cNobody has accomplished more in two years.\u201d This is almost certainly inaccurate. (If you assume \u201cmost accomplishments\u201d can be accurately measured.) 24. \u201cYou think this is a big crowd in here? This place is packed, right? Right.\u201d Trump is obsessed with crowd size because he believes it is a direct indicator of just how popular he is. Which is why he had then-White House press secretary Sean Spicer make the false claim that his inaugural crowd was the biggest ever. (It wasn\u2019t.) 25. \u201cBecause we don\u2019t need much of a stage. Basketball, they need a big \u2013 you\u2019re filled up with people, like it is tonight.\u201d [takes out notepad] Basketball, right. [scratches head, blinks repeatedly, stares blankly into space] 26. \u201cAnd that kind of dishonesty happens all the time. Happened at the inauguration. It happened at the inauguration.\u201d He\u2019s suggesting \u2013 STILL \u2013 that his inauguration crowd was bigger than it was reported!!!! (It wasn\u2019t.) It\u2019s October 2, 2018! 27. \u201cWe are thrilled to be joined tonight by several great Republican leaders.\u201d This is the first mention of why Trump is actually in Mississippi. And it comes more than halfway through the speech. 28. \u201cLook at this guy. Is he central casting or what? Is he \u2013 look at this. He\u2019s central casting.\u201d Trump\u2019s referring to Mississippi Gov. Phil Bryant \u2013 and, in so doing, reminding us all that looking the part is essential to doing the job in his mind. 29. \u201cThese are warriors. Look, the abuse they take, the abuse we all take, if you\u2019re not a warrior, you just go home, go to the corner, put your thumb in your mouth and say, \u2018Mommy, take me home.\u2019\u201d Donald Trump on politicians. And crying. And warriors? 30. \u201cHe\u2019s jumping around. The hair\u2019s going crazy. The hair\u2019s going crazy.\u201d Donald Trump has some thoughts on Bernie Sanders\u2019 hair. Which is totally fine and not at all ironic. 31. \u201cYou know, he\u2019s out there. He\u2019s doing his thing, whether you like it or not. He\u2019s out there doing his thing, and you\u2019ve got to hand it to him.\u201d What\u2019s interesting is that, I think, Trump sort of likes Sanders. They agree on almost nothing, but Trump admires his passion and spunk. 32. \u201cPatrick Leahy \u2013 oh, he\u2019s never had a drink in his life. Check it out. Look under \u2018Patrick Leahy/drink.\u2019\u201d Just the President of the United States suggesting a Democratic senator has a drinking problem. Totally normal stuff! 33. \u201cHave to do it. We have to do it. We have to do it, and we want to do it. I want to do it. We\u2019re all going to do it.\u201d What is Trump talking about here? Would you believe insurance companies covering pre-existing conditions? 34. \u201cWe\u2019re building the wall. It\u2019s going up.\u201d So, the thing is \u2026 35. \u201cThey\u2019re going to take your wealth away from you. They\u2019re going to take your wealth away.\u201d So, if Democrats win the House, you will be poor. Case closed. 36. \u201cWe don\u2019t have a magic wand.\u201d [Crosses Trump off running list of \u201cpeople who might possess magic wands\u201d] 37. \u201cWe need a real majority, and we\u2019re going to do everything that you\u2019ve been looking for a long time. You know, with that being said, we\u2019ve done so much. We\u2019ve done so much.\u201d In back-to-back sentences, Trump argues that if they had larger House and Senate majorities, then they could really get things done and then that they have already done so much. Sure! 38. \u201cI love you, too. You\u2019re not my type, but I love you.\u201d This was in response to a man\u2019s yell from the crowd. I\u2019ll just leave this here. 39. \u201cBeautiful accent. I wish I had his accent. I would have been president 15 years ago if I had his accent.\u201d The President is admiring the accent of Jean-Claude Juncker, the head of the European Union. (Not Jean-Claude Van Damme.) And, yes, Trump he did an impersonation of Juncker, who is a Luxembourger. Which is really what you call Luxembourg natives. Which is terrific. 40. \u201cDo you know how wealthy our country would be if they didn\u2019t have these really stupid deals all over the place, so many of them?\u201d [tentatively raises hand] Um, very wealthy? 41. \u201cThe Space Force. And that\u2019s what it\u2019s all about, folks. You look at what\u2019s happening. I\u2019m not just talking rockets to the moon and to Mars. I\u2019m talking about defense. I\u2019m talking about \u2013 that\u2019s where it is. It\u2019s in space.\u201d The Space Force. It\u2019s a force. In space. SPACE FORCE. 42. \u201cNow, who knows, folks? Who knows?\u201d This feels like a good place to end.",

            "article_content": "Converging crises are compounding the risk that Republicans could suffer historic 2018 losses in suburban communities that could harden a starkly polarized alignment in American politics. Precisely as sexual abuse allegations against Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh threaten to deepen the GOP\u2019s already cavernous deficit with well-educated white women, the chaos that erupted with Monday\u2019s uncertainty about the fate of Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein appears likely to compound the concerns of independent voters who want Congress to provide more of a check on President Donald Trump. Even before these developments, Republicans faced a perilous environment in white-collar suburbs rooted in discontent among college-educated white voters, especially women, over Trump\u2019s tempestuous style, belligerent language and portions of his agenda. Both the Kavanaugh controversy and the Rosenstein speculation could reinforce two of the central sources of that suburban anxiety: concerns that Trump does not respect either women or the rule of law. The GOP is right to be worried about Kavanaugh Yet national polls and surveys in the key state and House district battlegrounds offer much less evidence that all of these forces are meaningfully eroding Trump\u2019s support with the groups that keyed his 2016 election: particularly blue-collar, evangelical and rural whites. That stark divergence means those watching the electoral shoreline for signs of a \u201cblue wave\u201d in November may be looking in the wrong place. Rather than a wave washing equally over all parts of the country, the 2018 election now appears more likely to produce a targeted current that widens the nation\u2019s existing geographic and demographic divisions, like a river cutting through rock. \u201cJust like in 2016, we are seeing voters shifting in opposite directions, which is not something you usually see,\u201d says Emory University political scientist Alan Abramowitz. \u201cIt\u2019s not the normal pattern. The normal pattern you see is that everyone shifts in the same direction to varying degrees and usually the differences in the size of the shift are not all that great. In this case, we\u2019re seeing really big differences and voters going in opposing directions.\u201d In practice, this disparate reaction to Trump and the Republican Congress that has locked arms around him is creating a two-tier battlefield for control of the House of Representatives. Six weeks before Election Day, Democrats are increasingly confident about their prospects in a wide range of mostly white-collar suburban districts from coast to coast, including several in more traditionally Republican leaning metropolitan areas; the Democrats\u2019 list of targeted districts on this terrain is actually expanding as the election approaches. By contrast, the party\u2019s opportunities in blue-collar and small-town districts appear to be stalled or even receding. Given Trump\u2019s continued strength with working-class whites, Democrats were targeting far fewer of these seats to begin with. But now, with a few prominent exceptions such as a northeast Iowa district where Democrat Abby Finkenauer has established a dominant lead over Republican Rep. Rob Blum, many of those challenges have failed to gain traction. A Republican stronghold has become ground zero in 2018 If this pattern persists through Election Day, it would widen the trench between major metropolitan areas increasingly dominated by Democrats and less densely populated areas beyond them where Republicans still rule. \u201cIf you look back over 20 years, these alignments are very pronounced, as the Republican base has migrated from the country club to the country,\u201d says Tom Davis, a former Republican representative who served as chair of the National Republican Congressional Committee. \u201cThis is entirely consistent with a 20-year movement that Trump is putting an exclamation point on.\u201d The chance that November\u2019s election will harden this divide rests on the atypical pattern that Abramowitz highlighted: while some groups are clearly recoiling from the President, others are moving little, if at all. That\u2019s a departure from the more consistent movement, especially among white voters, evident in recent mid-term elections. In each of the past three midterm elections, exit polls show that white voters with and without a college education shifted their loyalties in roughly similar proportions. When Democrats captured both chambers of Congress in 2006, for instance, the party consistently improved its share of the vote in House races compared to 2004. It gained by five percentage points among white men without a college degree, six points among white women with and without a college degree and seven points among college-educated white men, exit polls found. There was only modestly more variation during the GOP landslide of 2010. Compared to the results in 2008, the Democratic share of the vote in 2010 House elections declined by nine points among white men without a college degree, eight points among non-college white women, seven points among college-white men, and four points among college-educated white women. During the GOP sweep in 2014, there was even less variation when compared to the results in 2012. Why red and blue states divide over green policy But this time, polls point toward much bigger gaps. Compared to the results of the 2016 exit polls for House races, the latest national CNN Poll conducted by SSRS shows Democrats increasing their share of the vote among white men without a college degree by a modest six points (from just 27% to 33%) but gaining more than twice as much among white men with a college degree (up from 38% in 2016 to 52% now). Likewise, while the poll shows Democrats gaining eight percentage points among white women without a degree (up from 35% to 43% percent), their gains are more than twice as great among white women with such degrees (an unprecedented 67% of whom say they now support Democrats for the House, up from 50% in 2016). Other national polls report slightly different results for these four groups of white voters. But they all generally follow the same pattern, with Republicans maintaining a commanding lead among blue-collar white men, Democrats opening enormous advantages among white-collar white women, and both college-educated men and non-college women dividing closely between the parties. These contrasting responses also emerge from the flurry of district-by-district House polls published in the past few weeks by Monmouth College and The New York Times in partnership with Siena College. Each shows severe vulnerability for Republicans in a wide range of suburban districts located inside major metropolitan areas and containing a large number of college-educated voters. The NYT/Siena polls, for instance, show that a majority of voters disapprove of Trump\u2019s performance in the suburban seats now held by Republican incumbents Steve Knight and Dana Rohrabacher in California; John Culberson and Pete Sessions in Texas; Erik Paulsen in Minnesota; Kevin Yoder in Kansas; Peter Roskam in Illinois; Mike Coffman in Colorado; Carlos Curbelo in Florida and Leonard Lance in New Jersey. Of all the Republicans on that list, only Texans Culberson and Sessions held a clear lead among college-educated white voters, while Roskam and Lance ran about evenly. All the rest trailed among those voters, often by significant margins. And while almost all of those Republican incumbents held substantial leads among non-college white voters in their districts, all either trailed overall or ran only about even with their Democratic opponent and still registered below 50% in support \u2013 either way a precarious position for an incumbent this close to Election Day. (An earlier Monmouth Poll showed Northern Virginia Republican Rep. Barbara Comstock facing the same equation). The polls have returned more encouraging results for both Trump and the GOP in blue-collar districts defined by large numbers of voters without a college degree, usually centered on small town and rural communities outside of major metropolitan areas. These include contests in West Virginia, Wisconsin and Maine. Finkenauer, in the northeastern Iowa district, is the only Democrat holding a convincing lead among non-college whites in any of the seats the NYT/Siena project has polled. In almost all the other contests they have polled, as well as the Monmouth surveys, Democrats still trail by at least double-digits among those voters, who provided the core of Trump\u2019s support in 2016. Political professionals working on the House races dispute some of these individual results, but confirm the general direction of the findings. Democrats still see some plausible opportunities in blue-collar and rural districts, including Finkenauer, the Maine seat now held by Rep. Bruce Poliquin, and the rural New Mexico district that Republican Steve Pearce has vacated to run for governor. But doubts have grown about their prospects in several others that initially appeared stronger opportunities, including the seat House Speaker Paul Ryan is vacating in Wisconsin, two seats in downstate Illinois and the high-profile challenge by former Marine pilot Amy McGrath to Rep. Andy Barr in a district around Lexington. The clearest exception to this pattern is the complex of governor and Senate races in four key Rust Belt states \u2013 Ohio, Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania \u2013 where polls generally show Democrats recovering somewhat among blue-collar whites, especially women. That could be significant for the party\u2019s hopes of beating Trump in 2020. But in 2018, the resistance of blue-collar whites remains a constraint on possible Democratic gains in the House. But while the blue-collar terrain remains rocky, Democratic opportunities seem to be expanding in white-collar seats. Pollsters in both parties say the decline in Trump\u2019s national approval rating evident since Labor Day has reverberated powerfully in those places. With Republicans facing that undertow, Democrats are growing increasingly confident about their chances not only against incumbents long in their sights (such as Knight, Rohrabacher, Yoder and Paulsen) but in districts that were originally on the periphery of their target list, such as seats around Raleigh and Charlotte, the Irvine California-centered seat held by Republican Rep. Mimi Walters and the southeastern Florida seat held by Brian Mast. Seats that combine measurable concentrations of minority voters with white-collar whites, like those in Texas and Orange County, provide Democrats a pathway to victory even if they can\u2019t match the gains they are experiencing among white collar whites in more traditionally Democratic areas. Not all suburban races are moving toward the Democrats \u2013 the party, for instance, is growing gloomy about their prospects against Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick outside Philadelphia and in the Orange County seat vacated by Republican Rep. Ed Royce. But overall, both sides expect Democrats to significantly tighten their control over the remaining Republican-held seats inside the major metropolitan areas, particularly because the allegations of sexual assault against Kavanaugh from professor Christine Blasey Ford could further alienate professional white women already stampeding away from Trump\u2019s definition of the GOP. \u201cEven though this alleged incident was not a workplace incident \u2026 for these professional women it just reinforces that they face these obstacles \u2026 and that this isn\u2019t an administration or a party that cares about professional women,\u201d says Democratic pollster Anna Greenberg. Wave elections usually crest and recede, like the Democratic small-town gains in 2006 that were almost entirely swept away in the Republican tide of 2010. The real risk for the GOP is that the approaching Democratic gains in suburban seats will prove a lasting realignment of partisan loyalties \u2013 like those 2010 Republican gains in rural places. The approaching suburban recoil from the GOP, Davis acknowledges, looks \u201cmore fundamental\u201d than a typical mid-term shift. Democrats, he says, might give Republicans a chance to rebuild if they choose a 2020 presidential candidate who is more liberal than many white-collar suburbanites can stomach. But if Democrats don\u2019t provide such an opening, he says, it won\u2019t be easy for Republicans to recover from the suburban tsunami bearing down on them so long as Trump defines the party. \u201cEven though these folks are benefiting a lot from the Trump economy, it\u2019s just a reaction to his temperament,\u201d Davis says. \u201cThese are just the people saying \u2018we don\u2019t want to leave these guys [in the White House] untethered\u2019 and we need to make a course correction.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum on Tuesday became Florida\u2019s first African-American nominee for governor, as he notched a major victory for progressives in the state and around the country. An early underdog in a crowded field, the 39-year-old upset the Florida political establishment with the support of grass-roots Florida progressives and a coalition of groups like the Collective PAC, which is dedicated to elevating African-American candidates, Indivisible, an organization formed in response to President Donald Trump\u2019s election in 2016, and the Working Families Party. \u201cThe job of the governor of the state of Florida is to do what is in the best interest of the people of the state of Florida,\u201d Gillum said on Tuesday night. \u201cI look forward to being that governor because I know that beneath my name is also a desire by the majority of people in this state to see real criminal justice reform take hold in the state of Florida.\u201d One of seven siblings from a working-class family, Gillum became the mayor of Tallahassee in 2014 after previously being the youngest person elected to its city commission. Last year, he made headlines by defeating the National Rifle Association, which had sued the city over an ordinance that outlawed firearm use in public parks. Bernie-backed progressive Andrew Gillum will face a Trump-styled Republican in Florida's governor's race The victory, he wrote at the time, \u201cmeans the next time (the NRA comes) after another community with a lawsuit, precedent will be on our side, and they\u2019ll have to think twice.\u201d Gillum has called on the man he is hoping to replace, outgoing Republican Gov. Rick Scott, to suspend the state\u2019s controversial \u201cStand Your Ground\u201d gun law, and he supports a ban on assault weapons. He was the only leading Democrat in his primary to endorse \u201cMedicare-for-all\u201d single-payer health care, a top progressive agenda item and the policy most famously championed by Vermont\u2019s independent Sen. Bernie Sanders, who endorsed and campaigned for Gillum in Florida earlier this month. \u201cNo one person can take on the economic and political elites on their own,\u201d Sanders said in a statement after the race was called. \u201cTonight, Floridians joined Andrew in standing up and demanding change in their community. That\u2019s what the political revolution is all about and Andrew Gillum is helping to lead it.\u201d Like Sanders, Gillum has kept his criticism of President Donald Trump at a relative low boil, instead focusing \u2013 while urging others to follow suit \u2013 on issues that could bring new voters out to the polls. \u201cI didn\u2019t talk a whole bunch about Trump as I moved around the state,\u201d Gillum told CNN\u2019s Don Lemon on Tuesday. \u201cWe all know that the President is uniquely unqualified for the position that he holds. He is dangerous to himself and to the country, in my opinion.\u201d What people wanted to know, he added, \u201cis what are you going to do for me and how do you make sure that I can work one job instead of multiple jobs as a way to make ends meet?\u201d In the interview, Gillum played down the historical nature of his win \u2013 and the potential for another milestone in November, when he could become the state\u2019s first African-American governor. But former state Sen. Dwight Bullard, the political director for New Florida Vision PAC, hailed Gillum\u2019s victory in the context of an increasingly diverse progressive movement. \u201cBlack voters, other voters of color, and progressives can claim this victory as theirs,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cTogether, we made history. Gillum\u2019s victory shows that we can no longer be ignored or taken for granted. We\u2019re stepping into the process and we\u2019re demanding more.\u201d",

            "article_content": "It was nearly 2 a.m., a few hours after she felled the 10-term incumbent Rep. Joe Crowley, and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez was tweeting. She thanked the district that backed her, and Crowley, too, for his \u201cservice.\u201d Her win, she said, marked \u201cthe start of a movement\u201d \u2013 one the 28-year-old was in a rush to heat up. \u201cThere are more of us,\u201d she wrote, naming Ayanna Pressley in Massachusetts, Cori Bush in Missouri and Florida\u2019s Chardo Richardson. Like Ocasio-Cortez, each set out to defeat and replace a sitting Democratic House member. The rise of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez happened slowly and then, on the night of June 26, all at once. In less than a month since, she has ridden a wave of support, put her foot in her mouth, been celebrated by fellow democratic socialists, scorned by Republicans and centrist Democrats, questioned \u2013 in good faith and bad \u2013 by pundits of all stripes and touted by admirers as a future party leader. Now she\u2019s out on the campaign trail, with a trip to Michigan next on her itinerary, boosting her allies and trying to put a leftist stamp on the Democratic class of 2018. The road here was long. It traces back to the spring of 2017, when she entered New York\u2019s 14th Congressional District primary as an almost complete unknown. But also to the aftermath of the 2016 presidential election, when a pair of new progressive groups, Brand New Congress and the Justice Democrats, began to recruit her as a potential candidate. Before all that, she worked on Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders\u2019 presidential campaign. During college, she spent time in the late Massachusetts Sen. Ted Kennedy\u2019s office. It began when her father, a South Bronx native, died while she was studying at Boston University, leaving the family hard up \u2013 this was during the financial crisis \u2013 to keep their suburban home. They eventually sold it. Ocasio-Cortez moved back to New York, to the Bronx, after graduation. Her mother, who was born in Puerto Rico, went to Florida, where she could better afford to live. Before becoming a candidate, Ocasio-Cortez was working as a waitress. But for most everyone else \u2013 those who doubted her chances of upsetting Crowley, a rumored successor to House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, or simply didn\u2019t know her name until a little after 9 p.m. ET on June 26 \u2013 the story is much shorter. Only about a month old. On the morning after the primary, a reporter asked Pelosi at a news conference on Capitol Hill if Crowley\u2019s loss was a sign, as some Republicans suggested, that democratic socialism was \u201cascendant\u201d in the party. \u201cIt\u2019s ascendent in that district perhaps,\u201d she said of New York\u2019s 14th. \u201cBut I don\u2019t accept any characterization of our party presented by the Republicans. So let me reject that right now. \u2026 Our party is a big tent. Our districts are very different, one from the other.\u201d Democrats weigh implications of stunning primary upset Of the previous night\u2019s results, Pelosi said (again), \u201cThey made a choice in one district.\u201d Less diplomatic voices noted that in a district of more than 230,000 registered Democrats, only about 28,000 had turned out. The upset of the year had been won, decidedly, but with something like 16,000 votes. While Washington scrambled, debated and rationalized, Ocasio-Cortez was already back at work, making her case. This time, though, the audience was a touch bigger. Over the next few days, she would appear on CNN and a handful of other major mainstream television news outlets. One district\u2019s choice was speaking to a national audience and the initial stir began to feel more like a craze, bringing in previously unthinkable sums of donor dollars \u2013 more than $800,000 now, Ocasio-Cortez communications director Corbin Trent told CNN, since the primary. There she was, on \u201cThe Late Show with Stephen Colbert\u201d just a couple of days after the vote, explaining to the host, to a country, what democratic socialism \u2013 \u201cnot an easy term for a lot of Americans,\u201d he noted \u2014 meant to her. \u201cI believe,\u201d she said, \u201cthat in a modern, moral and wealthy society, no person in America should be too poor to live.\u201d For the American left, which has for so long twisted itself in knots trying to spell out its most basic values, it felt like a watershed moment. A pair of organizers from the Democratic Socialists of America writing in Jacobin, the socialist magazine, a few days later cited the line and lauded her \u201ctransformational vision.\u201d The group had seen a massive surge in dues-paying membership \u2013 its ranks now exceed 45,000, organizers said \u2013 following the primary. But now it was getting a different sort of attention. The decades-old organization, which has enjoyed a steady rise during the Trump era, has become increasingly apt at exercising its electoral muscles. Its chapters have backed primary winners, some of them members, from Virginia (in 2017) to Pennsylvania and, of course, in New York, where Julia Salazar, at 27, is vying to unseat a Democrat in September\u2019s 18th state Senate district primary. By July, Cynthia Nixon, who is challenging New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo from the left and exchanged endorsements with Ocasio-Cortez the day before the federal primary, described herself \u2013 for the first time \u2013 to Politico as a \u201cdemocratic socialist.\u201d In an interview with Jacobin Radio\u2019s \u201cThe Dig\u201d podcast, Nixon was asked by host Daniel Denvir what she made of Pelosi\u2019s assessment, from the day after Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s win, that socialism was not \u201cascendent\u201d among Democrats. \u201cNancy Pelosi is dead wrong,\u201d said Nixon, who has actively sought backing from the Democratic Socialists of America. \u201cThat is exactly what\u2019s happening.\u201d Ocasio-Cortez, meanwhile, had kept up a busy schedule in her district while attending to the media crush. Her support helped shove the movement to \u201cAbolish ICE,\u201d which had for so long been relegated to the progressive fringes, into the national headlines. On June 28, New York\u2019s Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand called for the agency to be eliminated. New York Mayor Bill de Blasio followed suit the next morning, telling WNYC\u2019s Brian Lehrer, \u201cICE\u2019s time has come and gone.\u201d \u201cI think \u2018Abolish ICE\u2019 is where it is today because of her leadership,\u201d activist Sean McElwee told CNN earlier this month, as progressive Rep. Mark Pocan of Wisconsin, along with Reps. Pramila Jayapal of Washington state and New York\u2019s Adriano Espaillat, were working on legislation to end it. The final product, introduced two weeks ago with six cosponsors, is at once a dead-ender in the Republican-controlled House \u2013 a political gift to endangered conservatives, some pundits have argued \u2013 and another signal moment in the rise of the progressive left. At the same time, there was a backlash brewing in the Democratic ranks. Illinois\u2019 Sen. Tammy Duckworth, in an interview with CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper on July 1, warned that Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s politics wouldn\u2019t play in her region. Asked if she thought the party was moving too far left ahead of the midterms and 2020 presidential campaign, Duckworth said: \u201cWell, I think that you can\u2019t win the White House without the Midwest. And I don\u2019t think that you can go too far to the left and still win the Midwest. Coming from a Midwestern state, I think you need to be able to talk to the industrial Midwest. You need to listen to the people there in order to win an election nationwide.\u201d Ocasio-Cortez responded to the headlines that followed in a tweet. \u201cWith respect to the Senator, strong, clear advocacy for working class Americans isn\u2019t just for the Bronx,\u201d she wrote, listing states Sanders won in the 2016 primaries and asking: \u201cWe then lost several of those states in the general. What\u2019s the plan to prevent a repeat?\u201d Even then, Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s standing among even establishment party voices remained solid. On July 3, Valerie Jarrett, who was one of President Barack Obama\u2019s top advisers, cheered the young democratic socialist on social media. But the grumbling in liberal circles was beginning to pick up. The party establishment is pretty openly desperate for a new star, but at what cost \u2013 and what would it mean for its current leaders? Early on July 12, the pressure boiled over. Ocasio-Cortez accused Crowley in a tweet of blowing her off three times ahead of \u201cscheduled concession calls.\u201d Within the hour, Crowley shot back, pinning the missed connections on her staff and declaring, again, that \u201cthe race is over.\u201d Many Democrats were left asking why \u2013 why reignite a fight that seemed done and dusted? \u201cWhen \u2026 you know that you\u2019ve got a candidate (in Crowley) that didn\u2019t really see this coming and this totally changes the trajectory of his future, you worry,\u201d Trent, who also serves as the executive director of Justice Democrats, said at the time. Those concerns were fuled by Crowley\u2019s refusal to give up his place on the Working Families Party ballot line, which he had secured before the primary. (Getting off the ticket is a complicated, convoluted process that a spokesperson said Crowley believed was unethical to take part in, an explanation that roiled Working Families Party leaders, who denied there was anything unusual about it \u2013 something that Crowley would surely know, they said, given his place as the chair of the Queens County Democrats.) Rep. Crowley on primary loss: It's on me Alas, Crowley figures to be on the ballot in November, even as he insists \u2013 as he did again during his first post-primary news conference on Capitol Hill \u2013 that there is no zombie campaign afoot. Still, the lingering dust-up has compounded the resentment and frustration among establishment Democrats, particularly some in Washington, who think Ocasio-Cortez should tap the brakes. \u201cMeteors fizz out,\u201d said Florida\u2019s Rep. Alcee Hastings, who entered Congress around the time Ocasio-Cortez might\u2019ve started preschool. That jab, along with a series of testy reviews from Capitol Hill Democrats featured in a report by The Hill, cast a clear eye on the realities likely to face Ocasio-Cortez next year. Especially if she arrives and continues to push for a House Democratic \u201csub-caucus.\u201d \u201cEven if you can carve out a sub-portion, a sub-caucus of the progressive caucus, even if you could carve out that, even a smaller bloc, but one that operates as a bloc,\u201d she told Denvir on \u201cThe Dig,\u201d \u201cthen you can generate real power.\u201d Then there was the question of her appearance on PBS\u2019s \u201cFiring Line.\u201d During an interview there, Ocasio-Cortez backed a two-state solution in the region and affirmed her support for Israel\u2019s right to exist but also used the term \u201coccupation of Palestine\u201d to describe Israel\u2019s presence in parts of the region. The host, Margaret Hoover, a conservative CNN contributor, hit pause there and asked Ocasio-Cortez to explain her position: Why, exactly, did she call it an \u201coccupation\u201d? \u201cWhat I meant,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez offered haltingly, \u201cis like the settlements that are increasing in some of these areas and places where Palestinians are experiencing difficulty in access to their housing and homes.\u201d Pressed again, she added: \u201cI am not the expert on geopolitics on this issue. For me, I am a firm believer in finding a two-state solution on this issue, and I\u2019m happy to sit down with leaders on both of these. \u2026 For me, I just look at things through a human rights lens, and I may not use the right words. I know this is a very intense issue.\u201d No doubt there. The hits came hard and fast. \u201cOcasio-Cortez Embarrasses Herself on Firing Line,\u201d the National Review announced, while other outlets trumpeted both outrage over the comment and some glee, veiled or not, at her being found wanting. After weeks of mostly gauzy coverage, the backlash felt inevitable. A week ago Monday, Ocasio-Cortez visited the more friendly environs of Democracy Now!, hosted by investigative journalist Amy Goodman. There she began \u2013 or tried \u2013 to contain the fallout, noting that \u201cone of the things I\u2019m pursuing (as she hashes out a clearer position on Israel) is sitting down with lots of activists and sitting down with lots of leaders and figuring out exactly what this position looks like in the progressive movement.\u201d The left has mostly forgiven Ocasio-Cortez her stumble, even as it\u2019s promised to keep a close eye on her position. The trust is there. Conservatives, though, are already using the remarks and her criticism as a wedge between her and Democratic leadership, which tends to be fiercely pro-Israel and, with a few exceptions, loath to condemn its actions in all but the most extreme circumstances. If the tempest seems to have passed, it\u2019s due at least in part to Democrats\u2019 dire position in Washington. The party is far from power, and figures to remain so even if the midterms break its way, effectively allowing officials to kick these political and policy clashes down the road. Ocasio-Cortez, meanwhile, is settling in to a remarkable new normal. Apart from Sanders, with whom she campaigned in Kansas on Friday for primary hopefuls James Thompson and Brent Welder ahead of the state\u2019s August 7 vote, there might not be a more in-demand ally for this year\u2019s slate of insurgent progressive Democrats. After Kansas, she hit Missouri to stump for Cori Bush. On Saturday, she will travel across Michigan with Abdul El-Sayed, the young Democratic primary candidate, endorsed on Wednesday by Sen. Bernie Sanders, vying to become the country\u2019s first Muslim governor. Chardo Richardson, down in Florida, figures to get a visit before his late August House primary, as does Ayanna Pressley in Massachusetts. There are more. It makes sense, too. If Ocasio-Cortez wants to make waves in Washington, a city that even in the Trump era obsesses over process and order, she\u2019ll need to show up with some equally impatient friends.",

            "article_content": "At his first news conference on Capitol Hill since being ousted in a New York primary last month, Rep. Joe Crowley took responsibility for the outcome \u2013 saying \u201cthis is on me\u201d \u2013 and attempted to downplay the significance of his name remaining on a third-party ballot line in November, chalking it up to the \u201carcane nature\u201d of New York state\u2019s election law. \u201cWe all play by the same rules and I think there are a confluence of things that led to this loss, but what I will say is this is on me,\u201d Crowley told reporters Wednesday, speaking about his June 26 loss to Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a 28-year-old democratic socialist. \u201cI did lose, and that\u2019s difficult. Not because of a lack of effort.\u201d Crowley confirmed that he had a \u201cbrief\u201d and \u201cpositive\u201d conversation with Ocasio-Cortez last week, the first since her win. The delay, he said, was simply due to \u201cmissed lines of communication.\u201d \u201cGoing back to election night, the primary night itself, neither side had each other\u2019s phone numbers, and maybe that\u2019s more reflective of the fact that people didn\u2019t see this coming, nor did we, quite frankly,\u201d Crowley said. Crowley also explained his decision to forgo a complicated procedure to remove his name from the ballot in New York\u2019s 14th District, arguing again that the \u201carcane nature of New York state election law\u201d \u2013 and not any zombie campaign plot \u2013 was to blame. As it stands, his name will appear on the Working Families Party line, a place he secured with the party\u2019s pre-primary endorsement, despite its subsequent request that he agree to have it removed. The age of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez \u201cWhat I think is important to understand is that there has been no direct communication between myself and the leaders of the Working Families Party \u2026 but indirect,\u201d Crowley said on Wednesday. \u201cBut in the indirect conversation the suggestion was that I would run for county clerk in Montgomery County in upstate New York, a county that I have visited but I have never lived in and don\u2019t plan on moving to, nor if I were elected would I serve in that capacity, as well there is a Democrat in that position right now that I would actually be hurting if I ran, theoretically.\u201d In an email, Bill Lipton, state director of the Working Families Party, questioned Crowley\u2019s definition of \u201cdirect,\u201d saying he had \u201cspoken to people very close to the congressman\u201d about getting him off the ballot. \u201cI called multiple times, stressed that this was of the highest importance to us, and made clear that my goal (was) to work with Crowley to find a way we could both agree on to remove him from the ballot line,\u201d Lipton said. \u201cWe weren\u2019t wedded to any particular option, though there were several. The message we received was that Crowley was uninterested in considering any such option.\u201d He added: \u201cIf Crowley would like to have further and direct conversations with leaders of the WFP to explore whether there are any avenues remaining to vacate the line, we\u2019d welcome that.\u201d According to the byzantine state law, Crowley would \u2013 as he has repeatedly noted \u2013 have to formally move out of the state, die, be convicted of a crime or agree to switch his nomination to another office \u2013 presumably down the ballot into a race he had no intention of contesting \u2013 in order to vacate his current place. Crowley has said he believes the process of moving his nomination is on par with \u201celection fraud\u201d and will not engage. (It is, in fact, legal.) Last week, former Democratic vice-presidential nominee Joe Lieberman, who lost a Democratic Senate primary in 2006 only to win re-election as an independent that fall, wrote an op-ed in The Wall Street Journal headlined, \u201cVote Joe Crowley, for Working Families.\u201d The piece called on Crowley to stay in the contest and for the district to take advantage of his ballot status. Lieberman left Democrats\u2019 good graces years ago and is unlikely to sway liberal voters, but his call provoked a response from Working Families Party national Chair Dan Cantor. In a New York Daily News op-ed Wednesday, Cantor called the party\u2019s endorsement of Crowley \u201ca mistake\u201d and urged voters to \u201cto stay away from our ballot line\u201d in this case. Crowley\u2019s insistence on Wednesday that he was out of the race echoed pushback from earlier this month, when Ocasio-Cortez publicly alleged that he was plotting a third party run. That kerfuffle began early on July 12, when Ocasio-Cortez called Crowley out on Twitter after a series of failed connections and accused him of \u201cmounting a third party challenge against me.\u201d Crowley quickly responded, tweeting that \u201cthe race is over and Democrats need to come together.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve made my support for you clear and the fact that I\u2019m not running,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve scheduled phone calls and your team has not followed through. I\u2019d like to connect but I\u2019m not willing to air grievances on Twitter.\u201d I don\u2019t plan on moving out of New York, have a clean record, hope God\u2019s will is that I don\u2019t die, and won\u2019t commit what I honestly believe to be election fraud. https://t.co/Cxk3s5zALi Asked point-blank by CNN on Wednesday if he is asking his constituents not to vote for him, even as they see his name appearing alongside that of Ocasio-Cortez on the ballot, Crowley said: \u201cWell, I\u2019ve said I\u2019m not running, so, I\u2019ve consistently said that.\u201d In an email, a Crowley campaign spokesperson said the message should be clear, writing: \u201cJoe Crowley isn\u2019t running, isn\u2019t campaigning and said he supports Ms. Ocasio-Cortez. This is a non-story and non-issue.\u201d A spokesman for Ocasio-Cortez was reluctant to engage again on the question of Crowley\u2019s future. \u201cWe are dead-square focused on winning our election in November,\u201d communications director Corbin Trent said, \u201cand feel confident that we have a strong campaign and that we have the support of the community.\u201d Crowley\u2019s expected departure at the end of this term will open up a spot in Democratic leadership, leading to questions on Wednesday over whom, if anyone, he intends to back in the race to take over his job. House Democrats vote to hold elections on or after December 5 Taking questions with Democratic caucus Vice Chair Rep. Linda Sanchez standing next to him, Crowley said he is not endorsing anyone for his position and doesn\u2019t intend to \u2013 at least \u201cnot at this point.\u201d Sanchez and Rep. Barbara Lee, both Californians, announced last week they would run for Crowley\u2019s seat as chair of the Democratic caucus. While he sang the praises of Sanchez \u2013 and acknowledged that Lee was running \u2013 Crowley said he would let the next Democratic class make its own decisions. (As an outgoing member of Congress, Crowley doesn\u2019t have a vote in the leadership elections.) \u201cI will be the chair during that election, for one issue. The other is I think that it\u2019s also up to the next caucus to decide who their leadership should be, and therefore I think we have tremendous talent within our caucus,\u201d he said. \u201cLinda Sanchez certainly amongst them, as she stands with me here today.\u201d",

            "article_content": "The socialist filmmakers who produced one of 2018\u2019s most viral campaign ads are back with a sequel, this time for Kaniela Ing, a House candidate and political ally of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez who\u2019s running in Hawaii\u2019s 1st Congressional District. Naomi Burton and Nick Hayes, Detroit-based members of the Democratic Socialists of America, connected with Ing after their ad for the Ocasio-Cortez campaign become an online sensation. Also a DSA member, Ing was among the first candidates touted by Ocasio-Cortez after her victory on June 26. A Hawaii for the many is possible, but we have to take it, together. On August 11, this movement can make history, but I need your help.Please Retweet this video, Donate, and sign up to knock on doors, send texts + https://t.co/dELbZgUFNP#Ing2018 pic.twitter.com/aGXwSj4m5f Ing, 29, was first elected to Hawaii\u2019s state House at age 23. He is now part of a crowded primary field vying to replace Democratic Rep. Colleen Hanabusa, who is leaving Congress to run for governor. His campaign, backed like Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s by the progressive Justice Democrats, is banking on grass-roots organizers and a political platform that includes Medicare for all, the rejection of corporate money and his newly unveiled \u201chousing for all\u201d plan, which includes new rent stabilization laws and a \u201cTenant\u2019s Bill of Rights.\u201d Producers Burton and Hayes, who met at a DSA gathering soon after the 2016 election and founded their small media company, Means of Production, in 2017, were paid less than $10,000 for the Ocasio-Cortez ad. After it exploded on social media, they reached out to Ing on Twitter, pitched him and \u2013 for about $15,000 this time \u2013 were off to Hawaii a few weeks ago to start filming. The ad is expected be digital-only, Ing\u2019s campaign said. The Ocasio-Cortez video never aired on television. It's time for a New York that works for all of us.On June 26th, we can make it happen - but only if we have the #CourageToChange.It's time to get to work. Please retweet this video and sign up to knock doors + more at https://t.co/kacKFI9RtI to bring our movement to Congress. pic.twitter.com/aqKMjovEjZ Though shot about 5,000 miles apart, the ads share a feel and message. Both begin in the apartments of the candidates, who in their narration demand a brand of politics \u201cfor the many\u201d \u2013 political language with roots and resonance on the left. The ads, Hayes said, strive to create \u201ca visual language that is a little bit confrontational.\u201d Ing wrote his own script, which took words from his social media posts, speeches and remarks at recent debates. The filmmakers followed him around for about a week earlier this month, giving the video a \u201cdocumentary hybrid\u201d vibe, Hayes said. Getting together, Ing told CNN, was simple. Sharing a language that is still mostly unfamiliar even to many liberal Democrats also helped. \u201cThe donor class wants to dress our ideas as somehow radical,\u201d Ing said in an interview. \u201cThat\u2019s the reason why we focus on (in the campaign and video) a message of, \u2018We are the many and they are few.\u2019 We have support from the vast majority of people. What\u2019s radical is thinking that carrying on the way things are will somehow solve them.\u201d The Ing ad bounces back and forth between more familiar images of Hawaii, with massive glass structures rising over picturesque beaches, and those mostly hidden from Americans on the mainland \u2013 shots of the homeless, many native Hawaiians and veterans, who have been shut out and left behind. \u201cIt was the same thing in New York,\u201d Burton says, talking about the Ocasio-Cortez ad, \u201cshowing the skylines, showing the massive amount of development that\u2019s happening that everybody knows is completely out of their reach. It\u2019s the same issue in Hawaii.\u201d The absence of institutional support for leftist candidates has been a point of frustration among activists as insurgent campaigns are increasingly confronted with more intense mainstream media scrutiny and political attacks. That means developing new think tanks to help workshop policy and talking points, but also creating a media hub for electoral activities. So if the Ocasio-Cortez ad and Ing\u2019s strike a familiar tone, it\u2019s not by coincidence. \u201cOur strategy right now is to create a cohesive front of socialist congressional candidates to take on the Democratic establishment, and we\u2019re working to make sure all of those videos feel similar to one another because they exist within the same universe,\u201d Hayes said. Next up for the pair: Massachusetts\u2019 Ayanna Pressley, the first black woman to serve on the city council in Boston. She\u2019s challenging Democratic Rep. Michael Capuano in the state\u2019s 7th District. \u201cVote her in next,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez tweeted a few hours after securing her own victory over another 10-term incumbent, Rep. Joe Crowley. Even with the backing of Ocasio-Cortez and the left\u2019s most in-demand ad-makers, Ing faces what might be an even steeper uphill fight to win his primary. Former Rep. Ed Case entered the race late and leads in the most recent round of polling, published last week by the Honolulu Star-Advertiser, with 36% of likely voters. Lt. Gov. Doug Chin (27%) and state Sen. Donna Kim (14%) are second and third. Ing trails with 6%. The primary is August 11. Correction: This story has been updated to correct the polling numbers for Kim and Chin.",

            "article_content": "First things first: The theme song of the week is the theme to \u201cWill & Grace,\u201d by Jonathan Wolff. Polls of the week: A Quinnipiac poll of New York\u2019s upcoming Democratic gubernatorial primary has Gov. Andrew Cuomo leading Cynthia Nixon 59% to 23%. Cuomo\u2019s lead increased from Quinnipiac\u2019s last poll, which had Cuomo up 50% to 28%. It\u2019s the eighth poll of the race overall that has Cuomo ahead of Nixon by at least 20 percentage points. What\u2019s the big idea: This race was supposed to be a marquee match-up for the left wing of the Democratic Party. Cuomo has a history of siding with Republicans in the state Senate, and the state\u2019s progressive Working Class Party backed Nixon. It would have been the capstone for progressives after Democratic socialist Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez defeated New York\u2019s Rep. Joe Crowley in a primary in June. The left, though, hasn\u2019t been able to make a dent in Cuomo. His current margin over Nixon is actually larger than his margin over progressive challenger Zephyr Teachout in the 2014 Democratic primary for governor. Cuomo\u2019s large lead is emblematic of two important trends in the Democratic Party. The first, and perhaps most obvious, is that progressives look likely to fail in their biggest 2018 tests in the two biggest blue states. Besides Cuomo, Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California looks to be on her way to victory against Kevin de Leon. As with Nixon, progressive activists have endorsed his campaign. Voters overall, though, have a different perspective. Feinstein ended up 32 points ahead of de Leon in June\u2019s top-two primary. She also holds a large lead over him in general election polls. While the #resistance is strong in both states, neither is a haven for the left wing of the Democratic Party quite yet. The second trend is that Cuomo\u2019s lead is indicative of is the continually poor showing by progressive insurgents among black voters. Cuomo is leading across pretty much all demographic groups, but he\u2019s particularly strong among African-Americans. Although no crosstab of black voters was available in the Quinnipiac poll, an earlier Siena College poll put Cuomo\u2019s margin over Nixon among black voters at 74% to 17%. His advantage among black voters is no fluke. When Ocasio-Cortez was cruising district-wide, she was weak in black neighborhoods. She was able to win in large part because of strength in areas with larger white populations. Progressive Daniel Biss lost the Illinois gubernatorial primary earlier this year at least partially because he ran weak in the black neighborhoods of Chicago. In 2016, Sen. Bernie Sanders, a Vermont independent who caucuses with Democrats, could never quite overcome Hillary Clinton\u2019s connection with black voters. She won them in New York by 50 points, for example. Even for Cuomo, a black base is nothing new. When he beat Teachout four years ago, he did best in areas that were predominantly black. Of course, Ocasio-Cortez was able to win overall anyway. That wasn\u2019t the case for the progressives in the other examples, though. It\u2019s tough for progressive challengers to win when they lose by 50 points among a group who make up more than a fifth of the electorate. Why are progressive insurgents struggling with black voters? Black Democrats are more likely to consider themselves moderate or conservative than other Democrats. They also are more likely to identify as Democrats instead of independents who lean Democratic. That is, they are far more comfortable with the more moderate Democratic establishment than other Democrats are, especially whites. Now obviously it\u2019s possible for progressive challengers to win a primary even with this difficulty (see Ocasio-Cortez). But until candidates like Nixon and Sanders solve their black voter problem, they\u2019re going to be limited in their electoral victories.",

Simultaneously, in the preponderantly white, working-class and rural 9th Congressional District of Virginia, which includes this picturesque town in the state\u2019s far southwestern corner, Trump\u2019s popularity is reinforcing the strength of Republican Rep. Morgan Griffith, who captured the seat from a veteran Democrat during the GOP landslide of 2010. The contrasting prospects for Comstock and Griffith crystallize how the 2018 election could complete the geographic restructuring of the House that first fully snapped into view during that GOP sweep eight years ago. In 2010, amid a sharp backlash against President Barack Obama, the GOP ousted dozens of House Democrats from small-town and rural districts; the casualties included many who had held their seats for decades, like Rick Boucher, the longtime Democratic representative from the 9th District who Griffith beat. Now the GOP faces the inverse risk: Democrats in November could sweep out 20 or more House Republicans like Comstock from districts centered on white-collar suburbs around the nation\u2019s biggest cities where Trump is unpopular. We have had two countries for a while, but it is as if, appropriately enough under Trump, the walls are being raised. They are higher than ever. Larry Sabato \u201cThis could be very easily be a mirror image election (to 2010) from the Democratic side,\u201d says Rep. Tom Cole of Oklahoma, a leading House Republican strategist. The biggest question for November, of course, is whether Democrats will gain the 24 seats they need to recapture the House majority. But whether or not they do, November could produce a realigning election that remakes the composition of the parties\u2019 coalitions in the House. Just as 2010 triggered an extended period of Republican advantage in small-town and rural districts, 2018 could do the same for Democrats in white-collar seats inside the largest metropolitan areas. The result would be a geographic separation in the House as stark as any in modern times. Democrats seem likely to emerge from this fall\u2019s election with a clear upper hand in highly urbanized House seats that are racially and religiously diverse, disproportionately white-collar and secular and connected to the globalized information economy. Republicans, in turn, could remain dominant in districts outside of urban centers that are preponderantly white, heavily blue-collar, more religiously traditional and reliant on manufacturing, agriculture and resource extraction. The ideological, demographic, economic and even physical distance between the coalitions \u2013 the trench separating red and blue America \u2013 could be even greater than it is today. \u201cYou look at the map \u2013 and any (place) that has a disproportionately rural electorate \u2013 and you can count it as Republican in any election, and the opposite is true in those suburban/urban\u201d areas, says Larry Sabato, a University of Virginia political scientist. \u201cWe have had two countries for a while, but it is as if, appropriately enough under Trump, the walls are being raised. They are higher than ever. And I\u2019m afraid that is going to be even more true in 2020 than in 2018.\u201d This accelerating separation leaves both parties in a precarious position. Many Republicans worry that under Trump they are losing support in the places that are adding population and jobs and increasingly relying on the places that are shrinking or stagnating on both fronts. As opposed to a wave, this looks like a realignment and that\u2019s scarier. Former Republican Rep. Tom Davis \u201cAs opposed to a wave, this (election) looks like a realignment and that\u2019s scarier,\u201d says Tom Davis, a former Republican representative from Northern Virginia, who chaired the National Republican Congressional Committee during his years in the House. \u201cThat is a bigger problem for Republicans long term, because we are winning the places that are not the growing tide (in population), they are the shrinking tide, and that\u2019s not where you want to be.\u201d Some Democrats, in turn, fear that even greater dominance of the largest metropolitan areas will still leave them operating with too narrow a geographic base of support to consistently control majorities not only in the House, but also in the Senate and the Electoral College. In 2016, after all, Hillary Clinton won the popular vote by obliterating Trump in the largest places \u2013 she won 87 of the 100 largest counties by more than 15 million votes combined \u2013 yet Trump carried the Electoral College by routing her outside of the big urban areas in enough of the battleground states, from North Carolina and Florida to Michigan and Wisconsin. \u201cIf you can combine a \u2026 respectable showing in some of these other areas of the country with obviously growing strength in urban and inner suburban areas and white-collar constituencies, then you have a winning formula,\u201d says long-term Democratic strategist Ruy Teixeira. \u201cThe strength in these (metropolitan) areas can be canceled out by the structural problems in these other (small-town) areas.\u201d The divergent dynamics separating suburban and small-town America are neatly encapsulated in Virginia\u2019s 9th and 10th congressional districts. Though each is now represented by a Republican, the two places could hardly be more different. Whites represent almost 90% of the population in the 9th District, but only about 61% in the 10th. Immigrants (largely Hispanic and Asian) represent over 20% of the population in the 10th but less than 3% in the 9th. Just over half of the adults in the 10th District hold at least a four-year college degree, compared with only about 1-in-5 in the 9th. The median income in the 10th, at $120,384, is nearly triple its level in the 9th, less than $42,000. The fact that Democratic prospects are rising in the district that is more affluent, better-educated and more racially diverse and are sagging in the district that is the opposite on each count testifies to the larger shifts that have remade the two parties\u2019 electoral coalitions over the past several decades. Particularly since the 1980s, the parties have experienced what I\u2019ve called a \u201cclass inversion,\u201d with Republicans growing stronger among the blue-collar whites who anchored the Democratic coalition for decades after World War II and Democrats adding growing competitiveness among white-collar whites (especially women) to their traditional advantages among nonwhite voters. Typically, such changes in electoral behavior have been felt at the presidential level long before they filter down to congressional races. Republicans, for instance, started consistently winning Southern states at the presidential level in 1972 but didn\u2019t capture a majority of the region\u2019s congressional seats until 1994. Similarly, while Republicans built a solid advantage in small-town and rural areas at the presidential level starting in 2000, they did not immediately beat many of the House Democrats representing those areas. Instead, the watershed election came in 2010 for rural and small-town Democratic House members such as Rick Boucher, who had held his Southwest Virginia seat for nearly 30 years. Boucher had deep roots in the district: He was born in Abingdon, and his grandfather had represented the area in the Virginia House of Delegates. He still remembers the town when it followed more bucolic rhythms. These divisions don\u2019t start in Washington DC and come down; they are in the country and working up. Republican Rep. Tom Cole \u201cIt was a place where farmers came to market and brought their goods,\u201d Boucher told me recently in an interview in the backyard of his home on Abingdon\u2019s peaceful main street.  \u201cThe downtown on Saturdays was packed. People were walking from one end of town to the other.\u201d Boucher represented the area in the Virginia state Senate for eight years, and then in 1982 he beat a longtime Republican incumbent to win the area\u2019s congressional seat. Boucher had a close squeeze in 1984, when he narrowly survived the Ronald Reagan landslide to win a second term. After that, he won re-election to Virginia\u2019s 9th Congressional District 12 more times, never capturing less than 59% of the vote, even as his culturally conservative, coal-producing and rural district steadily tilted its votes toward Republican presidential candidates. Republican presidential nominees George W. Bush in 2004 and John McCain in 2008 each carried nearly three-fifths of the district. Boucher survived by avoiding cultural conflicts wherever possible (he opposed President Bill Clinton\u2019s key gun-control initiatives, for instance) and concentrating on bread-and-butter economic concerns. \u201cWhat I was doing through all of those years was attracting federal funds to build industrial parks, water systems, wastewater systems. I developed my own program for attracting industry,\u201d he recalls. But in 2010, Boucher\u2019s string ran out. Obama\u2019s first two years had stirred a huge conservative backlash in the district, with both the Affordable Care Act and the legislation passed by House Democrats to limit the carbon emissions linked to global climate change emerging as powerful flashpoints. Republican nominee Griffith, a former GOP majority leader in the state House, particularly emphasized Boucher\u2019s support for the \u201ccap and trade\u201d bill restricting carbon emissions, which was anathema in the area\u2019s coal-producing communities. For Mark Matney, a teacher in Abingdon who usually votes Republican but had sometimes supported Boucher, that was the breaking point. I\u2019m tickled to death he\u2019s our President. Mark Matney on Donald Trump \u201cWhen people wanted something done and they went to Rick, he seemed to get it done. I mean, I\u2019ve seen many families he helped,\u201d Matney told me.  \u201cThen when Obama come in, Rick helped author cap and trade. It was at that moment when it got bad. When he done that with cap and trade, it was like he wasn\u2019t representing his people anymore.\u201d Boosted by heavy spending from outside conservative groups who linked Boucher to Obama and House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi in a barrage of television advertising, Griffith, a Republican state House member, blew past the Democrat in 2010 by nearly 10,000 votes. Boucher was hardly alone: The 2010 election virtually annihilated the center-right so-called \u201cblue dog\u201d Democratic House members, who mostly represented preponderantly white, heavily blue-collar, small-town and rural districts. Among those swept away that fall were Jim Oberstar in Minnesota (first elected in 1974), Gene Taylor from Mississippi (1989, in a special election), Ike Skelton of Missouri (1976), Earl Pomeroy of North Dakota (1992), Paul Kanjorski of Pennsylvania (1984), John Spratt of South Carolina (1982) and Chet Edwards of Texas (1990), as well as a long list of small-town Democrats who had won more recently. Jon Vogel, now a Democratic consultant, was executive director of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee during the GOP\u2019s 2010 sweep. He says it wasn\u2019t complacency that doomed the blue dog rural Democrats, it was that many voters who had long split their tickets between local Democrats and presidential Republicans were no longer willing to do so with Obama in the White House. Being traditional raised up here I always started out a meeting with the Pledge of Allegiance and a prayer and a couple of times I was asked not to pray. So, I thought, well, something\u2019s not right. Blake Andis \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone was caught napping,\u201d Vogel says. \u201cAll of those guys got ready and ran their campaigns, but you couldn\u2019t survive what was coming. You couldn\u2019t overcome the DNA of the district, no matter how good a campaign you ran.\u201d Republicans have since solidified their hold over Boucher\u2019s old district. Griffith has carried at least three-fifths of the vote in each of his three re-elections. While Boucher and other Democrats view their 2018 nominee, farmer Anthony Flaccavento, as an energetic candidate, Griffith remains a strong favorite in part because of Trump\u2019s solid popularity here. Trump carried 68% of the vote in the 9th District in 2016 (the most in any Virginia US House district) and Matney says none of the personal and political controversies swirling around the President have dented his standing with conservatives here. \u201cTo be 100% honest with you, no,\u201d he says. \u201cThey think that he\u2019s up there to do what we want him to do: protect our guns, protect our rights, less government, more jobs. That\u2019s all they see, and I\u2019m tickled to death he\u2019s our President.\u201d Trump\u2019s strong approval ratings among the white non-college and Christian voters who constitute a larger share of small-town and rural districts represent a huge headwind for Democrats in such places this fall. The party is targeting several Republicans in seats that fit that description, such as the northeast Iowa seat held by Rod Blum, the northern Maine seat held by Bruce Poliquin, John Faso\u2019s upstate New York seat and Rodney Davis\u2019 district in downstate Illinois. But, by far, the Democrats\u2019 best opportunities are clustered in urban and suburban areas. In those places, Trump faces much lower approval ratings than usual for a Republican president among college-educated white voters, especially women. In the latest Quinnipiac University national poll, Trump\u2019s net disapproval rating among college-educated whites (19 points negative) was almost exactly as bad as Obama\u2019s among blue-collar whites in Pew Research Center polling (20 points negative) just before Republicans routed the small-town House Democrats in 2010. I thought, \u2018No way, he\u2019s not going to win,\u2019 but when he did, I decided I had to start doing something because Congress is the only check. Amanda Kelly With that tailwind, Democrats are pursuing Republican-held suburban seats in every region. In the East, they have multiple opportunities around New York City, Philadelphia, Miami and New Jersey; in Virginia, they have a strong shot not only at Comstock but also at Republican Rep. Dave Brat, who holds a seat centered on the Richmond suburbs that swung toward Democrats in last fall\u2019s gubernatorial and state House elections. In the Midwest, Democrats are targeting suburban Republican-held seats around Chicago; Minneapolis; Kansas City, Missouri; Des Moines, Iowa; and more distantly Omaha, Nebraska. In the far West, Democrats have good chances in suburban Republican-held seats around Los Angeles and nearby Orange County; Tucson, Arizona; Denver; San Antonio; and Seattle. Democrats are also seriously contesting seats in Sunbelt metro areas that have previously been considered safe for Republicans, including districts around Atlanta; Charlotte, North Carolina; Dallas; and Houston. The Republican losses in white-collar House seats this year almost certainly won\u2019t match the Democratic retreat in blue-collar seats in 2010 because the GOP doesn\u2019t have quite as many members in seats that have moved away from the party at the presidential level. But the general dynamic, and direction, of change could prove very similar: The suburban Republicans in 2018, like the small-town Democrats in 2010, are standing on floorboards of support that have been rotting for years \u2013 and may not be able to survive the added weight of hardening discontent with a President from their party. Comstock\u2019s embattled situation in Virginia\u2019s 10th District captures that problem. First elected in 2014, Comstock won re-election in 2016 with 53% of the vote, although Clinton carried 52% there. With Trump in office, though, the district broke decisively last November for Democrat Ralph Northam over Republican Ed Gillespie in the governor\u2019s race and swept out several Republicans holding seats in the state House that overlapped with Comstock\u2019s seat. The first general election public poll in the district, by Monmouth University, showed the Democratic nominee, state Sen. Jennifer Wexton, leading Comstock by an imposing 10 percentage points. A 53% majority of the district\u2019s voters said they disapproved of Trump\u2019s performance, and more than four-fifths of them said they intended to vote against Comstock. \u201cI think everybody is looking at her race and saying, \u2018How in the world does she win?\u2019 \u201d says Sabato, the University of Virginia political scientist. Like many suburban Republicans, Comstock is running in a diversifying district (Hispanics, Asians and minorities who classify themselves as \u201cother\u201d combine for about 32% of the population). Democrats are hoping for the same kind of strong turnout among them that helped Kathy Tran, a refugee from South Vietnam, win a House of Delegates seat last fall in a district that overlaps with Comstock\u2019s. \u201cI think that the energy that we really helped to start in 2017 is \u2026 going (to) be a huge tsunami in November,\u201d said Tran, who became one of the first two Asian-American women in the state House. \u201cMy experience in Virginia has been that we have turned the corner and the vast majority of people want a welcoming and inclusive commonwealth.\u201d Comstock, like the other suburban Republicans, also risks being caught in the backlash against Trump among many college-educated white voters, especially women. (In the Monmouth poll, 60% of the district\u2019s whites with a college degree disapproved of Trump\u2019s performance.) And she is confronting a surge of energy among liberal-leaning voters, even many of those who had not previously been politically active. Amanda Kelly, a retail store manager from Bluemont, is one of those. She didn\u2019t vote until she was 30 (for Obama in 2008) and before the 2016 election couldn\u2019t name her governor or US representative. All that changed after Trump\u2019s victory. \u201cAt the rallies I saw violence, I saw racism, assault, terrible things (and) I thought, \u2018No way, he\u2019s not going to win,\u2019 \u201d she says. \u201cBut when he did, I decided I had to start doing something, because Congress is the only check.\u201d Now Kelly has become a tireless activist in Indivisible, the grass-roots Democratic group committed to opposing Trump, as well as other local political organizations; in the 24 hours before I spoke with her last month, she had participated in two separate demonstrations (one that required her to arrive at 4 a.m. to start setting up) over Trump\u2019s family separation practice. \u201cPeople feel really passionate,\u201d she says. \u201cYou know, fortunately Trump provides a lot of fodder for that.\u201d Over 300 miles away in the state\u2019s far southwest corner, Matney is just as passionate in his embrace of Trump and his determination to maintain the Republican congressional majority that supports and defends the President. If anything, Matney says, as a socially conservative Republican he feels more connected to Trump in office than he did as a candidate. These clashing perspectives demonstrate why the midterm election is less likely to produce a wave that rolls equally across the country than a split-level current that carries metropolitan America closer to the Democrats without seriously breaching the Republican fortress beyond it. That could leave the Congress, and the country, glaring across demographic and geographic divides etched as sharply as during the most polarized times in American history. \u201cIt means legislative gridlock,\u201d says Cole, the Republican representative from Oklahoma. \u201cI always tell people I don\u2019t have a Democratic member of Congress who lives within 200 miles of me in any direction. These divisions don\u2019t start in Washington, DC, and come down; they are in the country and working up. \u2026 We have been seeing this coming for a while. But we really are in an age of regionalization of politics that is reminiscent of the 1850s.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Democratic members of Congress are starting to accept that they may lose parts, if not all, of their status as superdelegates to the Democratic National Convention in 2020 when the party votes for its nominee for president. Reps. David Price, Gregory Meeks, Rosa DeLauro and Grace Meng \u2013 a Democratic National Committee vice chair \u2013 met Wednesday with Chairman Tom Perez, American Federation of Teachers President Randi Weingarten and Lee Saunders, president of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, to discuss the superdelegate proposals required to be passed by the end of the month. Congressional Democrats \u2013 all of whom are designated superdelegates, automatic unleashed delegates who can vote for any nominee \u2013 have been meeting with Perez about proposals to strip away that status for the 2020 convention. Other superdelegates include former Democratic presidents, governors, senators and DNC members. During a meeting with Perez last week, many members were angry about proposals to rid the party of superdelegates completely. According to a source with knowledge of the meeting, members of Congress want to maintain their status but \u201cunderstand the political dynamics at play.\u201d Grass-roots activists have been working to get the DNC to eliminate superdelegates, claiming such delegates gave Hillary Clinton an advantage over her fellow candidates, like Sen. Bernie Sanders, during the 2016 primary process. A unity commission was formed to propose changes for the DNC Rules and Bylaws Committee to pass by the end of this month. At Wednesday\u2019s meeting, first reported by Politico, the members felt \u201cheard\u201d and seemed to be more pliable to the changes, according to the source. \u201cWe had a good, open discussion in which we were able to voice our views and have them taken seriously,\u201d Rep. Rosa DeLauro said in a statement to CNN. Relations between the DNC and members of Congress that had frayed over the plan to curb the influence of superdelegates in the presidential nomination process are getting better, a source with knowledge of the negotiations tells CNN, but disagreements persist. \u201cYesterday\u2019s meeting was a constructive effort, and nobody wants a fight on this, but the idea that we\u2019re at or near consensus as some have suggested, is definitely a stretch,\u201d the source said. They added that while this meeting was better than previous, more contentious, affairs, the issues \u201cwere not resolved.\u201d Rep. David Price, in an interview with CNN on Thursday, said the disagreements between the DNC and members of Congress were \u201ca work in progress,\u201d but that their latest meeting was \u201ccordial\u201d and \u201cinformative.\u201d \u201cThe ball is in their court, not ours,\u201d said Price, who was brought in because he was the executive director of the Hunt Commission that re-evaluated the Democratic nomination process after the 1980 election that led to the creation of superdelegates. Price said \u201cseveral\u201d proposals were floated at the Tuesday meeting, but that one of the key concerns from the members of Congress was the idea that they would have to run against their own constituents to be a delegate to the DNC if they lose their current status. He added that he believes it is possible to reduce the number of unpledged delegates but not deny them their vote in the process. He declined to get into those specifics. \u201cThis is not about one class of delegates versus another, it is about how do you have inclusive convention that includes everyone that needs to be there,\u201d he said. \u201cI would say that is more for the party\u2019s benefit than anyone else. And Meng, who also serves as a DNC Vice Chair, said in a statement that she feels she has a unique role \u201cmaking sure that the DNC is listening to the concerns that House Democrats have with the current proposal\u201d and ensuring that \u201cthe DNC is listening to the concerns of activists and organizations to ensure that their voices are heard as well.\u201d She declined to comment on any of the plans \u201cuntil the Rules and Bylaws Committee is finished\u201d with its work. Rules committee members met in Rhode Island last Friday to discuss new proposals. Weingarten, a member of the committee, proposed keeping some superdelegates with all rights except voting for the party\u2019s nominee on the first ballot at their convention. The \u201cthird way\u201d plan (as it was called) was supported by Perez. Some committee members, including many who represent minority communities, argued excluding superdelegates on the first ballot was tantamount to voter disenfranchisement. As a compromise, members seemed to agree in principle with Minnesota DFL Chairman Ken Martin\u2019s proposal to find a way to keep superdelegates on the first ballot so long as they don\u2019t affect the outcome of the vote \u2013 known as the \u201cthird way plus\u201d plan. Both plans were discussed at Wednesday\u2019s meeting. Only one plan was proposed by the members, according to the source, but it did not conform with the unity commission\u2019s requirements to reduce the number of superdelegates by two-thirds. Rules committee members will vote on a final proposal by the end of the month, which will need a full DNC vote at its August meeting in Chicago. ",

In the aftermath of Alabama\u2019s roller coaster Senate special election in December 2017, a national spotlight was shone on the black women who turned out in large numbers to vote for Democrat Doug Jones. Making up 17% of the electorate, 98% of black women cast a ballot for Jones, who many thought would never represent the very red state. Six months later, more than 70 black women are running for electoral office in Alabama, says Stacie Propst, executive director of Emerge Alabama, a Democratic candidate training program. That number doesn\u2019t capture the candidates running for county and municipal offices, says Propst, who just ran a boot camp for female candidates in Mobile this past weekend. Propst, an Alabama native, points to Donald Trump\u2019s surprise win in 2016 as a galvanizing force and says she\u2019s never seen this many African American women running for office in the state. All but two of the black women running are Democrats, and organizers say a strong showing in such a red state sends a message to the rest of the country. \u201cThe tide is shifting, and these southern states are showing the rest of the country, again as they always have, that we can lead, and we can change the world,\u201d says Rhonda Briggins, co-founder of VoteRunLead and Alabama native. \u201cIf you look at history, especially Alabama history, civil rights history, women have always led those charges, and have been the ones working very diligently, behind the scenes, organizing.\u201d VoteRunLead is a nonpartisan effort to train women to run for office and Briggins says Alabama\u2019s rejection of Republican Roy Moore \u2013 after multiple accusations of unwanted sexual advances toward young women \u2013 motivated African American women to get more involved in politics. \u201cNow that storm is brewing, I think it\u2019s only going to grow,\u201d Briggins says of the national attention on black women as a voting bloc. \u201cThey\u2019ve turned these cliches into a reality, of \u2018Black Girl Magic.\u2019 I think people really believe that. I think people really believe they can make a difference, and all you have to do is put yourself out there and do it.\u201d Briggins says judicial positions represent a unique opportunity for black women to impact their local communities. \u201cIf we\u2019re going to do something about Black Lives Matter then it starts with our local judicial system, it starts with our local policing powers,\u201d Briggins says. \u201cPeople are now connecting the dots to their lives and connecting that to the political power and influence and then pulling all of these pieces together to create real change.\u201d Around 18 black women are running for circuit, district and probate judge positions in Jefferson County, where voters chose Jones 68% to 31% over Moore. Three of those women running graduated in Emerge Alabama\u2019s inaugural training class, and they\u2019ve \u201cbecome like a family.\u201d \u201cWe call each other, we text each other,\u201d says Jameria Moore, who is running for probate judge. \u201cWe talk all the time just encouraging each other. So this has been just a wonderful sisterhood.\u201d Clotele Hardy Brantley, who is running for the district court, met Moore on the campaign trail, but has known Marshell Jackson Hatcher, running for the circuit court, for around 15 years. Moore says she met Hatcher when she first passed the bar, around 12 years ago. The three are also Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority sisters and say that sharing the campaign experience has knit them closer together. Moore and Hatcher turned to Brantley, who has for office before, for advice. \u201cThis was our first time and we didn\u2019t know what to do and when you go to this event, how are you supposed to present yourself, or what to expect. And so we were relying on what you were telling us,\u201d Hatcher says. They shared tips about elevator pitches, and the best places to get face time with voters. \u201cMost people congregate on Sundays, at churches. You get a mass amount of people at churches. It\u2019s a little bit easier than going knocking door-to-door, especially in the Alabama heat,\u201d Moore told CNN. They have supported each other through the ups and downs of running for office and feel optimistic no matter the outcome. \u201cI am claiming victory. And I have from the day that I decided to run this time,\u201d Brantley said of Tuesday\u2019s primary. \u201cThis is my time, I\u2019ve claimed it.\u201d However, the motivation to run doesn\u2019t just belong to African American women who are Democrats in Alabama. Cherokee County has only one African American woman running for office in either party: 18-year-old Jayla McElrath, running as a Republican. McElrath graduated from Cedar Bluffs High School just a week ago and is running for County Board of Education. She says her mom always told her \u201cto think outside the box\u201d and after being elected to student government, and serving on the local city council committee, she was determined to improve learning conditions for other students. She was too young to vote in the Senate special election but said she was following the race intently and probably would have voted for Jones. McElrath says she was inspired by President Barack Obama to see a black man as president even if she disagreed with his positions, but also takes inspiration from President Donald Trump. \u201cYou can come from a different background anywhere and create change,\u201d McElrath says. \u201cHe thinks outside of the box too.\u201d",

            "article_content": "The US Secret Service overpaid presidential campaigns an estimated $4 million for plane travel during the 2016 election, a government watchdog says in a new report obtained by CNN. Secret Service officials realized eight months before Election Day that they were using the wrong formula to calculate the costs, \u201cbut did not ensure the agency reverted to its longstanding policy,\u201d according to the Government Accountability Office report. The Secret Service, which incurred millions of dollars in travel expenses to provide security during presidential campaigns, said it has asked the campaigns that were overpaid to provide the government refunds. GAO said the Secret Service spent an estimated $58 million on travel expenses related to the campaigns. Of that total, $17.1 million was paid to the campaigns of Donald Trump, Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders and Ben Carson as reimbursements for seats occupied by Secret Service agents onboard campaign charter flights. The report did not detail how much each campaign was overpaid, nor did it accuse the campaigns of wrongdoing. The Secret Service did not respond to a request from CNN for more detailed figures.  It said in a statement it is \u201cworking with all stakeholders in an effort to recover the overpaid amounts.\u201d In a May 14 letter to the GAO, which is attached to the report, the Secret Service said letters were sent to campaign committees requesting repayment by May 31, 2018. The Secret Service also said it instituted a new policy that will help it make more accurate payments. At least two of the four campaigns said they received the letter. \u201cTheir letter does not explain the legal basis for their believing they made errors. So we have requested more information to better understand what they are claiming,\u201d said Jeff Weaver, the campaign manager for Sanders\u2019 2016 bid. Carson\u2019s business manager Armstrong Williams said he met with Secret Service officials for a \u201crespectful\u201d discussion. He said Carson currently has \u201cno campaign,\u201d but declined to say whether that means the Secret Service will not be repaid. According to Federal Election Commission records, the Carson campaign had roughly $460,000 in its account as of the end of March. Spokespeople for the Trump and Clinton campaigns reached by CNN on Thursday did not immediately have information on the matter. The report detailed how much the Secret Service reimbursed each campaign for travel expenses: \u2022 Donald Trump: $7.3 million for 965 flights. \u2022 Hillary Clinton: $7.1 million for 1,317 flights. \u2022 Bernie Sanders: $2 million for 159 flights. \u2022 Ben Carson: $615,567 for 107 flights. In addition to those four candidates, the Secret Service also protected two vice presidential candidates and six of the candidates\u2019 family members during the 2016 campaign. Rep. Bennie Thompson, the top Democrat on the House committee overseeing the Secret Service, called the overpayments \u201cunacceptable,\u201d and urged the Secret Service to recoup the funds. \u201cWorse yet, they did not fix the error when it was discovered months before the election,\u201d Thompson told CNN in a statement. \u201cThe money that the agency needlessly and erroneously paid the campaigns is sorely needed to help fund critical Secret Service activities that have faced recent budget cuts \u2013 including investigations into cyber and financial crimes.\u201d The Secret Service\u2019s policy \u201chas been to pay the lower of two fares when reimbursing campaign committees for special agents\u2019 travel on chartered aircraft flights,\u201d the GAO said. \u201cThe lowest commercially available first class airfare or the pro rata fare- the cost of the agent\u2019s seat on the charter flight calculated by taking the total cost of the charter flight of the charter flight divided by the number of passengers on board.\u201d But agency policy did not require invoices and receipts from charter companies that would allow it to verify the costs were accurate, GAO found. Only Clinton\u2019s campaign provided those records. The Secret Service said it has changed that policy and said it will now review documents to verify the government is being accurately charged. The GAO also found the Trump campaign billed the Secret Service twice, \u201cfor three flight segments taken on March 1, 2016 resulting in a cumulative overpayment of approximately $21,000.\u201d CNN\u2019s Greg Wallace and Elizabeth Landers contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "In Washington, the burning debate is whether any of the legal challenges swirling around President Donald Trump will directly connect him to a criminal act. But the Democratic hopes of retaking the House, the Senate or both could pivot on whether the party can complete a very different connection: linking voters\u2019 perceptions of the Republican tax bill with the GOP\u2019s persistent efforts, in that bill and elsewhere, to roll back the federal role in guaranteeing access to health care. Trump\u2019s legal and ethical troubles \u2013 which took yet another dizzying turn last week with the scattershot revelations from his new legal adviser, former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani \u2013 are dominating the national news and blotting out other issues as thoroughly as an eclipse. That was symbolized last Friday, when Giuliani\u2019s unexpected revelations linking Trump to the payment made to adult film star Stormy Daniels almost obliterated coverage of the one-year anniversary of the House Republican vote to repeal the Affordable Care Act. The powerful pattern Democrats must break to win the Senate But in the district-by-district battle to retake the House, many Democrats are focusing less on condemning Trump\u2019s character than on discrediting the Republican agenda. Central to that mission is arguing that the GOP has benefited the wealthy, and burdened the middle class, with its twin legislative priorities of the past 17 months: passing a large tax cut and attempting to repeal the Affordable Care Act. Most political professionals and journalists talk about \u201cthe health care repeal and the Trump tax plan as two different issues,\u201d says Jesse Ferguson, a Democratic consultant working with outside groups supporting the ACA. \u201cThe voters see them as ways Washington isn\u2019t looking out for them. \u2026 On both of them, it\u2019s basically the same: they [Congressional Republicans] have been giving tax breaks to health insurance companies, to pharmaceutical companies and those come at the expense of people who work for a living. It means higher health care costs, eventually higher taxes, more debt for your kids, and cuts to Social Security and Medicare as you get older.\u201d Republican Rep. Tom Cole of Oklahoma, a longtime party electoral strategist, is dubious that Democrats can connect the tax cut and health care vote in a manner that erodes support for each, largely because the full ACA repeal didn\u2019t become law. What Republicans did accomplish in the tax bill was to zero out the penalty associated with not obtaining health insurance, which is likely to have the effect of tilting the insurance pool more heavily toward those with greater health needs, ultimately raising premiums. Elsewhere, Trump has made clear he intends to starve the ACA through administrative actions where he can. But Cole said he believes the two issues won\u2019t cross over. \u201cI don\u2019t see it as nearly as salient an issue,\u201d Cole says. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to beat you on a vote you didn\u2019t succeed on. The ACA wasn\u2019t repealed, and the only part of it that was was the least popular part: the individual mandate.\u201d But Democrats see reason for optimism in polls from the Kaiser Family Foundation showing that more Americans now view the ACA favorably than unfavorably and significantly more trust Democrats than Republicans to handle health care issues. A wide array of other surveys have found rising health care costs spiking to the top of the public\u2019s list of priorities for Washington. \u201cThis is the first real election that the defense of the ACA has turned into an asset,\u201d says Chris Jennings, a veteran Democratic health care expert. The solidifying Democratic decision to focus their local messaging more on health care and taxes than the ethical and legal storms constantly battering Trump represents an attempt to learn distinct lessons from the experience of both Bill and Hillary Clinton. The Hillary Clinton lesson is a negative one. In 2016, Clinton and the principal super PAC supporting her, Priorities USA, bet most of their chips on disqualifying Trump personally for voters. Initially, both the campaign and the super PAC signaled that they would place a heavy emphasis on undermining Trump\u2019s claim that as president he would champion the interests of average families. But after some initial salvos (notably a Hillary Clinton speech in Atlantic City that accused Trump of bilking small business contractors at his hotel), the party largely dropped that argument. Instead it focused mostly on painting Trump as unfit to serve as president, by morals, temperament and judgment. That case clearly found an audience: In the exit poll on Election Day in 2016, 61% of voters said they did not believe Trump was qualified to serve as president and 63% said they did not believe he was temperamentally suited for the job. But in the end, those concerns were not disqualifying for enough people: Nearly one-fifth of the voters who expressed such negative opinions about Trump personally still supported him over Hillary Clinton. The hard lesson many Democrats took from that experience is that if voters believe Trump is fighting for them, even some of those uneasy about his volatile personal behavior will excuse or at least accept it. Recent polling offers evidence that dynamic is holding. The nonpartisan Pew Research Center found last week that the share of Americans who say they \u201cdon\u2019t like\u201d Trump\u2019s conduct as President remains very high, at 54%. But the same national survey found that the share of Americans who say they mostly agree with Trump on issues has significantly increased, from only 33% last August \u2013 just after the ACA debate had peaked in the Senate \u2013 to 41% now. In new polling from CNN and SSRS released Monday, Trump\u2019s overall approval rating was similarly 41%, but he has seen improvement on key issues like the economy, where 52% approve of his performance. Why the electoral battlefield is expanding Not surprisingly, the Pew poll found that over three-fourths of those who said they didn\u2019t like Trump\u2019s behavior said they planned to vote Democratic for Congress, while over four-fifths of the smaller group that liked his behavior (about 1-in-5 adults overall) said they intended to vote Republican. Most telling perhaps was that a commanding majority of the roughly one-fourth of adults who said they had mixed feelings about Trump\u2019s personal behavior also said they intended to vote Republican in November. That suggested that even amid the unrelenting national media focus on Trump\u2019s ethical and moral controversies, Democrats were still struggling to reach beyond the universe of voters \u2013 admittedly a big pool \u2013 personally alienated from the President. If Hillary Clinton\u2019s excessive focus on Trump\u2019s character in 2016 offers a negative model on how to reach those voters, Bill Clinton\u2019s experience provides a more successful political precedent. After Clinton\u2019s chaotic first two years in office, he suffered a resounding repudiation when voters in 1994 swept Republicans to control of both the House and Senate. Led by then-House Speaker Newt Gingrich, the new GOP majorities moved quickly to press their advantage by passing a budget plan that cut taxes and slashed federal spending. But Clinton revived his presidency by arguing that Republicans had paid for their tax cut through simultaneous spending reductions in Medicare and Medicaid (as well as education and the environment). After two epic confrontations that shut down the government, Clinton forced the GOP to back down, pushed his job approval rating back past 50% and set himself on a path for an unexpectedly easy re-election in 1996. Democrats today are increasingly paralleling Bill Clinton\u2019s arguments from that era. Last month, the House Majority PAC, a leading Democratic super political action committee, ran digital ads against three Republican House incumbents \u2013 Andy Barr in Kentucky, Kevin Yoder in Kansas and Bruce Poliquin in Maine \u2013 that echoed Clinton\u2019s case during his showdown with Gingrich. Tellingly, the ads connected the GOP agenda not to Trump but to House Speaker Paul Ryan as the embodiment of the congressional Republican majority. \u201cPaul Ryan gave his wealthy friends a massive tax cut while cheating hardworking American families out of health care coverage,\u201d the ad declared. \u201cAnd to pay for the tax giveaway, Ryan has a plan to cut Medicare for seniors before he\u2019s through.\u201d (That last segment refers to Ryan\u2019s long-standing hope of converting Medicare into a \u201cpremium support\u201d system that provides seniors a fixed sum of money, or voucher, to buy private insurance.) The places that will decide the 2018 midterm elections Democratic strategists such as Ferguson, and Charlie Kelly, the House Majority PAC\u2019s executive director, see these messages not as competing but complementary to the national debate over whether the Republican-led Congress is providing Trump a blank check. \u201cThat conversation is happening,\u201d Kelly says. \u201cThe thing that really impacts individuals day to day are these kitchen table issues that are front and center and very personal. Health care is very personal, and it is something that is going to be a large focus for us.\u201d Democrats talk about the twin arguments operating almost in a form of political stereo. They believe the controversies around Trump dominating the national media are energizing turnout from the party\u2019s base (and inhibiting the GOP\u2019s ability to advance any message selling its agenda) while the focus on taxes and health care functions as a persuasion tool for reaching swing voters. Particularly with working-class white women, whose votes were essential to Trump\u2019s 2016 victory, \u201chealth care is the tip of the spear\u201d for winning them back, Ferguson says. Indeed, when the Democratic group Democracy Corps on Monday released a memo on focus groups it recently conducted in blue-collar Macomb County, Michigan, it reported, \u201cIn every focus group we hear more and more about the crippling cost of health care, especially among the women.\u201d It\u2019s virtually certain that the repeal of the ACA\u2019s individual mandate and other changes Trump has imposed on the law will lead to significant increases in health insurance premiums later this year \u2013 a process that began, ironically, on the one-year anniversary of the repeal vote last Friday when two large insurers in Virginia proposed substantial hikes. That could benefit Democratic efforts to maintain focus on the Republican efforts to repeal the law; so will the promises from Republican candidates, such as Nevada Sen. Dean Heller and Pennsylvania Rep. Lou Barletta \u2013 who is seeking to unseat Democratic Sen. Bob Casey \u2013 that they will mount a renewed repeal effort if they maintain congressional control after November. Republicans open a risky new front in the immigration wars But the debate over the health care law, the tax bill and the relationship between them is far from settled for either side. Opinion on the tax plan itself has slipped into negative territory, but with unemployment plummeting, most voters still favor the GOP on the broader issue of promoting the economy. While the ACA now draws more support than opposition overall in the Kaiser survey, opinion remains slightly negative among white voters, at a time when college-educated white men and non-college white women loom as the most conflicted constituencies in the electorate. In the Pew polling, far more people in each of those two groups expressed negative than positive views about Trump\u2019s behavior; but nearly half in both said they agreed with him on most issues, according to detailed results provided by Pew. Most important, both groups learned toward the GOP when asked which party they intend to support in November. Such results bolster Cole\u2019s confidence that Democrats won\u2019t succeed in wielding the ACA vote against Republicans. \u201cI think it works with people you already have, but it doesn\u2019t convince people in the middle,\u201d he says. \u201cUntil we see tangible legislation and it moves through the process in some meaningful way, and I don\u2019t expect that through the end of the year.\u201d Hillary Clinton\u2019s failure to effectively dislodge Trump from his claim to champion working families proved to be perhaps the crucial messaging failure of her campaign. Now Democrats are making a second attempt at defining the Trump-era GOP as phony populists more committed to benefiting the wealthy and big business. That won\u2019t be easy while the economy is growing, and Trump is daily playing so many chords \u2013 from economic nationalism on trade to racially tinged populism on immigration and crime \u2013 that resonate with white working-class voters. Succeed or fail, the Democratic efforts against Republicans in Congress this fall will offer a revealing trial run for the much larger test looming for 2020: challenging the billionaire President\u2019s identity as a working-class hero.",

It is now the party of every American who wants government to stay out of their way and promote a great economy and keep us safe. We don\u2019t need handouts we need opportunity. @realDonaldTrump is doing that.\u201d Parscale then tweeted out a pic of Kasich with none other than Democratic House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, adding: \u201cIs it really hard to figure out who @JohnKasich is really with?

            "article_content": "Two recent polls indicating surprising Democratic strength in Senate races across the Southwest underscore how the parties\u2019 shifting demographic and geographic bases of support are widening the electoral battlefield. The surveys, which point to strong Democratic opportunities to capture Republican-held Senate seats in Arizona and Texas, might prove to be desert mirages by Election Day. But even the prospect of close Senate races in those ordinarily Republican-leaning states, shows how old political alignments are cracking as the parties build new coalitions of support. In that way, this fall\u2019s possible Democratic gains across the Southwest represent a kind of bookend to Donald Trump\u2019s Rust Belt breakthrough in 2016, when he narrowly captured three \u201cblue wall\u201d states that had voted Democratic in every presidential race since at least 1992: Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania. Each development suggests that after years in which the parties seemed to partition the country into impenetrable spheres of influence, more states may be within reach for both sides. And that could produce a more unpredictable politics that forces both parties to fight across a wider battlefield than either has usually faced in recent years. Flake: Not sure GOP will be \"Trump party\" in 2020 This volatility is rooted in the shifting basis of each side\u2019s electoral coalition. Beginning before Trump, but accelerating under him, Republicans have established a commanding edge among older, blue-collar, non-urban and evangelical whites. That advantage is strengthening the GOP\u2019s long-term position in Midwestern, Appalachian and Great Plains states that remain preponderantly white, heavily blue-collar and still largely dependent on manufacturing, resource-extraction and agriculture for jobs. Starting in the 1990s, but accelerating since Barack Obama\u2019s first election, Democrats, conversely, have grown increasingly reliant on a coalition of young people, minorities and college-educated, secular and single whites, especially women. That is slowly strengthening the party\u2019s position in Sun Belt states that are growing more racially diverse, and are also in many cases transitioning faster than the mostly-white heartland states into the post-industrial, information-age economy. Over the long term, these shifts will likely mean that Republicans win more elections than they do today across Rust Belt states such as Ohio, Iowa and Michigan, and Democrats will make deeper inroads across Sun Belt states from Georgia and North Carolina to Arizona and Nevada. But the effect today is very different. While these parallel changes are in midstream, they are creating a more competitive balance in both the Rust Belt and the Sun Belt. The result is that the 2018 midterm election and the 2020 presidential race will each likely produce a procession of closely contested races on both fronts. The 2016 presidential election offered a revealing snapshot of how the partisan balance is evolving in both the Sun Belt and Rust Belt. One way to measure the change is to compare the 2016 presidential outcomes in both groups of states to the results in 2008, when Obama won his sweeping first victory. The powerful pattern Democrats must break to win the Senate Obama won the popular vote over John McCain by a national margin of almost 7.3 percentage points. In 2016, Hillary Clinton beat Trump in the national popular vote by 2.1 percentage points. That means from the apex of 2008 through 2016, the Democratic margin in the national popular vote declined by about 5.2 percentage points. But the Democratic margin declined by much greater amounts across the Rust Belt. Obama, for instance, beat McCain in Iowa by 9.5 percentage points while Clinton lost it to Trump by a virtually mirror-image 9.4 points. That\u2019s a decline in margin for the Democrats of fully 19 percentage points, nearly four-times the national average. Using the same calculation, the Democratic margin from 2008 to 2016 declined by 17 points in Wisconsin, 14 in Michigan, 13 in Ohio and 11 in Pennsylvania. After Obama won all each of those states both times, Clinton lost all of them \u2013 with Trump squeezing out Michigan, Wisconsin and Pennsylvania by less than one percentage point each. And although Clinton narrowly preserved Minnesota, her margin there declined by nearly nine percentage points compared to Obama\u2019s. Nevada, where Clinton\u2019s margin was about 10 points less than Obama\u2019s, was the only contested Sun Belt state where Democrats lost so much ground since 2008. But in Colorado, North Carolina and Florida, her margin declined by about four percentage points, less than the national average (with Democrats holding the first and surrendering the latter two.) In Virginia, which Clinton comfortably carried, her margin fell by only one point from 2008. Clinton lost Georgia by almost exactly the same roughly five-percentage-point margin as Obama did in 2008. And she actually narrowed Obama\u2019s margin of defeat from 2008 by five points in Arizona and three points in Texas \u2013 over a period when the national popular vote margin, recall, had moved five points toward the GOP. These changes produced a significant number of relatively close states in both the Rust and Sun Belts. Trump won (in ascending order of margin) Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Florida, Arizona, North Carolina and Georgia, all by 5.1 percentage points or less; Clinton managed relatively competitive victories of 5.3 percentage points or less in Minnesota, Nevada, Colorado and Virginia. These shifts also produced a telling reordering of the states. Clinton lost Texas by a smaller margin than Iowa; only eight years earlier, the Democratic margin had been over 20 points better in Iowa than in Texas. She lost Arizona, Georgia and North Carolina by much less than she lost Ohio, after Obama had run much better in the Buckeye state than any of the other three. And she won Colorado and Virginia by more than she carried Minnesota after the reverse was true for Obama in 2008. Texas race isn't guaranteed Republican anymore The 2018 Senate elections will provide the next key gauge of these changes. In the southwest, Democrats are on the offense. In Nevada, Republican Sen. Dean Heller, who is facing Democratic Rep. Jacky Rosen, is considered the single most vulnerable GOP Senate incumbent. In Arizona, which is generally considered the second-best Democratic pickup opportunity, last week\u2019s ABC/15 OH Predictive Insights poll showed Democrat Kyrsten Sinema leading all three top competitors in the GOP Senate primary, including Rep. Martha McSally, the highly-touted favorite of the party establishment. All of the Republicans were weighed down by unhappiness with Trump: the poll found his approval among college-educated whites in the state had dipped below 40%, and they now preferred Simena over McSally by double-digits, a big improvement over the usual Democratic performance there. Even more surprising was the Quinnipiac University poll last week showing Texas Republican Sen. Ted Cruz leading Democrat Beto O\u2019Rourke by only a slim 47% to 44% margin. Democrats have had their expectations in Texas dashed often enough \u2013 most recently when Gov. Greg Abbot resoundingly beat Wendy Davis, the Democrats\u2019 highly touted gubernatorial nominee, in 2014 \u2013 to remain skeptical. But the Quinnipiac poll suggested that unease with Trump, whose approval rating had skidded to just 43%, may be creating the conditions for more competitive races in Texas. While Democrats have benefited from the state\u2019s growing diversity, they have struggled to make the inroads among college-educated whites that have boosted them elsewhere. The Quinnipiac Poll, though, showed that slightly over two-fifths of college-educated whites in Texas now disapproved of Trump and slightly under two-fifths said they would support O\u2019Rourke. If Democrats can sustain that white-collar support \u2013 after Clinton and Davis each carried less than one-third of those voters \u2013 they can likely keep Texas within reach, even if it remains tilted away from them. In the Rust Belt, it\u2019s Republicans on the offense this year. After Democrats in 2016 failed to oust Republican Senate incumbents in Wisconsin, Ohio and Pennsylvania, the GOP now is mounting major challenges against Democratic incumbents in Missouri, Indiana, North Dakota, West Virginia, Ohio, Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania. Trump\u2019s visceral connection with many working-class whites in those states creates risk for each of those Democrats. Yet Trump\u2019s slippage in these places relative to 2016 raises their odds of survival. In Pennsylvania, for instance, a Muhlenberg College poll showed Trump\u2019s approval rating sinking to 39%, and Democrat Bob Casey leading Republican Lou Barletta by double-digits. Among the non-college whites who keyed Trump\u2019s Pennsylvania victory in 2018, the president\u2019s approval rating had sagged to about even \u2013 and those voters, in turn split almost exactly in half between Casey and Barletta, according to figures provided by Christopher Borick, director of the Muhlenberg College Institute of Public Opinion. Among college-educated whites, who had split evenly between Trump and Clinton in the state, the president\u2019s disapproval rating now exceeded his approval by 23 percentage points; among those same voters, Casey, correspondingly, led Barletta by a crushing 19 points. The common theme across Sun Belt and Rust Belt is that the number of races that neither side can entirely take for granted this fall is surprisingly large. Beyond the closely contested Senate races, both sides are also bracing for tight gubernatorial contests in states from Nevada, Georgia and Florida, to Michigan, Wisconsin and Ohio. In 2020, the same could be true in the presidential race, with Georgia and Arizona (previously safe for the GOP) and Minnesota (reliably Democratic since the 1980s) likely joining the traditional list of roughly a dozen battleground states, and Texas not far behind. In geology, when tectonic plates shift, earthquakes follow. For the next several years, the same may be true in American politics.",

            "article_content": "The Rev. Al Sharpton\u200b may have very well introduced the next Democratic nominee\u200b when he welcomed a quintet of potential 2020 primary contenders to chilly New York City \u200bfor a \u201ctemperature tour,\u201d as the host put it, on Friday, ahead of what\u2019s expected to be a hot and crowded nominating contest. Mostly absent from the menu, though, as the five-star speakers chewed through their political visions on the third day of the National Action Network\u2019s 2018 convention, was talk of President Donald Trump. While Washington veers between agony and delight at the latest twist in his soap operatic presidency, the speakers in Midtown Manhattan kept clear of all things Stormy Daniels, James Comey and Michael Cohen. New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker closed the bill of potential 2020 contenders, following his colleagues Sens. Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris, Bernie Sanders and Kirsten Gillibrand, with an explanation they all might have signed on for. \u201cI want you all to notice something,\u201d Booker told the lunchtime audience. \u201cI\u2019m just closing up on my remarks and I haven\u2019t mentioned Donald Trump at all. Why do I say that? Because it\u2019s not about him. It\u2019s about us and our problems and issues and challenges in this country did not start with Donald Trump.\u201d The liberal and progressive energy that has risen up to meet Trump, Booker added, existed \u2013 or should have \u2013 before the 2016 election. Now, he said, \u201cI am tired of people allowing someone who preaches hate to turn us into haters.\u201d Harris went a step further. Refusing to mention Trump by name, she placed controversial White House policies and rhetoric ahead of his smothering personal style, then cast him in glaring opposition to past Oval Office occupants. \u201cPresidents of our country (in the 1960s) talked about, and I\u2019m going to quote, \u2018the New Frontier.\u2019 They talked about, I quote, \u2018a Great Society,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cBy contrast, in the last 15 months, we hear phrases like, I quote, \u2018American carnage\u2019 and a phrase that disparaged an entire continent of people with words I will not repeat here.\u201d She turned, then, to the question Trump posed repeatedly on the campaign trail in 2016, when he asked black voters \u2013 like so many in the audience at the NAN convention, \u201cWhat do you have to lose?\u201d Reeling off a litany of controversial administration words and actions, like the recent suggestion by Trump that federal funding for historically black colleges and universities could be unconstitutional, Harris paused, meeting the groaning room as if sharing a personal aside: \u201cThis is what I get to see because I\u2019m in DC,\u201d she said, \u201cso I see it up close. I just came to share. These are notes from the field.\u201d Gillibrand followed suit with what she presented as a studied warning to the Democratic Party more broadly, telling it \u201cin the most absolute terms, that we should not court that hate for our own electoral survival, but we must shine a light on it for our moral survival.\u201d The New York senator rounded out her program by offering, like Booker and Warren, some scripture and, all alone, positing the creation of \u201ca universal jobs program.\u201d Before turning over the stage to Gillibrand and Booker, Sharpton went a step further in making plain the purpose \u2013 one of them, at least \u2013 of the coming speeches. \u201cOne of the reasons that we\u2019ve had the presidential candidates come through is because we wanted to have them address the specifics that we deal with in our community,\u201d he said. \u201cNow, none (from this year\u2019s group) have announced. They\u2019re on what we call a \u2018temperature tour\u2019 \u2013 they\u2019re trying to test the temperature to see if they should announce.\u201d Gauged if only by response in the rooms, all five will leave New York with ambitions at a boil. Sharpton provided each senator with thorough, warm introductions and all were, from the moment they began their strolls to the dais, welcomed by cheers and a swarm of amateur photographers. \u201cPresident Harris in the house!\u201d greeted the California senator and Sanders\u2019 arrival inspired one onlooker to turn and holler, \u201cFeelin\u2019 the Bern!\u201d For Sanders, it was his second time in front of a predominantly black audience in less than 16 hours. On Thursday night, he joined with the Rev. William Barber II, co-founder of the new \u201cPoor People\u2019s Campaign,\u201d at the Duke University Chapel in Durham, North Carolina, for a discussion on how to build a \u201cmoral economy.\u201d Both at Duke and in New York, Sanders turned to the Martin Luther King Jr.\u2019s April 1967 speech on the Vietnam War. One of the most controversial and politically radical of his public life, King at the Riverside Church on Manhattan\u2019s Upper West Side condemned American aggression in the region and tied it back to \u201cthe giant triplets of racism, extreme materialism, and militarism.\u201d Sanders channeled that message on Friday, describing King as something more than a Civil Rights leader \u2013 \u201ca nonviolent revolutionary who wanted to see our nation undergo a revolution of values\u201d against those \u201ctriple evils.\u201d Meanwhile, the Vermont independent delivered a searing, if familiar, criticism of White House policy and the President\u2019s politics, but sough to avoid any protracted commentary on Trump, the tabloid character. \u201cToo much attention is given to sensational issues like Stormy Daniels, or who Trump fired yesterday, or the latest tweet that he sent out today,\u201d Sanders said, rapping the media for its priorities in coverage. \u201cAnd they are not talking about the broad issues that impact tens of millions of Americans.\u201d The sentiment seemed to run deep, along with a similar frustration, up in New York. During a talk about gun safety after Warren\u2019s speech, Minister Kirsten John Foy drew applause when he asked people to look away from the scene in Washington, where \u201ca moron tweets every hour about some irrelevancy,\u201d and refocus on states, cities and smaller communities. Still, Sharpton couldn\u2019t resist defending Warren from a familiar Trump insult as he warmed up the early arrivals ahead of her remarks. \u201cShe\u2019s derided by the President because she stands up for all of us,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can judge your friends by who their enemies are. And he tries to deride her, calling her \u2018Pocahontas.\u2019 But to us, she\u2019s Sister Po Po.\u201d With that, Warren took the mic and, unlike her colleagues, mostly focused on a single issue: home ownership. She began by discussing her own family\u2019s struggles to hold on to their house, then crossed over to a flowing historical analysis of racist housing policy and its legacy \u2013 the decimation of black working class wealth. \u201cI\u2019m not here to tell you that housing discrimination is any more important or any less important than any other issue facing black America today,\u201d Warren concluded. \u201cI know I haven\u2019t personally experienced the struggles of African-American families, but I am here to say that no one can ignore what is happening in this country.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Red pockets. Romneyland. Blue-collar blues. Those labels describe the three groups of seats in the House of Representatives that will likely determine control of the chamber in November\u2019s midterm election. Virtually all analysts in both parties agree that the epicenter of vulnerability for the House Republican majority is in what could be called red pockets: These are the predominantly white-collar suburban seats the GOP still holds in big metropolitan areas that are otherwise solidly Democratic. Those include places such as Orange County, California; New Jersey; Miami; and suburbs outside of New York City, Chicago, Denver, Philadelphia and Minneapolis. But even if Democrats make big gains in those districts, there aren\u2019t quite enough of them to provide the party with the net gain of 24 seats it needs to recapture the House. That means House Democrats would also need to make inroads into the two other large groups of vulnerable GOP seats. One is what I call Romneyland: white-collar suburban seats in purple and even red states where Mitt Romney, the 2012 Republican presidential nominee, almost universally performed better than Donald Trump did in 2016. CNN Key Races: Strong fundraising shifts several House races in Democrats\u2019 favor The third are the \u201cblue-collar blues\u201d: mostly blue-collar, non-urban seats in blue states, where Trump almost without exception improved on Romney\u2019s performance. More distantly, the Democrats are also eyeing a few Republican-held blue-collar seats in purple and Republican-leaning states. But control of the House will likely turn on how the battle between the parties turns in the red pockets, Romneyland and the blue-collar blues. The red pockets will likely be the most reliable source of gains for Democrats because they compound two sources of Republican vulnerability: They are white-collar districts in areas with large numbers of Democrats, who appear motivated to turn out at higher-than-usual levels next fall. The big question is how far Democrats can reach into places where only one of those advantages is present: white-collar seats in traditionally Republican-leaning areas, or seats in Democratic states that are more rural and blue-collar. Intel chiefs: Russia targeting 2018 elections This battlefield reflects the long-term trends that have seen Democrats demonstrate increasing strength up and down the ballot in diverse, heavily college-educated, major metropolitan areas \u2013 even in Republican-leaning states. In parallel, Republicans have established dominant control over preponderantly white non-metro and blue-collar areas, even in otherwise Democratic-leaning states. All of these trends have accelerated under Trump. Amid improving attitudes toward the Republican tax bill, several recent polls have shown a small but measurable uptick in President Trump\u2019s job approval rating and a narrowing into the mid-single digits of the previously double-digit advantage Democrats have held in the \u201cgeneric\u201d ballot test of preferences for 2018. But even with those shifts, polls still consistently find a deeply polarized electorate. Trump and the GOP retain solid support among white men without college degrees, if slightly less than they attracted in 2016. But they are facing intense resistance from younger and non-white voters \u2013 especially African-Americans \u2013 and much lower numbers than usual among college-educated whites, especially, but not exclusively, women. Republicans are suddenly more optimistic about the midterms White women without a college education, whose support was critical to Trump\u2019s 2016 victory, loom as a wild card: Polls find they have cooled on him, but Democrats still face many obstacles with them. These diverging demographic attitudes shape the geography of the 2018 battlefield. The clearest opportunity for Democrats is the relatively few remaining Republican-held districts in blue metro areas with large populations of college-educated whites, and in many cases substantial minority and youth populations as well. These are places crowded with voters who tilt toward liberal positions on social issues and recoil from Trump\u2019s volatile persona, particularly the way he talks about race. The renewed visibility of gun control issues after the horrific Parkland, Florida, massacre could provide Democrats another lever in these districts, since the Republicans in them have almost universally voted with the National Rifle Association to loosen gun regulations in recent years. These \u201cred pockets\u201d include the four seats Republicans control in Orange County \u2013 the districts held by Mimi Walters and Dana Rohrabacher and the open seats that will be vacated by Darrell Issa and Ed Royce \u2013 as well as their sole remaining seat in Los Angeles County, held by Steve Knight. Others that fit this description include the seats in the western Chicago suburbs held by Republican Peter Roskam and in the eastern Denver suburbs held by Mike Coffman; the three suburban Philadelphia seats held by Ryan Costello, Mike Fitzpatrick and Pat Meehan (who has announced he will not seek re-election amid a sex scandal); the northern Virginia seat held by Barbara Comstock; two open seats in New Jersey as well as the one defended by Rep. Leonard Lance; Lee Zeldin\u2019s seat in eastern Long Island; the suburban Minneapolis seats now held by Jason Lewis and Erik Paulsen; the Seattle-area seat that Dave Reichert is leaving; as well as the Miami-area seat being vacated by Ileana Ros-Lehtinen and the nearby seat held by Rep. Carlos Curbelo. Missouri Democrat wins district won by Trump Though Romney carried many of these seats \u2013 often narrowly \u2013 in 2012, Hillary Clinton won all of those listed above in 2016 except for the seats held by Lewis and Fitzpatrick, which Trump won by eyelash margins, and Zeldin\u2019s, which Trump won more comfortably. These resemble the places where Democrats showed the most dramatic gains in 2017, for instance in their sweep of legislative seats and the huge margins they generated in the governor\u2019s race in northern Virginia. Compounding the GOP\u2019s vulnerability, the new congressional map the Pennsylvania Supreme Court issued Monday, after earlier ruling that the current district lines represented an impermissible gerrymander, strengthened the Democrats\u2019 hand in all three suburban Philadelphia seats. For Republicans, the key in these booming districts will be whether the good economy helps them recapture voters recoiling from Trump\u2019s personal behavior. One complication is these blue-state upper-middle-class suburbs are among the most likely losers from the GOP tax plan, which limits the deductibility of mortgage interest and state and local taxes. Democrats are highly unlikely to win back the House without maximizing their gains in the red pockets. The next bucket of seats is demographically similar to the red pockets but politically distinct because they are in metro areas that lean much more reliably toward the GOP. I call this group of seats Romneyland because they are filled with voters who resemble Romney demographically and ideologically: professionals and corporate middle managers who want a president who will shrink government and even pursue a center-right social agenda, but also exude professionalism and decorum. There is a wave of Republicans leaving Congress, updated again Romney won virtually every seat in this category in 2012. In 2016, Trump lost ground relative to Romney in almost all of them, though the residual Republican strength was great enough that he still carried many, albeit often narrowly. The districts in this bucket include the Omaha-area seat held by Don Bacon; the seats in suburban Houston and outside Dallas held by John Culberson and Pete Sessions, respectively; the two suburban Atlanta seats held by Karen Handel and Rob Woodall; David Young\u2019s seat outside Des Moines; the Tucson-area seat Martha McSally is vacating to run for the Senate from Arizona; the Lexington, Kentucky-area seat held by Andy Barr; the seats outside Detroit that Dave Trott is vacating and Mike Bishop is defending; and Kevin Yoder\u2019s seat in suburban Kansas City, Kansas. These seats are not immune from the forces threatening the Republicans in the red pockets: Handel, for instance, only narrowly survived last June\u2019s special election in Georgia, though her predecessor Tom Price had carried over 60% of the vote there as recently as 2016. But as Handel\u2019s slim victory over Democrat Jon Ossoff showed, Republicans have more of a cushion in these places than in the red pockets. That\u2019s partly because more of the white-collar whites in them are social conservatives than their counterparts in the Democratic-leaning metro areas. The third key test for Democrats is the districts I call \u201cblue-collar blues.\u201d These are the blue-collar, exurban, small town and rural seats in states that generally lean Democratic. These include Republican seats held by John Faso, John Katko and Claudia Tenney in upstate New York; Mike Bost, Rodney Davis and Randy Hultgren in downstate Illinois; the northeast Iowa seat of Rod Blum; Bruce Poliquin\u2019s northern Maine district; and the Central Valley, California, seats of Jeff Denham and David Valadao. Dems flip deep-red Missouri state House seat These seats present an especially revealing test for Democrats. Former President Barack Obama carried almost all of them at least once and many of them have elected Democratic House members in the recent past. But House Democrats were routed in these places in the 2010 and 2014 midterm elections under Obama, and almost all of these districts turned further toward Trump in 2016. The 2017 results in Virginia and Alabama showed Democrats almost completely failing to crack the GOP\u2019s hold on blue-collar and rural voters. But some Democrats argue that terrain is much tougher for the party in the South than in the Northeastern and Midwestern states where these competitive House seats are concentrated. Democrats see an opening in polling, such as the 2017 average of Gallup\u2019s daily approval ratings for Trump, that shows a significant erosion in his support across the Rust Belt among working-class white women, even as he remains very strong among blue-collar white men. Converting that female disillusionment with Trump into votes for Democratic congressional candidates is likely the key to seriously contesting the \u201cblue-collar blue\u201d seats. National Democrats stay on the sidelines in close Pennsylvania House special election One early test will be March\u2019s special election in the heavily blue-collar southwestern Pennsylvania district that Republican Rep. Tim Murphy has vacated: Democrat Conor Lamb, a former Marine, is running competitively against Republican state Rep. Rick Saccone in a district Trump carried by nearly 20 percentage points. Beyond the top-tier targets in the red pockets, there\u2019s a spirited behind-the-scenes debate among Democratic strategists about which of the remaining two buckets of seats represents the party\u2019s best opportunity in 2018. Some focus most on winning back working-class voters in blue states, who have a recent history of voting for the party but are more favorable to Trump. Others see more opportunity to convert white-collar suburbanites in red states, who have a longer history of voting Republican but are also more disaffected from the President. To recapture the House, Democrats will likely need to do a considerable amount of both.

            "article_content": "California Republican Rep. Duncan Hunter\u2019s devil-may-care attitude has been a good fit for parts of his rural and suburban San Diego County district for about a decade, matching the Wild West ethos and anti-government bent of his constituents. Some voters found it amusing when Hunter exhaled plumes of smoke from his vape pen during two congressional committee hearings to protest a proposed ban on e-cigarettes on planes. They shrugged off the eye-popping bar tabs that appeared on his past Federal Election Commission filings. When the congressman, who was one of the first House members to endorse then-presidential candidate Donald Trump, made the aggressive suggestion that the US should pre-emptively strike North Korea, it was excused by some voters as the blunt talk of a hard-charging former Marine. But in a year when control of the US House of Representatives could come down to one seat, it\u2019s evident from two dozen interviews here that there is growing unease among Republican voters about Hunter and the Department of Justice investigation into his campaign spending, which has stretched for more than a year. The California secretary of state has now certified the list of candidates for the June 5 primary, meaning that if Hunter were indicted in the middle of this election year, the only path for another well-known Republican \u2013 such as retiring Rep. Darrell Issa \u2013 to replace him would be a write-in candidacy, according to state officials. Even if Hunter were to resign, the only way to remove his name from the ballot would be a court order. The five-term congressman maintains his innocence. His aides and his lawyers did not respond to repeated requests for comment about the allegations for this story. He has reimbursed his campaign account more than $60,000 since the FEC first questioned spending on video games in 2016, according to FEC records. \u201cThere was wrong campaign spending, but it was not done by me,\u201d Hunter recently told local TV station KGTV-10News. His comments have put the spotlight on his wife and former campaign manager, Margaret Hunter, who also held and made charges on the campaign credit card. He told the San Diego Union-Tribune in April 2016 that he and his wife were the only holders of the credit card. At that time, he said he would be the only one to use the credit card in the future. Retirement watch: 3 groups of House Republicans whose exits would shake up the 2018 map The cloud of suspicion around Hunter, and the huge amount that he\u2019s been forced to spend on legal bills, has buoyed Democratic hopes in the 50th District, even though Trump trounced Hillary Clinton here by 15 points. Hunter\u2019s two most formidable Democratic challengers \u2013 former Navy SEAL Josh Butner and Ammar Campa-Najjar, who was a Department of Labor aide in the Obama administration \u2013 believe Hunter\u2019s legal entanglements, the growth of the Latino population here and the influx of younger military families have changed the calculus. \u201cIn Hunter, you have a career politician who\u2019s been in a seat that was more or less handed to him by his father,\u201d Butner told CNN recently over coffee, referring to the elder Duncan Hunter, who was in Congress for nearly three decades. \u201cI have a sense of service to put my country ahead of any party, or any personal profit or special interest. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the case with him.\u201d Butner, who spent 23 years in the US Navy, including combat deployments in Somalia, Iraq and Afghanistan, argued that the mere fact that Hunter is under federal investigation should give voters pause. \u201cAs a sitting congressman, if you\u2019ve gotten yourself into that situation, that\u2019s not a good thing,\u201d Butner said. \u201cThe lowest form of leadership is example. That\u2019s the starting point. Lead by example \u2013 if you can do nothing else \u2013 and he\u2019s not even doing that.\u201d Hunter\u2019s troubles have led strong Republican voters like Robert Luitjens, an 85-year-old Navy veteran from Escondido, to give the Democratic candidates a second look and others to say they may stay home in November. Luitjens said he is particularly dismayed by Hunter\u2019s conduct, because he wants Republicans to maintain control of the House this year. \u201cIt bothers me that he\u2019s gotten himself into this position,\u201d Luitjens said, adding that he\u2019s tried to withhold judgment until the probe is complete. While Hunter has \u201crepresented his district well\u201d \u2013 like his father before him, Luitjens said \u2013 \u201cI think he\u2019s done some stupid things.\u201d \u201cYou don\u2019t use the wrong credit card to do personal things,\u201d the Navy veteran said, referring to Hunter\u2019s initial explanations that his son had used the wrong card to pay for video games. \u201cI know he claims his wife misused it; and one of his kids misused the credit card because they looked alike. But you should have control over those kinds of things. That bothers me.\u201d Other voters are less forgiving of Hunter\u2019s conduct. \u201cI think it\u2019s disgraceful if the allegations are true. If I did that in my job, they\u2019d fire me,\u201d said Republican voter Gil Hernandez, 61, during an interview at a hardware store in Santee. \u201cI supported his dad; I supported him, but if everything comes down to where he\u2019s spending money the way he shouldn\u2019t, and if he\u2019s had this moral lapse, yeah, I think he should be removed. Should another Republican fill his place? Yes.\u201d \u201cI feel for his wife and I feel for his children \u2013 if those allegations are true,\u201d Hernandez added. \u201cBut he was in the military. The guy should have known better. \u2026 If you\u2019re a military guy, you\u2019d think you\u2019d have more discipline, more self-control.\u201d While Hunter\u2019s conduct has provided an opening with voters, Campa-Najjar says he has tried to focus on Hunter\u2019s hard-right, pro-Trump message, which he believes is out of step with the new crop of voters in the district. The 30-year-old Latino-Arab candidate says his own working-class background will have greater resonance with voters. \u201cI\u2019m not concerned about his misuse of campaign funds,\u201d said Campa-Najjar, who worked as a janitor while he was in school and served as a White House intern helping to select the constituent letters that President Barack Obama would read. \u201cI\u2019m concerned about his use of taxpayer funds.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t think the message needs to be: \u2018He\u2019s corrupt, and have you seen the other guy?\u2019 I really don\u2019t like that message,\u201d Campa-Najjar said. He points to demographic shifts and the push to register Democrats in the 50th District \u2013 including on six campuses throughout the district \u2013 as a reason for Democratic optimism. \u201cKamala Harris won this district when she ran for Senate, so a biracial progressive has won this district before,\u201d he said. \u201cThen there is the reality on the ground that every day there\u2019s young couples, mixed families like mine, single mothers like mine \u2013 they\u2019re all leaving San Diego because of gentrification in parts of the county that used to be affordable. \u2026 They are leaving to go to East County and North County. And all those demographics I just described \u2013 they are all Democrats.\u201d Campa-Najjar says he\u2019s not running \u201cto be the brown candidate,\u201d but rather as an advocate for middle class values. He cited Hunter\u2019s support for the President\u2019s tax reform plan, which the congressman acknowledged would hurt some California voters in his district, as an example of how he believes Hunter is favoring party over his constituents. Still, the secretary of state\u2019s report at the beginning of this year illustrates the steep climb Campa-Najjar and Butner will face: Forty-two percent of the district\u2019s voters were Republican; 27% Democratic. The 50th District stretches across eastern San Diego County from a portion of Temecula in Riverside County south to the ranch country below Rancho San Diego into the mountainous terrain around Alpine, where Hunter lives. The median household income here is $71,692. Some 93% of families make less than $200,000. Veterans compromise about 10% of the voting age population, according to census data. Will tax cuts save Republicans in 2018? Hunter, 42, who worked as a business analyst after graduating from San Diego State University, quit his job after the September 11, 2001, terror attacks to join the Marines. He was elected in 2008 after serving in combat in Iraq and Afghanistan. His wife, Margaret, managed his campaign when he was called back up and deployed to Afghanistan in 2007. The five-term congressman has said he is the subject of \u201cslanderous, salacious\u201d attacks within the press. He has also played on suggestions that the Justice Department is slanted against Republicans, by alluding to special prosecutor Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation of the Trump administration. \u201cI have trust in the justice system despite what\u2019s going on with Trump and Mueller, and the anti-Republican, pro-Democrat forces within the Department of Justice, at the highest levels, and the FBI,\u201d he recently told KGTV-10News, when asked about the allegations that he had misused campaign funds. \u201cI\u2019m optimistic on the outcome. \u2026 It\u2019s been a year. That\u2019s a long time.\u201d Republican operatives privately express frustration about the length of the probe, which began in 2016 when the FEC and the San Diego Union-Tribune questioned 68 charges on video games. There were also campaign charges for vacations in Italy and Disneyland, dental bills, clothing purchases and unspecified items from a surf shop. A Hunter staffer explained to the Press-Enterprise newspaper that one $600 charge for \u201cin cabin rabbit transport fees\u201d was an accidental charge related to air travel by the family\u2019s pet rabbit. A March 2017 search warrant showed that the FBI had searched the offices of Hunter\u2019s campaign treasurer in Alexandria, Virginia, seizing computers, documents and hard drives. Documents showed authorities were seeking any communication about disbursements between Hunter, his wife, several aides and the two employees at the firm that handled the books. The document retrieved by CNN from PACER later disappeared from public view, signaling that proceedings had moved on to a grand jury investigation. The House Ethics Committee\u2019s recent announcement that it would continue to defer to the Justice Department probe into whether Hunter had used campaign funds for personal expenses was viewed by California GOP officials as one more sign that charges could be coming soon.",

Carlos Curbelo of Florida tweeted it\u2019s \u201ctime for him to resign or for @POTUS to dismiss him.\u201d Curbelo, who represents part of South Florida, is running for re-election in one of the most competitive districts in the country and has been critical of President Donald Trump and his administration in the past. Major policy differences aside, @EPAScottPruitt\u2018s corruption scandals are an embarrassment to the Administration, and his conduct is grossly disrespectful to American taxpayers. It's time for him to resign or for @POTUS to dismiss him. https://t.co/gXWLDffqam Shortly after Curbelo\u2019s statement was tweeted, Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen told CNN she supports his message. \u201cI agree with my colleague, Carlos, that the EPA administrator should resign,\u201d said Ros-Lehtinen, who is not seeking re-election. \u201cWhen scandals and distractions overtake a public servant\u2019s ability to function effectively, another person should fill that role.\u201d While both are Republicans, the two Florida lawmakers have previously broken with the Trump administration for their handling of climate change issues, and Ros-Lehtinen criticized Pruitt\u2019s handling of climate change over the past year. Pruitt\u2019s renting scandal comes amid other recent controversies, including his use of 24-hour security on vacations and his use of first-class travel. The swirling scandals have caused headaches for White House aides, and after Trump recently fired former Veterans Affairs Secretary David Shulkin, as well as other Cabinet members and top administration officials in the past year, it\u2019s unclear where Pruitt\u2019s future stands. The White House is \u201clooking into\u201d Pruitt\u2019s housing situation, a person familiar with the matter told CNN on Monday. Trump, when asked Tuesday if he supports Pruitt, gave little indication of whether he is bothered by the recent spate of headlines. \u201cI hope he\u2019s going to be great,\u201d\u00a0Trump\u00a0said, failing to give a full-throated endorsement of\u00a0Pruitt. Responding to reports about Pruitt\u2019s shaky footing with the President, EPA spokesman Jahan Wilcox said in a statement, \u201cFrom advocating to leave the Paris Accord, working to repeal Obama\u2019s Clean Power Plan and WOTUS, and cleaning up toxic Superfund sites that have been languishing for decades, Administrator Pruitt is focused on advancing President Trump\u2019s agenda of regulatory certainty and environmental stewardship.\u201d CNN\u2019s Dan Merica, Kevin Liptak, Jim Acosta and Sophie Tatum contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Former Vice President Joe Biden was back on Capitol Hill meeting with Democrats on Wednesday ahead of the midterm elections, attempting to bridge a divide in his party between progressives and blue-collar voters. Biden, repeating an argument he\u2019s been making of late, said there should be \u201cno reason for any conflict\u201d between the two wings of the party. \u201cThere\u2019s no distinction in the Democratic Party between our social agenda and our agenda in terms of the economy,\u201d he told reporters. Biden met with the \u201cBlue Collar Caucus\u201d for close to an hour. While House members said there was no discussion of the former vice president as a potential 2020 presidential candidate, some members asked him to campaign for them on the 2018 trail. \u201cOne-hundred percent of any of the campaign questions were focused on 2018,\u201d Rep. Brendan Boyle, a Pennsylvania Democrat, told reporters after the session. RELATED: Joe Biden campaigns for a blue-collar Democratic resurgence in Pennsylvania The group was founded after the 2016 election when Boyle and Democratic Rep. Marc Veasey of Texas grew concerned that some in their party were willing to write off the working-class vote. Biden says he would 'beat the hell' out of Trump if in high school The former vice president\u2019s visit comes two weeks after he stumped for Democrat Conor Lamb in the House special election in western Pennsylvania \u2013 a district that Donald Trump won by 20 points in 2016. Lamb is poised to win the race in an upset victory, further fueling Democratic hopes of a blue wave in November, especially in red-leaning districts. (The election happened last week, but Republican candidate Rick Saccone has not yet conceded, and Republicans are looking at challenging the results.) Boyle warned that failing to reach out to blue-collar workers \u201cwould be a terrible mistake.\u201d He added that \u201ca majority is built upon having a broader based coalition, that we can win these voters back, just like they voted for Barack Obama twice in my state of Pennsylvania and in a number of other states and I think from November 2016 to now fortunately we\u2019ve had a couple of successes to point to to kind of prove that.\u201d Lamb also visited Washington on Wednesday, and talked to House Democrats about his campaign\u2019s message. \u201cHe was the rock star of the hour, \u201d Veasey said. Biden previously came to the Hill in February to speak with House Democrats about unifying the party and delivered a blistering speech criticizing President Donald Trump.",

            "article_content": "\u201cOnly in New York, kids, only in New York.\u201d Tabloid gossip queen Cindy Adams\u2019 signature signoff is the best on-ramp to these frenzied early days of the New York Democratic gubernatorial primary. The actress and activist Cynthia Nixon\u2019s decision to enter the race, challenging two-term Gov. Andrew Cuomo, has touched off the kind of pitched political battle that many in the state, as recently as a couple of weeks ago, seemed confident belonged exclusively to Cuomo and New York Mayor Bill de Blasio, the perpetually warring liberal leaders. But the stakes are different and perhaps higher in certain quarters with Cuomo\u2019s potential presidential ambitions, along with his current job, on the line. Unlike de Blasio, Nixon has nothing to lose by torching the governor with every breath, especially in the five boroughs, where the troubled subway system \u2013 which is controlled by the state \u2013 is in a rolling crisis. All of which provided a neat setup for Nixon\u2019s campaign kickoff speech Tuesday in Brooklyn, an event to which she was nearly late. Why? Subway trouble, of course. Too on the nose? Not in New York these days, where solidarity, and steaming fulmination, are only a mystery delay away. Upon arrival at the small event, she briefed the room on her travels. \u201cI got here just in the nick of time. I allowed an hour and a half for what should have been a 30-minute ride,\u201d Nixon said, pausing a beat as the audience chuckled, then deadpanning: \u201cCuomo\u2019s MTA.\u201d Nixon\u2019s campaign website also gives the transit mess top billing. There are five links across the front of the homepage, appearing in this order: \u201cMeet Cynthia,\u201d \u201c#CuomosMTA,\u201d \u201cWhy I\u2019m Running,\u201d \u201cVolunteer\u201d and \u201cDonate.\u201d The MTA, or Metropolitan Transportation Authority, is the agency that runs the subway. It's not all that crazy to think Cynthia Nixon could be the next New York governor Just below, beneath her first ad, is a declaration sure to delight lefty activists, and not just in the local haunts. \u201cWe need a New York that works for all of us,\u201d it reads, \u201ca New York for the many, not just the few.\u201d Those last few words \u2013 purposefully or not \u2013 track closely with the rallying cry for Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s UK Labour Party, whose election slogan is, \u201cFor the many, not the few.\u201d For those less attuned to (or interested in) such progressive deep tracks, or the latest skirmishes inside the New York Democratic political scene, there has been plenty of more baroque early stage drama. Nixon, of course, is still best known for her role in another Big Apple talker, the long-running HBO series \u201cSex and the City.\u201d The early pushback on her candidacy has focused more on her celebrity, and lack of experience in government, than any broad policy points. When asked weeks ago about rumors Nixon might run (and who, if anyone, might be pushing her to do it), Cuomo offered a cheeky preview of the early criticism. \u201cIt was either the mayor of New York or Vladimir Putin,\u201d he joked. \u201cNormally name recognition is relevant when it has some connection to the endeavor. If it\u2019s just about name recognition, then I\u2019m hoping Brad Pitt, Angelina Jolie and Billy Joel don\u2019t get into the race.\u201d But the laughter has died down a bit over the last couple of days. Despite early polling that shows Cuomo more than tripling Nixon\u2019s support and the reality that, even as voters become better acquainted with her pitch, she faces an uphill battle against a popular and accomplished incumbent, Cuomo allies have circled the wagons. On Tuesday, New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand endorsed Cuomo, the word first landing with the New York Daily News, a city tabloid. \u201cKirsten is a friend of Governor Cuomo\u2019s and supports his campaign,\u201d her spokesman, Glen Caplin, told the News. \u201cHe\u2019s been a leader on issues she cares deeply about like marriage equality, paid family leave and campus sexual assault to name a few.\u201d But the headlines on Tuesday night mostly belonged to former City Council speaker Christine Quinn, who finished third in the 2013 Democratic mayoral primary won by de Blasio. In an interview with the New York Post, Quinn sought to deliver a striking blow \u2013 and she did, though not with the intended results. \u201cCynthia Nixon was opposed to having a qualified lesbian become mayor of New York City,\u201d she said, speaking of her own run. \u201cNow she wants an unqualified lesbian to be the governor of New York.\u201d The second reference there, for the uninitiated, is to Nixon, who has identified as bisexual and is married to a woman. Quinn has since apologized for her choice of words, but not the underlying message. \u201cCynthia Nixon aggressively opposed my candidacy in New York despite my qualifications for the office and despite my strong progressive credentials,\u201d she said in a tweet, the third of four intended to defuse the controversy. \u201cI was attempting to make a comparison between the two of us.\u201d For her part, Nixon has embraced the storm, sending out a fundraising email on Wednesday afternoon with the subject line, \u201cAn unqualified lesbian.\u201d Quinn isn\u2019t named; the words are attributed instead to \u201cone of Andrew Cuomo\u2019s top surrogates.\u201d Here's exactly how much trouble Cynthia Nixon can cause for Andrew Cuomo A few hours earlier, Nixon had touted a campaign launch party with a tweet inviting \u201call qualified and unqualified lesbians and everyone who wants funded schools, affordable housing & working subways.\u201d Nixon\u2019s active social media presence has helped grab still more attention. (Not that New York, with its voracious media, was ever going to pass up such a juicy narrative.) On Tuesday evening, Brooklyn Borough President Eric Adams publicly offered the new candidate a guided \u201ctour\u201d of a New York City Housing Authority development and an opportunity to \u201chear directly from #tenants who\u2019ve lived through years of government neglect, caught in the endless back-and-forth between Albany lawmakers.\u201d Nixon accepted less than 30 minutes later. The message was clear enough in context: Cuomo himself recently visited with such tenants up in the Bronx and East Harlem, at the invitation of activists, and with cameras in tow reviewed the crumbling apartment spaces before lashing out at the housing authority and the city and pledging emergency assistance. Now, at Adams\u2019 invitation, Nixon will have the opportunity to show up and, as much as any candidate can, match the sitting governor. If Nixon\u2019s appeals to date seem focused on the city, that\u2019s because they are a new kind of \u201csouthern strategy,\u201d you might say. Her path to a primary upset requires that she outperform the progressive law professor Zephyr Teachout \u2013 who challenged Cuomo in 2014 (losing out with about a third of the vote) and is now signed on as her campaign treasurer \u2013 with city voters, especially in minority communities, where the governor has a strong foothold. The focus on the subway makes sense, then \u2013 it\u2019s the working class that struggles most when it fails \u2013 and by centering the state\u2019s role in its failure, Nixon could elevate her standing there come September, after what promises to be a long, hot summer of delays. But that\u2019s all a long way off. Next up is Thursday: Day 3.",

            "article_content": "As Republicans gear up for a tough midterm election year, party leaders are pointing to their success in passing the tax overhaul last year as the key to preventing a Democratic wave in November. Some are even suggesting a second round of cuts. But if tax cuts are a winning message, the evidence so far is mixed. And Democrats are determined to turn Republicans\u2019 signature legislative achievement against them, framing it as a giveaway to the wealthy that will threaten Medicare and Social Security. At a meeting last week following Republicans\u2019 defeat in a Pennsylvania special election, House Speaker Paul Ryan emphasized the importance of campaigning on the tax law. Rep. Steve Stivers, head of the National Republican Congressional Committee, told members that despite the difficult political environment, it was possible to hold the majority, especially if the GOP effectively sells the tax overhaul, the party\u2019s singular legislative achievement. Corry Bliss, who heads two major GOP groups \u2013 the nonprofit, issue-oriented American Action Network and the political action committee Congressional Leadership Fund \u2013 put it this way last week: \u201cAnswer this question and I will tell you if we keep the House or not. In 10 months, does the middle class think we cut their taxes? Every member of the Republican Party should be spending all of their time selling the tax plan. Everything else is a waste of time and money.\u201d But in Pennsylvania\u2019s 18th District \u2013 where Democrats swung the race 20 points from 2016 \u2013 Republicans moved away from tax cuts in the final days of the campaign and focused instead on issues like crime and sanctuary cities \u2013 a sign that taxes were not the effective message that party leaders hoped it would be. The Republican there, Rick Saccone, embraced the tax cuts during the campaign, saying in a debate that they\u2019re \u201cnot the \u2018crumbs\u2019 that Nancy Pelosi and her crew on the left say,\u201d and that \u201cpeople are very happy to have the bonuses that they received.\u201d Democrat Conor Lamb campaigned against them, calling the overhaul a \u201cgiveaway\u201d to the wealthy and adding, \u201cwe didn\u2019t need to add a penny to our debt to have the tax cut for our working and middle-class people.\u201d A series of factors contributed to the surprise outcome in Pennsylvania, including Saccone\u2019s much-criticized campaign and listless fundraising. Still, it was an ominous test case, and it\u2019s not the only warning sign. Nationally, polls show Republicans continue to face a 9- to 10-point deficit on the generic ballot, despite passage of the tax plan in December. And recent polling on the tax plan suggests that public support is split at best and underwater at worst. A Quinnipiac poll released last week found that 36% of American voters supported it, compared to 50% who opposed it. That\u2019s an improvement from November, when Quinnipiac first started polling on the tax plan and found support at just 25%.  But support appears to be leveling off after a high-water mark of 39% in early February. A recent Monmouth University poll found opinion on the tax cuts split, with 41% of respondents approving and 42% disapproving. In Indiana, where vulnerable red-state Democrat Joe Donnelly is running for reelection to the US Senate, both Republicans and Democrats see the tax cuts as an attack line. Last week, Americans for Prosperity \u2013 one of the conservative Koch brothers political spending vehicles \u2013 announced a second wave of ads worth $4 million targeting Donnelly and and a fellow red-state Democrat, Sen. Claire McCaskill of Missouri, for their opposition to the tax cuts. In the ad, a small businesswoman says: \u201cBecause of the tax cuts, I\u2019m able to invest more money back into my business. When I heard that Joe Donnelly voted against the tax cuts, I was very disappointed. Senator Donnelly just doesn\u2019t realize the impact that these tax cuts have on the everyday person and the everyday business. Joe Donnelly let Hoosiers down.\u201d On the other side, the Senate Majority PAC, a leading Democratic super PAC, released an ad backed by $500,000 that defends Donnelly for opposing the plan. In the spot, a man loads his truck, drives to work at a manufacturing plant and says, \u201cThey say the new tax law was written to help families like mine, but so much of it goes to millionaires and big corporations. And it\u2019s adding trillions to our national debt. Now they\u2019re talking about cutting Medicare and Social Security to pay for it. Our Senator, Joe Donnelly, voted no. He supported a middle class tax cut. Out of state billionaires are attacking him for it. But I know Joe Donnelly is always looking out for Indiana.\u201d Chris Hayden, communications director for the group, told CNN, \u201cWhen you tell voters that this adds $1.8 trillion to the deficit, that [Republicans] want to attack Social Security and Medicare to pay for it, that health care premiums are going up even though health care companies got billions from the tax bill \u2013 opinions swing back in favor\u201d of Democrats. \u201cWe believe it\u2019s a winnable issue.\u201d And House Majority PAC, another leading Democratic super PAC focused on the lower chamber, also made a small TV ad buy last week attacking GOP Speaker Paul Ryan and highlighting \u201cthe Wall Street millionaires that Ryan gave billions in tax breaks.\u201d Republicans argue that the tax overhaul will take time to sell to a wary electorate after its rushed passage. And some party members are already hinting at a so-called \u201cphase two\u201d of tax legislation, though the details are still unclear. Kevin Brady, chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, told Fox News recently, \u201cWe think even more can be done,\u201d and President Donald Trump has expressed support for the idea, telling a business executive roundtable, \u201cIt\u2019s going to be something very special, Kevin Brady\u2019s working on it with me.\u201d Matt Gorman, communications director for the NRCC, told CNN that tax reform is the \u201chub of a wheel\u201d of economic policy wins, \u201cone of if not the biggest legislative accomplishment\u201d of the Republican Congress. He touted the cuts as part of a \u201cbroader agenda that speaks to people\u2019s pocketbooks,\u201d including efforts on vocational training, student loans, and childcare. Gorman also noted that \u201cone of the best ways to get tax cut numbers up is keep reading local press,\u201d and cited recent headlines about wage increases, bonuses and hiring as a result of the tax legislation. The polling is \u201con the right side up and rising,\u201d he said.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: James A. Barnes is a member of the CNN Decision Desk and co-author of the 2018 Almanac of American Politics. In the 2016 presidential election Donald Trump defeated Hillary Clinton in the 18th Congressional District in southwestern Pennsylvania by 58%-38%, and rolled up a margin over his Democratic rival of more than 72,000 votes. That showing was one of Trump\u2019s strongest in a state that he only won by some 44,000 votes. Republican Rep. Tim Murphy, who represented the 18th, was reelected without opposition that year, just as he was in 2014. But 16 months later, Democrat Conor Lamb has claimed victory and appears to have won a whisker-thin victory in special election to replace Murphy, who resigned after a personal scandal. CNN and other news organizations have not declared Lamb the winner, pending a complete tally of absentee, provisional and military ballots. Whatever the final outcome, the collapse of the Trump vote in a range of places, from well-heeled suburban enclaves around Pittsburgh, to working class townships, from exurbs to rural boroughs, should be a severe wake-up call for Republicans who must defend dozens of similar districts in the midterm elections just eight months from now. And for Democrats fighting over the future of their party, it\u2019s a message that they can field moderate candidates who can win in Trump country if they can turn out the vote. Obviously turnout in a special election is much lower, so these comparisons are not exact, but the numbers reflect a significance beyond turnout numbers. The suburban townships of southern Allegheny County that made up roughly 45% of the total ballots cast in this special election (up from 42% in the 2016 presidential race) provided Lamb with his critical margin of victory. Clinton only won about 48% of the votes in this portion of the 18th in 2016, but Lamb captured 57% on Tuesday, eclipsing Saccone by more than 15,000 votes. Mt. Lebanon is the kind of white collar suburban town where Democrats are expected to do well these days: more than two-thirds of the adults have at least a four-year college degree and the median household income is $86,422 according to the latest census data. Indeed, Clinton carried Mt. Lebanon with 65% of the vote in 2016 and Lamb won a whopping 73%, a sign that Democratic voters are highly energized right now. Bethel Park, less prosperous, but still well off, where less than half the adults are college grads, flipped from Trump, who won the township with 55% of the vote in 2016, to Lamb, who won 55% on Tuesday. Moon Township, where President Trump held a weekend pre-election rally for Saccone, also went for Lamb by seven percentage points. Trump carried it by 11 points. And one of the wealthiest towns in this part of Allegheny, Upper St. Clair, where the median household income clocks in at  $110,417, which narrowly went for Trump over Clinton by about three percentage points, swung to Lamb who won it by 11 points. Working class townships in Allegheny like Elizabeth and Whitehall also swung to the Democrats. Saccone, who represents Elizabeth in the state legislature, won the township by 19 percentage points on Tuesday. In 2016, Trump won it by 29 points. Whitehall, which was a draw between Trump and Clinton, went for Lamb by almost 21 percentage points. Saccone won Washington County by some 3,400 votes, but that was a far short of the nearly 22,000-vote advantage that Trump harvested over Clinton. In Peters Township, a well-off, well-educated Pittsburgh exurb, Saccone defeated Lamb by a comfortable 59%-41%. But Trump bested Clinton, 67%-34%. Moreover, Saccone\u2019s margin over Lamb was roughly 1,500 votes while Trump swamped Clinton by more than 4,200. Saccone eked out a 150-vote win over Lamb in North Strabane, an adjacent Pittsburgh exurb, but Trump bested Clinton more than 1,800 votes in 2016. In more downscale townships like Cecil and Chartiers, the Republican vote also eroded. Trump carried Cecil by almost 2,000 votes, besting Clinton by 29 percentage points. Saccone won Cecil by just over 200 votes, defeating Lamb by about five percentage points. And in blue-collar Chartiers, where Trump thumped Clinton by about 25 percentage points, Lamb edged out Saccone, 51%-49%. Republican margins also tumbled in Westmoreland County portions of the 18th, the GOP stronghold in district. In 2016, Trump defeated Clinton by more than two-to-one here and amassed almost a 40,000-vote margin. In this special election, Saccone defeated Lamb 57%-42%, by a little more than 10,000 votes. (Westmoreland County had not reported precinct and township votes by the time this article was published.) Even in the most rural part of the 18th Congressional District in Greene County, Democrat Lamb made inroads on Republican turf. Trump won this portion of 18th in 2016 by an overwhelming 72%-28% and more than 3,500 votes. Saccone only beat Lamb here by about 58%-41%, less than 800 votes, with handful of absentee ballots to be counted. In Franklin Township, where only 14% of the adults have a four-year college degree, Saccone won by roughly 15 percentage points and about 200 votes. In 2016, Trump defeated Clinton by 43 percentage points and about 1,000 votes. In tiny town of Perry, Saccone bested Lamb, 55%-44%, where Trump had crushed Clinton, 71%-29%. And in Waynesburg Borough, Lamb edged out Saccone 53%-47%, where Trump coasted by Clinton, 63%-37%. Based on the results of this special congressional election, Republicans need to brace themselves for a Democratic wave that could swamp similar GOP congressional seats. Looking at the demographic and political characteristics of Pennsylvania 18, one can quickly identify GOP-held districts in danger like: And in those 12 districts, Clinton won no more than 45% of the vote in 2016. There are 119 Republican House members who should be VERY nervous today There are 23 additional GOP-held districts not on that list that Clinton won in \u201916.  And there probably are another dozen or so Rustbelt districts similar to Pennsylvania 18 that could develop into competitive contests. Shortly before the election, Saccone complained that reporters had given Lamb favorable coverage while, \u201cI have a big r\u00e9sum\u00e9 that they try and scrunch down and don\u2019t say anything about.\u201d Yet last Saturday, at a Pittsburgh airport rally for the GOP standard bearer, President Trump barely mentioned Saccone\u2019s name, let alone the record or policy stands of the four-term state legislator. Instead, Trump repeatedly asked an enthusiastic crowd to vote for Saccone because he was likely to support the President\u2019s agenda in Congress. This pitch by Trump was consistent with the Republican strategy to nationalize the Pennsylvania special congressional election. The message was pretty simple: Saccone will back Trump, Lamb will be an ally of House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi who has been a useful GOP political foil in previous election cycles. Republican PACS spent heavily on campaign ads linking Lamb to Pelosi. In a district that went for Trump by 20 percentage points over Hillary Clinton in 2016, this seemed like a logical approach to the race. Indeed, when Saccone was selected by a state GOP convention last November to be the party\u2019s nominee for the special election, he embraced this appeal, declaring, \u201cI was Trump before Trump was Trump.\u201d But this strategy relied on mobilizing the Trump base and relegated Saccone to almost a footnote in his own race. Perhaps in a stand-alone special election it\u2019s inevitable that Trump is going to be the overwhelming focus of the race. But the outcome in Pennsylvania suggests that Republicans who think they can mobilize the Trump base and ride out an impending Democratic wave next November could be making a bad political bet. At the same time, Democrats were blessed in the 18th Congressional District by having Lamb as their nominee. There\u2019s no doubt that he was a superior candidate, well suited for his district, compared to the Democratic nominees of the four previous House special elections that the party lost. Making similar shrewd recruiting decisions will also be key to Democratic prospects come November.",

            "article_content": "House Republicans got a stern warning Wednesday morning to take the results of a Pennsylvania congressional race as \u201ca wake-up call\u201d ahead of November\u2019s midterm elections. House Speaker Paul Ryan and top campaign lieutenants said at a closed-door GOP meeting that the down-to-the-wire outcome in what had been a reliably red district shows that Democratic enthusiasm is real and all incumbents need to be prepared for competitive races. \u201cThis is a wake-up call,\u201d Rep. Steve Stivers of Ohio, the chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee, told GOP lawmakers gathered for the private caucus meeting. \u201cIf you\u2019re getting outraised, this is a wake-up call. Prepare to bear down.\u201d Holding onto a narrow lead, Democrat Conor Lamb declared victory in the wee Wednesday morning hours as his special election match-up against Republican Rick Saccone in Pennsylvania\u2019s 18th District went down to the wire and the final absentee and provisional ballots were being counted. For Republicans, that the race was close at all is alarming: President Donald Trump won the district by 20 percentage points in 2016, and the GOP had pulled out all the stops to prevent an embarrassing loss, including dispatching Trump to campaign there twice and spending heavily on the race. Stivers told Republicans that \u201cour voters turned out, but you can\u2019t get outspent five to one.\u201d It was a jab at Saccone\u2019s paltry fundraising: He took in just $615,000, while Lamb raised $3 million. But outside Republican groups pumped another $10.7 million into the race \u2013 including about $3.5 million each from the National Republican Congressional Committee and the Congressional Leadership Fund, a super PAC aligned with Ryan. And the GOP still fell short in what had for years been seen as a safe district. Ryan on Wednesday morning was re-emphasizing a message he\u2019s delivered GOP lawmakers for months: The tax bill, passed in December, needs to be sold aggressively \u2013 particularly as a boost for working-class families. Republicans in competitive races acknowledge Wednesday that Pennsylvania served as a warning. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s need to be alarmed, but there\u2019s certainly reason to be concerned,\u201d said North Dakota Rep. Kevin Cramer, who is challenging Democratic Sen. Heidi Heitkamp. Oklahoma Rep. Tom Cole said the message from the special election was clear. \u201cYou better be ready and in the end you determine your own fate in these things, particularly when you\u2019re running with candidates who have run before and won in difficult circumstances,\u201d Cole said, noting that the most vulnerable members are the 23 Republicans in seats that Hillary Clinton carried in 2016. Republicans also argued that Trump\u2019s visit the Saturday before the election helped Saccone make up some ground in the final days of the race. \u201cit was probably a little bit too little, too late,\u201d Illinois GOP Rep. John Shimkus told reporters. He said he thinks the President can help in some districts, but lawmakers will have to make that determination on their own. \u201cI think in Pennsylvania the feedback was that Trump actually closed the gap for Saccone by coming in, so there was a feeling that there was going to be a bigger deficit for Saccone than there may have been, but it\u2019s probably different district by district,\u201d said Ohio Rep. Warren Davidson. Several Republicans indicated that Ryan and other leaders gave a clear message that members can\u2019t be outraised by challengers and they need to work harder to have a financial advantage in a challenging political climate. \u201cMoney is something you can make up pretty quickly, particularly if you are an incumbent and it\u2019s a competitive seat,\u201d Cole said. But GOP lawmakers criticized their own candidate, Saccone, for not raising enough money and failing to take control of the narrative in the race. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to control your own destiny and he didn\u2019t,\u201d Shimkus said. Shimkus pointed to the financial gap in the two campaigns as the reason why Saccone couldn\u2019t use the tax bill as an effective issue because he let outside groups and Lamb define who he was. \u201cHe couldn\u2019t do the positive message because he didn\u2019t have the money,\u201d Shimkus said. Lamb said on the campaign trail that he\u2019d oppose House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, a California Democrat, for speaker. But that didn\u2019t seem to diminish Pelosi\u2019s happiness over the outcome in a district where Democrats have been blown out in recent elections. \u201cIt\u2019s exciting. It\u2019s very exciting,\u201d Pelosi said as she walked into a Democratic caucus meeting Wednesday morning. \u201cThis goes to show you this election is about the people of western Pennsylvania. But it\u2019s very exciting.\u201d Pelosi added that the results showed \u201cthe enthusiasm for our candidates.\u201d Louisiana Republican Sen. John Kennedy, always one for colorful language, put it this way. \u201cWe got our ass kicked,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cIt\u2019s what the political prognosticators called a good ol\u2019 fashioned ass-kicking.\u201d CNN\u2019s Manu Raju contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Joe Biden, campaigning for Democrat Conor Lamb ahead of the House special election here next week, laid out a path for his party to win back the working-class voters who rejected them in 2016. In doing so Tuesday, the former Vice President offered a glimpse of how he\u2019d approach 2020 if he runs for president again: by working to rebuild a Democratic coalition that includes white, rural, blue-collar voters. That approach starts in districts like Pennsylvania\u2019s 18th, where there is currently a closely watched contest taking place between Lamb and Republican state Rep. Rick Saccone, who is backed by President Donald Trump. The district votes heavily Republican; Trump beat Hillary Clinton here by 20 points in 2016. But there are actually more voters registered as a Democrats. \u201cThe suburbs, the exurbs, the smaller towns \u2013 they got hit pretty hard,\u201d Biden said Tuesday at Robert Morris University, where he led a get-out-the-vote rally. What you need to know right now about the 2018 midterm elections He said Republicans \u201ctalk about caring about\u201d and offering solutions for those regions, \u201cbut they\u2019re not doing any of it.\u201d \u201cThis is all within our wheelhouse,\u201d Biden said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to remember who the hell we are.\u201d At a union carpenters\u2019 apprenticeship shop, Biden tied his earliest days in politics to local union support. \u201cYou\u2019ve always had my back,\u201d he said. He cast Lamb, the 33-year-old Marine veteran and prosecutor, as cut from the same cloth. \u201cHe reminds me of my son Beau,\u201d the former Delaware attorney general and rising Democratic star who died of brain cancer in 2015, Biden said. Twice, Lamb introduced Biden as \u201ca leader that everybody likes.\u201d There\u2019s truth to the phrase: Biden has stepped in as Democrats\u2019 most valuable surrogate in Republican-leaning and working-class regions. He drew a massive crowd last fall in Birmingham, Alabama,\u00a0to kick off Doug Jones\u2019 push to\u00a0the\u00a0Senate\u00a0special election.\u00a0He\u2019s\u00a0sought-after by Democrats in red states, with fundraising events coming up this month in Montana and North Dakota, where Democratic senators face tough re-election battles. Biden positioning himself as a cross-party healer is far from a unanimous position within a party that is hungry for anti-Trump brawlers and with a field of potential candidates 2020 that includes a progressive set of ambitious lawmakers. There\u2019s evidence to support Biden\u2019s assertion that Lamb can win. Recent polls have shown a tight race, including one from Monmouth University in mid-February that had Saccone leading by just 3 percentage points. Republicans have raced to save the deep-red district vacated when former Rep. Tim Murphy stepped down, in part because of what Biden predicted to reporters on a ropeline after his event at the union apprenticeship shop: A loss here would throw the GOP into panic and could trigger a wave of retirements. The National Republican Congressional Committee on Tuesday invested another $619,000 in TV ads, upping the party committee\u2019s spending to $3.5 million in the race and total GOP outside group spending to about $10 million. That\u2019s a massive price tag for a race Democratic groups are largely ignoring. Trump\u2019s announcement of tariffs on imports of steel and aluminum was also seen by some as a move designed to bolster Saccone\u2019s chances. Trump has already visited the district once during the special election and plans another trip Saturday. The steel tariffs were backed by both candidates in a Saturday debate. \u201cFor too long China has been making cheap steel, and they\u2019ve been flooding the market with it. It\u2019s not fair, and it\u2019s not right. So I think it\u2019s long overdue,\u201d Lamb said then. Saccone used the opening to heap praise on Trump. \u201cIt\u2019s the first volley in what he\u2019s doing. He\u2019s a negotiator. He\u2019s a master negotiator. You put out the line and maybe there\u2019ll be a little bit of give and take on it, but at the end, you come out with a good deal for America,\u201d he said. But Lamb has been able to parry other GOP attacks. Republican groups had long sought to use the party\u2019s tax bill against Lamb and had also spent millions tying him to House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi, even though Lamb has said he does not support Pelosi and would not vote for her for speaker. In recent days, Republicans have shifted their emphasis away from those attacks, an indicator they weren\u2019t having the desired impact, and toward attacks on his time as a federal prosecutor. Biden, meanwhile, swung back on the tax bill, saying it would lead to cuts in Medicare and Social Security. Of House Speaker Paul Ryan, Biden said, \u201cIf you met him, you\u2019d think he\u2019s a decent (guy) \u2013 he\u2019s just read too much Ayn Rand.\u201d \u201cTake a look what\u2019s happening,\u201d Biden said of the GOP in the Trump era. \u201cPeople are realizing the bill of goods they\u2019ve been sold.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Donald Trump\u2019s ascent to the presidency brought with it a host of new household names. Corey Lewandowski, Hope Hicks, Kellyanne Conway, Steve Bannon \u2013 to name just a few. But not Brad Parscale, who flew under the radar throughout most of 2016 as the Trump campaign\u2019s digital advertising and data guru. That relative anonymity began to unfurl on Tuesday with the announcement that Parscale will helm Trump\u2019s 2020 re-election bid as campaign manager, but his appointment was little surprise to Trump campaign veterans and insiders. Even Parscale\u2019s title in 2016 as the campaign\u2019s digital director undersold his influence within the organization and his impact on Trump\u2019s stunning electoral victory. Trump taps Brad Parscale to run his 2020 re-election campaign Officially hired in June 2016, Parscale helmed the Trump campaign\u2019s data analytics team. That operation came to dictate nearly every move the campaign made in the final months to Election Day, from Trump\u2019s travel schedule to the campaign\u2019s allocation of human and financial resources in key battleground states. \u201cBrad had a pretty complex understanding of how to look at numbers and data in real time and then be able to allocate resources based on what he was seeing real time,\u201d a former senior Trump campaign official said. In the final weeks, that meant moving resources into states like Michigan and Wisconsin that were expected to go blue in 2016 but ended up proving crucial to Trump\u2019s upset victory. \u201cI was, like, \u2018we can go in and get this,\u2019 and I changed all the budgets around,\u201d Parscale told CBS\u2019s \u201c60 Minutes\u201d last year. \u201cI took every nickel and dime I could out of anywhere else. And I moved it to Michigan and Wisconsin. And I started buying advertising, digital, TV.\u201d Beyond Trump\u2019s travel to those states that left pundits scratching their heads in the weeks before the election, most of those moves \u2013 and the rationale behind them \u2013 remained out of the public eye. Parscale did not immediately return a CNN request for comment. The digital director worked directly under Jared Kushner, who was the final arbiter on many key campaign decisions despite not holding a formal title in his father-in-law\u2019s campaign. Some within the campaign maintained that Kushner was the true campaign manager and Parscale his deputy. While Kushner\u2019s status inside the White House, where he serves as a senior adviser, has come under question amid uncertainty over his security clearance, the President\u2019s pick of Parscale to helm the campaign makes clear Kushner remains a hugely influential voice. \u201cBrad was essential in bringing a disciplined technology and data-driven approach to how the 2016 campaign was run,\u201d Kushner said in a statement provided by the Trump campaign. \u201cHis leadership and expertise will be (sic) help build a best-in-class campaign.\u201d Parscale\u2019s role at the helm of the Trump campaign\u2019s data analytics operation has also drawn the scrutiny of those investigating Russian interference in the 2016 campaign and allegations of collusion. The Trump campaign\u2019s data analytics operation is being looked at by special counsel Robert Mueller, CNN reported in May 2017. Parscale has repeatedly denied any knowledge of the Russian operation to influence the 2016 campaign in favor of Trump and against Hillary Clinton, and says he told the House Intelligence Committee last year as much when he appeared for an interview behind closed doors. Parscale has also denied any knowledge of Cambridge Analytica CEO Alexander Nix\u2019s attempts to reach WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange during the 2016 campaign, while the firm was contracted by the Trump campaign and working closely with Parscale. Parscale has remained an active force in Trumpworld since the campaign ended, taking on a key role with America First policies, a pro-Trump political organization. Parscale\u2019s Florida-based firm, Parscale Strategy, has a contract with the Republican National Committee to, among other things, help grow its data base of small donors. Parscale had never worked in politics before joining the Trump campaign in 2015. He knew the candidate and his family from working for the Trump Organization for several years designing websites and helping develop digital strategy for Trump businesses. While Parscale developed a strong relationship with Trump, the data guru\u2019s intense spending on digital media did not always sit well with the candidate. During the campaign, Trump angrily questioned Parscale about how he was spending campaign cash. \u201cI don\u2019t believe in this mumbo-jumbo digital stuff,\u201d Parscale recalled Trump screaming at him during the campaign. \u201cTrump\u2019s just laying into me. I was crushed actually. It was the first time he had ever, just\u2013 I hadn\u2019t even seen him yell at anyone, let alone me,\u201d Parscale said in the \u201c60 Minutes\u201d interview. That changed after Trump\u2019s upset victory \u2013 one few in the President\u2019s orbit saw coming \u2013 and Parscale said Trump \u201cthanked me after the election, told me I did a great job.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Democrats running across the country find themselves at odds with each other just a week ahead of the first primary elections, as divisions between the progressive and establishment wings spill out into the open and attempts to winnow down one of the largest fields of candidates in recent memory creates a headache for the national party. In Texas, where the first primaries take place on March 6, it\u2019s gotten nasty and personal, with progressive anger directed at the party\u2019s campaign arm, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, for intervening in the Houston-area primary race by posting negative research on a candidate. The attack sent signals to Democrats running everywhere: The DCCC is willing to step into primaries and even attack Democratic candidates to make sure what it sees as viable contenders advance to November\u2019s midterm elections. CNN key House races: New Pennsylvania maps help Democrats in several districts In California, Democrats are encountering an embarrassment of riches: With so many candidates running, activists and party leaders are fretting that a top-two-advance primary system could shut Democrats out of the general election because their primary votes are split. It\u2019s led to a mad last-minute scramble to winnow the primary field before a March 9 filing deadline. And in other races throughout the country, where the dynamics of the intra-party squabbles vary, national and local Democrats have sharpened their elbows. \u201cWe\u2019ve gone through the diplomatic stage and are fast approaching the military intervention,\u201d one party official said, employing a war analogy. Less than two weeks before voters in Texas head to the polls, the DCCC threw a haymaker in the race to unseat Republican Rep. John Culberson by posting negative research on progressive Democratic hopeful Laura Moser, labeling her a \u201cWashington insider\u201d and highlighting a comment in which she said she wouldn\u2019t want to live in Paris, Texas. The attacked led progressives to cry foul at the national party, which grassroots activists had accused of favoritism for Hillary Clinton over Bernie Sanders in the 2016 presidential race. \u201cHouston is pretty indicative of a broader trend that\u2019s been happening cycle after cycle where they have an outdated playbook of what a winnable district is and what an electable candidate is,\u201d said Annie Weinberg, the executive director of Democracy For America, one of the DCCC\u2019s loudest critics within progressive ranks. Meredith Kelly, the DCCC\u2019s communications director, said the organization \u201cis keeping all options on the table\u201d to make sure there\u2019s a \u201ccompetitive Democrat\u201d on the ballot November. \u201cVoters across the country have been working hard for over a year to hold House Republicans accountable and flip key districts blue, and the DCCC has long recognized and appreciated the unprecedented influence that the grassroots have in these races,\u201d Kelly said. After its step into the Texas race, the DCCC faces intense scrutiny. Its Red-to-Blue program, which highlights 24 Democratic candidates in targeted, Republican-held congressional districts, operates as a de facto endorsement \u2013 leading to complaints from other candidates in those races. Pam Keith, a candidate in the Florida 18th District race, where the DCCC included primary foe Lauren Baer in its Red-to-Blue program, said being excluded from the program has made her candidacy a tougher sell with donors \u2013 in part by creating the impression that the party wouldn\u2019t back her if she emerged from the primary. \u201cIn a time where the energy of the voters is not necessarily stacking up behind the biggest self-funders, the most wealthy-candidates, to say, \u2018We hear you, we hear you, we hear you, we just don\u2019t care, we\u2019re going to tell you who the candidate\u2019s going to be,\u2019 is inappropriate,\u201d Keith said. Keith, an African-American candidate who was highlighted by The Collective PAC, which complained recently that African-American candidates hadn\u2019t been included in the Red-to-Blue program, added, \u201cThe DCCC has deputized itself to be the ultimate arbiter of who is and who is not viable, who can and who cannot win.\u201d Some Democrats involved in 2018 races defend the role the DCCC plays in recruiting and identifying top prospects, even if it means shoving others aside. \u201cThey have an impossible job this cycle. It\u2019s impossible,\u201d said Jon Soltz, the chairman of VoteVets, which backs Democratic military veterans\u2019 campaigns. \u201cThere\u2019s so many great people running across the board that it\u2019s impossible to make everybody happy.\u201d He said with such a vast crop of candidates, the party plays an important role in identifying strong candidates to help donors and outside groups identify where to spend their money. \u201cDonors are overrun from candidates calling them and they don\u2019t know which ones to support and which ones not to,\u201d Soltz said. In California, Democrats have taken a much different tone on heavy-handed involvement in primaries: Local activists eagerly welcome it. Because of the party\u2019s primary system, in a race with many more Democratic candidates than Republicans, the top two vote-getters could be Republicans, even if Democratic candidates collectively receive much more support. Looming large is the March 9 filing deadline. After that, candidates can withdraw from the race, but they\u2019d still appear on ballots. The two races worrying national, state and local party leaders are the 39th District, where Rep. Ed Royce is retiring, and the 49th District, where Rep. Darrell Issa won\u2019t seek re-election. \u201cWe all are quite worried. It\u2019s not just the political chattering class,\u201d said Terra Lawson-Remer, the head of Flip the 49th, a local grassroots organization. The DCCC has stepped in, conducting polls in both districts in January and then sharing the results with every candidate. It also held meetings with California\u2019s congressional delegation and leaned on those lawmakers to help prevent the primary fields from growing larger still. The party\u2019s moves, an official said, could also include spending to boost certain Democratic candidates, as it did to boost Salud Carbajal through a top-two primary in 2016. Or, Democrats could also repeat a Moser-style attack. In an effort to winnow the field, Flip the 49th invited all five candidates to a forum on Friday night, where they\u2019ll be asked to speak directly to their paths to victory \u2013 and if none exists, they\u2019ll be prodded to drop out. \u201cWhat leadership looks like is stepping aside for the collective good and the good of the country instead of putting your own ego first,\u201d Lawson-Remer said. \u201cThis is way more urgent than people realize.\u201d",

            "article_content": "The Dow Jones Industrial Average has yo-yoed from a historic loss on Monday to a 500-plus point gain on Tuesday. Why? And what does the future hold for the Dow \u2013 and for President Donald Trump, who has repeatedly cited the soaring stock market as evidence that his policies are working? I reached out to CNN Money\u2019s Matt Egan for some answers. We exchanged a series of emails on Tuesday about What It All Means. Our conversation, lightly edited for flow, is below. Cillizza: The Dow tanked on Monday. Largest loss  \u2013 in terms of points \u2013 in history. So, um, why? (I took one macroeconomics class in college, so go easy on me.) Also, the White House response was, essentially: Be cool. Everything is totally chill. Are they right? Are the fundamentals of the economy strong despite what happened Monday? Egan: Don\u2019t sweat it. We\u2019ll keep it simple. Yes, the Dow dropped a record 1,175 points Monday. But pay close attention to the percentage decline. It was 4.6%. That\u2019s pretty ugly (worst since 2011), but not as bad as the 7% losses experienced several times in 2008. The big difference between now and 2008 is that the economy IS healthy right now. The fundamentals \u2013 unemployment, GDP growth, corporate earnings \u2013 do look strong. If anything, the sudden concern on Wall Street is that the economy may be overheating. That means inflation, which stock investors hate. Inflation is no fun for the stock market because it forces the Federal Reserve to aggressively [raise] interest rates. Think of that like removing the punch bowl from the party. Cillizza: Spiked punch? OK. Good to remember too that the stock market is not the economy and vice versa. They are correlated but not the same thing. What I wonder is if \u2013 despite the underlying strengths of the economy \u2013 a handful of bad days for the stock market starts to become a self-fulfilling prophecy.  Like, the market drops 3,000 points in a week and everyone freaks the hell out despite knowing that this isn\u2019t 2008 all over again. Does that freak out wind up tanking the recovery? Egan: You\u2019re right about the stock market not being the economy. The US unemployment rate is at a 17-year low of 4.1%. That hasn\u2019t changed overnight just because the Dow plunged. But there\u2019s no doubt that if the market continued having scary days it would have an impact on the real economy. Americans still look at the Dow to get a pulse on the mood of financial markets. If they saw the Dow losing 1,000 points on the regular, it would dent consumer sentiment and perhaps spending. CEO and small business confidence would also take a hit, leading to less hiring. Thankfully, we\u2019re not at that point yet. By a long shot. The Dow spiked an incredible 8,283 points between the election and the peak of two weeks ago. Roughly a quarter of that gain has been wiped out. Cillizza: That\u2019s a very interesting point \u2013 what people believe the Dow represents. The average person \u2013 I don\u2019t think \u2013 really understands what the Dow actually is but they do put some stock\u2013 ahem \u2013 in it. Consumer confidence is at least partially based in the Dow, even though most people have no idea what it is measuring! Now, for a little politics. Trump has spent the last year claiming credit for all the gains from the stock market. And insisting that without him in office, the stock market would have dropped 50%. How much influence can any one person \u2013 the President included \u2013 have on the Dow? And how? Egan: President Trump has gone out of his way to claim credit for the booming stock market. He\u2019s tweeted about the market dozens of times since getting elected. And unlike his predecessors, he\u2019s often commenting on the day-to-day moves \u2013 not just the broad gains. It\u2019s fair to say that a sizable chunk of the post-election rally was driven by enthusiasm over the Trump economic agenda. Specifically, investors were fired up about the plan to cut regulation, give businesses massive tax cuts and let them repatriate foreign profits. But that\u2019s only part of the story. The other part is that Corporate America has been minting money \u2013 even before the tax cuts. Those earnings power stock prices. Moreover, the economic backdrop has been strong. US growth picked up in 2017 and the global economy is finally firing on all cylinders. And don\u2019t forget that Trump inherited a solid economy and a bull market in stocks that had already been alive for nearly eight years. Cillizza: But, there\u2019s talk now that the tax cuts are actually behind all of this, right? That rising wages is pushing up inflation worries? You mentioned it briefly before. How much of that is hard facts and how much is guesswork given that tax cut implementation is in its earliest stages? As for Trump, I have long believed he\u2019s a day-to-day President. As in, what he does today tells us very little about what he will do tomorrow. And, unlike most other politicians, he is totally unbothered by saying the sky is green on a Tuesday and that it\u2019s actually blue on Wednesday. So, he is totally unconcerned that by touting the market\u2019s gains for much of the first year of his presidency, he might be held to account if and when the Dow goes into an extended slump. It\u2019s actually somewhat remarkable. He\u2019s like the Drew Barrymore character in \u201c50 First Dates.\u201d (Adam Sandler\u2019s finest hour.) He wakes up every morning totally unaware of what he has said and done the day before. It must be a freeing way to look at the world. Egan: The past few days have showed how hitching your presidency to the notoriously fickle stock market can make things a bit uncomfortable. Markets are moody and a rally can quickly turn into a selloff. So here\u2019s the way to think about the tax cuts and the stock market. Wall Street got really excited about the idea of companies saving tons on what they owe Uncle Sam. The market didn\u2019t really question whether the economy, which already looked healthy, actually needed a big dose of medicine. But some economists had been warning that stimulating a strong economy can have negative side effects. Like inflation that forces the Fed to raise rates so quickly that stocks slide. That fear has been at the heart of the recent turmoil. Consider how the market reacted to the really good jobs news on Friday. Best wage growth since 2009. Yet stocks tumbled. Investors are worried about those pay raises eating into corporate profits. And forcing the Fed to act. It\u2019s an example of good news for Main Street being bad news for Wall Street.",

            "article_content": "President Donald Trump gave his first State of the Union address on Tuesday. Read the President\u2019s speech as prepared for delivery and released by the White House: Mr. Speaker, Mr. Vice President, Members of Congress, the First Lady of the United States, and my fellow Americans: Less than 1 year has passed since I first stood at this podium, in this majestic chamber, to speak on behalf of the American People \u2013 and to address their concerns, their hopes, and their dreams.  That night, our new Administration had already taken swift action.  A new tide of optimism was already sweeping across our land. Each day since, we have gone forward with a clear vision and a righteous mission \u2013 to make America great again for all Americans. Over the last year, we have made incredible progress and achieved extraordinary success.  We have faced challenges we expected, and others we could never have imagined.  We have shared in the heights of victory and the pains of hardship.  We endured floods and fires and storms.  But through it all, we have seen the beauty of America\u2019s soul, and the steel in America\u2019s spine. Each test has forged new American heroes to remind us who we are, and show us what we can be. We saw the volunteers of the \u201cCajun Navy,\u201d racing to the rescue with their fishing boats to save people in the aftermath of a devastating hurricane. We saw strangers shielding strangers from a hail of gunfire on the Las Vegas strip. We heard tales of Americans like Coast Guard Petty Officer Ashlee Leppert, who is here tonight in the gallery with Melania.  Ashlee was aboard one of the first helicopters on the scene in Houston during Hurricane Harvey.  Through 18 hours of wind and rain, Ashlee braved live power lines and deep water, to help save more than 40 lives.  Thank you, Ashlee. We heard about Americans like firefighter David Dahlberg.  He is here with us too.  David faced down walls of flame to rescue almost 60 children trapped at a California summer camp threatened by wildfires. To everyone still recovering in Texas, Florida, Louisiana, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, California, and everywhere else \u2013 we are with you, we love you, and we will pull through together. Some trials over the past year touched this chamber very personally.  With us tonight is one of the toughest people ever to serve in this House \u2013 a guy who took a bullet, almost died, and was back to work three and a half months later:  the legend from Louisiana, Congressman Steve Scalise. We are incredibly grateful for the heroic efforts of the Capitol Police Officers, the Alexandria Police, and the doctors, nurses, and paramedics who saved his life, and the lives of many others in this room. In the aftermath of that terrible shooting, we came together, not as Republicans or Democrats, but as representatives of the people.  But it is not enough to come together only in times of tragedy.  Tonight, I call upon all of us to set aside our differences, to seek out common ground, and to summon the unity we need to deliver for the people we were elected to serve. Over the last year, the world has seen what we always knew:  that no people on Earth are so fearless, or daring, or determined as Americans.  If there is a mountain, we climb it.  If there is a frontier, we cross it.  If there is a challenge, we tame it.  If there is an opportunity, we seize it. So let us begin tonight by recognizing that the state of our Union is strong because our people are strong. And together, we are building a safe, strong, and proud America. Since the election, we have created 2.4 million new jobs, including 200,000 new jobs in manufacturing alone.  After years of wage stagnation, we are finally seeing rising wages. Unemployment claims have hit a 45-year low.  African-American unemployment stands at the lowest rate ever recorded, and Hispanic American unemployment has also reached the lowest levels in history. Small business confidence is at an all-time high.  The stock market has smashed one record after another, gaining $8 trillion in value.  That is great news for Americans\u2019 401k, retirement, pension, and college savings accounts. And just as I promised the American people from this podium 11 months ago, we enacted the biggest tax cuts and reforms in American history. Our massive tax cuts provide tremendous relief for the middle class and small businesses. To lower tax rates for hardworking Americans, we nearly doubled the standard deduction for everyone.  Now, the first $24,000 earned by a married couple is completely tax-free.  We also doubled the child tax credit. A typical family of four making $75,000 will see their tax bill reduced by $2,000 \u2013 slashing their tax bill in half. This April will be the last time you ever file under the old broken system \u2013 and millions of Americans will have more take-home pay starting next month. We eliminated an especially cruel tax that fell mostly on Americans making less than $50,000 a year \u2013 forcing them to pay tremendous penalties simply because they could not afford government-ordered health plans.  We repealed the core of disastrous Obamacare \u2013 the individual mandate is now gone. We slashed the business tax rate from 35 percent all the way down to 21 percent, so American companies can compete and win against anyone in the world.  These changes alone are estimated to increase average family income by more than $4,000. Small businesses have also received a massive tax cut, and can now deduct 20 percent of their business income. Here tonight are Steve Staub and Sandy Keplinger of Staub Manufacturing \u2013 a small business in Ohio.  They have just finished the best year in their 20-year history.  Because of tax reform, they are handing out raises, hiring an additional 14 people, and expanding into the building next door. One of Staub\u2019s employees, Corey Adams, is also with us tonight.  Corey is an all-American worker.  He supported himself through high school, lost his job during the 2008 recession, and was later hired by Staub, where he trained to become a welder.  Like many hardworking Americans, Corey plans to invest his tax\u2011cut raise into his new home and his two daughters\u2019 education.  Please join me in congratulating Corey. Since we passed tax cuts, roughly 3 million workers have already gotten tax cut bonuses \u2013 many of them thousands of dollars per worker.  Apple has just announced it plans to invest a total of $350 billion in America, and hire another 20,000 workers. This is our new American moment.  There has never been a better time to start living the American Dream. So to every citizen watching at home tonight \u2013 no matter where you have been, or where you come from, this is your time.  If you work hard, if you believe in yourself, if you believe in America, then you can dream anything, you can be anything, and together, we can achieve anything. Tonight, I want to talk about what kind of future we are going to have, and what kind of Nation we are going to be.  All of us, together, as one team, one people, and one American family. We all share the same home, the same heart, the same destiny, and the same great American flag. Together, we are rediscovering the American way. In America, we know that faith and family, not government and bureaucracy, are the center of the American life.  Our motto is \u201cin God we trust.\u201d And we celebrate our police, our military, and our amazing veterans as heroes who deserve our total and unwavering support. Here tonight is Preston Sharp, a 12-year-old boy from Redding, California, who noticed that veterans\u2019 graves were not marked with flags on Veterans Day.  He decided to change that, and started a movement that has now placed 40,000 flags at the graves of our great heroes.  Preston:  a job well done. Young patriots like Preston teach all of us about our civic duty as Americans.  Preston\u2019s reverence for those who have served our Nation reminds us why we salute our flag, why we put our hands on our hearts for the pledge of allegiance, and why we proudly stand for the national anthem. Americans love their country.  And they deserve a Government that shows them the same love and loyalty in return. For the last year we have sought to restore the bonds of trust between our citizens and their Government. Working with the Senate, we are appointing judges who will interpret the Constitution as written, including a great new Supreme Court Justice, and more circuit court judges than any new administration in the history of our country. We are defending our Second Amendment, and have taken historic actions to protect religious liberty. And we are serving our brave veterans, including giving our veterans choice in their healthcare decisions.  Last year, the Congress passed, and I signed, the landmark VA Accountability Act.  Since its passage, my Administration has already removed more than 1,500 VA employees who failed to give our veterans the care they deserve \u2013 and we are hiring talented people who love our vets as much as we do. I will not stop until our veterans are properly taken care of, which has been my promise to them from the very beginning of this great journey. All Americans deserve accountability and respect \u2013 and that is what we are giving them.  So tonight, I call on the Congress to empower every Cabinet Secretary with the authority to reward good workers \u2013 and to remove Federal employees who undermine the public trust or fail the American people. In our drive to make Washington accountable, we have eliminated more regulations in our first year than any administration in history. We have ended the war on American Energy \u2013 and we have ended the war on clean coal.  We are now an exporter of energy to the world. In Detroit, I halted Government mandates that crippled America\u2019s autoworkers \u2013 so we can get the Motor City revving its engines once again. Many car companies are now building and expanding plants in the United States \u2013 something we have not seen for decades.    Chrysler is moving a major plant from Mexico to Michigan; Toyota and Mazda are opening up a plant in Alabama.  Soon, plants will be opening up all over the country.  This is all news Americans are unaccustomed to hearing \u2013 for many years, companies and jobs were only leaving us.  But now they are coming back. Exciting progress is happening every day. To speed access to breakthrough cures and affordable generic drugs, last year the FDA approved more new and generic drugs and medical devices than ever before in our history. We also believe that patients with terminal conditions should have access to experimental treatments that could potentially save their lives. People who are terminally ill should not have to go from country to country to seek a cure \u2013 I want to give them a chance right here at home.  It is time for the Congress to give these wonderful Americans the \u201cright to try.\u201d One of my greatest priorities is to reduce the price of prescription drugs.  In many other countries, these drugs cost far less than what we pay in the United States.  That is why I have directed my Administration to make fixing the injustice of high drug prices one of our top priorities.  Prices will come down. America has also finally turned the page on decades of unfair trade deals that sacrificed our prosperity and shipped away our companies, our jobs, and our Nation\u2019s wealth. The era of economic surrender is over. From now on, we expect trading relationships to be fair and to be reciprocal. We will work to fix bad trade deals and negotiate new ones. And we will protect American workers and American intellectual property, through strong enforcement of our trade rules. As we rebuild our industries, it is also time to rebuild our crumbling infrastructure. America is a nation of builders.  We built the Empire State Building in just 1 year \u2013 is it not a disgrace that it can now take 10 years just to get a permit approved for a simple road? I am asking both parties to come together to give us the safe, fast, reliable, and modern infrastructure our economy needs and our people deserve. Tonight, I am calling on the Congress to produce a bill that generates at least $1.5 trillion for the new infrastructure investment we need. Every Federal dollar should be leveraged by partnering with State and local governments and, where appropriate, tapping into private sector investment \u2013 to permanently fix the infrastructure deficit. Any bill must also streamline the permitting and approval process \u2013 getting it down to no more than two years, and perhaps even one. Together, we can reclaim our building heritage.  We will build gleaming new roads, bridges, highways, railways, and waterways across our land.  And we will do it with American heart, American hands, and American grit. We want every American to know the dignity of a hard day\u2019s work.  We want every child to be safe in their home at night.  And we want every citizen to be proud of this land that we love. We can lift our citizens from welfare to work, from dependence to independence, and from poverty to prosperity. As tax cuts create new jobs, let us invest in workforce development and job training.  Let us open great vocational schools so our future workers can learn a craft and realize their full potential.  And let us support working families by supporting paid family leave. As America regains its strength, this opportunity must be extended to all citizens.  That is why this year we will embark on reforming our prisons to help former inmates who have served their time get a second chance. Struggling communities, especially immigrant communities, will also be helped by immigration policies that focus on the best interests of American workers and American families. For decades, open borders have allowed drugs and gangs to pour into our most vulnerable communities.  They have allowed millions of low-wage workers to compete for jobs and wages against the poorest Americans.  Most tragically, they have caused the loss of many innocent lives. Here tonight are two fathers and two mothers:  Evelyn Rodriguez, Freddy Cuevas, Elizabeth Alvarado, and Robert Mickens.  Their two teenage daughters \u2013 Kayla Cuevas and Nisa Mickens \u2013 were close friends on Long Island.  But in September 2016, on the eve of Nisa\u2019s 16th Birthday, neither of them came home.  These two precious girls were brutally murdered while walking together in their hometown.  Six members of the savage gang MS-13 have been charged with Kayla and Nisa\u2019s murders.  Many of these gang members took advantage of glaring loopholes in our laws to enter the country as unaccompanied alien minors \u2011- and wound up in Kayla and Nisa\u2019s high school. Evelyn, Elizabeth, Freddy, and Robert:  Tonight, everyone in this chamber is praying for you.  Everyone in America is grieving for you.  And 320 million hearts are breaking for you.  We cannot imagine the depth of your sorrow, but we can make sure that other families never have to endure this pain. Tonight, I am calling on the Congress to finally close the deadly loopholes that have allowed MS-13, and other criminals, to break into our country.  We have proposed new legislation that will fix our immigration laws, and support our ICE and Border Patrol Agents, so that this cannot ever happen again. The United States is a compassionate nation.  We are proud that we do more than any other country to help the needy, the struggling, and the underprivileged all over the world.  But as President of the United States, my highest loyalty, my greatest compassion, and my constant concern is for America\u2019s children, America\u2019s struggling workers, and America\u2019s forgotten communities.  I want our youth to grow up to achieve great things.  I want our poor to have their chance to rise. So tonight, I am extending an open hand to work with members of both parties \u2013 Democrats and Republicans \u2013 to protect our citizens of every background, color, religion, and creed.  My duty, and the sacred duty of every elected official in this chamber, is to defend Americans \u2013 to protect their safety, their families, their communities, and their right to the American Dream.  Because Americans are dreamers too. Here tonight is one leader in the effort to defend our country:  Homeland Security Investigations Special Agent Celestino Martinez \u2013 he goes by CJ.  CJ served 15 years in the Air Force before becoming an ICE agent and spending the last 15 years fighting gang violence and getting dangerous criminals off our streets.  At one point, MS-13 leaders ordered CJ\u2019s murder.  But he did not cave to threats or fear.  Last May, he commanded an operation to track down gang members on Long Island.  His team has arrested nearly 400, including more than 220 from MS-13. CJ:  Great work.  Now let us get the Congress to send you some reinforcements. Over the next few weeks, the House and Senate will be voting on an immigration reform package. In recent months, my Administration has met extensively with both Democrats and Republicans to craft a bipartisan approach to immigration reform.  Based on these discussions, we presented the Congress with a detailed proposal that should be supported by both parties as a fair compromise \u2013 one where nobody gets everything they want, but where our country gets the critical reforms it needs. Here are the four pillars of our plan: The first pillar of our framework generously offers a path to citizenship for 1.8 million illegal immigrants who were brought here by their parents at a young age \u2013 that covers almost three times more people than the previous administration.  Under our plan, those who meet education and work requirements, and show good moral character, will be able to become full citizens of the United States. The second pillar fully secures the border.  That means building a wall on the Southern border, and it means hiring more heroes like CJ to keep our communities safe.  Crucially, our plan closes the terrible loopholes exploited by criminals and terrorists to enter our country \u2013 and it finally ends the dangerous practice of \u201ccatch and release.\u201d The third pillar ends the visa lottery \u2013 a program that randomly hands out green cards without any regard for skill, merit, or the safety of our people.  It is time to begin moving towards a merit-based immigration system \u2013 one that admits people who are skilled, who want to work, who will contribute to our society, and who will love and respect our country. The fourth and final pillar protects the nuclear family by ending chain migration.  Under the current broken system, a single immigrant can bring in virtually unlimited numbers of distant relatives.  Under our plan, we focus on the immediate family by limiting sponsorships to spouses and minor children.  This vital reform is necessary, not just for our economy, but for our security, and our future. In recent weeks, two terrorist attacks in New York were made possible by the visa lottery and chain migration.  In the age of terrorism, these programs present risks we can no longer afford. It is time to reform these outdated immigration rules, and finally bring our immigration system into the 21st century. These four pillars represent a down-the-middle compromise, and one that will create a safe, modern, and lawful immigration system. For over 30 years, Washington has tried and failed to solve this problem.  This Congress can be the one that finally makes it happen. Most importantly, these four pillars will produce legislation that fulfills my ironclad pledge to only sign a bill that puts America first.  So let us come together, set politics aside, and finally get the job done. These reforms will also support our response to the terrible crisis of opioid and drug addiction. In 2016, we lost 64,000 Americans to drug overdoses:  174 deaths per day.  Seven per hour.  We must get much tougher on drug dealers and pushers if we are going to succeed in stopping this scourge. My Administration is committed to fighting the drug epidemic and helping get treatment for those in need.  The struggle will be long and difficult \u2013 but, as Americans always do, we will prevail. As we have seen tonight, the most difficult challenges bring out the best in America. We see a vivid expression of this truth in the story of the Holets family of New Mexico.  Ryan Holets is 27 years old, and an officer with the Albuquerque Police Department.  He is here tonight with his wife Rebecca.  Last year, Ryan was on duty when he saw a pregnant, homeless woman preparing to inject heroin.  When Ryan told her she was going to harm her unborn child, she began to weep.  She told him she did not know where to turn, but badly wanted a safe home for her baby. In that moment, Ryan said he felt God speak to him:  \u201cYou will do it \u2013 because you can.\u201d  He took out a picture of his wife and their four kids.  Then, he went home to tell his wife Rebecca.  In an instant, she agreed to adopt.  The Holets named their new daughter Hope. Ryan and Rebecca:  You embody the goodness of our Nation.  Thank you, and congratulations. As we rebuild America\u2019s strength and confidence at home, we are also restoring our strength and standing abroad. Around the world, we face rogue regimes, terrorist groups, and rivals like China and Russia that challenge our interests, our economy, and our values.  In confronting these dangers, we know that weakness is the surest path to conflict, and unmatched power is the surest means of our defense. For this reason, I am asking the Congress to end the dangerous defense sequester and fully fund our great military. As part of our defense, we must modernize and rebuild our nuclear arsenal, hopefully never having to use it, but making it so strong and powerful that it will deter any acts of aggression.  Perhaps someday in the future there will be a magical moment when the countries of the world will get together to eliminate their nuclear weapons.  Unfortunately, we are not there yet. Last year, I also pledged that we would work with our allies to extinguish ISIS from the face of the Earth.  One year later, I am proud to report that the coalition to defeat ISIS has liberated almost 100 percent of the territory once held by these killers in Iraq and Syria.  But there is much more work to be done.  We will continue our fight until ISIS is defeated. Army Staff Sergeant Justin Peck is here tonight.  Near Raqqa last November, Justin and his comrade, Chief Petty Officer Kenton Stacy, were on a mission to clear buildings that ISIS had rigged with explosives so that civilians could return to the city. Clearing the second floor of a vital hospital, Kenton Stacy was severely wounded by an explosion.  Immediately, Justin bounded into the booby-trapped building and found Kenton in bad shape.  He applied pressure to the wound and inserted a tube to reopen an airway.  He then performed CPR for 20 straight minutes during the ground transport and maintained artificial respiration through 2 hours of emergency surgery. Kenton Stacy would have died if not for Justin\u2019s selfless love for a fellow warrior.  Tonight, Kenton is recovering in Texas.  Raqqa is liberated.  And Justin is wearing his new Bronze Star, with a \u201cV\u201d for \u201cValor.\u201d  Staff Sergeant Peck:  All of America salutes you. Terrorists who do things like place bombs in civilian hospitals are evil.  When possible, we annihilate them.  When necessary, we must be able to detain and question them.  But we must be clear:  Terrorists are not merely criminals.  They are unlawful enemy combatants.  And when captured overseas, they should be treated like the terrorists they are. In the past, we have foolishly released hundreds of dangerous terrorists, only to meet them again on the battlefield \u2013 including the ISIS leader, al-Baghdadi. So today, I am keeping another promise.  I just signed an order directing Secretary Mattis to reexamine our military detention policy and to keep open the detention facilities at Guant\u00e1namo Bay. I am also asking the Congress to ensure that, in the fight against ISIS and al-Qa\u2019ida, we continue to have all necessary power to detain terrorists \u2013 wherever we chase them down. Our warriors in Afghanistan also have new rules of engagement.  Along with their heroic Afghan partners, our military is no longer undermined by artificial timelines, and we no longer tell our enemies our plans. Last month, I also took an action endorsed unanimously by the Senate just months before:  I recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. Shortly afterwards, dozens of countries voted in the United Nations General Assembly against America\u2019s sovereign right to make this recognition.  American taxpayers generously send those same countries billions of dollars in aid every year. That is why, tonight, I am asking the Congress to pass legislation to help ensure American foreign-assistance dollars always serve American interests, and only go to America\u2019s friends. As we strengthen friendships around the world, we are also restoring clarity about our adversaries. When the people of Iran rose up against the crimes of their corrupt dictatorship, I did not stay silent.  America stands with the people of Iran in their courageous struggle for freedom. I am asking the Congress to address the fundamental flaws in the terrible Iran nuclear deal. My Administration has also imposed tough sanctions on the communist and socialist dictatorships in Cuba and Venezuela. But no regime has oppressed its own citizens more totally or brutally than the cruel dictatorship in North Korea. North Korea\u2019s reckless pursuit of nuclear missiles could very soon threaten our homeland. We are waging a campaign of maximum pressure to prevent that from happening. Past experience has taught us that complacency and concessions only invite aggression and provocation.  I will not repeat the mistakes of past administrations that got us into this dangerous position. We need only look at the depraved character of the North Korean regime to understand the nature of the nuclear threat it could pose to America and our allies. Otto Warmbier was a hardworking student at the University of Virginia.  On his way to study abroad in Asia, Otto joined a tour to North Korea.  At its conclusion, this wonderful young man was arrested and charged with crimes against the state.  After a shameful trial, the dictatorship sentenced Otto to 15 years of hard labor, before returning him to America last June \u2013 horribly injured and on the verge of death.  He passed away just days after his return. Otto\u2019s Parents, Fred and Cindy Warmbier, are with us tonight \u2013 along with Otto\u2019s brother and sister, Austin and Greta.  You are powerful witnesses to a menace that threatens our world, and your strength inspires us all.  Tonight, we pledge to honor Otto\u2019s memory with American resolve. Finally, we are joined by one more witness to the ominous nature of this regime.  His name is Mr. Ji Seong-ho. In 1996, Seong-ho was a starving boy in North Korea.  One day, he tried to steal coal from a railroad car to barter for a few scraps of food.  In the process, he passed out on the train tracks, exhausted from hunger.  He woke up as a train ran over his limbs.  He then endured multiple amputations without anything to dull the pain.  His brother and sister gave what little food they had to help him recover and ate dirt themselves \u2013 permanently stunting their own growth.  Later, he was tortured by North Korean authorities after returning from a brief visit to China.  His tormentors wanted to know if he had met any Christians.  He had \u2013 and he resolved to be free. Seong-ho traveled thousands of miles on crutches across China and Southeast Asia to freedom.  Most of his family followed.  His father was caught trying to escape, and was tortured to death. Today he lives in Seoul, where he rescues other defectors, and broadcasts into North Korea what the regime fears the most \u2011- the truth. Today he has a new leg, but Seong-ho, I understand you still keep those crutches as a reminder of how far you have come.  Your great sacrifice is an inspiration to us all. Seong-ho\u2019s story is a testament to the yearning of every human soul to live in freedom. It was that same yearning for freedom that nearly 250 years ago gave birth to a special place called America.  It was a small cluster of colonies caught between a great ocean and a vast wilderness.  But it was home to an incredible people with a revolutionary idea:  that they could rule themselves.  That they could chart their own destiny.  And that, together, they could light up the world. That is what our country has always been about.  That is what Americans have always stood for, always strived for, and always done. Atop the dome of this Capitol stands the Statue of Freedom.  She stands tall and dignified among the monuments to our ancestors who fought and lived and died to protect her. Monuments to Washington and Jefferson \u2013 to Lincoln and King. Memorials to the heroes of Yorktown and Saratoga \u2013 to young Americans who shed their blood on the shores of Normandy, and the fields beyond.  And others, who went down in the waters of the Pacific and the skies over Asia. And freedom stands tall over one more monument:  this one.  This Capitol.  This living monument to the American people. A people whose heroes live not only in the past, but all around us \u2013 defending hope, pride, and the American way. They work in every trade.  They sacrifice to raise a family.  They care for our children at home.  They defend our flag abroad.  They are strong moms and brave kids.  They are firefighters, police officers, border agents, medics, and Marines. But above all else, they are Americans.  And this Capitol, this city, and this Nation, belong to them. Our task is to respect them, to listen to them, to serve them, to protect them, and to always be worthy of them. Americans fill the world with art and music.  They push the bounds of science and discovery.  And they forever remind us of what we should never forget:  The people dreamed this country. The people built this country.  And it is the people who are making America great again. As long as we are proud of who we are, and what we are fighting for, there is nothing we cannot achieve. As long as we have confidence in our values, faith in our citizens, and trust in our God, we will not fail. Our families will thrive. Our people will prosper. And our Nation will forever be safe and strong and proud and mighty and free. Thank you, and God bless America.

            "article_content": "Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin on Tuesday disputed claims that the Trump administration punted on moving forward with fresh sanctions against Russia over its interference in the 2016 US election. Appearing before the Senate Banking Committee, Mnuchin assured lawmakers that additional sanctions would be imposed in the \u201cnear future\u201d following a detailed report provided to Congress shortly before a midnight deadline on Monday. \u201cIn the near future, you will see additional sanctions,\u201d said Mnuchin. The secretary stopped short of providing guidance on how soon those sanctions could be applied, but said the department is already \u201cworking on it.\u201d Throughout the two-and-half hour hearing, Mnuchin offered a robust defense of the administration\u2019s actions Monday, calling it \u201ca very unfair characterization\u201d that it had chosen to delay the Russia sanctions. US names Russian oligarchs in 'Putin list' but imposes no new sanctions \u201cWe did not waive or delay,\u201d Mnuchin said. He said Treasury had met its statutory obligation by delivering its report to Congress by a deadline to list every senior member of the political administration at the Kremlin and every Russian oligarch with a net worth of $1 billion or more. The classified report will serve as the basis for future sanctions by the administration, he said: \u201cThere will be sanctions that come out of this report.\u201d The secretary said the \u201cintention was not to have sanctions by the delivery of the report last night, but rather to do an extremely thorough analysis. It was hundreds of pages,\u201d referring to a classified list of names that lawmakers also received. The Russia 'sanctions list' won't have worried anyone in Moscow Sen. Bob Corker, a Tennessee Republican who\u2019s a lead author of the law that required the report, said he was encouraged by the steps taken so far by the US government based on a classified briefing. \u201cOn the whole, it is clear the administration is working in good faith, and I am committed to applying pressure, as needed, to ensure further implementation,\u201d  Corker said in a statement. But the so-called oligarchs\u2019 list drew sharp criticism. It was \u201ca missed opportunity and a disappointment,\u201d said Daniel Fried, a former assistant secretary of state for European and Eurasian affairs and former ambassador to Poland. Fried said the catalog of names was \u201cnot a particularly quality list\u201d and seemed to have been \u201cassembled in haste.\u201d It could have been better used to exert pressure on the Russian ruling class, he said. The 'Putin list': A Who's Who of Russia's political and business elite The list included 114 senior political figures with close ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin, including his chief spokesman, Dimitry Peskov, Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov and Prime Minister Dmitry Medvedev. An additional 96 oligarchs with a net worth of $1 billion or more were also publicly named in the report. They included the aluminum magnate Oleg Deripaska, Chelsea football club owner Roman Abramovich and the media and tech magnate Alisher Usmanov. While the publicized names were \u201cnot a particularly quality list,\u201d Fried said that the classified list \u201cmight have significant deterrent value.\u201d Andrew Keller, a former deputy assistant secretary of state for sanctions and counter threat finance, agreed. Mattis has a crucial task -- stopping Trump from going to war with North Korea The report \u201csimply lists individuals with a net worth of over 1 billion USD. The report clearly states what we knew all along, namely that it\u2019s not a sanction or a determination that listed individuals will be sanctioned,\u201d said Keller, now a partner at Hogan Lovells, an international law firm. \u201cWhat we don\u2019t know is what\u2019s most relevant \u2013 whether the classified annex includes any information on links to corruption and on the potential impact of imposing US sanctions on listed individuals, both of which are required by the statute.\u201d A Treasury spokesman said the names of senior political figures and oligarchs were \u201cbased on objective criteria drawn from publicly available sources,\u201d including names compiled by Forbes magazine last year. \u201cThere is not a statutory or regulatory definition of oligarch, so Treasury included the $1 billion threshold as a reasonable number, which is the criteria contained in the US Forbes list,\u201d the Treasury spokesman told CNN. Some of those named are already subject to US sanctions and the administration did not impose any new punishments. The report was \u201cnot a sanctions list,\u201d Treasury said. US military says 'human error' caused blocking of key Afghanistan info The Trump administration was required to publish the list by the Countering America\u2019s Adversaries Through Sanctions Act, which was meant to punish Russia for its interference in the 2016 US election, as well as alleged human rights violations, the annexation of Crimea and ongoing military operations in eastern Ukraine. It was supported by Democrats and Republicans who wanted to try to prevent President Donald Trump from watering down US sanctions on Russia. The President described the act as \u201cseriously flawed\u201d when he signed it into law in August. Earlier Monday, the Trump administration declined to impose sanctions against companies and foreign countries doing business with blacklisted Russian defense and intelligence entities, a consideration required by the law. \u201cSanctions on specific entities or individuals will not need to be imposed because the legislation is, in fact, serving as a deterrent,\u201d a State Department official said. State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said the legislation had already deterred Russian defense sales. \u201cSince the enactment of the CAATSA legislation, we estimate that foreign governments have abandoned planned or announced purchases of several billion dollars in Russian defense acquisitions,\u201d she said in a statement.",

The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion articles on CNN. Every debate in presidential politics is a make-or-break, do-or-die opportunity for candidates. The stakes are extremely high and the cost of a gaffe or a poor performance could crush a campaign. Just think back to the 2012 Republican primary debate when former Texas governor Rick Perry\u2019s \u201coops\u201d moment crippled his candidacy. The benefits of a stellar debate showing, however, can lead to the crown jewel of presidential campaigns: momentum. A strong performance can also lead to bolstered poll numbers, key endorsements, rock star status on social media and a groundswell of fresh campaign donations that could fill a candidate\u2019s war chest with millions. Kamala Harris shows potential strength in 2020 primary In 2020, debates will arguably matter more for Democrats than they have in any recent presidential primary process. With a far-reaching field of potentially 20 to 30 Democrats jockeying for the nomination,  contenders will reflect an expansive range of Democratic ideas and brands. The Democratic party is facing an existential crisis, with some arguing that a centrist stance is a stale and pandering one that cost the party in the 2016 election. Outgoing Sen. Claire McCaskill of Missouri, however, told CNN the party needs to deliver real solutions to attract independent and white working class voters, rather than pushing idealistic policy ideas that have little chance of succeeding. \u201cThe rhetoric is cheap. Getting results is a lot harder,\u201d she said. As we barrel ahead toward 2020, one thing is clear \u2013 Democrats must move beyond their current position as the anti-Trump party and reach a consensus message and comprehensive platform. As such, the primary contest will be nothing short of a battle of ideas, as candidates fight for the heart and soul of the Democratic Party. The best platform to stage this battle? Debates. Lots and lots of them. Already the DNC has come out with its number of officially sanctioned debates: a dozen. The problem? With such a broad field of Democrats and talk of a split system that fractures the candidate field into two debate lineups, 12 televised brawls might not be nearly enough. In 2016, Democrats had a mere six primary debates, with the party largely split between Sen. Bernie Sanders and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. Republicans, on the other hand, had twice the number of debates as candidates engaged in a prolonged conflict, hashing out their differing personalities and ideas in a series of raw, brutal, and sometimes cringeworthy debates. McCaskill warns Dems about 'cheap' rhetoric; says GOP senators privately believe Trump is 'nuts' The lack of an early consensus or coronation in the GOP helped spawn a competitive primary. In the end, the GOP\u2019s wide-ranging primary death match produced Donald Trump as its nominee. And, unfortunately for Democrats, he became president. A robust primary field of candidates, along with a myriad of debates, isn\u2019t necessarily the secret sauce that guarantees victory for one party in a presidential contest. But it\u2019s an effective way to assess the differing visions for our country and determine how to move forward. With so many Democrats likely to run, and no political harmony within the party\u2019s broader tent, primary voters, grassroots activists, state party leaders, organized labor, environmentalists, among others on the left, should demand more than a dozen debates. The more the merrier. We can, and should, engage in an in-depth, extended conversation about what we, collectively as Democrats, stand for. Are we the party of Medicare for All, or just protecting and improving the Affordable Care Act? Do we believe in putting our nation on a path to 100% renewable energy, or should we put forth a mix of laws that address climate change and prioritize renewable energy while still embracing some fossil fuels? Do we believe in free college tuition or simply bringing down the cost of higher education? Do we support free trade or fair trade? Should we support all-or-nothing politics or instead compromise from time to time?  In the aftermath of the 2018 midterm election, Democrats have no shortage of energy, political agendas or ideologies. It\u2019s not a question of enthusiasm. As Democrats, we seem to have maintained that asset, thanks in part to President Trump. The question, instead, as we gear up for one of the most historic and important modern presidential elections, is whether there is an appetite for the battle of ideas that we desperately need in order find out who we are as a Democratic Party. This battle of ideas will hopefully lead to a nationally unified message. Without it, the Democrats will remain fractured and unable to take on Donald Trump in the 2020 election. Only after a more sustained political dogfight and aggressive debate schedule will the strongest candidate emerge to take back the White House.",

View more opinion articles on CNN. Democrats won big in this year\u2019s midterm elections. We put hope on the ballot and voters across the country embraced our message, turning out in droves to elect the most diverse slate of candidates in history. It was a powerful repudiation of Donald Trump and the Republican politicians who march in lockstep behind him. In response, GOP leaders could have used these losses as points of reflection to figure out what\u2019s broken within their ranks and why the American people rejected their agenda. Instead, Republican lawmakers have been engaged in a cynical and hypocritical power grab to overrule the will of the voters. This is a profoundly troubling assault on the very foundations of our democracy. In Wisconsin, lawmakers have used their lame-duck legislative session to pass new restrictions on early voting \u2013 an obvious attempt to reduce turnout among Democrats in the future. They\u2019ve also passed a law to weaken the powers of Gov.-elect Tony Evers and Attorney General-elect Josh Kaul, in an effort to limit Democratic influence on future laws and prevent the state from withdrawing an anti-Obamacare lawsuit that seeks to remove protections for people with preexisting conditions. Stunning state power grabs expose a GOP uneasy with democracy itself In Michigan, a similar story is unfolding. With a new Democratic governor, attorney general and secretary of state soon to take the oath of office, Republican lawmakers have aggressively moved to limit their governing powers. Secretary of State-elect, Jocelyn Benson, who campaigned on a promise to prioritize election transparency, may be stripped of her ability to enforce campaign finance law. That power would be handed to a newly created Fair Political Practices Commission, which would ostensibly not share Benson\u2019s priorities. Similar measures are being taken to try and shift authority from the new governor and attorney general to the Republican-controlled Legislature. Meanwhile, in North Carolina, the FBI is investigating allegations that an operative working for Republican Mark Harris, who won the 9th Congressional District House seat by just over 900 votes, committed absentee ballot fraud. Many Republicans who have championed the passage of harsh voter ID laws in North Carolina and elsewhere across the country have been largely silent now that it looks like their allies are the true threat to the integrity of our elections. It wasn\u2019t long ago that President Trump was making claims without evidence that his failure to win the popular vote was the result of millions of fraudulent votes. And it was only last month that Republican senators like Marco Rubio were crying foul over non-existent voter fraud in Florida. Now that we may have real evidence of election fraud within their party, their passion for the issue seems to have totally dissipated. The message is clear: Donald Trump and Republican leaders care more about clinging to power than protecting the voice of their constituents. North Carolina election probe exposes GOP hypocrisy But the American people also sent a clear message last month: Republican leadership has failed. We demand accountability; we demand change. The GOP still refuses to listen. They\u2019ve chosen to double down and abuse their power in the days before a new class of Democrats takes office. And, in doing so, they\u2019re undermining our democracy and threatening everything we value as Americans. It\u2019s also worth noting that this win-at-any-cost attitude within the ranks of the GOP didn\u2019t form overnight. For years, Republicans have schemed to suppress Democratic turnout with racially targeted voter ID laws and aggressively gerrymandered districts. They have chipped away at our institutions with an eye on consolidating and entrenching their power, regardless of the will of the American people.  Now that Democrats have taken back the House, and a number of governorships and state legislative chambers, we\u2019ll be able to restore some of the fairness, integrity, and accountability that Americans deserve from their leaders. But we shouldn\u2019t be the only political party working toward these ideals. There are, without question, Republicans of good conscience who are frustrated and angry with what their fellow party members are doing. They should stand up and speak out now. A good conscience does not alone make change. It must be paired with action. Republicans, don\u2019t break our democracy. Fix your broken political party.",

The opinions expressed in this commentary are those of the author. View more opinion articles on CNN. President George H.W. Bush embodied a value that seems to be vanishing from our nation: public service. Love or hate his politics, most politicians who worked with Bush valued his deep commitment to government. And few would challenge the argument that he devoted his entire life to the public arena. He was part of a generation in American politics when working for the government was a virtue, not a vice. His career was remarkable. After serving in World War II and later making millions in the oil business, Bush entered the rough world of politics in 1966 when Texas voters elected him to the US House of Representatives. Five years later, President Richard Nixon appointed him to be the Ambassador to the United Nations. He took over as the chairman of the Republican National Committee in 1973, a difficult time, as Watergate was breaking. Nonetheless, he proved effective and his career boomed. President Gerald Ford appointed Bush to be the ambassador to China and then in 1976 made him director of the CIA. But Bush was also interested in seeking higher office, and ran in the Republican primaries in 1980, losing to Ronald Reagan, but winning election as vice president. When Reagan finished his second term, Bush defeated Massachusetts Michael Dukakis in 1988 to become President of the United States. He would not win reelection, losing to Bill Clinton in 1992, but Bush remained active in the public eye teaming up with his predecessors \u2013 including Clinton \u2013 to raise money for disaster relief. Anderson Cooper remembers George H.W. Bush In politics, Bush was not above going low.  During the 1988 campaign, for instance, he helped open the door to some of the nastier elements in our modern political world, such as Lee Atwater\u2019s cut-throat campaign style that capitalized on division as a path to victory. But Bush also was not always successful at what he set out to do. He lost reelection in 1992 because he proved to have a tin ear toward the economic struggles of middle class Americans. The history books look back kindly on other aspects of his presidency. He took a huge political gamble by pushing a major deficit reduction bill in 1990, for example and he handled the collapse of the Soviet Union with the adroit skill necessary to ensure that US political leaders did not bungle the end of the Cold War. On domestic policy, he repeatedly proved that he was willing to break with the most conservative elements of his party, even as their clout increased on Capitol Hill. Despite the rightward drift of his party, he gave his support to environmental and civil rights legislation. Newt Gingrich \u2013 in 1990 the No. 2 Republican in the House \u2013 never forgave Bush for agreeing to raise taxes that year, though the deficit reduction package would become a major legacy of his administration. On foreign policy, Bush demonstrated restraint as the hawks in his party were beating the drums for the US to maintain an aggressive stance. When President Bush did use force in Operation Desert Storm he insisted on pulling back US forces after the mission of freeing Kuwait was completed. But what is most striking about Bush\u2019s life, beyond the policies or the politics, was the fact that this man believed so firmly in the virtue of serving government. He was a civil servant to the core at a time that his own party was smashing government as inefficient and even corrupt. Hear Obamas' statement on George H.W. Bush death Reagan called government the problem, not the solution, yet his vice president made government his professional home. Bush believed in the power of political leaders to help usher the nation and the world through big changes. Not only was he a politician to the core, but he was notably a father who raised two sons who served as governors \u2013 with one going on to become President. We need more of George H. W. Bush\u2019s spirit in this country today. We live at a moment in history when the values that he represented seem to have been jettisoned, with a President who often makes a mockery of the institutions he governs. On the sad occasion of Bush\u2019s death, it is a good time to raise a toast to people such as him, Republicans and Democrats, who understand that what happens in Washington plays a massive role in the quality of our lives.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Congressman Ben Ray Luj\u00e1n, a Democrat, is from New Mexico. He was appointed to the House Democratic Leadership as a Chief Deputy Whip in 2013, served as chair of the the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee in the 2016 cycle and was elected by his colleagues to serve again as DCCC chair in the 2018 midterms. He is running unopposed for the position of assistant Democratic leader in the upcoming Congress. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own; view more opinion at CNN. Two weeks ago, House Democrats delivered the party\u2019s best midterm performance since the post-Watergate election of 1974. Even with heavily Republican gerrymandered maps and a national popular vote advantage that experts considered lower than necessary to even flip the House, Democrats are on track to turn at least 39 seats from red to blue. As Chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, I spent a significant amount of time this cycle traveling throughout the country making a personal case to supporters about our candidates. I know firsthand how Democrats achieved our historic victory, and what it will take to build on this success heading into 2020. Throughout my time on the road, there was one constant: Nancy Pelosi. She was strong, passionate and persuasive. She always showed up, always took the time, always made the case better than anyone else about how consequential these midterms were. In ways seen and unseen, Pelosi was integral in setting up our Democratic Party for success on the campaign trail. For one, she was overwhelmingly our best fundraiser, raising roughly half of the DCCC\u2019s cycle haul and helping us build resources at levels never before seen in a midterm election. Battle-tested, she used her voice to keep the national conversation focused on things that mattered to the American people: health care, real middle class tax reform, protecting Medicare and Social Security and growing our economy to increase wages.  Working closely with our messaging leads, she \u2013 and our colleagues and candidates \u2013 took our \u201cFor The People\u201d message to the people. And it worked. How two GOP governors surfed the blue wave She did all this while balancing an ideologically diverse Democratic caucus and the dangers posed by an erratic, impulsive President who constantly sought to distract from the personal conversation that Democrats were having with voters. But with laser focus and a \u201cJust Win, Baby\u201d mentality, Nancy Pelosi\u2019s achievements this year are historic. Democrats, think twice before you reject Nancy Pelosi It\u2019s important to note that this was all in the face of Republicans\u2019 desperate attacks against her character, backed up by millions of dollars. Not only did Pelosi persevere through those ugly and relentless attacks, a net of at least 39 seats have flipped from red to blue. It\u2019s clear that the Republicans\u2019 attacks are part of a tired and failed playbook. There\u2019s a reason it failed: Outside of Republicans\u2019 Beltway echo chamber, in competitive districts across America, voters simply didn\u2019t buy it. This midterm was deeply personal to voters across the country, and these Republican attacks failed to convey any personal impact on voters\u2019 lives.  Consistent with many past national and district-specific polls, an exit poll conducted by the Washington Post in battleground districts found Pelosi ranked dead last among the list of issues that mattered to voters, with 7% reporting Pelosi as important in their choice of candidate.  By contrast, President Trump was the most or second-most important factor for 42% of those interviewed. The simple truth is that House Republicans lost the majority because they could not defend their record on the issues that mattered most to voters: health care and prescription drugs, the GOP tax scam for the rich, and cleaning up corruption in Washington.  While Republicans spent their time and money talking about Pelosi, she was busy orchestrating the resources, mobilization and message discipline that threw the GOP majority into a headlong retreat from their votes on taxes and health care. Now we are in the majority, and this is a critical time for leadership and unity. With Nancy Pelosi as Speaker, House Democrats will pass bold legislation to deliver on the commitments of our For The People agenda.",

Yes, now that the Democrats have taken control of the House of Representatives, they get to serve as committee chairs and that gives them the power of issuing subpoenas all by themselves.  And, yes, Democrats can subpoena President Trump\u2019s tax returns, as they almost certainly will, and should \u2013 there is much of potential interest in those returns, materially connected to Trump\u2019s possible conflicts of interest, foreign entanglements, and more. And, yes, Trump can oppose the subpoenas, and fight them in court, and it will be up to non-elected judges to decide the issue in the end.  Meanwhile, our reality-TV-world of politics will breathlessly cover the twists and turns of the tale, as they already have begun to do. But the Democrats got a much more important power on Election Day, one directly connected to the present and future well-being of all Americans.  The US Constitution, in its so-called Origination Clause, provides that any law for raising revenue \u2013 taxes \u2013 must begin in the House.  House Democrats, who won their majority largely by hewing to pocketbook issues such as healthcare and taxes, can do some real governance by using their power to tax to propose actual tax legislation. Who really won the midterm elections? What might this look like?  Without getting into the weeds, there are two broad approaches to take.  One, Democrats can propose a real, and fiscally responsible, middle class tax cut \u2013 one that gives real benefits to working Americans and is paid for by asking for some payments from the wealthiest, who can now, like Jared Kushner, avoid all taxes. Two, the Democrats can propose legislation that actually shuts down loopholes that the rich, like Kushner and his father-in-law, use to dodge paying taxes.  Sure, any such tax bill would be unlikely to get 50 votes in the Senate, or to get signed by President Trump, or to have a two-thirds majority in either chamber to override a presidential veto.  So what?  Both types of legislation would be good for the people right now, and Democrats would simply be doing their job, as they were elected to do, with either approach. Republican opposition to either type of bill would only give the lie to the idea that Republicans care about average Americans when it comes to their tax policies or to protecting entitlements such as Social Security and Medicare. Entitlement programs are relevant because when tax policy creates deficits, as the Trump tax cut did, it puts all government spending programs at risk. Proposing good tax policies to help average Americans and to rein in the excesses of the wealthiest might not be as sexy and headline-grabbing as a relentless quest for the holy grail of Trump\u2019s tax returns.  But good tax proposals would reflect Democrats exercising their Constitutional role to help the people who elected them with real issues, affecting real money.  That would make for a better reality for all Americans, not just better reality television.",

The opinions expressed in this commentary are his. Bless your soul, Mick Mulvaney, for spelling out so clearly and succinctly the evil that drives Washington.  As the former congressman and now interim director of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau explained to bankers on Tuesday, \u201cWe had a hierarchy in my office in Congress.  If you\u2019re a lobbyist who never gave us money, I didn\u2019t talk to you. If you\u2019re a lobbyist who gave us money, I might talk to you.\u201d Yes, Mulvaney would also meet his constituents from back home, whom he insists were at the top of the hierarchy. America is a pay-to-play political system.  When the lobbyists pay up, they\u2019re at the table.  And to be sure, the big boys now run the show.  The result is a political system among the most corrupt in the world, but with a twist of genius: the US Supreme Court has for all intents and purposes legalized the corruption and thereby put American democracy on a downward death spiral. The system works like this. America\u2019s business interests, upper classes and white population have long made it hard for the poor and working class to register to vote.  In most other democracies, voter registration is not the responsibility of individual voters, but is more or less automatic. Unlike these other democracies, US elections are a game of voter turnout, not of substance. And voter turnout efforts are based heavily on money \u2013 big money \u2013 to run ads on TV and other media, buy voter data, manage expensive targeting of households, and other big-ticket strategies.  The 2016 federal election cycle saw at least $6.4 billion spent on federal campaigns, and that\u2019s not counting the anonymous corporate sums that are not reported. Congressmen live and breathe for campaign funds, and also to avoid crossing the interests of powerful corporate lobbies that might fund a primary challenger.  The result is that billionaires and powerful companies own and operate the US political system.  The vulgarity of the US situation would shock Karl Marx, who famously described 19th century democracy as a system in which \u201cthe oppressed are allowed every few years to decide which particular representatives of the oppressing class are to represent and repress them.\u201d Warren to Mulvaney: You're hurting real people The results are astounding.  Public policy in America has almost nothing to do with broad public opinion, a point that America\u2019s leading political scientists such as Benjamin Page and Martin Gilens have been making for years in sophisticated research in top, peer-reviewed journals and in their recent book \u201cDemocracy in America? What Has Gone Wrong and What Can We Do About It.\u201d Jane Mayer brought this home with flair in her account in \u201cDark Money,\u201d focusing especially on mega-billionaires David and Charles Koch, as well as the detailed account of hedge-fund billionaire Robert Mercer of Cambridge Analytica notoriety. So, the public wants gun control, but Washington delivers guns and mass shooting instead.  The public wants renewable energy, but Washington delivers EPA Chief Scott Pruitt and fossil fuels instead.  The public wants taxes on the rich, but Washington delivers massive tax cuts for the rich instead.  The public wants peace, but Washington and the military-industrial lobby deliver perpetual war instead.  The American people are not the problem; the billionaires and their greedy agenda are at the heart of the crisis. During the Obamacare debates a few years ago, when I asked a congresswoman why there was so little attempt by Congress to control soaring medical care prices, she buried her head in her hands and murmured \u201cthe lobbies! the lobbies!\u201d  It was like Kurtz in \u201cThe Heart of Darkness\u201d murmuring \u201cThe horror! the horror!\u201d Jon Stewart slams 9/11 health program proposal The Supreme Court\u2019s infamous decision in Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission will go down in US history alongside Dred Scott v. Sandford (1857) and Plessy v. Ferguson (1896) as among the worst moments in US jurisprudence.  In Citizens United, the Supreme Court basically gutted any control over corruption by eliminating nearly all restrictions on independent campaign spending by corporations, on the grounds that such restrictions violate the \u201cfree speech\u201d guarantee of the First Amendment. A system that was already corrupt up to the gills suddenly was essentially told, officially and at the highest level, that American democracy was hereafter being turned over to the highest bidder.  Evidently, Mulvaney knew well how to play the game, as he was showered with largesse from the financial industry. The Roberts Court is certainly one of the shoddiest in American history.  It followed up the Citizens United decision with McDonnell v. United States, declaring, in effect, that the blatant corruption of former Virginia Gov. Robert McDonnell and his wife could be seen merely as a politician interacting normally with his constituents.  McDonnell, duly convicted of bribery earlier by a jury of his peers, walked free after the Supreme Court ruling. In Citizens United, the court offered the following stunning claims: \u201cWe now conclude that independent expenditures, including those made by corporations, do not give rise to corruption or the appearance of corruption. \u2026 The appearance of influence or access, furthermore, will not cause the electorate to lose faith in our democracy.\u201d Showdown of dueling bosses at watchdog agency It would be hard to find a more inaccurate statement.  The public\u2019s confidence in American democracy has plummeted.  In a January 2018 survey, just 8% of Americans expressed \u201ca great deal of confidence\u201d in the Congress.  According to Gallup, the proportion of Americans expressing \u201ca great deal\u201d or \u201cquite a lot\u201d of confidence in Congress has declined from 30% in 2004 to just 12% in 2017. You have done your duty, Mulvaney, and now you and your ilk should resign in peace.  It is also urgent to challenge again in the courts the absurd claims of Citizens United before the confidence in our political institutions falls to zero.",

The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. On Tuesday, the Commerce Department announced that the US trade deficit had actually increased in 2017. During Donald Trump\u2019s first year as President, the US imported $566 billion more in goods and services than it exported \u2013 higher than any year since 2008. This flies in the face of the theory that, with the election of Donald Trump, US markets would suddenly become closed to global trade. Indeed, when considering President Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d trade policy, it is important to keep in mind two related points. First, it is unlikely that Trump is planning to launch a new era of American protectionism. As Trump has said, most recently at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, \u201c\u2018America First\u2019 does not mean \u2018America Alone.\u2019\u201d Second, Trump\u2019s trade policy does not represent a major break with our past. He is not looking to prevent trade but is seeking what he describes as reciprocity. Reciprocity in trade implies that as we grant access to our markets, we gain access to foreign markets. It is worth recalling that, when the United States turned away from protectionism in reaction to the disastrous Smoot-Hawley tariffs, Congress\u2019s first major trade bill was named \u201cThe Reciprocal Trade Agreement Act of 1934.\u201d Trump's support of India could have unintended consequences The Trump administration\u2019s recent decision to impose hefty tariffs on imported solar panels and washing machines, alongside ongoing negotiations over changes to the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), has led some to conclude that there has been a major shift in US trade policy, perhaps leading to a trade war with dire consequences for the world economy. The decision on solar panels and washing machines, however, followed a recommendation from the US International Trade Commission, which, right now, consists of three Obama appointees and one George W. Bush appointee. This same panel recently unanimously voted against approving tariffs against the Canadian airplane manufacturer Bombardier in response to a complaint from the Boeing corporation that the Canadian company had dumped underpriced, subsidized planes on the US market.  Rather than argue for a radical departure from past US practice, this seems more like a continuation of the mixed trade messages that Washington has been sending the world for the last few decades. Even President Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw from the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), though contrary to the Obama administration\u2019s position, is also not entirely original. During a panel at the recent Davos forum, Secretary of Commerce Wilbur Ross pushed back at the accusation that the United States\u2019 withdrawal from the TPP should be blamed on Trump. He argued, accurately, that \u201cthere was no political appetite in the United States in either party for TPP,\u201d citing Hillary Clinton\u2019s abandonment of TPP during her campaign. Gary Cohn: Trump shared a vision of economic progress in Davos It is obviously true that Trump\u2019s rhetoric on trade is different from what we have come to expect, not only from US politicians but from world leaders in general. When President Trump visited Davos, for example, he was surrounded by people who believe firmly in not only the existence but the fundamental importance of something called the \u201cglobal community.\u201d As a corollary, they also hold that this global community has interests and values that must be promoted by multinational institutions. At the same time, the community must be led, and if the United States does not lead, then some other country will. Trump clearly does not share this vision. But in rejecting \u201cthe world according to Davos,\u201d is the President really so out of sync with most Americans? A poll taken just prior to the 2016 election found that, among those who had heard of the TPP, 63% opposed the agreement. Curiously enough, only 29% of those polled had even heard of the agreement. Why, then, did both major party candidates feel the need to reject the TPP? I suspect that what appears to be a consensus on trade is tied to a larger rejection of the globalist worldview. Why stock market upheaval was inevitable Like most Americans, Trump approaches trade from the perspective that a president should only, can only, represent the views of citizens of his own country. I suspect that this is why Trump is inclined to prefer bilateral to multilateral trade agreements. On a practical level, in any one-on-one negotiation, the United States is likely to have a significant bargaining advantage. For instance, using World Bank data on GDP as a measure of economic clout, Japan, the largest economy in the TPP, has a GDP that is roughly 27% that of the United States. Combined, however, the GDP of all of the countries currently in the TPP is twice as large, totaling about 55% of America\u2019s GDP. Now that the 11 remaining TPP members have decided to move forward together, of course, the equation changes. Perhaps this is what has led the President to seemingly reconsider his decision on TPP. Trump\u2019s trade representatives are bringing this same perspective to the current NAFTA negotiations, relying on the overall size of the US market to leverage a revised agreement that is more favorable to US domestic businesses. So far, however, Trump has not triggered the withdrawal provisions available under existing NAFTA provisions.  So, for those looking for signs of where America is headed in the future, it is important to understand just how much Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica First\u201d idea resonates, not just with working class voters, but with the US electorate in general (and maybe, after the Brexit vote, not just American voters). It is therefore likely that Trump\u2019s basic orientation, if not his rhetoric, will remain part of US policy long after the current occupant of 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue returns to his tower in New York.

            "article_content": "Whether you know it or not, Obamacare has affected nearly every American. The Affordable Care Act does far more than allow millions of people to get health insurance through exchanges or Medicaid expansion. It saves senior citizens money on their Medicare coverage and prescription drugs. It lets many Americans obtain free birth control, mammograms and cholesterol tests. It requires many restaurants to post the calorie counts of their menu items. And it allows children to stay on their parents\u2019 health insurance plans until they turn 26. Obamacare enrollment ends today despite judge striking down law Even the Trump administration is using the landmark health reform law to try to lower prescription drug prices. And most importantly for many folks, Obamacare prevents insurers from turning away or charging more to those with pre-existing conditions. This provision proved so popular that even Republican candidates found themselves promising to defend it in the recent midterm election in an unsuccessful bid to retain their majority in the House. Some 52 million people, or 27% of non-elderly adults, have a pre-existing condition that would have prevented them from getting coverage prior to Obamacare, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. \u201cYou\u2019d be hard pressed to find a part of the health care system that was not touched by the ACA,\u201d said Larry Levitt, the foundation\u2019s senior vice president, of the Affordable Care Act. Federal judge in Texas strikes down Affordable Care Act All this, however, could be swept away by a US District Court judge in Texas, who ruled Friday that the Affordable Care Act\u2019s individual coverage mandate is unconstitutional and that the rest of the law therefore cannot stand. It seeks to accomplish what Republicans have tried to do for years: repeal Obamacare. The decision, which is expected to be appealed, doesn\u2019t immediately affect Americans\u2019 coverage. But if it\u2019s upheld by higher courts, it could turn back the clock on the nation\u2019s health care system to before Obamacare became the law of the land in 2010, when the uninsured rate for non-elderly adults was 18.2%. It\u2019s now 10.3%. Here\u2019s what\u2019s at risk: Obamacare has meant lower premiums, deductibles and cost-sharing for the roughly 60 million senior citizens and disabled Americans enrolled in the program. The health reform law made many changes to Medicare. It slowed the growth of payment rates to hospitals and other providers, reduced payments to Medicare Advantage plans and improved benefits for enrollees. The Obama administration estimated that the typical Medicare beneficiary pays about $700 less in premiums and cost sharing thanks to the Affordable Care Act. Trump leans into midterms with a pitch to un-rig Medicare drug prices Under Obamacare, Medicare enrollees also receive free preventative benefits, such as screenings for breast and colorectal cancer, heart disease and diabetes. And Obamacare helped close the gap in Medicare\u2019s drug coverage and was on track to completely eliminate it by 2020. Senior citizens have to pay more for drugs while they are in the donut hole, which lies between the initial coverage and catastrophic coverage phases. (The Bipartisan Budget Act of 2018 accelerated the closing of the coverage gap to 2019.) But Obamacare does mean higher costs for more affluent beneficiaries. The law froze the threshold for the Medicare premium surcharge at $85,000 for individuals and $170,000 for couples, so more people have become subject to it. The Affordable Care Act also added a premium surcharge on drug coverage for higher-income enrollees. Obamacare requires that companies with at least 50 employees provide affordable insurance to their staffers who work more than 30 hours a week. This mandate didn\u2019t have a major impact on the 150 million workers who are insured through their jobs. Most larger employers already offer coverage for full-time workers. However, setting the bar at 30 hours a week prompted some employers to extend coverage to more of their staff, since many companies had considered that threshold to be part-time. Also, the law allows children to remain on their parents\u2019 plans until they turn 26. This has proven to be one of the more popular Obamacare provisions and has helped lower the uninsured rate of this age group. Workers also no longer have to pay for contraceptives and preventative screenings, such as colonoscopies and mammograms. Obamacare requires these be provided free of charge. The ACA also prohibits employers from imposing annual or lifetime limits on benefits and caps out-of-pocket spending. Obamacare also had an impact on employees who work at companies with fewer than 50 workers. Insurers can no longer ban workers with pre-existing conditions or ask them to pay more. The law requires plans to cover an array of benefits, including maternity, mental health and prescription drugs. And it limits insurers from charging older workers premiums more than three times those of younger workers. However, this more comprehensive coverage has come at a price. Obamacare\u2019s regulations caused premiums to spike, forcing some small businesses to stop offering health insurance to their workers. Obamacare has had the largest impact on the individual market, which was largely unregulated prior to the health reform law. The real reason Trump is talking about pre-existing conditions The Affordable Care Act requires insurers to cover people with pre-existing conditions and banned them from charging the sick more. The law ended the practice of insurers imposing annual or lifetime caps on benefits, and it also placed limits on annual out-of-pocket spending. It mandates that insurers provide more comprehensive benefits, including medication, maternity and mental health. It prevents insurers from charging women more and restricts premiums for older folks to no more than three times those of young adults. Obamacare set up health insurance exchanges to allow Americans to shop for individual policies and created federal subsidies so low- and moderate-income enrollees could buy policies for less than 10% of their income. It also limits the deductibles and co-payments for lower-income policyholders. Obama pushes Obamacare enrollment as deadline looms Nearly 11.8 million people signed up for coverage on the Obamacare exchanges for 2018. About 2.5 million Americans purchased individual policies outside of the Obamacare exchanges. They cannot apply for subsidies, but receive all of the other benefits. Many consumers, however, have not been happy with the changes Obamacare wrought \u2013 particularly because they caused premiums to spike. Many middle class Americans who don\u2019t qualify for subsidies have dropped their coverage, saying it\u2019s now unaffordable. Some Americans ditch Obamacare for cheaper alternatives The Trump administration has sought to undermine the law by providing alternative coverage \u2013 such as short-term health policies \u2013 that don\u2019t have to adhere to all of Obamacare\u2019s provisions, particularly those protecting people with pre-existing conditions. It is also allowing states to apply for changes to their Obamacare programs. The main beneficiaries of these efforts are younger and healthier Americans, who will be able to buy less comprehensive policies with lower premiums. Before Obamacare, most Medicaid enrollees were low-income children, pregnant women, parents, the disabled and the elderly. The health reform law opened up the program to low-income adults with incomes of up to 138% of the poverty threshold \u2013 $16,700 for a single person \u2013 in states that opted to expand their Medicaid programs. So far, 36 states and the District of Columbia have expanded Medicaid or passed ballot measures to do so. Nearly 12 million Americans gained coverage under this provision as of 2016, the most recent figures available. Medicaid is expanding in 3 red states Under the program, the federal government paid 100% of the costs of the expansion population for the first three years and is slowly lowering the reimbursement rate to 90%.",

            "article_content": "Officially, Joe Biden remains undecided about whether he will run for president for a third time in 2020. But unofficially, the former vice president sounds like he is running \u2013 no, sprinting \u2013 toward the presidential starting line. \u201cI\u2019ll be as straight with you as I can. I think I\u2019m the most qualified person in the country to be president,\u201d Biden said at an appearance Monday at the University of Montana. \u201cThe issues that we face as a country today are the issues that have been in my wheelhouse, that I\u2019ve worked on my whole life.\u201d That is not something you say right before you decide not to make a run for national office. Biden said Monday that he is still six weeks to two months away from making a final decision, but like, come on man. We know the deal! Remember that Biden quite clearly wanted to run in 2016 but eventually concluded that the timing wasn\u2019t right, with the race coming so soon after the death of his eldest son, Beau, from brain cancer. But as CNN\u2019s Stephen Collinson noted at the time: \u201cIn tone, the remarks sounded like the kind of speech defending staunch Democratic values that he might have given had he reached the opposite conclusion.\u201d What was clear then \u2013 and is even more clear now \u2013 is that the bug of running for president has not left Biden. His 1988 bid, in which he was considered a top tier contender, ended amid plagiarism questions. His 2008 campaign never really got off the ground \u2013 eclipsed by brighter lights like Hillary Clinton, Barack Obama and, yes, John Edwards. Biden would enter this race in a far different \u2013 and better \u2013 position than in either of his previous two bids. According to most early state and national polling, he is the race\u2019s front-runner \u2013 albeit by dint of the fact he is the best-known candidate in the field. Still, that\u2019s a place Biden has never been before. And for someone who has spent his entire adult life aspiring to be president, that\u2019s a very hard prospect to pass up. Which is why, almost certainly, Biden won\u2019t pass it up. The bigger question I have is not whether Biden will run but whether the pitch he is planning to make to Democratic voters is the right one for this moment, against this President. Is being the \u201cmost qualified person\u201d the way to sell yourself to Democratic voters desperately in search of someone who can beat Donald Trump? THE POINT -- NOW ON YOUTUBE! \nIn each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe! Here\u2019s Biden, again on Monday, expanding on that \u201cmost qualified\u201d idea: \u201cNo one should run for the job unless they believe that they would be qualified doing the job. I\u2019ve been doing this my whole adult life, and the issues that are the most consequential relating to the plight of the middle class and our foreign policy are things that I have \u2013 even my critics would acknowledge, I may not be right but I know a great deal about it.\u201d Which, on its face, is hard to argue. Biden was elected to the Senate at 29 years old. He\u2019s chaired the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the Senate Judiciary Committee. He spent eight years as vice president. It\u2019s a long and impressive resume of work within the government. But that last sentence also contains the two biggest potential problems for Biden when \u2013 oops, if \u2013 he runs in 2020: 1) He\u2019s not young and 2) His entire life has been spent in government. Biden is 76 years old. He will turn 78 just a few weeks after the 2020 election. If he won, he would be, by far, the oldest person ever elected to a first term as president. (Trump currently holds that distinction \u2013 at age 70.) And it\u2019s not just that Biden is on the older side. It\u2019s that the Democratic Party over the past few elections has shown how the face of its base is changing \u2013 it\u2019s younger, less white, less male and more liberal. Biden is the opposite of all of those things. Biden has ever really had one job in his life: Politician. The last two presidents \u2013 Trump and Obama \u2013 cast their lack of substantial political experience as a strength among voters who, well, hate Washington and everyone in it. There\u2019s an argument to be made that Trump\u2019s rocky \u2013 to be kind \u2013 time in office has convinced a majority of Americans that what is required in 2020 is someone who has been there and done that. But the fight between political innocence and political experience is one that still has to be fought out within the Democratic Party. One thing I will give Biden: He\u2019s not only aware of his weakness (a huge advantage for any politician or, really, any human) but he is able to use humor to frame his flaws in the best possible light. Take this answer from Biden when asked on Monday night about his reputation as a \u201cgaffe machine\u201d: \u201cI am a gaffe machine, but, my God, what a wonderful thing compared to a guy who can\u2019t tell the truth. I\u2019m ready to litigate all those things. The question is, what kind of nation are we becoming? What are we going to do? Who are we?\u201d Does that sound like a candidate who isn\u2019t sure about running for president?",

            "article_content": "Former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg is giving Democratic midterm candidates a last-minute boost, adding another $10 million to his $100 million effort to help Democrats wrest control of Congress away from Republicans. The majority of the new cash will fund an ad buy though Independence USA PAC, Bloomberg\u2019s super PAC. The ad will begin airing on television and online in eight cities \u2013 Chicago, Seattle, Detroit, Kansas City, Miami, Orlando, Portland and Atlanta \u2013 on Friday. The ad will also air on national cable outlets, including MSNBC and CNN. The ad buy from Bloomberg, reported first by CNN, comes during what has become an active midterm cycle for a politician who is openly flirting with a 2020 run. The ad slams Republicans for failing to deliver policies that benefit the middle class and suggests that the Democrats are more committed to cutting taxes for the middle class and ensuring health coverage for people with pre-existing conditions. \u201cIn Washington, one party is calling the shots and the middle class isn\u2019t being heard,\u201d a narrator in the ad. \u201cIt\u2019s clearer than ever that we need a new Congress,\u201d Bloomberg said in a statement to CNN. \u201cWith the midterm elections less than two weeks away, we\u2019re taking this message from coast to coast and urging voters to elect Democrats to the House and the Senate.\u201d Bloomberg to donate $20 million to bolster Democrats in Senate fight Bloomberg, who served three terms as mayor, has been crisscrossing the country to speak at events and fundraisers in support of Democratic candidates. During the stops, Bloomberg frequently criticizes Trump\u2019s policies and chides Republicans for failing to serve as a check on Trump, stoking further speculation Bloomberg will run for president \u2014 an idea he\u2019s flirted with during the lead-up to previous election years. Democrats in Washington took Bloomberg\u2019s presidential ruminations more seriously, however, after he pledged in June to spend $80 million on behalf of Democrats in the 2018 midterms. He later upped the number to $100 million, a massive amount that has amplified Republican concerns in Washington that Democrats will be able to bury them in ads for the final weeks of the campaign. Bloomberg is already spending on key contested races in expensive media markets. On Thursday, for example, Independence USA will spend $4.5 million for Katie Hill and $4.1 million for Harley Rouda, according to the Federal Election Commission, two California congressional candidates looking to unseat Republicans in the expensive Los Angeles media market. While Bloomberg\u2019s giving will give him credibility with Democrats, should he decide to run in 2020 he will have marked hurdles to overcome, too \u2013 namely the fact that Wall Street, something synonymous with the centrist former mayor, has become a bogeyman in left-leaning Democratic politics. Before running for mayor of New York, Bloomberg was a Democrat. He switched parties, registering as a Republican in 2000 to get on the ballot. The Democrats were backing another candidate. Bloomberg switched parties again and registered as an independent in the summer of 2007. Earlier this month, he re-registered as a Democrat. \u201cEven as I support Democrats this fall, I will always believe no party has a monopoly on good ideas. Both sides can learn from each other if we are willing to listen to one another,\u201d Bloomberg said at CNN\u2019s CITIZEN conference earlier this week.",

            "article_content": "President Donald Trump has always had a very casual relationship with the truth. From his roots as a self-promoting businessman in New York City to his late-in-life political career, he\u2019s showed a penchant for prevarication, to purposely misleading for his business or political benefit. \u201cOK, well we both know that he\u2019s telling lies,\u201d said Anthony Scaramucci, a longtime Trump confidante, about the President during an interview with CNN\u2019s \u201cNew Day\u201d Wednesday. \u201cSo if you want me to say he\u2019s a liar, I\u2019m happy to say he\u2019s a liar.\u201d It\u2019s hard to dispute that. The Washington Post Fact-Checker blog has counted more than 5,000 false or misleading claims made by Trump in just his first 601 days in office. That\u2019s an average of more than eight false or misleading claims a day. Every day since January 20, 2017. (Sidebar: There has been \u2013 and continues to be \u2013 an active debate as to whether Trump\u2019s misstatements and falsehoods should be referred to as \u201clies.\u201d I am of the mind that a \u201clie\u201d means willful misrepresentation; or specifically, that Trump knows the truth and purposely is not telling it. Because the President repeats SO many of his false claims, even in the face of questions from reporters, or after presented with the facts, it\u2019s very difficult for me to believe he is entirely unaware that what he is saying is false or misleading. \u201cLie\u201d therefore strikes me as the most accurate term for what Trump is doing.) What\u2019s remarkable about Trump\u2019s pace of falsehoods is that it is picking up \u2013 both in quantity and quality \u2013 as the 2018 midterm elections approach. (Just 13 days away now!) That is, as he\u2019s gone on a media blitz and appeared at a spate of rallies to make his case ahead of the election, Trump is telling more \u2013 and bigger \u2013 falsehoods, with more apparent frequency, than his previous average of eight a day. Consider what Trump has said in just the last few days: 1.  He alleged, repeatedly, that \u201ccriminals and unknown Middle Easterners are mixed in\u201d to the caravan currently making its way across southern Mexico. His proof? He has none, which Trump himself acknowledged on Tuesday night. \u201cThere could very well be,\u201d Trump said of his claims about the caravan.  \u201cThere\u2019s no proof of anything. There\u2019s no proof of anything, but they could very well be.\u201d So, yeah. 2. He said that a middle-class tax cut was coming soon. On Monday at a campaign rally for Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, Trump said this: \u201cWe\u2019re going to be putting in a 10% tax cut for middle-income families. It\u2019s going to be put in next week.\u201d But, it\u2019s not \u2013 as even Larry Kudlow, Trump\u2019s top economic policy adviser, admitted. \u201cIt may not surface for a while, but that\u2019s his goal,\u201d Kudlow said of the Trump tax cut. \u201cThat\u2019s his policy intent. And I don\u2019t see anything wrong with that.\u201d Aside from Trump\u2019s claims being false, I guess. 3. He claimed Californians were rioting in protest of their state\u2019s sanctuary cities. \u201cBy the way, a lot of people in California don\u2019t want them, either,\u201d Trump said over the weekend at a rally in Nevada. \u201cThey\u2019re rioting now. They want to get out of their sanctuary cities.\u201d Pressed on that claim by reporters this week. Trump responded: \u201cYou shouldn\u2019t have \u2013 take a look. They want to get out of sanctuary cities. Many places in California want to get out of sanctuary cities.\u201d Again, he offered zero proof of that claim. Because, well, there is none. 4. He warned of widespread voter fraud. In a tweet over the weekend, Trump wrote this: \u201cAll levels of government and Law Enforcement are watching carefully for VOTER FRAUD, including during EARLY VOTING. Cheat at your own peril. Violators will be subject to maximum penalties, both civil and criminal!\u201d The problem? Study after study \u2013 including one commissioned by George W. Bush\u2019s administration in the mid 2000s \u2013 has revealed zero evidence of widespread, purposeful voter fraud. So, in the last five days, the President of the United States had lied about \u2013 among other things \u2013 the caravan, tax cuts, sanctuary cities and voter fraud. That\u2019s in addition to the usual panoply of falsehoods included in his stump speech, such as: a) The idea that Democrats want to confiscate guns from law-abiding citizens b) That liberal billionaire George Soros is paying for protests against Supreme Court Justice Brett Kavanaugh c) that Kavanaugh was found innocent of sexual assault d) that Democrats are the \u201cparty of crime\u201d e) that Kavanaugh was ranked number one in his class at Yale f) that Trump\u2019s campaign did very well with women in the 2016 election \u2013 and on and on and on. It\u2019s an absolute cavalcade of falsehoods. So many that even keeping track of all of them is more than a full-time job. (Toronto Star DC bureau chief Daniel Dale does the best job of anyone staying on top of all of Trump\u2019s untruths.) That Trump is picking up his already active pace when it comes to lying this close to the election speaks to the political power that his willingness to not tell the truth has \u2013 particularly with his supporters. Trump has actively urged his allies not to listen to anyone but him \u2013 up to and including themselves. \u201cStick with us,\u201d Trump said over the summer. \u201cDon\u2019t believe the crap you see from these people, the fake news. \u2026 What you\u2019re seeing and what you\u2019re reading is not what\u2019s happening.\u201d What he has created by those sorts of statements is a bloc of voters who believe he is the only person in the country telling them the truth, even when it is demonstrably clear \u2013 based on established facts \u2013 that he is not. Because Trump knows he is the single news source for many people, he peddles a narrative that he knows will anger and enliven them heading into an election where Democrats have held the enthusiasm advantage for months: That the country is under attack from political correctness, illegal immigrants, the \u201cResistance\u201d and the \u201cdeep state.\u201d That he alone can prevent this dangerous brew from exploding. That he alone can fight for them against the forces aligned against them. That all of this narrative is built on an increasingly broad and deep base of lies is of no consequence to either Trump or his supporters. But it should be.",

            "article_content": "Democratic Sen. Elizabeth Warren used to briskly walk through the Capitol and ignore reporters \u2013 often with an aide by her side shielding her from questions. She used to resist engaging on issues and controversies beyond ones that launched her political career \u2013 like railing against income inequality and big banks. And she used to have few answers about her Native American ties despite questions that have lingered since her 2012 Senate campaign. Those days are over. As she prepares for a potential 2020 run, Warren has taken a series of steps shifting her political and public relations efforts \u2013 culminating in the Monday release of a carefully produced, campaign-style video showcasing her family roots and releasing a DNA test that shows she had at least a fraction of Native American blood dating back generations. Warren aides said Monday that the release of the video \u2013 along with a new website pushing back against President Donald Trump\u2019s attacks against her \u2013  is not an isolated move. In addition to putting to rest questions about her ethnicity, aides said, she wants the public to learn more about her career, family roots and personal life. And in recent weeks she\u2019s released 10 years of tax returns, disclosed personnel files from her time as a law professor at Harvard and other schools, and cooperated with a Boston Globe investigation that concluded her Native American ties were not a factor during a rise in her career. The goal, aides said, was to show she has nothing to hide \u2013 but also to broaden her appeal beyond a fiercely liberal, anti-Wall Street image that has dominated much of her career. \u201cI used my mama\u2019s grit to get through commuter college and law school,\u201d Warren said in the Monday video, showing her meeting with her siblings in a middle-class home in Oklahoma. \u201cI used my daddy\u2019s relentless optimism when I was balancing babies and books. But my background played no role in my hiring.\u201d The Massachusetts Democrat\u2019s decision to release the findings may not remove all suspicions about her heritage and whether she used it to advance her career \u2013 especially since her chief antagonist, Trump, has used the issue like a blunt object against her and ridiculed her Monday for having a tiny fraction of Native American blood, which a genealogist said dates back anywhere from six to 10 generations in her family. \u201cShe owes the country an apology,\u201d Trump chided her Monday as he toured hurricane damage in Warner Robins, Georgia. \u201cWhat is the percentage? 1/1000.\u201d Still, the results do give the senator some scientific proof to point to in an attempt to take the issue off the table in a Democratic primary. In large part, Democratic strategists say, the move could also help defuse questions about her electability among Democratic voters worried that Trump could launch ferocious attacks \u2013 denigrating her as \u201cPocahontas\u201d \u2013 that could derail a general election campaign. Some Democrats questioned the timing, three weeks before the November 6 midterm elections, when most of the political world is focused on what will happen to the balance of power in Congress. A Warren aide said the timing was dictated in part because the test results came back Friday. But others thought the timing made sense, quickly addressing the heritage question before the presidential election starts in earnest soon after the November midterms. David Axelrod, a former political adviser to President Barack Obama who is now a CNN contributor, said in a tweet that the \u201cextraordinary\u201d video is proof Warren will run for president and is concerned the Native American issue could hurt if not put to rest. \u201cIt says: 1)@SenWarren is 100% running. 2)She thinks the Pocahontas crap is a potential problem. 3)She wants to dispose of it now, lest she be Birtherized. The risk I\u2019m sure she considered? This elevates it.\u201d Not fully settled by the release is to what extent her Native American heritage may have helped her land key teaching posts at University of Pennsylvania and Harvard \u2013 something Republicans continued to argue Monday. But that question appears to have been resolved by an investigative Boston Globe story last month that showed her heritage didn\u2019t impact her getting hired or advancing in her career. \u201cMy family is my family, but the Boston Globe conducted an enormously thorough investigation and determined that my family\u2019s background had nothing to do with my being hired anywhere ever,\u201d Warren told CNN. She also said she didn\u2019t deal with the issue when it was first raised in 2012 because she didn\u2019t have the \u201cbasic information\u201d about her bloodlines, though it lingered for years. \u201cI was a first-time candidate back in 2012 and, frankly, just didn\u2019t have this basic information,\u201d she said. Warren made the comments to CNN last month just before she answered a wide range of reporter questions on other issues of the day \u2013 like reports of Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein discussing wearing a wire in conversations with Trump \u2013 a notable shift.

            "article_content": "When Joe Biden addressed the national dinner for the Human Rights Campaign on Saturday night, he found himself at a familiar juncture. Speaking at the same dinner three years ago, he was grappling with a decision to make a late entrance in the 2016 presidential race mere months after the passing of his son Beau. The circumstances are different this time around (it\u2019s earlier in the process), but he is still mulling whether a third run for the White House could be the charm as he starts a campaign blitz for Democrats ahead of the midterm elections. Biden, who ran failed bids in 1988 and 2008, has publicly said he\u2019ll decide about 2020 by January, a time frame that sources close to the former vice president say mirrors his private discussions. But as he travels across the country, including to key presidential battleground states, his longtime network of loyal donors and operatives are watching and waiting for signs that he is inching toward a presidential run. \u201cHe certainly feels the push from people who want him to run, so of course it\u2019s there,\u201d one Biden adviser said. \u201cBut in terms of the nuts and bolts of planning his time and thinking of what he\u2019s doing, he\u2019s focused on how he can be of most help to the Democratic Party.\u201d Biden took direct aim at President Donald Trump on Saturday night, noting that \u201cforces of intolerance remain determined to undermine and roll back the progress you have made.\u201d \u201cInstead of using the full might of the executive branch to secure justice, dignity, and safety for all, the President uses the White House as a literal, literal bully pulpit, callously exerting his power over those who have little or none,\u201d he said. He kicked off his midterm campaign sprint by literally running through a Labor Day parade in Pittsburgh alongside union workers \u2013 a group at the heart of his blue-collar, middle-class message. \u201cI\u2019ve been with these guys my whole life,\u201d Biden said. \u201cThese are the guys that brung me to the dance, as the saying goes.\u201d In the first week of October, Biden will make a three-day swing to California and Nevada to raise money and hold public events, including a likely stop with Democratic Senate candidate Jacky Rosen in Nevada, a source with knowledge of the plans tells CNN. Democrats see a real pickup opportunity in Rosen\u2019s race against incumbent GOP Sen. Dean Heller. It\u2019s all part of Biden\u2019s push to be one of the most active Democratic surrogates on the trail this fall with the pace of his campaigning picking up in October. His team says he\u2019s squarely focused on getting Democrats elected in 2018 \u2014 but nearly everywhere he goes questions about 2020 loom. Joe Biden's running. Literally Headlining the dinner for the country\u2019s largest lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender and queer civil rights group on Saturday gave Biden, the first vice president to back same-sex marriage, a chance to stay connected to a key portion of the Democratic base. As the former vice president started his speech, a few people in the crowd yelled \u201cRun Joe!\u201d He responded, \u201cThank you.\u201d Biden has said that after the midterms he\u2019ll engage in an \u201caltar call\u201d to gauge whether the support exists for a run, and the final verdict about whether he\u2019ll launch a bid will boil down to a family decision. Biden\u2019s brain trust includes longtime strategist Mike Donilon; former chief of staff and the managing director of the Penn Biden Center Steve Ricchetti; former Sen. Ted Kaufman of Delaware; executive director of the American Possibilities PAC Greg Schultz; and former communications director Kate Bedingfield. His sister, Valerie Biden Owens, who managed each of his campaigns, remains a trusted confidante. Should he decide to launch a 2020 bid, Biden could tap into a network of supporters, donors and aides that spans decades. \u201cAs far as any candidate that I think has shown an interest, Joe would be by and far the one person that I would get out and support wholeheartedly,\u201d said Bruce Hunter, an Iowa state representative who\u2019s a longtime supporter of Biden\u2019s. \u201cWe are asking and he\u2019s saying, \u2018I\u2019m not even going to contemplate that till after the midterms,\u2019 \u201d said George Tsunis, an Obama bundler who wanted Biden to run in 2016. \u201cI would be very excited for the country if he were to do that. I think he\u2019s very, very capable.\u201d For most of the last year, Biden\u2019s campaign work primarily focused on doling out endorsements and raising money for Democratic candidates, particularly incumbent senators in states that Trump won in 2016. Later this month, he\u2019ll appear at a fundraiser for the Democratic National Committee in Boston. But his attention in these final weeks before the election will shift to classic Joe Biden retail politicking as his team crafts a robust but flexible schedule to appear with candidates. \u201cI\u2019m updating my travel in real-time to make sure I\u2019m as effective a voice as I can possibly be for the incredible set of diverse, strong leaders we\u2019ve endorsed,\u201d Biden wrote in a fundraising email from his political action committee American Possibilities. To date, Biden has publicly endorsed more than 75 Democratic candidates for Senate, House, governor and other state-level races. Those earning endorsements range from Obama administration alumni \u2013 like Andy Kim in New Jersey\u2019s 3rd Congressional District; Gina Ortiz Jones in Texas\u2019 23rd Congressional District; and Elissa Slotkin in Michigan\u2019s 8th Congressional District \u2013 to longtime friends like New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, whom Biden praised in a TV ad that blanketed the New York media market ahead of this week\u2019s primary. Biden\u2019s advisers say they are mapping out plans for the former vice president to hit industrial states in the Midwest as well as Florida to help in Senate and governors\u2019 races. He\u2019ll also be a frequent fixture in Pennsylvania and New Jersey \u2013 where a handful of close races could help Democrats win control of the House. \u201cI think that Vice President Biden resonates deeply throughout the country,\u201d said Valerie Jarrett, who was a top adviser to former President Barack Obama. She added that the Democratic Party is \u201cfortunate to have someone as compelling and popular as Vice President Joe Biden traveling as actively as he is in the midterms.\u201d But there are two high-profile states Biden won\u2019t set foot in before Nov. 6 \u2013 Iowa, where he endorsed state Rep. Abby Finkenauer in the state\u2019s 1st Congressional District, and New Hampshire. His team says any visits to the early presidential caucus and primary states run the risk of shifting attention from the candidates to his presidential ambitions. Biden launches LGBTQ family acceptance campaign A visit to South Carolina, the third nominating contest, is under consideration, but his team argues that\u2019s different due to Biden\u2019s long-term connections to the state \u2013 where he has endorsed Democratic gubernatorial nominee James Smith, who is a close friend of the Biden family, including the late Beau Biden. \u201cJoe Biden\u2019s been coming to South Carolina since the 1980s,\u201d said Dick Harpootlian, a longtime Biden supporter who earned the former vice president\u2019s endorsement in his state Senate race this year. \u201cHe\u2019s participated in Democratic primary politics here. When he was vice president, he helped us raise money. He\u2019s almost a local.\u201d A stop in Georgia, where he endorsed Stacey Abrams, a progressive African-American candidate for governor, is also a potential option. Aside from the avoiding-Iowa-and-New-Hampshire strategy, Biden\u2019s team is adamant that 2020 will not play a factor as they plan out his trips. But he is notably eyeing visits to help candidates in Florida, Ohio, Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin \u2013 all competitive races but also five of the six states Trump flipped from blue to red in 2016 that Democrats are eager to win back. The one Democratic surrogate who could eclipse Biden for attention during the midterms is Obama, who stepped into the political fray last week as he criticized Trump by name for the first time. Biden and Obama have maintained a close relationship since leaving office. They speak from time to time, but the contact is not as frequent as their daily check-ins and weekly lunches at the White House, of which Biden so often boasted. In July, they got the gang back together for lunch at a Georgetown bakery that helps veterans and military families. When Biden debuted his Instagram account, which quickly racked up over a million followers, the former president welcomed him by posting a selfie of the two, writing, \u201cyou\u2019ll always be one of the rare exceptions to my no-selfies rule.\u201d A post shared by Barack Obama (@barackobama) Obama has made few appearances with other candidates mulling 2020 bids. But he has held meetings with several Democrats considering runs to dole out advice about running in the Trump era and how to best set up the party for the future. He has typically refrained from endorsing in primary races, so it\u2019s unclear if he will wade into the presidential primaries in 2020 to endorse his close friend Biden or any other candidates he\u2019s impressed by. One Democrat close to the former president said there have been no discussions of endorsements at this point. Before any potential Biden-Trump campaign face-off, Biden would need to tackle a crowded Democratic primary field \u2013 where dozens of names have been floated as possible contenders. The former vice president could find himself competing against progressives like Sens. Bernie Sanders of Vermont and Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts at a time when much of the energy in the Democratic Party comes from the left. Biden, who would be 77 as the nominating contests get underway, may also be stacked up against a crop of younger, fresh-faced Democrats such as Sens. Cory Booker of New Jersey and Kamala Harris of California. The current President is three years younger than Biden. \u201cI think Vice President Biden is one of those candidates who actually can go to any place in America and be well received, whereas others may be less well received,\u201d said Robert Wolf, a Democratic donor and friend of Obama and Biden. \u201cHe sits in a great seat \u2013 but getting through a Democratic primary I have a feeling will not be easy for anyone.\u201d \u201cA dream.\u201d That\u2019s how Trump recently described a potential run against Biden in 2020. \u201cPresident Obama took him out of the garbage heap, and everybody was shocked that he did. I\u2019d love to have it be Biden,\u201d Trump said in an interview with CBS News. Biden recently launched a sarcastic jab of his own at Trump. \u201cI\u2019m clearly not as smart as Trump, the smartest man in the world,\u201d he said to laughter at a DC speech. \u201cBut I have a relatively high IQ.\u201d The verbal brawl between the two initially escalated earlier this year, when they started talking about physically fighting each other. \u201cA guy who ended up becoming our national leader said, \u2018I can grab a woman anywhere and she likes it,\u2019 \u201d Biden said in March referring to Trump\u2019s \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape. \u201cThey asked me if I\u2019d like to debate this gentleman, and I said no. I said, \u2018If we were in high school, I\u2019d take him behind the gym and beat the hell out of him.\u2019 \u201d Biden\u2019s comments were similar to ones he had made in 2016. Trump bit back on Twitter, writing, \u201cCrazy Joe Biden is trying to act like a tough guy. Actually, he is weak, both mentally and physically, and yet he threatens me, for the second time, with physical assault. He doesn\u2019t know me, but he would go down fast and hard, crying all the way. Don\u2019t threaten people Joe!\u201d Biden later expressed regret for his comments. \u201cI shouldn\u2019t have said what I said. I shouldn\u2019t have brought it up again because I don\u2019t want to get down in the mosh pit with this guy,\u201d he told \u201cPod Save America.\u201d \u201cThe idea that I would actually physically get in a contest with a President of the United States or anybody else now is not what I said, and it is not what this was about, but I should have just left it alone.\u201d According to an Axios report, advisers to the President have said Biden is the Democrat he fears running against the most. A CNN poll of registered voters conducted in January found Biden leading Trump 57% to 40% in a hypothetical match-up. One Biden adviser said they expect his criticism of the President this fall to be more implicit than explicit. Biden has already previewed some of that messaging as he\u2019s talked about respect, dignity and American values, and he\u2019s frequently lambasted the \u201cphony populism\u201d and \u201cnaked nationalism\u201d he thinks the President and the Republican Party promote. \u201cI think he will speak about his values and his core values of the Democratic Party that represents the best interest of all Americans,\u201d Jarrett said. \u201cI think he will also contrast to what\u2019s happening today, similar to what President Obama \u2013 the policies and the rhetoric that we\u2019re hearing today is inconsistent with those values.\u201d",

            "article_content": "MJ Hegar does not hold back. \u201cI\u2019m an ass kicking, motorcycle-riding, Texas Democrat. That\u2019s who I am!\u201d She says that emphatically, unblinkingly and unapologetically to a constituent at a political meet-and-greet in a suburban Austin, Texas, home. And she is talking to someone she needs to win over. \u201cI\u2019m a Republican,\u201d the woman says to Hegar. \u201cI\u2019d like to know, in a county that is predominantly Republican, what makes you different from our current congressman?\u201d That question hits on the central challenge facing Hegar who, in order to defeat incumbent Republican Rep. John Carter in November, will have to win over GOP-leaning voters. Hegar\u2019s response \u2013 \u201cI\u2019m an American. I\u2019m a veteran. I\u2019m fighting for this country.\u201d \u2013 is how she hopes to do it. Hegar served in the US Air Force and is one of many veterans running as Democrats in the 2018 midterms. She\u2019s part of a broader strategy Democrats have used \u2013 recruit decorated veterans with compelling biographies to reach disillusioned moderates. And these days, in this year of record numbers of female candidates running for Congress, many of them are battle-tested women. \u201cWe worked tirelessly to recruit a historic number of candidates with records of service, including female veterans,\u201d says Molly Mitchell, the Director of Media Affairs for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, the campaign arm of Democrats in the House of Representatives. \u201cThese candidates have powerful personal stories and strong independent profiles that excite the grassroots base and prevent Republicans from successfully putting our candidates into ideological boxes. The DCCC knew that voters would flock to the stabilizing influences of veteran candidates.\u201d That deliberate recruitment is reflected in the current party affiliation of veteran candidates still in the running for national office. And it\u2019s also a shift in what those veteran candidates look like. Current numbers in Congress show 65% of lawmakers who are veterans are Republicans, the vast majority of them male, says Rye Barcott, CEO and co-founder of With Honor, a super PAC formed to elect more veterans to office, regardless of party affiliation. Congressional candidates still in the running are now equal in party division, says Barcott, reflecting a surge in Democratic veterans, especially among women with compelling stories. \u201cThe candidates who are advancing and who we find are most successful this year, the quality they share is that they\u2019re authentic,\u201d Barcott says. \u201cThey haven\u2019t been overly coached by the DC political establishment because they\u2019re outside of it. There\u2019s a hunger for outsiders by voters. Candidates who are true to themselves, speak truth to power and can serve with civility, courage, integrity.\u201d With Honor says it\u2019s tracking approximately 400 candidates who are veterans, with most of those candidates being first time politicians. The organization has endorsed 30 candidates from both parties for federal office, including MJ Hegar. Hegar faces headwinds trying to flip a strong Republican district. But she became the darling of Democrats when she sprung into the national spotlight with a campaign video titled \u201cDoors.\u201d The more than three-minute video introduces Hegar, a retired major and pilot in the Air National Guard, and reveals her compelling biography \u2013 from three tours of duty piloting a rescue helicopter, how that chopper went down and how, even injured, she shot at the Taliban as she herself was rescued. That day brought her a Purple Heart, the Distinguished Flying Cross with Valor, one of the few women in history to earn it, and many scars that she now hides with tattoos. The video continues to her fight with the Pentagon about women in combat and describes how she says she was shunned by Carter, her congressman. \u201cTo this day, I\u2019ve never met John Carter,\u201d says Hegar, who adds that as a former Republican, she voted for Carter, a 15-year incumbent. Absent to her then, Hegar says today, Carter remains absent to constituents in her district. \u201cThe Republican leadership has gone off the frickin\u2019 rails. And the things that the Republican Party stands for now are not representative of the values of the people in this district who voted Republican. I\u2019m connected to this district, I understand the values of this district, I represent the values of this district, because I am this district.\u201d Todd Olsen, a spokesman for Carter, calls that charge \u201cthe exact opposite of the truth.\u201d Olsen adds, \u201cThe congressman has won election after election because he\u2019s a fighter and takes nothing for granted.\u201d In Hegar, Carter faces a unique challenger. Hegar\u2019s tattooed body, motorcycle riding attitude and sometimes R-rated language is igniting an energy among progressives in Texas-31 \u2013 which includes part of the area surrounding Fort Hood \u2013 for the first time in more than a decade. \u201cThese people listen to her. That military tag carries credibility,\u201d says Tom Mowdy, a veteran and Democrat in the district, who came to meet MJ in person at a Democratic mixer. He beamed as MJ spoke. \u201cIsn\u2019t she great!\u201d One reason there are more women veterans running for Congress now is simply timing: many members of the military who joined post-9/11 are retiring and coming to an age when it\u2019s feasible to run \u2013 their late 30s to mid 40s \u2013 and more of them are women. Mikie Sherrill is right in that \u201ccoming of age\u201d group. Sherrill is the Democrat running in the open seat in New Jersey\u2019s 11th Congressional District. The district has been a safe-Republican seat for generations, but Sherrill is poised to flip the seat for Democrats. She\u2019s in that position because she jumped into the congressional race early, cleared the field with early endorsements and strong fundraising. The mother of four and former federal prosecutor also relies heavily on her Navy combat pilot biography to open the door to moderates in her district, especially as a first time candidate. The graduate of the US Naval Academy spent 10 years on active duty with the Navy, flying a Sea King helicopter through Europe and the Middle East. She was a Russian policy officer and worked on the implementation of US nuclear treaty obligations. Throughout that decade of service, Sherrill never asked which political party her fellow sailor or officer belonged to. \u201cI served with people from all backgrounds. Politics was never an issue when it came time to completing the mission,\u201d Sherrill says. Her military background allows her to walk seamlessly through a Hispanic street festival to a middle class political fundraiser. \u201cA lot of people serving today are members of the Hispanic community,\u201d says Sherrill, on a day she posed for pictures with Colombian dancers and Costa Rican immigrants. \u201cI think they look at myself and a lot of the veterans running who have served before have always put the country first so they expect us to do that in Washington.\u201d Both Sherrill and Hegar are endorsed by Serve America, the Democratic PAC founded by Congressman Seth Moulton. Moulton, who served as a Marine officer in Iraq, has raised nearly $3 million to help elect veterans for Congress, state and local races, who often lack the funds to run for office because they\u2019re busy serving their country. Moulton made waves in his first run for Congress, running against a Democratic incumbent. Then in office, he again bucked the Democratic establishment by calling for a new generation of leadership, saying the party leadership was \u201cout of touch.\u201d That kind of independence from the party is exactly what Washington needs, says Moulton as he points to former Marine pilot Amy McGrath, the Democrat running in Kentucky\u2019s 6th district. \u201cCandidates like Amy are running against the establishment,\u201d says Moulton, whose PAC has endorsed McGrath. \u201cThey\u2019re rebelling, putting country over party and it is resonating. At the end of the day, members of the military set aside differences for the country. That\u2019s what Americans should expect from Congress as well. We represent different districts, but we ought to be able to find common ground.\u201d Moulton believes President Donald Trump, whom he referred to as a five-time draft dodger, continues to propel Democratic veterans running for office. \u201cHe\u2019s the best recruiter we got. Veterans are concerned about the country.\u201d On the other side of the political aisle in Congress, Moulton cites Republican veterans as members he can argue with but also find some shared goals with as Americans. Among them is Wisconsin Rep. Mike Gallagher, who served in the US Marine Corps and deployed to Iraq. Gallagher, a Republican, represents a strong pro-Trump district but has broken sharply with the White House on the firing of ex-FBI Director James Comey and the Russia-related investigations. While he often disagrees with Moulton, Gallagher cites their military background as common ground for why they break from their party leadership. \u201cWe approach these issues not for what\u2019s good from my party and how do I score political points, but what\u2019s good for my country?\u201d says Gallagher. That sentiment is echoed by Republican Rep. Brian Mast from Florida, who served in the US Army for more than 12 years, including as a bomb disposal expert in Afghanistan. The last improvised explosive device Mast found injured him so badly, he lost both his legs. \u201cI wanted to keep serving,\u201d says Mast, currently in his first term. Public office gave him a new purpose, and he wants more brothers \u2013 and sisters \u2013 in arms to join him, whichever party they represent. \u201cWe served with people from every religion, every skin color, the poorest to wealthiest background, and yes, gender. We served with all those men and women under the most difficult conditions. And we men and women get the job done.\u201d This story was reported from Round Rock, Texas, and Morristown, New Jersey.",

American Bridge 21st Century will launch \u201cTrade War Watch\u201d on Thursday, which includes a campaign of digital ads, research and a tailored website to make voters aware of how a tit-for-tat trade conflict with China, the European Union, Mexico and Canada is affecting industries across the United States.

The operatives tasked with leading the campaign believe that the issue will also highlight how GOP leaders have dispensed with long-held Republican views on trade to fall in line with Trump. \u201cRepublican candidates have effectively abandoned the voters they are campaigning to represent \u2013 standing by Trump\u2019s disastrous trade war as farmers, manufacturers and small businesses in their communities are hurt,\u201d Amelia Penniman, spokeswoman for American Bridge, said about the campaign. \u201cTrade War Watch will keep a running tab of the casualties of the trade war to make clear to voters that Republicans are not on their side.\u201d Trump campaigned for president pledging to crack down on unfair trade practices, with China drawing much of his ire. As President, he has attempted to make good on that promise by imposing sizable tariffs on Chinese steel and aluminum and cracking down on China\u2019s intellectual property violations, leading the country to respond by imposing tariffs on 128 products ranging from pork, meat and fruit to steel pipes. The European Union, Canada and Mexico have also responded to the US steel and aluminum tariffs levied on them by promising punitive measures targeting billions of dollars in American products. How soybeans --\u00a0yes, soybeans -- could impact the midterm elections The trade war effectively started earlier this month, when the United States imposed the first round of tariffs and China responded in kind. The political impacts of the tariffs are so far unknown, but China has targeted products \u2013 like soybeans \u2013 that largely come from states relevant in the midterms. Republicans worry that a trade war could wipe away the economic growth under Trump. \u201cIt\u2019s not lost on us,\u201d said a top Republican operative involved in the midterms, \u201cthat the trade agenda could turn into a total debacle that would far outweigh the economic benefits of tax reform.\u201d Sen. Ron Johnson said Wednesday that he has shared some of the trade war concerns with the President. \u201cI urge you and your trade representatives to understand the plight of businesses struggling during this period of extreme uncertainty and do everything in your power to return certainty and stability to global markets,\u201d the Wisconsin Republican said. The launch of Trade War Watch comes with two new digital ads \u2013 one aimed at Missouri US Senate candidate Josh Hawley and another at Rep. Andy Barr of Kentucky \u2013 that accuse Republicans of ignoring voters to stand by Trump. \u201cTrump\u2019s trade war is hurting Missouri,\u201d reads a slate in the ad aimed at Hawley, highlighting stories of how tariffs have hurt farmers and companies in the state that rely on imported steel. \u201cJosh Hawley is choosing the trade war over Missouri families.\u201d The ad aimed at Barr uses a similar frame but hits the Republican for tariffs on bourbon, a product exclusively produced in Kentucky. \u201cThis is a war that everyone loses in,\u201d Ken Lewis, the owner of New Riff Distillery, says in the ad. \u201cIf this continues, this could be the beginning of the end of the bourbon boom.\u201d Kelli Ford, a spokesperson for the Hawley campaign, responded to the ad by attacking Sen. Claire McCaskill, Hawley\u2019s Democratic opponent. \u201cJosh has always said we need to see what kind of deal the President will get, but that he\u2019s right to go after trade cheaters, like China, who have built their middle class on the backs of our own,\u201d Ford said. \u201cClaire McCaskill is too busy answering to donors and flying around in her private plane to listen to the concerns of Missouri workers here on the ground.\u201d CNN has reached out to the Barr campaign for comment. In a memo announcing the effort, Bradley Beychok, the President of American Bridge 21st Century, argues that Trump\u2019s trade policies are \u201calready hurting voters in key midterm states and districts, and Republican candidates are failing to stand up for their local economies.\u201d \u201cNow, with Election Day approaching,\u201d Beychok writes, \u201cRepublicans are again putting partisan politics over the people they seek to represent.\u201d Top Republicans and the White House have looked to dismiss fears about trade by suggesting the short-term pain is needed for long-term gain. \u201cThis is short term and the President hopes to open up a number of different markets,\u201d White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said Wednesday, echoing Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin, who argued earlier this month that the United States is not in a trade war. Agriculture Secretary Sonny Perdue said Tuesday that farmers understand why a crackdown on trade is needed and are willing to take the pain. \u201cIt\u2019s a little bit like weight loss,\u201d Perdue said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be good to get there but it is a little painful in the meantime.\u201d",

            "article_content": "George F. Will is not the guy you\u2019d think would be responsible for delivering the most devastating takedown of Vice President Mike Pence you will ever read. And, yet, the conservative columnist\u2019s piece on Thursday is just that \u2013 laying bare the total transformation of the former Indiana governor from principled conservative warrior to #1 fan of President Donald Trump. Will\u2019s whole column is worth reading but two chunks stand out to me. Here\u2019s the first: \u201cHis is the authentic voice of today\u2019s lickspittle Republican Party, he clarifies this year\u2019s elections: Vote Republican to ratify groveling as governing.\u201d And, the second: \u201cTrump is what he is, a floundering, inarticulate jumble of gnawing insecurities and not-at-all compensating vanities, which is pathetic. Pence is what he has chosen to be, which is horrifying.\u201d I told you it was brutal! Will\u2019s penned destruction of Trump \u2013 as only the always-use-the-$1,000-word-when-the-$1-word-would-do wordsmith can \u2013 will draw most of the attention. But, it\u2019s a point that Will only implies about Pence that I think is the most important. The simple fact is Pence, the day he decided to sign on as Trump\u2019s vice president, threw his lot, totally and completely, in with Trump. And, in so doing, broke with who he had been, politically speaking, up until that moment. Let\u2019s go back in time. Pence came to prominence during his days in the House. He rocketed up through the ranks in Congress thanks to his ability to bridge the gap between social and fiscal conservatives and his telegenic presence on cable TV. He left Congress in 2012 to run for governor \u2013 a move widely seen as laying the groundwork for a national bid. But Pence\u2019s political future grew cloudy as chief executive of his home state \u2013 bogged down by a massive national controversy over his decision to sign a religious freedom bill and then his backtracking on some of the provisions in it viewed as anti-gay. By 2016, Pence was facing a serious battle for a second term. His hopes of being a major player on the national stage had faded considerably. And then Trump named him as VP. From Pence\u2019s perspective, it all made sense. No one thought Trump would win. In the wake of that loss, Pence could effectively portray himself as a party guy, someone who signed on to a troubled ticket in hopes of rescuing it for the good of the party but ultimately couldn\u2019t do it. The Trump loss would fall entirely on Trump and his deep flaws as a candidate. Pence would emerge unscathed and, as importantly, with a massive amount of name ID and credibility with Republican activists and donors looking for a 2020 nominee to take down President Hillary Clinton. Except Trump won. And that changed everything for Pence. The second it was clear Trump was actually going to be president, Pence grasped the fact that he was now wedded to Trump forever. And, rather than run from that characterization or try to create some healthy distance between himself and the wildly unpredictable President, Pence sprinted toward Trump and laid a massive bear hug on him. And he\u2019s never let go. At every bill signing ceremony, Pence is there \u2013 perched just off Trump\u2019s shoulder, smiling and nodding reassuringly. When Trump causes controversy with some impolitic comment, Pence is there to calm the jangled nerves of Republican congressional leaders and give media interviews about what Trump really meant. When Trump holds a Cabinet meeting, Pence is there to lavish praise on the boss man. (\u201cI\u2019m deeply humbled as your vice president to be able to be here,\u201d Pence told Trump at an end-of-the-year cabinet meeting in 2017. \u201cBecause of your leadership and because of the strong support of the leadership of the Congress, you\u2019re delivering on that middle class miracle.\u201d) And, when Trump wants an attack dog, Pence is ready and willing \u2013 sticking the knife in, albeit in the nicest possible way. (\u201cI think it\u2019s time to wrap it up,\u201d Pence told NBC\u2019s Andrea Mitchell Thursday of special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation. \u201cAnd I would very respectfully encourage the special counsel and his team to bring their work to completion.\u201d) Pence is all-out committed to ensuring there is never any space \u2013 perceived or real \u2013 between he and Trump. Trump is his meal-ticket to what he really wants \u2013 which is the job Trump currently has. Whether Trump wins or loses re-election in 2020, Pence\u2019s only path to the Republican nomination is being seen by the Trump base as the natural heir to the President\u2019s political legacy. Which is fine. But, as Will\u2019s column lays bare, it also represents a near-total abandonment of the principles Pence built his political career on. Pence doesn\u2019t dine alone with women not his wife; Trump has been married three times and regularly flaunted his sexual prowess in the New York tabloids. Pence was a committed deficit hawk in Congress; Trump has shown little concern with growing the deficit to facilitate his tax cuts and other policy proposals. Pence is a creature of government, having been in elected office since 2001; President was the first office Trump ever ran for. Trump is all brash New Yorker; Pence is a reserved Midwesterner. Trump disdains the legislative process and institutional Washington; Pence was a member of House leadership. On and on it goes. If you were picking a polar political opposite for Trump \u2013 not just in tone but in policy emphasis as well \u2013 you\u2019d be hard pressed to find someone better than Pence. None of that seems to matter to Pence, whose lingering image over the first 16 months of the Trump presidency is of a clapping, unquestioning supporter of anything and everything Trump does. That, of course, is exactly how Pence wants you to think of him.",

            "article_content": "Democrats are pointing to closer-than-expected results of a House special election Tuesday as the latest evidence that this year\u2019s midterms will cement Arizona\u2019s status as a marquee swing state. In a West Valley district that President Donald Trump won by 21 percentage points, Democrat Hiral Tipirneni came just 5 points shy of upsetting Republican Debbie Lesko on Tuesday. That swing follows a pattern of Democratic gains in statewide and special elections since last year. And if it continues through November, it could mean a sea change in Arizona, where Republicans are defending both retiring Sen. Jeff Flake\u2019s seat and Gov. Doug Ducey this fall. \u201cI was thinking if Hiral could make it a 10-point margin, that would be a victory. To make it 5 \u2013 that is earthshaking,\u201d said state Sen. Steve Farley, a leading Democrat in the governor\u2019s race. \u201cWe are talking about every Republican office going Democrat in the next election if that margin holds up.\u201d Tuesday\u2019s contest, more than a month after Democrat Conor Lamb narrowly won a deep-red House seat in the Pittsburgh area, was an opportunity for Democrats to test whether their momentum had spread across the map, and for the GOP to try to fix some of the problems that have plagued the party in recent contests. The Arizona Democratic Party and Maricopa County Democrats spent two months casting the special election as a test run in a state that also includes several potentially competitive congressional seats. They launched the largest field operation Arizona\u2019s 8th District, west of Phoenix, has seen in years, with 465 volunteers knocking on nearly 60,000 doors, making more than 90,000 calls and sending more than 60,000 text messages. \u201cThis special election showcased Democrats\u2019 enthusiasm and hard work to make every seat and every race competitive,\u201d Arizona Democratic chairwoman Felecia Rotellini said in a statement. \u201cRepublicans have shown in this race that they are worried about their ability to elect candidates up and down the ticket in 2018 and beyond,\u201d she said. Tipirneni\u2019s campaign focused on health care and defending Social Security and Medicare. Meanwhile, protests over education funding dominated the state\u2019s headlines, leading to a teacher walkout Wednesday and giving Democrats an opening to hammer Ducey and other Republicans on a local issue. The landscape could look similar this fall for Rep. Kyrsten Sinema, the Democratic Senate hopeful. She\u2019s awaiting the winner of a three-way August 28 primary between Rep. Martha McSally, the GOP establishment\u2019s preference, and two die-hard conservatives \u2013 former state Sen. Kelli Ward and former Maricopa County sheriff Joe Arpaio. Sinema tweeted that the results \u201cshow that Arizonans are fed up with the chaos in Washington. November is coming.\u201d Republicans saw some reason for optimism in the Arizona results. Most ballots there were cast early, and the GOP hit its early voting targets in part due to a cheap (at just $65,000) but effective digital advertising campaign by the consulting firm Cavalry LLC for the Congressional Leadership Fund super PAC. The digital campaign resulted in more than 5 million impressions aimed at a narrow list of 100,000 Republican voters, meaning each voter saw ads, many of which focused on selling the GOP\u2019s tax cuts, on places like Facebook about 50 times. There was also help from the top. Trump placed a robo-call to Arizona Republicans urging them to vote early. Arizona was an easy place to implement that strategy. The state has a \u201cpermanent\u201d early voting list of people who have signed up to always receive early ballots. But Republicans said a similar approach could work in other states, too. \u201cThere\u2019s no perfect silver bullet to a tough political environment,\u201d said Cavalry\u2019s Michael Duncan, who led the digital effort. \u201cBut Arizona shows that Republicans should invest in early voting and digital and not leave any votes on the table, that\u2019s for sure.\u201d Democrats, meanwhile, were pleased with results in Arizona that they said underscored that the 2018 battleground map is continuing to expand. \u201cThis shows momentum, it shows activity, it shows engagement beyond anything we\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d said Charlie Kelly, the executive director of the House Majority PAC, a Democratic super PAC. \u201cAnd I think it speaks to the sort of challenge facing Republicans and the fact that they really don\u2019t have a plan for this other than to look inward at the agenda they push, which focuses exclusively on hurting middle-class families.\u201d Kelly\u2019s group has already reserved $40 million in television air time across 33 congressional districts this fall, and he said more are being added to its list of potential targets every day.",

            "article_content": "A group opposed to the Republican tax law is going on offense in Arizona amid signs of an intensifying special election fight, attacking a key political victory GOP candidates hope to run on this fall. The Tax March \u2013 a nonprofit that is part of the \u201cNot One Penny\u201d progressive coalition \u2013 is spending $500,000 on ads criticizing the tax law in the Phoenix media market over the next three weeks. IRS rules prevent the group from intervening directly or indirectly in political campaigns on behalf of (or in opposition to) specific candidates. The timing and location of the ad buy, however, mean that ads hitting the GOP tax law will be airing ahead of the special election in Arizona\u2019s 8th Congressional District, set for April 24. Debbie Lesko, a state senator, is the Republican candidate in the special election, running against Democrat Hiral Tiperneni, a physician and cancer research advocate. Lesko is heavily favored to win the seat vacated by Trent Franks, who resigned amid accusations of sexual harassment in December. In the new ad, an accountant named Andrew Scalise discusses his disappointment with the tax law. \u201cI\u2019m a practicing accountant for the last nine years,\u201d Scalise said. \u201cWhen this new tax law was coming out, I was enthusiastic, thought it would be a really good thing. But after reading into it a lot more, I think it\u2019s going to hurt regular people.\u201d The ads will also be airing around tax day, April 17 this year. Tax March Executive Director Nicole Gill said the tax law \u201cis a bad deal for the American people\u201d in a statement announcing the ad campaign. \u201cFrom disproportionately benefiting the wealthy to raising costs for middle-class families, this new tax law is a bad deal for the American people,\u201d Gill said. \u201cThe last thing hardworking Americans need is a tax code that gives billions to the wealthy few by raising taxes on a majority of families.\u201d Though Democrats see the tax law as a potential liability for Republicans, GOP leaders are equally confident it\u2019s their key to winning the midterm cycle. President Donald Trump spoke in West Virginia on Thursday touting the tax law and hitting  Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin, who is seeking re-election this year, for voting against it. Corry Bliss, who heads two major GOP groups \u2013 the nonprofit, issue-oriented American Action Network and the political action committee Congressional Leadership Fund \u2013 spoke to the tax law\u2019s importance during the special election in Pennsylvania last month. \u201cAnswer this question and I will tell you if we keep the House or not,\u201d Bliss said. \u201cIn 10 months, does the middle class think we cut their taxes? Every member of the Republican Party should be spending all of their time selling the tax plan. Everything else is a waste of time and money.\u201d Trump carried Arizona\u2019s 8th Congressional District by 20 points in 2016, and Republicans hold a 17-point edge in voter registration there. But a rash of recent spending by Republicans suggests the race could be more competitive this cycle. Since March, the Republican National Committee, National Republican Congressional Committee and Congressional Leadership Fund \u2013 a super PAC aligned with House GOP leadership \u2013 have spent over $600,000 combined on a mix of advertising, mail and canvassing to boost Lesko. The $500,000 ad buy from the Tax March is the first public commitment of resources on the Democratic side. Thus far, the Democratic National Committee and Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee have declined to put significant money into the race, and did not contribute to Tax March\u2019s ad buy. A DNC official told CNN that the committee provided a grant to the state Democratic Party to help support organizing and digital efforts for the upcoming special election. House Majority PAC, a Democratic super PAC focused on flipping the House of Representatives this fall, has yet to spend on the race either. But Jeb Fain, its communications director, told CNN that while Arizona\u2019s 8th district \u201cis an inherently difficult district for Democrats, the group is \u201ckeeping a close eye on this race \u2013 assessing in real time to determine if and how we can be helpful.\u201d Not One Penny has already released two digital ads hitting the tax law, tied to two Republican candidates, Brian Fitzpatrick in Pennsylvania\u2019s 8th district and Tom MacArthur in New Jersey\u2019s 3rd district. Not One Penny has said it plans to spend up to $5 million this cycle campaigning against the tax law.",

            "article_content": "Democrats have a \u201ccrumbs\u201d problem. More specifically: The GOP-passed tax plan that led companies to announce bonuses that House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi dismissed as \u201ccrumbs\u201d compared with \u201cthe bonus that corporate America received\u201d may be popular enough that it can lessen the danger of Republicans being wiped out by a blue wave in this year\u2019s midterm elections. Trump numbers on the rise with help from strong economy and tax reform Near Cincinnati on Monday, President Donald Trump compared Pelosi\u2019s \u201ccrumbs\u201d comment to Hillary Clinton referring to half of Trump\u2019s supporters as belonging in a \u201cbasket of deplorables\u201d during the 2016 presidential election. \u201cNancy Pelosi again said that\u2019s \u2018crumbs,\u2019 \u201d Trump said. \u201cWell, she\u2019s a rich woman who lives in a big, beautiful house in California, who wants to give all of your money away.\u201d Trump was celebrating what could be a sudden change of political fortune for Republicans who for months have worried that their House majority is in jeopardy in November. A Quinnipiac University poll out Wednesday pegged Trump\u2019s approval rating at 40% \u2013 matching recent CNN and Gallup polls to deliver his best rating in seven months. A slim majority of voters, 51%, say they approve of how Trump is handling the economy \u2013 and they now say that Trump, not former President Barack Obama, is primarily responsible for the economy\u2019s health. The GOP-passed tax bill\u2019s approval rating jumped from 26% at its passage in late December to 39% \u2013 not nearly as high as Republicans would like to see, but a stark improvement over what once looked like a political albatross. Pelosi sets record with 7-hour marathon speech on DACA And Democrats now hold a 9-point edge in a generic congressional ballot \u2013 where voters are asked, simply, whether they prefer a Democratic or Republican representative. Weeks ago, pollsters had pegged the Democrats\u2019 edge in the mid-teens. At the same time, Democrats this week won a Missouri state House special election in a district that Trump had won by 28 points in November 2016. \u201cWe don\u2019t have the majority in the bag \u2013 nor should we have our head in a bag hyperventilating,\u201d said Jesse Ferguson, a Democratic strategist who directed the House Democratic campaign arm\u2019s spending on individual races in 2014. Republican strategists credit the tax plan\u2019s passage with their suddenly rosier prospects in this year\u2019s midterms. CNN Key Races: Strong fundraising shifts several House races in Democrats' favor They expected a brawl with Democrats over the benefits the plan delivered to large corporations. And they knew they\u2019d need to claim credit for changes to some workers\u2019 paychecks, which Republican groups are attempting to do with TV ads in key House districts. But the business community\u2019s response \u2013 with some companies announcing bonuses for their workers and others crediting the tax bill with plans to expand or move money back into the United States \u2013 is the real driver of the shift in public opinion, several strategists said. \u201cI don\u2019t think Democrats anticipated the business response,\u201d one GOP strategist involved in 2018 races said. \u201cThere\u2019s a daily announcement of a company investing more money in their employees, investing in the economy,\u201d the strategist said. \u201cThey weren\u2019t expecting that response.\u201d Many GOP operatives were never convinced they were as far behind as previous polls showed in the generic congressional ballot \u2013 and some urged caution now, even as they acknowledged the party had rebounded. There are plenty of reasons to believe the Republican resurgence could be short-lived: The stock market plunged on Friday and Monday. And Democratic challengers outraised their Republican House incumbents in nearly three dozen districts in 2017\u2019s final quarter. \u201cThere are still some question marks here as to where this thing is going to go,\u201d said Brandon Scholz, a Republican strategist in Wisconsin, which features competitive Senate and governor\u2019s races next fall. He pointed to the GOP\u2019s loss of a state Senate special election there last month in a district Trump had carried by 16 percentage points in 2016. \u201cRepublicans had the right playbook, they had the right candidate, everything was right; they just didn\u2019t see these Republican (voters) staying at home,\u201d he said. Questions around Trump \u2013 including the Russia investigation and the President\u2019s willingness to stick to the message the GOP wants to see him drive \u2013 loom large every day. 5 numbers to prove the GOP is sticking by Trump on Russia \u201cThe fundamentals have not changed that Trump is unpopular, his agenda is not liked and Democrats are fired up to take control of Washington away from him,\u201d Ferguson said. \u201cThe one (thing) that keeps me up at night is the torrential downpour of cash that Republicans are going to get now that they passed the tax bill, and making sure that while Democrats aren\u2019t going to be able to match that, we need to at least meet them on that field of battle and fight back.\u201d The politics around the tax bill also remain far from certain: House Speaker Paul Ryan over the weekend was assailed for a tweet \u2013 since deleted \u2013 that pointed to the extra $1.50 per week a high school secretary was receiving as a result of the tax plan\u2019s passage. \u201cAs the Dow nosedives on his watch, the President\u2019s rambling, deceitful tax scam sales pitch reached an all-time low in Cincinnati,\u201d Pelosi spokesman Drew Hammill said. \u201cWhile Speaker Ryan touts a $1.50 a week tax cut for the middle class, President Trump is desperately seeking to hide the multi-billion dollar corporate windfalls of the GOP tax scam behind meager, one-time bonuses,\u201d Hammill added.",

            "article_content": "It was easy to miss amid a 1,000-point stock market plunge, but President Donald Trump just launched his 2018 midterm election campaign. For once, Trump was doing what presidents normally do Monday, traveling to an electoral bellwether state, Ohio, to drum home themes of an economic renaissance laid out in his State of the Union address last week. But Trump being Trump, there were also bewildering asides, withering off-script take downs of Democrats \u2013 including calling them \u201ctreasonous\u201d for not cheering last week\u2019s speech \u2013 and the braggadocio with his tongue slightly in his cheek that made his 2016 campaign rallies compelling viewing. And thanks to his characteristic habit of acting as a third party analyst of his own presidency, there were also signs that Trump is seriously worried about his prospects in November, and even in 2020. But Trump did deliver on the point of his trip, reeling off a targeted and effective electoral argument, claiming credit for healthy job growth, fattening wages following the passage of tax reform and claiming a rebirth of American manufacturing. \u201cYour paychecks are going up. Your taxes are going way down. And right now for the first time in a long time, and you\u2019ve seen it, factories are coming back,\u201d Trump told his crowd in a suburb of Cincinnati. First lady joins Trump on Ohio trip, visits children's hospital \u201cIt\u2019s amazing what we have done together \u2026 this has been an incredible journey,\u201d the President said, touting other promises kept, including the opening of Alaskan tundra to oil drilling and ending the Obamacare mandate. Trump punctuated his speech by welcoming supporters to the stage for them to give glowing testimony about how the tax cut had changed their lives. The event might not have given a full picture of how the measure\u2019s benefits are disproportionately enjoyed by the wealthy. But as a political message it helped Trump make progress on a crucial assignment \u2013 selling the tax cut as a bonanza to the Middle Class and a winner for businesses that create jobs that will leave the whole country better off. \u201cWhen our workers win, who really wins? Our country wins, because we are all in this together. We\u2019re one team, one people and one family,\u201d Trump said. A Monmouth poll published last week suggested that the President\u2019s sales effort might be beginning to work. Some 44% of those asked approved of the new law, a big jump from the 26% who backed it in December. Trump's shifting views on stock market highs Some of what Trump said was vulnerable to a fact checker. His rosy view of an economy that benefits everyone will draw a Democratic counter-narrative as the opposition party tries to win back the Senate and the House. But it represented a coherent package for Republicans as they try to whip up turnout and fight complacency in the face of a raging liberal base of voters who cannot wait to weigh in against the President. As Trump\u2019s 2016 election win showed, a strong sense of narrative connected to a candidate\u2019s political base is essential, and the President\u2019s appearance on Monday suggested he is some way along in fine-tuning his own story. Democrats, who failed to counter the power of Trump\u2019s outsider message in the industrial Midwest in 2016 have yet to offer such a rounded argument on the big stage. Trump's embarrassing split-screen moment on stocks Given Trump\u2019s low approval ratings that have improved somewhat in recent weeks to the low 40% range, and the history of first-term presidents getting a bloody nose in midterm polls, the economy is the best card the GOP can play. But the 4% plunge in stocks that came at the very moment Trump spoke on Monday, giving him an awkward split screen moment on cable TV, was a reminder of the high risk nature of that strategy if things go wrong. After all, there\u2019s no guarantee the economy will keep roaring. A prolonged stock market correction, or action by the Federal Reserve to raise interest rates to stifle inflation could dampen consumer confidence and have a direct political impact. It\u2019s a long way until November. Trump also signaled that a comment by House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi that bonuses given to some workers by corporations were \u201ccrumbs\u201d compared to the huge windfall their employers have reaped through the tax cut, will be a hook for the entire GOP campaign. Republicans appear to believe they have a rhetorical gem comparable to Hillary Clinton\u2019s notorious reference to Trump supporters as \u201cdeplorables\u201d that animated the 2016 election campaign. \u201cI really think her statement \u2018crumbs\u2019 will be equivalent. I think this is not a good day for Nancy Pelosi, she is our secret weapon,\u201d Trump said. In the electoral context, it doesn\u2019t matter that the remark by Pelosi at a press conference in Washington has been ripped out of context. In the same way as Trump\u2019s bold claims about the economy often exaggerate reality, Pelosi\u2019s remark will serve as a thematic talking point for Trump\u2019s attempts to fire up the voters who helped him win the White House as he battles to safeguard Republican majorities in Congress in November. Even if the economy is still doing well: the many other complications of Trump as president, including the Russia probe, his own unpredictable behavior, and even a possible looming war on the Korean peninsula could emerge as dominant themes and help Democrats. In many ways, 2018 could be the ultimate test of the mantra that in elections \u201cIt\u2019s the economy, stupid,\u201d a theme first voiced by Bill Clinton\u2019s 1992 campaign. While Trump is a strong performer on the stump, and wants to throw himself into campaigning for the GOP majority in the midterms, a few moments in Monday\u2019s appearance showed why some vulnerable Republicans in swing districts might want to keep him at arms\u2019 length. His comment that Pelosi and her Senate counterpart Chuck Schumer were \u201ctreasonous\u201d because they didn\u2019t clap his State of the Union address might have delighted voters who flocked to Trump because of his refusal to bow to political correctness. But they also overshadowed the rest of the speech, could fan doubts among independent voters who worry about his temperament and are sure to give Democrats yet another reason to go out in November to vote against him. And there were signs in Trump\u2019s speech that he has the jitters about how things could turn out in November, as Democrats eye an unexpectedly strong showing in the Senate and have genuine hopes of seizing the House, a scenario that could potentially present Trump with an impeachment drama down the road. He mused on the unfortunate history of first-term presidents and midterm elections, suggesting that voters who saw the gains of a big presidential election win suddenly became complacent only two years later. \u201cThe people are happy, and they don\u2019t get out, and they don\u2019t vote like they should. Maybe they go to a movie in \u201918,\u201d Trump told his supporters. \u201cThey sit back and then they get clobbered, because the other people are desperate, and they get out and they have more energy,\u201d he said, arguing that his \u201ctremendous success\u201d made him even more vulnerable to such a fate. In another stream of consciousness digression, Trump suddenly started pondering his prospects in his own re-election race, wondering what a bad showing in November would portend for his hopes of a second term. WH spokesman cites Uber ride in arguing for end to Russia investigation \u201cI know we are going to do great in \u201920 because by that time \u2013 see what happens is, if you did badly in \u201818, now you\u2019re all angry again, and your going \u2018Why?\u2019 But we want to do great in \u201818 and we\u2019re going to do really well in 20. That\u2019s when we go again and keep this great journey going, OK?\u201d",

            "article_content": "Trump, the former reality star, understands imagery The big test of Trump's welcome will come later Friday, at his speech The populist \u201cAmerica First\u201d protectionist who won the White House by scorching the globalized worldview of liberal elites who party at Davos every winter suddenly finds himself the star of their show \u2013 and he is milking it. When Marine One swooped into Davos past the snowcapped peaks of the Swiss Alps Thursday, Donald Trump \u2013 at 71 \u2013 finally claimed his place among the global elite whose members had long spurned him. Trump lands in Davos, abroad again while Russia looms at home As the champion of the \u201cforgotten man,\u201d some might wonder why he showed up to pal around with the hated global elite. But it\u2019s not difficult to believe Trump may enjoy rubbing it in that he\u2019s the world\u2019s most powerful man. In a grand entrance, Trump strolled through a forest of smartphones held up to capture his arrival at the World Economic Forum. When someone asked the interloper whether the globalists would treat him well, he shot back: \u201cYou tell me.\u201d Later, the leader of the global populist movement held court around a table packed with some of Europe\u2019s most powerful CEOs, as they showered him with gratitude for the corporate tax cut and deregulation policies. Trump, the former reality TV star, understands imagery and the picture that was sent was clear: Here he was, among his own kind, but towering over them all as President of the United States. But the big test of Trump\u2019s welcome will come later Friday, when he delivers a speech expected to explain the implications of his \u201cAmerica First\u201d mantra, in which he will also lay claim to the surging US economy and stock market. It\u2019s then that starstruck fascination with Trump the performer may cede to skepticism and hostility if the President veers into his typical populist nationalist routine, with its cutting critiques of global free trade and multilateral institutions. Still, Davos is not a political bear pit, and he will get a hearing. \u201cThe people he is going to see there have better manners than his. Because of that they will be polite,\u201d said Trump\u2019s biographer Michael D\u2019Antonio. \u201cThey have much to gain from his favor, and there is no reason for them to respond negatively to his face,\u201d D\u2019Antonio said, though he predicted there would be plenty of whispering about Trump behind his back. Outside the US, Trump\u2019s presidency is widely seen as a departure from US norms, the values that underpin Western liberalism, and as a repudiation of America\u2019s support for an open, pluralistic and free trading international system. He faces a difficult assignment in convincing his audiences of business titans, politicians and top officials at international organizations that his nationalist viewpoint is a good fit for the rest of the world. \u201cHe is going for show and not for substance. In terms of global policy, he has nothing to say to the people of Davos,\u201d said Nicholas Dungan, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council who teaches at Sciences Po, a prestigious French research university. \u201cIf he is the \u2018stable genius\u2019 of his own description, he will realize at the World Economic Forum that the rest of the planet is moving quite swiftly to fill the void of US leadership in the global system which the US itself created.\u201d Trump touts 'really great relationship' with UK's May Trump\u2019s visit to the Swiss mountain resort is layered in irony, not least because he fanned resentment against such gatherings to win election. In his final campaign ad, Trump flashed a picture of billionaire financier George Soros, a hate figure for conservatives, at Davos as he decried corrupt \u201cglobal special interests,\u201d which he said had bled America dry. Davos is the kind of international, intellectual, technocratic talking shop that conservatives often used to decry as the natural habitat of the Obama administration. But in fact, President Barack Obama, who had a chilly relationship with businessmen, never went to Davos as President. Trump\u2019s arrival at Davos comes after a lifetime of being patronized by the wealthy, well-connected elites who looked down on the brash, self-promoting businessman who constantly boasted about his wealth. In Manhattan real estate circles he was the upstart from Queens who persisted in the vulgar practice of plastering his name over his buildings and lived in a tabloid glare. In business, Trump was never accepted in the pantheon of corporate titans and Wall Street masters of the universe. In  Washington, for the White House Correspondents dinner, Obama lacerated him as payback for his birther crusade, and the DC in crowd hooted at his humiliation. Even when his credentials are good, Trump has never really been comfortable around the beautiful people. The disconnect was on display at the white-tie Al Smith dinner in New York shortly before the 2016 election, when Trump\u2019s jabs at Hillary Clinton hit clanging, discordant notes. But years as an outsider, rebuffed by the establishment, were to pay off for Trump in the most spectacular manner. His own history of being ostracized by elites fueled a quintessential political message that was a perfect fit for the widespread anger at the nation\u2019s political leaders that had been boiling in urban, grass roots America, and to which he expertly gave voice. Given his preoccupation with nurturing his political base, it\u2019s certain that Trump will have a message for his voters watching back home. I wish everyone at Davos had spent the week before with me in Yemen He might also have a lesson for his elite audience. Two years ago, JPMorgan Chase & Co chief executive Jamie Dimon summed up Davos as the place \u201cbillionaires tell millionaires what the middle class feels.\u201d If that is true, Trump might be ideally positioned, given his appeal to the economically battered workers of the industrial Midwest in 2016. Trump also believes he has a story to tell, not just on behalf of the United States. The President views the almost daily run of record highs on Wall Street as a personal validation. He will implicitly counter arguments already made by French President Emmanuel Macron, German Chancellor Angela Merkel and British Prime Minister Theresa May at Davos that globalization is the only way forward with an argument that his policies could benefit the entire world. \u201cAs America grows, the world grows,\u201d Trump\u2019s top economic adviser Gary Cohn told CNN\u2019s Richard Quest in Davos, while also demanding a \u201clevel playing field\u201d for US goods from foreign economies. It\u2019s also unlikely to escape the President\u2019s notice that his tax reform bill and 14 percentage point cut in the corporate tax rate made many in his audience much richer. But there\u2019s probably another reason why Trump is in Davos \u2013 he can\u2019t resist. A showman who thirsts for the spotlight and is perpetually seeking recognition for his brains, success and wealth, Trump will be at the center of the world on Friday, the place where he most wants to be. \u201cHe craves affirmation and acceptance at every level of society. He does it in every context \u2013 he could be speaking to a convention of laborers or a conference of masters of the universe,\u201d said D\u2019Antonio, author of the book \u201cThe Truth About Trump.\u201d \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter who is in the crowd \u2013 he wants their applause, but at the same time it\u2019s quite possible that on another level he loathes all of the same people,\u201d he said.",

Author of \u201cA Shattered Peace: Versailles 1919 and the Price We Pay Today,\u201d Andelman was formerly a foreign correspondent for The New York Times and CBS News in Asia and Europe. Follow him on Twitter @DavidAndelman. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. Somehow, it all seems to be coming together at once. Over the weekend, a Trumpian-style, right-wing politician surged into a runoff election for presidency of Brazil, only narrowly missing the 50% vote in the first round that would have meant instant victory. In Germany, the neo-fascist Alternative for Germany (AfD) party is poised to claim its first seats in Sunday\u2019s regional elections for the Bavarian parliament, which would mean representation for the party in 15 of the 16 regional German parliaments. In Italy, where unemployment is as high as 29% in some southern provinces, Matteo Salvini\u2019s Five Star Movement is in a ruling coalition with the right-wing League. And Salvini has now joined forces with France\u2019s right-wing leader, Marine Le Pen, vowing to \u201cstorm the Brussels bunker\u201d in next year\u2019s European parliamentary elections. Brazil's far-right Bolsonaro wins first round of presidential election But if they get there, they will find some congenial company awaiting them. Right-wing parties are already in power across vast stretches of eastern and central Europe. In Austria, the far-right Freedom Party (FPO) has joined forces to form a coalition government with conservative Chancellor Sebastian Kurz. In neighboring Hungary, Prime Minister Viktor Orban, the grandfather of the European right, won a third term in office on a platform proclaiming that European was being invaded by Middle East immigrants who must be stopped at any cost. In Poland, efforts by right-wing, anti-immigrant Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki to effectively shred his nation\u2019s judicial system rose to the level of a condemnation by the European Parliament, which referred the matter to Europe\u2019s highest court in Luxembourg. Elsewhere, from Denmark to Slovenia to the Czech Republic, anti-immigrant feelings have swept the right to rapidly growing influence, if not outright rule. None of these leaders, of course, would feel very out of place in Donald Trump\u2019s America. Indeed, many feel deep emotional attachment to the American leader, whom they see as very as a guiding moral force. So, when one of Saudi Arabia\u2019s leading opposition journalists, Jamal Khashoggi, disappeared after entering the Saudi consulate in Instanbul, and was feared dead, it did not escape notice that Mohammed bin Salman, the crown prince of Saudi Arabia, has become a close confidant of Trump\u2019s son-in-law and adviser, Jared Kushner. The great irony here is that Turkey\u2019s own right-wing leader, Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan \u2013 not a man with a great track record on the human rights of journalists himself \u2013 felt compelled to come to Khashoggi\u2019s rescue and demand the Saudis prove he was not murdered. And then there\u2019s Donald Trump himself, who just last week assured a conservative dominance of the American system of justice for a generation or more. The fact is that in all of these newly cloned right-wing nations \u2013 though pointedly not in Saudi Arabia, where the ruling monarchy calls the shots \u2013 leaders have been installed quite democratically at the ballot box. How did we arrive at this conundrum? Was not enough blood spilled in Europe and beyond fighting Nazi oppression during World War II to last several lifetimes? Is there no memory left? Not since the peak of the Axis powers during the Second World War, it seems to me as an historian and journalist, has the global right seen such a resurgence of power and influence. To what can we attribute this? A complex of factors all converging in a perfect storm. The middle class, still growing worldwide, has been the primary engine of economic growth in a host of nations, especially the nations of eastern and central Europe, only recently \u2013 in historical terms \u2013 emerging from communism. Yet, today in many countries, these often freshly enfranchised people find themselves still deprived of the real wealth that the post-communist system seems to have promised. They have only one real remedy \u2013 the ballot box. And there are candidates waiting eagerly there to fulfill their dreams. The middle classes can and do vote. And they have cast their votes for at least two fundamental values that many suddenly see as converging \u2013 change and security. It\u2019s just that both such constants have many costs that few seem to have anticipated \u2013 at least not yet. Change can mean tariff battles that can hamper economic and job growth, while security can mean vastly increased attacks on migrants and protestors across the continent. Often this has also meant direct attacks on a free press from Poland to Saudi Arabia, as vicious and virulent as anything seen since the Nazi era. In Sweden, two researchers have suggested that the alarming rise of a far-right political class may be attributed to the fact that \u201cthe established parties have been deaf to the preferences of their own citizens.\u201d Indeed, such a trend may be quite clear across Europe, as established figures like Germany\u2019s center-right Chancellor Angela Merkel still tries desperately to cling to power without giving up entirely on efforts to help the hordes of migrants that keep knocking at Europe\u2019s doors. Erdogan will live to regret attacking Germany Last year, in France, the deafness of parties from the left-wing Socialists to a host of moderate agglomerations sent a 40-year-old political neophyte, Emmanuel Macron, to the Elys\u00e9es Palace as the nation\u2019s president. And now, while he has managed to achieve any number of reforms, riding on the wave of support for his own self-created political party, La R\u00e9publique en Marche, he is also being faced with the need to reshuffle his entire cabinet this week after losing two key members \u2013 Interior Minister Gerard Collomb, who quit suddenly late one evening last week and the popular ecology minister, Nicolas Hulot, who quit on a live national radio broadcast in August. The big question is how much of a political turn will Macron be prepared to take barely 18 months into his five-year term of office. Much of Europe, particularly the centrist elite, horrified by the Trump phenomenon, as well as the resurgent right-wing, will be watching closely the results of the American midterm elections in four weeks for some clue as to how the winds may blow over the final two years of Trump\u2019s first term. With his extraordinary sway across any number of nations, however, the President would do well to reflect carefully on the kind of world he is playing a central role in creating.",

Even on Monday, he was showing his temperament and unpredictability, sulking over the tributes to John McCain, refusing to say the senator\u2019s name, but then relenting and allowing the White House flag to be flown again at half-staff. But at times there is a method to the turmoil. Trump rambled through his Monday night press appearance, announcing the \u201cincredible\u201d trade deal with Mexico and (at least in his mind) wiping out NAFTA and replacing it with the US-Mexico Trade Agreement. But he and his staff were implementing \u2013 crudely, bluntly, but effectively \u2013 the tactics we have seen them use time and time again: Divide and rule. Trump says he's ditching NAFTA but that's not what's happening By winning over the Mexicans, Trump can rule over the Canadians. By sweeping away other news and wildly exaggerating the NAFTA revisions, he can rule at home by proclaiming tariffs and trade agreements before November\u2019s Congressional elections. But will the administration succeed? Certainly the Canadians were rattled on Monday. They were shaken by Trump\u2019s threat of a 25% auto tariff if Ottawa did not \u201cnegotiate fairly,\u201d i.e., concede to US demands by this Friday. They were concerned by other administration officials repeating the ultimatum, such as chief economic advisor Larry Kudlow\u2019s \u201cif we can\u2019t get a good strong fair deal with Canada\u2026the US might have to resort\u201d to the new tariffs on top of the 25% steel and 10% aluminum duties already imposed by Trump. Perhaps most of all, they were unsettled that the Mexicans had gone along with the power play. Foreign Minister Luis Videgaray said he preferred a three-way deal, but \u201cthere will be a free-trade agreement with the United States regardless of whether Canada continues or not.\u201d That\u2019s why Canadian Foreign Minister Chrystia Freeland \u2013 who refused a meeting with US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer last Friday \u2013 is cutting short her European trip and heading to Washington on Tuesday. The Trump Administration will be hoping for a quick Ottawa surrender, having agreed with the Mexicans on steps that could include punitive tariffs on Canadian softwood lumber and a curb on Canada\u2019s support for its dairy industry. Yet if Prime Minister Justin Trudeau\u2019s staff were declaring a \u201cconstructive\u201d phone call with Trump yesterday, Freeland\u2019s office were signaling No Capitulation: \u201cWe will only sign a new NAFTA that is good for Canada and good for the middle class. Canada\u2019s signature is required.\u201d And this in turn could complicate Trump\u2019s tariff-trade approach that he hopes will Make America Great Again. The Trump administration has support for a quick outcome from Mexico, which wants the white smoke of success before President Enrique Pe\u00f1a Nieto leaves office on December 1. Given a 90-day process for Trump\u2019s signature and US Congressional approval, that sets the Friday deadline for Canada to get on board. But while the Canadians may well give some ground on certain issues, they may not be keen to do so with a political and economic gun at their heads. US and Mexico reach a preliminary trade deal that could replace NAFTA And amid the complexity of trade discussions \u2013 the US and Mexico took months to get to Monday\u2019s announcement \u2013 Ottawa could easily spin out this process to deny Trump his pre-election victory. Why does this matter? Because few Americans are likely to know the details of any agreement, the Trump strategy is to oversell the headline. Monday\u2019s \u201cUS-Mexico trade agreement\u201d was in fact a relatively small revision of the original NAFTA deal that Trump described as the \u201cworst trade deal ever made.\u201d There were changes to the levels of inputs from NAFTA countries into the manufacture of automobiles, a requirement that 40% to 45% of the content of vehicles made in North America come from factories where workers earn at least $16 an hour, an understanding on intellectual property. But just as administration officials overplayed the announcement of an embassy in Jerusalem, and just as they told a flat-out lie about making NATO members pay money \u201cowed\u201d to the US, so they are gambling that style overshadows substance. That works if Canada gives in to the script. But will Trudeau, whom administration officials consigned to a \u201cspecial place in hell\u201d after June\u2019s G7 summit, want to accept the diktat? Will Canadians acquiesce in what could easily be seen as bullying by their neighbor to the south? Lawrence Herman, a former Canadian diplomat, summarized coolly on Monday: \u201cMr. Trump can lambaste Canada and make all kinds of threats\u2026but the fact is the NAFTA can only be revised if Canada agrees to implement the package after full review and Parliamentary consideration.\u201d Let the showdown begin.",

He was a speechwriter to ex-British Prime Minister and Labour Party leader Tony Blair and was communications director to former Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. \u201cYou talkin\u2019 to me? You talkin\u2019 to me? You talkin\u2019 to me?\u201d goes Robert de Niro\u2019s monologue in Taxi Driver. There have been many times in politics \u2013 and more frequently since the rise of social media \u2013 when that has felt like the most appropriate response to an outrageous statement. But never more so than when the 2013 remarks of Jeremy Corbyn, the leader of the UK\u2019s opposition Labour Party, about British Zionists were revealed by the Daily Mail newspaper: \u201c[British Zionists] clearly have two problems. One is they don\u2019t want to study history, and secondly, having lived in this country for a very long time, probably all their lives, they don\u2019t understand English irony either\u2026 They needed two lessons, which we could perhaps help them with.\u201d Anti-Semitism is so bad in Britain that some Jews are planning to leave My immediate thought was \u201cDoes he mean me?\u201d I\u2019m British and I\u2019m a Zionist. I\u2019m not Jewish \u2013 I\u2019m actually a Scottish Catholic \u2013 but I am a Zionist since I fully support the right of the state of Israel to exist, the right of Jews worldwide to have a homeland and the right to self-determination. The other words fit me too. I\u2019ve lived in this country for a very long time \u2013 most of my life in fact. And as a Scot, maybe I don\u2019t really get English irony. But did he mean me? How can one get to the truth? The police have a simple test. In any investigation, they say the most important question to start with is \u201cWho are his friends?\u201d Well, who are Jeremy\u2019s friends in this attack on Zionists? \u201cGo, Jezza!\u201d went one tweet from an enthusiastic supporter who saw the news article as part of what he termed a \u201chysterical #Zionist media campaign.\u201d Unfortunately for Corbyn, this enthusiastic supporter was none other than Nick Griffin, the former leader of the fascist British National Party and a man who calls himself a \u201cLifelong white rights fighter.\u201d To be honest, unfortunate isn\u2019t the word \u2013 it is disgusting that the words of the leader of the Labour Party can be endorsed by such a man. And the nauseating thing is that this is not the first time. Former KKK leader David Duke was effusive in his praise of Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s election as Labour leader: \u201cIt\u2019s a really good kind of evolutionary thing, isn\u2019t it, when people are beginning to recognize Zionist power and ultimately the Jewish establishment power in Britain and in the western world.\u201d Anti-Zionism, I always thought, was the anti-Semitism of fools. But these words by Jeremy Corbyn show something far darker. He certainly uses English idioms, but the one that is most contemptible of all \u2013 the lower middle-class racism that masquerades as false exasperation \u2013 is that people won\u2019t just fit in. They\u2019ve lived here \u201call their lives.\u201d They haven\u2019t \u201cstudied history.\u201d They don\u2019t understand \u201cEnglish.\u201d If Boris Johnson had used these words of Black or Asian Britons, then Corbyn would have been the first to be self-righteously tweeting. But he felt free to say them of British Zionists, and I am finding it very hard to believe that by this he did not mean British Jews. How anti-Semitism crept into Europe's political mainstream Jeremy Corbyn claims he has an unblemished track record of fighting racism. These words contradict that. Read properly, they are terrifying. Some find the idea that British Jews need a lesson the most frightening of his comments. I disagree. Less often quoted is the part where Corbyn refers to \u201cthankfully silent Zionists\u201d \u2013 that is as sinister a statement as it is shocking. David Duke uses the words Zionist and Jew interchangeably. It is, indeed, a distinction without a difference. No attack on Zionism makes sense when applied to non-Jewish Zionists like me. No wonder this is the hill on which Corbyn\u2019s supporters are willing to die. Anti-Zionism is not anti-Semitism, they cry. And they have taken this all the way and used their votes on the Labour Party\u2019s ruling National Executive Committee to keep it from adopting the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance\u2019s definition of anti-Semitism in full. I often wondered why this was the pedantic battle they chose. I wonder no more.",

Tuesday night\u2019s apparent narrow Republican victory in Ohio keeps a seat red but offers warning signs for the party in power. The Republican National Committee showed real ground game competence even as it looks at a landscape that favors Democratic control of the US House. Moral victories for Democrats don\u2019t make majorities, but there are enough seats in play for them to win control if House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi doesn\u2019t drag her candidates down. My takeaways from Tuesday night: A win is a win. Holding the 12th Congressional District in Ohio offers temporary relief for Republicans against a deluge of gloom-and-doom stories about their prospects in the midterms. (Losing would have severely dried up fundraising and caused mass panic.) As they did in Georgia\u2019s 6th Congressional District special election last year, Democratic donors poured money into Danny O\u2019Connor\u2019s campaign, only to be disappointed on election night. Democrats did better here than they usually do, but suburban Delaware County, which delivered 54% of the vote to Republican Troy Balderson after giving Trump 54.5% in 2016, showed there are limits to how far to the left middle-class voters are willing to swing. Why? Pelosi is a real problem for Democrats. During the campaign, O\u2019Connor, in a torturous interview with Chris Matthews on MSNBC, admitted he would vote for whomever the Democratic nominee for House speaker is come January. Trouble is, as Matthews made clear, that person is going to be Pelosi. O\u2019Connor\u2019s admission was weaponized by Republicans, who know Pelosi is toxic among right-of-center voters and highly motivating for lazy Republicans who sometimes miss off-year elections. Pelosi will continue to hurt Democratic candidates who are trying to convince moderate suburban voters to come their way. Pelosi ought to appear in more Republican ads than any other human this fall. President Donald Trump can fairly take credit for helping Balderson win. During his victory speech, Balderson thanked Trump and Vice President Mike Pence for their support. Not mentioned: Ohio Gov. John Kasich, who also endorsed Balderson but caused him late trouble by claiming on television that the candidate didn\u2019t really want Trump to campaign for him. Both Trump and Pence held rallies and, according to Republicans strategists involved in the campaign, \u201cabsolutely juiced\u201d GOP turnout. Close Ohio special election strikes fear in GOP for midterms According to people familiar with the campaign\u2019s internal polling, Balderson, partly because of a statement he made regarding Social Security and Medicare, was in a \u201cfree-fall\u201d with two weeks to go. Then Pence and Trump showed up to stabilize the race as the RNC, raising record sums because of the President\u2019s engagement, provided ground game resources that delivered more than 1 million volunteer voter contacts. Democrats remain favorites to win the House in November. Democrats were much closer than the numbers and history indicate they should have been in Ohio. According to expert forecaster Dave Wasserman, there are 68 Republican-held seats that, on paper, are less Republican than Ohio\u2019s 12th District. Democrats need to flip just 23 seats to take over; there are 25 Republican-held districts in which Hillary Clinton bested Trump in 2016. Balderson was badly outspent candidate-to-candidate by O\u2019Connor, requiring a massive intervention from outside Republican groups. There isn\u2019t enough outside money to protect all 56 Republican incumbents who have been outraised by Democratic challengers; some Republican lawmakers who fail to put up their umbrella will get washed away in the storm. The Senate map still favors Republicans. Results from suburban Delaware County show Republican Balderson winning roughly the same percentage of the vote that Trump won in 2016, even as O\u2019Connor did better than Clinton (45.8% to Clinton\u2019s 38.7%). Republican strategist Brad Todd interprets this result as a sign Republicans remain strong favorites to hold their slim Senate majority, tweeting, \u201c\u2026 (I)f Senate R challengers run as well as Balderson did in suburban places like Delaware County\u2026they\u2019ll be just fine.\u201d Holding the Senate is crucial for Trump, as he can spend two years confirming judges even as a House Democratic majority tortures him with investigations and grinds his legislative agenda to a halt.  Social Security and Medicare still matter. The American economy is booming, but voters are still worried about retirement. Supporting an increase in the eligibility age for Social Security and Medicare nearly sank Balderson, and some congressional race polling indicates that preserving the safety net programs remains important to older Trump supporters. Trump, time and again as a candidate, promised he would save Social Security and Medicare and even attacked Republicans who had proposed adjustments to the programs. Republican candidates should learn a lesson here and make clear they will do everything they can to ensure the safety net remains solvent and that benefits will not be cut for voters over 50.",

View more opinion articles on CNN. One would be hard-pressed to find American billionaires as different in style and politics as the left-leaning financier Tom Steyer, the independently-minded data and media titan Mike Bloomberg, and the conservative oil, ranching and textile barons Charles G. Koch and David H. Koch. Yet, after Tuesday\u2019s barrage of tweets by President Donald Trump \u2013 in which he slammed the Kochs on Twitter, calling them \u201ca total joke\u201d \u2013 Trump has seemingly achieved the impossible. In a master class of how one can bridge the great American political divide and work across party lines, the President has managed to unify America\u2019s most politically-active billionaires, from left to middle to right toward one singular goal: clipping the wings of his presidency by making sure more Democrats are elected to Congress  in this fall\u2019s midterms. Bradley Honan, a longtime Democratic strategist who has advised both Bill and Hillary Clinton, Michael Bloomberg, Jon Corzine, Tony Blair and scores of other left-of-center candidates, told me, \u201cTrump \u2013 the great divider \u2013 has finally done some uniting after all. Billionaires don\u2019t like Trump, his policies or how he conducts himself. \u201c While it stands to reason that most of America\u2019s billionaires \u2013 particularly those with an eye toward the bottom line \u2013 are privately toasting the Trump administration\u2019s efforts to cut taxes and slash regulations, those who have voiced their opinions more publicly have been less kind. For Tom Steyer, his personal disdain for the President has been anything but a secret. His direct-to-camera spots for his Need to Impeach PAC have been beamed into millions of living rooms across the US.  According to Politico, Steyer plans to spend  $110 million in 2018, making the billionaire financier the largest single source of campaign money on the left. Michael Bloomberg, the Independent former mayor of New York City, has pledged at least $80 million toward flipping the House in 2018. He views House Republicans as having been weak-kneed when it comes to challenging the leader of their party. \u201cCongress has essentially stopped acting as a co-equal branch of government, by failing to engage in the kind of oversight of the law that the Constitution requires and the public expect,\u201d wrote the former mayor in an op-ed titled Why I\u2019m Supporting Democrats in 2018. Koch group: We're not an appendage of any party And now come the Koch Brothers, the Libertarian, free-trade stalwarts of the economic wing of the GOP, as the latest billionaires to send a shot across the bow of the pro-Trump populist wing of the Republican Party. During a recent confab for the Koch-backed Americans for Prosperity political advocacy group, it was announced that the Kochs would no longer solely support Republican candidates in this fall\u2019s midterms. Charles Koch, in a rare on-the-record moment of truth, added that \u201cI don\u2019t care what initials are in front or after somebody\u2019s name,\u201d referring to the (R) or (D) that often identify Congressmen and their parties. It\u2019s not surprising that the Koch\u2019s have taken issue with Trump; their devotion to free-trade and open markets sits squarely at odds with Trump\u2019s assertion that \u201cTrade wars are good and easy to win.\u201d But what set the President off on a Twitter attack against the Kochs was the notion that they might actually back a handful of Democrats in this fall\u2019s midterm elections. He tweeted, \u201cThe globalist Koch Brothers, who have become a total joke in real Republican circles, are against Strong Borders and Powerful Trade. I never sought their support because I don\u2019t need their money or bad ideas. They love my Tax & Regulation Cuts, Judicial picks & more. I made them richer. Their network is highly overrated, I have beaten them at every turn. They want to protect their companies outside the U.S. from being taxed, I\u2019m for America First & the American Worker - a puppet for no one. Two nice guys with bad ideas. Make America Great Again!\u201d Trump\u2019s attack followed a divisive weekend, in which the Koch network said it would not be supporting Republican Rep. Kevin Cramer of North Dakota, who is seeking to unseat Democratic Sen. Heidi Heitkamp. Why Mike Bloomberg is betting $80 million on the Democrats \u201cI know this is uncomfortable,\u201d said Emily Seidel, the CEO of Americans for Prosperity, but \u201cif you are a Republican who sits on the committee that wrote the worst spending bill in our country\u2019s history and you voted for it, you\u2019re darn right we will hold you accountable.\u201d Some astute political observers are betting that the Kochs would prefer a more narrowly divided Congress \u2013 which would force Republicans to coalesce around traditional Republican economic principles, many of which are at odds with Trump\u2019s populist riff on the GOP. But for Trump, the Kochs are playing with fire, and the stakes of the 2018 midterms couldn\u2019t be higher. A Democrat-controlled House could prove to be a major factor in whether House investigations into all things Trump and Russia are reignited and, more importantly, whether articles of impeachment actually make it to the floor of the House pending the recommendations of the investigation of special counsel Robert Mueller. Bradley Tusk, a former campaign manager for Bloomberg, said to me, \u201cTrump knows the balance of the House \u2013 and maybe the Senate \u2013 hangs in the midterms.\u201d \u201cWhen you handicap the outcome, having multiple billionaires heavily funding campaigns to oust your supporters isn\u2019t helpful. It\u2019s a topsy-turvy world and the old norms don\u2019t always apply, but the extra outside money certainly isn\u2019t good for the White House\u2019s interests.\u201d But could it all backfire?  Bill Hillsman, a political ad man who has elected populist and outsider candidates, such as Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura, told me he sees potential peril in the notion that a bunch of Palm Beach, Manhattan and Bay Area billionaires are banding together to take on the President\u2019s supporters in Congress in this fall\u2019s midterms. \u201cTrump has defied expectations in so many ways, but who thought ticking off billionaires across the political spectrum would be one of them?\u201d said Hillsman. \u201cBut there is a lesson here for those billionaires trying to compete with the biggest bully pulpit in America \u2013 unless your message resonates across the entire country, you run the risk of making the President even stronger. A billionaire who fights other billionaires has strong popular appeal. And no politician in American is better than Trump at capitalizing on his base\u2019s anti-elite sentiments.\u201d The Kochs, Bloomberg and Steyer all have different objectives behind their support of Democrats in this fall\u2019s elections, but if Trump is able to deftly package and brand them to the American public as being complicit in some sort of elitist cabal that is out to get him, it could give him some significant mileage with his base, particularly in those vulnerable districts where Republican incumbents are looking to hold on to their seats. Either way, the battle of the billionaires will be a theme to keep an eye on as the nation heads into election season.",

He is a partner at RunSwitch Public Relations in Louisville, Kentucky. Follow him on Twitter @ScottJenningsKY. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. The shameful smearing of Dr. Ronny Jackson, the White House physician who was nominated by President Donald Trump to be Secretary of the Veterans Affairs Administration and has now withdrawn, is example #967 of why people hate Washington D.C. and were in a revolutionary mood at the 2016 ballot box. Montana Senator Jon Tester in particular ought to be ashamed of publicly airing unproven allegations against a Navy Admiral and doctor who has served his nation and three Commanders-in-Chief with honor. Tester sullied the reputation of a good man and no doubt chilled many people who ever had a fleeting thought of offering themselves up for public service. Where does Jackson go to get his reputation back? Nowhere. The Internet is forever. I don\u2019t know if Dr. Jackson was the right man to lead the VA or not. That\u2019s what confirmation hearings are for \u2013 to discuss candidates\u2019 qualifications and assess their fitness. Clearly, Jackson should have been vetted, just as any presidential nominee should head to Capitol Hill. But debating Jackson\u2019s qualifications in committee and Tester\u2019s short-circuiting the process with his McCarthy-like smear campaign are two different things. After all, most of Jackson\u2019s White House service came during President Barack Obama\u2019s eight years. Two of the accusations \u2013 that Dr. Jackson drunkenly banged on a female colleague\u2019s hotel door in the middle of the night and wrecked a government vehicle \u2013 were busted over the weekend. The Secret Service disputed the allegations of door-banging and the White House, according to the Washington Post, said officials reviewed Jackson\u2019s vehicle records and found \u201cthree minor incidents\u201d but \u201cno evidence\u201d that Jackson had wrecked a car. Trump: Nobody has experience to run VA Tester\u2019s allegations painted a picture of Jackson as some sort of drunken, pill-pushing quack, handing out drugs willy-nilly (Tester claimed on national television Jackson was called \u201cThe Candyman\u201d) and generally conducting himself dishonorably. These allegations were so outrageous that Jonathan Swan, the reporter from Axios who broke the original story that Jackson\u2019s nomination was in trouble, refused to print them. In an interview with Fox News, Swan expressed a \u201csense of deep concern and anger\u201d about how Tester and the media circulated the accusation against Jackson \u201cbecause I broke that stupid story on Sunday\u2026 [that] his confirmation is in peril\u2026The reason I wrote it that way is not because I didn\u2019t know what the allegations were. I was given them on Friday. I knew what these allegations were. But I don\u2019t know if they are true \u2026 So I\u2019m not just going to go, \u2018Well, it\u2019s alleged, and I am hearing that this guy did all of these terrible things, and x, y, and z,\u2019 because I have no idea if it\u2019s true or not. And clearly neither does Jon Tester. Surely, this is a problem.\u201d If Tester believes his allegations are true, why didn\u2019t he demand emergency hearings about how an alcohol-fueled pill mill was being run out of the White House? Why aren\u2019t we demanding an inquiry into how someone of such low character was entrusted with the President\u2019s health for eight years? Trump targets Democrats after failed VA nomination I\u2019m not buying it. But don\u2019t take my word for it. Look at what President Obama himself wrote about Dr. Jackson\u2019s service in performance reviews over the years: \u201cRonny\u2019s positive impact cannot be overstated. He is a tremendous asset to the entire White House team.\u201d Obama called Dr. Jackson \u201ca most impressive leader,\u201d recommended him for promotion, and praised his \u201cincredible work ethic and follow-through.\u201d Some of these compliments and recommendations came after the supposed car wrecks and door-banging incident; that\u2019s hardly the kind of endorsement one gets from the President of the United States after making a habit of acting recklessly. Ronny Jackson may not have been the best choice to run the VA, but we\u2019ll never know thanks to the time-honored Washington tradition of destroying good people who raise their hands when the president asks them to step forward. Repeatedly of late, Democrats have been the ones to delay, try to block, and vote against qualified people for executive branch positions. Mike Pompeo, first in his class at West Point and a Harvard Law graduate who performed admirably as CIA Director, received 42 Democratic \u2018no\u2019 votes for the sin of having been nominated by Trump.  The appointment of Richard Grenell as Ambassador to Germany was delayed for more than one year, as Democrats objected to it moving forward on numerous occasions. He was finally confirmed last week, with the 42 Democrats voting no. Grenell is eminently qualified to serve as an ambassador with a long and distinguished career of diplomatic service during the Bush Administration. But that\u2019s no matter to the Democrats, who would prefer President Trump not staff his government. Having failed to beat him in an election, Democrats like Jon Tester and others are now playing a despicable game of maligning anyone who carries nomination papers signed by Donald J. Trump. They ought to be ashamed of themselves, and voters in November should hold this behavior against Tester and any other Democrat who participates in this craven D.C. circus.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Cape Town is enduring the worst water crisis to face a modern city, and its officials project it may run out of water next year, if not sooner. This is the first installment in Cape Town Diary, a series exploring how Cape Town\u2019s water crisis is affecting the daily life of its residents. Raymond Joseph is a freelance journalist living and working in Cape Town. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. Popping into my local supermarket in Cape Town a few days ago, I noticed something I\u2019d never seen before \u2013 a long line of people queuing out the door. A woman in the queue told me they were waiting for a delivery of bottled water, as the store had run out of it earlier in the day. A few minutes later, I watched as workers wheeled out pallets stacked high with five-liter bottles of water. Suddenly, pandemonium broke out as people pushed, shoved and argued in their rush to pack shopping trolleys with as many bottles as possible. Sadly, this is nothing new. On Wednesday, a fight broke out on a quiet suburban road where one of several natural springs bubbles to the surface. Those in the know have collected free water from these springs for years, but now these once-quiet spots are overrun with people converging from all over the city throughout the day and night. Tempers are frayed and arguments regularly ensue, forcing the city to post metro police at the various springs to keep the peace. Welcome to Cape Town 2018, where the dams that feed the city are at an all-time low after three successive years of far below-average rainfall. Cape Town is a winter rainfall area, and the earliest we can expect heavy rain is late April \u2013 assuming, and this is a big assumption, that normal rainfall returns after several years without. Not surprisingly, everywhere you go in the city, there is just one topic of conversation: water. With authorities estimating that Cape Town could be just 75 days away from becoming the first major city in the world to run out of water, websites and Facebook pages like this one have mushroomed. A common theme is tips and hints on saving water and posts by MacGyver-types with innovative ideas and inventions. And the ante has just been upped: Beginning February 1, the local authority introduced the most severe water restrictions yet in Cape Town\u2019s long history. Households are now restricted to 13.2 gallons (50 liters) per person, down from the previous limit of just under 23 gallons (87 liters) a day. With a total ban on watering of gardens and washing of cars, the daily ration must cover bathing or showering, clothes washing, flushing toilets, brushing teeth, washing hair, cooking, as well as drinking water for people and their pets. To put this in context, Americans use an average of 80 to 100 gallons per person each day. And that\u2019s not a ridiculous number when you consider that a 90-second shower uses almost 4 gallons of water and every toilet flush is over 2 gallons. Large fines are being introduced to punish water hogs who will be charged at a punitive rate that escalates dramatically as their usage increases.  For example, households that use up to 5,283 gallons (20,000 liters) per month will see their bill rise from just over $30 to $85 (or, in local currency, R361 to R1,536), while the bill for major consumers who use 12,308 gallons (50,000 liters) will jump from $243 to $1,738 (or, in local currency, a jump from R2,889 to R20,619). The frenzy around water reminds me of the fear among some people in the run-up to South Africa\u2019s first democratic election in the 1994, which brought Nelson Mandela and the African National Congress (ANC) to power.  With violence and bombs going off in the weeks leading up to the elections, many feared that civil war was imminent and began hoarding essentials like canned food and non-perishable foods, candles and fuel \u2013 but not, strangely, water. Everyone took it for granted that the taps would keep running. So how did we get here? And what\u2019s it like learning to treat water as the precious resource that it is?  The how is littered with missed chances and a failure to address warnings of a future crisis going back many years. As far back as 1990, South Africa\u2019s Water Research Commission cautioned Cape Town could run out of water within 17 years. And yet, no concrete steps were taken to prepare for this eventuality. The crisis has been complicated by politicians playing the blame game about who\u2019s at fault.  And as the true extent of the drought became clear, a war of words has broken out between the ANC-run national government and Cape Town\u2019s provincial and municipal opposition Democratic Alliance-run governments over who was responsible and who will lead on action steps moving forward. But while the politicians bicker, we are attempting to adjust to a new reality. Almost overnight, new industries have sprung up around water \u2013 like these water-from-air machines, grey water systems and composting and other non-flush toilets. \u201cWaterpreneurs\u201d are bringing in truckloads of bottled water and tankers filled with potable water. And those who can afford it are digging wells deep below the surface to find safe drinking water.  In our home, which is not dissimilar to many middle-class homes in Cape Town, we now run less than an inch of water into a bath, for shaving and washing our bodies and hair. The grey water is then collected and stored in buckets to flush the toilets and to water plants.  We now wear outer clothes for longer periods of time, limiting the number of times we have to wash clothes per month. Grey water from the washing machine is also harvested and used on the garden and to flush toilets. This is the new normal for Cape Town. It is also a timely warning for people living elsewhere in the world to preserve and use the water they have sparingly before they, too, face their own Day Zero.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Timothy Stanley is a historian and columnist for Britain\u2019s Daily Telegraph. He is the author of \u201cCitizen Hollywood: How the Collaboration Between LA and DC Revolutionized American Politics.\u201d The opinions expressed in this commentary are his. It must be a mark of how middle-aged and middle-of-the-road I\u2019ve become that I\u2019m actually excited about Mitt Romney running for the Senate. I\u2019ll explain why I\u2019m offering my support later \u2013 because far more important is that Donald Trump has beaten me to it. The President posted an endorsement of Romney\u2019s Utah candidacy on Twitter. Romney replied with gratitude. This is surprising given their famous animosity, but it speaks to how complicated conservative politics has become. The nadir of the Romney/Trump relationship was 2016, when Romney, realizing that Trump was about to take the Republican nomination, denounced him as a \u201cfraud\u201d who was \u201cplaying the American public for suckers.\u201d Trump replied that Romney had \u201cchoked like a dog\u201d in his 2012 race against Barack Obama. These insults sum up their vastly different approaches to politics. Romney dislikes Trump because he thinks he is dishonest and divisive. Trump dislikes Romney because he is a loser. Now that Romney\u2019s running for the Senate, it\u2019s hard not to see him as a potential leader of mainstream conservative opposition to Trump. He didn\u2019t mention the President in his announcement video, but he did call for greater \u201crespect\u201d in politics and suggested that legal immigrants should be welcomed. Should Mitt win \u2013 and, for the moment, he has little competition \u2013 he would be a critic of stature and celebrity in Congress. The strange history of Romney and Trump The gentlemanly exchange between Trump and Romney is a tacit acknowledgment of each other\u2019s significance. But it also nods toward the nuance of their long relationship. Trump endorsed Romney in 2012. Trump claimed that Romney begged him for help during a primary season when he faced a surprisingly tough battle against Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum, that year\u2019s grassroots champions. Even then it was understood that Trump spoke for a nationalist base that Romney \u2013 incredibly rich and hopelessly patrician \u2013 struggled to reach. He\u2019ll need those voters if he wants a landslide in Utah in 2018. It\u2019s true that Trump was never popular in Utah and that a local Romney-esque candidate called Evan McMullin did rather well in 2016. But it\u2019s still heavily GOP and Trump\u2019s backers are still a critical part of any local electoral coalition. That Romney cannot alienate them too much is a challenge faced by moderate Republicans across America. Go too far toward open revolt and you could find yourself dangerously at odds with your own voters. A similar calculation is bound to be running through Trump\u2019s head. Romney is too important and too skilled to dismiss entirely. Trump has always known that he needs Republicans like Mitt to take and hold the White House. Mitt Romney releases ad for Utah Senate run Romney says that in the aftermath of the 2016 election \u2013 during which he accused Trump of \u201cvile degradations\u201d \u2013 he was surprised to receive a phone call from Mike Pence asking him if he\u2019d audition for a senior Cabinet role. Perhaps secretary of state? In the end, says Romney, they just disagreed too much for Romney to accept a job, but not before Romney said Trump was \u201cenlightening, and interesting, and engaging.\u201d In fact their brief flirtation over a table in a three-star Michelin restaurant highlighted how similar they actually are. They\u2019re both upper-middle class, both patriotic, both pro-capitalism and both businessman noted for spotting and promoting talent. Trump could see the value of Romney, even if they had violently disagreed in the past. And Trump knows just how much trouble \u2013 or use \u2013 Romney could be to him in the Senate. Donald Trump: Mitt Romney 'let us down' Trump has shaken up politics. His own Republican nomination was a surprise; another was that opposing it brought Romney back into the national spotlight. Between them, they represent vastly different approaches to conservatism competing for dominance in the same party, a party that is trying to preserve a fragile governing coalition. If Romney makes it to the Senate, it\u2019ll be fascinating to see how these two powerful individuals dance around each other. And I hope he does make it. America needs to hear a voice of Republican moderation that explicitly rejects prejudice. It also needs an opposition on the Hill that\u2019s not the Democrats, whose slide into radical identity politics puts them way beyond the mainstream of many middle-class Americans who don\u2019t like Trump but don\u2019t see an alternative. Moreover, Romney deserves a shot at national leadership because history has proven much of what he said in 2012 to be correct. The flaws in Obamacare, the threat of Russia, the dangers of excessive government have come to light. I wasn\u2019t a big fan to begin with \u2013 the guy can be odd \u2013 but he conducted himself throughout that campaign with remarkable tolerance and dignity. Romney is a good man in a political world that has tolerated bad behavior for far too long.",

The views expressed in this commentary are his own. Amazon Go, the online retailer\u2019s first completely automated store, debuted in Seattle last week. Using a bevy of smart cameras, deep machine learning and artificial intelligence (AI) algorithms, the store makes it possible for shoppers to simply pick up the products they like and go, with their accounts being automatically charged for the products \u2013 completely eliminating the need for cashiers and checkout lines. Though staff members still stock the shelves, they will likely soon be replaced by robots. This is revolutionary and will likely be how all stores will operate in the near future. Stores won\u2019t have to invest in employees \u2013 salaries, training, overtime, health care. Customers will like it, too. No more standing in boring check-out lines, interacting with indifferent staff. What we are witnessing is surely the future of the retail industry, but there is also a downside that needs our attention. Cashiers and retail workers are two of the most common occupations in the US, employing roughly 8 million people, many of who tend to be younger, white women, making modest yearly incomes in the $20,000-$25,000 range. Most of these jobs require little formal education for entry, and so the sector supports many individuals with relatively low skills and education who are likely to find it particularly hard to quickly retool and fit a different employment sector. Most of them will likely find themselves jobless. Of course, this isn\u2019t the only sector that AI will decimate. Driverless trucks are already being tested on major highways. They, too, have many advantages over today\u2019s long haulers: they can run 24/7 and never get fatigued; no need for mandatory breaks; no more wasted fuel idling overnight. Truck drivers account for a third of the cost of this $700 billion industry, and there are over 1 million mostly middle-aged, white male truckers in the US. Their jobs will be rendered obsolete. And these numbers will likely be even higher once driverless cars replace all taxi and local delivery drivers. When machines outsmart humans Such fears of computing-led obsolescence aren\u2019t new. In 1964, less than a few years after IBM had launched the first solid-state mainframe computer, \u201cThe Twilight Zone\u201d ran a skit titled \u201cThe Brain Center at Whipple\u2019s\u201d \u2013 where Mr. Whipple, the owner of a vast manufacturing corporation replaced all his factory workers with a room-sized computing machine. Mr. Whipple\u2019s economic justification for his \u201cX109B14 modified transistorized totally automated machine\u201d could just as well be applied to AI: \u201cIt costs 2 cents an hour to run \u2026 it lasts indefinitely \u2026 it gets no wrinkles, no arthritis, no blocked arteries \u2026 two of them replace 114 men who take no coffee breaks, no sick leaves, no vacations with pay.\u201d In the show, Whipple\u2019s machine quickly replaced everyone from the plant\u2019s workers to its foremen to all the secretaries. The story was prescient and many of its fictionalized fears in time came true: Most of the large manufacturing plants were indeed shut down; secretaries and typists mostly became obsolete; and the jobs that created the American middle-class were all eventually outsourced. Much of this computer-driven automation replaced low-skilled easily routinizable functions. But AI is different. It utilizes deep-learning algorithms and acquires skills, so it can routinize many complex functions. Should we fear killer robots? Take journalism \u2013 a task that has always been performed by humans. After its purchase of The Washington Post last year, Amazon tested Heliograf, a new AI based writing program that automates report-writing using predefined narrative templates and phrases. From the Olympics to the elections, the software has already auto-published close to 1,000 articles. And given its ability to churn through virtually any amount of data and spit out endless reports instantaneously, AI newsbots are way better than humans. It\u2019s no surprise then that USA Today, Reuters, BuzzFeed and growing numbers of financial organizations are already employing AI for tasks ranging from reporting to data authentication. In the near future, AI will replace many other such so-called highly skilled professions, from chefs to pilots and surgeons. Going back to school, learning new skills and retooling might not be an option because it would be impossible to learn as quickly, provide the kind the nuance from distilling terabytes of information or outpace AI. And besides, by the human-time it takes to acquire a new skill, AI might have learned to replace it. If these trends materialize \u2013 and some might not \u2013 we are looking at a seismic shift in the American economy. If the last election was a push back against globalization, imagine what a rage against AI will look like.  The solution, of course, is not to stop the march of progress but to prepare for it with forward thinking investments in education, human capital and public policy. While Washington is busy cleaning up yesterday\u2019s self-inflicted mess, this is tomorrow\u2019s crisis that requires attention today. In the end of the Mr. Whipple skit, he, too, was rendered obsolete \u2013 by a robot. Rod Serling\u2019s ominous closing message: \u201cMan becomes clever instead of becoming wise; he becomes inventive and not thoughtful; and sometimes, as in the case of Mr. Whipple, he can create himself right out of existence.\u201d One hopes that this isn\u2019t what AI does to us.",

Joe Donnelly said Democrats need to be careful in promoting too many progressive ideas in red states like his because they\u2019ll \u201cstart losing the people in my state.\u201d \u201cMedicare-for-all\u201d is a progressive stance that some Democrats worry could alienate Midwestern voters from the party going into the 2020 presidential election. It has become popular thanks to liberal leaders like Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. When asked by CNN\u2019s Dana Bash on \u201cThe Lead With Jake Tapper\u201d if Democrats could be viable without appealing to interior state votes, Donnelly replied, \u201cI don\u2019t know how you do that.\u201d Donnelly said that during President Donald Trump\u2019s visits to Indiana in the weeks before the midterms \u2013 in which Donnelly lost his seat \u2013 the President made not voting for Republicans seem like a personal betrayal by voters. \u201cWe have not made enough of a connection \u2026 that the people of my state understand culturally, we (Democrats) want to make sure you succeed,\u201d he said. \u201cBut when you talk \u2018Medicare-for-all\u2019 \u2026you start losing the people in my state,\u201d Donnelly added. \u201cWhen we start talking about, \u2018Hey, we\u2019re going to work together with the insurance companies to lower premiums,\u2019 that\u2019s what connects.\u201d \u201cThe talk on the coasts just doesn\u2019t get it done in the middle,\u201d he said. \u201cMedicare-for-all\u201d has become a contentious issue for Democrats as they prepare to assume the majority in January. Some new House Democrats, such as Democratic socialist Rep.-elect Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, championed the issue on the campaign trail despite trepidation from other parts of the party. But Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi has indicated that she is open to considering a more public option during the new Congress. Republicans have seized on the buzzword, arguing that \u201cMedicare-for-all\u201d would threaten the program\u2019s availability for seniors. Trump published an op-ed just before the midterms bashing Democrats for threatening to \u201ceviscerate\u201d the program with such an expansion. Looking ahead to the presidential election, Donnelly cautioned that \u201cwho wins the primary is not necessarily the best person in a general election.\u201d While he declined to name a specific candidate he thought would fare best, Donnelly said the ideal candidate would engage directly with people in the interior states on issues such as manufacturing and health care. They would be the \u201ckind of person who can go into Michigan and go to the auto plant\u201d and have \u201ctalked to the workers there, and have talked to the families at the churches and have talked to them about how important it is for their kid to get decent health care,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople want to make sure they have a good job, decent health care, that they can retire with dignity and that they know that the future is better for their children and grandchildren,\u201d Donnelly added. \u201cWhen we talk about those things, we have success in the Midwest.\u201d",

            "article_content": "A federal judge in Texas said on Friday that the Affordable Care Act\u2019s individual coverage mandate is unconstitutional and that the rest of the law therefore cannot stand. Legal experts say the ruling won\u2019t immediately affect Americans\u2019 health coverage, and a group of states led by California is already vowing to appeal. But the invalidation of the landmark health care law popularly known as Obamacare throws into doubt the future of health coverage for millions of Americans on the Obamacare exchanges and in Medicaid expansion. The ruling and expected appeal sets up another cliffhanger in which the fate of the law, which Republicans have unsuccessfully tried to repeal for years, will likely once again ultimately lie with the Supreme Court. Chief Justice John Roberts cast the deciding vote leaving the law intact in 2012, but it\u2019s unclear how the justices will view this challenge, which centers on changes to the individual mandate that were baked into the 2017 tax reform. President Donald Trump, who campaigned in 2016 on a promise to undo Obamacare, was thwarted in Congress last year by a lone vote from the late Arizona Republican Sen. John McCain. Trump immediately tweeted in celebration on Friday and called on Congress to act. \u201cAs I predicted all along, Obamacare has been struck down as an UNCONSTITUTIONAL disaster! Now Congress must pass a STRONG law that provides GREAT healthcare and protects pre-existing conditions. Mitch and Nancy, get it done!\u201d Trump wrote. He later added, \u201cWow, but not surprisingly, ObamaCare was just ruled UNCONSTITUTIONAL by a highly respected judge in Texas. Great news for America!\u201d On Saturday, Trump told reporters that if the decision is eventually upheld by the Supreme Court, \u201cwe will be sitting down with the Democrats\u201d to \u201cget great health care for our people.\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s say repeal and replace, handled a little bit differently, but it was a big, big victory by a highly respected judge,\u201d Trump said during a visit to Arlington National Cemetery. Later Saturday, Obama took to Facebook to urge people to enroll in the program, writing in a post that Friday\u2019s ruling \u201ccan be a scary thing to hear, particularly if you or someone you care about has a pre-existing condition.\u201d \u201cAs this decision makes its way through the courts, which will take months, if not years, the law remains in place and will likely stay that way,\u201d he wrote. Democratic House leader Nancy Pelosi decried the ruling and suggested that the coming Democratic-led House will intervene in the case. \u201cRepublicans are fully responsible for this cruel decision and for the fear they have struck into millions of families across America who are now in danger of losing their health coverage,\u201d Pelosi said in a statement released late Friday. \u201cWhen House Democrats take the gavel, the House of Representatives will move swiftly to formally intervene in the appeals process to uphold the life-saving protections for people with pre-existing conditions and reject Republicans\u2019 effort to destroy the Affordable Care Act.\u201d Today, the law governs American health care. More than 4 million people have already signed up for 2019 coverage on the exchanges, and millions more are expected to pick plans before open enrollment ends Saturday. The ruling threatens to wipe away the Affordable Care Act\u2019s protections for those with pre-existing conditions, which became a focal point of the midterm elections and helped Democrats take the House. In his opinion, District Judge Reed O\u2019Connor said the \u201cIndividual Mandate can no longer be fairly read as an exercise of Congress\u2019s Tax Power and is still impermissible under the Interstate Commerce Clause\u2014meaning the Individual Mandate is unconstitutional.\u201d He also held that the individual mandate is \u201cessential to and inseverable from the remainder of the ACA.\u201d The case against the ACA was brought by 20 Republican state attorneys general and governors, as well as two individuals. It revolves around Congress effectively eliminating the individual mandate penalty by reducing it to $0 as part of the 2017 tax cut bill. The mandate requires nearly all Americans to get health insurance or pay a penalty. The Republican coalition, led by Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, is arguing that the change rendered the mandate itself unconstitutional. The states say that the voiding of the penalty, which takes effect next year, removes the legal underpinning the Supreme Court relied upon when it upheld the law in 2012 under Congress\u2019 tax power. The Trump administration said in June that it would not defend several important provisions of Obamacare in court. It agreed that zeroing out the penalty renders the individual mandate unconstitutional but argued that invalidates only the law\u2019s protections of those with pre-existing conditions. These include banning insurers from denying people policies or charging them more based on their medical histories, as well as limiting coverage of the treatment they need. But the administration maintained those parts of the law were severable and the rest of the Affordable Care Act could remain in place. Professor Tim Jost, of Washington and Lee University, noted that O\u2019Connor went further than the Trump administration had asked. \u201cThe Trump administration only asked that the individual mandate and provisions protecting individuals with pre-existing conditions be invalidated, but O\u2019Connor\u2019s order would invalidate many provisions of the Medicaid program, the Medicare program and other federal laws,\u201d he told CNN. But Jost said the structure of the challenge and of O\u2019Connor\u2019s ruling means that nothing will change right away. \u201cJudge O\u2019Connor has declared the individual mandate unconstitutional and the rest of the Affordable Care Act invalid, but he has not blocked its continued operation,\u201d Jost said. Because the administration would not defend the law, California, joined by 16 other Democratic states, stepped in. They argued that the mandate remains constitutional and that the rest of the law, in any event, can stand without it. Also, they said that eliminating Obamacare or the protections for those with pre-existing conditions would harm millions of Americans. California Attorney General Xavier Becerra called the ruling \u201can assault\u201d and a spokesperson for his office indicated an appeal would be coming. \u201cToday\u2019s ruling is an assault on 133 million Americans with preexisting conditions, on the 20 million Americans who rely on the ACA\u2019s consumer protections for healthcare, on America\u2019s faithful progress toward affordable healthcare for all Americans,\u201d Becerra said in a statement. \u201cThe ACA has already survived more than 70 unsuccessful repeal attempts and withstood scrutiny in the Supreme Court.\u201d American Medical Association president Barbara McAneny said the group will work with other groups in pursuing an appeal and reversal of the decision. \u201cToday\u2019s decision is an unfortunate step backward for our health system that is contrary to overwhelming public sentiment to preserve pre-existing condition protections and other policies that have extended health insurance coverage to millions of Americans,\u201d she said in a statement. \u201cIt will destabilize health insurance coverage by rolling back federal policy to 2009. No one wants to go back to the days of 20 percent of the population uninsured and fewer patient protections, but this decision will move us in that direction.\u201d Meanwhile, Paxton applauded the ruling and said it represents a massive check on federal power. \u201cToday\u2019s ruling enjoining Obamacare halts an unconstitutional exertion of federal power over the American health care system while our multistate coalition lawsuit works its way through the courts,\u201d Paxton said in a staement. \u201cOur lawsuit seeks to effectively repeal Obamacare, which will give President Trump and Congress the opportunity to replace the failed social experiment with a plan that ensures Texans and all Americans will again have greater choice about what health coverage they need and who will be their doctor.\u201d Steve Vladeck, a CNN legal analyst and a law professor at the University of Texas School of Law, said he felt an appeal could be looked on favorably by the Supreme Court. \u201cThe ruling relies on conclusions about who can bring this suit and about the impact of President Trump\u2019s tax bill that have been widely debunked by scholars from across the political spectrum,\u201d Vladeck said. \u201cIt will certainly generate headlines, and it may even be upheld by the conservative federal appeals court in Texas, but it\u2019s difficult to imagine that the Supreme Court\u2014which has already turned away two challenges to the ACA\u2014would agree with tonight\u2019s ruling.\u201d The lawsuit entered the spotlight during the midterm elections, helping propel many Democratic candidates to victory. Protecting those with pre-existing conditions became a central focus of the races. Some 58% of Americans said they trust Democrats more to continue the law\u2019s provisions, compared to 26% who chose Republicans, according to a Kaiser Family Foundation election tracking poll released in mid-October. The consumer protections targeted by the administration are central to Obamacare and transformed the health insurance landscape. Their popularity is one of the main reasons GOP lawmakers had such difficulty repealing Obamacare last year. \u201cGuaranteed issue\u201d requires insurers to offer coverage to everyone regardless of their medical history. Prior to the Affordable Care Act, insurers often rejected applicants who are or had been ill or offered them only limited coverage with high rates. Under the law\u2019s community rating provision, insurers are not allowed to set premiums based on a person\u2019s health history. And the ban on excluding pre-existing conditions from coverage meant that insurers cannot refuse to pay for treatments because of a policyholder\u2019s medical background. All these provisions meant millions of people with less-than-perfect health records could get comprehensive coverage. But they also have pushed up premiums for those who are young and healthy. This group would have likely been able to get less expensive policies that offered fewer benefits prior to Obamacare. That has put the measures in the crosshairs of Republicans seeking to repeal the law and lower premiums. It\u2019s no wonder that politicians on both sides of the aisle promised to protect those with pre-existing conditions during the election. Three-quarters of Americans say that it is \u201cvery important\u201d for the law to continue prohibiting health insurers from denying coverage because of medical histories, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation\u2019s September tracking poll \u2013 58% of Republicans feel the same way. And about the same share of Americans say it\u2019s \u201cvery important\u201d that insurers continue to be barred from charging sick people more.

            "article_content": "As Rep. Nancy Pelosi took the stage in a noisy hotel ballroom in Washington on election night she was greeted with chants of \u201cSpeaker! Speaker! Speaker!\u201d Her party had just won back the House of Representatives, and the longtime Democratic leader and first woman in history to hold the speaker\u2019s gavel was poised to do it again. But many of the Democrats who made that victory possible had also made a big promise: They wouldn\u2019t support Pelosi for speaker. Those dynamics set the stage for an internal party dispute that would soon play out in the halls of Congress, as Pelosi flexed the muscle she\u2019d built over years as a relentless negotiator to once again keep her caucus in line. Less than 24 hours after she gave her victory speech on election night, roughly a dozen incumbent Democrats joined a conference call to game out ways to bring change to party leadership for the first time in more than a decade. They would need a relatively small number of Democrats to prevent Pelosi from getting 218 votes come January, when the full House holds its speaker election. Given the small group of incumbents lining up to oppose her \u2013 plus the incoming freshmen already in the anti-Pelosi column \u2013 the group of detractors felt good about their numbers. \u201cI am 100% confident we can forge new leadership,\u201d Rep. Filemon Vela of Texas told CNN a week after the election. Publicly, Pelosi was unfazed by the opposition. She went on a media barnstorm around Election Day, repeating in interview after interview that she felt confident she would be speaker again, despite the math problem that lay before her. \u201cThis is not a day at the beach, this is politics,\u201d Pelosi said in an interview with CNN\u2019s Chris Cuomo. In nearly the same breath, she, too, asserted she was \u201c100%\u201d confident she would win. The next month would be a battle over who was right: the powerful, veteran lawmaker from California known for never backing down, or the small group of Democrats desperate for change at the top. They were ready to duke it out over the long haul, even if that meant an ugly floor fight on the first day of the new Congress. Pelosi's meme-tastic coat so popular it will be re-issued Meanwhile, Pelosi was busy on another negotiating front trying to avert a partial government shutdown. On Tuesday, she sat down for the now-famous meeting with President Donald Trump and the Senate\u2019s top Democrat, Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York, in the Oval Office. The public got a rare look at the Pelosi who Democrats have talked about for years \u2013 the fearless, unyielding leader who\u2019s commanded respect from so many, even if in an intimidating way. Pelosi\u2019s performance instantly went viral online, particularly when the President suggested she might be weakened in the negotiations because of her fight back at home for speaker. \u201cMr. President, please don\u2019t characterize the strength that I bring to this meeting as the leader of the House Democrats, who just won a big victory,\u201d she shot back. RELATED: Pelosi\u2019s meme-tastic coat so popular it will be re-issued While Trump and Democrats aren\u2019t close to a deal on a spending measure, Pelosi and her Democratic challengers were ready to wrap things up. Exactly five weeks after that conference call among the so-called rebels, the two sides announced an agreement on Wednesday, each giving concessions that would all but guarantee Pelosi would become speaker \u2013 but only for four more years, at most. It was preordained that Pelosi would have a speaker fight. With Republicans spending tens of millions of dollars in the midterms to paint her as the villain, Democrats were asked in races across the country whether they would support her for the job. According to a CNN count leading up to the election, close to 30 Democratic incumbents and new candidates who had solid chances of winning in November were firmly on the record opposing Pelosi. While she enjoyed support from the vast majority of her caucus, it would take only a small number to thwart her speakership chances in January. In October, Pelosi told the Los Angeles Times she would be a \u201ctransitional\u201d speaker. It wasn\u2019t too surprising a statement \u2013 Pelosi is 78 \u2013 but it was one of her first serious nods that she wasn\u2019t planning to be in the top spot indefinitely. Pelosi: 'I feel very responsible' to carry through with term limits deal \u201cI have things to do. Books to write; places to go; grandchildren, first and foremost, to love,\u201d she said. As to when she would be leaving Congress, Pelosi didn\u2019t budge. \u201cDo you think I would make myself a lame duck right here over this double espresso?\u201d she said in the LA Times interview. Over the next several weeks, Pelosi would continue to keep her timeline a mystery. With no clear end in sight, the promise of a transition wasn\u2019t enough to ease the concerns of those wanting new leadership \u2013 and wanting it soon. A week after the election, the group of rebels started collecting signatures on a letter vowing to oppose Pelosi for speaker, eventually releasing it with 16 names. They claimed others were also a \u201cno\u201d but declined to publicly sign the letter. The lobbying effort of the anti-Pelosi freshmen also kicked into full gear. The detractors were in constant communication, educating them on the speaker vote process and reminding them it would be their first vote in Congress \u2013 and would they really want to break a campaign promise on their first day in office? Meanwhile, Pelosi supporters were furious at the idea that Democrats would deny a woman the speakership after record numbers of women won on Election Day. Pelosi helped raise $135 million for Democrats, and she was widely regarded as an effective leader, even by some of her critics. The most common complaint was she had simply been there too long and amassed too much power over the caucus. Pelosi backers were also swarming the incoming freshmen with texts and phone calls, making it clear that Pelosi had most of the caucus behind her. Freshmen were told that a vote against Pelosi would be a vote for the Republicans, which wasn\u2019t entirely true, as a member can vote for anyone for speaker. But it was a talking point that took hold in November and would be repeated by members as they weighed their options. Amid all the lobbying and public posturing, the detractors had one escalating problem: They couldn\u2019t find anyone to run against Pelosi. Rep. Tim Ryan of Ohio, who had challenged Pelosi two years ago for minority leader and won nearly a third of the caucus, toyed with the idea of another run but didn\u2019t step forward. Rising Democratic stars like Reps. Hakeem Jeffries of New York and Cheri Bustos of Illinois sought lower-level leadership positions. Reps. Steny Hoyer of Maryland and Jim Clyburn of South Carolina, who\u2019ve long been ranked No. 2 and No. 3 after Pelosi, would consider a speaker run only if there were a vacancy at the top. As pressure mounted for a challenger to step forward, Rep. Marcia Fudge, a Democrat from Ohio and part of the group of detractors, considered the idea shortly before Thanksgiving. But within just a few days \u2013 and after a private sit-down with Pelosi \u2013 Fudge announced she was not only holding back from a challenge but also that she would be supporting Pelosi. At nearly the same time, it was also announced Fudge would chair a subcommittee on voting rights, an issue she\u2019s passionate about. And that\u2019s how Pelosi would slowly start picking off incumbents \u2013 one by one. Trump keeps everyone guessing over shutdown Soon after Fudge, Rep. Brian Higgins of New York, one of the 16 Democrats who had signed the anti-Pelosi letter, announced he would support Pelosi after she gave him reassurances on two of his pet issues \u2013 infrastructure and Medicare. Rep. Stephen Lynch of Massachusetts, another signatory, also flipped after private conversations with Pelosi. Higgins said others who had signed the anti-Pelosi letter were looking for an \u201cout,\u201d and he urged them to press Pelosi for policy commitments in exchange for support (like he did). \u201cLife is about leverage,\u201d Higgins said. The detractors saw Pelosi\u2019s powerful network in full force back at home. Protesters rattled Rep. Seth Moulton, one of the most vocal Pelosi critics, at one of his town halls in Massachusetts. Rep. Kathleen Rice, another outspoken critic, was getting calls from prominent donors and political figures in her home state of New York asking her to back down. Pelosi supporters also fueled a successful social media campaign that became known as #fivewhiteguys, framing the anti-Pelosi faction as a group of white men \u2013 even though it had multiple women and included a few members of the Congressional Black Caucus and Congressional Hispanic Caucus. One aide close to the rebels said the sexism campaign was unfair but effective and expressed regret that Fudge, a woman and member of the Congressional Black Caucus, didn\u2019t run, as her challenge would \u201chave at least tamped down the sexism cries.\u201d \u201cNo one wants to be called sexist. It had nothing to do with that,\u201d the aide said. \u201cIf it was Steny Hoyer at the top, it would be the same conversation about wanting new leadership.\u201d Soon after Thanksgiving, the caucus held its internal leadership election on a secret ballot to nominate its candidate for speaker. Pelosi won overwhelmingly, losing only 32 votes out of a caucus of 235 voting members. For Pelosi allies, flipping enough of those 32 Democrats seemed entirely doable. She still had plenty of leverage and plenty of time. But the detractors maintained they still had the numbers on their side and, even with no challenger, could prevent her from getting to 218 on the floor. Ryan, Moulton and Rice, on the same day as the caucus vote, had a meeting with Pelosi in her office. They requested that she leave before the end of her first term as the next speaker. The meeting went nowhere. Meanwhile, another leader in the small group, Rep. Ed Perlmutter of Colorado, had been privately negotiating with Pelosi. The two had a long-running relationship, as Perlmutter was not an outspoken member frequently in the headlines criticizing leadership. Despite some tension in the group over messaging and strategy, the Perlmutter talks soon became the clear avenue to any potential deal, and the Colorado lawmaker frequently kept the group up to speed on his conversations. Or as one Democratic aide put it: \u201cIn any war, there\u2019s a role for soldiers and diplomats. You need soldiers to do fighting, and then you need diplomats to end the fighting. Rarely are those two roles filled by the same person.\u201d Over the coming weeks, Perlmutter and Pelosi would have roughly a dozen conversations behind the scenes, but it wasn\u2019t until December 4 that the two reached a turning point. It was a quiet day on Capitol Hill. President George H.W. Bush was lying in state just down the hallway from Pelosi\u2019s office, and Washington was preparing for his funeral as story after story ran about Bush\u2019s kindness and decency. During a sit-down in her office with Perlmutter, Pelosi expressed openness to term limits for committee chairs and senior leadership. The moment became a game changer for the group of detractors. Over the next week, the conversation would narrow to focus solely on term limits for the party\u2019s top three leaders, which would affect Pelosi, Hoyer and Clyburn. The two men were aware of the negotiations but were not a part of them and were staunchly opposed to term limits. Perlmutter later reflected on tense conversations with the longtime leaders. \u201cThis place is based on relationships and (when) you start changing those relationships, you can strain some things,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cDifferent folks have different views of all of this. That\u2019s just the nature of life, but it certainly applies here.\u201d As word spread that term limits were now on the negotiating table, frustration grew among many in the caucus, especially among Congressional Black Caucus members, who have a history of opposing term limits. \u201cThis whole thing about these guys needing something so that they can land this damn plane is getting silly,\u201d said Rep. Cedric Richmond of Louisiana, chair of the Congressional Black Caucus. \u201cLand the plane. Vote for her. And let\u2019s please get on.\u201d Perlmutter then had a final sit-down with Pelosi. This time he was joined by Rep. Linda Sanchez of California, a member of leadership who made news last year when calling for a new generation of leaders, and Rep. Bill Foster of Illinois, another quiet leader among the so-called rebels. The trio turned heads as they had to walk through a bustling holiday reception for reporters to enter Pelosi\u2019s office. It was then that they locked in the deal. Pelosi would support a limit of three terms for senior leaders, with the option of running for a fourth and final term but only with approval from two-thirds of the caucus, rather than the traditional simple majority. Trump names Mulvaney 'acting' chief of staff The deal would be retroactive. Since Pelosi, Hoyer and Clyburn had already served two terms as speaker, majority leader and majority whip when Democrats last held power, they would be entering their third terms in 2019 and could run for one more term at most. The concession at first seemed striking, given how reluctant Pelosi had been to place any sort of timeline on her political future. The reality, though, is she was unlikely to stay for very long, anyway. In return, she won over seven of her detractors, all but guaranteeing she would get the 218 votes on the floor \u2013 yet still make it possible for some of the freshmen to uphold their campaign promises to vote against her on the floor. The deal was not warmly received by Hoyer and Clyburn. The caucus still has to vote on the term limits for the rules to officially change, and it\u2019s unclear whether they\u2019ll be approved. Pelosi has promised to abide by the term limits, anyway. \u201cI feel very comfortable about what they are proposing, and I feel very responsible to do that, whether it passes or not,\u201d she said at her weekly news conference Thursday. Some in the group notably didn\u2019t sign on to the deal. Rice, along with Reps. Kurt Schrader of Oregon and Jim Cooper of Tennessee, were three signatories of the original letter who still maintain their opposition. For some, the deal didn\u2019t go far enough; Pelosi would still be holding the reins \u2013 and possibly for another four years. Hatch says he regrets his 'I don't care' comment about Trump allegations But many in the group felt they got what they were looking for: a timeline for a transition and a commitment to training more future leaders. \u201cThese pieces put into place are going to create the churn,\u201d Sanchez said. Could Pelosi have gotten to 218 on her own, without striking the deal? \u201cShe may have,\u201d Perlmutter conceded. \u201cPeople were going one at a time in some respects. And her skills are real, so that\u2019s possible.\u201d But as a brutal, embarrassing floor fight on January 3 remained possible, the reticence was growing. \u201cThere was a recognition \u2026 is that how we wanted to start things?\u201d Perlmutter said. \u201cAnd the answer was at the end of the day: probably no.\u201d CNN\u2019s Manu Raju and Annie Grayer contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "The Trump administration isn\u2019t doing much to let Americans know it\u2019s time to sign up for Obamacare, so celebrities are trying to fill the void. Stephen Colbert, host of The Late Show, urged his Twitter followers to spread the word earlier this week after a former Obama official flagged that enrollment figures are down. More than 49,000 people answered Colbert\u2019s call by retweeting his post. Well then, let\u2019s help with that marketing! Retweet this, y\u2019all! https://t.co/s3MBOsgLJM Many celebrities have helped promote the Affordable Care Act over the years, recruited by former President Barack Obama to entice more people \u2013 particularly younger Americans \u2013 to sign up for coverage. But now they are doing it on their own, trying to keep the health law going as the Trump administration has slashed advertising by 90% and cut funding for enrollment assistance by 80%. Obamacare could use the help. The average number of people signing up daily on the federal exchange, healthcare.gov, for 2019 is down roughly 8% as of December 1 from the same period a year ago, according to figures released Thursday by the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. What\u2019s more, only a quarter of those who buy their own insurance or are uninsured know when open enrollment ends, according to a recent Kaiser Family Foundation poll. In most states, it\u2019s right around the corner on December 15. Colbert isn\u2019t the only celebrity stepping up this fall. Late-night host Jimmy Kimmel, singer-songwriter John Legend, actress Kerry Washington and actor Bradley Whitford have also urged people to sign up in recent weeks. ICYMI: Open enrollment is here. Hurry because it closes on 12|15. #GetCovered while you can. Visit the website https://t.co/PcYzMOjYAE or call call 1-800-318-2596. A great holiday gift to yourself!  Make sure you #GetCovered! https://t.co/ziuiP3lEqN One celebrity who hasn\u2019t said much this year, however, is Obama himself. In 2017, Obama kicked off the open enrollment period with an 80-second video on Twitter and Facebook touting many of Obamacare\u2019s benefits. He noted that eight in 10 people can find policies for $75 a month or less and brought back one of his favorite marketing points: \u201cThat\u2019s cheaper than a lot of cell phone plans.\u201d Facebook post not found. Post has been removed or is no longer public. Then, a few days before open enrollment ended, he reminded folks of the deadline on Twitter and Facebook and joined a conference call to thank several hundred people who are helping Americans select plans. So far this year, Obama\u2019s response has been more muted. He noted the November 1 launch of open enrollment on his social media accounts, but amid a flurry of posts urging people to vote in the midterm elections to protect the law and those with pre-existing conditions. The former President also mentioned open enrollment in public remarks and in a podcast with David Axelrod, who served as his senior adviser. Speaking of preexisting conditions, open enrollment starts today. If you or someone you know needs health care, visit https://t.co/ob1Ynoesod. Thanks to financial help, most people can find plans for $75/month or less, so check out your options and find a plan that works for you. pic.twitter.com/R52X9sgkbP Overall, sign ups on the federal exchange are expected to drop by 800,000 this year, according to former Obama administration official Joshua Peck, who co-founded Get America Covered, an advocacy group that seeks to boost enrollment. Total enrollment in Obamacare for 2019 also depends on how its faring in the 11 states, plus the District of Columbia, that run their own exchanges. The state exchanges typically pour more money into advertising open enrollment, allow people more time to pick plans and have more success keeping their numbers up. In New York, for instance, some 170,000 people selected plans by December 1, compared to 150,000 last year. Nearly 98,000 Minnesota residents signed up for coverage in the first two weeks of November, compared to 91,600 last year. But in California, which has a very robust marketing campaign, fewer new folks selected plans through November. While roughly 1.2 million enrollees have been renewed for 2019, a similar figure to last year, the number of new consumers dropped about 11% to 90,500. Covered California Executive Director Peter Lee attributes the decline to a delay in the start of the marketing campaign until after Election Day, the elimination of the penalty for not having coverage and less media attention on Obamacare. Californians have until January 15 to sign up for policies.",

            "article_content": "House Democrats overwhelmingly picked Nancy Pelosi to be their nominee for House speaker on Wednesday, though she\u2019ll need to win over more than a dozen no votes in order to win with 218 members\u2019 support in the full floor vote in January. Pelosi was nominated as speaker by House Democrats in a closed door meeting by a 203-32 vote, according to attendees in the room. Three ballots were blank. One member was absent. To be elected House speaker requires support from a majority of all members who are present and voting, a threshold that could be as high as 218 votes, though Pelosi could win with fewer as several previous House speakers have done, if members vote present or decline to participate. Inside Pelosi's furious push to win back the speakership A small, but vocal, faction of Democrats have been attempting to derail Pelosi\u2019s run for speaker, but she has succeeded in winning over a number of critics in recent days and was expected to easily win the nomination since it required only a majority of House Democrats. The make-or-break moment for Pelosi isn\u2019t expected to come until January, when the full House holds a final floor vote to elect the speaker. In 2016, Pelosi lost 63 votes in the House Democratic Caucus when she ran for Democratic leader against Tim Ryan. Ultimately, however, just four voted against her on the floor in 2017. Pelosi and her allies have been working to make deals with some of her critics and win over detractors, and have several more weeks to continue doing so to shore up support before the January vote. As the leader of House Democrats, Pelosi has a variety of ways she can attempt to flip Democrats. To name just a few: She can make promises to prioritize legislative priorities in the new Congress. She can help members secure coveted positions on powerful committees. She can broker connections with prominent Democrats or offer to assist with fundraising efforts. House Democrats also held elections on Wednesday for positions lower in the leadership hierarchy. Rep. Steny Hoyer, the current minority whip, was elected majority leader in the new Congress, winning the vote by acclamation, meaning he won unanimously and they didn\u2019t do a roll call. Rep. James Clyburn, the current assistant Democratic Leader, won the spot of majority whip. He also won by acclamation. Hoyer and Clyburn, are already the current respective No. 2 and No 3. House Democrats, and will maintain their same rank in the new Democrat-led Congress, keeping in place a Democratic leadership team that has been in power for years. Both ran unopposed. New Mexico Rep. Ben Ray Luj\u00e1n, who currently serves as chair of the House Democratic campaign arm, was elected to serve in the role of assistant Democratic leader in the new Congress. He ran unopposed. The first election to be decided of the day was for the position of Democratic caucus chair. Rep. Hakeem Jeffries of New York was elected to the post, making him the No. 5-ranked Democrat next Congress. The vote was close, 123-113. He defeated Rep. Barbara Lee, who would have been the first African-American woman in Democratic leadership. Nancy Pelosi: 'I want women to see that you do not get pushed around' At 48, Jeffries is relatively young compared to the rest of the caucus and a rising star in the Democratic Party. Winning the position of caucus chair will elevate him further in the party\u2019s hierarchy and give him an opportunity to wield more power and influence. With Rep. Jim Clyburn\u2019s expected ascent to the majority whip position, Jeffries\u2019 win means that two of the top five leadership positions in the Democratic caucus will be held by African-American members. Lee, who is 72, said on Wednesday that she felt there were \u201cinstitutional barriers\u201d in her way. \u201cYou feel some disappointment only with the institutional barriers that I recognized that were out there during this campaign. I\u2019m really disappointed in that, knowing this was an uphill battle,\u201d she said. Asked if she felt ageism and sexism were at place, Lee said yes. \u201cYou heard and saw what took place, so absolutely, I think that is the case,\u201d she said. \u201cWe still have many glass ceilings to break,\u201d she added. Speaking to reporters after winning his election, Jeffries said he wanted to thank Lee \u201cfor her tremendous service to this nation\u201d and characterized the race very differently: \u201cFrom the very beginning through the very end, this was a friendly contest of ideas.\u201d The elections are currently ongoing at the Capitol and will continue throughout the day. Inside the room where Democrats are voting, Rep. Joe Crowley, the outgoing caucus chair who lost his primary to incoming freshman lawmaker Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in an upset, sang an Irish ballad to the House Democratic Caucus, two members present told CNN. The caucus gave him a standing ovation. Late Wednesday, Democrats also picked their next vice chair of the Democratic caucus: Rep. Katherine Clark of Massachusetts, who defeated Rep. Pete Aguilar of California. After Wednesday\u2019s elections, Thursday will feature a vote for who will serve as the next chair of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, the House campaign arm for Democrats. Unlike many of the other races, the DCCC chair election features a crowded field. Reps. Denny Heck of Washington, Cheri Bustos of Illinois, Suzan DelBene of Washington and Sean Patrick Maloney of New York are all running for the post. On Tuesday, Maloney asked for a delay in the DCCC chair election after being \u201chospitalized Monday with an urgent but temporary medical condition\u201d stemming from \u201ca persistent bacterial infection that spread to a number of his internal organs,\u201d according to a statement from his office. The statement said that Maloney would withdraw as a candidate if there is not a delay in the election. It\u2019s not yet clear if the election will be delayed. On Wednesday, the Democratic members of a group known as the problem solvers caucus put out a statement saying that they had reached an agreement with Pelosi that would \u201chelp break the gridlock\u201d in Congress. Nine of the House Democrats who are members of the caucus had previously said they would not vote for Pelosi unless she endorsed their proposed changes to House rules. In another sign that Pelosi\u2019s bid could be gaining momentum, Rep. Stephen Lynch, one of the Democrats who previously signed a letter calling for new leadership, walked out of the caucus meeting on Wednesday side-by-side with Nancy Pelosi as cameras flashed all around them. Speaking to reporters afterward, Lynch said he told Pelosi that he can be persuaded to support her and that they\u2019re going to have a conversation later Wednesday. He didn\u2019t rule out the idea that he could possibly vote for Pelosi as soon as today. \u201cI\u2019m persuadable,\u201d he said. But it was also clear on Wednesday that Pelosi has not eliminated the opposition to her becoming speaker. Rep. Kathleen Rice, a Pelosi critic, said in a statement that she and others \u201cmet with Leader Pelosi and tried to engage her in a reasonable conversation about leadership transition,\u201d on Wednesday. But, Rice said, \u201cUnfortunately, our concerns were dismissed outright,\u201d adding, \u201cWe remain united behind our goal of new leadership and intend to vote against Leader Pelosi in Caucus and on the Floor of the House.\u201d A source told CNN that Rice along with Pelosi critics, Reps. Seth Moulton and Tim Ryan were present at the meeting, which took place in Pelosi\u2019s office. Moulton later released a statement on the meeting as well. \u201cI am disappointed to report that no agreement was reached in this initial meeting,\u201d he said, but added, \u201cWe are hopeful Leader Pelosi will invite us back to the table to plan for the future success of the Democratic Party.\u201d Earlier this month, Pelosi won the support of Rep. Marcia Fudge of Ohio, who had previously criticized her and publicly toyed with the idea of challenging her. At nearly the same time that Fudge announced she would vote for Pelosi for speaker, Pelosi announced that she will make Fudge the chair of an elections subcomittee in the new Congress. In another example of Pelosi\u2019s powers of persuasion at work, Rep. Brian Higgins of New York came out in support of her Speakers\u2019 bid last week despite previously signing onto a letter calling for new leadership. When Higgins reversed course, he told CNN that he got Pelosi to commit to prioritizing a $1 trillion infrastructure bill and a measure to allow people 50 and older to buy into Medicare. Pelosi does still face some opposition within her caucus, however, though she and her allies continue to express confidence that she will ultimately win. Earlier in the week, Pelosi detractors added another rebel to their ranks when Gil Cisneros, a Democrat who recently won a race in a conservative district in California, announced he would sign the letter pledging not to support her on the floor.",

            "article_content": "The calls from wealthy Democratic donors, influential party bosses and long-time supporters alike are coming in this week to Rep. Kathleen Rice, the New York Democrat who\u2019s trying to mount a coup against Nancy Pelosi. And they all carry a similar message: Get behind Nancy Pelosi. Nancy Pelosi: 'I want women to see that you do not get pushed around' Rice, who\u2019s helping to lead a faction of roughly 18 Democrats who say they won\u2019t support Pelosi, is getting a small taste of the furious onslaught waged by Pelosi and her allies to lock down support, limit defections and ensure that she will once again reclaim the speaker\u2019s gavel she first wielded more than a decade ago. The growing pushback on her staunchest foes is the latest sign of how Pelosi is using power she\u2019s amassed through her more than three decades on Capitol Hill to once again reclaim her perch atop the House. On Wednesday, the House Democratic Caucus voted 203-32 at a closed-door meeting to nominate Pelosi as their nominee to be House speaker. While it was an overwhelming majority, she will need to peel off more than a dozen no votes over the next five weeks if she wants to win with 218 supporters on the full floor vote in January, though depending on who votes and how that threshold for victory could be lower. Even before the vote, anger was mounting at the anti-Pelosi faction, something bound to intensify after Wednesday if the rebels don\u2019t fall in line once Pelosi is formally nominated as her party\u2019s choice to be speaker next Congress. \u201cShe\u2019ll be our speaker,\u201d said Rep. John Garamendi of California. \u201cEnd of discussion.\u201d Despite lacking the votes so far to win a floor vote among the entire House, Pelosi allies have reason to be confident. Roughly 45 surrogates made calls on her behalf. Democratic stalwarts like Al Gore and John Kerry have urged members to fall in line. And she\u2019s made many offers they can\u2019t refuse \u2013 from perches on key committees to promises to move on legislation they\u2019ve supported to simply listening to the concerns of her members. For example, Rep.-elect Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts told CNN she decided to support Pelosi after being promised a position on the gun violence task force. \u201cWhat I care about is that we are leading on those issues that are consequential to the American people,\u201d Pressley said. \u201cAnd the issue that was a priority to me is that we would be moving early in the session on a robust gun bill. And I got that commitment. I\u2019ve been appointed to the gun violence task force.\u201d Rep.-elect Colin Allred from Texas has still not announced how he will vote on Pelosi, but told CNN that it comes down to what Pelosi can offer him, though he declined to give specifics. The confidence also comes as the anti-Pelosi faction have struggled to swiftly bring down the California Democrat. The critics so far don\u2019t have a candidate who will run against her; Rep. Marcia Fudge, originally part of the group, backed down after Pelosi rewarded her with a spot running a subcommittee. One member, Rep. Brian Higgins of New York, reversed course and said he\u2019d support her after winning promises \u2013 over the course of three days of phone calls \u2013 to bring up a bill to expand Medicare eligibility and another to spend $1 trillion on infrastructure projects. And others who have held out have found themselves on the phone repeatedly with Pelosi ahead of Wednesday\u2019s caucus vote. \u201cI\u2019ve voted for you, and I\u2019ve voted against you,\u201d Rep. Jim Costa of California said he told Pelosi in recent days. \u201cAnd I\u2019d like to support you. I\u2019d like to.\u201d Others signaled a likelihood to support Pelosi because there\u2019s no one else who has stepped up. \u201cI was hoping that someone else would stand up and say, \u2018Listen, I think I have what it takes to do this as well,\u2019\u201d said Rep.-elect Jahana Hayes of Connecticut, who vowed to oppose Pelosi during the campaign but is now supporting her. \u201cAnd I didn\u2019t see that.\u201d For their part, aides and members in the anti-Pelosi group argue the arm-twisting won\u2019t deter the group\u2019s ultimate goal of blocking Pelosi from getting the votes she needs on the House floor in January. Rice argued such \u201cbackroom deals represent the establishment-based transactional politics that the American people hate and patently rejected on Election Day.\u201d \u201cThese tactics also stifle fair and open leadership elections within our caucus and perpetuate the leadership stagnation that has plagued our party for over a decade,\u201d she added. In private conversations over the last several days, Pelosi critics have not been pleased by recent developments, questioning their decision to write a letter that said they were \u201ccommitted\u201d to voting for new leadership, language that allowed some members to wiggle out of their promises. Now, they believe they can still derail her if she can\u2019t get the votes on the floor, something they hope could convince a dark horse candidate to run. Pelosi\u2019s nomination on Wednesday is more of a formality, they said. \u201cLeader Pelosi will likely win the majority of votes,\u201d Rice said Tuesday. \u201cThe only number that really matters is 218, and after today it will become clear that she does not have the votes.\u201d Rep. Tim Ryan, who ran against Pelosi for Democratic leader and lost after the 2016 elections, suggested Tuesday night that a challenger might emerge during the caucus vote Wednesday. \u201cWe\u2019re going to find out tomorrow,\u201d Ryan said when asked if he believed the anti-Pelosi effort has been going well. The tension highlights an intra-party divide over who should hold the reins as House Democrats take back the majority for the first time since they lost it eight years ago. On one side is the vast majority of the Democratic caucus that\u2019s lining up behind Pelosi. On the other side is a tiny faction of members who argue Pelosi\u2019s been No. 1 for too long, and it\u2019s time for change. In between are a few dozen Democrats who aren\u2019t clearly saying how they plan to vote. Pelosi only needed a majority of the Democratic caucus on Wednesday to win the nomination, but in January she\u2019ll need a majority of the full House \u2013 traditionally 218 votes. A floor fight would lead to \u201cmutually assured destruction\u201d for Democrats on the first day of the new Congress, warned Illinois Democratic Rep. Raja Krishnamoorthi. \u201cA floor fight while the world is watching would make this the most highly rated swearing in for the wrong reasons,\u201d Krishnamoorthi told CNN. \u201cAnd I think it would lead to us losing the majority potentially on the first vote of a new Congress.\u201d Democrats could have as many as 235 seats in the next Congress, meaning Pelosi can afford to lose only 17 Democrats, if all members vote for a specific candidate. She could win with fewer than 218 votes under certain scenarios. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem like there\u2019s an alternative as part of their strategy,\u201d said Rep. Cheri Bustos, an Illinois Democrat, who acknowledged that some Pelosi critics reached out to her to urge her to consider running for speaker. Meanwhile on Tuesday, a separate group of six Democrats part of the so-called Problem Solvers Caucus, met for 90 minutes with a top Pelosi confidante, Rep. Jim McGovern of Massachusetts, to try to cut a deal over several rules changes. The group\u2019s proposals would make it easier for rank-and-file members to get bipartisan bills considered by the leadership. Nine Democrats from that group had threatened to withhold their votes until Pelosi backed their calls for changes, but several say they are closer to endorsing her. \u201cWe\u2019re that close,\u201d said Rep. Tom Suozzi, a Democrat of New York, showing an inch between his thumb and index finger. \u201cIt\u2019s looking good.\u201d On Wednesday, the problem solvers Democrats put out a statement saying that they had reached an agreement with Pelosi that would \u201chelp break the gridlock\u201d in Congress. While the separate anti-Pelosi group is still determined to keep pushing for leadership changes, they\u2019re also signaling openness to possible negotiations with Pelosi \u2013 with the aim of establishing a clear succession plan at some point within the next two years of her term. Negotiations, however, haven\u2019t begun, and there\u2019s no clear sign yet the Pelosi would engage with the rebels on that front. In private conversations with Democratic members, Pelosi has not said when she might step aside or who she favors to replace her. Asked if the Pelosi critics should drop their efforts if they lose the Wednesday vote, as expected, Rep. Ted Lieu said: \u201cMy preference is they should.\u201d One of the most vocal rebels, Rep. Seth Moulton, alluded to that openness of broader talks with Pelosi earlier this week. Given his fraught relationship with Pelosi, it\u2019s unlikely the Massachusetts Democrat would be at the forefront of any talks. Rather, there are a few in the group who are still in good standing with the Democratic leader, like Rep. Ed Perlmutter, who some feel could potentially emerge as a lead negotiator if Pelosi agreed to talk. Pelosi has met with many of her critics, including incoming freshmen Democrats like Max Rose of New York, but she has not spoken to foes like Democrat Kurt Schrader of Oregon. \u201cHas she talked to me, Kurt Schrader? No,\u201d he said. \u201cIt should concern her \u2013 not me.\u201d This story has been updated to include Wednesday\u2019s developments.",

            "article_content": "Republican congressional candidates across the country are approaching President Donald Trump in markedly different ways. And nowhere is that clearer than in upstate New York. Claudia Tenney in New York\u2019s 22nd Congressional District and John Faso in the neighboring 19th District have taken markedly different approaches to the omnipresent President, despite both being two vulnerable Republican incumbents running in a year where Democrats are eager to deliver a powerful rebuke to Trump. Though the President won both districts in 2016, top Republican operatives believe the races are similar: Neither Republican is particularly well-liked at home, meaning Trump\u2019s popularity and the image of the Republican Party will be key to whether Republicans hold onto the districts. But Tenney, a bombastic, conservative congresswoman known for her fiery rhetoric and propensity to often make head-scratching comments, has fully embraced Trump and made that strategy central to her campaign against Anthony Brindisi, an assemblyman from Utica. The district is more conservative than her neighbor \u2013 Trump won the 22nd by 16 percentage points in 2016 \u2013 and Tenney\u2019s rhetoric reflects those values. In contrast, Faso, a more mild-mannered Republican, has eschewed some of Trumpism, voting against his tax plan and dismissing the President\u2019s role in his re-election bid. Despite that, he still has the President\u2019s support, as Trump tweeted an endorsement for Faso on Saturday. But that has not kept one of the President\u2019s key political tactics \u2013 the use of race \u2013 out of Faso\u2019s contest against Antonio Delgado, an African-American Harvard law graduate and Rhodes Scholar. CNN Key Races: Six races move toward Democrats as battle for control of the House enters the home stretch Ads from the Congressional Leadership Fund and the National Republican Congressional Committee have focused on Delgado\u2019s brief career as rapper AD the Voice, labeling him derisively as \u201cbig city rapper Antonio Delgado,\u201d questioning some of the lyrics in his songs and suggesting he would be more fit running in places like New York City or Los Angeles. The ads are dripping in race-based politics and use white voters to suggest Delgado doesn\u2019t understand the predominately white district. Faso has played coy with the ads, in part because they provide Republicans with a powerful way to question Delgado\u2019s ties to a district he moved to shortly before announcing his bid for Congress. In the span of five minutes on Friday, Faso told reporters here at the quaint Inn at Leeds that he didn\u2019t like a lot of the ads and distanced himself from them \u2013 \u201cThese are not my ads,\u201d he said twice \u2013 while also endorsing the substance of the attacks. \u201cThe fact is that my opponent has never owned up to his words and he just moved into the district,\u201d Faso said. \u201cHis words matter and because he has no record in our district \u2026 it is natural that people will ask, \u2018do these words reflect your views?\u2019\u201d Each race will be closely watched on Tuesday, both as a sign of which approach to Trump fared better and whether Democrats, aiming to make inroads in areas that were wooed by Trump, will be able to crack the red wall the President created. Republicans have been sounding alarm bells in each race: If Democrats are able to win either or both races, they said, it\u2019s almost a certainty that Democrats will control the House next year. \u201cIf she loses this race,\u201d said Jim Brock, a Tenney friend and Republican operative, \u201cyou can just say goodbye to Republicans controlling Congress.\u201d Delgado, standing before an almost entirely white crowd at St. James\u2019 Episcopal Church in Hyde Park on Friday, addressed something that has been ubiquitous on television: His rap career. \u201cI know you have heard of one of my careers,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause you can\u2019t get away from it.\u201d It got a laugh from a friendly crowd and the Democrat moved onto his platform, namely health care, where he wants to move towards Medicare for all, and campaign finance reform, where he rejects corporate PAC money. No one at the event asked him about the ads. Down the road, though, was a distinctly different speech to an almost entirely white audience. \u201cWe sure don\u2019t need a new import,\u201d Faso told the Republican audience at an event featuring Louisiana Rep. Steve Scalise, \u201cto represent us in Washington, DC.\u201d The divide makes something clear about the race to represent this district: Republicans are seeking to, in the words of Democrats, \u201cotherize\u201d Delgado, a candidate who was born and raised nearby in Schenectady, moved away to pursue a career but then moved back with his wife and kids to run for Congress. Delgado dismisses the attacks as not reflective of the people in the district. Early vote swamps 2014 levels as first-timers make up notable portion of ballots \u201cThey (Republicans) have a low opinion of people in the district that they are assuming the people in this district could be swayed by hateful divisive approaches to campaigning,\u201d he said in an interview. \u201cIt would be good if he (Faso) would denounce them. It would have sent the right signal. To me, it would have meant to be a leader.\u201d But the ads have forced Democrats and Republicans alike to question why top GOP operatives believe attacks like those would work in their pastoral towns and hamlets. Sitting in the church on Friday, it didn\u2019t take Katherine Baldwin long to answer that question. \u201cI mean, just look around,\u201d she said, noting the nearly all white audience. \u201cIn our country and around the world, people are scared of what is other and different to them. There is not a lot of diversity in this district and as a white woman, I see that. I see that here, I see that at any event I have gone to.\u201d Democratic operatives believe the ads have backfired. The attacks have enraged Democrats and boosted Delgado\u2019s fundraising \u2013 allowing him to raise an astonishing $3.8 million in the third quarter of 2018 alone. And polls show the race deadlocked. But Republicans have stuck with the strategy for months, hoping it will make people question Delgado\u2019s roots. At Faso\u2019s event, however, it wasn\u2019t clear that even strong Republican voters were that motivated by the ads. Some were even uncomfortable with them, they said. Lou Barbaria, a 70-year-old retired law enforcement officer from Cairo, said he was voting for Faso because he believed Delgado \u201cwould go against a lot of things I want.\u201d It has nothing to do, he said, with rap. \u201cWhatever, I was in a band when I was young,\u201d Barbaria said with a laugh. \u201cI mean, I wasn\u2019t in a rap band, but I did street corner doo-wop stuff. But I am sure there are things that I said on stage that might have offended.\u201d Not everyone agreed with Barbaria. Tom Andreassen, a 71-year-old Vietnam veteran from Leeds, said he didn\u2019t like \u201cwhat Delgado has done with his rap music.\u201d The Forecast: Election night could go into overtime \u201cA leopard may change its colors,\u201d Andreassen said when asked if he thinks Delgado has changed, \u201cbut it\u2019s not going change its spots.\u201d But Andreassen\u2019s view was unique. More often, voters dismissed the rap attacks and instead knocked Delgado\u2019s views on health care or taxes. Gail Kargle, a 74-year old from Cairo, made this clear: \u201cI like Delgado. I like his presentation. But I don\u2019t like what he stands for. But I have no problem with his rap. I have no problem with any of that.\u201d When asked if she likes rap at all, Kargle said no, but then took a long pause. \u201cI guess I do like Pitbull,\u201d she said with surprise. \u201cI\u2019m 74 years old and I like him!\u201d Voters around Binghamton and Utica, the two population centers in Tenney\u2019s congressional district, could be forgiven for having a bit of whiplash. Over the last decade, voters have bounced from one party to the next in presidential and congressional elections, regularly see-sawing between parties. In 2008, the area backed Barack Obama. Four years later, Republican Mitt Romney won the district by one percentage point. But the real eye-opener happened in 2016, when Donald Trump shellacked Hillary Clinton by 16 percentage points. For Brindisi, the moderate state assembly member with deep ties in Utica, Trump\u2019s success in the area does not conflict with his candidacy as a Democrat. Instead of focusing on the President, Brindisi has run on hyper-local issues, including airing ads against the local cable company, and tries to avoid knocking the President. \u201cMost people in this district are fed up with Washington,\u201d the Democrat said. \u201cThey are looking for someone who is going to represent the interests of the people back home.\u201d That statement is true for many congressional districts. But Brindisi is happy to take that one step further, by citing Trump\u2019s 2016 attacks against Clinton to ding Tenney. Young voters usually sit out the midterms. There are signs 2018 could be different. \u201cI think many of the things he campaigned for when he was running in 2016, when he was running against Hillary Clinton, I could say the same things about Claudia Tenney,\u201d Brindisi said in his Binghamton campaign office. \u201cTrump would always say during the 2016 election there was a reason why the Wall Street banks and the hedge fund managers and the big financial institutions are supporting my opponent because they know the system will continue to be rigged in their favor if she is elected. I could say the same thing about Claudia Tenney.\u201d That may be where Tenney\u2019s similarities with Clinton end, because her rhetoric is pure Trump. Earlier this year, she suggested that Democrats are more prone to carrying out mass shootings, she has questioned farmers who are worried about the trade war, and when a story was published about Housing and Urban Development Secretary Ben Carson buying a $31,000 dining room set for his office, Tenney blamed the \u201cdeep state.\u201d Brock, a close friend who grew up with Tenney, said he believes it \u201cdoesn\u2019t hurt\u201d the congresswoman to be rhetorically in line with Trump. But what could hurt, voters said, was being viewed as not being the \u201cchange candidate\u201d in a district that has clearly preferred exactly that. \u201cIt is because he\u2019s never ran (for Congress) before, because he is new,\u201d Bridget Kane, a Democratic candidate for a local race around Binghamton, said to describe Brindisi\u2019s appeal. \u201cThey were desperate for change\u201d in 2016, she added, and they are just as desperate now. Election Day weather could be nasty in several key states Polls have shown Brindisi and Tenney, who declined repeated requests for an interview for this story, in a nearly deadlocked race, a fact that has beget considerable outside spending in the contest. According to a study by the Wesleyan Media Project, more than 12,000 commercials aired in the district between mid-September and mid-October \u2013 the most of any district in the country at the time. In order to win, Brindisi is clear-eyed about the fact he needs to win over Republican voters, and Tenney has been helpful on that front by turning off local Republicans like Yusuf Harper, a retired physician who runs an organic farm in Norwich, New York. Brindisi is the first Democrat Harder has ever volunteered for, he said, and, although there are issues that worry him about the left-leaning party, he can\u2019t bring himself to back Tenney. \u201cYes, he is a Democrat and there is some risk there,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the alternative is just not good.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Endangered Republican candidates are responding to health care-focused campaign attacks with falsehoods and obfuscations \u2013 with President Donald Trump leading the charge. After two years of trying to repeal Obamacare outright, the President and some GOP candidates are suddenly claiming they support the Affordable Care Act\u2019s protections for those with pre-existing conditions \u2013 even though they voted for repeal bills that would weaken them, or are suing to eliminate Obamacare altogether. Other Republicans are linking their Democratic opponents to Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders\u2019 \u201cMedicare for all\u201d single-payer health insurance plan \u2013 a way to invoke socialism to scare voters, even when the Democrats in those races have either opposed Sanders\u2019 plan or said it was infeasible. The reason for the reversal is clear: Parts of Obamacare have turned out to be really popular, and Democrats have wielded Republican opposition to the law and other efforts to cut entitlement spending ruthlessly in campaigns for the House, the Senate and governor\u2019s offices. \u201cObamacare was unpopular because it was disruptive,\u201d said former Rep. Tom Davis, a former chairman of the House GOP\u2019s campaign arm. Since the 2016 election, though, \u201cthe Republicans were the disruptive group. At this point, even getting into that mess, whoever is disruptive pays a price at the polls.\u201d Davis said Republicans can\u2019t afford to let attacks over pre-existing conditions go unanswered. \u201cI don\u2019t think you want to let this charge float out there, because health care is the one bill that is hurting them this year,\u201d he said. The real reason Trump is talking about pre-existing conditions But Republicans\u2019 tactical ducking and, at times, outright lies over their roles in efforts to unravel the current system either through legislation or in the courts has left some Democratic candidates exasperated \u2013 and led to a new wave of Democratic attacks over the GOP\u2019s inconsistencies. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the things that frustrates voters so much \u2013 that they can\u2019t rely on anything they\u2019re hearing,\u201d Democratic congressional candidate Lizzie Pannill Fletcher said during in a debate Sunday night. Fletcher, who was seen as a moderate during her primary match-up against Laura Moser, is challenging Republican Rep. John Culberson for a Houston-area House seat. In the debate, she complained that Culberson has cast her as a single-payer proponent in television ads and mailers even after her opposition to it made her politically vulnerable during the primary. \u201cAnd yet somehow, you, congressman, have authorized ads on TV saying the exact opposite of what I said,\u201d Fletcher said. Similar scenes are playing out across the nation, as Democratic candidates who have opposed or expressed major reservations about \u201cMedicare for all\u201d are being cast as ardent supporters of the progressive idea. In Michigan, Gretchen Whitmer, the front-runner in the governor\u2019s race, survived a Democratic primary in which she was targeted by progressives for opposing a state-level \u201cMedicare for all\u201d-style system. But earlier this month, the Republican Governors Association in a TV ad accused Whitmer of pursing \u201ca radical government takeover of your health care\u201d that would double taxes and under which \u201cyour employer-priced insurance plan would be illegal.\u201d The GOP efforts to shift the focus to \u201cMedicare for all\u201d come as the party\u2019s candidates frantically attempt to repel attacks over the health care issue that is at the forefront of nearly every campaign across the nation: their records on coverage for those with pre-existing conditions. Obamacare was built on the principle that coverage for sick people would be made affordable by putting healthy people in the same insurance pools \u2013 and requiring everyone to buy that insurance. Republicans spent most of Obama\u2019s presidency and the first year of Trump\u2019s presidency attempting to repeal Obama\u2019s health care law. While they offered partial replacements designed to make sure people with pre-existing conditions maintained access to coverage, nonpartisan experts said the alternatives would have made that coverage much more expensive. It\u2019s a fundamental policy challenge that daunted GOP repeal efforts: Coverage for pre-existing conditions is among the reasons health insurance costs have increased; some of the main ways to lower those costs are to allow plans to discriminate against the sick and offer lesser coverage or to spend more tax dollars subsidizing premiums or shielding insurers from high-cost patients. Democrats and Republicans get personal about health care on campaign trail The backlash against GOP Obamacare repeal efforts began a groundswell of momentum for Democrats heading into the midterms. National polls have shown health care is the top issue on many voters\u2019 minds, and Democrats have focused most of their campaigns\u2019 television ads on health care \u2013 largely alleging that their Republican foes have tried to undercut protections for those with pre-existing conditions. Trump has rushed to Republicans\u2019 defense on pre-existing conditions in recent days. He penned a USA Today op-ed claiming to have \u201ckept that promise\u201d to protect coverage for those with pre-existing conditions. He tweeted last week he is in \u201ctotal support\u201d of maintaining those protections. \u201cRepublicans will always protect people with pre-existing conditions,\u201d he said at a rally Saturday in Nevada. And on Wednesday, he tweeted that Republicans will \u201ctotally protect\u201d people with pre-existing conditions, while Democrats will not. What Trump isn\u2019t saying: His own Justice Department is fighting in court to strike down Obamacare\u2019s protections for those with pre-existing conditions. The department is arguing that these core tenets of Obamacare should be invalidated because Congress eliminated the individual mandate penalty. The case is part of a suit brought by 20 Republican state attorneys general and governors looking to strike down the law. Some of those attorneys general are on the ballot this year, including Josh Hawley, the Republican challenging Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill in Missouri who has aired TV ads in which he says he and his wife learned their oldest son has a \u201crare chronic disease\u201d this year, and that he supports \u201cforcing insurance companies to cover all pre-existing conditions.\u201d Other Republicans have followed Hawley\u2019s lead and told personal stories. During their debate last week, Nevada Rep. Jacky Rosen, the Democrat challenging Republican Sen. Dean Heller, dared the incumbent to look into the camera and tell the family of a child with a heart defect \u201cthe truth about why you broke your promise and why you support slashing protections for pre-existing conditions.\u201d Heller rejected the charge and said, \u201cI wrote a replacement bill for the Republican Party. I know exactly what\u2019s in that bill and what\u2019s in that bill includes pre-existing conditions.\u201d However, the bill Heller was referring to \u2013 authored by a group that included GOP Sens. Bill Cassidy, Lindsey Graham, Ron Johnson and Heller \u2013 actually weakened Obamacare\u2019s protections for those with pre-existing conditions. Had that legislation become law, states could have opted to once again allow carriers to base premiums on a person\u2019s medical history and to sell skimpier policies that don\u2019t cover Obamacare\u2019s 10 essential health benefits. Those with pre-existing conditions could have found themselves unable to afford insurance or able to only buy bare bones policies that wouldn\u2019t have covered all the treatments they need. As Rosen pressed him on the issue, Heller insisted that health concerns in his own family meant he could be trusted despite the plain facts of his record. \u201cI have two grandchildren with pre-existing conditions,\u201d he said. \u201cI think it\u2019s ridiculous, congresswoman, that you think that I wouldn\u2019t be there for the health and safety of my own grandchildren.\u201d Republican House incumbents and Senate candidates have often pointed to a failed Obamacare repeal effort last year as evidence that they would maintain protections for those with pre-existing conditions. However, independent analyst after analyst has concluded that the House-passed repeal bill actually would have weakened Obamacare\u2019s protections. It would have allowed states to let insurers charge higher premiums to those with pre-existing conditions if they let their coverage lapse and if the state set up a high-risk program. It also would have let states apply for waivers to sell plans that don\u2019t cover all of Obamacare\u2019s mandated health benefits, such as maternity, mental health and prescription drugs. The bill included $138 billion to create a stability fund to help lower consumers\u2019 and insurers\u2019 costs, including $8 billion over five years to support those with costly medical conditions, but experts said it was nowhere near enough. The result in some states, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office said at the time, would be a pre-Obamacare health care landscape in which \u201cpeople with high expected medical costs were often unable to obtain coverage.\u201d Health care takes center stage in midterms fight -- and Republicans are on the defensive \u201cAll the parts matter,\u201d said Karen Pollitz, a senior fellow at the Kaiser Family Foundation. \u201cIf you had a dam that blocked an entire river and then you took that out and then you just put back a couple of rocks, with gaps in between, it wouldn\u2019t be the same.\u201d Still, Republicans have insisted industry and government experts are all somehow mistaken \u2013 and that nonpartisan analyses of the GOP\u2019s bill are simply wrong. In Arizona, Rep. Martha McSally, the Republican running against Democratic Rep. Kyrsten Sinema for the Senate, on Wednesday launched a new TV ad claiming she was \u201cleading the fight\u201d to \u201cforce insurance companies to cover pre-existing conditions.\u201d The ad ignores the reality that Obamacare already forced insurers to cover those with pre-existing conditions. Democrats support keeping those protections in place; only Republicans have fought to change the law. To explain her claims, McSally has pointed to the failed House GOP-passed bill \u2013 including the $8 billion, which was added through an amendment McSally cosponsored. In an email, McSally spokeswoman Torunn Sinclair acknowledged that analysts have concluded $8 billion wasn\u2019t enough, but said \u201cthese same estimates also don\u2019t account for potential savings from reducing health care costs by allowing new and innovative new ways to provide health coverage.\u201d In Phoenix, Sinema told reporters that McSally\u2019s new ad \u201ctries to pretend she supports protecting people with pre-existing conditions. But you can\u2019t run from your voting record in Arizona.\u201d",

            "article_content": "President Donald Trump issued a warning to fellow Republicans to support coverage of pre-existing conditions with less than 20 days until the midterm elections. \u201cAll Republicans support people with pre-existing conditions, and if they don\u2019t, they will after I speak to them. I am in total support. Also, Democrats will destroy your Medicare, and I will keep it healthy and well!\u201d he tweeted Thursday afternoon after departing the White House for a campaign swing out West. The tweet is in line with a familiar refrain from Trump\u2019s recent campaign rallies and even dating back to his debates during the Republican primary. However, it\u2019s not consistent with his administration\u2019s actions and policies. Earlier this month, a Democratic measure aimed at eliminating short-term health care plans that don\u2019t have to cover pre-existing conditions failed in the Senate. Maine Sen. Susan Collins was the sole Republican to vote for the measure. The resolution was aimed at rebuffing a Trump executive order unveiled in August that made it easier to buy these plans. Short-term health care plans don\u2019t have to adhere to the Affordable Care Act\u2019s regulations that protect people with pre-existing conditions. These plans can deny coverage or charge higher premiums to Americans based on their medical histories. And they don\u2019t have to provide comprehensive coverage. The Trump administration made it easier to buy these plans \u2013 allowing people to buy coverage for just under a year, versus the 90-day limit imposed by the Obama administration. The administration also broadened the availability of plans that small businesses can buy that don\u2019t have to adhere to all of Obamacare\u2019s protections. Additionally, the administration sought to gut two core provisions of the Affordable Care Act that guarantee protections for those with pre-existing conditions in June. The White House supported several Obamacare repeal bills, including one in the House of Representatives that advocates argued weakened coverage of pre-existing conditions. Several moderate Republicans in the House of Representatives even cited a lack of protections for people with pre-existing conditions as a reason they voted \u201cno.\u201d And the White House-endorsed \u201cskinny repeal\u201d of the Affordable Care Act that failed in the Senate after Sen. John McCain\u2019s no vote in July 2017 \u2013 something Trump frequently lambasts on the campaign trail \u2013 would have waived regulations that would have likely seen higher premiums for those with pre-existing conditions. Health care has become a rallying cry for Democrats leading up to election day, and many Democrats were quick to pounce on Trump\u2019s tweet. \u201cYour ACA repeal would\u2019ve left ppl w/ pre-existing conditions to fend for themselves. Your tax bill exploded the deficit so much Mitch is hoping to use it as an excuse to cut Medicare. Your challenges with the truth continue. Bull Trump for short,\u201d Virginia Democrat Rep. Gerry Connolly tweeted. And Democratic Minority Leader Sen. Chuck Schumer wrote, \u201cMr. President: Look in the mirror, and you\u2019ll see the person you need to speak with. Pull back your lawsuit fighting to undo protections for pre-existing conditions.\u201d Massachusetts Rep. Joe Kennedy posted a photo of Trump in the White House Rose Garden after House Republicans passed a bill to repeal and replace Obamacare. This is you and all your friends laughing hysterically about gutting preexisting conditions a year ago. You thought we forgot? pic.twitter.com/YYREjXaGzN \u201cThis is you and all your friends laughing hysterically about gutting preexisting conditions a year ago. You thought we forgot?\u201d he wrote.

            "article_content": "As of Monday, Democrats and their allies are still dominating most of the campaign airwaves in key House races across the country. Newly released television ad data shows just how large the disparity is in certain places, as both sides muster their resources in the final weeks. The ad records, from Kantar Media/CMAG, covers all TV ads aired the week of October 9-15. When it came to the 61 most competitive midterm races \u2013 designated by CNN as Tossup, Lean Republican or Lean Democratic \u2013 the Democratic ad dominance was pronounced. Overall, Democrats were on the air in every such district during the week, and in most cases more active. Republicans and their allies sat out nine of the races, with no on-air presence at all, though they ran ads in the rest, and in several districts they ran more ads than Democrats. If we examine these most competitive districts and look at where both parties actively aired ads against each other during the week, there were 52 such races. Democrats ran more ads in 43 of them. In terms of where each party and the super PACs supporting them were most prolific on the air during the newly released October week, Democrats by far most heavily targeted New Mexico\u2019s 2nd District, which CNN rates as \u201cLean Republican,\u201d and where their candidate Xochitl Torres Small is taking on Republican state representative Yvette Herrell. Democrats ran about 2,300 ads over the course of the week. Close on its heels for Democratic activity were the New York 22nd and Maine 2nd, both of which are rated as Toss Ups and where about 1,800 ads aired in each. For Republicans, those two districts \u2013 NY-22 and ME-02 \u2013 were also among their most active. The party and its allies ran about 2,000 ads over the course of the week in the Maine 2nd, it\u2019s most active race during the week. Ranking second in activity for Republicans was the Minnesota 8th, another Tossup. In NY-22, both parties and affiliated Super PACs unleashed a torrent of ads \u2013 Republican groups such as the Congressional Leadership Fund and National Republican Congressional Committee faced off against Democratic-funded End Citizens United and House Majority PAC. One NRCC attack ad accuses Democratic Assemblyman Anthony Brindisi, who is challenging Republican Rep. Claudia Tinney, of wanting to slash Medicare by $800 billion aired nearly 500 times during the week, in heavy rotation during daytime TV \u2013 making it the most active ad during that period in the race. Nationally, as the midterm election rounds the bend toward Election Day, it\u2019s been quite a year for campaign ads. In both House and Senate races since January 1, there have been nearly 893,000 Democratic political ads that ran on television, and just over 680,000 Republican ones.",

            "article_content": "Some of the biggest names in Democratic politics are descending on South Carolina in the final weeks of the midterms, introducing themselves to voters and operatives in a state that will be crucial in the party\u2019s 2020 presidential primary. Former Vice President Joe Biden, Montana Gov. Steve Bullock, South Bend Mayor Pete Buttigieg, attorney Michael Avenatti, New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, California Sen. Kamala Harris, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and former New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg have already or are expected to visit the Palmetto State in the home stretch of the 2018 election. Several of the big names are appearing alongside South Carolina\u2019s 2018 Democratic candidates such as gubernatorial nominee James Smith and 1st Congressional District candidate Joe Cunningham. Biden, Bullock and Buttigieg each did events with the men this past weekend. Booker and Harris will be revving up the base while speaking at GOTV rallies up and down the state, and Bloomberg is headlining a fundraiser for incumbent Rep. Jim Clyburn \u2013 the only Democrat in South Carolina\u2019s congressional delegation. The early attention South Carolina is receiving from potential 2020 Democratic candidate shows the important role the state plays in the party\u2019s nominating contest. While Iowa and New Hampshire lay claim to being the first in the nation contests, South Carolina is the first state where Democratic candidates will test their appeal with African-American voters, a key voting bloc to winning the nomination. Due the primary schedule, the South Carolina primary is the last one to take place before Super Tuesday on March 3, when nine states will hold their primaries. The winner in South Carolina could take their momentum into those contests. A range of Democrats in the state told CNN they are torn by all the early attention the state is getting from national figures. On the one hand, they say, the visits are driving excitement and turnout among the party faithful. On the other, having state candidates tied to the typically more liberal Democrats on the national stage opens those candidates up to attack from their Republican opponents. \u201cUsually we are second fiddle and it seems like this year we may be getting more active early on than Iowa and New Hampshire just due to the schedule of the primaries,\u201d said former state Democratic representative Boyd Brown. \u201cWhoever wins South Carolina, that\u2019s an indicator of who wins Super Tuesday.\u201d \u201cSome of us wish it would wait. We don\u2019t need our candidates tied to Bernie Sanders in October before an election,\u201d Brown said, but added that Democrats in the state are energized for the midterms in a way that he hasn\u2019t seen before. Amanda Loveday, the former executive director of the state party, also pointed to Sanders coming down to South Carolina for a solo event, this close to the midterms, as an unwise move. \u201cI definitely think he has supporters, but I don\u2019t think that right now is a good time for him to be traveling to South Carolina specifically because he wasn\u2019t invited by a candidate who is running on a 2018 ballot,\u201d Loveday said. Sanders will be in speaking at a rally in Columbia on Saturday hosted by Our Revolution as part of a nine-state tour ahead of the midterms. South Carolina is the only state on Sanders\u2019 tour where he won\u2019t be appearing alongside a candidate running in the midterms. Palmetto State Democrats like Brown and Loveday quickly expressed their frustration at Sanders\u2019 decision to come without taking the stage alongside a Democrat running for office this cycle. When Sanders\u2019 visit was announced, South Carolina Republicans and Smith\u2019s opponent, Republican Gov. Henry McMaster, immediately started tying Smith to Sanders and said the two would be campaigning together, even though that is not what will be happening. Smith has been attempting to distance himself from Sanders, explaining that he does not support the Independent senator from Vermont\u2019s agenda. State representative and attorney Justin Bamberg \u2013 who backed Sanders in 2016 and is up for re-election this November \u2013 pointed out that some of Bernie\u2019s key ideas, like his Medicare for All Act, also got the backing of Sens. Booker, Warren and Harris. \u201cWhy is everyone so afraid of Bernie Sanders?\u201d he posed, adding that \u201cI think people are missing the point here that one of the big reasons that Bernie is coming to South Carolina is to talk about his concept of healthcare, and that\u2019s not coming up enough in the conversation. Everyone wants to make it about presidential candidates.\u201d He said that his fellow Democrats who were worried about being tied to a presidential candidate are \u201cbeing paranoid. Citizens are going to choose who they want to choose.\u201d Getting a grasp for South Carolina early on is crucial for any and all prospective presidential candidates, Democratic strategist Antjuan Seawright said. \u201cI think it\u2019s good if these 2020 candidates come before November 6th if they have the right intentions, which include turning out voters for the midterm elections and understanding how politics are done in South Carolina,\u201d Seawright told CNN in a phone interview. \u201cI think how politics is done in South Carolina is a true reflection of where we need to be as a country. So goes the south, so goes the heartbeat of America.\u201d \u201cOn the road to the White House and heaven, there is an exit that says South Carolina \u2013 must stop here if you want to be president,\u201d Seawright added. Trav Robertson, the current chairman of the South Carolina Democratic Party, thinks the surge of national politicians coming to South Carolina is a good thing, not a bad thing. Robertson cited costs of Medicaid, local corruption, and expensive power bills as top issues for his base in the midterms elections that are just a few weeks away. \u201cEverybody pays a power bill, everybody has got somebody that\u2019s sick, and we are all touched by the corruption in this state. If Bernie wants to come talk about those issues and Nina Turner and get national attention on that fact\u2026if they want to come down here and talk about those issues, by God let\u2019s get them down here to talk about them,\u201d Robertson told CNN. He said that the Trump presidency has forced politics into a \u201cdifferent environment\u201d than he\u2019s seen in past election cycles. Robertson sees visits from top national politicians as a way to motivate his base and get out the vote efforts. While the number of prospective candidates may be staggering, former state party chairman Jaime Harrison says South Carolina maintains an open-door policy, welcoming any and all who are thinking about taking a stab at a run. \u201cI think that the doors to South Carolina are open to all. The thing I\u2019ve told all the candidates who\u2019ve reached out to me is that we are here to help,\u201d Harrison said. \u201cThey should definitely come and visit and talk with our voters here and learn more about the state. I think that\u2019s an important step for all of them to do.\u201d One potential candidate who doesn\u2019t need an introduction to South Carolina is former Vice President Biden, who maintains close connections to Palmetto State politics. Biden has been to South Carolina twice over the last year, most recently this past weekend, where he headlined a Charleston fundraiser for his friend, Democratic gubernatorial candidate James Smith. Biden and Smith\u2019s relationship goes back several years, since Smith and Biden\u2019s late son Beau served overseas in the military during overlapping time periods in 2009. Some Democratic operatives in the state believe that, regardless if Smith wins or loses this November, his organization of supporter lists, donors and staffers can easily be turned over to a Biden presidential campaign and give the former vice president a leg up going into 2020. During a stop for breakfast alongside Smith in Mount Pleasant, South Carolina, on Saturday, Biden told a crowd of reporters that he isn\u2019t running for president just yet. \u201cNo, not yet. And I don\u2019t know whether I will or not,\u201d Biden said. Dick Harpootlian, a longtime South Carolina Democratic official who is now running for a state Senate seat in November, hosted Biden this weekend for an event at his home in Columbia. Harpootlian described a crowd of about 100 people who gathered to hear him spread a message that working families are hurting. Biden also taped a commercial with Harpootlian to help with his race. He thought that the 2020 race may be starting \u201ca little early\u201d this cycle but pointed out that he had met then-Sen. Barack Obama for the first time in April 2007. \u201cThe primary process is starting two years ahead of time. Yeah, they come in early because they don\u2019t have any money or name recognition,\u201d he said of the upcoming Cory Booker and Kamala Harris visits. Harpootlian also warned that candidates like Sanders and Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren will likely not sell well in the southern state. \u201cIf Biden decides to run it will be very difficult for anyone to compete with him here.\u201d There\u2019s also the sentiment among South Carolina Democrats that Biden can appeal to a wider range of voters in the state ahead of the midterms and beyond. \u201cThe only one who can come down and not hurt a [down-ballot] candidate is Joe Biden,\u201d Brown said. But not all Palmetto State Democrats are thinking it\u2019s Biden or bust. \u201cThere are some rising stars making trips down, people like Cory Booker and Kamala Harris and Eric Holder, Deval Patrick. Folks who, because they\u2019re African-American, will also be able to do some kinship with voters,\u201d Harrison said. With Harris and Booker taking their first trips to the state this coming weekend with several voter-facing events on their schedules, some think that these younger, more diverse faces will generate more excitement amongst a changing voter base. \u201cWe as Democrats need to be focused on how do we excite our base, how do we get our people to vote,\u201d Harrison said. \u201cThat\u2019s the most important thing.\u201d Correction: This story has been updated to correctly describe Justin Bamberg's position.",

            "article_content": "Health care is dominating the 2018 midterm elections. In nearly every competitive Senate, House and governor\u2019s race, Democrats are turning the issue into the focal point of their television advertising campaigns, debate strategies and stump speeches. As a result, Republicans are having to adjust to a shifting political reality: Voters have traditionally punished the party that seeks to change the nation\u2019s health laws. For nearly a decade, that meant Democrats spent every election cycle under attack. Now, Republicans who called for the repeal of President Barack Obama\u2019s health care law \u2013 which features some popular elements, like protections for those with pre-existing conditions \u2013 are on the defensive. For many GOP candidates, it\u2019s the first time they\u2019ve been forced to answer for their own histories and propose their own solutions. The American public has swung drastically in Democrats\u2019 favor on Obamacare. At this point four years ago, 48% of registered voters felt the law went too far \u2013 but now, that\u2019s down to 36%, a new Fox News poll found. Meanwhile, a majority think it\u2019s either about right (21%) or didn\u2019t go far enough (30%). And 64% of registered voters want to see more people insured, even if doing so costs the government more money. Seizing on the political opening, Democrats have spent nearly $125 million on TV ads focused on health care this year, compared to just $50 million in health care-focused ads from Republicans, according to the political ad tracking firm Kantar Media/CMAG. 30 seconds that tell the story of Democrats in 2018 The pressure has left some GOP candidates spinning \u2013 insisting that they would defend pre-existing conditions protections and lower health care costs without detailing exactly how they\u2019d do that. Even Republicans who haven\u2019t voted to repeal Obamacare or sued to block portions of it are under fire over health care. In Indiana, the home to one of the most competitive races for US Senate, Republican challenger Mike Braun is airing television ads touting the health coverage offered by his own business, where he says insurance premiums have remained flat for 10 years. But a closer look at his business casts doubt on whether a Braun-style plan would be a better deal for most Americans. What Braun doesn\u2019t say in his ads: His company\u2019s insurance plan features a deductible of $5,000 per year for individuals and $10,000 per year for families, according to the employee handbook of Braun\u2019s auto-parts business, Meyer Distributing, obtained by CNN. High deductibles are one of Americans\u2019 chief health care complaints and are a top target for Republicans\u2019 attacks on Obamacare. The average deductible nationally is $1,500 for single plans, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. That means Braun\u2019s company\u2019s workers who get sick could face steeper-than-average medical bills. High deductibles are also a way to keep premiums in check. Meyer\u2019s employee handbook shows that workers pay $34.30 biweekly in premiums for themselves or $198.44 for a family. Compared to national averages, that\u2019s about $300 cheaper for the year for single workers and $550 cheaper for those whose plans cover their families in 2017, according to Kaiser. The company did not respond to a request for comment on its health insurance plans. Democratic Sen. Joe Donnelly\u2019s campaign says the high-deductible plan undercuts Braun\u2019s argument that he has better solutions to rising health insurance costs. \u201cEven his overhyped health care plan for his own employees is only a \u2018solution\u2019 if they\u2019re as wealthy as he is,\u201d Donnelly spokesman Will Baskin-Gerwitz said. And Braun\u2019s campaign answered questions about his company\u2019s health care plan with an attack on Donnelly. \u201cWhile Hoosier premiums doubled and all but two insurers fled Indiana on Senator Donnelly\u2019s watch, Mike Braun delivered solutions by taking on the insurance companies, holding premiums steady for 10 years running and covering pre-existing conditions before it was cool,\u201d said Braun spokesman Josh Kelley. One of the most dramatic midterm makeovers is happening in Texas, where Sen. Ted Cruz \u2013 the man who once played a leading role in a 2013 government shutdown against his own party\u2019s wishes in a failed bid to repeal Obamacare \u2013 is now defending one of its core elements. Cruz campaigned for president in 2016 on the promise to repeal \u201cevery single word\u201d of Obamacare. In early 2017, Cruz argued that Congress should repeal Obamacare immediately, and then work out a new version of health reform afterward. Now, he says, there\u2019s one part of Obamacare he wouldn\u2019t roll back. \u201cYou need to understand, everyone agrees we\u2019re going to protect pre-existing conditions,\u201d Cruz said while lambasting Obamacare for increasing insurance premiums during a debate last week. Cruz touted his \u201cConsumer Freedom Amendment,\u201d introduced last year, which he said would have protected those with pre-existing conditions. But the bill would have created parallel markets, with insurers offering some plans that don\u2019t meet Obamacare\u2019s requirements and others that do. The prices of those that do meet the law\u2019s requirements would skyrocket, health care policy experts said at the time. Insurance companies lobbied against Cruz\u2019s proposal. His Democratic challenger, Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke, said: \u201cI don\u2019t know how you\u2019re going to repeal every single word of the Affordable Care Act and keep protections for pre-existing conditions.\u201d In Missouri, Republican attorney general Josh Hawley \u2013 who is challenging vulnerable Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill \u2013 attempted to address a growing political problem with a new television advertisement this week. In the 30-second, straight-to-camera spot, Hawley says he and his wife learned their oldest son has a \u201crare chronic disease\u201d earlier this year \u2013 \u201ca pre-existing condition. We know what that\u2019s like.\u201d \u201cI support forcing insurance companies to cover all pre-existing conditions,\u201d Hawley says in the ad. Wanted to share a little about my family and our journey, and my commitment to protecting people with preexisting conditions \u2014 like my son #MOSen pic.twitter.com/g7u9RzN1iO However, Hawley is one of 20 Republican state officials who signed onto a federal lawsuit seeking to strike down former President Barack Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act as unconstitutional. They are backed by President Donald Trump\u2019s Department of Justice, which would strike down the pre-existing conditions protections but not the whole law. If they succeed, that would mean eliminating Obamacare\u2019s mandate that prevents insurers from denying coverage or charging higher premiums to the 52 million non-elderly adults with pre-existing conditions. \u201cNerve,\u201d McCaskill tweeted in response to Hawley\u2019s ad. \u201cHe sues to wipe out the protection then \u2018goes to camera\u2019 to say he doesn\u2019t mean it. He knows there are zero protections for pre-existing conditions if his lawsuit is successful.\u201d And this. Get the idea? Nerve. He sues to wipe out the protection then \u201cgoes to camera\u201d to say he doesn\u2019t mean it. He knows there are zero protections for pre-existing conditions if his lawsuit is successful. https://t.co/CtxeY1Y23d In a late bid to insulate Republicans on the issue, Nevada Sen. Dean Heller \u2013 the most vulnerable GOP senator this year \u2013 and nine other Republicans introduced a bill in August intended to keep protections for those with pre-existing conditions in place. However, health care policy experts pointed out that while the bill would forbid insurers from rejecting or jacking up prices for those with pre-existing conditions, it would allow them to exclude coverage related to those conditions \u2013 or base prices on factors like age, gender and occupation. And the bill hasn\u2019t stopped Heller\u2019s Democratic challenger, Rep. Jacky Rosen, from attacking him for voting in favor of the repeal effort. Republicans have also tried to pivot away from the issue of pre-existing conditions by contrasting their positions with the growing Democratic support for single-payer health coverage. In hammering the GOP over health care, the lawsuit could be the single most effective weapon Democrats have as November\u2019s midterm elections approach. In at least eight gubernatorial races, Democratic candidates and their supporters have aired television ads focused on pre-existing conditions. They\u2019ve used the lawsuit to target Ohio attorney general Mike DeWine, who signed onto the lawsuit and is running for governor. West Virginia attorney general Patrick Morrisey, who is challenging Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin, is another Republican who has signed onto the lawsuit. In Wisconsin, Gov. Scott Walker\u2019s Democratic challenger, state education chief Tony Evers, last week challenged Walker to drop out of the lawsuit. In a show of how complicated the politics are for Republicans, Walker has backed the lawsuit but promised he would call a special session of the state legislature to pass a law requiring coverage for pre-existing conditions if the lawsuit is successful. The Democratic attacks also involve previous lawsuits \u2013 like those Michigan attorney general and gubernatorial hopeful Bill Schuette signed onto. Schuette, who promised for years to undo Obama\u2019s signature law, has this year insisted he wants to protect those with pre-existing conditions. And they\u2019ve focused on years\u2019 worth of GOP votes to repeal Obamacare. In Florida, on Tuesday Democratic gubernatorial candidate Andrew Gillum released a new ad bashing his GOP opponent, former Rep. Ron DeSantis, for voting to repeal Obamacare, charging that \u201cDeSantis demanded that any new health law eliminate protections for people with pre-existing conditions.\u201d DeSantis responded by highlighting Gillum\u2019s calls for single-payer \u201cMedicare for all,\u201d saying that Gillum is running on a plan \u201cthat would abolish private health care for millions of Floridians.\u201d But, like in Indiana, Democrats haven\u2019t needed their Republican foes to sign onto the lawsuit or vote to repeal Obamacare to make health care their focal point. In Montana, Democratic Sen. Jon Tester\u2019s supporters are lambasting his GOP challenger Matt Rosendale, the state auditor, for green-lighting insurance companies\u2019 plans for rate hikes and for hiring an insurance industry lobbyist as his deputy insurance commissioner. FACT CHECKING @JonTester's new commercial. The result ... LIES!!!\u00a0Don't listen to #TwoFacedTester!

            "article_content": "It might be a rocky road for seven Democratic House candidates in their respective races, but the co-founders of Ben & Jerry\u2019s ice cream are hoping to float them to Congress. Together with the liberal grassroots organization MoveOn.org, Ben Cohen and Jerry Greenfield are encouraging supporters to create ice cream flavors and names to help the progressive House candidates, who are challenging incumbents in mostly safe Republican districts. They intend on making a batch of each of the seven flavors to raffle off to support the candidates, which include long-shot bids by J.D. Scholten, who\u2019s hoping to unseat Iowa Rep. Steve King, Lauren Underwood, who is taking on Illinois Rep. Randy Hultgren, and Ammar Campa-Najjar who\u2019s facing off against California Rep. Duncan Hunter. \u201cWe wanted to do our part to check President Trump\u2019s unrestrained power and send progressive champions to Congress who will really fight for working people and not just blow smoke,\u201d Cohen tweeted on Friday in promoting the contest. \u201cTo guys like us, that means cranking up the old ice cream freezer.\u201d The two co-founders said in a press release on MoveOn.org that they want candidates who will push \u201cMedicare for All, protect clean air and water, and get big money out of politics.\u201d Cohen and Greenfield have dipped into politics before. During the 2016 election, Cohen invented an ice cream flavor called \u201cBernie\u2019s Yearning\u201d to honor Vermont independent Sen. Bernie Sanders, and several pints were given away in a contest organized by Sanders\u2019 campaign. Their company, Ben & Jerry\u2019s Homemade Inc., said it had nothing to do with the Sanders flavor and that all costs were paid for by the Sanders campaign. The dessert duo were also among hundreds of protesters arrested in Washington in April 2016 at a demonstration against money in politics.",

            "article_content": "It\u2019s just a 30-second spot, but it says everything you need to know about Democrats and 2018. Senate Democrat Joe Manchin, ambling through a field in hunting clothes, highlights what he calls a threat to West Virginia \u2013 a lawsuit supported by his opponent that Manchin says would take away health care from people with pre-existing conditions. \u201cHe is just dead wrong, and that ain\u2019t gonna happen,\u201d says Manchin, who has often mentioned his knee replacement as a pre-existing condition during his re-election run. The ad closes as he hoists his shotgun and takes aim at a paper copy of the lawsuit. No mention of Russia. No talk of a constitutional crisis. No Trump. After two midterm cycles where they couldn\u2019t find their footing or a good message on the Affordable Care Act, Democrats are no longer running scared on Obamacare. Instead, they are making it part of their identity. Democrats are on the attack, aiming to rebrand the law and their party by making personal and emotional pleas. While the national story often focuses on Russia, Trump\u2019s latest tweet, abuse of power, the disarray in the White House and the constant question about what the Democratic Party stands for, Democrats have opted to largely skip the national topics, focusing instead on the pocketbook issue of health care. In 2010, Democrats were skipping town halls to avoid voters\u2019 rage over impending changes to health care. Now, in ad after ad, they are all about health care. North Dakota Democrat Heidi Heitkamp mentions her own struggle with breast cancer as she narrates the story of a woman named Denise Sandvick, who has a heart condition. Looking directly into the camera, Sandvick calls out Heitkamp\u2019s opponent, Kevin Cramer, for voting \u201cto let insurance companies go back to denying coverage for pre-existing conditions.\u201d \u201cI know Heidi would never do that,\u201d she adds. Physician Rob Davidson, a Michigan Democrat running against Rep. Bill Huizenga, clad in a white doctor\u2019s coat says the health care system is \u201ccompletely broken\u201d and he can fix it. Clarke Tucker, running in for the House in Arkansas, closes a biographical ad with a mention of beating cancer and becoming \u201cone of the million Arkansans with a pre-existing condition.\u201d A few others running with ads featuring health care as a central theme: Jacky Rosen, running for Senate in Nevada, Amy McGrath running in Kentucky\u2019s 6th Congressional District, Kyrsten Sinema running for Senate in Arizona, Haley Stevens running in Michigan\u2019s 11th Congressional District. Overall, according to political advertising tracker CMAG, Democratic spending on health care ads in Senate races is $40.8 million and $38.3 million in House races through September 4, outpacing ad spending on other issues by millions of dollars. And witness Barack Obama, often derided by progressives as not going far enough on health care, embracing Medicare-for-all as one of Democrats\u2019 \u201cgood new ideas\u201d during his return to the campaign trail. For years, Obamacare has been an electoral burden for Democrats, leading to massive setbacks among voters. Now, Obama, could be poised to take a delayed victory lap over his signature issue. What\u2019s so different now? Polls. A recent CNN poll shows that health care is the top issue voters will consider when voting this November. (The economy is a close second.) A Kaiser Health poll from July shows that 48% of the public have a favorable view of the Affordable Care Act and 40% holding an unfavorable view. The favorable attitude towards the ACA rises to 51% among independent voters. Now, Democrats are helped by the fact that people are actually benefiting from the law and it\u2019s not just a messy hypothetical. Federal data show more Obamacare recipients sticking with their plans. While the actions of Republicans to tear at the fabric of the measure\u2019s protections may feel like worlds away in political terms, Democrats are seeking ways to remind voters of the attempts to overturn the law and the consequences at stake. \u201cThe debate over the ACA last year accomplished several things. It helps the benefit of Obamacare crystallize in the minds of voters,\u201d said Andrew Bates, the communications director for American Bridge\u2019s House campaign effort. \u201cIt defined the GOP as the party that was willing to cost millions of people health care \u2026 all to cut taxes for the rich. That made a lasting impact.\u201d Josh Holmes, a Republican strategist, sees a different political landscape, one dominated by everything Trump. \u201cIt\u2019s incredibly naive for anyone to think they can make nuanced policy arguments in the current political environment,\u201d he said. \u201cThe decibel level of the national debate that is largely driven by President Trump completely drowns out any policy messaging campaign this cycle.\u201d In the current climate, it\u2019s hard to argue that a policy debate has a \u201clasting impact,\u201d but in ads and messaging, Democrats are reminding voters where GOP candidates stood on the ACA repeal. It\u2019s a reversal of 2010, when GOP candidates were unified in their message, and Democrats struggled. Democrats lost the House in 2010 because of Obamacare, and in 2018, they could win because of it. CNN\u2019s David Wright contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Here are the stories our D.C. insiders are talking about in this week\u2019s \u201cInside Politics\u201d forecast, where you get a glimpse of tomorrow\u2019s headlines today. Is the President ready for November? CNN national political correspondent Maeve Reston said she\u2019s hearing from Republican operatives and donors worried that President Trump and his top advisers don\u2019t realize how bad November\u2019s election could be for them. \u201cThere\u2019s real concern that he is totally delusional about the chances of keeping the House,\u201d Reston said. \u201cThat\u2019s in part because there aren\u2019t a lot of people who are around him willing to tell him the truth.\u201d With the President under siege at home, he may soon borrow a familiar White House tactic: a focus on foreign affairs. \u201cPresidents often, when they get in trouble at home, go abroad and they find that\u2019s a way to escape their troubles,\u201d said New York Times White House reporter Michael Shear. Trump will address the UN General Assembly later this month, and has trips to Europe and South America planned for after the election. \u201cPresident Trump hasn\u2019t always been as successful using the foreign trips as a way of getting away from trouble,\u201d said Shear, citing the Helsinski summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin. \u201cBut at least it\u2019s an opportunity to change the subject, and if the Democrats do take over the House he\u2019ll want to try to do that.\u201d President Trump\u2019s recent rallies have included a new rallying cry: I\u2019m the one who will save your Social Security and Medicare. \u201cThe President is saying Democrats want to kill Social Security and Medicare, while the Republicans are not going to do anything to it,\u201d Bloomberg White House correspondent Toluse Olorunnipa said. Trump is making that promise despite so many of his fellow Republicans vowing to rein in entitlement spending. \u201cDemocrats are pushing back, saying Republicans aren\u2019t necessarily trying to save Social Security, their tax cuts are making it harder to fund those programs,\u201d said Olorunnipa. After the Trump-Putin summit in Helsinki, there was a clamor in Congress to do more to punish Russia for election meddling that appears to be going on to this day. But Washington Post congressional reporter Karoun Demirjian said nothing looks imminent. \u201cThe GOP basically said, hold on hold on, we\u2019re going to go through a step-by-step process first,\u201d said Demirjian. \u201cThat process began in earnest last week, it\u2019s picking up steam this week. The question is, are they actually going to do anything before the midterm elections come about? It\u2019s not necessarily clear that they have the time or inclination to do so.\u201d And from CNN\u2019s chief national correspondent John King: Last week there was evidence of a dip in President Trump\u2019s approval rating. This week the overwhelming focus was on White House chaos and the character and temperament questions raised by the new Bob Woodward book and then the anonymous New York Times essay from a senior administration official. Not great developments for Republicans trying to protect the GOP House majority, to say the least. Inside 60 days now to the midterms, most Republicans with significant campaign experience concede the odds of protecting the House majority are bleak \u2013 and concede the past week or two has, to be polite, not been very helpful. But there are some top GOP strategists who still see a path. Their mantra: make the election about the economy, and local issues; block out President Trump and his Twitter feed as much as possible and get it right when it comes to the nuts and bolts of organizing, turnout and fund-raising. Even in this group, though, the assessments at the 60-day mark had seeds of worry. First the math. \u201cI can still make the case for 15-20,\u201d said a longtime GOP strategist involved in 2018 House races, meaning a case that the Republicans lose seats but that Democrats do not get the 23-seat gain needed for the majority. This strategist went on to say, \u201cI can also see 20 to 30, but I believe we are still in play.\u201d Meaning still in play to keep the Democratic gains below 23. A second GOP operative, with some three decades experience, said as of this weekend, \u201cI have us down 17/18 net in the House.\u201d But both operatives pointed to trouble signs beyond any worries about how the President conducts himself. The powerful national economic news should help GOP candidates. But the second operative said there was growing evidence that \u201ctariffs are starting to have a real impact in the Midwest \u2013 Michigan, for example \u2013  and farm country.\u201d Both operatives also gave Democrats begrudging credit for tapping into concerns about health care costs and access. \u201cHealth care is now a roaring issue and the GOP has no answers,\u201d the second strategist said.",

            "article_content": "Former President Barack Obama offered his most pointed critique to date of President Donald Trump, delivering a lengthy and direct indictment Friday of the last two years in American politics by arguing the President is \u201ccapitalizing on resentment that politicians have been fanning for years.\u201d The speech before more than a thousand students at the University of Illinois-Urbana Champaign was a preview of the message Obama will carry into the midterm elections. But it also represented the former President\u2019s most comprehensive condemnation of Republicans in Washington and the first time he has publicly criticized Trump by name in a speech. \u201cYou happen to be coming of age\u201d amid backlash to progress, Obama told the students. \u201cIt did not start with Donald Trump, he is a symptom, not the cause. He is just capitalizing on resentment that politicians have been fanning for years. A fear, an anger that is rooted in our past but is also borne in our enormous upheavals that have taken place in your brief lifetimes.\u201d Obama spent a sizable portion of his remarks criticizing Republicans in Congress, saying \u201cthe politics of resentment and paranoia has unfortunately found a home in the Republican Party\u201d over the last few decades and argued that the policies GOP leaders are pursuing aren\u2019t conservative. The Republican National Committee responded to Obama\u2019s criticism by saying \u201cPresident Obama stepped back into the spotlight to make the case that our country is on the wrong track.\u201d \u201c2016 is over, but President Obama is still dismissing the millions of voters across the country who rejected a continuation of his policies in favor of President Trump\u2019s plan for historic tax cuts, new jobs and economic growth,\u201d RNC spokesperson Ellie Hockenbury said in a statement. \u201cDemocrats may have a new resistor-in-chief on the campaign trail, but they\u2019ll need more than a message of resist and obstruct to win this November.\u201d Trump responded to Obama\u2019s speech by telling a crowd in North Dakota \u201cI watched it, but I fell asleep. I\u2019ve found he\u2019s very good for sleeping.\u201d While Obama only mentioned Trump by name twice in the speech, it was clear that the remarks were aimed squarely at the man he handed power to in 2017. \u201cIt shouldn\u2019t be Democratic or Republican to say that we don\u2019t target groups of people because of what they look like or how they pray. \u2026 We are supposed to stand up to discrimination and we are sure as heck to stand up clearly and unequivocally to Nazi sympathizers,\u201d Obama said, an apparent rebuke of Trump telling reporters after the deadly white supremacist protests in Charlottesville, Virginia that there was good \u201cfine people on both sides.\u201d \u201cHow hard can that be, saying that Nazis are bad?\u201d Obama said. And he slammed Trump for his treatment of the Department of Justice and FBI. \u201cIt should not be Democratic or Republican, it should not be partisan to say that we don\u2019t pressure the Department of Justice or the FBI to use the criminal justice system as a cudgel to punish our political opponents,\u201d he said. \u201cOr to explicitly call for the attorney general to protect members of own party from prosecution because elections happen to be coming up. I am not making that up. That is not hypothetical.\u201d Trump blasted his Attorney General Jeff Sessions earlier this week, lamenting the separate indictments of two GOP lawmakers who were his earliest supporters in Congress during the 2016 election, suggesting they should not have been charged because they are Republicans. At one point, a seemingly exasperated Obama openly questioned what happened with the Republican Party, noting that one of their early organizing principles was standing up to communism. \u201cWhat happened to the Republican Party?\u201d he said. \u201cIts central organizing principle in foreign policy was the fight against communism and now they are cozying up to the former head of the KGB, actively blocking legislation that would defend our elections from Russia attack. What happened?\u201d He added: \u201cI don\u2019t mean to pretend I am channeling Abraham Lincoln, but that is not what he had in mind, I think, when he helped form the Republican Party. It is not conservative, it sure isn\u2019t normal. It is radical. It is a vision that says the protection of our power and those that back us is all the matters even when it hurts the country.\u201d The remarks, Obama said, were not meant to depress the young voters in the audience, but instead inspire them to understand that their voice matters. \u201cDon\u2019t tell me your vote doesn\u2019t matter,\u201d he said, referring to voting as the \u201cantidote\u201d to all that ails Washington. \u201cAnd if you thought elections don\u2019t matter, I hope these last two years have corrected the impression.\u201d He acknowledged that politicians \u2013 including himself \u2013 had said similar messages about the importance of upcoming elections, but he added, \u201cjust a glance at recent headlines should tell you that this moment really is different, the stakes really are higher, the consequences of any of us sitting on the sidelines are more dire.\u201d The speech ended Obama\u2019s lengthy reprieve from political public life, one that has annoyed some Democrats who believed he was sitting on on a what they call a generational fight against Trump. Obama joked at the outset of the speech that he needed time away to stay married to his wife, Michelle Obama, and to spend time with his daughters. But his decision to step back into the political fray also comes at a time when Democrats, through the midterm elections, could deliver their most potent referendum on Trump to date. Obama viewed the speech as arguably his most important of the year, his aides said, and was editing the remarks up until he touched down in Illinois. Obama will soon take the remarks on the road, too. On Saturday, he will headline a rally for a handful of Democratic congressional candidates in California and next Thursday an event for Richard Cordray, the Democratic gubernatorial candidate in Ohio. Obama is also planning campaign trips to Pennsylvania in September, an Obama official said, as well as a New York fundraiser for the National Democratic Redistricting Committee, an organization led by former Attorney General Eric Holder, Obama\u2019s longtime friend. Obama has made some appearances since Trump took office \u2013 including headlining a fundraiser for the Democratic National Committee earlier this year \u2013 but the Trump era has complicated Obama\u2019s post-presidency. A series of former presidents have avoided critiquing their successors, and Obama has attempted to keep that tradition since he left office in January 2017. Trump has not honored that tradition and has shown little to no regard for his predecessors, regularly bashing them on Twitter, to the media and at rallies. And the two have not talked since the inauguration in 2017, sources told CNN. Obama\u2019s remarks represented that nonexistent relationship and while he focused some of his ire on Democrats \u2013 arguing that the party cannot embrace the tactics of Trump as a way to get back at him \u2013 Obama\u2019s speech seethed with his view that the Trump administration is not the new normal. \u201cAnd by the way the idea that everything will turn out OK because there are people inside the White House who secretly aren\u2019t following the President\u2019s orders,\u201d Obama said of the anonymous op-ed in The New York Times this week, published by a Senior Administration Official. \u201cThat is not a check. I am being serious here. That is not how our democracy is supposed to work.\u201d Democrats, especially those in the room, welcomed Obama\u2019s decision to step back into the fray. The speech in the university\u2019s 1,300-person auditorium has seen sizable interest from the school\u2019s student body, according to university spokesman Jon Davis, who said they had received around 22,000 requests for tickets from students. But Republicans also said they were eager to see Obama back in the news, arguing he is the best weapon they have to motivate their base. \u201cFor three cycles (2010, 2012, 2014) President Obama fired up Republicans like nobody,\u201d Rep. Steve Stivers, the head of the National Republican Congressional Committee, told reporters on Friday. \u201cAnd I\u2019m happy he wants to do it again.\u201d But Obama showed on Friday that he has a potent critique for those Republicans: Mocking them for ignoring the principles they touted during his presidency. \u201cSuddenly deficits do not matter, even though two years ago, when the deficit was lower, they said I couldn\u2019t afford to help working families or seniors on Medicare because the deficit was an existential crisis,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat changed? What changed?\u201d And on jobs, he sought to remind those in the room - but more directly Republicans back in Washington - that his last two years were times of economic growth. \u201cI mention all of this because when you hear how great the economy is doing right now, let\u2019s just remember when this recovery started,\u201d he said, subtly knocking Trump, a president who often cites jobs numbers. \u201cI am glad it has continued but when you hear about his economic miracle that has been going on, when the job number comes out, monthly job numbers and suddenly Republicans say it is a miracle, I have to kind of remind them, actually those job numbers were the same they were in 2015, in 2016. Anyway, I digress.\u201d Obama library gets an architect Obama has spent much of 2018 away from the political fray, focusing on writing his book and raising money for his post-presidency foundation. And he never said Trump\u2019s name during his fundraising speech for the DNC and instead urged Democrats to stop \u201cmoping\u201d and get to work for candidates. That speech, in the eyes of Obama\u2019s team, was not a preview of the former President\u2019s midterm message. Instead, Obama\u2019s advisers believe his midterm message will more closely resemble the remarks the former President delivered in South Africa as part of an event honoring the late Nelson Mandela. That speech looked to be more inspiring, and that is exactly what Obama tried to do at the close of his remarks on Friday. \u201cYou can be the generation that at a critical moment, stood up and reminded us just how precious this experiment in democracy really is, just how powerful it can be when we fight for it, when we believe in it,\u201d he said. \u201cI believe in you. I believe you will help lead us in the right direction and I will be right there with you every step of the way.\u201d CNN\u2019s Jeff Zeleny and Allie Malloy contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "A new poll out by Quinnipiac University shows Florida governor\u2019s race within to be basically neck and neck, with Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum, the Democrat, up by three points against Republican Rep. Rob DeSantis. The race will be one of the closely watched contests in November since DeSantis has tied himself to President Donald Trump and defeated more establishment Republicans. Gillum, meanwhile, would become the state\u2019s first black governor, and has the backing of progressives like Bernie Sanders. In the primary, he was the only Democrat running who supported \u201cMedicare for all\u201d single-payer health care. Most likely voters have their minds already made up; 94% said they won\u2019t change their mind on who to vote for before the election. That number didn\u2019t change dependent on which candidate they had picked. The poll was conducted during the time in which a racist robocall targeting Gillum was running and in the news. The poll suggests and extreme divide along party lines. Ninety-two percent of Republicans plan to vote for DeSantis and 93% of Democrats said the same of Gillum. But Gillum does hold an advantage among independents, with a majority (55%) saying they plan to vote for him in November. However, Gillum doesn\u2019t have great name identification. One in five likely voters said they haven\u2019t heard enough about him to say whether they felt favorably or unfavorably towards him. That number is the same among likely independent voters. Among those who did know enough though, 46% said they had a favorable view of the candidate, with only a third who said they saw him as unfavorable. While more people know who DeSantis is, that\u2019s not necessarily a good thing for him. Only 11% said they haven\u2019t heard enough about him to give an opinion, but his favorability is split, with 45% who said they have a favorable opinion of him and 43% who viewed him in an unfavorable manner. Another negative indicator for DeSantis is Trump\u2019s approval rating in Florida. As someone who has pushed his association with the President, DeSantis could be affected by Trump\u2019s disapproval rating of 51% (lower than the rest of the country, but still a majority). Likely voters are nearly tied on whether they like DeSantis or Gillum based on their positions \u2013 47% said they like DeSantis\u2019 positions on the issues and 46% said the same about Gillum. But more voters like Gillum as a person than like DeSantis, with 49% who said they like Gillum and 40% who said they like DeSantis. Gillum, however, also has a much higher number of likley voters who said that they don\u2019t know if they like him as a person.",

Gillum, the mayor of Tallahassee, Fla., is Florida\u2019s first African-American major-party nominee for governor and is a progressive backed by independent Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont. He was the only leading Democrat in his primary to endorse \u201cMedicare-for-all\u201d single-payer health care, a top progressive agenda item and the policy most famously championed by Sanders. An early underdog in a crowded field, the 39-year-old edged out former Rep. Gwen Graham to capture the gubernatorial nomination with the support of grass-roots Florida progressives. He was also backed by a coalition of groups like the Collective PAC, which is dedicated to elevating African-American candidates; Indivisible, an organization formed in response to President Donald Trump\u2019s election in 2016; and the Working Families Party. Gillum will face Republican Rep. Ron DeSantis in November, who has the support of President Donald Trump. DeSantis drew accusations of racism Wednesday when he said Florida voters would \u201cmonkey this up\u201d if they elected his opponent as governor.

            "article_content": "Florida\u2019s high-stakes gubernatorial race will be fought between a progressive Democrat vying to become the state\u2019s first black chief executive and a Republican congressman closely allied with President Donald Trump. In a late primary season shocker, Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum defeated the front-runner, former Rep. Gwen Graham, who had led in the polls for most of the campaign. He emerged from a field of five competitive candidates, in which he was the only non-millionaire and only supporter of \u201cMedicare for all\u201d single-payer health care, to become the state\u2019s first black gubernatorial nominee. \u201cThe point has never been lost on me that my name on the ballot is simply a vessel, is simply the name,\u2019 Gillum told a raucous crowd of supporters in Tallahassee on Tuesday night. \u201cBut what is underneath that name are all the issues that we care so deeply about.\u201d Gillum will face Republican nominee Rep. Ron DeSantis, setting up a clear ideological battle between progressive Democrats and a Trump-styled Republican in a major presidential battleground state. In a statement Tuesday night, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who campaigned for Gillum in Florida earlier this month, cheered the 39-year-old\u2019s \u201cvision\u201d and cast him as an emerging leader in the broader progressive movement. \u201cNo one person can take on the economic and political elites on their own,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cTonight, Floridians joined Andrew in standing up and demanding change in their community. That\u2019s what the political revolution is all about and Andrew Gillum is helping to lead it.\u201d Meanwhile, Trump was tweeting his congratulation to DeSantis, touting the congressman\u2019s \u201cfantastic win.\u201d \u201cRon will be a fantastic Governor,\u201d Trump wrote. \u201cOn to November!\u201d DeSantis was quick to credit the President when speaking after the results came in. \u201cI\u2019m not always the most popular guy in D.C., but I did have support from someone in Washington,\u201d he said on Tuesday night. \u201cIf you walk down Pennsylvania Avenue, he lives in the White House with the pillars in front of it.\u201d Bernie-backed Andrew Gillum scores surprise victory in Florida Democratic governor's race, CNN projects If the primary was any indication, Democrats in Florida and from around the country seem ready to line up behind Gillum and spend to end two decades of Republican rule in the largest swing state. Democrats in the race, including billionaire Jeff Greene and the wealthy former Miami Beach Mayor Philip Levine, splayed out more than $100 million for the chance to wrest back control of the governor\u2019s mansion. Gillum got a late boost when liberal megadonors Tom Steyer and George Soros led a group that donated $650,000 to his affiliated political action committee. As the primary neared, progressive groups \u2013 Indivisible Action, The Collective PAC, The New Florida Vision PAC and the Sanders-inspired Our Revolution among them \u2013 banded together to invest an additional $3.5 million in get out the vote efforts supporting Gillum, who campaigned as an outspoken critic of the state\u2019s controversial \u201cStand Your Ground\u201d gun law, which he said at a protest earlier this month \u201chas no place in a civilized society.\u201d Progressive organizations that backed Gillum from early on, when he was struggling to crack double digits in the polls, celebrated his win as their own as the projections rolled in. Maurice Mitchell, national director of the Working Families Party, which came out for Gillum back in May, called Gillum\u2019s success \u201cproof positive that there\u2019s a progressive revolution underway, and the old guard establishment can either get on board or get out of the way.\u201d Indivisible, the increasingly influential grassroots group formed in the aftermath of the 2016 election, called the primary results a rebuke to Democratic leaders\u2019 conventional wisdom about the state. \u201cFor decades, pundits have acted like the way to win statewide in Florida is to run white, cautious, centrist candidates,\u201d said the organization\u2019s national political director, Mar\u00eda Urbina, who touted local chapters\u2019 who lined up early behind Gillum because he \u201cmatched their values and embraced an unapologetically progressive platform.\u201d In his remarks on Tuesday, Gillum also said expanding Medicaid to the estimated 700,000 people who would qualify under the Affordable Care Act would be among his top priorities if he won in the fall, a Democratic priority that has been stymied by state Republicans. DeSantis, who cruised to victory over state Agriculture Commissioner Adam Putnam, ran a campaign focused closely \u2013 some critics said almost exclusively \u2013 on his support for Trump. He made headlines with an ad, narrated by his wife, that featuring him building a \u201cwall\u201d (of paper blocks) with his young daughter and appearing to read from Trump\u2019s book, \u201cThe Art of the Deal,\u201d to his son. Trump campaigned for DeSantis at an event in Tampa late last month, then tweeted his support again on Monday, calling him \u201ca special person who has done an incredible job.\u201d Putnam was endorsed by state Attorney General Pam Bondi, an early Trump backer. But in a year when the President\u2019s support has been all but required for Republicans running in contested primaries, there was no substitute for the White House itself.",

            "article_content": "The governor\u2019s race in Florida not only says a lot about where the Democratic and Republican parties are today but could also tell us where they are headed in the future. Republican Ron DeSantis is the Donald Trump of the 2018 Florida gubernatorial campaign. He was backed by Trump in the primary, and the endorsement helped him shoot up in the polls. Democrat Andrew Gillum represents the ascendent wing of the Democratic Party. He\u2019s a young, black progressive in a party that is becoming more liberal, younger and more diverse. In other words, Gillum is a picture of what the Democratic presidential nominee might be like in 2020. A win by Gillum over DeSantis would be a clear indicator that Democrats would be in a strong position in Florida headed into 2020 after Hillary Clinton lost the state to Trump in 2016. The state hasn\u2019t elected a Democratic governor since 1994. Democrats have also struggled in presidential elections since that point. Yes, they won the state a few times. Florida, though, never voted more Democratic than the nation as a whole. That is, the state continued to have a red tint to it. Bernie-backed progressive Andrew Gillum will face a Trump-styled Republican Ron DeSantis in Florida's governor's race On the other hand, a DeSantis win would be a sign that the Republican and Trump brand are not as weak as perhaps some thought in the state. A DeSantis win would fit with polling that has Trump\u2019s approval rating in Florida running ahead of where it is nationally. The intrigue in this race, though, doesn\u2019t just come because it is a Democrat versus a Republican in a key swing state. It comes from how Gillum differs from Democrats who have run in the past. Normally, you wouldn\u2019t think that a diverse candidate who represents the left flank of the party is a strong general election candidate in a state like Florida. If Gillum wins, he\u2019d turn that conventional wisdom on its head. Gillum sets a contrast with Republicans in a way that many electorally unsuccessful Democrats in Florida haven\u2019t. Democrats have mostly tried to win Florida with more moderate candidates. They literally put up former a Republican in Charlie Crist to run for governor in 2014, for example. Gillum clearly isn\u2019t in the more moderate camp with his calls for Medicare for all. A Gillum win would put a feather in the gap of progressives like Bernie Sanders heading into 2020 who think Democrats work best with a strong left message. Gillum stands out in other ways versus most prior Democratic candidates for statewide office in Florida. Specifically, he\u2019s a black man who made an exclusive appeal to young voters. That sort of sounds like Barack Obama who won the Sunshine State and the presidency twice. Florida's GOP gubernatorial nominee says a vote for his black opponent would 'monkey this up' Clinton, though, couldn\u2019t follow through on Obama\u2019s electoral success. While Clinton lost for any number of reasons in 2016, one big cause was the lower black turnout. Perhaps that was to be expected without Obama being on the ticket. Still, it was notable. Worrisome to Democrats since 2016 is that the low turnout of black voters has continued into the 2018 cycle. A Gillum win with higher black turnout would suggest that Democrats can raise black turnout again in 2020 as long as they have the right candidate. It doesn\u2019t have to be a black candidate, either \u2013 Doug Jones, a white man who served as the lead prosecutor in a case against two Ku Klux Klan members responsible for the 1963 bombing of a black church, upset Roy Moore in last year\u2019s Alabama Senate election thanks to high black turnout. A Democratic candidate who says they can deliver black votes like Gillum would have a powerful message in a primary. Clinton also struggled mightily among younger voters. Whether you look at the exit polls or voter files, Clinton\u2019s inability to match Obama\u2019s numbers among young voters was a pivotal cause of her defeat. Like with African-Americans, a Gillum win on the backs of young voters could be a sign that they would vote in high numbers for the right candidate in a general election. That would be music to Sanders\u2019 ears for sure. Of course, the election could backfire on Gillum and those have a similar message to him. If DeSantis wins, expect those Democrats who are more centrist and traditional to point to Gillum as a warning sign of what can happen when you try to win over people in a swing state with a progressive message aimed specifically at minorities and young voters. Gillum detractors could argue that Democrats would have blown their best chance at winning the governorship in a generation. In this way, Gillum is a big bet for progressive. If he wins, he\u2019ll be a model for them. If Gillum loses, he\u2019ll be used against progressives in 2020.",

            "article_content": "The progressive left movement vaulted into the national spotlight by Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in June suffered a series of setbacks at the hands of Democratic establishment-backed candidates across the Midwest on Tuesday. Hoping to build on the momentum set in motion by the New Yorker\u2019s stunning defeat of Rep. Joe Crowley, insurgent candidates in Michigan, Missouri and Kansas notched their share of victories, but there were no major surprises \u2014 nearly all the expected winners won \u2013 or dents made in skepticism among party powerbrokers. In Michigan, where Sen. Bernie Sanders won his signature victory in the 2016 presidential primary, former state Senate Minority Leader Gretchen Whitmer routed the insurgent Abdul El-Sayed. El-Sayed had the blessings of Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez, who campaigned for him on consecutive weekends ahead of the primary. But it is Whitmer who, by a considerable margin, will take on Republican Attorney General Bill Schuette in November. Republicans should panic about the House, and other takeaways from Tuesday's elections Her opponent, the 33-year-old son of Egyptian immigrants ran on a statewide \u201cMedicare for all\u201d plan, public internet, tuition-free college and his refusal to accept corporate PAC money. Whitmer opposes an immediate push for single-payer health care, calling it \u201cunrealistic\u201d in the current political environment, and hasn\u2019t sworn off corporate PAC donations. In the aftermath, Whitmer communications director Zack Pohl shared his frustration with a pre-election narrative that, he argued, understated his candidate\u2019s progressive record and offered simplistic assumptions about where the Democratic energy resides. \u201cWomen voters are coming out to the polls in droves all over the country to vote for strong, progressive women candidates, and Michigan was the latest example of that,\u201d Pohl said in an email. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t just Gretchen either. You had strong, progressive women like Haley Stevens, Rashida Tlaib, Gretchen Driskell and Elissa Slotkin defeat male challengers in their primaries as well.\u201d Kansas was kinder to Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s preferred candidates, but they still only emerged with a split decision.

Kevin Yoder, the first Native American woman elected to Congress. She would also become the state\u2019s first gay representative. Another Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez favorite, James Thompson, won comfortably, setting up rematch with GOP Rep. Ron Estes in the state\u2019s 4th Congressional District. Ocasio-Cortez has singled out Thompson\u2019s 2017 special election campaign \u2013 when he came within less than seven points of beating Estes in a district that went for Mike Pompeo by more than 30 just months earlier \u2013 as a model for candidates trying to break through in red regions Democrats were effectively ceding to Republicans. \u201cHe, as a progressive, alone turned that seat from an impossible race to a flippable district,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m hoping that even if a candidate doesn\u2019t win in this cycle, they will have created gains for 2020, for 2022.\u201d It\u2019s a message she had occasion to repeat on Wednesday \u2013 and did, in a tweet: \u201cWins in the short-term are important milemarkers and necessary to building power,\u201d she wrote. \u201cBut you can\u2019t be afraid of loss. Fear keeps people from accomplishing great things.\u201d But there would be no repeat, in any state, of Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s particular feat: unseating an incumbent Democrat. Missouri\u2019s Cori Bush, who campaigned with Ocasio-Cortez a few weeks ago, tried and failed in her bid to oust Rep. William Lacy Clay Jr., whose father, former Rep. William Lacy Clay Sr., was a founding member of the Congressional Black Caucus. The most heartening result for leftists came in Michigan\u2019s 13th Congressional District, where former state lawmaker Rashida Tlaib outlasted a crowded field \u2013 including a family member of the former Rep. John Conyers Jr. \u2013 in a general election primary. Running unopposed in November, Tlaib, a member of the Democratic Socialists of America, will likely become the first Muslim woman in Congress when she arrives early next year on Capitol Hill. She will be one of two DSA members, alongside Ocasio-Cortez, assuming the latter prevails in the fall.",

            "article_content": "The Ohio special election for a House seat that\u2019s been in Republican hands for three decades was too close to call Tuesday night. But that it was close at all shows just how daunting the political landscape facing Republicans is headed into November\u2019s midterm elections. Ohio special election and primary results come in Republicans spent millions of dollars to avoid an embarrassing loss, and President Donald Trump visited the district just days before the election. With early and election day votes counted, Republican Troy Balderson has a 0.9-percentage-point edge over Democrat Danny O\u2019Connor, with absentee and provisional ballots remaining. The other closely watched race where Trump was involved, the Kansas GOP gubernatorial primary, continued into the early Wednesday morning hours. The result there will be a test of Trump\u2019s endorsement and should Kansas Secretary of State Kris Kobach prevail, Democrats believe they could win in the deep-red state (Note: We\u2019ll update this piece as results are finalized). Here are four early takeaways from Tuesday\u2019s Ohio special election and primaries in Kansas, Michigan, Missouri and Washington. The neck-and-neck race in a ruby red Ohio district was the latest evidence that the Republican majority in the House is in peril. Why? Look at the makeup of the district. Trump in 2016 and Mitt Romney in 2012 each won there by 11 percentage points. There are 68 Republican-held House districts that are more favorable for Democrats, per the Cook Political Report\u2019s \u201cPartisan Voter Index,\u201d which factors in recent election results \u2013 and Democrats only need a net gain of 23 seats to take control. Then, consider the turnout. Voters in urban and suburban portions of the district voted at much higher rates than those in its rural, largely pro-Republican areas. The bottom line: Democratic voters are energized, the suburbs are swinging in their favor and Republicans are sitting elections out. If the GOP can\u2019t undo that massive enthusiasm gap by November, its House majority is in serious jeopardy. Signs of panic were evident Tuesday night. Corry Bliss, the executive director of the GOP-aligned Congressional Leadership Fund, issued a statement warning Republicans that his super PAC can\u2019t swamp Democrats in spending in every district, as it did in Ohio. Washington state's primary results paint a grim picture for GOP \u201cWhile we won tonight, this remains a very tough political environment and moving forward, we cannot expect to win tough races when our candidate is being outraised. Any Republican running for Congress getting vastly outraised by an opponent needs to start raising more money,\u201d he said. What Bliss is warning about is a big problem. Per a CNN analysis, an eye-popping 55 Democratic challengers outraised the Republican incumbents they are facing. Late into the night, Republicans were watching as yet another reason to worry emerged: In Washington state, the leading Republicans in three GOP-held districts were all being held under 50% of the vote in the state\u2019s jungle primary, where Democrats and Republicans compete in the same contest and the top two finishers advance. It could foreshadow trouble for those candidates in the fall. Kobach was in a dead heat with incumbent Gov. Jeff Colyer in the Republican gubernatorial primary there. Johnson County, the heavily populated suburbs of Kansas City, had yet to fully report early into Wednesday morning. There\u2019s still enough outstanding vote left to count there that could determine the outcome of the contest. Its results were likely to swing the race. A loss by Kobach \u2013 who is controversial because he advocates restrictive voting laws and has backed Trump\u2019s false claims of widespread voter fraud \u2013 would be an embarrassment for Trump, who has success at picking winners in GOP primaries this year. But it would be a relief for Republicans who see him as a weaker general election candidate. A Kobach win would underscore Trump\u2019s influence among Republican primary voters. If Colyer wins, he told CNN in an interview Tuesday that some of the credit would belong to former Sen. Bob Dole, who endorsed him. When Missourians gathered more than 300,000 petition signatures to force a referendum on the state\u2019s right-to-work law, Republicans who control the state legislature tried to protect the union-busting law with a maneuver they thought would tip the outcome in their favor. Their move: Put the referendum on the ballot in the August primary, when they expected strong Republican turnout, rather than in the November general election, when they expected pro-union Democrats would show up in full force. It backfired spectacularly. Unions notch win in deep-red Missouri with rejection of right-to-work law Missouri voters rejected the right-to-work law by a 2-to-1 margin \u2013 a remarkable defeat for a Republican priority in a state Trump won by 19 percentage points in 2016. The result was a major victory for labor unions, which invested $16 million in the campaign. It could also mark a turning point in the Midwest, years after Republicans won battles against unions in states like Wisconsin and Indiana. \u201cThe defeat of this poisonous anti-worker legislation is a victory for all workers across the country,\u201d AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka said in a celebratory statement Tuesday night. \u201cThe message sent by every single person who worked to defeat Prop. A is clear: When we see an opportunity to use our political voice to give workers a more level playing field, we will seize it with overwhelming passion and determination.\u201d For progressives hoping for another victory in the mold of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s stunning June ouster of Rep. Joe Crowley, Tuesday was a major letdown. In the night\u2019s marquee contest, progressive outsider Abdul El-Sayed fell well short in his bid to upset former state Senate Minority leader Gretchen Whitmer, who won the nomination at a canter and is now poised for a November showdown with Republican Attorney General Bill Schuette. Ocasio-Cortez and Sen. Bernie Sanders, who defeated Hillary Clinton in the state two years ago and predicted El-Sayed would follow in his path, campaigned for El-Sayed, who ran on an innovative \u201cMedicare for all\u201d plan and the promise of public broadband and tuition-free college. Whitmer painted the 33-year-old doctor\u2019s platform as mostly unrealistic in a state won by Trump in 2016. She also had the backing of New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand and most of the state party establishment. The result means the top of Michigan Democrats\u2019 ticket will feature two women: Whitmer and incumbent Sen. Debbie Stabenow \u2013 another landmark in what\u2019s been a bumper year for female candidates. Keeping with the mixed-bag theme of the night, former state Rep. Rashida Tlaib is projected to win the general election primary to replace former Rep. John Conyers Jr., while Fayrouz Saad lagged far behind in her contest. Both were endorsed by Ocasio-Cortez. Tlaib is on track to become the first Muslim woman in Congress. But there was more progressive heartbreak in Missouri, where activist Cori Bush lost in her bid to unseat Democratic Rep. William Lacy Clay despite a visit and the vocal support of Ocasio-Cortez. It was a split decision in Kansas: labor lawyer Brent Welder failed to beat Sharice Davids in the state\u2019s 3rd District, CNN projects, despite Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez\u2019s support. However, they rallied in July for James Thompson, who won the 4th District primary Tuesday and secured a rematch of his 2017 special election against GOP Rep. Ron Estes. Thompson lost that race by less than 7 points a few months after Republican Mike Pompeo won re-election there by more than 30.",

            "article_content": "It may be the doldrums of August, but there\u2019s a special election tonight in Ohio that could have major ramifications in the battle for the House majority this fall. The race is in Ohio\u2019s 12th District, where state Sen. Troy Balderson, a Republican, is taking on Franklin County Recorder Danny O\u2019Connor. On its face, the district should favor Republicans; Donald Trump and Mitt Romney won it in 2016 and 2012, and Republicans have held it for more than three decades. But all the data suggests this race is really close \u2013 and according to data over the past month, Balderson is holding steady while O\u2019Connor is trending upward.   One House race can\u2019t tell us everything the entire country is thinking \u2013 obviously. (Charlie Cook makes that point here.) But it will tell us something about how both parties\u2019 messages are working and how base enthusiasm is playing out on both sides. Below, four things to watch in tonight\u2019s voting: 1. Nancy Pelosi: The House minority leader has been at the center of Republican attacks in the final days of the race as outside conservative groups seek to link O\u2019Connor with the unpopular California Democrat. O\u2019Connor has fumbled somewhat on the question, struggling to get distance from the minority leader.\u00a0 The GOP\u2019s Pelosi strategy worked like a charm in 2014 and 2010. But has its moment passed? 2.\u00a0The Trump effect: President Trump visited the district on Saturday in an attempt to rally support for Balderson. Trump did the same in the Pennsylvania special election earlier this year but couldn\u2019t save Republican state Rep. Rick Saccone. But Trump has shown an ability to deliver Republican votes in GOP primaries. Can he do the same for Balderson in a general, special election format? 3. Suburbs: This is a suburban district, taking in the affluent suburbs of Columbus. (The median income districtwide is more than $66,000.) In 2016, Trump won suburban areas \u2013 which made up 49% of the overall vote \u2013 by 4 points. That\u2019s in keeping with the suburbs as the central battleground between the two parties. An O\u2019Connor win tonight would suggest the suburbs might be swinging to Democrats. 4. Tax cuts cut who? In the wake of the passage of the Trump tax plan last year, congressional Republicans insisted they would be running hard in the midterms on putting more money in people\u2019s pockets. But it\u2019s Democrats who have seized the tax issue in this race \u2013 arguing that Balderson\u2019s support for the Trump tax cut would contribute to hollowing out Social Security and Medicare. If it works, expect to hear a lot more about the tax cut issue \u2013 from Democrats! \u2013 in November. The Point: This race isn\u2019t the end for the Republican majority if Balderson loses. But it\u2019s a step in the wrong direction. Sign up to get future editions of The Point newsletter delivered to your inbox.",

            "article_content": "The odds are against him. History, too. But if Abdul El-Sayed, in his quest to become the country\u2019s first Muslim governor, can upset frontrunner Gretchen Whitmer in Michigan\u2019s Democratic primary on Tuesday, he will do more than earn his shot at carving out a piece of political history: He will upend the conventional wisdom within the party establishment that says progressive left politics are a loser with Midwestern voters. Michigan Democrats\u2019 race to replace the term-limited Republican Gov. Rick Snyder, one of the few ideologically and personally combative of the season, is a three-way fight featuring former state Senate minority leader Whitmer, the young leftist firebrand El-Sayed and millionaire self-funder Shri Thanedar. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez won in New York. Now her allies are taking on the Midwest. El-Sayed, a 33-year-old former Detroit health commissioner championed by Sen. Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, has emerged as a favorite of the rising progressive insurgency with his detailed pitches for statewide \u201cMedicare for all,\u201d public internet and tuition-free college. But it is Whitmer who enjoys the support of leading Michigan Democratic establishment figures, along with the state\u2019s biggest unions and, as of last week, New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand. A liberal in good standing from her time in the state legislature, Whitmer has pitched herself as the safer hands in this contest, calling El-Sayed\u2019s single-payer plan \u201cnot realistic in Michigan at this moment\u201d while touting her work to help secure a Medicaid expansion deal with Republicans back in 2013. Their most recent and heated tussle has centered on the question of corporate PAC money \u2013 Whitmer accepts it, El-Sayed does not. Over the past few days, he has accused her \u2013 not for the first time \u2013 of being bought off by the state\u2019s largest insurer, while she is charging that his campaign has fallen short of its own standards. The debate turned nasty last Thursday, when El-Sayed in a tweet linking to a Crain\u2019s Detroit Business report on the more than $500,000 in \u201cuntraceable\u201d money given to a political organization that has run ads supporting Whitmer, compared the practice to \u201cmoney laundering.\u201d That language \u2013 deleted and amended to \u201ca legal form of money laundering,\u201d which has also since been erased \u2013 quickly escalated what was already shaping up to be a tense run-in. Early Friday, Whitmer\u2019s campaign zeroed in on filings that showed a PAC run by state Rep. Abdullah Hammoud gave more than $60,000 to El-Sayed\u2019s campaign shortly after receiving a cash infusion from donors who had already given it the individual maximum. A spokeswoman responded to the news by accusing El-Sayed of \u201crunning a potentially illegal donor funneling scheme,\u201d and suggested he had \u201cstooped to the level of Donald Trump by peddling conspiracy theories and making defamatory attacks on Twitter.\u201d (There is no clear evidence that El-Sayed, the donors or Hammoud\u2019s PAC violated campaign finance rules.) El-Sayed sought to take down the temperature later in the day, tweeting that he admired Whitmer\u2019s work and pledged that the two \u201cwill walk in lockstep, whoever wins, to a blue wave in November.\u201d For now, though, El-Sayed and other Whitmer critics are keeping up the charge that her opposition to \u201cMedicare for all\u201d has been influenced by allies at Blue Cross Blue Shield. Executives who run the insurer\u2019s PAC organized a fundraiser for Whitmer earlier year, netting her campaign $144,000. In a recent interview with The Nation, El-Sayed alleged that it \u201cbought her silence on single-payer.\u201d During a canvassing event last week, Whitmer called those attacks \u201cphony,\u201d adding that it was \u201cextremely sexist to say that a woman is beholden to her father\u2019s former employer.\u201d Her father, Richard Whitmer, was the insurer\u2019s chief executive from 1988 to 2006. El-Sayed has steered clear of making a direct connection. Others have been less careful. Whitmer insists she backs \u201cuniversal coverage\u201d but also called it \u201cdeceptive to pretend a governor can count on two waivers from the Trump administration, and a constitutional amendment and a hundred billion dollars.\u201d Asked about that logic, El-Sayed\u2019s campaign said, \u201cSenator Whitmer here clearly shows that Blue Cross Blue Shield has written her talking points on health care.\u201d Though they have mostly focused on each other as the primary nears, both El-Sayed and Whitmer have also been the target of (expensive) broadsides from Thanedar, whose bid appears to be losing steam amid controversies surrounding his business practices and a report that he considered running as a Republican before turning around and pitching himself to Democrats as \u201ca fiscally savvy Bernie.\u201d In an interview last week, El-Sayed compared his campaign to the one Sanders, who sung his praises at a pair of rallies this weekend in Michigan, ran a couple years ago. \u201c(Sanders) inspired people to believe in his message because they knew he wasn\u2019t bought by corporations and he wasn\u2019t proposing halfway measures,\u201d El-Sayed said. \u201cWe\u2019re doing exactly the same thing.\u201d The son of Egyptian immigrants, El-Sayed has also fended off suggestions that, in a state won by President Donald Trump two years ago, he would be at a disadvantage in a general election. His message to the doubters: \u201cBarack Hussein Obama won twice, and Bernie just won his primary, so I\u2019m your best bet if you want to win a primary or a general.\u201d Whitmer\u2019s argument, highlighted by a recurring promise to \u201cFix the damn roads\u201d and reminder she alone among the candidates can stake a claim to expanding health care in the state, is more utilitarian. \u201cMichigan\u2019s not an overwhelmingly extreme left state or extreme right state,\u201d she said in an interview last week. \u201cWe\u2019re a state full of people that just want our government to work.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Democrats in the Kansas City suburbs are set to decide on Tuesday what type of candidate they believe can win in a red state during Donald Trump\u2019s presidency. The House primary in Kansas\u2019 3rd District is a microcosm of the ideological battles playing out in the Democratic Party in House races this year and ahead of the 2020 presidential election, when the same battles will be front and center. It pits a candidate running far to the left against someone trying to appeal to the center. There\u2019s also a woman vying to become the first openly lesbian Native American in Congress. The winner will take on Republican Rep. Kevin Yoder, who represents the district that Hillary Clinton won by 1 point in 2016. The Democratic primary is a six-way free-for-all. Democrats say they believe at least three candidates have a shot at winning \u2013 and they have no idea who\u2019s ahead. On the left is labor lawyer Brent Welder, who rallied recently with Vermont\u2019s independent Sen. Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Welder has campaigned for single-payer \u201cMedicare for all\u201d health insurance, a $15-an-hour minimum wage and other progressive priorities. \u201cYou have to convince them and you have to be honest about a progressive, populist economic platform, so that they don\u2019t get lured away by right-wing social wedge issues like they did by Donald Trump,\u201d Welder said in an interview. \u201cAnd I think the Democratic Party for far too long has been straying from a bold, populist economic message. That\u2019s the reason we keep losing.\u201d Welder told The Guardian last year that he had \u201cstruggled\u201d to vote for Clinton in 2016 and considered backing the Green Party\u2019s Jill Stein. He was an early adopter of a rule that\u2019s become popular with Democrats angling to run for president in 2020: eschewing corporate political action committee donations. Still, he said, the money has poured in, including $225,000 in July with an average donation of $18.58. Ask Welder which types of voters Democrats must win in order to oust Yoder, and he points to those who backed President Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012 but then voted for Trump in 2016. Another candidate, high school teacher Tom Niermann, offers the opposite take. In an interview, he said Democrats\u2019 road to victory is through moderate suburbanites \u2013 people who voted for Mitt Romney in 2012 and Hillary Clinton in 2016. There are plenty of them: Romney won the district by 10 points in 2012, while Clinton won it by 1 point in 2016. \u201cThey\u2019re pretty centrist in their positions,\u201d Niermann said of voters in the district. \u201cThey have a great value that they place on good government that is responsive to the needs of people in the community.\u201d His positions are similar to Welder\u2019s, but Niermann says that while he supports Medicare for all conceptually and as a long-term solution, he favors bipartisan efforts to reduce health care costs in the short term and with a divided Washington. Niermann is touting his lengthy ties to the area, including local officials\u2019 endorsements. As a teacher, he could capitalize on this spring\u2019s protests over education funding. He has told personal stories about his wife being denied insurance because of a pre-existing condition. Campaigning for gun control measures, Niermann has pointed out that he once had a gun brought into his classroom and that two of his students were killed as a result of gun violence. SNEAK PEAK: this teacher is running for Congress because over 20 years ago he lost two students to gun violence and had a gun brought into his classroom. Today, nothing has changed. Check out Tom Niermann's first TV ad about the need for common sense gun reform now. \u2b07\ufe0f\u2b07\ufe0f\u2b07\ufe0f pic.twitter.com/4hBxLPCVny Niermann highlighting his local ties is an implicit contrast with Welder, who moved to Kansas from St. Louis last year. Welder has pointed out that his wife is from the district and he helped Sanders\u2019 2016 campaign organize there. Then there\u2019s the clear trend in Democratic primaries this year: Women are winning the vast majority of competitive races. If that trend extends to Kansas, the likely beneficiary would be Sharice Davids \u2013 a former White House fellow and former professional mixed martial arts fighter who will become the first openly lesbian Native American in Congress if she wins in November. Davids, like Niermann, has staked out more moderate positions than Welder. But she is the beneficiary of $400,000 in television advertising from EMILY\u2019s List, a group that backs Democratic women running for political office. Davids said she \u201ccan appreciate this national dialogue that\u2019s going on\u201d as Democratic women emerge from competitive primaries. \u201cPeople are winning when they\u2019re connecting with people. And I\u2019m definitely trying to make sure I do that,\u201d she said. With limited public polling in the race, it\u2019s not clear who leads heading into Tuesday\u2019s primary. Further complicating the campaign is that businesswoman Sylvia Williams is spending her own money on a late television advertising push \u2013 making her a wild card, too. A national Democratic operative working on House races said the party believes Yoder remains vulnerable no matter who emerges from Tuesday\u2019s primary.",

O\u2019Connor\u2019s ad, an upbeat and positive spot, features the young candidate speaking straight to the camera about the need to change leaders in Washington. The ad highlights O\u2019Connor\u2019s attempts to distance himself from Pelosi, a tactic that a number of Democrats running in historically Republican districts are taking in response to the national Democratic figure. \u201cThe same old politics in Washington just aren\u2019t working. Democrats and Republicans are at each other\u2019s throats every day, leaving the issues that matter most to your family behind,\u201d O\u2019Connor says. \u201cWe need new leadership in both parties.\u201d He adds: \u201cInstead of corporate giveaways that pile up debt, let\u2019s cut taxes for working people, let\u2019s fight back against drug and insurance company greed, let\u2019s protect every dime of the Social Security and Medicare benefits seniors have earned.\u201d Democratic operatives working on the race said the closing argument ad is meant to contrast O\u2019Connor\u2019s positive messaging with Balderson\u2019s use of attack ads. \u201cDanny is doing something different,\u201d said one operative. \u201cThis ad is designed to cut through the noise.\u201d Top Democratic groups launch new push in final two weeks of Ohio special election That noise is the string of negative headlines about O\u2019Connor\u2019s answer during an MSNBC interview last week, where host Chris Matthews pushed the candidate on his opposition to Pelosi. The back-and-forth eventually led O\u2019Connor to say he \u201cwould support whoever the Democrats put forward\u201d on the House floor. O\u2019Connor has made his opposition to Pelosi central to his campaign, including highlighting it in his first TV ad. Republicans were quick to highlight O\u2019Connor\u2019s answer. \u201cAfter last night\u2019s pathetic interview by Danny O\u2019Connor, Democrats\u2019 talking points disavowing Nancy Pelosi are as flimsy as the paper they\u2019re written on,\u201d said Matt Gorman, communications director for the National Republican Congressional Committee. \u201cOnce you get them beyond a noun, a verb and \u2018new leadership,\u2019 they fold like a cheap suit.\u201d O\u2019Connor stood by his opposition to Pelosi \u2013 \u201cNo DC-style gotcha politics will change my resolve,\u201d he told CNN \u2013 and his aides argued that it is highly unlikely Democrats would put Pelosi forward after November\u2019s election if she didn\u2019t have the votes from her caucus. Republicans are closing the race with a mix of messages. The Congressional Leadership Fund, a super PAC tied to House leadership that has spent $2.6 million on ads in this race, released an ad on Tuesday highlighting Kasich\u2019s support for Balderson. Kasich, before becoming governor and running for president, represented the suburban Columbus district for 18 years. \u201cOn August 7, we\u2019re going to elect a new member of Congress. Troy Balderson was a partner of mine as a member of the Ohio Legislature and he helped in cutting taxes and turning Ohio around,\u201d Kasich says in the straight-to-camera ad. \u201cTroy shares our common-sense values on important issues that face us today. Troy Balderson has my vote.\u201d Kaisch held out on supporting Balderson for months and didn\u2019t make an official endorsement until last week. The lack of endorsement created an awkward tension, especially considering Balderson was tying himself to Trump, a Republican whom Kasich has publicly criticized. \u201cI don\u2019t know that it helps a lot,\u201d Balderson said of Kasich\u2019s endorsement in an interview with CNN earlier this month. \u201cThere are different areas that Gov. Kasich is well received, but I got to run on Troy Balderson.\u201d The ad is meant to cut into O\u2019Connor\u2019s outreach to Kasich voters, a pitch he has made both in person and with a television ad. \u201cThis really hurts O\u2019Connor,\u201d said a Republican operative familiar with the strategy. \u201cThese are directed at the people he is trying to court.\u201d In another example of the push and pull for Balderson in the race, his campaign highlighted his support from Trump on the same day the super PAC released its Kasich ad. \u201cWow \u2013 it\u2019s a huge honor to have President Donald Trump come out so strong in support of my campaign,\u201d Balderson said in a fundraising email to supporters. \u201cThe Commander-in-Chief needs more Trump Republicans in Congress who will support his America-First agenda, and I\u2019m ready and willing to help.\u201d Although Republicans jumped on O\u2019Connor\u2019s answer to the Pelosi question in the press, the National Republican Congressional Committee has yet to put money behind the exchange with a TV ad. The committee, for example, began airing an ad on Tuesday that attacks O\u2019Connor for supporting regulations that could increase energy prices, targeting senior voters. \u201cDanny O\u2019Connor doesn\u2019t understand what it is like for folks like us,\u201d a senior citizen couple says in the spot airing in Columbus. \u201cO\u2019Connor supports regulations that could raise my energy costs 39%.\u201d Not mentioned once in Republican ads: O\u2019Connor\u2019s muddled answer on Pelosi. Republicans have also not made defending the Republican-backed tax overhaul a central part of their closing message, despite the fact that national operatives have stressed the need for campaigns to sell the measure, which passed in December.",

            "article_content": "President Trump claimed credit for the strong economic growth numbers released on Friday morning, attributing them to his administration\u2019s actions on taxes, trade, and regulations. The economy did grow at a 4.1% annual pace in the second quarter, the best in four years. But most of the statistics that Trump cited as evidence of \u201can economic turnaround of historic proportions\u201d require context to be fully understood. For example, economic growth has topped 4% in four other quarters since 2009. And Trump\u2019s claim that \u201cwe\u2019re going to go a lot higher than these numbers\u201d conflicts with the predictions of most bank and Federal Reserve economists, who forecast that growth will slow in 2019 and 2020. \u201cThis is not sustainable,\u201d said KC Mathews, chief investment officer at Kansas City-based UMB Bank. \u201cMaybe we get a soft landing. Growth will slow, but we may not have a recession. Growth could go back to about a 2% to 2.5% level.\u201d To help put it all in perspective, here\u2019s the context on some of the other economic data points Trump cited. By Lydia DePillis Trump has been touting that economic growth will continue to be strong throughout his presidency. \u201cWe are on track to meet the highest annual growth rate in over 13 years. During each of the two previous administrations, we averaged just over 1.8% GDP growth. By contrast, we are now on track to hit an average GDP annual growth of over 3%, and it could be substantially over 3%.\u201d Related: How the US economy is doing now \u2013 in four charts The average of the annual real growth rates of the past two administrations was 1.9%. That included several years that covered the worst economic downturn since the Great Depression. It is true that many economists are projecting the economy will grow by 3% in 2018. That would be the highest since 2005, when the economy grew by 3.5%. By Lydia DePillis Trump claimed that unemployment has reached record lows for black, Hispanic and Asian Americans and for Americans with disabilities. He also said that the unemployment rate for women is the lowest in 65 years, and that veteran unemployment is the lowest in 18 years. Those numbers are all correct. But they have been falling fairly consistently since 2010. Also, there weren\u2019t many women out looking for jobs in 1953, the last time unemployment for women was 3.6%, as it was in May. More broadly, unemployment and economic growth are not the only ways to measure the well-being of households. Another important element, worker pay, has been flat over the past year by some measures, such as real average hourly wages for rank-and-file workers. By others, such as Sentier Research\u2019s median household income index, which takes into account all forms of income such as dividends and Social Security payments, it has risen. By Katie Lobosco Trump touted the number of jobs created since he won the presidency. \u201cWe have added 3.7 million new jobs since the election. A number that is unthinkable if you go back to the campaign. Nobody would have said it. Nobody would have even in an optimistic way projected it. We are in the midst of the longest positive job growth streak in history.\u201d The economy has indeed added 3.7 million jobs since November 2016. June was the 93rd straight month of gains, which is the longest on record. But the economy is cranking out jobs at a slower pace than it was before Trump was elected. The United States added 2.7 million jobs in 2015 and 2.3 million in 2016. It added 2.2 million last year and is on pace for 2.6 million this year. By Tami Luhby Trump touted that his economic turnaround has helped millions of people leave the food stamp program. \u201cMore than 3.5 million Americans have been lifted off food stamps, something that you haven\u2019t seen in decades,\u201d Trump said, noting that before he took office, more than 10 million Americans had signed up. \u201cThat\u2019s because they are able to go out and get a job.\u201d It\u2019s true that the food stamp program\u2019s numbers ballooned in the wake of the Great Recession. Enrollment peaked at 47.6 million in 2013, up from 28.2 million in 2008. Since Trump\u2019s inauguration in January 2017, the rolls have shrunk by just over 3 million, according to US Department of Agriculture data. Some 39.6 million Americans received food stamps as of April, the latest figures available. But the decline predated Trump\u2019s presidency. Enrollment dropped by 3.5 million between 2013 and 2016. Certainly, the strong job market has helped more people become self-sufficient. But policy changes have also contributed. Related: States aren\u2019t waiting for Washington to require poor residents to work Adults ages 18 to 49 who aren\u2019t disabled and don\u2019t have dependent children can only receive food stamps for three months unless they work at least 20 hours a week. Many states waived this provision during the economic downturn, but started reimposing it in recent years as the job market improved. This change may have forced up to 1 million people off the rolls in 2016, according to an estimate at the time by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a left-leaning group. More states, including Kentucky, West Virginia and Tennessee, have reinstated the time limit in some or all of their counties since Trump took office. By Tami Luhby Trump took the opportunity to blast Obamacare during his speech on the economy. \u201cWe have also liberated millions of Americans from the crushing burdens of Obamacare,\u201d he said. \u201cThe cruel individual mandate penalty is gone \u2026 And Obamacare is now on its last legs, fortunately.\u201d Not quite. Congress did eliminate the penalty associated with the individual mandate, which requires nearly all Americans to have health insurance, as part of its 2017 tax reform bill. But that doesn\u2019t take effect until next year. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that the number of uninsured will rise by 3 million in 2019 because of this provision. Meanwhile, enrollment in Affordable Care Act plans has remained fairly steady. The number of people signing up for 2019 plans during open enrollment dipped 3.8% to nearly 11.8 million, according to the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services. But the number of people who actually enrolled \u2013 meaning they paid their first month\u2019s premium \u2013 rose by about 3% to 10.6 million, as of mid-March, the agency said. Related: Insurers aren\u2019t running scared from Obamacare anymore Also, Obamacare is enjoying a resurgence among insurers for 2019. Carriers are entering or returning to at least a dozen states, while others are expanding their presence in the states in which they operate. This is quite a turnaround from a year ago, when insurers were fleeing the Affordable Care Act exchanges, worried about the law\u2019s uncertain future with Republicans in control of the White House and Congress. Related: Obamacare sign ups remain strong in 2018, but next year remains uncertain By Tami Luhby The nation has gotten richer since Trump took office, a point he noted in his speech Friday. \u201cSince I was elected we\u2019ve created approximately $7 trillion of new wealth,\u201d he said. It\u2019s true the nation\u2019s net worth has grown by about that amount, according to the Federal Reserve. It rose to $101 trillion in the first quarter, up from $94 trillion in the same period a year earlier, when Trump took office. (The gain shrinks to just under $5 trillion if you adjust the figures for inflation.) However, the country was getting wealthier long before Trump\u2019s presidency. After taking a beating during the Great Recession, net worth rocketed back. It rose by nearly $40 trillion during the eight years of Barack Obama\u2019s presidency, or $31 trillion when adjusted for inflation. Related: Millions of Americans can\u2019t feel the stock market boom The booming stock market and rising real estate values contributed to the growth in wealth for both Obama\u2019s and Trump\u2019s presidencies. Not everyone is sharing in the wealth boom, however. Only 54% of Americans have money invested in the stock market, according a Gallup survey from the spring of 2017. By Lydia DePillis Trump says it\u2019s booming. \u201cThe year before I came into office, private business investment grew at only 1.8%. Last year it jumped to 6.3%. This year it\u2019s growing at 9.4%. That\u2019s a very tremendous increase. There hasn\u2019t been an increase like that in many many years, decades.\u201d Trump appears to be referring to real private non-residential investment \u2014 the money that businesses spend on things like commercial construction, tools and machinery. His advisers have called this a key goal of the tax cuts. When businesses upgrade their equipment, they say, they can raise worker productivity and justify paying more. The White House\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers published a brief walking through the numbers. Weak investment in 2016 mostly had to do with an enormous drop in oil and gas drilling, and the rebound in 2017 came mostly because of that sector\u2019s recovery. But you don\u2019t have to go back very far to get a similar growth rate. Real non-residential fixed investment grew by 9.5% in 2012 from the previous year. By Katie Lobosco Trump praised Republicans in Congress for cutting taxes. As a result, he said, \u201csix million Americans are now enjoying new bonuses, better jobs and far bigger paychecks.\u201d Hundreds of companies cited the tax cuts when they announced bonuses, wage increases and new employee perks this year. Walmart, Bank of America, and American Airlines were among the companies that handed out bonuses. Still, six million employees represents less than 5% of the private sector work force. And for most of those workers, the benefit will be short-lived because it came as a one-time bonus or additional contribution to 401(k) plans. Shareholders have received a much bigger benefit from the new tax law. Companies have announced hundreds of billions of dollars in stock buybacks since their taxes were cut. By Tami Luhby Trump boasted about the decline in the trade deficit in the most recent quarter. \u201cPerhaps one of the biggest wins in the report, and it is indeed a big one, is that the trade deficit \u2013 very dear to my heart because we\u2019ve been ripped off by the world \u2013 has dropped by more than $50 billion. $52 billion to be exact,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s a tremendous drop. We haven\u2019t had a drop like that in a long time.\u201d Yes, the trade deficit narrowed from $902 billion in the first quarter of 2018 to $850 billion in the second quarter. But the deficit in the first quarter was also the largest it\u2019s been since 2006, according to the Bureau of Economic Analysis. Even now, the trade deficit remains slightly higher than it was when Trump took office. It came in at $845.5 billion in the first quarter of last year. Additional reporting by Paul La Monica",

            "article_content": "A trio of Democratic groups are wading into the upcoming Ohio 12th Congressional District special election with a joint advertising and field campaign, part of a rush of Democratic engagement in the last two weeks of a contest that will serve as a key test ahead of the 2018 midterms. The three groups \u2013 House Majority PAC, Priorities USA Action and For Our Future \u2013 announced Wednesday the launch of a \u201cjoint $140,000 investment in a digital and field campaign\u201d aimed at bolstering Democrat Danny O\u2019Connor against Republican state Sen. Troy Balderson in the race for former Republican Rep. Pat Tiberi\u2019s seat. RELATED: Outside money pours into Ohio special election The organizations say the initiative will run through Election Day on August 7, with Priorities USA helming the digital ad campaign and For Our Future leading canvassing and get-out-the-vote efforts. One of the digital video ads, \u201cSimple,\u201d hammers Balderson for the tax legislation congressional Republicans passed in late 2017. \u201cTroy Balderson supported a massive tax giveaway to corporate special interests \u2013 and you pay for it,\u201d a narrator says in the spot before listing concerns about the national debt, welfare programs and the possibility of higher future taxes. \u201cIt\u2019s simple: Troy Balderson will cost you more.\u201d The ads will run on Facebook, Pandora, Spotify, YouTube and Google. The groups plan to combine advertising and going door to door, with the goal of knocking on 25,000 doors. House Majority PAC director Charlie Kelly hailed the joint initiative in a statement: \u201cHouse Majority PAC is proud to partner with Priorities USA Action and For Our Future \u2013 investing both in field and a range of new media platforms to go on offense in this red district. From front doors to digital platforms, we\u2019re going to make sure voters know Balderson sure doesn\u2019t stand with them on the critical kitchen table issues defining this election and would cost them more.\u201d The new campaign tracks with escalating Democratic activity in the 12th District special election, a race that\u2019s been dominated by Republican money for months. Outside groups have spent over $4 million on the race, most of it coming from GOP organizations, due in part to a competitive primary on the Republican side. The Congressional Leadership Fund, a leading GOP super PAC targeting US House races, has spent nearly $2 million on the race alone, according to Federal Election Commission filings. Democrats are banking that the enthusiasm of their base this election cycle, coupled with effective messaging against President Donald Trump\u2019s economic policies, will be enough to flip the district that Tiberi, who left office earlier this year to lead the Ohio Business Roundtable, had represented since 2001. CNN has rated the race \u201clean Republican.\u201d Last week, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee \u2013 House Democrats\u2019 principal campaign arm \u2013 dropped $238,000 on a 10-day ad campaign running through next Monday. And the expectation is that the committee will buy more airtime to run pro-O\u2019Connor spots through Election Day. Like the video featured in the new campaign from the Democratic groups, the committee\u2019s ad targets Republicans\u2019 tax plan. \u201cBalderson supports a massive corporate tax break that helps rack up $2 trillion in debt. And what will that mean for us? Balderson\u2019s plan could mean cuts for Medicare and Social Security,\u201d warns a narrator in the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee spot. Josh Schwerin, communications director for Priorities USA Action \u2013 one of the three groups involved in the new campaign \u2013 spoke to Democrats\u2019 confidence in attacking the GOP tax cuts in the midterm elections, a tack that\u2019s been a big part of the party\u2019s messaging in the Ohio special election. \u201cRepublicans promised thousands of dollars to every American family and a political silver bullet. The actual result has been lower wages and a ballooning deficit that Republicans want to use as an excuse to cut Medicare and Social Security. There isn\u2019t a district in America where we\u2019d be remotely worried about running ads highlighting the damage the Republican tax law is doing to the country,\u201d Schwerin told CNN. An O\u2019Connor win in this pink district would be a shot in the arm for Democrats concerned about the party\u2019s recent losses in the industrial Midwest, epitomized by Trump\u2019s 2016 victory in Ohio. The recent commitment of resources to the 12th District special election suggests the party thinks it has a real shot.",

            "article_content": "Ben Jealous, a former NAACP leader endorsed by Bernie Sanders, moved a step closer to becoming the next governor of Maryland by winning the Democratic primary in the state governor\u2019s race. After prevailing in a crowded primary field, Jealous is now set to face off against Maryland\u2019s popular Republican Gov. Larry Hogan in the November general election. If he wins, Jealous would become Maryland\u2019s first African-American governor. Jealous has embraced progressive policy ides while campaigning, like implementing a Medicare-For-All universal health care system in the state and legalizing marijuana. He\u2019s also emphasized his background as a civil rights leader. His platform championed police reform and called for working to \u201cend the era of mass incarceration\u201d by striving for a fair criminal justice system.\u2019 On Wednesday, Jealous told CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer that he won the primary by campaigning \u201call across the state,\u201d talking to voters about how to solve issues such as \u201chow we make sure that our schools are fully funded, how we make sure that we truly get health care costs under control, how we get our public universities to be affordable again and we find the money to do that by ending mass incarceration.\u201d Sanders celebrated the primary win on Tuesday, saying in a statement that \u201cthere are few progressives stronger than Ben\u201d and arguing that the outcome of the race \u201cshowed that running a progressive, issue-oriented campaign can bring all working people together.\u201d Jealous, for his part, also endorsed Sanders during his 2016 presidential run. Other potential 2020 Democratic presidential contenders, including progressive Sens. Kamala Harris and Cory Booker, endorsed Jealous in his primary bid as well. But Jealous is likely to face a challenging race in the general election given that Hogan enjoys a high degree of popularity in the state. \u201cHogan is in the strongest possible position you can be in for a Republican governor in a blue state in the time of Trump,\u201d Mileah Kromer, an associate professor of political science at Goucher College said in an interview. \u201cBut that being said, it\u2019s also a blue state.\u201d \u201cThese big, high-profile endorsements have shone a spotlight on the campaign and what that suggests to me is that Jealous is going to be able to raise money because of the national attention,\u201d she said. A key question to watch in the general election, Kromer added, is whether \u201cJealous will try to break apart the Hogan coalition by attempting to appeal at least somewhat to moderate Democrats or if he will focus on increasing turnout among progressives.\u201d",

            "article_content": "There is no more durable feature of Democratic politics than the ritual agonizing over the party\u2019s inability to organize itself around a coherent message. In 2018, the most prevalent argument among liberal pundits turns on whether it\u2019s a better electoral strategy to target President Donald Trump and his administration or bear down on core economic issues. But the reality, as we\u2019ve seen throughout the campaign, is that both are happening. The challenge for party leadership and individual candidates now is more delicate, as they try to tie the two together \u2013 and get voters to pay attention. Democrats rip Trump over failed 'swamp' cleaning, promise a 'better' plan Even within that tricky new paradigm, there is a clear consensus around at least one matter: health care. In speeches, debates and ads, Democrats from across the party\u2019s ideological spectrum are describing efforts to defend and expand coverage and care as a moral imperative. From the rumored 2020 presidential challengers in the Senate to midterm candidates up and down the ballot, in both red and blue states and districts, the future of health care in America is shaping up as perhaps the central policy concern of 2018. The contours of the candidates\u2019 messages might vary and, for many, the particulars of the path forward \u2013 how far, how fast \u2013 remain an open question. But there is little question, for Democrats in this cycle, which way is up. Capitol Hill, despite being home to a pair of Republican majorities, has become a stage for Democrats who, in less than two years, have rolled out at least five significant proposals for big ticket expansions of government-backed health care. That the legislation is dead on arrival in Trump\u2019s Washington is beside the point. These are statements of intent and appeals to current and future voters. On the trail this year, candidates have swung at the issue from all angles. A scan of ads from congressional hopefuls reveals a diverse suite of tactics buttressed by a clear strategic decision to hammer Republicans over their efforts to gut Obamacare and either cut or complicate funding for programs like Medicaid. In California\u2019s 48th District, Harley Rouda, a businessman who registered as a Democrat only after the 2016 election, now has the support of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee; Indivisible, the grass-roots liberal group; and the union activists from the California Nurses Association/National Nurses United. It\u2019s an unusual combination \u2013 one that wouldn\u2019t have been possible, in all likelihood, without his early support for single-payer health care. \u201cWhen I talk about \u2018Medicare for all,\u2019 I can provide the economic rationale and logic, the foundation as to why it makes good business sense,\u201d Rouda said last month, explaining how his pitch will play in wealthy Orange County, \u201cand be credible in that since I\u2019ve had the privilege of managing companies of almost 10,000 people.\u201d Rouda\u2019s assessment of the national political scene is similar to the one informing radical progressives, while jibing with polls that show health care at or near the top of voters\u2019 minds. \u201cThe country is certainly coming around to how important the ACA has been,\u201d he said, citing the backlash to the GOP\u2019s failed attempts to repeal the Affordable Care Act in 2017 and subsequent efforts to undermine it. \u201cWhen people realized what the impact would be if it was terminated, they actually stopped and paused and said, \u2018Wait a minute, maybe this is better than we thought?\u2019 And the fact is, it hasn\u2019t gone far enough.\u201d That push \u2013 further! \u2013 is a recurring theme in Democratic campaign communications around the country, even among candidates fighting to flip their desired seats in red or swing states and districts. Angie Craig, in Minnesota\u2019s 2nd Congressional District, wants \u201cimmediate fixes to the Affordable Care Act, and work toward universal health coverage.\u201d Arizona\u2019s Democratic Rep. Kyrsten Sinema, who\u2019s running to replace the retiring GOP Sen. Jeff Flake, said in a recent ad that she wanted to \u201cfix what\u2019s broken in the system,\u201d rather than blow it up. Others are even more direct \u2013 and ambitious. In Nevada\u2019s 4th District, currently held by Democrats, Amy Vilela called her daughter Shalynne, who died in 2015 after her medical treatment was compromised \u2013 as Vilela alleges \u2013 by insurance issues, \u201ca victim of our for-profit health care system.\u201d \u201cI know what it\u2019s like to have to pay the ultimate price because we have politicians that are not interested in putting the needs of the people first,\u201d Vilela says in an ad. Her primary opponent, Steven Horsford, asks on his website, \u201cDo you have a health care story? Share it with Steven here.\u201d He then spells out a three-step plan to take on \u201cgreedy pharmaceutical companies\u201d and drive down prescription drug prices. Meanwhile, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee hit GOP Rep. Will Hurd, whose seat in Texas\u2019 23rd District could be the state\u2019s most hotly contested, with an ominous, 60-second radio spot that asks at one point \u201cwhat Hurd might do next to your health care?\u201d (Hurd, noting the danger, was one of the few Republicans who voted against the House Obamacare replacement bill.) \u201cYour congressman, Will Hurd, hasn\u2019t stopped trying to repeal your health care,\u201d the narrator says, as if to remind voters of the anger they felt toward the GOP majority in the midst of the Obamacare fight and, later on, when Republicans voted to repeal the individual mandate as part of their tax cut package. In Kentucky\u2019s 6th District, Amy McGrath began an ad by explaining that her decision to \u201cretire from the Marines\u201d and enter the race was due, in part, to incumbent Republican \u201cAndy Barr, Mitch McConnell\u2019s handpicked congressman, saying he would vote \u2018enthusiastically\u2019 to take health care away from over a quarter million Kentuckians.\u201d McGrath won her primary last week and is slated for a face-off with Barr in November. In Pennsylvania, Conor Lamb talked about \u201cunion rights\u201d and taking action to strengthen Obamacare and its insurance markets on his way to victory in a March special election for the state\u2019s 18th Congressional District. \u201cPaul Ryan will use the term \u2018entitlement reform\u2019 to talk about Social Security and Medicare as if it\u2019s undeserved or it\u2019s some form of welfare,\u201d he said in an ad. \u201cBut it\u2019s not any of those things. People paid for it. They worked hard for it and they expect us to keep our promises to them.\u201d It\u2019s not the way a liberal candidate in the Northeast or on the West Coast might have put it, but for a party that has, for decades, bent over backward to reject the idea it\u2019s anything less than fiscally upright, that kind of language from a red district Democrat can be bracing. Lamb, who was tapped by the state party ahead of the special election and ultimately ran unopposed in his new district\u2019s 2018 primary, wasn\u2019t pushed left by an insurgent candidate or activist uproar. He got there on his own \u2013 and he\u2019s still hammering away. \u201cRepublicans in Congress spent the past year trying to take health insurance away from people with no plan to replace it,\u201d it says on his website, which ties coming rate hikes to \u201ca failure of leadership\u201d by the GOP. For fellow Democrats plotting a similar route, from the deepest of blue districts to once-solid Republican redoubts like Lamb\u2019s, the power of that message could make or break their drive to wrest back power in Washington and beyond.",

            "article_content": "On Tuesday morning, Jeff Weaver, who managed Bernie Sanders\u2019 2016 presidential campaign, said this to C-SPAN\u2019s John McArdle about the possibility of a rerun by the Vermont socialist in 2020: \u201cHe is considering another run for the presidency and when the time comes I think we\u2019ll have an answer for that. But right now he\u2019s still considering it.\u201d That\u2019s both a) not terribly surprising and b) extremely important. Not surprising in that Sanders has never really stopped running a national campaign since his primary loss to Hillary Clinton in 2016. Extremely important in that Sanders is \u2013 and is likely to remain \u2013 the prime mover in the Democratic presidential field. That\u2019s not to say Sanders is the current frontrunner for the nomination. He\u2019s not. Former Vice President Joe Biden is \u2013 as CNN\u2019s Harry Enten argues convincingly here. What Sanders\u2019 status as the prime mover in the race means is that he will set the terms on which the race is likely to be fought. He will set the margins \u2013 in terms of policy \u2013 for what Democrats are willing to say and do. He will be the person who the race revolves around \u2013 either in agreement with or reaction to. It\u2019s already been happening. Earlier this month in a speech at the Brookings Institute, Biden used Sanders as a foil \u2013 promising an alternate vision for both the problem and the solution to what ails the country. Here\u2019s the key bit from Biden:\u00a0\u201cI love Bernie, but I\u2019m not Bernie Sanders. I don\u2019t think 500 billionaires are the reason we\u2019re in trouble. The folks at the top aren\u2019t bad guys. But this gap is yawning, and it\u2019s having the effect of pulling us apart. You see the politics of it.\u201d And, following the 2016 election, a parade of would-be 2020 aspirants \u2013 Cory Booker, Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris, Kirsten Gillibrand \u2013\u00a0 signed onto Sanders\u2019 \u201cMedicare For All\u201d single-payer health care proposal. It\u2019s a role he played in 2016, albeit a somewhat unlikely one. Clinton, once she realized that Sanders posed a real threat to her chances, moved hard left on virtually every issue \u2013 ensuring there was no space between her and the Vermont senator. The Point: Watch where Sanders chooses to make moves \u2013 on both policy and politics \u2013 in the coming months. And, as importantly, who follows and who chooses not to.

Bernie Sanders announced Monday he will seek re-election this year, with a formal kickoff in June as he angles for a third term. \u201cThe 2018 midterm elections will be a pivotal moment in our country\u2019s history, and we must fight for an agenda that works for working people,\u201d Sanders said in a statement. Following his insurgent but ultimately unsuccessful bid to capture the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination, Sanders has used his increased influence to champion his preferred policies and argue in favor of reshaping the Democratic Party in a more progressive direction, explicitly opposed to corporate influence and interests. In his statement, Sanders listed off a slew of priorities he has publicly championed, including a national minimum wage of $15 an hour, a \u201cMedicare for all single payer program\u201d and free tuition at public colleges. Sanders, an independent senator who caucuses with the Democrats, won his bid for Senate in 2006 and re-election in 2012 by overwhelming margins, according to the Vermont secretary of state\u2019s election archive. Sanders, 76, was named to a leadership position among Senate Democrats after the party\u2019s losses in the 2016 election.",

            "article_content": "A progressive group is going after the Republican-backed tax law with a new, six-figure ad campaign in Nevada, a key state in the 2018 midterm elections. The Tax March, a nonprofit group affiliated with the \u201cNot One Penny\u201d progressive coalition, says they will spend around $500,000 on the ad campaign in the Las Vegas media market. The new spot, \u201cRigged,\u201d features a pair of children playing the popular \u201cclaw\u201d arcade game and struggling to pick up any cash from the machine. Next, a wealthy-looking man plays and wins easily, walking away with a bag full of money. \u201cBoondoggle. Unfair. A tax cut for the rich. That\u2019s what they\u2019re calling the new tax plan out of Washington. 83% of the benefits go to the richest 1%,\u201d a narrator says. \u201cIt adds $1.9 trillion to our national debt, which may force cuts to Medicare and Social Security. A tax plan for the rich. We pay the price.\u201d IRS rules prevent the group from intervening directly or indirectly in political campaigns on behalf of (or in opposition to) specific candidates. But several key federal races are taking shape in Nevada. Sen. Dean Heller is the most vulnerable incumbent Republican senator in the fall, and there are competitive open House races in the state\u2019s 3rd and 4th congressional districts. The Nevada spending tracks with the Not One Penny coalition\u2019s stated goal of spending up to $5 million this cycle. The group made a similar expenditure in Arizona, hitting the tax law in the Phoenix media market in the midst of a competitive special election in the state\u2019s 8th District last month. The group also released two digital ads hitting the tax law tied to two Republican candidates, Reps. Brian Fitzpatrick in Pennsylvania and Tom MacArthur in New Jersey.",

            "article_content": "A little more than 15 months ago, Democratic businessman Harley Rouda would have seemed like an odd choice to help lead the so-called resistance against President Donald Trump. But a lot has changed since Trump\u2019s victory \u2013 starting with Rouda\u2019s party affiliation. A Republican until 1997, Rouda spent the next two decades as an independent. He and his wife donated to longtime family friend, Ohio Gov. John Kasich, during the Republican nominating contest. Rouda registered as a Democrat shortly after the 2016 election (he voted for Hillary Clinton, former President Barack Obama twice and Democratic nominee John Kerry before that, he said). Then, in March 2017, Rouda entered the congressional primary in his adopted home, California\u2019s 48th Congressional District, where Republican Rep. Dana Rohrabacher is the incumbent. He grabbed the attention of local activists with his early support of \u201cMedicare for All,\u201d which helped him win the twin endorsements of the California Nurses Association and National Nurses United, organizations best known politically for their close alliance with Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. On Wednesday, Rouda will get another boost when Indivisible \u2013 the influential anti-Trump resistance group \u2013 endorses him, a booming bat signal to Democrats ahead of June\u2019s \u201cjungle primary,\u201d which advances the top two vote-getters regardless of party affiliation. The support of Indivisible, which in less than two years has become one of the country\u2019s leading grassroots progressive organizations, confirms the Ohio-born Rouda as the Democratic favorite in the district, which like so many others in the deep blue state was initially inundated with enthusiastic, tenderfoot candidates \u2013 enough that Democrats in other races still risk splitting their primary support, effectively canceling each other out, and inadvertently clearing the way for two Republicans onto the general election ballot. With Indivisible\u2019s backing, Rouda moves to the forefront of a new wave of Democratic activism which has largely sought to cultivate a more ideologically progressive \u2014 and geographically diverse \u2013 slate of candidates heading into the midterm season. \u201cThey do a better job than anyone else out there helping to provide talking points in how to properly position progressive issues. I think Our Revolution does a good job, as well,\u201d Rouda said, also making note of the Sanders-inspired political organization, which has not endorsed in the race. \u201cYou know, the mainstream Democratic Party has not been as aggressive in that language and those talking points, but that\u2019s from a sense of caution and wanting to make sure they\u2019re not pushing certain voter segments away.\u201d \u201cAt that time (I entered), the Democratic Party was telling candidates not to be that forthright. Don\u2019t say \u2018Medicare for all,\u2019 say \u2018universal health care,\u201d Rouda recalled. Mar\u00eda Urbina, Indivisible\u2019s national political director, is the more seasoned operative charged with the delicate work of helping direct and advise the project\u2019s independently run local outposts. California\u2019s 48th district will, after Wednesday\u2019s round of endorsements are rolled out, be home to one of 15 contests with nationally backed Indivisible candidates. Those hopefuls won\u2019t receive a direct cash infusion, but the group\u2019s stamp of approval \u2013 as voted on by its members \u2013 is expected to key up individual donations and activist energy around the campaigns. \u201cOne of the things we ask after you vote (to endorse nationally) is would you be willing to volunteer, and we build out that volunteer list, which is really one of the key features of the program \u2013 that we can help with volunteer recruitment,\u201d Urbina said. \u201cIdeally we\u2019re helping them to build capacity through this program.\u201d The process of testing the candidates, challenging them to develop and better articulate their agendas, she added, has also helped cultivate thousands of more informed, effective supporters. The constituent town halls and policy explainer sessions, she said, \u201chave created these super, hyper electoral influencers\u201d \u2013 like Indivisible Orange County 48 chairman Aaron McCall, who arranged four debates ahead of the local group\u2019s endorsement of Rouda, sorting through the candidates with something called the Voter Support Score, which ranks contestants based on a combination of total cash on-hand, money raised inside the district and total number of in-district donors. The local-national model embraced and built up by Indivisible has become increasingly popular among Democrats stung by the 2016 presidential result and a decade of down-ballot losses that many believe helped seed Trump\u2019s stunner. Endorsements from new groups, like Our Revolution and Justice Democrats, founded after the election, along with familiar or growing outfits like the national Working Families Party and Democracy for America, are increasingly in-demand \u2013 both as a signal to voters unaccustomed with engaging down the ballot and those looking for expert advice and elementary aid in grassroots organizing. \u201cThe Working Families Party endorsement is like a good housekeeping seal of approval for progressive voters,\u201d said Joe Dinkin of the WFP. The party, which began as a local endeavor in New York in 1998, has grown steadily since but surged in 2017 by organizing, by its own estimate, something like 1,000 \u201cResist Trump Tuesdays\u201d \u2013 often a joint effort with MoveOn.org and other groups \u2013 in the first 100 days of the administration. It also provides most candidates who win its local endorsements some combination of campaign consultation, training and voter contact strategies. But a hotly energized base and bumper crop of new candidates comes with complications. The party\u2019s House campaign arm, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, has come under intense scrutiny from progressive activists and media for its reported tactics in thinning unusually crowded primary fields. The grumbling is, in part, a question of ideology \u2013 with the left arguing the party should back more progressive candidates \u2013 and older frustrations, a feeling that the DCCC has ignored races it viewed (and dismissed) as lost causes while effectively ceding large swaths of the country to Republicans. DCCC national press secretary Tyler Law argued that Democrats don\u2019t have to choose between the party and the new grassroots groups. \u201cVoters across the country have been working hard every day to hold House Republicans accountable and flip districts blue, and the DCCC has long recognized and appreciated the unprecedented influence that the grassroots have in these races,\u201d he said. \u201cAs we\u2019ve indicated all cycle, the DCCC is working closely with our allies, including the many new grassroots organizations, to ensure that there\u2019s a competitive Democrat on the ballot for voters to elect in November.\u201d Despite its efforts to ramp up grassroots activity, an effort backed by truckloads of cash raised online from more than 340,000 first-time donors, according to Law, the party brand remains in the tank, complicating an already touchy process. Even within some districts that the DCCC and groups like Indivisible or Our Revolution agree are prime to be flipped, the party and the grassroots organizations have endorsed different candidates. Pennsylvania Democrat Jess King, who is running unopposed now due to the state\u2019s contentious redistricting process in its 11th Congressional District, remain skeptical of the party program. Her conversations with the DCCC and Our Revolution, which has endorsed her bid \u2013 as has Sanders, who will campaign for her later this week \u2013 were, King said, taking a breath to underline the understatement: \u201cVery different.\u201d When the rejiggered Pennsylvania map effectively pushed out her would-be primary opponent, but in the process left King in an even deeper red district, the prospect of meaningful aid from the party seemed that much further off. \u201cThey don\u2019t seem to be too invested in races like this and I think that\u2019s part of the problem,\u201d King said, drawing a contrast with Our Revolution. \u201cWe need to show up in places that Trump won with the exclusive populism, the white nationalist populism \u2013 we need to come in with an inclusive, welcoming populism, talking about the same things and inviting people into the process, because we can\u2019t afford to lose people to the Trump rhetoric in places like this.\u201d Urbina, from Indivisible, echoed that argument, boosting a logic commonplace in the progressive activist trenches, and now \u2013 if too slowly for some \u2013 gaining currency with the party establishment, which has invested heavily, though more quietly, in what might have been dismissed as longshot races in the pre-Trump era. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen, even as we look at patterns emerging, there is a special interest (among Democrats) in deep red places that people might look over pretty quickly,\u201d she said, adding: \u201cWe\u2019re serious about building long-term power and not just transactional power.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: James A. Barnes is a member of the CNN Decision Desk and co-author of the 2018 Almanac of American Politics. Republicans were relieved when Debbie Lesko won a special election on April 24 to maintain GOP control of the Phoenix area congressional seat of former Rep. Trent Franks. Lesko\u2019s 52.4%-47.6% victory over Democrat Hiral Tipirneni \u2014 based on unofficial but near complete returns \u2014 was welcomed by Capitol Hill Republicans who were panicked after Democrat Conor Lamb won a House special election in March in Pennsylvania in a congressional district which, like Arizona\u2019s 8th Congressional District outside Phoenix, President Donald Trump carried handily in 2016. Both Franks and the Rep. Tim Murphy from the Pennsylvania district had resigned in scandal. Just how big is the Democratic wave going to be this fall? But an analysis of the special election returns from the 143 precincts that make up the congressional district in Arizona shows that Tipirneni performed better in many of the Republican-leaning precincts in the district, relative to results from the 2016 presidential election, than in its Democratic enclaves. This suggests that Tipirneni\u2019s message that Republicans are going to cut Social Security and Medicare to fill the yawning federal budget deficits exacerbated by the 2017 GOP tax cuts hit home with independent and even some GOP voters. While many Democratic operatives have argued that the party\u2019s fortunes in the midterm elections in November will be determined by its ability to drive partisan Democrats to the polls \u2013 making the midterms a so-called \u201cbase election\u201d\u2013 Tipirneni\u2019s performance suggests that a \u201cpersuasion\u201d strategy with a message aimed at swing voters and disenchanted Republicans could also play dividends. Indeed, in GOP House seats that Hillary Clinton didn\u2019t win or even come to close carrying in 2016, a persuasion approach is probably critical. We grouped precincts in Arizona\u2019s 8th Congressional District by the percentage of the major-party vote won by Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential election and compared that to how Tipirneni performed in those clusters of precincts in the 2018 House special election. Where Clinton got less than 30% of the vote in 2016, Tipernini gained 11.1 percentage points. Where Clinton got more than 50% of the vote in 2016, Tipernini ganed less than 5 percentage points. At the same time, the number of ballots cast in the Arizona special election in Republican-leaning precincts was higher relative to the number of ballots cast in 2016 presidential election, than in the more Democratic precincts. This is not surprising as Democratic turnout normally declines in non-presidential elections. So, while the turnout in this special election was generally higher in GOP precincts than in Democratic-leaning precincts, Tipirneni was nonetheless able to perform relatively better in those GOP outposts and was likely drawing support from independents and some Republicans with her persuasion efforts. House Key Race alerts: Paul Ryan's and six other seats move toward Democrats And Tipirneni\u2019s message on Social Security and Medicare was likely to play well in this suburban and exurban congressional district known for its burgeoning retirement communities. Looking towards the midterm elections a CNN analysis of the demographics and politics of Republican-held congressional districts that most resemble AZ 8 produced the list below where a persuasion efforts by a Democratic candidate could score a win in November and include a few upsets: Illinois 14 \u2013 Incumbent: Randy Hultgren Area: Northwestern Chicagoland: McHenry, Kane, Lake counties Utah 04 \u2013 Incumbent: Mia Love Area: Central Utah: suburbs of Salt Lake City and Provo Kansas 03 \u2013 Incumbent: Kevin Yoder Area: Kansas City metro Washington 08 \u2013 Incumbent: open Area: Outer Seattle-Tacoma suburbs, central Washington Georgia 07 \u2013 Incumbent: Rob Woodall Area: Northeastern Atlanta suburbs: Gwinnett, Forsyth counties Virginia 10 \u2013 Incumbent: Barbara Comstock Area: DC and Virginia exurbs: Loudon, Fairfax counties, Winchester Florida 06 \u2013 Incumbent: Ron DeSantis Area: North Central Coast: Daytona Beach, Palm Coast California 25 \u2013 Incumbent: Steve Knight Area: Northern Los Angeles exurbs",

            "article_content": "Entering 2017, and the dawn of the Trump era, the prevailing hit on suddenly powerless Democrats was that they had no message and, worse, no ideas. When it came to political combat, the party had been schooled by the President-elect, who understood that millions of Americans were hungry for some sort of populist revival. Parts of this analysis pop up in the ongoing and often tedious debate over whether Sen. Bernie Sanders, handily defeated by Hillary Clinton in the Democratic primaries, would have been better positioned to beat Trump in the general election. One of the better arguments in Sanders\u2019 favor \u2013 though no sure shot \u2013 contends that voters who wanted to cast a ballot for a populist candidate in 2016 would have broken, if just barely, for the progressive brand if given the choice that November. The score-settling Twitter skirmishes that litigate these points, every hour of every day, might be tiresome, but the underlying questions \u2013 and answers \u2013 are still relevant. What\u2019s become increasingly clear over the past year is that the Democratic Party of 2018 has broken cleanly in Sanders\u2019 direction. What that means for Sanders\u2019 aspirations is unclear. Pundits often err in conflating the message with the messenger, the politician with his politics. That Sanders\u2019 ideas are taking hold assures him, personally, of very little. Still, it hardly requires a Capitol Hill press badge, or regular contact with party poobahs, to see where Democrats are headed \u2013 and how they are setting up to govern if they can regain control of Congress and the White House. Why a 'federal jobs guarantee' is gaining steam with Democrats In less than a year, beginning around when Republican efforts to tear down Obamacare and scale back Medicaid were ramping up, members of the Senate Democratic caucus have crafted no fewer than five pieces of legislation that would expand Medicare to cover more \u2013 or all \u2013 Americans. A new bill this week from New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker would create a pilot program for a federal jobs guarantee. Democratic Sens. Elizabeth Warren, Jeff Merkley, Kamala Harris and Kirsten Gillibrand are all cosponsors. Sanders\u2019 more comprehensive version is on the way. Gillibrand also introduced legislation this week that would require the US post office to offer bank services, effectively creating a public option for personal banking. The list goes on. To varying degrees, these bills have one crucial thing in common: they take steps toward removing private industry \u2013 and with it, profit motives \u2013 from critical aspects of public life. Unlike Obamacare, which required Americans to obtain health coverage, offered subsidies or increased access to Medicaid to those who couldn\u2019t afford it, the new crop of Democratic policy pitches largely remove the middle man. Implicit is the argument that government should protect citizens from destitution,  but that it should take an affirmative role in seeking to improve their lives. This marks a return, in large part, to the Democrats\u2019 \u201cNew Deal\u201d ethos. It\u2019s not a coincidence progressives have been citing President Franklin D. Roosevelt\u2019s \u201cSecond Bill of Rights\u201d in some recent messaging. Nor that the party named its official policy slate, introduced last summer, the \u201cBetter Deal.\u201d Though snarked upon by some at the time, and largely drowned out initially by, of all things, the unusual public exhibition of Jared Kushner\u2019s voice, it represented yet another sign of the Democratic establishment\u2019s shifting ideological moorings. As Duke public policy professor William Darity Jr. told CNN recently, during a conversation about the growing support among Senate Democrats for the jobs guarantee policy he\u2019s helped craft and push for years, the party\u2019s decades-old habit of \u201cself-censoring themselves before they put forth legislation to be considered\u201d seems to be diminishing. #2020Vision: The Sharpton primary; Sanders hits media coverage of Trump scandals; Merkley, Murphy team up on health care bill Still, there remains considerable worry within liberal circles about the prospect of ceding too much influence to the progressive left. The behind-the-scenes jockeying to clear contested midterm primary fields is one contentious battleground. Others will pop up when \u2013 and if \u2013 Democrats actually win a congressional majority this fall. While the House is very clearly in touching distance, the Senate will be a much tougher nut to crack. How Democratic officials would interpret their mandate, should their resistance be so empowered, is an open question. Being shut out of power so completely, as the Democrats are now, can be liberating. It\u2019s in the party\u2019s DNA to regard the responsibility of governing as a most serious task, and certainly not one to be trifled with by a person or organization adjudged to be insufficiently savvy or pragmatic. The opening of the floodgates for these bold new progressive bills has been, at least in part, a result of the freedom created by Trump and the GOP\u2019s grip on Congress. For all the work and advocacy that\u2019s gone into the new-look Democratic legislation, the documents remain \u2013 for now \u2013 little more than glorified press releases.",

            "article_content": "Beto O\u2019Rourke, his wife Amy and two staffers \u2013 one streaming it all live on Facebook \u2013 all pile out of a maroon Dodge Caravan rental at the courthouse here on a recent Friday afternoon. They are in Runnels County, a county in rural Central Texas where Donald Trump won 86% of the vote in 2016, to meet Republican county judge Barry Hilliard and ask which issues are on his mind. The first thing out of Hilliard\u2019s mouth: Second Amendment rights are under attack. \u201cIt\u2019s a dire situation,\u201d he said. The two debated gun control measures briefly. \u201cI\u2019ll be the first to admit I have a lot to learn about it,\u201d O\u2019Rourke politely conceded, even as he explained that AR-15s leave exit wounds the size of an orange. But the point wasn\u2019t debating gun control \u2013 it was that O\u2019Rourke showed up in Runnels County at all. \u201cIt felt like we got a real, substantive conversation,\u201d O\u2019Rourke said afterward. As the van pulls away, he hops out for a picture by a statue in front of the courthouse. That was 234 of the 254 counties in Texas down \u2013 20 to go. Stops like Runnels County on a recent six-day, 1,600-mile road trip are at the heart of O\u2019Rourke\u2019s effort to unseat Sen. Ted Cruz and become the first Democrat to win statewide in Texas in 24 years \u2013 in part by showing up and convincing voters in often-ignored regions that he cares about their interests. O\u2019Rourke will need these voters to have a shot at winning. In his March primary, O\u2019Rourke won just 62% of the Democratic vote. It\u2019s a reality that O\u2019Rourke chalks up to a travel schedule and online advertising push built with the general election in mind, but it shows he still has to sell himself to the Democratic base, too. Republicans also bested Democrats in turnout in the primary, with 1.3 million voting for Cruz compared to 644,632 votes for O\u2019Rourke. In order to defeat Cruz, O\u2019Rourke will have to win over voters who haven\u2019t voted for a Democrat statewide in over two decades. The stakes are high: An O\u2019Rourke win could give Democrats a shot at winning control of the Senate in November\u2019s midterm elections. And after a long string of disappointments \u2013 including Wendy Davis\u2019s 21-point loss in the governor\u2019s race four years ago \u2013 Democrats here say they\u2019re ready to try something different. And that something different might be shunning the support of national Democrats and progressive groups. O\u2019Rourke, the 45-year-old congressman who spent the early \u201990s as the bass player in the punk rock band Foss, raised a stunning $6.7 million from 141,000 people in 2018\u2019s first three months \u2013 by far the best of all this year\u2019s Senate candidates in both parties. That\u2019s all despite a pledge not to take any money from political action committees. It\u2019s a step beyond what other candidates have promised before: In addition to rejecting corporate cash, O\u2019Rourke is turning down checks from PACs run by left-leaning groups whose positions he strongly supports. Instead, he\u2019s relying on a massive base of small-dollar donors cultivated by Revolution Messaging, the firm behind Bernie Sanders\u2019 vaunted 2016 digital operation \u2013 as well as personal appeal that comes in part from showing up in places where many Democrats say they haven\u2019t seen a statewide candidate since Ann Richards. He first won his House seat by ousting Democratic Rep. Silvestre Reyes in a primary. He voted against Nancy Pelosi for House speaker. He gained more than two million eyeballs \u2013 including Mark Zuckerberg\u2019s \u2013 by driving 16 hours to Washington during a snowstorm with Texas Republican Rep. Will Hurd, a top target in November\u2019s midterm elections, and livestreaming the trip on Facebook. He told a Bernie Sanders supporter in Midland on Saturday that he didn\u2019t want Sanders, Hillary Clinton or any other outsiders in Texas campaigning for him. He also pledged to leave the political stage quickly: He\u2019d only serve two terms, he said in Midland. And if O\u2019Rourke is successful, national Democrats \u2013 including 2020 presidential campaigns \u2013 could learn lessons from his race. The one O\u2019Rourke said he hopes is adopted by other Democrats: Rejecting not just corporate money but all political action committee contributions. He said he sees it as responsible for his online fundraising bonanza. \u201cThat\u2019s a game-changer,\u201d O\u2019Rourke said. \u201cIt\u2019s just wrong. Interests are paying for access. And it\u2019s confusing to people \u2013 is my member of Congress voting for this interest or corporation or are they for me?\u201d *** Why do Democrats find O\u2019Rourke so compelling? It starts with his decision to stream much of his campaign \u2013 town halls, road trips, one-on-one meetings \u2013 on Facebook Live. Other candidates have had the same idea before: Kentucky Republican Sen. Rand Paul once broadcast an entire day on the Iowa campaign trail in October 2015 on Periscope. But because O\u2019Rourke does it all day, every day and because many of the moments he captures \u2013 like stopping for gas \u2013 are so mundane, it all comes across as more genuine. And people watch: 9,000 Facebookers tuned in for his meeting with Hilliard in Runnels County. That\u2019s a small audience for an O\u2019Rourke livestream, but it\u2019s nearly double the number of people who voted in the 2016 presidential election in Runnels County. \u201cBeto\u2019s like a Beatle. I mean, there\u2019s like Beto-mania,\u201d said Laura Moser, one of the two Democrats in a runoff to take on Rep. John Culberson for a Houston-area House seat. David Rosen, the Midland County Democratic chairman, after about 250 people turned out to hear O\u2019Rourke on a Saturday morning, said the crowd was dotted with people who typically vote for Republicans. \u201cIt\u2019s not only the moment, it\u2019s him,\u201d Rosen said of O\u2019Rourke. \u201cHe\u2019s energetic, he speaks well, he conveys his ideas well, and he acknowledges that he is not a far-left Democrat, a far-right Democrat \u2013 he\u2019s concerned about getting things done, and he reaches across the aisle. And people love that.\u201d Over dinner afterward at Mi Cocina, a Mexican restaurant in Sterling City, Texas, O\u2019Rourke said he thinks the appearances in rural Texas and the livestreams allow supporters and volunteers to feel invested in his campaign, like they\u2019re a part of it. He said he\u2019s not sure whether other candidates could replicate what he\u2019s doing. \u201cI totally get some people, like, \u2018I don\u2019t want people to see me eating a cheeseburger,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not for everybody.\u201d *** On the campaign trail, O\u2019Rourke rarely says Cruz\u2019s name \u2013 referring to only \u201cthe junior senator from Texas\u201d at campaign events. But type O\u2019Rourke\u2019s name into Google and this ad text pops up: \u201cBeat Ted Cruz | Join Beto O\u2019Rourke\u2019s Campaign.\u201d O\u2019Rourke admits he\u2019ll have to confront Cruz more directly in the coming months. \u201cI just don\u2019t want it to be about being against somebody else. I don\u2019t want a town hall to be, \u2018Ted Cruz this, Ted Cruz that,\u2019\u201d O\u2019Rourke said. It likely won\u2019t be up to him. Cruz greeted O\u2019Rourke\u2019s March primary victory with a radio ad that referred to him as \u201cRobert O\u2019Rourke\u201d and mocked him for going by a nickname, \u201cBeto,\u201d that O\u2019Rourke says his parents gave him as a small child growing up in El Paso. O\u2019Rourke said he still gets asked about the Cruz ad, and usually just tries to breeze past it. \u201cOur country\u2019s deserving of more. But I can also acknowledge that\u2019s politics. I guess I just try to answer the questions directly and then move on to things that are interesting,\u201d he said. O\u2019Rourke is also much more liberal than most of the 10 Democratic senators running in states Trump won this year. He told students at the University of Houston that he supports the legalization of marijuana. He campaigned in Midland for \u201cMedicare for all,\u201d the Sanders-backed single-payer health care program. He told a crowd in Brady, Texas, that he liked an idea he\u2019d heard from a voter to raise the corporate income tax from 21% to 25%. Yet at campaign stops, O\u2019Rourke insists he\u2019s not interested in the party identification of the people he meets. Lizzie Pannill Fletcher, the other Democrat in that House race in Houston, said, \u201cHis approach to campaigning, the fact that he\u2019s going to all 254 counties in Texas, the fact that he\u2019s accessible and approachable \u2013 people respond to him and they like him and they are enthusiastic about our chances of winning across the board.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Randy Bryce, a mustache-clad iron worker who is known for his nickname \u201cIron Stache,\u201d has drawn national attention for his pointed attacks on House Speaker Paul Ryan, who he was hoping to unseat in November\u2019s election. But with Ryan announcing on Wednesday that he will not seek re-election, Bryce is now the most high-profile Democratic candidate in an open race in Wisconsin\u2019s 1st Congressional District \u2013 a district national Democrats have targeted as a potential pickup in the midterms. \u201cThe mission was to repeal and replace Paul Ryan with a working person. Obviously, we\u2019ve been able to push him out \u2026 but there\u2019s still a lot of work to do,\u201d Bryce, a Latino, a veteran and cancer survivor, said in a phone interview with CNN. \u201cWe\u2019re going to face the same kind of money machine that\u2019s going to come in place and try to prop up whoever is the Republican nominee.\u201d (Kevin Seifert, Executive Director of Team Ryan, called claims that Democrats had anything to do with Ryan\u2019s decision \u201claughable.\u201d) Bryce has raised $4.75 million since launching his campaign in June 2017, according to the campaign. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee included Bryce and the district on its \u201cRed to Blue\u201d campaign program \u2013 a list of seats Democrats believe they have the best chance of flipping in 2018. House Key Race alerts: Paul Ryan's and six other seats move toward Democrats After Ryan\u2019s retirement announcement, CNN moved the seat in its race ratings from Likely Republican to Lean Republican. His campaign announcement video, which drew national attention, went after Ryan for repealing Obamacare and prominently featured Bryce\u2019s mother, who has multiple sclerosis. At the end of the video, Bryce offered to trade places with Ryan. \u201cPaul Ryan, you can come work the iron, and I\u2019ll go to DC.\u201d Bryce supports a $15 hourly minimum wage, increased staffing at the Occupational Safety and Health Administration, which oversees job site safety, Medicare for all, and Paid Family Medical Leave. Bryce has made access to affordable healthcare a key issue in his campaign. His mother lives with multiple sclerosis, and his father, a retired cop, is in an assisted-living facility. He himself is a testicular cancer survivor. When was diagnosed in his late 20s, he was working two full-time jobs but had no health insurance. So, he says, he got healthcare from a nearby medical school teaching hospital. \u201cEverybody should be able to see a doctor,\u201d Bryce said. \u201cIt\u2019s not that we can\u2019t afford to, it\u2019s just that we chose not to make it a priority.\u201d Bryce has spent the last several years working as a political coordinator for Ironworkers Local 8 and as a member of the Milwaukee Area Labor Council board of directors. He served on the Racine Labor Council and helped found the Wisconsin Chamber of Commerce for Veterans. He ran and lost in the primary for a state assembly seat in 2012, lost a primary race for the Racine County Board of Education in 2013 and lost the general election for a state senate seat in 2014. But Bryce continued to work full time during each of those races and did not have dedicated campaign staff, which he does now. When Bryce decided he wanted to run, he caught the eye of political consultant Bill Hyers, notable for managing Kirsten Gillibrand\u2019s first run for Congress in 2006 and New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio\u2019s 2013 campaign. Hyers is now chief strategist for Bryce\u2019s campaign. \u201cIt was refreshing to see someone running against the speaker with complete confidence,\u201d Hyers said. \u201cI think it\u2019s the desire to fight. His military background, his labor background \u2013 he didn\u2019t mind taking on the tough fight even if it was against the man.\u201d Hyers, who helped make Bryce\u2019s campaign video, said, \u201cHis authenticity comes across and he\u2019s not trying to be anything but what he is,\u201d Hyers said. With Ryan out of the race, the most prominent Republican candidate is Paul Nehlen, who has recently attracted attention for his anti-Semitic tweets. Nehlen lost to Ryan in the 2016 Republican primary by nearly 70 points. Other potential candidates have until June 1 to file their declarations of candidacy for the seat. The primary is August 14.",

            "article_content": "House Speaker Paul Ryan steps down in January after a twenty year career in Congress with one major accomplishment \u2013 a massive overhaul of the tax code. But the policy wonk and Republican thought leader departs without meaningful action on the agenda that led to his rise as a national Republican figure \u2013 reforming entitlement programs and tackling the nation\u2019s debt crisis. The timing of Ryan\u2019s move to announce his plans Wednesday stunned many of his GOP colleagues, many of whom expected he wouldn\u2019t talk about stepping aside until after the midterm elections in November. Paul Ryan: 'No plans to run for anything' But Ryan reminded reporters and colleagues it was a job he stepped into reluctantly after his predecessor John Boehner\u2019s own surprising decision to retire in the fall of 2015. \u201cThis is a job that does not last forever,\u201d the Wisconsin congressman said. \u201cYou realize that you hold the office for just a small part of our history, so you better make the most of it. It\u2019s fleeting, and that inspires you to do big things.\u201d Ryan\u2019s \u201cbig thing\u201d was his longtime goal to transform the large federal health care and retirement programs in order to cut back bloated federal spending. He spent years warning that the debt would cripple the nation\u2019s economic outlook. Most notably, he proposed that the current Medicare system shift into one modeled on private care rather than a government one-size-fits-all program. During his tenure as chairman of the House Budget Committee, he methodically rolled out detailed proposals and his expertise on economic issues was one of the reasons the 2012 presidential nominee Mitt Romney picked him as a running mate. He went from showcasing PowerPoint presentations for his colleagues in Capitol Hill hearing rooms to traveling the country and gaining a national profile. Democrats repeatedly tried to use his Medicare proposal as a campaign issue, even making one political ad that featured someone who looked like Ryan pushing someone in a wheelchair off a cliff. Under his framework, the government would no longer directly pay bills for senior citizens in the program. Instead, recipients would choose a plan from a list of private providers, which the federal government would subsidize. Ryan also argued that Medicaid, which provides health care for the disabled and the poor, should be administered by the states by sending them block grants to spend in the ways each governor decided best fit needs of its citizens. There is a wave of Republicans leaving Congress, updated again Rep. Steve Womack, an Arkansas Republican, who now chairs the budget panel, told reporters that these kind of major reforms remain \u201can elusive target\u201d for the party. The GOP-controlled House was able to approve them as part of budget resolutions, but they failed to gain traction beyond those votes. \u201cThe timing is never right for it,\u201d Womack said. \u201cIt\u2019s either a brand new administration or an upcoming election, or another transformational piece of legislation that has occupied our time.\u201d A new report from the Congressional Budget Office showed that deficits under the GOP-controlled Congress are growing larger instead of diminishing as Ryan and others pledged they would. The nonpartisan report said that the deficits over a trillion dollars will start in 2020, two years earlier than what the CBO predicted just 10 months ago. In ten years, CBO projected the deficit will be over $1.5 trillion. This is due to both the tax bill enacted last year and the spending bill approved just last month. The '2-by-4' that hit Paul Ryan before his decision not to run again President Donald Trump effectively shot down Ryan\u2019s dream of making headway on entitlement reforms. He campaigned against touching Medicare and Social Security and reiterated he had no desire to change course when he took office. On Wednesday, the House speaker admitted that there was more work to do on reshaping those large federal programs. Ryan touted that the House did pass a repeal of Obamacare and lamented the fact the Senate couldn\u2019t get that through. He boasted that \u201cnormalizing entitlement reform, pushing the cause of entitlement reform\u201d was something he was proud he accomplished through pushing his budgets and his record as speaker. Boehner pointed out in his statement Wednesday that Ryan\u2019s proposals became the centerpiece of the GOP\u2019s economic agenda. \u201cHis budgets during my own speakership showed the American people our conservative vision for addressing the drivers of our debt and restoring a path to prosperity for our children,\u201d the former Ohio congressman said. Ryan has said for years that serving as chairman of the tax-writing committee was always his dream job. He held that post when Boehner retired and he was propelled into the top leadership post. Ryan said Wednesday that the tax bill was \u201csomething that I\u2019ve been working on in my entire adult life.\u201d His colleagues and allies outside of the Capitol say Ryan grew into the role of speaker and quickly learned how to work within the various factions of the GOP conference to reach consensus. Cesar Conda, a former Hill aide and ally of Ryan\u2019s, said that he\u2019s watched him evolve over the years from staffer to speaker, gaining momentum and skills that the policy wonk didn\u2019t possess in the earlier days. House Key Race alerts: Paul Ryan's and six other seats move toward Democrats \u201cHe has evolved from a strictly policy-oriented legislator who was just concerned about policy X and policy Y to someone who had to count votes and put together coalitions,\u201d Conda said. \u201cThat wasn\u2019t one of his strengths going into the job but he learned it pretty quickly.\u201d Ryan downplayed any splits he\u2019s had with Trump during a session with a small group of reporters in his Capitol office Wednesday, saying that the opportunity to enact major policy changes gave him perspective on his priorities as speaker. \u201cThe tweet of the moment pales in comparison to the big policy changes that I really believe are gonna make a big difference in people\u2019s lives, are going to move us in the right direction,\u201d he said. \u201cThose things completely overshadow the frustrations of the day or of the moment.\u201d GOP lawmakers spent Wednesday praising Ryan, and also pointing to the tax legislation as his chief legacy. \u201cHe got it done. He got it done in a real way. This tax bill has been transformational,\u201d said Rep. Mario Diaz-Balart of Florida.  \u201cI think history will record Speaker Ryan as a very effective, transformational speaker.\u201d CNN\u2019s Phil Mattingly contributed to this report.",

He said he\u2019s doing it for family reasons, but for Democrats itching to overthrow the GOP majority, the skies \u2013 and congressional maps \u2013 never looked bluer. Word of Ryan\u2019s planned departure set off the expected round of exit applause (from GOP officials and conservative think tankers) and victory laps (by Democratic officials, candidates and liberal think tankers). A forensic examination of his relationship with President Donald Trump, whom Ryan has supported in all the meaningful ways during these past 14 months and three weeks, commenced immediately. If this is a time for drafting first editions of Ryan\u2019s congressional legacy, two clear narrative lines emerge from the thicket of instant reactions. The first and most consequential is rooted in what Ryan described at a Wednesday press briefing as his success in \u201cnormalizing entitlement reform.\u201d Put plainly, he was talking about Republican efforts to make it politically acceptable, and electorally sustainable, for lawmakers to push for the privatization or scaling back of welfare state programs like Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. Paul Ryan: 'No plans to run for anything' During Ryan\u2019s nearly two decades on Capitol Hill, conservative messaging around those policy goals has become more refined and, until the current Congress took aim at Obamacare last year and launched a progressive revival, a political \u201cthird rail\u201d slowly being starved of voltage. That pursuit has animated Ryan for his entire political life, from the time he was \u201cdrinking at a keg,\u201d to his first election in 1998, and for the last 18 years, as he drew up slash-and-burn budget plans \u2013 aka \u201cThe Roadmap\u201d \u2013 and successfully sold himself as Washington\u2019s wonk-in-chief, a serious person with serious ideas in a chamber and town increasingly resistant to both. Former President George W. Bush, in his second term, even proposed a version of Ryan\u2019s social security plan, which quickly sank along with Bush\u2019s political fortunes. By 2012, though, The New Yorker had installed Ryan as leader of the Republican Party\u2019s \u201cattack-and-propose faction.\u201d That year, then-presumptive GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney picked Ryan to be his running mate. The campaign stage didn\u2019t suit the low-key congressman, who struggled to defend his fiscal analysis when faced with more pugnacious scrutiny. A convention speech riddled with factual flubs, along with an odd anecdote about a fudged marathon time, sullied his Boy Scout brand. Romney\u2019s bid failed, of course, but Ryan easily retained his seat in Wisconsin\u2019s 1st Congressional District despite and, after Tea Party members finally inspired his predecessor, John Boehner, to quit in September 2015, Ryan, with House Republicans at an impasse, assumed the most powerful job in Congress. Democrats have a shot at winning Paul Ryan's seat Whether or not one buys into Ryan\u2019s portrayal as a reluctant leader, a dutiful party man who would\u2019ve been happier hammering away at a calculator as chair of the House Ways and Means or Budget committees, the timing of his ascent was ironic. As he settled in to the speakership, Donald Trump was well on his way to bulldozing the Republican presidential primary field. Ryan\u2019s political and ideological allies, like Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker (an early favorite who dropped out months before the first ballots were cast) and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, were paved under Trump\u2019s populist path. Trump\u2019s general election victory in 2016 put Ryan in a tricky position. At least, that was the story at the time. But whatever concerns he might have had, Ryan stayed faithful to his agenda. After nearly two decades in Washington, he would lead a Republican House, working alongside a Republican Senate, with a Republican president in the Oval Office, ready to sign off on their work. As for the tweets, well, Ryan had the good sense to not see them. Ryan stood by Trump and, for his loyalty, put the GOP in a position to deliver what will be remembered as his most consequential achievement in politics: the 2017 Republican tax cuts. Their passage along mostly party lines delivered a massive, permanent reduction to corporate rates, which dropped nearly 15% points from 35%, cut levies on individual and pass-through income (provisions that will expire at the end of 2025) and set the stage for potential future rollbacks in social spending. The net effect will be a massive transfer of wealth from the poor and working classes to the wealthy. Equally important is the projection made by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office in its recently published 10-year budget and economic outlook. The CBO estimates the US will run trillion-dollar deficits indefinitely starting in 2020. The driving factor? Decreased revenue from 2017\u2019s tax cuts and the cost of the subsequent budget deal, a compromise passed with Ryan\u2019s blessing, and signed, after some grousing, by Trump. Ryan noted in his press conference that he\u2019d only finished half the job \u2013 tax reform. \u201cMore work needs to be done,\u201d he said, \u201cand it really is entitlements.\u201d Thanks to Ryan, and GOP policies that created a question now in need of solving, their work will be that much easier.",

            "article_content": "Our weekly roundup of the news, notes and chatter about the prospects for the next Democratic presidential race: It was a tale of two votes for Democrats last week. While the party celebrated its showing in Pennsylvania on Tuesday, a vote to dial back bank regulations exposed cracks in the blue wall on Capitol Hill \u2014 and the limits, for now, of progressive activist power. Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, the legislation\u2019s loudest critic, offered this big picture criticism soon after the vote: \u201cThe American people aren\u2019t going to stand by while big banks and giant corporations run this economy and this Congress for their own benefit,\u201d she tweeted. \u201cSoon \u2013 maybe not today, or next week, or even in the next election \u2013 but soon, they will demand a government that works for the people.\u201d Warren clashed with moderate Dems who supported the bill, like North Dakota Sen. Heidi Heitkamp, who told The Atlantic of Warren, \u201cShe doesn\u2019t live where I live.\u201d So, yes, this was in part a regional thing. (See Nevada, one of the states hit worst by the housing crisis, where Sen. Catherine Cortez Masto \u2014 hardly a hardline lefty \u2014 touted her vote against the bill and state Democrats immediately hit GOP Sen. Dean Heller over his vote for it.) But it also exposed, or reminded us of, the ideological split within the party \u2014 one that isn\u2019t going away in the coming year. SANDERS AND WARREN TOGETHER ON MONDAY NIGHT: Sens. Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren, along with filmmaker Michael Moore and others, will host a town hall \u201cfocused on inequality in the United States\u201d on Monday night, in partnership with The Guardian, NowThis, The Young Turks and Act.tv. It\u2019s a follow up to a \u201cMedicare for all\u201d event Sanders hosted and was streamed by progressive groups back in January. The first time out drew, according to Sanders\u2019 office, 1.6 million viewers. HICKENLOOPER LAYING GROUNDWORK FOR A 2020 RUN? Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper is the subject of a deep dive from The Denver Post that details his meetings with key unions, an undisclosed Paris trip in December for a major climate-change summit, and recently a lunch meeting in New York with Vernon Jordan. \u201cHe was very gracious and asked me about 2020, and I said, \u2018Well, you know, my wife and I hadn\u2019t made up our minds,\u2019\u201d Hickenlooper told the newspaper about the lunch meeting. \u2014 Also worth noting: The newspaper reports Hickenlooper \u201cmay not be the only Democrat from Colorado with eyes on the White House. Many of the same Democratic insiders who described Hickenlooper\u2019s thinking said former Sen. Ken Salazar and current Sen. Michael Bennet are at least considering a run.\u201d THE QUIET CAMPAIGN: It\u2019s still a bit early to expect to learn too much from staffing moves, but as Politico\u2019s Gabe Debenedetti wrote on Sunday, \u201cAt least a dozen possible Democratic presidential candidates have begun bolstering their teams by adding aides with campaign experience to their Senate staffs, personal offices or 2018 reelection payrolls.\u201d Again, though, careful about reading too much into these: \u2014\u201dBarack Obama\u2019s former top digital strategist, Joe Rospars, for example, has been helping Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren\u2019s team.\u201d \u2014\u201dFormer Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe\u2019s longtime aide Michael Halle is now running (Richard Cordray\u2019s) gubernatorial campaign in Ohio.\u201d \u2014\u201dNew Jersey Sen. Cory Booker recently hired Tamia Booker (no relation) \u2014 Hillary Clinton\u2019s national African-American outreach director in the 2016 general election and a veteran of the Obama administration and the 2016 Democratic convention \u2014 as his deputy chief of staff.\u201d \u2026to name a few. Money/funny quote from an anonymous Dem strategist: \u201cMy biggest terror right now is that three or four of my clients might get into this thing.\u201d LAMB\u2019S SURROGATES: Pennsylvania\u2019s Conor Lamb made huge news this week as a Democrat winning a House special election in a district President Donald Trump carried by 20 percentage points. It\u2019s revealing \u2014 both of where they\u2019re popular and where they might see a path for a Democratic resurgence \u2014 to note the 2020 prospects who campaigned for him: Former Vice President Joe Biden, Massachusetts Rep. Joe Kennedy III and former Maryland Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley. 2020 MADNESS, IN A BRACKET: If there\u2019s one thing that we know for sure about the 2020 Democratic primary, it\u2019s that there will be a lot of candidates. So, in time with March Madness, we tried to come up with a way to visualize how the competition might play out. Not all of the folks named below will run (e.g., the \u201cLefties\u201d bracket might empty if Warren or Sanders go forward) and there\u2019s certainly some overlap in terms of what brackets that might belong in \u2026 but have a look \u2014 and make your pick! (Complaints and picks to @gregjkrieg.) FLAKE TALKS TRUMP CHALLENGE IN NEW HAMPSHIRE: Retiring Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake was in New Hampshire on Friday, stoking chatter that he could challenge President Donald Trump in the 2020 GOP primary. \u201cI hope that someone does run the Republican primary, somebody to challenge the President,\u201d Flake said, per CNN\u2019s Ashley Killough, after a man in the audience asked if he\u2019d make a White House run. \u201cI think the odds that I will are long, but I\u2019ve not ruled it out.\u201d TRUMP\u2019S 2020 ENFORCER: Brad Parscale, the digital strategist recently named Trump\u2019s 2020 campaign manager, is already flexing his muscles. From Eric and Manu Raju this weekend on his intervention to help Sen. Dean Heller in a Nevada GOP primary: \u201c(Heller challenger Danny) Tarkanian told CNN that Trump 2020 campaign manager Brad Parscale called Wednesday night \u2013 less than two days before Nevada\u2019s filing deadline \u2013 to say that Trump wanted him out of the Senate race. \u2018He said it\u2019d be best for party unity, best chance to get his \u2018America First\u2019 agenda passed,\u2019 Tarkanian said. \u2026 Tarkanian called Parscale back later Thursday and told him he needed a public indication that Trump would have his back if he exited the Senate primary and ran for the 3rd District House seat instead.\u201d (The tweet came the next day.) The biggest Democratic super PAC, Priorities USA, plans to sit out the 2020 Democratic primary and instead focus on attacking Donald Trump until the party has a nominee, NBC\u2019s Alex Seitz-Wald reports. \u2026 Oregon Sen. Jeff Merkley hit the midterm stump for Nevada Rep. Jacky Rosen, who\u2019s running to unseat Sen. Dean Heller, on Saturday, joining her for a roundtable with the Nevada Conservation League.

            "article_content": "Our weekly roundup of the news, notes and chatter about the prospects for the next Democratic presidential race: Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren says \u2013 present tense \u2013 she\u2019s not a 2020 candidate. \u201cI am not running for president in 2020,\u201d she told CNN\u2019s Jim Acosta this weekend. But many of her recent actions suggest otherwise. Warren announced last week at a Democratic National Committee gala that she\u2019d sent a check for $5,000 to all 50 state parties \u2013 $250,000 total. \u201cI want a Democratic Party strong enough to compete for every vote, in every race, at every level, in every state, in every election \u2013 and I\u2019m willing to do my part to help make that happen,\u201d she said. While Warren was bolstering her state-level ties, she was warring with fellow Democrats on Capitol Hill. Fighting against a bank bill Tuesday, after the vote to advance the legislation, she retweeted a list of Democrats who backed it, adding: \u201cSenate Republicans voted unanimously for the #BankLobbyistAct. But this bill wouldn\u2019t be on the path to becoming law without the support of these Democrats. The Senate just voted to increase the chances your money will be used to bail out big banks again.\u201d The upshot: Warren is certainly aware that the short-term awkwardness with colleagues could pay off in 2020, when the party\u2019s primary electorate is likely to be well to the left of the Senate Democratic caucus. DNC MOVES TO CURB SUPERDELEGATES: The fight over exactly what role superdelegates should play in the 2020 nominating process won\u2019t be resolved until this summer \u2013 but the Democratic National Committee voted over the weekend on a big-picture goal: Reducing them. The full DNC accepted a recommendation to \u201crevise the role and reduce the perceived influence\u201d of superdelegates. What that means, exactly, will be sorted out by the Rules and Bylaws Committee ahead of a June deadline to prepare a final proposal for the August DNC meeting. What to watch: The 21-member Unity Reform Commission recommended a 60% reduction in superdelegates \u2013 binding DNC members to their states\u2019 results on the first ballot but allowing elected officials and former presidents and vice presidents to retain their unpledged status. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders\u2019 allies are pushing to go further \u2013 doing away with unpledged delegates altogether, at least on the first ballot. The campaign that never ends: Sanders on Friday told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper that superdelegates should be eliminated entirely. In a statement on the DNC\u2019s moves Saturday, Hillary Clinton praised other reforms but didn\u2019t mention superdelegates at all. BERNIE SANDERS IN TRUMP COUNTRY: Since Donald Trump\u2019s election, Bernie Sanders has visited 28 states (not counting his home in Vermont), often headlining multiple events in different cities over the course of just a few hours. He\u2019s keynoted events with progressive groups opposing Obamacare repeal and the GOP tax bill, done a book tour, and \u2013 increasingly as the midterms near \u2013 endorsed and stumped with congressional candidates. The reasoning is simple, Sanders said this week before heading for Texas and Arizona: \u201cWe have put a significant effort into going into states that Trump won. Not exclusively, but most of the states that I\u2019ve visited have been states that Trump won. The reason for that is, I think it\u2019s important for people who voted for Trump to understand that many of the promises that he made on health care, on taxes, on many other issues, are promises that he did not keep.\u201d \u2013 On Trump\u2019s new tariffs \u2013 25% on steel imports and 10% on aluminum imports \u2013 Sanders, who campaigned on protectionist policies like Trump, said: \u201cDo we need radical changes in our trade policy to rebuild American manufacturing and protect the American worker? Absolutely, positively. That\u2019s exactly what I campaigned on. Do I think that Trump\u2019s approach of just putting tariffs on steel and aluminum, is gonna solve the problem? The answer is no, it is not. We need a more comprehensive approach.\u201d \u2013 Asked if Congress should get more involved in the process, he said: \u201cAbsolutely, absolutely, absolutely. I will credit Trump, which I very rarely do, to put his finger on a real problem. I do not want to see the continued de-industrialization of the loss of good paying jobs, whether it\u2019s steel, aluminum, or any other industry. We need serious legislation.\u201d BIDEN ISN\u2019T SLOWING DOWN: Former Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s busy week began with campaign stops in Pennsylvania, where he stumped for Democrat Conor Lamb before Tuesday\u2019s special election in Pennsylvania\u2019s 18th District. It ended on Friday with a speech at the Kellogg School of Management at Northwestern University in Evanston, Illinois, where he spoke about economic opportunity. Biden\u2019s stop in western Pennsylvania was not just a stump speech, but an opportunity to offer a glimpse of how he\u2019d approach 2020 if he runs for president again: by working to rebuild a Democratic coalition that includes white, rural, blue-collar voters. He slammed Trump for the tax bill, saying it would lead to cuts in Medicare and Social Security, and tried to appeal to voters dissatisfied with the President in a district he won by 20 points in 2016. KAMALA\u2019S PLANS: In a Politico dive into California Sen. Kamala Harris\u2019s positioning in the Senate, she discussed being approached to run in 2020 \u2013 without actually tipping her hand about whether she\u2019ll do it. \u201cI have seen so many people along the way focused on that thing out there, and they trip over the thing in front of them. And the thing in front of us is so important,\u201d Harris said. \u201cI\u2019m going to let everybody else sit around and think about things that have yet to approach.\u201d MERKLEY \u2018KEEPING THE OPTION OPEN\u2019: Oregon Sen. Jeff Merkley told local radio station KOIN he is \u201ckeeping the option open\u201d for a potential 2020 run \u2013 but that his planned March 24 trip to New Hampshire doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s in. \u201cMy main focus is the fight for 51, to get a Democratic majority in the Senate that can stop some of the worst of Trump\u2019s policies and also the packing of the courts,\u201d Merkley said. A NIXON TO EXCITE THE LEFT? Cynthia Nixon, that is. The actress and activist, a staple of New York City progressive politics for some time now, is inching closer to a primary challenge to Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who\u2019s seeking his third term \u2013 and could, with a rout, put himself in a position to run in 2020. But Nixon, who\u2019s getting advice from strategists Rebecca Katz (a longtime top aide and ally of New York Mayor Bill de Blasio) and Bill Hyers, poses two kinds of threats to Cuomo: 1) To actually beat him. She has the name recognition and the right politics to flank him on the left; and 2) By coming close, to put a major dent in Cuomo\u2019s standing with liberals, who already have their qualms. Asked on a conference call last week whether he thought de Blasio was encouraging Nixon into the race, Cuomo offered this: \u201cI think it was either the mayor of New York or Vladimir Putin. I am going to leave it to you great investigative reporters to follow the facts and ferret out the truth.\u201d GARCETTI ON LATE NIGHT: Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti was on Late Night with Seth Meyers on Tuesday and spoke about his passion for local politics \u2013 and slammed national politicians in Washington, which is something he\u2019s been repeatedly doing through his stops and visits around the country in early primary states. He specifically called out Washington for not acting on the issues of homelessness and DACA \u2013 both of which strongly impact his city. Meyers did ask him about his 2020 prospects, and what he would say about the attacks on him from the right calling him the Hollywood candidate. \u201cWe do have more Kardashians than anywhere else, but most of us are not Kardashians \u2026  so I can relate to that conversation on a local level with the mayor in Dayton, a mayor in Columbia, South Carolina, mayor in South Bend, Indiana, like Mayor Pete (Buttigieg) \u2026 and we speak the language I think of America. It\u2019s Washington that\u2019s that swamp and it\u2019s only getting swampier.\u201d ELLISON GRABS THE SINGLE-PAYER TORCH: Minnesota Rep. Keith Ellison, the DNC deputy chair, is the new lead sponsor of the House single-payer health care bill, taking over the title from former Rep. John Conyers. The House allowed the largely symbolic switcheroo by unanimous consent on Wednesday, but it was an important one for folks who didn\u2019t want the legislation attached to Conyers\u2019 name after his resignation amid sexual harassment allegations last year. \u201cThe movement carries on,\u201d Ellison said in an interview that afternoon. \u201cI remain a staunch advocate of the ACA, but we can imagine a world in which we can have universal health care styled on a \u2018Medicare for all\u2019 bill.\u201d What now? \u201cWe are in the middle of a very critical national conversation and we\u2019re going to incorporate into the next iteration that which we learn \u2013 so we expect the bill to get better, with more flesh on the bones,\u201d he said. (The text of the bill remains unchanged.) You can also expect Republicans to use Ellison\u2019s title with the DNC \u2013 which is also mostly symbolic \u2013 to allege the party is moving too far left. It\u2019s worth noting, though, that single-payer is a long ways away from being adapted by a DNC platform committee. FLAKE CALLS FOR A TRUMP CHALLENGER: During an appearance on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d on Sunday morning, Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake again called for a Republican to challenge President Donald Trump in 2020. Flake has long been a Trump critic, and has said he himself would not rule out a 2020 challenge to Trump. Flake\u2019s upcoming visit to New Hampshire next weekend is stoking speculation that Flake is considering being that Republican challenger to Trump in 2020. The senator will address the New Hampshire Institute of Politics at their \u201cPolitics & Eggs\u201d event on Friday, which has become a popular stop for potential presidential contenders. Continuing his re-entrance into the political world, former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick will be speaking at the National Constitution Center in Philadelphia on Thursday at an event called \u201cRenewing the Founders\u2019 Promise.\u201d CNN\u2019s Sophie Tatum, Ashley Killough, Saba Hamedy, David Siegel and Betsy Klein contributed to this memo.",

            "article_content": "Sen. Bernie Sanders said Friday that the recent attacks on a Texas candidate for Congress by the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee are \u201cabsolutely unacceptable.\u201d During an interview with CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper at the South by Southwest tech and media conference in Austin, Texas, Sanders shared his views on the ongoing battle in Texas between the DCCC, the party\u2019s political arm for House races, and Laura Moser, a journalist and activist who is in the running to challenge Republican Rep. John Culberson this fall. \u201cI detest that type of politics, and I think most Americans do,\u201d the Vermont independent said. \u201cAnd then when you have the DCCC actually doing opposition research on a serious and strong candidate for the US Congress, when the Democratic establishment itself is engaging in negative attacks against a responsible candidate, that is absolutely unacceptable.\u201d The Democratic House primary in the Houston area has become a stand-in for the broader battle within the party between progressives, who backed Sanders, and members of the establishment. Our Revolution, the political organization that controls Sanders\u2019 massive email list, has endorsed Moser. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee dug up a 2014 Washingtonian article in which Moser wrote that she\u2019d \u201csooner have my teeth pulled out without anesthesia\u201d than live in Paris, Texas. Progressive activists were incensed to see the group weigh in with such a heavy hand less than three weeks from the March 6 contest. \u201cIt was outrageous,\u201d Sanders said of the committee\u2019s attacks on Moser. Moser ended up as one of the two highest vote-getters and heads to a runoff in the primary. Sanders expressed optimism, however, about the possibility of Texas, a traditionally Republican state, electing Democrats in 2018. \u201cIf you in Texas are prepared to work hard, stand up, fight back, go out to your neighbors, talk to those people who voted for Trump, make sure that every friend you have and every family member you have comes out to vote,\u201d Sander said, \u201cI believe Texas can go blue.\u201d Sanders said Republicans are able to win in states like Texas when \u201cvoter turnout is low and big money buys elections.\u201d \u201cIf we can raise voter turnout, if 50% of the people come out in a midterm election, one out of two people, that\u2019s not asking for much,\u201d he said. \u201cDemocrats will win in Texas and in every other state in this country.\u201d But on Tuesday, Texas\u2019 primary provided little evidence to support Sanders\u2019 hopes. With over 99% of precincts counted, Democratic turnout topped 1 million in a midterm primary in the state for the first time since 2002. Republicans, on the other hand, cast 1.5 million votes in their primary. In other words, 60% of all votes cast in Tuesday\u2019s primary went to Republican candidates. Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke won the state\u2019s Democratic primary election, emerging as Sen. Ted Cruz\u2019s challenger this fall. If O\u2019Rourke wins, he will be the first Democrat to win a statewide election since 1994 and the first Democrat elected to the Senate from Texas since 1988. CNN has downgraded that race from Solid Republican to Likely Republican. Sanders made the case to Texas voters that what he described as the current Republican agenda is not in line with the majority of Americans\u2019 beliefs. \u201cThe Republican agenda of tax breaks for billionaires, throwing millions of people off of health care, cutting Social Security and Medicare and Medicaid \u2026 is an agenda supported by relatively few people,\u201d he told Tapper. Sanders also weighed in on Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan\u2019s recent anti-Semitic speech in Chicago. Asked by Tapper what he thought about the left\u2019s hesitation in condemning Farrakhan\u2019s speech, which included things like \u201cthe powerful Jews are my enemy\u201d and \u201cSatanic Jews,\u201d Sanders said: \u201cRacism is not acceptable. Religious bigotry against Muslims or Jews or anybody else is not acceptable.\u201d Sanders told Tapper he would \u201ctake on\u201d Farrakhan or anybody else who espouses such views. \u201cWe as a nation have got to do everything that we can to fight anybody, whether it\u2019s Trump, Farrakhan or anybody else, who is trying to divide us up,\u201d he said.

            "article_content": "Andy Slavitt, the former UnitedHealth Group executive who spent two years as the acting head of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services under President Barack Obama, has some experience with rough launches. In 2013, Slavitt was part of the team that rescued Healthcare.gov after the online marketplace\u2019s bungled rollout. Over the next few years, he took a lead role in steering the Affordable Care Act through a fraught implementation period. Then, amid the squall of Republican efforts to gut the law in 2017, Slavitt emerged, via his Twitter account, as one of the grassroots liberal opposition\u2019s favorite wonks. But with the unveiling this week of his new nonprofit, called the \u201cUnited States of Care,\u201d Slavitt himself has come under fire by activists \u2013 some suspicious of his intentions, others confused or troubled by his tactics. The bipartisan group\u2019s aim, it says on a sleek website littered with sometimes impenetrable banalities, is to consolidate public opinion around policies that would \u201censure that every single American has access to quality, affordable health care,\u201d no matter his or her station. What precisely that means, or how it should be achieved, is left open to interpretation. Those blank spaces have roiled the progressive left, so often criticized for failing to offer specifics in its own advocacy, as it works to build support for a single-payer, or \u201cMedicare for all,\u201d plan. The prospect of reaching across the aisle, in pursuit of good-faith compromise, has also struck many as out of touch with the moment, especially as Democrats fight with one arm against GOP efforts to undercut Obamacare \u2013 like they did in eliminating the individual mandate late last year \u2013 and the other to chart a path toward expanding coverage and care to millions of the uninsured. On Wednesday, I discussed with Slavitt the organization\u2019s purpose and the brewing controversy over his intentions. (Hours later, he tweeted plans to answer the criticism more formally in the coming days.) The interview that follows has been edited and condensed. Krieg: On the United States of Care site, you say \u2013 this is a quote \u2013 \u201cWe must change the conversation and create a new narrative that puts health care over politics by redefining the goal in human, not political terms. \u2026\u201d How would you describe the current narrative? Slavitt: Our narrative, unfortunately, is limited by what our politicians and our lawmakers are willing to do. And the public doesn\u2019t feel particularly well represented by that. They feel like the needs of their families, their concerns, aren\u2019t represented and that we don\u2019t have politics that represent the need for American families to be able to afford to take their kids to the doctor, to afford their prescriptions, so they\u2019re fearful. If we\u2019re going to build a new, positive vision, we need to start with a narrative that is grounded in the realities and desires and goals people have to have a better health care system \u2013 and do it in a way that is sustainable, and not worry that it\u2019s going to be tipped over every election cycle. Krieg: Why not then put this energy and these resources behind some of the movements that are already out there? \u201cMedicare for all\u201d obviously now has traction with Senate Democrats, as do other less comprehensive plans. There are a lot of people already out there trying to create a new narrative, in favor of expanding care. Why not put your influence and, maybe, money behind them? Slavitt: One of the questions (being asked by critics) is about me personally and, you know, I personally am not changing. I don\u2019t expect that my views or my activities personally around making sure that we\u2019re fighting to get better health care for more people changes. And I don\u2019t expect other people who are affiliated with the organization or part of sponsoring it to change their activities, whether they agree with me or disagree with me. But we have to do something over the long term in addition to make sure that we\u2019re not having this war forever. The question is how do we do that? And there\u2019s no guarantees that it\u2019ll ever happen. But what is clear to me, and I think a number of other people, is if we don\u2019t take down the temperature of the debate, then, the next time we go at doing this, we\u2019re still going to be more and more divisive. So I think there is room for us in the debate to focus on both what needs to happen now and over the next couple years \u2013 which is, as you point out, there are a number of organizations that are well-suited for that and some of which I\u2019m affiliated with and will continue to be affiliated with \u2013 but also for there to be a movement that\u2019s a little bit longer term that changes the equation. Think about big changes that have happened in the country, (like) marriage equality. That didn\u2019t start the year before laws were changed. That started decades before laws were changed. There needs to be a movement and effort to establish successful change that occurs beyond just the current year. I think this is an organization that has an opportunity, if done right, to make a difference in the long-term debate even while people are working on these very challenging issues in the near term. Krieg: To be clear, though, you were speaking to Modern Healthcare about this, and you\u2019re quoted as saying, \u201cWe believe every single American should have access to basic, affordable care. But we avoid using language like universal coverage that is polarizing. We want to bring people together, and certain words are used by one party or another to create divides.\u201d So, asking as directly possible: Do you support or oppose single-payer health care? Slavitt: Do I personally? Krieg: Yes. Slavitt: I would personally love to be in a world where we have, once and for all, given every American health care, and that\u2019s certainly one way to do it. So, to that extent, the answer is yes. Krieg: OK, but how do you feel, not personally now, but as an activist or political actor? Slavitt: What I believe is that there are a number of ideas, including new ideas, that are going to be necessary to get to where we want to get. I believe that it\u2019s going to take a number of years from where we are today, so for someone who believes in single-payer, \u201cMedicare for all,\u201d I hope that you can also be for other things that are good for people in the meantime, and that those things might even build the ability to get there. I also believe that there are lots of approaches, because there\u2019s not even one ready bill; it\u2019s not like there\u2019s a bill that\u2019s ready that can do everything because the Medicare program, of course, is designed for seniors. It\u2019s not designed for younger people, low-income people, etc. So there\u2019s a lot of un-sexy dirty work that has to happen, to make these policies work, to get public support for them. To vet them, to drive them. So if you look at the three principles of (USoC), they include anything that can get people access to the coverage they need, the care they need, protect them from bankruptcy and do it in a way that can be lasting from an economic and political standpoint. That absolutely includes single-payer and it includes other ideas that are either currently formed or that need to be formed. Krieg: One of the criticisms of the organization is that this, effectively, is an abandoning of politics. It\u2019s saying, \u201cWe can\u2019t fight and win, we need to come to a truce.\u201d Is this giving up on politics? Slavitt: I\u2019m glad you asked that question because that\u2019s the exact wrong interpretation. Krieg: Why? Slavitt: Because we need to use the grassroots and the will of the people to change the politics and to use the politics and to translate what people really want and believe into political change. The reality is that right now we don\u2019t have the political make-up where people have the incentive to compromise. We have people in a world where their incentive is to get more polarized. So when we say health care over politics is a top priority, it (means) that we want to have an impact on constituents first in making care accessible to all Americans. When we change the politics, or prevail over the politics, what it will mean to me, I think, to many of us on board, is when you show up every day as a lawmaker, who are you thinking about? Are you thinking about your next campaign or are you thinking about your constituents back home and their needs. As soon as we can flip that equation around, I think we will win. Krieg: Reading your interviews around the rollout, my impression is that you believe policy backed by one party, or a law that\u2019s passed along party lines, is intrinsically, if not bad, then doomed. Is that right? Slavitt: Well, I\u2019ll tell you that what I\u2019ve lived through for the last number of years is something that I hope the country doesn\u2019t have to go through much longer \u2013 where one party pulls on one side of the rope and the other party pulls on the other side of the rope. I think our aim ought to be to get policies that can pass with over 60% to 70% support if we can, because that reflects, at least by what public polling suggests, the will of the American public. I think we\u2019d like to have our elected representatives vote in ways that support where the public is. Now, it\u2019s not that simple and a lot of work needs to be done but laws are more stable when we don\u2019t feel like every election we worry that they\u2019re going to get overturned. So of course it would be better for everybody if we could answer this question once and for all. Krieg: Going back to your experience these last few years. Republicans have been very open about their position on all this. They do not like Obamacare. But they also don\u2019t, as we\u2019ve seen, really have a plan to replace it. What would you say to activists who argue, even with Republicans on the board, that you\u2019re cloistering yourself, with other elite thinker types, and then setting up to negotiate with yourselves? Slavitt: I don\u2019t think anyone is negotiating anything. The question is whether there are people from diverse views who all believe it\u2019s time to change the dialogue and that the politics is getting in the way. There are a number people whose differences were not brought on board to be reconciled. They are perfectly irreconcilable because their goal is not to strive for agreement or even to support whatever policies are approved. Their goal is to say, these are three principles that we should put over politics and, in so doing, we will allow for a dialogue that will get us all to better answers. There is purposely nothing that all the people who put their names on the website are going to all agree to \u2013 their interests are more purposely diverse. This isn\u2019t a convening body which is aiming to forge a tepid consensus. These are people who know that it\u2019s going to be OK to publicly to disagree. And everything I\u2019m saying to you now, I know there are people on the founder\u2019s council who will disagree with that \u2013 and they have said to me, \u201cAndy, you know that I may publicly disagree with you.\u201d And those are the terms under which their support happens. They\u2019re not going to be people who are going to be involved in watering down the policies to a place where they don\u2019t accomplish their principles. The principles are fundamental.",

            "article_content": "Bernie Sanders is revving the engines of his long-promised \u201cpolitical revolution.\u201d The Vermont independent senator, who caucuses with the Democrats, is tapping back into his national network of supporters. He\u2019s drawing millions of viewers for events he streams live on Facebook. And he\u2019s delivering a series of speeches designed to counter President Donald Trump and offer his own progressive vision. Taken together, his moves in 2018\u2019s first weeks show that Sanders is road-testing ways to deliver a message tailored to the Trump era without filters, and to activate his supporters behind it \u2013 even as he insists publicly and privately that it\u2019s too early to commit to a 2020 presidential run. \u201cWe are starting to see the beginning of a political revolution, something long overdue,\u201d Sanders declared after scanning the progressive anti-Trump resistance in his live-to-Facebook response to Trump\u2019s State of the Union this week. There is ample reason to doubt a Sanders 2020 run: He\u2019d be 79 years old on election day. His wife, Jane Sanders, is embroiled in a federal investigation into a land deal she made while president of Burlington College. And an awkward clash with a local newspaper reporter showed that Sanders may be uncomfortable entering the race as a front-runner, where the scrutiny is more intense and impossible to control. But the next presidential race is on the minds of Sanders\u2019 allies. A number of top aides involved in his 2016 campaign huddled recently and discussed what a 2020 presidential run would look like \u2013 a meeting first reported by Politico. Still, Sanders\u2019 camp insists he\u2019s focused now on helping Democrats \u2013 particularly like-minded progressives \u2013 win this year, in hopes of stymieing Trump for the latter half of his first term. \u201cThat\u2019s really where his head is at, is \u2018How do we put a check on the President?\u2019\u201d said Jeff Weaver, Sanders\u2019 2016 campaign manager. \u201cFor everybody who is horrified about what this White House is trying to do, having a Democratic-controlled Congress \u2013 even one house of Congress \u2013 would be a tremendous check.\u201d Sanders intends to travel extensively to support progressive candidates. First up, aides said, is likely a Midwestern trip where Sanders would campaign for three Democratic House contenders: Chuy Garcia in Illinois, Sanders presidential campaign veteran Pete D\u2019Alessandro in Iowa and Randy Bryce, who is challenging House Speaker Paul Ryan in Wisconsin. For the midterms, Sanders also plans to re-activate his \u201cdistributed organizing network\u201d of supporters \u2013 the massive network of volunteers who made tens of millions of calls and texts for his presidential campaign \u2013 to help Democrats Sanders supports. Such a trial run would be a luxury if he were to run for president in 2020. Sanders\u2019 2016 campaign started as a shoestring operation and expanded on the fly as he gained momentum; he\u2019d enter 2020 with an infrastructure and network far larger than those of any other Democrat, and with many of the kinks already worked out. Since the 2016 election, Sanders has also built a massive collection of Facebook videos \u2013 and is now beginning to host his own live events, circumventing the mainstream political press while attracting massive audiences. Most clips are short \u2013 between one and three minutes. His staff posts as many as five videos a day \u2013 often just packaging, adding context and slapping a logo onto Sanders\u2019 remarks in TV interviews or at public events. Sanders brought on NowThis News\u2019 Armand Aviram to help produce them. And, spokesman Josh Miller-Lewis said, the senator personally weighs in on the videos\u2019 content \u201call the time. It\u2019s one of his biggest areas of focus.\u201d The short videos are posted on his Senate Facebook page, which has 7.5 million followers. (His campaign page has another 5 million.) They get attention \u2013 combined, his \u201cMedicare for all\u201d-focused videos have more than 100 million views since August. But the biggest events are Sanders\u2019 livestreams. He drew 1.1 million live viewers for a \u201cMedicare for all\u201d town hall in January \u2013 an evening audience that rivaled cable news networks \u2013 and 2 million viewers total. His State of the Union response got 1 million total viewers. Sanders has partnered with progressive online news outlets to air his events. He\u2019s also launched his own podcast. He\u2019s also making sweeping speeches focused on topics far removed from Trump-focused news cycles. On Wednesday, Sanders delivered a speech focused on climate change \u2013 a notable omission in both Trump\u2019s State of the Union and Massachusetts Rep. Joe Kennedy III\u2019s official Democratic response. Kennedy responds to Trump: 'We all feel the fault lines of a fractured country' But while Sanders is most comfortable talking about his bread-and-butter issues \u2013 Medicare for all, climate change, college affordability and income inequality \u2013 he\u2019s also taking Trump on in cultural terms. At a Latino Victory Fund event this week, Sanders labeled the Trump White House \u201cthe most extremist, reactionary, xenophobic, bigoted and thankfully, in many ways, the most inept and incompetent administration in the history of our country.\u201d \u201cWhat Trump and his friends are trying to do is exploit old fracture lines in our society \u2013 racism, sexism, homophobia, Islamophobia, religious bigotry,\u201d he said. \u201cIn these dismal times, it is more important now than ever that we offer a vision to the American people \u2013 a vision of hope; a vision of what this nation can become.\u201d",

            "article_content": "The Justice Department filed a notice Friday to re-try Democratic New Jersey Sen. Bob Menendez on federal bribery and corruption charges. An 11-week trial last fall resulted in a hung jury. Prosecutors had accused the senator of accepting bribes from Dr. Salomon Melgen, a wealthy ophthalmologist in Florida, in return for political favors. Menendez and Melgen pleaded not guilty to all charges. In a statement, the Justice Department requested the court set \u201cthe earliest possible date\u201d for the new trial. \u201cSen. Menendez and Dr. Melgen were indicted in the District of New Jersey on charges that included conspiracy, bribery, and honest services fraud,\u201d the department said. \u201cThe decision to retry this case was made based on the facts and the law, following a careful review.\u201d The retrial could become a major headache for Democrats in the 2018 midterm elections. Menendez is running for re-election this year despite his legal trouble and already has become a punching bag for national Republicans, who have sought to tie him to other Democrats on the ballot this year. Three Republicans are running to oppose Menendez, including Jeff Bell, the party\u2019s nominee against Democrat Cory Booker in 2014, and Army veteran Rich Pezzullo. Menendez\u2019s seat could still be safe in his blue state: No Republicans currently facing Menendez have shown any serious fundraising efforts, and Menendez has $3.9 million in the bank, according to his latest campaign finance report. Republicans, however, have had recent success in the state. Though former GOP Gov. Chris Christie exited with record low approval ratings, he was elected twice. In last year\u2019s gubernatorial election, Democrat Phil Murphy won by 13 percentage points \u2013 a high mark that Menendez is unlikely to top. Democrats who closely watched Menendez\u2019s first trial as they weighed bids for his office, including former Sen. Bob Torricelli, ultimately decided against challenging him in the party\u2019s primary. \u201cTo those who were digging my political grave so that they could jump into my seat, I know who you are, and I won\u2019t forget you,\u201d Menendez said after the hung jury in November. On Friday the senator\u2019s office issued a statement batting away the case against Menendez as baseless. \u201cWe regret that the DOJ, after spending millions and millions of taxpayer dollars, and failing to prove a single allegation in a court of law, has decided to double down on an unjust prosecution,\u201d the statement read. \u201cEvidently, they did not hear the overwhelming voices of the New Jerseyans who served on the jury this fall. Sen. Menendez fully intends to be vindicated \u2013 again.\u201d November\u2019s mistrial was a serious blow to the Justice Department, which has investigated Menendez for nearly five years. After the trial ended, one juror told reporters the jury was split 10-2 on all counts in favor of acquittal. At the time, the senator said he felt vindicated. \u201cI want to thank the jury, 12 New Jerseyans who saw through the government\u2019s false claims and used their Jersey common sense to reject it,\u201d he told reporters outside the courthouse, before blasting the Justice Department. \u201cThe way this case started was wrong, the way it was investigated was wrong, the way it was prosecuted was wrong and the way it was tried was wrong as well,\u201d he said. \u201cCertain elements of the FBI and of our state cannot understand or, even worse, accept that the Latino kid from Union City and Hudson County can grow up and be a US senator and be honest.\u201d Shortly after the mistrial, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, called for a Senate Ethics Committee investigation. Menendez faced charges of conspiracy, bribery and honest services fraud related to allegedly abusing the power of his office that could have carried decades in prison. Prosecutors said Menendez pressured high-level officials in the Obama administration and other career diplomats to help Melgen resolve his business disputes in exchange for political contributions, a luxurious hotel suite at the Park Hyatt in Paris and free rides on Melgen\u2019s private jet that Menendez failed to report on his Senate disclosure form. Defense lawyers argued that Menendez and Melgen were longtime friends with no corrupt intent to commit a federal crime. RELATED: Bob Menendez charges, explained Kirk Ogrosky, an attorney for Melgen, said they are \u201cdisappointed that this Justice Department would re-try the case.\u201d \u201cAnyone who watched the testimony, reviewed the exhibits, and spoke to the jurors and the alternates in the first trial knows that this prosecution was ridiculous and should never have been brought,\u201d Ogrosky added. Prosecutors relied mostly on circumstantial evidence to prove their case \u2013 spending the opening weeks of the trial painting a jet-setting lifestyle of the rich and powerful before ultimately turning to the \u201cofficial acts\u201d they argued Menendez did to help his friend. They accused the senator of pushing officials to help resolve an $8.9 million Medicare billing dispute in Melgen\u2019s favor, while the defense team claimed at trial that Menendez was focused on the fact that the billing policies at issue were conflicting and the drug companies were enjoying a windfall. Similarly, when several State Department witnesses testified that Menendez had threatened to hold a congressional hearing if they did not intervene in a contract dispute between Melgen and the Dominican Republic over cargo screening at the nation\u2019s ports, the defense said the senator was troubled by port security more generally.

Cory Booker and Kamala Harris both joined the Senate Judiciary Committee Our weekly roundup of the news, notes and chatter about the prospects for the next Democratic presidential race: Now that the Oprah Winfrey for president idea has had a few days to breathe, we\u2019re getting a look at how she\u2019d fare against President Donald Trump: An NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll out Friday morning has her up, 50% to Trump\u2019s 39%. That\u2019s no surprise. Winfrey performs well with college-educated white voters and young voters \u2014 groups that have abandoned Trump in droves and would be likely to support almost any opponent right now. The Atlantic\u2019s Ron Brownstein smartly points out that Trump\u2019s approval rating is, for now, a better barometer. What is surprising is just how seriously many Democrats take the idea of a Winfrey candidacy. Many believe it\u2019s not crazy, and she could win. Jerry Crawford, a longtime veteran of Iowa presidential politics who was the Midwest co-chair of Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2008 campaign, recalled watching in amazement as Winfrey electrified Iowa crowds campaigning for Barack Obama in late 2007. \u201cIf she actually got into this race, it\u2019s pretty hard to see how she wouldn\u2019t be one of three at the end of the day coming out of Iowa,\u201d Crawford said. The alternative view is that, while the reaction to Winfrey\u2019s Golden Globes speech Sunday night was understandable, Democrats need someone with a deep grasp of policy to unwind the Trump years. \u201cWe are so starved for competence and inspiration that the undeniable brilliance of that speech just swept people up,\u201d said former Iowa Democratic Party chairwoman Sue Dvorsky. \u201cAnd I get the argument that (Trump) broke open the door for the inexperienced but well known, but I\u2019m in the camp that we go back to someone who knows what the hell they\u2019re doing.\u201d BIDEN\u2019S \u2018SHITHOLE\u2019 RESPONSE: Former Vice President Joe Biden criticized President Donald Trump\u2019s remark about \u201cshithole countries,\u201d tweeting: \u201cIt\u2019s not how a president should speak. It\u2019s not how a president should behave. Most of all, it\u2019s not what a president should believe. We\u2019re better than this.\u201d This week Biden \u2014 a potential 2020 candidate himself \u2014 praised another possible contender, Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti, in an interview at a Los Angeles Times event this week. \u201cEric Garcetti is smart as hell. He is strategic, and Eric Garcetti understands what the future looks a little bit like,\u201d he said. Biden also praised Oprah Winfrey, calling her an \u201cincredibly bright, decent, appealing person\u201d but saying she\u2019d need to develop some foreign policy experience if she wants to be president. \u201cI\u2019d be happy to be on either one of their tickets,\u201d Biden joked about Garcetti and Winfrey. \u201cI\u2019m a good vice president.\u201d What about Biden himself? \u201cThere will be a Biden president, and the name is likely to be Finnegan Biden,\u201d he said, referring to one of his granddaughters. BERNIE GOES DIRECT TO THE GRASSROOTS: Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders is holding a town hall focused on his \u201cMedicare for all\u201d plan. It\u2019s happening January 23, for 90 minutes beginning at 7 p.m., and will be live streamed on NowThis, ATTN:, and The Young Turks\u2019 social media channels. The medium here is, for one night at least, at least as important as the message. The Young Turks in particular have backed Sanders from early on in his 2016 bid, so this is a chance to chat with a friendly crowd and keep his base engaged and focused on Sanders\u2019 favorite issue, and one of the most popular with progressives. The Capitol Visitor Center\u2019s Congressional Auditorium in Washington will host the event. CORY AND KAMALA GET NEW GIGS: California Sen. Kamala Harris and New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker will be joining the Senate Judiciary Committee, making them \u2014 per a Washington Post report \u2014 the first African-American members to sit on the panel in the 21st century. The positions will further elevate another the already high-profile pair, giving them an even bigger stage and new responsibilities vetting judicial nominees and Justice Department appointments. And, if Democrats\u2019 worst nightmare comes true and a Supreme Court seat comes open, Booker and Harris will have the opportunity to cross-examine a Trump nominee on the national stage. Harris posted this picture of the pair on Instagram. \u2014 Another note on Harris: She\u2019s growing a reputation as a leading voice on Capitol Hill for recipients of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals programs. She \u201chas been a complete game-changer for advocates who work on this,\u201d Alida Garcia, coalitions and policy direct at Fwd.us, told McClatchy\u2019s Emily Cadei. The Washington Post\u2019s Jeff Stein succinctly captured on Twitter why this could be a powerful issue for a 2020 Harris campaign. FIGHTIN\u2019 WORDS FROM THE MACKER: Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe, who will be off the clock when Gov.-elect Ralph Northam gets sworn in Saturday, is making the most of his last few days in office. On Thursday night he told MSNBC\u2019s Chris Matthews that, if he just so happened to find himself in a debate with Trump and the President invaded his personal space, well, \u201cYou\u2019d have to pick him up off the floor.\u201d (And yes, that means what it sounds like.) McAuliffe was also on Jonathan Capehart\u2019s podcast, where he touted Virginia\u2019s drop to 3.6% unemployment. Asked by Capehart about his future, the Macker sounded like a candidate: \u201cI don\u2019t want people talking about 2020 for anybody,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause I am petrified about 2018.\u201d DE BLASIO VS. THE OIL GIANTS: New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio is taking aim at the fossil fuel industry. New York this week became the largest American city to sue the world\u2019s largest oil companies, reports CNNMoney\u2019s Matt Egan. ExxonMobil, Chevron, BP, Royal Dutch Shell and ConocoPhillips are in the crosshairs as part of lawsuit demanding the companies foot the bill for protecting the city from the effects of climate change. There also plans now for the city to divest itself from fossil fuel reserve owners in the next five years. \u201cIt\u2019s time for Big Oil to take responsibility for the devastation they have wrought,\u201d de Blasio said during a news conference, adding: \u201cWe are going to lead the fight against climate change as if our lives depended on it \u2014 because they do.\u201d SPENDING HIS WAY INTO DEMOCRATIC HEARTS? Billionaire megadonor Tom Steyer, who\u2019d flirted with a Senate run in California, says he isn\u2019t running 2018. Instead, he\u2019s pledged to spend $30 million as part of an effort to retake the House from Republicans. Steyer will pump the money into his NextGen America group\u2019s youth program, which is aimed at organizing and turning out millennial voters. He also bought a copy of \u201cFire and Fury\u201d for every member of Congress. He\u2019s also \u201cdoubling\u201d his national advertising campaign to get Trump impeached, which has so far cost him $20 million, but helped build a massive email list. ANOTHER BILLIONAIRE FLIRTS WITH A FUTURE RUN: Billionaire Mike Bloomberg was asked by MSNBC on Thursday whether he could consider a 2020 bid. Bloomberg said no, sort of \u2014 grabbing hold of the word \u201ccould\u201d to deflect the question. \u201cI suppose I could. You have to be 35 years old. I am older than that. You have be a citizen. I am a citizen. Have to be born in America. I was,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I have no plans to run for president.\u201d Connecticut Sen. Chris Murphy is up for re-election this year and begins with a war chest of $7 million. He raised $10.4 million in 2017, including $1.5 million in the year\u2019s final quarter, according to his latest campaign finance filing. \u2026 Former Missouri Secretary of State Jason Kander is headlining a January 24 fundraiser for Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown in Cleveland. Tickets range from $25 for students to $125. \u2026 Former President Barack Obama talked to David Letterman about Malia Obama\u2019s college move-in day and more. CNN\u2019s Ashley Killough, Saba Hamedy, Rebecca Berg and Sophie Tatum contributed to this memo.",

            "article_content": "Trump's physical is set for Friday There is little to indicate the check-up will provide much clarity about the state of Trump's mind President Donald Trump\u2019s staunch defense of his own mental acuity this weekend all but ensured the questions mounting about his fitness will increase in the coming week, which is set to culminate Friday with his first known medical exam since taking office. Coming amid a previously-unheard-of debate over the mental capacity of the country\u2019s oldest president at the time of his first election, the yearly presidential physical has attracted renewed attention from a capital now consumed with Trump\u2019s mental health. But there is little to indicate the checkup will provide much clarity about the state of Trump\u2019s mind. In a series of tweets dispatched Saturday morning from the frigid Maryland woods, where he was huddling with congressional leaders at Camp David, Trump, 71, declared himself a \u201cvery stable genius\u201d and \u201clike, really smart.\u201d Trump defends his sanity amid questions about his mental state Trump was attempting to rebut the claim made in a damaging new book that some of his aides doubt his fitness for office. But he was also speaking to the growing chorus \u2013 mostly from Democrats but also including a few Republicans \u2013 questioning his mental health. On Friday, Trump is due at the Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Maryland for a medical exam conducted by the White House physician, Dr. Ronny Jackson, who performed President Barack Obama\u2019s last several physicals while he was in office. The White House has said it will provide a readout of the exam once it\u2019s complete. Trump sets his doctor's appointment But any hopes that the publicly released information will shed light on Trump\u2019s mental state appear largely misplaced. A review of the past five presidents\u2019 physical exams show only brief mentions of mental health, and none provide a readout of mental health tests. White House press secretary Sarah Sanders declined to specify details of Trump\u2019s physical when she was asked last week whether the exam would include mental acuity tests. \u201cWe\u2019ll discuss, as I said when I announced that he was going to be doing the physical, we\u2019ll have a readout of that after that is completed and we\u2019ll let you know at that time,\u201d Sanders said. Currently, the US Preventive Services Task Force does not recommend older patients without signs of symptoms receive routine screenings for cognitive impairment or dementia, citing insufficient evidence. But the government does require doctors to ask patients over age 65 during the yearly Medicare Wellness Exam whether they\u2019ve noticed any depression or memory loss. The 71-year-old Trump is not on Medicare and not bound by the requirement. Scientists have also determined that having a parent or sibling with Alzheimer\u2019s increases the risk of developing the disease. Trump\u2019s father, Fred, whose photograph sits behind the Resolute Desk in the Oval Office, developed Alzheimer\u2019s in his 80s. What precisely will be disclosed about the President\u2019s health isn\u2019t yet clear. Trump himself will determine what information to make public, a person familiar with the process of presidential exams said. The person, who has been involved in past presidential physicals, said the White House Medical Unit typically prepares a summary to give the media after the exam is completed. Because the health information is considered private under federal law, the President himself must sign off on its release. Doctors who have performed presidential physicals in the past said the task of releasing information that is ordinarily bound by strict privacy rules can prove daunting. \u201cYou have to remember if there is something wrong with a president that kicks him out of office, everyone who comes with him leaves. So everyone wants to keep him in, they want to silence the doctor,\u201d Dr. Connie Mariano, who served as White House physician for George W. Bush and Bill Clinton, told CNN in 2015. Over the past four decades, there has been no single format for releasing information about the President\u2019s health. Typical readings have included the President\u2019s height, weight, body mass index (which indicates whether an individual is normal weight, overweight or obese), resting heart rate and blood pressure. Past exams have also included details about the commander in chief\u2019s vision, thyroid, cardiac rhythms, gastrointestinal system, skin and neurological indicators like cerebellar function, motor functions and sensory systems. Almost always, the physician conducting the exam will make a general assessment of the President\u2019s health, and declare him fit to serve in the office. Past presidents have been largely forthcoming with their medical records, including some embarrassing details like when Bill Clinton\u2019s doctor revealed he had hemorrhoids. During the 2016 campaign, Trump\u2019s longtime personal physician Dr. Harold Bornstein released a summary of Trump\u2019s health that included his height (6 feet 3 inches) and weight (236 pounds), cholesterol (HDL 63, LDL 94, triglycerides 61), blood pressure (116/70), blood sugar (99), and normal results from liver, thyroid, heart and colon exams. A review of the official White House readouts of past presidential physicals shows most paint a portrait of vigor \u2013 punctuated by details like workout routines and sports injuries \u2013 without providing details about the mental or emotional state of the patient. President George W. Bush\u2019s first physical was conducted by a panel that included a gastroenterologist, radiologist, optometrist, neurologist, orthopedist, audiologist, dermatologist, otolaryngologist, pulmonologist, urologist, cardiologist and podiatrist \u2013 but no psychiatrist or psychologist, at least one that was publicly disclosed. That doesn\u2019t mean there hasn\u2019t been concerns over a US president\u2019s behavioral health. Abraham Lincoln was described in contemporaneous accounts as suffering from \u201cmelancholy,\u201d which modern experts have said was likely clinical depression. John F. Kennedy and Richard Nixon both took medication used to treat anxiety \u2013 along with a cocktail of other stimulants and sedatives. Like with Trump, some of President Ronald Reagan\u2019s aides privately worried their boss lacked the mental fitness to carry out his job. Some considered invoking the 25th Amendment that would relieve him of power. Reagan was 73 when he was re-elected. Unlike Trump, Reagan vowed when he was candidate to undergo mental fitness testing, and told reporters that he would resign if any evidence of senility or deterioration emerged. Reagan\u2019s doctors said after he left office that they did perform some cognitive exams during his yearly physicals, including subtracting seven continually starting at 100. The results of those tests were normal, the physicians said. Reagan, who like Trump faced questions during his presidency about forgetfulness and mental slips, disclosed in 1994 that he had Alzheimer\u2019s. He and his doctors maintained he hadn\u2019t shown signs of the disease until after he left office. In defending himself against accusations of mental instability this weekend, Trump referred to his Republican forebear. \u201cThe Democrats and their lapdogs, the Fake News Mainstream Media, are taking out the old Ronald Reagan playbook,\u201d he wrote on Saturday. On Sunday, he went on: \u201cRonald Reagan had the same problem and handled it well. So will I!\u201d",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: David Axelrod, CNN senior political commentator, is host of the podcast \u201cThe Axe Files,\u201d now a regularly featured show on CNN. He was senior adviser to President Barack Obama and chief strategist for the 2008 and 2012 Obama presidential campaigns. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his. View more opinion articles on CNN.com. A few years back, when Nancy Pelosi was on my \u201cThe Axe Files\u201d podcast, I asked her what she had learned about politics as the daughter of Baltimore mayor and Democratic ward leader Thomas D\u2019Alesandro. The first and only woman to serve as speaker of the House needed no time to consider her answer. \u201cMostly, I learned how to count,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd that is really what it serves me in a good stead, whether it\u2019s about my own election or my election to leadership or my passing legislation. You really have to know how to count and what is \u2018yes,\u2019 and what is \u2018that would be nice.\u2019\u201d In the wake of the massive Democratic win in the midterm elections, Pelosi is counting again, trying to determine if she can muster the votes to make history as the only woman to recapture the gavel. It is by no means certain they will add up. After 15 years as the House Democratic leader, Pelosi bears the accumulated scars of relentless attacks from opposition ad makers and media outlets. They have turned the Californian into a cartoon character, a symbol of partisanship, liberal excess and Washington politics. In exit polls from the midterm elections, Pelosi\u2019s favorability rating stood at just 31%, 14 points lower than an embattled President Trump. Fudge: If we run on change, then we need change So toxic was Pelosi in some districts that more than a few new members of the House ran pledging to oppose her return to the speakership, even as Democratic House members benefited from the prodigious sums of money she raised to ensure their victories. Pelosi also is the target of restive younger members who are demanding a new generation of leadership in the House, where the top three Democrats all are nearing their 80s. I understand the yearning for generational change and a fresh face to lead the House. I hear the concerns that Pelosi might become a foil in Trump\u2019s reality show, an unhelpful symbol and tarnished spokesperson. But in my two years as senior adviser to President Obama, I saw Pelosi in a different light. Not only could she count, but she could be counted on to deliver on very tough votes. Pelosi was an invaluable ally and blunt counselor to the President, promising only what she could deliver and delivering everything that she promised. She read her members brilliantly and rallied a fractious caucus through many critical battles. There would have been no Affordable Care Act without Pelosi, whose strategic and tactical mastery revived a health-reform law many thought was dead. She helped deliver crucial votes for unpopular, but necessary, measures to save the economy from collapse and set it on the path to recovery. She shepherded important social and economic reforms through the Congress. Valerie Jarrett: Nancy Pelosi has the toughness Democrats need Cast by her foes as a far left, San Francisco liberal, she is, in fact, a canny and measured legislative leader who has deftly balanced the needs of her members with larger legislative and political goals. Members who ran on a pledge to dump Pelosi face a difficult choice, and if all of them hold their ground and join forces with those Democrats already in the House who have called for a new leader, Pelosi will be denied.  To have a chance, Pelosi will have to make concessions: perhaps term limits for committee chairs or other steps to allow younger, talented members to advance in the House; a new leadership team that includes members who are not yet Medicare-eligible to whom she would delegate most of her TV chores; and an explicit promise of transition. But given this challenging moment in history, Democrats should think twice about throwing over her experience \u2013 and Trump should hope they choose someone else. There is no obvious, better choice to navigate the next two years with wily Mitch McConnell in control of the Senate and an erratic, tempestuous president in the White House. In 1940, Britain turned to Winston Churchill, a flawed, aging but steely leader, to lead it through its existential crisis. When victory was won, British voters dispatched him. Nancy Pelosi is surely not the leader of the future. But the savvy septuagenarian is the battle-tested leader best suited for today.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: CNN political commentator Robby Mook ran the 2015-16 presidential campaign for Hillary Clinton and is now a senior fellow at Harvard University. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his. View more opinion at CNN. With the midterms behind us, the 2020 floodgates are about to open. You can expect senators, governors, members of Congress, mayors, movie stars, CEOs (and even a porn star\u2019s lawyer?) to start kicking the tires on a presidential run \u2014 and announce they\u2019re getting into the race. The one thing we know about the likely candidates is that we don\u2019t know anything. It will be the most wide-open field in our lifetime. After working in the last three competitive Democratic presidential primaries and going through extensive planning and preparation for Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 run, I\u2019d recommend that candidates consider these five things as they plan: Set a stopwatch for 20 minutes, grab a piece of paper and answer the following questions in no more than three sentences each: Did you know the answers? Are they clear and concise? Are they real ideas? Or just a bunch of rhetoric? If the answers to these questions come easily, you have a rationale for running. If not, I recommend figuring them out before you jump in the fray \u2014 or maybe it\u2019s not your time. And don\u2019t try to find any of this in a poll. This part has to come from you. If I\u2019d written a column in November 2014 that read, \u201cIn the 2016 primary, a 75-year-old congressman who spent most of his adult life in elected office will emerge as an anti-establishment crusader rallying millennials to his cause,\u201d you would have laughed at me. Yet that\u2019s exactly what happened. Midterm results that will shape America's future Bernie Sanders, who had been a member of Congress for 25 years, emerged as an outsider in the race. It\u2019s not who you are, but what you stand for that matters. Bernie didn\u2019t attract young people because he was young. It was about his ideas. Your campaign is a vehicle for your supporters to create change and your message is a rallying cry for your cause. Talking about yourself \u2014 your accomplishments and the kind of leader you have been \u2014 is fine as part of a story that illuminates your values, but your message is ultimately about a diagnosis of what\u2019s wrong, a vision of who we are as a country and where we need to go. Many candidates fall into the trap of trying to sell themselves. Instead, sell what you stand for. Also, ignore the polls right now. When I first arrived in Manchester, New Hampshire, to work for Howard Dean\u2019s 2004 presidential bid, one candidate was crushing everyone else in the polls. His name was Joe Lieberman, and we know how that turned out. The polls today are meaningless, so ignore them all. There are way too many unknowns and far too many potential candidates to read much into the data. Plus, your message has to come from you. The Democratic primary electorate wants change. Some people think that change is represented by certain policy positions, or a particular ideological brand. Not so. Voters are shopping for a leader, not a litany. They want you to explain where we\u2019ve been, where we are, and where we can go. They want to hear you explain what\u2019s wrong and how we can make it right. They want to know what you think \u201cAmerica\u201d stands for as an idea. Change is about more than your flavor of Medicare for All or whether you\u2019re a \u201cNew Democrat,\u201d old Democrat, Democratic Socialist, \u201cyellow dog Democrat,\u201d \u201cBlue Dog Democrat,\u201d or tabby cat Democrat. Trump is a master programmer. Democrats need a 2020 script In 2008, Barack Obama ran for a new kind of politics that transcended old divides. His positions were oftentimes more conservative than Hillary Clinton\u2019s (he opposed an individual mandate, for example), but you don\u2019t think of him that way, which is why you shouldn\u2019t get dragged down into litmus tests \u2014 stick to the \u201cvision thing.\u201d Lastly, your vision of change must be bigger than a rebuttal of Trump\u2019s latest tweet. It must be about what America looks like without those tweets altogether. Speaking for yourself and avoiding the trap of litigating the race on Trump\u2019s terms will be your biggest challenge. You will sink or swim based on the ability to mobilize fans, who will share your content and donate money. Period. That comes from having an original idea to sell and a top-notch digital operation to push your message out and mobilize supporters. You should also get in front of the press as much as you can. Both Trump and Sanders used cable news appearances in the 2016 race to build their social assets early in the process to great effect. Gone are the days of sustaining a campaign on $2,700-per-plate chicken dinners at the Marriott. There will be too many candidates and not enough time to raise money the old-fashioned way. Candidates will need a large network of low-dollar donors to sustain them for the long haul. This is how the Democrats can win in 2020 Also gone are the days of winning one state and \u201ctaking off.\u201d Yes, it\u2019s vital to build a ground game in the early states (and that includes some March states), but camping out in a single state and thinking that can catapult you onto the national stage is outdated. Without generating a fan base, you won\u2019t have the resources \u2014 money or message \u2014 to gain traction and sustain your work. When I was running Hillary\u2019s campaign in 2016, Sanders didn\u2019t build out his Iowa operation until very late in the game and quickly pulled the race to a virtual tie. Mitt Romney did not spend a significant amount of time in Iowa, and yet he came in a close second (so close that everyone believed he\u2019d won on caucus night). Donald Trump\u2019s Iowa and New Hampshire operations were a mess, yet he came in second in the Iowa caucus and handily won the New Hampshire primary. You want the best people and the best operations you can in these states, but message travels nationally nowadays \u2013 and it travels fastest via your fans. Early in the campaign, what matters is honing your message, building your base of fans and pulling off  the strongest possible result in the early states. That foundation makes everything else possible. But what ultimately wins the contest is delegates \u2013 and delegates don\u2019t always come in logical ways. Some candidates get so fixated on the first four states, which have less than 4% of the overall delegates, that they forget to plan and end up short come Super Tuesday. Others fall into the trap of thinking \u201cwinning states\u201d is the same as \u201cwinning delegates\u201d and it\u2019s more complicated than that. First, the media reports primary contests just like any other election, except they\u2019re not. When you see results come in on primary night, they\u2019re presented as they would  be in any other election contest: Candidate A gets X percent, Candidate B gets Y percent. Then the press celebrates the \u201cwinner.\u201d But these voting figures are often meaningless and the celebrations are almost always deceptive, because you win the primary with delegates, not votes \u2014 and the two are not as correlated as you might suspect. If Trump was this bad in 2018, what about 2020? When I ran Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2008 primary campaign in Ohio, we won the state with 53% of the vote, to much fanfare. Obama, who won 44%, trailed by a margin of about 200,000 votes. But we only gained a net of seven delegates over Obama. Compare that to Kansas, where Obama gained a net of 14 delegates with a margin of about 17,000 votes. Clinton won a bigger state with a margin that was nearly 12 times the size, but she got half the delegates. The lesson: Votes do not equal delegates, especially when comparing caucuses and primaries. You don\u2019t even have to win the most votes to get the most delegates. When I ran the Nevada caucus for Hillary in 2008, we \u201cwon\u201d with 50.8% of the precinct delegates to Obama\u2019s 45.1%, but Obama actually won 13 unpledged delegates \u2013 one more than Clinton\u2019s 12 \u2013 because of how the delegates were proportioned by congressional district. Likewise, in 2016, Clinton and Sanders split the delegates in Wyoming evenly 7-7, despite Bernie \u201cwinning\u201d the precinct caucuses 55.7% to 44.3%. Lastly, don\u2019t forget the rule that requires Democratic primary candidates to secure at least 15% of the vote in order to win delegates. With such a big field, you\u2019ll see a lot of people stall out early because they won\u2019t score enough votes to win any.  Only three of eight candidates in the 2008 Democratic primary won any delegates at all \u2013 and John Edwards ended up with less than 1%. Once someone has pulled ahead in the delegate count on Super Tuesday it\u2019s virtually impossible for others to catch up, not just because of money and momentum, but because the rules push underdogs out (although with online fundraising, candidates can choose to stay in long after they\u2019re not viable). So never lose focus of what it really takes to win: getting the most delegates. We say it every four years, but I don\u2019t think anyone would disagree \u2013 this really is the most important presidential election in our history \u2014 and the playbook will look totally different this time around. But recent campaigns give us some clues as to what contributes to success: an authentic rationale for running, a message that rallies supporters, and fans who are mobilized both on the ground and online.

It\u2019s the best of times and the worst of times for independent voters and candidates. With Washington bitterly polarized, the need to break out of the divisive duopoly of Republican and Democrat has never been clearer \u2013 especially for those folks who used to consider themselves on the center-right. Nebraska Senator Ben Sasse spoke for many when he said on CNN\u2019s New Day in September that he thinks about leaving the GOP \u201cevery morning when I wake up,\u201d adding that \u201cneither of these parties are for very much more than being anti.\u201d But those forces of negative partisanship that Sasse describes are precisely what\u2019s making it tougher for independent candidates running for office in 2018. Trump voter now campaigns for Dems in midterms While the most prominent independent elected official in the nation, Senator Angus King from Maine, is cruising toward re-election, the country\u2019s only independent governor \u2013 Alaska\u2019s Bill Walker \u2013 suspended his re-election campaign last month and endorsed Democrat Mark Begich to stop Republicans from winning the statehouse. Donald Trump\u2019s hyperpartisan approach to the presidency is making many independent voters move decisively toward Democrats in 2018. CNN\u2019s new election-eve poll shows independent voters breaking for Democrats in the midterms, 53 to 39% \u2013 a 14-point margin. That\u2019s in line with independents\u2019 shift toward Democrats in the wave-election of 2006 and Republicans in the 2010 Tea Party wave \u2013 and it\u2019s another indication of independents\u2019 preference for the checks and balances that come from divided government. This final-stretch focus is a reminder that independents are the balance of power in American politics. But their influence is diluted by Washington\u2019s obsession with politics that play to the base. As the two parties have become more ideologically polarized over the past three decades, independent voters have grown from about 35% of the electorate in 1990 to averaging about 42% this year, while Democrats and Republicans hover just south of the 30% mark. Trump voter: Afraid of dictator in White House And according to the University of Virginia Center for Politics, there are 10 states where registered Independents outnumber Democrats or Republicans, including the pivotal presidential swing states of Iowa, New Hampshire and Colorado. While independents are the clear plurality in American politics \u2013 and 35% of Americans identify as moderate in a 2018 Gallup survey \u2013 many centrist candidates and voters feel politically homeless in the current environment. Center-right senators like Republicans Jeff Flake and Bob Corker were essentially forced into retirement because of their principled criticisms of President Trump, which made partisan primaries seem like losing bets, despite their being strong general election candidates. Unfortunately for the nation, both men chose not to pursue the path that Alaska\u2019s Senator Lisa Murkowski did in 2006, when she successfully persisted with an independent candidacy after losing a primary to a Tea Partier. Centrist Democrats like West Virgina  Senator Joe Manchin are in a stronger position in their party, but the energy is increasingly from candidates on the left adopting  more liberal positions \u2013 like Medicare for All. Against this backdrop, more candidates are trying their hand at independent candidacies. In Kansas, independent Greg Orman is running in a three-way race for governor after nearly winning a Senate seat as an independent in 2014. I spoke to him at the outset of his campaign and he made the case in terms that resonate with independents across the nation: voters are \u201csick and tired of extreme partisanship.\u201d Voter: Kavanaugh debate has energized women \u201cThe two parties seem more interested in seeing the other party fail than they (are in) seeing our state or our country succeed,\u201d he said, \u201cso I think as an independent I would really have the ability to embrace the best ideas.\u201d But with Trump crowding the national conversation, centrist Republicans in Kansas have been backing Democratic State Senator Laura Kelly over right-wing Trump-hugging Republican Kris Kobach, the current secretary of state. The Colorado-based group Unite America \u2013 formerly known as the Centrist Project \u2013 has been backing Orman\u2019s effort, along with independent candidacies across the country, including Maryland Senate candidate Neal Simon, Maine gubernatorial candidate Terry Hayes and California Insurance Commissioner Steve Poizner, along with a handful of state legislative candidates. The Serve America Movement \u2013 which offers an alternative to the parties \u2013 is advancing a similar agenda, fielding a compelling candidate in a longshot bid for New York governor, Stephanie Miner, who had previously been a popular two-term mayor of Syracuse. \u201cBecause of the hyperpartisanship that we\u2019re seeing now, there\u2019s no problem solving \u2013 it\u2019s just name-calling and rewarding special interests,\u201d she told me. \u201cAs a mayor you cannot engage in this talking-point, 30 seconds accusations.  You have to really fundamentally solve problems. \u2026 I am fiscally responsible but also believe in people being able to make their own decisions about their lifestyles and how they live their lives.\u201d  This fiscally responsible but socially liberal framework is what unites many independents and centrists. It is a common-sense combination that is out of step with the base of both parties. President Trump\u2019s polarizing of the electorate has created a sense of urgency that\u2019s making it difficult for independent candidates to find oxygen this election cycle. But with this polarization likely to get worse in the coming years, independents\u2019 ambitious efforts might simply be ahead of their time. Breaking through this bitter and divisive climate will ultimately require new coalitions to depolarize our politics. Independent voters and candidates are rebelling against the rigid polarization of our politics. They recognize that we need to put country over party to overcome the tribalism that\u2019s diminishing our democracy in the eyes of the world. And that\u2019s really a cause worth fighting for.",

The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion articles on CNN. On Tuesday night, all eyes will be on the 12th Congressional District in Ohio. The district lies smack in the middle of the Buckeye state, winding through parts of seven of the state\u2019s 88 counties. It looks a lot like the salamander-shaped district drawn by then-Massachusetts governor Elbridge Gerry that bequeathed the name \u201cgerrymander\u201d (with a hard \u201cg,\u201d by the way) to contemporary American political discourse. When it was drawn by the Republican-dominated Ohio legislature in 2011, the intention was to create, or really to maintain, a safe seat for the Republican Congressman Pat Tiberi. As expected, Tiberi had no trouble holding the seat, garnering about two-thirds of votes cast in his last three campaigns. This past October, however, Tiberi, a moderate Republican and close ally of Ohio Governor John Kasich, announced he would not complete his term, opting to leave Congress to take over as president of the Ohio Business Roundtable. And so voters in his district must now head to the polls to elect someone to serve in his place until the end of the year. Last week, a Monmouth University poll showed the race between Republican Troy Balderson and Democrat Danny O\u2019Connor to be a dead heat. On Monday, a second poll showed O\u2019Connor to be ahead by a point. And yet polls taken a little over a month ago showed a comfortable lead for Balderson of between 9 and 11 points. These polls have caught the attention of analysts because this district is not supposed to be competitive, and the unexpected weakness of the GOP candidate fits into a broader argument that Trump\u2019s low approval numbers are turning voters against the GOP, even in previously safe Republican districts. The problem with this explanation, at least in Ohio\u2019s 12th district, is that a poll taken last month by Monmouth that showed Balderson ahead by 9 points recorded virtually the same approval/disapproval numbers for Trump. If Balderson\u2019s downturn is tied to Trump, one would expect their numbers to drop together. Since June, Trump\u2019s disapproval numbers have gone up by 2 points, while Balderson\u2019s disapproval numbers have doubled. If Balderson does poorly on Tuesday night, an alternative explanation is available. From the start, Balderson has been seen as the establishment Republican candidate in this race. A member of the Ohio Senate, he was endorsed by the incumbent Pat Tiberi, and was thought to be favored by Republican governor (and Trump antagonist) Kasich. The fact that the usually outspoken Ohio governor declined to weigh in on Balderson\u2019s behalf during the primary is telling (although Kasich has since endorsed the Republican nominee). It is likely that Kasich understood that his explicit endorsement might be the kiss of death among Trump loyalists in the district. Balderson\u2019s connections to \u201cthe swamp\u201d were driven home by his opponent in the May Republican primary, Melanie Leneghan. It was Leneghan, and not Balderson, who received the endorsement of the founder of the Freedom Caucus, Jim Jordan, and its current chair, Mark Meadows. Leneghan also received the endorsement of one of Trump\u2019s most prominent supporters in Ohio, former Secretary of State and Republican gubernatorial candidate Ken Blackwell. Trouble still ahead for GOP -- even with a growing economy And the battle between Leneghan and Balderson was anything but quiet. Not counting outside spending, Balderson and Leneghan spent nearly $2 million attacking each other. In the end, Balderson won by less than 1% of the total vote. In contrast, Danny O\u2019Connor, Balderson\u2019s opponent on Tuesday, bested his nearest opponent in the Democratic contest by nearly 25 percentage points. So, rather than losing support from establishment Republicans who are turning on Trump, it is more likely that Balderson is suffering from a lack of support among Trump loyalists. Why else would Trump feel the need to not only travel to Ohio this past Saturday night to campaign for Balderson, but to choose as his venue Leneghan\u2019s home county, and then go out of his way to assure his supporters that Balderson \u201cwas always my first choice?\u201d Danny O\u2019Connor, Balderson\u2019s Democratic opponent, is a relative newcomer to politics. Only 31 years old, O\u2019Connor was elected to the fairly low-profile position of Franklin County Recorder in 2016. It is difficult to not notice the similarities between O\u2019Connor and Conor Lamb, the Democrat who took down Republican Rick Saccone in a similar Republican district in Pennsylvania this past March. Like Lamb, O\u2019Connor pitches himself as a moderate Democrat, emphasizing his support for Social Security and Medicare, while pledging to vote against Nancy Pelosi for Speaker of the House, should the Democrats take over next year.  Since this is a district that Trump won by 11 points in 2016, anything less than a clear victory for Balderson on Tuesday will be spun as a defeat for the Republican Party, and further evidence of a coming Blue Wave in November. If Democrats win or keep the margins close, they will, if nothing else, force Republicans to spend a great deal of money in November trying to take back or keep a district that on paper should not be competitive. Still, no matter what happens on Tuesday, be wary about drawing any conclusions about the larger national narrative. Also, realize that a special election taking place in August is very different from a midterm election in November. After all, there is a reason why television networks broadcast mainly reruns during the summer. People are away on vacation and otherwise distracted by outdoor activities. Turnout will be very different. Nothing that happens on Tuesday will change that fact.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Jeffrey Sachs is a professor and director of the Center for Sustainable Development at Columbia University. The opinions expressed in this commentary are those of the author; view more opinion articles on CNN. The economics of Medicare for All championed by Sen. Bernie Sanders are actually quite straightforward. Under what advocates call \u201cM4A,\u201d health care coverage would expand while total spending on health care \u2013 by companies, individuals and the government \u2013 would decline because of lower costs. More would be paid through the government and less through private insurers. M4A would reduce health care costs for three reasons. First, Medicare pays hospital and doctors at lower rates than private insurers. Second, drug prices would be lower. And third, there would be administrative savings. These conclusions are robust. Recently, the libertarian-leaning Mercatus Center published a study with data that bear out these conclusions. Indeed, these sensible conclusions jump out of any straightforward analysis. M4A would seem to be an unbeatable approach. And indeed it is \u2013 almost. It\u2019s basically the solution adopted by Canada, the countries of Western Europe, Japan, Australia and New Zealand. Yet one high-income country does it differently: the United States, which still relies heavily \u2013 far too heavily \u2013 on private health insurers. The main reason why the United States continues with a broken system is straightforward. The US private health care industry is enormously profitable and powerful. M4A would help the nation but hurt the owners, top managers and highest-paid health providers of the private health care industry. Thus, the health care lobby blocks M4A \u2013 though it would greatly benefit the nation. (Free-market ideologues, including the Mercatus Center, oppose M4A because it would enlarge government, even though it would both expand health coverage and reduce costs. More government, in the free-market view, is bad even if it is more cost-effective.) Big pharma's cash flood is drowning seniors The challenge in adopting M4A is not really about whether it would be a better system. Yes it would be. It is about political muscle. The health care lobby is the biggest one in the country, with lobbying outlays of a whopping $557 million in 2017, including $280 million by pharmaceutical and health products companies, $103 million by hospitals and nursing homes, $92 million by health professionals and $82 million by health services and HMOs, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Those princely sums add up to a lot of votes in Congress. The lobbyists get a very good return on their political investments, to the detriment of almost all Americans. Americans spent an average of $10,300 per person on health care in 2017, about twice the average of comparable countries. Those excessive outlays pay for the ridiculously high earnings in the health care system. According to recently published data, 17 CEOs of not-for-profit hospitals, for example, were paid more than $5 million each in 2014. And that\u2019s just the not-for-profit sector. America's health is declining -- and corporations are stoking this crisis Americans know well the dismaying case of a medicine like sofosbuvir (trade name Sovaldi), a cure for Hepatitis C, that cost about $1 to produce yet was originally sold for $1,000 per pill, with the monopoly power of patents and the protection of an absurd law that blocks the government from negotiating prices with the private pharmaceutical industry. The current system is an outrage, and Americans express less satisfaction with the health care system than do their counterparts abroad. And yet it doesn\u2019t change. The health care lobby has been too strong, successfully playing on the public\u2019s fear of change and the fear of too many incumbent politicians of crossing a powerful lobby. Vital facts are routinely obscured from the public. Consider the recent Mercatus study. On the one hand, it rightfully and straightforwardly concludes that M4A would provide more health care coverage at lower cost than the status quo, projecting a net reduction in national health expenditures of roughly $2 trillion over a 10-year period (2022-2031), while also enabling increased health care coverage. Yet the study actually portrays this outcome in frightening terms, as simply a great expansion in the size of government and taxes: \u201cDoubling all currently projected federal individual and corporate income tax collections would be insufficient to finance the added federal costs of the plan.\u201d Paul Ryan's plans for Medicare are scary The simple retort, of course, is that the reduction of private-insurance premiums would more than offset the rise in the public sector costs (hence the overall net saving). Yet this fundamental point is buried in the report\u2019s rhetoric. It would not be hard to design the new taxes, perhaps as payroll taxes rather than income taxes, so that almost all workers would see a net reduction of their health care costs (with the elimination of private-insurance premiums more than offsetting the rise in taxes). The Mercatus report fails to emphasize three crucial facts: First, US health care is not a competitive marketplace. It is rife with monopoly power, enabling the extraordinary markups of drug prices, the extravagant salaries of the top-paid health care providers and the rampant price discrimination exercised by health providers, which charge different prices to different clients depending on the provider\u2019s market power vis-\u00e0-vis different clienteles. M4A would limit this monopoly power by putting a powerful government payer up against the monopolists. Second, US health care prices are sky-high compared with the prices paid in other high-income countries, while US health outcomes are worse. Life expectancy in the United States is not only around five years lower than in the leading countries but has actually been declining in the past two years, in part because of epidemics of depression, suicide and substance abuse. Third, M4A wouldn\u2019t require the United States to plunge into an unknown health care model. Medicare already ensures lower costs than private health care and is popular among the elderly. The health systems of every other high-income country offer other proven models. Par for the course, the Mercatus study doesn\u2019t even mention the overwhelming evidence from abroad.  By looking more carefully abroad we would learn that M4A can save far more than $2 trillion over 10 years. The savings could actually approach $1 trillion per year, given that the United States would save even more than that amount per year were it to pay the same share of gross domestic product on health care as does Canada with its single-payer system (10.4% of GDP in Canada, compared with 17.1% in the United States, for 2017). Even with that lower rate of spending, Canada achieves a higher proportion of health care coverage and a longer life expectancy (81.9 years, compared with 78.6 years in the United States, for 2017). Sanders nearly won the Democratic nomination in 2016 by taking M4A to the people despite the naysaying of the Democratic Party establishment and newspaper pundits. With health care premiums continuing to soar, and with Donald Trump and the Republican Congress aiming to cut back even further on health care coverage, the public backing for M4A is sure to surge by the presidential election in 2020.",
