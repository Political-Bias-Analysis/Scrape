            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Jonathan Rynhold is director of the Argov Center for the Study of Israel and the Jewish People at Bar-Ilan University, Israel. He has co-edited several books on Israeli elections. His latest book is \u201cThe Arab-Israeli Conflict in American Political Culture.\u201d The views expressed are his own.\u200b Israel holds parliamentary elections on Tuesday Jonathan Rynhold: Despite polls, peace and security key issue The Palestinian issue dominates international news coverage of Israel, with images of missiles, terror tunnels and failed peace negotiations frequently splashed across TV screens and newspapers. So you would think that security would be the central issue in Tuesday\u2019s Israeli elections, right? The short answer is no. Poll after poll in Israel has confirmed that the public views the high cost of living as the top issue for voters in this election. Indeed, even a majority of Israel\u2019s Arab citizens within the pre-1967 borders \u2013 most of whom identify with the Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza \u2013 view socioeconomic issues as the priority for Tuesday\u2019s parliamentary poll, rather than advancing the Israeli-Palestinian peace process. What explains this apparent indifference? First, despite what the polls suggest, peace and security actually remain the most important underlying issue in Israeli politics. The main parties recognize that they need to cross the credibility threshold on this issue, and they therefore include former high-ranking army officers and diplomats among their ranks. Whatever they may say to pollsters, many voters continue to vote primarily on this issue. However, because most such voters are staunch supporters of the right or the left and have already made up their minds, they are unlikely to shift their vote between these two blocs, so their votes are not in play in these elections. This wasn\u2019t always the case \u2013 a significant group of voters once swung back and forth between right and left. However, for some time now, the majority of Israelis have shared a consensual position on the Palestinian question. In principle, they continue to favor a two-state solution and they are prepared to make extensive compromises in exchange for genuine peace \u2013 greater concessions than in the 1990s at the height of the peace process. However, in practice, that same majority believes that even if an Israeli government were to agree to more compromises than they view as acceptable, Israel would still not obtain the minimum required in terms of peace and security to make the deal worthwhile. Why? Experience has certainly taught middle Israel to be deeply skeptical of the possibility of peace with the Palestinians, irrespective of the complexion of the Israeli government. In 2000, for example, a Labor-led government agreed to a Palestinian state in all of Gaza, 97% of the West Bank and Arab East Jerusalem, including the holiest site in Judaism, the Temple Mount. Yet not only did Yasser Arafat reject the deal, but the Palestinians launched an unprecedented wave of suicide bombings against Israeli civilians. Add in the fact that subsequent unilateral Israeli withdrawals from south Lebanon and Gaza resulted in tens of thousands of rockets being launched at Israeli civilians, and the 2008 decision by Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas to reject Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Olmert\u2019s peace proposal \u2013 a plan similar to the Clinton parameters that Arafat rejected in 2000 \u2013 and Israeli wariness is easy to understand. Israel votes Since then, leaks from the recent round of peace talks have only served to strengthen the Israeli public\u2019s skepticism \u2013 the Likud leader Benjamin Netanyahu was reportedly prepared to accept a Palestinian state based on the 1967 borders, only for Abbas to refuse to engage positively with a wide-ranging American peace outline including this element, according to Israel\u2019s Channel 2, even when he was presented with it directly by President Obama himself. As a result of all this, much of the electorate is determining its vote based on other issues, where voters hope political change in Israel can actually make a real difference to their lives. Indeed, the most likely candidate for kingmaker following the elections is Moshe Kahlon\u2019s centrist party Kulanu, whose agenda is to lower the cost of living in Israel. (Kahlon won fame in Israel by dramatically lowering the cost of cell phone use through the introduction of wide-ranging competition into the market.) In keeping with the mood of the public, the ex-Likudnik presents a moderate image on the Palestinian issue and has appeared to try to steer away from discussing issues of peace and security. In fact, one senior Israeli official told me that Kahlon\u2019s team has been advised against even mentioning the word \u201cpeace\u201d for the rest of the campaign. That says it all.

            "article_content": "NEW: Demonstrators attend Chicago Police Board meeting, angrily address board about concerns Protesters flood Chicago streets after Mayor Rahm Emanuel speaks at special City Council session Emanuel pushes for a renewed focus on community policing, building relationships Hundreds of protesters spilled into the streets near Chicago\u2019s City Hall moments after Mayor Rahm Emanuel said the city needs \u201ca painful and honest reckoning into what went wrong\u201d in instances in which police officers used excessive force. During a special City Council meeting he convened Wednesday, Emanuel said he was sorry about the circumstances surrounding the death of Laquan McDonald, including the fact it took 13 months before police dashboard camera video of McDonald\u2019s shooting became public and the officer who killed him was charged. \u201cI own it,\u201d the mayor said. \u201cI take responsibility for what happened, because it happened on my watch. \u201cAnd if we\u2019re going to fix it, I want you to understand that it\u2019s my responsibility.\u201d Emanuel\u2019s speech on Wednesday, however, was not just about what happened the night of October 20, 2014, when Chicago police Officer Jason Van Dyke killed McDonald. The city resisted releasing dashcam video showing the shooting until late last month, then did so the same day Van Dyke was charged with murder. Emanuel also talked more broadly about a \u201clack of mutual respect\u201d between some Chicagoans and police. Some believe officers treat them differently and make unfounded assumptions because of how they look or where they live, according to the mayor, a perception that feeds their anger and despair. Demonstrators, who called for Emanuel to step down, confronted a line of police before the officers stepped aside and let them through as they flooded the streets. Sometimes the protesters were walking down Michigan Avenue, but they also would stop and sit down in the road. Some people have had an impression that police put protecting their own ahead of protecting all citizens, which critics say was illustrated by how other police officers\u2019 accounts of McDonald\u2019s death were at odds with what dashcam video showed. Emanuel referred to a \u201ccode of silence.\u201d Putting it succinctly, the mayor said, \u201cWe have a trust problem.\u201d One protester called for police to release all videos in controversial cases in which citizens have died in incidents with police officers. Another told CNN the angst between Chicago residents and police is not new. A woman who identified herself as Magda said: \u201cWe cannot allow this (lack of justice) to continue.\u201d \u201cHistorically Chicago does not have a good name with the treatment of the people, treatment of citizens. And I\u2019m really proud of the young people that are here today because they\u2019re standing up,\u201d she added. Many of the protesters appeared to be in their early 20s. Many of them were shouting, \u201cRahm, resign!\u201d They also called for Cook County State\u2019s Attorney Anita Alvarez to step down. PHOTOS: Protesters march north on Michigan Avenue: https://t.co/tQj1OeCqpS pic.twitter.com/5y3mwSkOMe Protesters began on Michigan Avenue then hooked onto other streets. When they went by the famed Tavern on Rush, the wait staff peered out windows giving thumbs up and snapping photographs. Marcher Jay Payne, a 41-year-old paralegal with a civil rights law firm, said Emanuel and Alvarez need to resign because they\u2019ve lost the support of the community. \u201cThey\u2019re protecting criminal cops,\u201d he said. At one point a woman shouted through a megaphone, \u201cShow me what democracy looks like.\u201d She kept reinforcing to the crowd that this would be a peaceful protest. Police officers walked behind and beside demonstrators as they proceeded through the streets. The protests broke up around sunset, then resumed at a meeting of the Chicago Police Board. CNN affiliate WLS reported dozens of protesters angrily spoke during the meeting. More than 100 demonstrators gathered outside police headquarters. The mayor had a lot of recent history to work with ahead of Wednesday\u2019s speech \u2013 little of it good. The most high-profile case relates to McDonald. The 13-month gap from the incident until the charge and video release was too long for some, who accused police and Emanuel of a cover-up. It contributed to Garry McCarthy losing his job as Chicago\u2019s police superintendent and spurred calls for Emanuel to resign. The furor grew when the public learned about the other officers\u2019 accounts. There\u2019s also Ronald Johnson, killed by police eight days before McDonald. On Monday, reporters first saw video of his death, with Alvarez saying the officer who killed Johnson won\u2019t face charges. Questions surround another Chicago police shooting There also has been renewed focus on 17-year-old Cedrick LaMont Chatman, whose 2013 death near a bus stop was captured by four video cameras. The Chicago agency that investigates all police-involved shootings, the Independent Police Review Authority, deemed that shooting justified. But Lorenzo Davis, IPRA\u2019s original supervising investigator on the case, didn\u2019t agree. Davis said he was fired in July when he refused to change his report. On Wednesday, Emanuel said IPRA will take a fresh look at the circumstances surrounding Johnson\u2019s and Chatman\u2019s final moments. He was even more definitive and emphatic talking about McDonald\u2019s death, which he called \u201ctotally avoidable.\u201d But fixing this isn\u2019t simply a matter of prosecuting Van Dyke or giving McDonald\u2019s family money (the Chicago City Council approved a $5 million settlement in April). The mayor outlined steps that have been taken so far or are in the works, like police\u2019s increased use of body cameras, reshaping the leadership and approach of IPRA, and a renewed focus on community policing. More than anything, according to Emanuel, there needs to be a culture change in how police see and deal with citizens, and vice versa. \u201cIt is one thing to train officers on fighting crime,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is a whole other thing to build friendships and relationships, which are integral to fighting crime.\u201d As he\u2019s done before, Emanuel noted Wednesday that most Chicago police officers, day in and day out, do a good job. And it\u2019s a very difficult one, given the dangers in parts of the city \u2013 a fact that not all citizens grasp, according to the mayor. Chicago began being called the murder capital of the United States in 2012, after it registered 503 homicides, more than any other city. The FBI\u2019s 2014 statistics showed 411 killings, more than the 333 in New York and 260 in Los Angeles, two cities with larger populations. DOJ investigating Chicago Police Department Emanuel lamented Wednesday that young people join gangs \u201cin search of self-worth\u201d and because they don\u2019t see hope for a better life, saying, \u201cWe as a city must and can do better.\u201d This includes tackling issues related to poverty, opportunity and family, as well as law enforcement\u2019s relationship with its citizens, he said. Emanuel said Chicago needs help and welcomed a U.S. Justice Department investigation into its police department, announced on Monday. The federal \u201cpattern-and-practice\u201d investigation, as it is called, will look into whether city officers have made a habit of violating the law or the Constitution while on the beat, according to Attorney General Loretta Lynch. \u201cWe will be a better city for it,\u201d the mayor said Wednesday. \u201cIt is in our self-interest, because we need (federal) assistance to make the fundamental and necessary changes.\u201d A Chicago-based state legislator, citing the public\u2019s lack of confidence in Emanuel filed a bill that would allow for a recall election of the mayor. Rep. La Shawn Ford told CNN affiliate WBBM, \u201cUntil he can regain confidence, we have to have something in place that we can try to bring the city together.\u201d Rep. Mary E. Flowers is a co-sponsor to the bill. The house next meets on January 13.

            "article_content": "Prosecutor Marilyn Mosby files criminal charges against six officers Mosby has only been on the job since January \"I think that she will follow where the evidence leads. I do not think she will follow just public opinion,\" says a supporter Shortly after being elected nearly two years ago, Baltimore State\u2019s Attorney Marilyn Mosby said prosecutors in her troubled city had the \u201ctoughest job in America.\u201d Mosby, who took over her first elected post in January, responded forcefully Friday to the toughest case of her nascent career. She announced charges ranging from second-degree depraved-heart murder, to manslaughter, to second-degree assault, against six officers in connection with the death of Freddie Gray. The unexpected announcement was greeted with cheers and applause from spectators at Mosby\u2019s outdoor news conference. On the streets, motorists honked their horns in approval. Twitter was abuzz with word of the decision. The U.S. just got quite an introduction to Baltimore State's Attny Marilyn Mosby. Forceful speech announcing #FreddyGray charges met w/cheer Mosby urged the public to remain calm. \u201cTo the people of Baltimore and demonstrators across America, I heard your call for \u2018No Justice, No peace,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cYour peace is sincerely needed as I work to deliver justice on behalf of this young man.\u201d Gray, 25, died in police custody April 19 from a fatal spinal cord injury, one week after he was arrested. Baltimore protests Mosby, 35, who comes from a long line of police officers, including her grandfather, four uncles and her mother, assumes a key role in the latest case to draw national attention to the issue of relations between police officers and the communities they are sworn to serve. \u201cTo the rank-and-file officers of the Baltimore City Police Department, please know that the accusations of these six officers are not an indictment on the entire force,\u201d she said at the time. She reiterated that sentiment during Wednesday\u2019s remarks. Mosby noted that her grandfather, who died recently, was a founding member of the first African-American police organization in Massachusetts. \u201cFor those that believe that I\u2019m anti-police, it\u2019s simply not the case. I\u2019m anti-police brutality. And I need not remind you that the only loss \u2013 and the greatest loss \u2013 in all of this was that of Freddie Gray\u2019s life,\u201d Mosby told reporters Wednesday. Gray died at hospital April 19, 2015, from a fatal spinal cord injury, one week after he was taken into custody. Prosecutors argued the 25-year-old suffered the injury while being transported \u201chandcuffed, shackled by his feet and unrestrained\u201d inside a police van. It is against police policy to transport a prisoner without proper restraints such as a seat belt. A 10 p.m. citywide curfew was put into effect days ago, and National Guard troops have joined Baltimore police in an attempt to maintain order. On Thursday, as police handed their investigative files over to the state attorney\u2019s officer a day earlier than planned, supporters of the former insurance company lawyer expressed confidence in Mosby\u2019s ability to handle the volatile case. What we know, don\u2019t know about Freddie Gray\u2019s arrest \u201cWe\u2019re enthusiastic about the new prosecutor,\u201d said William \u201cBilly\u201d Murphy Jr., a former Baltimore judge who is lead attorney for Gray\u2019s family. \u201cShe comes to the office with a belief in the integrity of these kinds of investigations. We have much more confidence in her than we have in the police because there\u2019s never been any level of confidence, nor should there be, in the police investigating themselves.\u201d Mosby said that while police have regularly briefed her office on their findings, her team has been conducting its own independent probe into the death. 45 CVS workers still getting paid after riots shut down stores \u201cWe ask for the public to remain patient and peaceful and to trust the process of the justice system,\u201d she said. Mosby is married to Baltimore City Councilman Nick Mosby, who represents areas of West Baltimore where riots erupted in April 2015. The Mosbys have two young daughters. \u201cShe\u2019s a strong woman,\u201d Nick Mosby told CNN at the time. \u201cShe was built for this. \u2026 I was at church service the other day and they were talking about being at the right place with the right person at the right time. I know her heart has always been convicted to ensure that justice will be served fairly and equally across the board.\u201d During her campaign against Gregg Bernstein in 2014, Mosby spoke about the broad-daylight shooting death of her 17-year-old cousin on her front doorstep. \u201cI learned very early on that the criminal justice system isn\u2019t just the police, the judges and the state\u2019s attorney,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s much more than that. I believe that we are the justice system. We, the members of the community, are the justice system because we are the victims of crimes.\u201d Mosby said her cousin\u2019s 1994 murder was her introduction to the criminal justice system. \u201cHaving to go to court and deal with prosecutors,\u201d she said. \u201cHaving to go to court and see my neighbor who had the courage and audacity to cooperate with the police \u2026 to testify in court and the way the district attorney\u2019s office treated my family is something that inspired me.\u201d Mosby, who grew up in Boston, is the youngest chief prosecutor of any major American city, according to the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s website. At age 6, Mosby was accepted into a school desegregation program in Massachusetts. She later participated in a study of the civil rights movement. \u201cAfter having that awesome experience I knew I wanted to be an attorney,\u201d she said during her campaign. A. Dwight Pettit, a civil rights attorney and Mosby supporter, said at the time charges were filed against the six officers that he felt Mosby would \u201cdeliver on doing it right, and getting it right. I\u2019m confident in that.\u201d \u201cShe\u2019s very dedicated and part of what she campaigned on was bringing integrity to the office, and so I believe that she will move in a methodical way,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I think that she will follow where the evidence leads. I do not think she will follow just public opinion.\u201d When she was sworn in as chief prosecutor in January 2015, Mosby brought up the lack of trust between the community and police. \u201cOur time to repair that trust, to come together collectively as a community to start to break down the barriers to progress in our communities is now,\u201d she said. Mosby added, \u201cAs a black woman who understands just how much the criminal justice system disproportionately affects communities of color, I will seek justice on your behalf.\u201d Mosby is African-American, as are Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake and other leading Baltimore officials. About 63% of Baltimore\u2019s population is black, but the city faces stunning disparities between black and white residents when it comes to income, employment, poverty, housing, incarceration and overall health. The people on Mosby\u2019s transition team included former Mayor Kurt Schmoke, former congressman and NAACP president Kweisi Mfume, and Murphy, who represents Gray\u2019s family. Murphy last year donated a total of $5,000 to Mosby\u2019s campaign, according to Maryland campaign reporting records. Schmoke, a former state\u2019s attorney and Baltimore\u2019s first African-American mayor, said Mosby\u2019s background will buy her time with a tense community anxious for justice. \u201cI actually think that the level of patience will actually increase primarily because the state\u2019s attorney, Marilyn Mosby, was recently elected,\u201d he said. \u201cShe has a level of credibility with the community that will allow for that patience.\u201d Mosby defeated Gregg Bernstein as state\u2019s attorney in a 2014 election. \u201cBaltimore prosecutors get to see it all in court \u2013 we\u2019ve got the toughest job in America,\u201d she said in a statement after the election. Mary Koch, another attorney for Gray\u2019s family, said the new chief prosecutor has her work cut out for her. \u201cThe family wants the truth and they want it to be arrived at very carefully and that\u2019s not going to be an easy job for Ms. Mosby,\u201d said Koch, adding: \u201cThat\u2019s her job. That\u2019s the job she took on.\u201d Complete coverage",

            "article_content": "Hillary Clinton stresses her own key role in nudging the former generals in charge of Myanmar Experts say Clinton's role was important, but local and geopolitical factors had larger effect Hillary Clinton is claiming a share of the credit after elections in Myanmar delivered a landslide win for the democratic opposition. The results from Sunday\u2019s vote came after a political opening that Clinton helped nurture and that forms a central part of her legacy as secretary of state. The Democratic front-runner released a statement that was careful to note remaining obstacles to full democracy in the Southeast Asian nation and to share credit with her old boss, President Barack Obama. But she also stressed her own key role in nudging the former generals in charge of Myanmar, also known as Burma, toward reform, hinting at the importance of the election to her own political prospects, given that her time as the top U.S. diplomat lacks a long list of clear diplomatic triumphs. Clinton is likely to use the election in Myanmar to fend off claims by Republicans \u2013 who universally targeted her at their latest campaign debate on Tuesday night \u2013 that her tenure as secretary of state was an unmitigated disaster, following reversals on the \u201creset\u201d of relations with Russia that she managed and the Western intervention in Libya. Landmark elections in Myanmar READ: Myanmar election: Suu Kyi to meet with President \u201cThe Burmese election on Sunday was an important, though imperfect, step forward in the country\u2019s long journey toward democracy,\u201d Clinton said in a statement issued on Wednesday night. \u201cIt was also an affirmation of the indispensable role the United States can and should play in the world as a champion of peace and progress.\u201d Though final results are not yet in, the election delivered a huge victory for Aung San Suu Kyi\u2019s National League for Democracy and a defeat for the military establishment that has ruled the country for decades. Though Suu Kyi is prevented by the constitution from becoming president, she has indicated she will nominate a figurehead from her party for the post and she experts to effectively rule the country as the power behind the throne. Clinton stressed that one election does not a democracy make and that the country has a long road ahead on national reconciliation and constitutional reform. But she said promoting political change in a nation like Myanmar was exactly the kind of goal that U.S. foreign policy should pursue \u2013 arguing for not just her record but her approach to geopolitics. \u201cWhen I was Secretary of State, President Obama and I worked with Aung San Suu Kyi and others on the ground in Burma to nurture flickers of progress into a real opening,\u201d Clinton said, praising the Burmese people for their determination. \u201cAs President, I will ensure that the United States continues to stand with them and with everyone around the world who seeks liberty and dignity.\u201d The Myanmar election also represents a gain for Obama\u2019s policy of rebalancing U.S. foreign policy toward Asia and his signature strategy of being willing to talk to American foes \u2013 like Myanmar\u2019s military leaders \u2013 as he prepares for a trip to Asia next week. Photos: Suu Kyi through the years Obama spoke to Myanmar President Thein Sein on Wednesday night to commend the government on its role in running the election. The White House said the leaders agreed that the formation of a new government would be an \u201cimportant step forward in Burma\u2019s democratic transition.\u201d Obama also spoke to Suu Kyi to congratulate her on the NLD\u2019s success after years of persecution, which included her own long periods of house arrest. \u201cThe President commended her for her tireless efforts and sacrifice over so many years to promote a more inclusive, peaceful, and democratic Burma,\u201d a second White House statement said. Clinton devoted an entire chapter in her memoir \u201cHard Choices\u201d to Myanmar, presenting herself as the decisive driver of the U.S. effort to bring the country in from the cold and toward the \u201ctantalizing\u201d prospect of democracy. \u201cI had my eyes open about the risks, but when I weighed up all the factors, I didn\u2019t see how we could pass up this opportunity,\u201d Clinton wrote, saying she was keen to prod the generals running the country to move toward political reform but wary of embracing them too fast. And it is indisputable that Myanmar has come a long way since Washington spotted a chance to push the reform process in 2009. For decades before the political thaw, it was a grim, Orwellian place, stifled by an insidious national security apparatus and isolated from the world by a paranoid military junta that used poverty and repression as instruments of power. But the blossoming of economic and political freedoms changed life in a ramshackle nation where even Internet and mobile phones are a recent luxury. Hundreds of political dissidents were freed from hellish military prisons and Suu Kyi \u2013 after years under house arrest \u2013 is now a member of parliament. READ: On the road: Myanmar The United States, meanwhile, has lifted many of its sanctions on the Myanmar government and sent an ambassador back to the country. In late 2011, Clinton was the first U.S. secretary of state to visit Burma since the military clamped down in 1962. Critics, however, point to the military\u2019s engineering of the electoral system to weight it in its favor and say that shows the reform process in Myanmar is not as clear a triumph as Clinton might like to portray it. Though the army has withdrawn from front-line politics and Sein Thein has taken off his uniform, Myanmar\u2019s constitution still guarantees the military the right to appoint lawmakers to 25% of seats in parliament, whatever the result of the election. Some critics also believe that Obama\u2019s visit to Myanmar in 2012 \u2013 on a trip that triggered extraordinary scenes of Burmese on the streets mobbing his motorcade \u2013 was too soon. Meanwhile, continued violence against the persecuted Muslim Rohingya minority and multiple civil wars that have raged since the country\u2019s independence from Britain in 1948 also undermine the idea that Burma is a success story. Clinton seems to have anticipated many of the problems and noted in her book that when she left office, Myanmar\u2019s fate still hung in the balance. \u201cBurma could keep moving forward, or it could slide backward,\u201d Clinton wrote. There\u2019s also the complication of just how big a share Clinton should get of whatever credit there is to claim. Clinton: Flickers of progress in Myanmar \u201cThe policy of engagement that the Obama administration adopted was helpful,\u201d said Lex Rieffel, a Brookings Institution economist who has studied Myanmar and visited many times. \u201cIt did more good than harm as opposed to the sanctions policy. (But) let\u2019s not attribute the changes in that country to U.S. policy.\u201d In her book, Clinton writes that she spotted an opportunity in early trips to Asia to work on Myanmar, especially after Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono told her during her first visit to Asia as secretary of state in February 2009 that the generals might be interested in a dialogue with the United States. She also coordinated closely with Suu Kyi. But while Clinton did play an important role in mentoring the process, the primary motive for Myanmar\u2019s opening appears to have been rooted in local and geopolitical factors. \u201cBurma\u2019s opening was mainly a process driven by Burmese leaders, rather than the U.S., as they sought to create strategic space against China and generate economic growth through greater exposure to the world,\u201d said Daniel Twining, an Asia expert who worked in the State Department during the Bush administration. There was clearly an impulse from within the Myanmar government to shake free of self-imposed isolation. The country\u2019s poverty and lack of access to outside capital because of U.S. and European sanctions contrasted sharply with economic development in a region where states like Thailand and Indonesia were roaring ahead. U.S. officials have privately shared stories about how the gulf between Myanmar and its fast-rising Southeast Asian neighbors was brought home at regional summits when ministers from Myanmar marveled at innovations like iPhones sported by their counterparts in other countries. Such nuanced verdicts, like the one on Myanmar, often have a tendency to get exaggerated on the campaign trail, and any attempt by Clinton\u2019s supporters to paint her Myanmar policy as a Nixon-to-China moment would be overblown. But if the successful election translates into an enduring milestone on Myanmar\u2019s rocky road to eventual democracy, she would be justified in claiming an important role in an unlikely political transformation.",

            "article_content": "The parliamentary election in Myanmar is the most significant step yet in its journey from junta rule toward democracy Clinton presents herself as the decisive driver of the U.S. effort to bring Myanmar in from the cold The foreign policy legacy anchoring Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign will be on the ballot for the first time on Sunday \u2013 8,000 miles away. The parliamentary election in impoverished Myanmar is the most significant step yet in the Southeast Asian nation\u2019s halting journey from junta rule toward democracy, a process Clinton claims as one of her top achievements as secretary of state. That the future of the chronically underdeveloped country, also known as Burma, is so important to the Democratic front-runner is a reminder that Clinton\u2019s record as the top U.S. diplomat in a period of intractable crises is not exactly bristling with foreign policy wins. And if events there do represent a victory, it is hardly a clear-cut one. Myanmar human rights record questioned Clinton is in a particularly perilous position because her fate is not in her own hands: She can no longer shape events \u2013 like the situation in Myanmar \u2013 on which her legacy depends and on which she will be judged in the heat of a presidential campaign. Indeed, opponents like Republican Marco Rubio are already highlighting vulnerabilities in her tenure, pointing to chaos stirred by the U.S.-led operation in Libya and a busted \u201creset\u201d of relations with Russia \u2013 both of which she championed. In Myanmar, it is clear that the governing system produced by the political opening that Clinton and President Barack Obama pushed is far from perfect. In fact, the structure of government remains rigged in favor of the military, which ruled the country for decades with an iron fist. Clinton devotes an entire chapter in her memoir \u201cHard Choices\u201d to Myanmar and the deep kinship she feels with another pioneering female leader, opposition icon and Nobel peace laureate Aung San Suu Kyi, head of the opposition National League for Democracy Party, called the NLD. Clinton presents herself as the decisive driver of the U.S. effort to bring Myanmar in from the cold and toward the \u201ctantalizing\u201d prospect of democracy. \u201cI had my eyes open about the risks, but when I weighed up all the factors, I didn\u2019t see how we could pass up this opportunity,\u201d Clinton wrote, saying she was keen to prod the generals running the country to move toward political reform but wary of embracing them too fast. The political evolution of Myanmar is so central to Clinton\u2019s legacy that she raised it at one of the most stressful moments of her presidential campaign \u2013 a Capitol Hill hearing on Benghazi last month \u2013 to prove her ability to bridge political divides in Washington. \u201cI worked with Republican Leader Sen. Mitch McConnell to open up Burma, now Myanmar, to find democratic change,\u201d Clinton said in her opening statement. Myanmar prepares for historic election But claiming an accomplishment in the volatile country is also fraught with risk. \u201cClinton needs to be careful about taking too much credit, not simply because the process was not made in America, but also because it is not complete,\u201d said Daniel Twining, a former State Department official in the last Bush administration. Still, by any measure Myanmar has come a long way. For decades before the political thaw, it was a grim, Orwellian place, stifled by an insidious national security apparatus and isolated from the world by a paranoid military junta that used poverty and repression as instruments of power. But the blossoming of economic and political freedoms changed life in a ramshackle nation where even Internet and mobile phones are a recent luxury. Hundreds of political dissidents were freed from hellish military prisons and Aung San Suu Kyi \u2013 after years under house arrest \u2013 is now a member of parliament. While there are fears the junta will sway results or cause irregularities in voting, millions of Burmese are getting the chance to vote and the media is freer than it once was. Such an outcome would have been unthinkable eight years ago. The United States, meanwhile, has lifted many of its sanctions on the Myanmar government and sent an ambassador back to the country. In late 2011, Clinton was the first secretary of state to visit Burma since the military clamped down in 1962. So Clinton\u2019s claims do have some credibility. Critics, however, point to the military\u2019s engineering of the electoral system to weight it in its favor to counter claims that the reform process in Myanmar is as clear a triumph as Clinton might like to portray it. \u201cThe most likely outcome of the Myanmar elections is a government that remains guided by current and former generals, despite what will be a strong showing for the NLD, and one from which Aung San Suu Kyi is excluded from executive power,\u201d according to Twining. Though the army has withdrawn from front-line politics, and President Thein Sein has taken off his uniform, Myanmar\u2019s constitution still guarantees the military 25% of seats in parliament, whatever the result of the election. Together with the seats of the Union Solidarity and Development Party, made up of former generals, that allows the military to maintain its controlling influence on government. Even if her NLD wins, Aung San Suu Kyi will not become president. The military, with her in mind, inserted a clause in the constitution barring anyone whose spouse or children are foreigners from serving as president. Suu Kyi\u2019s late husband and two sons are British. Some close observers of Myanmar say the Obama administration must share the blame for the problems on the path to democracy. \u201cBurma is not a success story. If the administration wants Burma to be a success story, then they have got to apply greater leverage than they have on the Burmese regime to change,\u201d said Simon Billenness, executive director of the U.S. Campaign for Burma, a nongovernmental organization that campaigns for democracy and human rights in the country. \u201cWhen the Burmese regime started to open up, they did take advantage of that,\u201d he said. \u201cBut they dropped sanctions too soon and gave up their leverage.\u201d Some critics also believe that Obama visited Myanmar \u2013 a trip that triggered extraordinary scenes of Burmese on the streets mobbing his motorcade \u2013 too soon. Clinton: Flickers of progress in Myanmar His six-hour stay in November 2012 had the feel of a victory lap, not least because it was the last trip Clinton made with the president on Air Force One and highlighted the administration\u2019s claim that the Myanmar opening was a vindication of its Asia pivot strategy and also of Obama\u2019s signature policy of engaging U.S. enemies. If the NLD does rack up a big win as expected \u2013 though the primitive state of polling in Myanmar means no one is sure how Sunday\u2019s vote will turn out \u2013 that could be seen as a vindication of Clinton\u2019s approach, despite the caveats. Ben Rhodes, a deputy national security adviser who played an important role in the development of U.S. policy toward Myanmar, said the country is still a work in progress but said the changes in the country have validated the administration\u2019s approach. \u201cIt is a mixed picture, Rhodes said, but added that the opening was \u201cwell, well worth (doing)\u201d and pointed out that \u201cthe story doesn\u2019t end on November 8.\u201d But there\u2019s also uncertainty, since in 1990 the military reacted to an overwhelming NLD election victory by simply ignoring the result, ushering in a period of crackdowns on the democracy movement and house arrest for Suu Kyi. Meanwhile, continued violence against the persecuted Muslim Rohingya minority and multiple civil wars that have raged since the country\u2019s independence from Britain in 1948 also undermine the idea that Burma is a success story. Clinton seems to have anticipated many of the problems \u2013 and in her book, says that when she left office, Myanmar\u2019s fate still hung in the balance. \u201cBurma could keep moving forward, or it could slide backward,\u201d Clinton wrote. That assessment was backed by McConnell, a frequent Clinton critic, who has worked on Myanmar policy for years and said the country still faces significant challenges. \u201cAt the same time, we should not allow these things to completely overshadow what Burma has accomplished. It\u2019s come a long way in recent years. There are many positive things to be built upon as well,\u201d McConnell said on the Senate floor last month. There\u2019s also the complication of just how big a share Clinton should get of whatever credit there is to claim. \u201cThe policy of engagement that the Obama administration adopted was helpful,\u201d said Lex Rieffel, a Brookings Institution economist who has studied Myanmar and visited many times. \u201cIt did more good than harm as opposed to the sanctions policy.

            "article_content": "Haley suggested her experience as an Indian-American woman uniquely positions her to lead her state past its difficulties with race But she has not always embraced removing the Confederate flag South Carolina Republican Gov. Nikki Haley stared down hate and history this summer, turning an impassioned debate over the Confederate flag into a political launching pad. Other state figures had faltered when confronting the legacy of the Confederate flag and pushing for its removal. But Haley\u2019s quick call for it to be taken off the capitol grounds in the wake of the Charleston church shooting \u2013 a call that culminated in Friday\u2019s ceremony in which hundreds of locals cheered its relocation to a museum \u2013 has allowed her to bask in glowing reviews. \u201cNow there\u2019s more reason to come to this state,\u201d Haley said in an interview with CNN\u2019s Don Lemon. \u201cI am proud to say that it\u2019s a new day in South Carolina.\u201d And also a new day for Governor Haley. \u201cShe saw an opportunity and saw a spotlight on South Carolina and saw that there were going to be real significant problems for the state and the Republicans if they couldn\u2019t bring it down,\u201d said Katie Packer Gage, a Republican consultant. \u201cShe stepped up and it didn\u2019t take her weeks or months, even though she could have punted. She is a smart politician.\u201d Haley: Confederate flag \u2018should never have been there\u2019 The once-rising star, whose shine had faded after her 2010 gubernatorial victory, has emerged from the flag battle as the face of the \u201cnew South.\u201d By leading the efforts to take down a flag embraced by alleged killer Dylann Roof, Haley helped her party and her own profile. Even Democrats offered praise. \u201cHad it not been for the governor saying she was supportive of this, I don\u2019t think we would have been at the ceremony we were at today,\u201d said Jaime Harrison, who chairs the state\u2019s Democratic Party. \u201cI know people say it was political, but she did what was right and for that I can\u2019t be mad at her. I\u2019m very appreciative of her.\u201d Harrison was one of the handful of leaders Haley met with in the hours before she announced days after the shooting in June that she wanted the flag to come down. He was expecting yet another compromise, but Haley had made up her mind. In her interview with Lemon, Haley said Friday that \u201cthe biggest reason I asked for that flag to come down was I couldn\u2019t look my children in the face and justify it staying there.\u201d She also said that the flag should never have been displayed prominently on Capitol grounds. \u201cThese grounds are a place that everybody should feel a part of,\u201d she said. \u201cWhat I realized now more than ever is people were driving by and felt hurt and pain. No one should feel pain.\u201d She suggested that her experience as a path-breaking Indian-American woman uniquely positions her to lead her state past its difficulties with race and exclusion. Haley recounted the day when her father wanted to buy produce at a fruit stand and two police officers were called to keep their eyes on him. The officers stood at the register until Haley\u2019s father made his purchase. \u201cI remember how bad that felt. And my dad went to the register, shook their hands, said \u2018thank you,\u2019 paid for his things and not a word was said going home. I knew what had just happened,\u201d Haley said. \u201cThat produce stand is still there and every time I drive by it, I still feel that pain. I realized that that Confederate flag was the same pain that so many people were feeling.\u201d In the past, Haley has often told the story of growing up in Bamberg, South Carolina, and not qualifying to be the black or white Homecoming queen because of her ethnic background, making her the best example of the state\u2019s new South image. But she has not always embraced removing the Confederate flag, a controversial idea that has tripped up many national and state politicians. Flags and tags: New battles loom over Confederate symbols In October of 2014, when her Democratic opponent for governor, state Sen. Vincent Sheheen, said the flag should be taken down to repair the state\u2019s image, Haley rebuffed the idea even as the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and the National Collegiate Athletic Association boycotted the state. Remembering Sen. Clementa Pinckney \u201cWhat I can tell you is over the last three and a half years, I spent a lot of my days on the phones with CEOs and recruiting jobs to this state,\u201d she said during an October 2014 debate. \u201cI can honestly say I have not had one conversation with a single CEO about the Confederate flag.\u201d One of her predecessors, Republican Gov. David Beasley, proposed moving the flag from the Captiol dome, but that was rejected by state lawmakers in 1997. He subsequently lost his reelection bid. In 2000 state lawmakers reached a compromise, moving the flag near a Civil War memorial and adding a monument to African-Americans on the statehouse grounds. But even with that compromise, the flag remained a wedge issue. Mitt Romney faced a barrage of attacks when he came out against the flag in 2008 and 2012. Newt Gingrich ran to Romney\u2019s right, embracing a state\u2019s rights argument in defense of the flag. Gingrich went on to win the state\u2019s primary. But, in some of her most high-profile speeches, Haley has insisted that South Carolina is the state that has changed the most in the last 50 years. And that her election and that of Sen. Tim Scott, an African-American Republican, has been the proof. And like South Carolina, Haley has changed. She was lauded by Sarah Palin in her 2010 run and her come-from-behind victory landed her on the cover of Newsweek. But her national profile didn\u2019t win her any new friends in the state legislature, where she took on powerful members of her party as a member of the House before she became governor. Once seen as an outsider and a tea party upstart, with approval ratings in the 30s, her relentless focus on jobs has allowed her to promote herself with the business wing of the GOP. \u201cShe very very successfully branded herself as the jobs governor,\u201d said Scott Huffmon, a political science professor at Winthrop University. \u201cBut she kept her conservative credentials by railing against Obamacare and toeing the line on things that conservatives care about. She has been able to keep a foot in both worlds for a while. And now she is breaking away from being simply a Southern to becoming a national Republican.\u201d She has also added to her portfolio. Last month she signed a bill requiring law enforcement to wear body cameras, a move she touted as an example of her state being in the vanguard on a national issue. Though she has been at odds with the Republican-dominated state legislature, frequently calling them out in speeches and on her Facebook page for their failure to back her agenda on a transportation bill and on ethics reform, she enjoys high marks among Republicans. She won reelection in a landslide and a Winthrop University poll from April showed her with 79% approval rating among likely South Carolina Republicans primary voters. Packer Gage said her soaring ratings and new prominence, which coincides with the beginning of the 2016 presidential race, might open up opportunities for her at the White House. \u201cShe would make a strong vice presidential candidate, and the fact that she is a woman is icing on the cake,\u201d Packer Gage said. \u201cBut maybe she should run for president.\u201d Yet given how contentious the flag debate has been, her popularity could fall in the state even as her national profile rises. \u201cThe glow of this will dissipate. The question is, are you building a record of moving people forward and taking people from poverty to the working middle class?\u201d Harrison, a Democrat, said. \u201cYou can\u2019t just hang your hat on one good deed.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Ben Carson wants to convince voters that a doctor is best positioned to fix what\u2019s ailing America. \u201cI\u2019m Ben Carson, and I\u2019m a candidate for president of the United States,\u201d he told a crowd in his hometown of Detroit on Monday, making his presidential bid official to wild applause. In a speech to a crowd that his campaign estimated at thousands, the retired neurosurgeon and unlikely conservative star introduced his wife and family and called for \u201cthe people to rise up and take the government back.\u201d Carson told the story of his rise from poverty, where he lived in homes infested with roaches \u2014\u00a0\u201cin the more upscale areas, they called \u2018em waterbugs, but we knew what they were\u201d he joked \u2014 and promised that he wouldn\u2019t change his signature style, framing himself as an outsider up against the political elite. \u201cI\u2019m probably never going to be politically correct because I\u2019m not a politician,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be a politician. Because politicians do what is politically expedient \u2014\u00a0I want to do what\u2019s right.\u201d Carson\u2019s theatrical announcement event included a gospel choir singing a medley topped by Eminem\u2019s \u201cLose Yourself,\u201d but the celebratory tone of the day was shrouded in private sadness for the candidate. His campaign confirmed earlier Monday that Carson\u2019s ailing mother was growing progressively sicker, and he planned to delay his planned trip to Iowa to head to Dallas on Monday to say goodbye. But the notoriously sharp-tongued orator maintained his calm demeanor on stage Monday, taking sharp jabs at everything from the media to the Obama administration\u2019s policies. He called for an end to social programs that \u201ccreate dependency,\u201d and, signaling he may seek to play in Capitol Hill battles, telling supporters that if their lawmaker voted to raise the debt limit, \u201cyou need to throw them out of office.\u201d Carson demanded another \u201cwave election\u201d this cycle, not of Republicans (who already control both chambers of Congress), but rather to elect \u201cpeople with common sense who actually love our nation, and are willing to work for our nation, and are more concerned about the next generation than the next election.\u201d How do Carson and Fiorina stack up in GOP race? And he also weighed in on the recent unrest in Baltimore, following the death of an African American man in police custody, declaring that the \u201creal issue is that people are losing hope\u201d because the economy isn\u2019t delivering for them. \u201cThey don\u2019t feel that life is going to be good for them, no matter what happens, so when an opportunity comes to loot, to riot, to get mine, they take it, not believing that there is a much better way to get the things that they desire,\u201d Carson said. Carson is so far the only African-American presidential candidate from either party. He cuts an unusual figure for the GOP, but that\u2019s part of his appeal for conservatives. He made his name in medicine by becoming the first surgeon to successfully separate conjoined twins at the head, and was played by Cuba Gooding, Jr. in a TNT adaptation of his memoir. Carson grew up poor in Detroit and went on to get degrees from Yale and the University of Michigan, ultimately going on to become the director of pediatric neurosurgery at Johns Hopkins by the age of 33. He\u2019s written six best-selling books, is a regular on the paid speaking circuit and was ranked the sixth most admired man in the world in a 2014 Gallup poll. And he has been brazenly critical of President Barack Obama\u2019s policies \u2014 often to the point of getting himself in trouble with his borderline incendiary comments, including times he\u2019s compared Obamacare to slavery and the U.S. to Nazi Germany. RELATED: Ben Carson stands by Nazi Germany comparison That unapologetic bluntness has made Carson a conservative star. He typically polls in the middle of the GOP presidential pack, ahead of second-timers like Rick Santorum and Rick Perry, and came in fourth at this year\u2019s Conservative Political Action Conference. But it\u2019s also the thing that could halt his rise in its tracks. He faces strong skepticism from the GOP establishment over his penchant for controversial comments, which many Republicans worry could create headaches for the whole party and jeopardize their chances in the general election. He told WKRC, however, that he\u2019s learned his lesson from those controversies. \u201cI don\u2019t wander off into those extraneous areas that can be exploited. I have learned that,\u201d he said. Two years ago, however, it was Carson\u2019s signature brashness that brought him to national prominence and launched his rise as a conservative star. Standing just feet from the president at the 2013 National Prayer Breakfast, Carson knocked Obama\u2019s policies, lamented the nation\u2019s decline and warned of the \u201cmoral decay and fiscal irresponsibility\u201d confronting America. The comments drew widespread plaudits from conservative commentators and, according to Carson, the ire of the White House. He refused to back down, and has struck a similarly aggressive tone in criticizing everything from gay marriage \u2014 which he\u2019s likened to beastiality \u2014 to Obamacare, which he\u2019s called \u201cthe worst thing that has happened in this nation since slavery.\u201d Carson did, however, recently apologize after telling CNN that being gay is a choice because people \u201cgo into prison straight \u2014 and when they come out, they\u2019re gay.\u201d In a subsequent Facebook post, Carson said that \u201cmy choice of language does not reflect fully my heart on gay issues.\u201d \u201cI do not pretend to know how every individual came to their sexual orientation. I regret that my words to express that concept were hurtful and divisive,\u201d Carson wrote. But he rarely walks such comments back because, he says, he has no use for the \u201cPC Police.\u201d While critics may see Carson as unpolished, he and his advisers believe his plainspoken style contributes to his appeal as a political outsider up against a spate of Washington and Republican Party insiders. That crusade against political correctness and the Washington establishment has helped him amass a strong grassroots conservative following that his advisers believe will help him lock down the funds he\u2019ll need to compete. His campaign reportedly plans to raise $65 million between now and the Florida GOP primary, and another $65 million after that. Carson\u2019s presidential exploratory committee ended March with nearly $1.7 million cash on hand, after raising over $2.1 million in the first three months of the year. But with his more prominent primary opponents planning to raise upwards of $100 million for their campaigns, Carson may struggle to break through the noise of an increasingly crowded Republican presidential primary. Still, the appeal of an African American Republican presidential candidate for a party looking to widen its reach is undeniable. Black voters traditionally back Democrats in presidential contests, but Republicans acknowledged following their surprising losses in 2012 that they\u2019ll need to do more to appeal to minority voters if they hope to compete nationally. Ben Carson apologizes for comments on gay people Some presidential contenders, most notably Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, have been working to reach out to African Americans and are pushing policy proposals they believe will appeal to that demographic, like criminal justice reform. Ben Carson: Prison proves being gay is a choice Dr. Ben Carson on Baltimore mom But Carson\u2019s ability to connect with African Americans may be hard to match. And though it\u2019s unlikely Republicans will make significant inroads with minorities this cycle, African Americans could help nudge a Republican candidate across the finish line in a tight primary, like South Carolina, or a tough general election swing state, like Michigan. Monday\u2019s announcement events signal Carson will embrace his heritage and profile as an African American Republican. He\u2019ll start the day with a breakfast with local pastors at the Charles H. Wright Museum of African American History, then will attend an assembly at a science-focused high school bearing his name. The day culminates in his official announcement event, at the Detroit Music Hall Center for the Performing Arts, where his campaign has teased an expected audience of 2,000. Carson is planning to head to Iowa after he announces for a three-day swing intended to cultivate support in what\u2019s likely to be a make-or-break state for him. Iowa\u2019s evangelical conservatives offer fertile ground for Carson\u2019s message, and he\u2019ll likely need to place in the top third of the field to prove his candidacy is viable. But the prospect of failure doesn\u2019t seem to faze Carson anyway. He\u2019s often said that he\u2019s only looking at the race because he\u2019s gotten strong encouragement from supporters and a nudge from God \u2014 not because he actually covets the White House. If he lost, he recently told the magazine of the American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons, \u201cI would say \u2018Whew!\u2019\u201d \u201cBecause it\u2019s not something I ever really wanted to do, and the only reason I\u2019d consider it is because there\u2019s so many people across the nation clamoring for me to do it,\u201d he added.",

            "article_content": "During his presidential campaign announcement, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio came out swinging with a punch list that included the popular Republican mantra to \u201crepeal and replace Obamacare.\u201d But the Department of Health and Human Services had already thrown a punch of its own earlier in April. Marco Rubio explained in under 90 seconds HHS released its updated list of enrollments by zip code and it turns out the top 15 are in Rubio\u2019s backyard - Miami-Dade and Broward counties.  In fact, the second highest zip code in the country is 33126, which lies just blocks from the City of West Miami, where Rubio got his political start.  That area saw 11,222 people sign-up for the healthcare benefits, in the enrollment period ending in February. That\u2019s roughly 4,000 less than the top Obamacare zip code in the United States, 33012, which is in the heart of Hialeah, a Republican stronghold. In the last presidential election, which was dominated with rhetoric about the Affordable Care Act, the so-called \u201cCity of Progress\u201d voted roughly 58% to 42% in favor of Mitt Romney. It\u2019s a red island in a sea of blue, when you take into account that surrounding Miami-Dade County has gone for a Democratic presidential nominee in every election since 1992. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t surprising to me,\u201d said Republican state senator Rene Garcia, who represents the 33012 area. \u201cFor many years, we\u2019ve had one of the highest uninsured rates in Miami-Dade County. By the implementation of the ACA, it\u2019s given them the opportunity to go out and purchase insurance.\u201d According to the U.S. Census Bureau, almost half of the city\u2019s population was uninsured, before Obamacare went into effect. Add to that two striking economic figures: 24.5% of residents live below the poverty line and there is a $14,321 per capita income. The result, Sen. Garcia said, \u201cit\u2019s not a Republican or Democrat issue. It\u2019s just the reality. And, the realities are that now they can afford health insurance for their families. And they\u2019ve gone out and done it.\u201d Closer look at Rubio, Bush friendship The intense marketing for the Affordable Care Act also drove enrollment. \u201cLast year, you saw a few signs here and there. But, if you go around this time, you see a bunch of Obamacare signs: on bus-stops, on buildings, across the entire region,\u201d said Nick Duran, Florida director for Enroll America, a left-leaning nonprofit organization, which promotes health coverage around the country. On the other side of the political spectrum, Republicans agree, the promotions worked. \u201cThey\u2019ve done a good job of getting the word out,\u201d Sen. Garcia said. In addition, Florida saw a huge jump in opportunities for people to sign-up during the open enrollment period, which ended in February. \u201cWe got a report from (insurance) carriers saying there were about 100 enrollment centers in all of Florida last year. I believe, this year, it\u2019s 4,200. I\u2019ve seen shoe stores that have Obamacare enrollment centers,\u201d said Ammer Cabrera, who runs Sunshine Life and Health Advisors. The demand was so high during the enrollment period, his agency opened two offices in the same shopping mall, just a couple hundred feet away from each other. \u201cI think a lot of people didn\u2019t understand what Obamacare was,\u201d said Cabrera. Nationwide, 16.4 million people have gained health insurance since the law went into effect, according to government data. The rate of uninsured in the United States has dropped below 10%.",

            "article_content": "Watch \u201cThe Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer\u201d Wednesday at 5 p.m. ET for an interview with Rand Paul. For Rand Paul, it\u2019s all led to this moment. Since riding the tea party wave into the Senate in 2010, Paul has carefully built a brand of mainstream libertarianism \u2013 dogged advocacy of civil liberties combined with an anti-interventionist foreign policy and general support for family values \u2013 that he bets will create a coalition of younger voters and traditional Republicans to usher him into the White House. The test of that theory began Tuesday when the Kentucky senator made official what has been clear for years: He\u2019s running for president. \u201cToday I announce with God\u2019s help, with the help of liberty lovers everywhere, that I\u2019m putting myself forward as a candidate for president of the United States of America,\u201d Paul said at a rally in Louisville. Paul immediately hit the campaign trail for a four-day swing through New Hampshire, South Carolina, Iowa and Nevada \u2013 the states that traditionally vote first in the primaries and caucuses. READ: Can Rand Paul escape his father\u2019s shadow? In his speech, he called for reforming Washington by pushing for term limits and a constitutional amendment to balance the budget. He argued that both parties are to blame for the rising debt, saying it doubled under a Republican administration and tripled under Obama. \u201cGovernment should be restrained and freedom should be maximized,\u201d he said. The line-up of speakers who introduced Paul sought to paint the senator as a nontraditional candidate with diverse appeal, and by the time he got on stage, he was the first white man to address the crowd. The speakers included J.C. Watts, a former congressman who\u2019s African-American; state Sen. Ralph Alvarado, who\u2019s Hispanic; local pastor Jerry Stephenson, who\u2019s African American and a former Democrat; and University of Kentucky student Lauren Bosler. \u201cHe goes everywhere. It doesn\u2019t matter what color you are. Rand Paul will be there,\u201d Stephenson said, firing up the crowd. So far, Paul joins only Texas Sen. Ted Cruz as a declared candidate for the GOP presidential nomination. \u201cHis entry into the race will no doubt raise the bar of competition,\u201d Cruz said in a statement welcoming Paul into the race. But the field is certain to grow in the months ahead with Jeb Bush, Chris Christie, Scott Walker, Lindsey Graham and others eyeing a campaign. Marco Rubio, a Florida GOP senator, is expected to launch his campaign next week. Bush, who said his 2016 decision is a \u201cwhile off,\u201d told reporters in Colorado Springs on Tuesday that \u201clibertarianism definitely has a place in the GOP\u201d but stressed that he differs with Paul on foreign policy. For now, the nomination is up for grabs with no clear front-runner. Paul came in third place at 12% in a CNN/ORC International Poll of Republicans. Bush led the pack at 16% while Walker came in second at 13%. Paul, the son of former Texas congressman and three-time presidential hopeful Ron Paul, will build on his father\u2019s legacy as a candidate eager to bring civil liberties to the forefront of the national dialogue. He\u2019s already used his perch on Capitol Hill to draw attention to those issues, including a 13-hour filibuster two years ago blasting the Obama administration\u2019s drone policies and a lawsuit against the National Security Agency\u2019s phone metadata collection effort. What's the difference between Ron Paul and Rand Paul? But Paul, 52, will split from his father in one important way: his approach to the campaign. Where Ron Paul often focused on creating a libertarian movement, Rand Paul is planning a more strategic, less purist operation that could have a hope of competing in a general election. The elder Paul sat on stage at the rally on Tuesday with his wife, though he\u2019s not expected to be a public face for his son\u2019s campaign. He merely attended the event as a \u201cproud papa,\u201d a source close to the senator said. Elected in 2010 with strong tea-party support, Rand Paul quickly rose to national fame in part due to his father\u2019s back-to-back White House runs in 2008 and 2012, but also because of Rand Paul\u2019s willingness to fight fellow Republicans. He engaged in a war of words with Chris Christie two years ago over national security and federal spending and, more recently, he\u2019s taken swipes at Bush over issues like Common Core and medical marijuana. Still, Paul has carefully worked to form inroads with establishment Republicans and other factions of the party\u2019s base. He\u2019s done so by becoming close political allies with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and backing mainstream candidates who competed against libertarian opponents during last year\u2019s midterms. He\u2019s also tried to make peace with national security Republicans, taking nuanced positions that try to shed an isolationist label while still showing his apprehension toward foreign intervention. Last year, for example, he supported limited airstrikes against ISIS but vigorously fought against arming Syrian rebels. While he bills himself as a conservative realist, Paul still tries to wear the mantle as the Republican most reluctant to take the country into war. \u201cI can tell you there will be one loud voice in our party saying, think of the unintended consequence,\u201d Paul said in Iowa two months ago. \u201cThink about what we\u2019re going to accomplish and whether it will work before we go to war.\u2019 I promise you that will always be something I take very, very seriously.\u201d The cautious foreign policy dance has drawn criticism from his father\u2019s supporters, who say Paul has become too moderate, and from hawkish Republicans who fear he wouldn\u2019t go far enough as commander in chief to tackle problems overseas. Democrats and some Republicans, meanwhile, have accused him of flip-flopping and pandering to donors. READ: Rand Paul: Washington\u2019s \u2018barnacled enablers\u2019 push for constant war On Tuesday,  the Foundation for a Secure & Prosperous America \u2013 a hawkish group from the right \u2013 released a $1 million television ad buy against Paul\u2019s foreign policy, which hits the airwaves nationally on cable, as well as in the key early states that Paul will visit this week. \u201cRand Paul is wrong and dangerous,\u201d says the narrator in the 30-second spot, arguing that Paul doesn\u2019t understand the threat of Iran\u2019s nuclear program. The ad ends with an image of a nuclear bomb detonating. Paul had been silent on the Iran deal until his speech on Tuesday, when he vowed to oppose any deal that doesn\u2019t guarantee Iran gives up its nuclear ambition. He also sought to sound aggressive on terrorism. \u201cThe enemy is radical Islam and not only will I name the enemy, I will do what ever it takes to defend America from these haters of mankind,\u201d he said. In an interview later Tuesday, Paul argued that the ad was \u201ccrazy\u201d and represented what he called the \u201cthe naivety of the neocons.\u201d \u201cThese loud, sort of juvenile voices putting pictures of bombs on ads, these are the people who are so reckless that it would be a grave danger to our country to ever have these people in charge of our country,\u201d he said in an interview with Sean Hannity on Fox News. In the same interview, Paul also weighed in for the first time on the religious freedom debate that took center stage last week after an Indiana law \u2013 which has since been changed\u2013 came under fire for what critics said was discrimination against gay and lesbian couples getting married. The 2016 Republican field largely came out in defense of the law, standing by the rights of small business owners such as florists and bakers to decline participating in same-sex weddings. Paul said he felt the law was \u201cunnecessary\u201d and that the country\u2019s founding fathers would be \u201caghast\u201d that laws needed to be in place to protect religious rights. \u201cThat being said,\u201d he added. \u201cI think the law ought to be neutral and we shouldn\u2019t treat people unfairly.\u201d Asked which takes precedence, religious liberty or same-sex marriage rights, Paul said, \u201cfreedom.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t think you can have coercion in a free society very well,\u201d he said. \u201cSo I would think we ought to try freedom in most of these things.\u201d Paul is actually running for two offices at the same time, trying to hold onto his Senate seat while also running for president. Kentucky\u2019s election laws say candidates can\u2019t appear on a ballot twice, but with reluctant support from McConnell, a Kentucky powerhouse, the state\u2019s GOP will likely change its presidential preference vote from a primary to a caucus. That would allow Paul to get around the rule. His interest in the Oval Office has never really been a secret. Shortly after the 2012 presidential election, he started crisscrossing the country to paint himself as a nontraditional Republican eager to court voters who don\u2019t typically live and vote in red areas. He spoke at historically black colleges and universities, as well as Democratic strongholds like inner city Detroit and the University of California, Berkeley, focusing on criminal justice reform and civil liberties, two issues he believes can bring more people into the Republican Party. \u201cLiberal policies have failed our inner cities,\u201d he said Tuesday. \u201cOur schools are not equal and the poverty gap continues to widen.\u201d But Democrats are eager to paint Paul as another member of the \u201csame old Republican Party.\u201d \u201cOn issue after issue his policies are the same as the rest of the GOP, but even more extreme, and will turn back the clock on the progress we have made,\u201d said Democratic National Committee chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz in a statement. As one of the few national politicians who went to Ferguson, Missouri, Paul frequently boasts that there is no \u201cbigger defender of minority rights in the Congress\u201d than himself. READ: Rand Paul dives back into Ferguson debate But those efforts could prove futile if he can\u2019t get beyond controversial comments he made in 2010, when he questioned parts of the Civil Rights Act, especially provisions that place restrictions on private property. He\u2019s steered clear of such hot-button issues more recently. Last week, for example, he was one of the few Republicans who didn\u2019t weigh in on religious freedom laws in Indiana and Arkansas that critics argued would allow businesses to discriminate against gays and lesbians. Paul has also worked to maintain a following that includes a large swath of young voters who he partly inherited from his father. Heavy on tech and social media, his political team has opened an office in Austin, Texas, and will soon establish one in the heart of Silicon Valley. Like clockwork, Paul frequently holds up his phone during his stump speech and declares that what people do on their smartphones is \u201cnone of the government\u2019s damn business.\u201d His nontraditional style is complemented by Paul\u2019s wardrobe. The senator is known for wearing blue jeans with boots and a blazer when he\u2019s on the trail, and during the winter, he opts for a turtleneck and sport coat rather than a tie. But in his quest to become a national figure, Paul\u2019s comments have come under scrutiny and some of his statements have led critics to question whether he\u2019s ready for prime time. Earlier this year, Paul, an ophthalmologist, lent credibility to theories that vaccinations cause mental disorders, and last fall he caused a stir when suggesting that people could catch Ebola at cocktail parties. And while he\u2019s not media shy\u2014he\u2019s given hundreds of interviews in the past year alone\u2014Paul can get short-tempered with reporters. He shushed a female interviewer in February, and last fall he blew up at a reporter who asked a question about foreign aid to Israel. CNN\u2019s Dana Bash contributed to this story.",

            "article_content": "Mitt Romney announced Friday he won't run for president again -- a decision he made a week ago While in Mississippi on Wednesday, he may have offered some hints that he wasn't going to be running While Mitt Romney announced he wouldn\u2019t run for president on Friday, he had personally come to that decision a week prior \u2013 well before he made campaign-style stop in Starkville Mississippi, on Wednesday that kept the national press scrutinizing his every statement for any hints about his political future. He shook hands and took selfies with young voters, attacked Hillary Clinton in a high profile speech, and laid out his thoughts about foreign and domestic policy\u2014all signs that suggested he was gearing up for a third presidential bid. But a closer look at the day\u2019s events\u2014and the benefit of hindsight\u2014reveal some clues that Romney knew at the time he wouldn\u2019t be throwing his hat in the ring. He talked more about the past than the future Speaking at Mississippi State University, Romney spent the first half of his speech talking almost entirely about his 2012 campaign when he was the Republican nominee. Many of the light-hearted and funny moments in the speech occurred while Romney used self-deprecating humor to describe the last presidential cycle. \u201cYou may not have heard: I lost,\u201d Romney said towards the beginning of his speech. He drew a big laugh from the audience when he said a supporter once advised him to stop shaving so he can \u201cgrow a little more stubble for a few days to look more sexy.\u201d \u201cAs if I needed that,\u201d Romney continued flatly. He lovingly recalled people he met on the campaign trail, labeling some of his most devoted followers in Iowa and New Hampshire \u201cheroes\u201d because they adamantly supported someone they believed in. He described the campaign as one of \u201cthe most remarkable of my life\u2019s journeys\u201d but spoke with a tone of finality when recalling that it would eventually come to an end. \u201cWhat we knew at the beginning was that win or lose, any acclaim would eventually be forgotten,\u201d he said. \u201cAs the 1940s song Jimmy Durante used to sing: \u2018Fame if you win it, comes and goes in a minute.\u2019\u201d Granted, it\u2019s a line he has used in previous speeches, but it\u2019s an example of how he was in a reflective mood. He declined to answer a question from the moderator about how he would run a potential campaign differently from 2012\u2014\u201dThat\u2019s another question I won\u2019t answer\u201d\u2014and went on to talk about how Republicans should do better at having a \u201cclear and compelling message,\u201d especially when talking to nontraditional GOP voters, like minorities and young people. He even suggested that Republicans have \u201cto stop thinking so much about the primary and start thinking more about making sure we have people that support us in the general election.\u201d That\u2019s pretty bold\u2014if not daring\u2014talk for a potential candidate. Jeb Bush, for example, got hammered in the conservative media for making a similar suggestion back in December. Romney appeared to sound more like he was angling to become a kingmaker than a candidate. He continually referred to a need for \u201cstrong leaders\u201d and \u201cleadership\u201d but didn\u2019t narrow down his remarks to talk rhetorically about a single leader. His policy ideas were vague It was on that very topic\u2014minority outreach\u2014that political observers were most closely trying to examine Romney\u2019s recent statements and comments. He won only 6% of the African American vote and 27% of the Hispanic vote in 2012. Speaking to the Republican National Committee earlier this month, Romney suggested the party needed to focus more on anti-poverty policies, and in his speech on Wednesday he laid out some of his ideas for tackling the issue. But his ideas were vague and lacked the kind of depth that would churn more interest in a potential campaign. He argued that the government, for example, was providing incentives for single mothers to stay on federal assistance and avoid marriage because they could lose their benefits once they became married. \u201cIf marriage \u2026 is essential to helping people to stay out of poverty, then we want to do the opposite,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want to create incentives for them to get married, not to not get married.\u201d He also said K-12 education needs to improve, and he encouraged creating incentives for people to hire workers who haven\u2019t worked before, but didn\u2019t outline specifics. Those come nowhere near close to some of the more serious proposals by his former running mate, Rep. Paul Ryan, or by Gov. Chris Christie and Sen. Rand Paul \u2013 who have made efforts to address poverty through criminal justice reform. Mystery and pulled pork Romney was noticeably more relaxed, not only in his speech, but at a barbecue joint he stopped at earlier in the day to meet with voters. He joked with the national reporters following him in the cramped space that there\u2019s an \u201cunwritten rule\u201d that politicians shouldn\u2019t be photographed while eating. But he continued to eat anyway. \u201cDo you still consider yourself a politician, then?\u201d one reporter asked, to which Romney replied: \u201cYou\u2019re taking my picture. What can I say?\u201d Another asked if this is \u201cthe new Romney,\u201d noting that he appeared not to care that he was eating before the cameras. \u201cI didn\u2019t know I had a choice,\u201d he shot back, drawing some laughs. A conversation Romney had with Mississippi State football coach Dan Mullen at the table also seemed to provide a window into perhaps some bitter feelings Romney still has about coverage from 2012. In politics, Romney argued, there\u2019s too much emphasis on what a person says, rather than what a person does. \u201cIt\u2019d be nice if people who run for office, that their leadership experience and what they\u2019ve accomplished in life would be a bigger part of what people focus on, but it\u2019s not,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s mostly what you say.\u201d What you do, Romney told Mullen, \u201cis a lot more important that what you say,\u201d noting how a football coach\u2019s reputation is almost entirely based on his record. \u201cYou could be the sweetest talking person in the world, but unless you got a record, you\u2019re in trouble,\u201d he said. Still, he was doing a meet-and-greet\u2014in his jeans and a plaid shirt like he used to\u2014and anyone watching him could have walked away thinking this was a \u201cgo.\u201d The mystery of his barbecue outing\u2013the will he or won\u2019t he\u2013was perfectly captured in a response Romney gave to one man who urged him to run again. \u201cYou\u2019re very kind,\u201d Romney replied, patting the man on the arm. \u201cI wish I were there right now, I gotta tell ya.\u201d CNN\u2019s Steve Brusk contributed to this report.",

Mitt Romney acknowledged Friday that he is once again considering running for the Republican presidential nomination, declaring that the country is in worse shape on both the domestic and foreign fronts since President Barack Obama took office. \u201cI\u2019m giving some serious consideration to the future,\u201d Romney said in remarks to members of the Republican National Committee. \u201cBut this I know, we can win in 2016 as a party in the House, in the Senate, and in the White House if we communicate a clear vision of where we are taking this country.\u201d Romney did not discuss specific details about his time frame or steps he would take in considering another run, but the 2012 GOP presidential nominee did note that his wife, Ann, was supportive of another presidential bid. \u201cNow, I should tell you the last few days the most frequently asked question I get is \u2018what does Ann think about all this,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cShe believes that people get better with experience.

When you take look at this \u2026 I don\u2019t think ever in history we have had such a strong field of candidates.\u201d A \u201cstrong field\u201d is one of the major obstacles facing Romney if he chooses to run again as well as calls for a fresh face for the GOP to put forward as the party nominee. Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, who is seriously considering running for president himself, emphasized that point several times Thursday night during his speech at the RNC. Maryland GOP Chair Diana Waterman said that people were \u201cintrigued\u201d by Romney\u2019s decision to consider another run, but noted Republican voters will be sizing up the full field of candidates before making a decision. \u201cThe bottom line is we want to choose a candidate that we\u2019re going to take all the way to the White House,\u201d she said. \u201cI am not sure who that is going to be yet.\u201d Even in New Hampshire, arguably Romney\u2019s strongest state of support outside of Utah, he would have to campaign hard to convince voters to give him another chance, said Jennifer Horn, chair of the New Hampshire Republican Party. \u201cObviously, Mitt comes into New Hampshire with a certain advantage, but all of the candidates have advantages and challenges they have to overcome,\u201d she said. \u201cGov. Romney has a strong base of loyal supporters in our state, but at the same time, he is going to have to set up an operation and win the votes one at a time just like everyone else. It is not a gimme for anybody.\u201d In his speech Friday, Romney highlighted \u201cthree principles\u201d that he thinks the GOP should emphasize heading into the next election: Making the world safer, increasing opportunity and lifting people out of poverty. It was in his pitch on national security that Romney not only hit the current president. He aimed his attack at a possible future opponent in 2016: former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. \u201cThe results of the Hillary Clinton-Barack Obama foreign policy have been devastating and you know that,\u201d Romney said at the San Diego gathering, citing terrorism in France, Nigeria and Yemen as examples of how policies from Obama and Clinton haven\u2019t worked to make America safer. It\u2019s been a busy week for the former 2012 Republican nominee, who is suddenly leaning in for a 2016 presidential run. Romney spent the past week phoning donors, former staffers and political backers, letting them know he was seriously thinking about entering the 2016 fray of Republican hopefuls. The gathering in Southern California has been a steady spotlight for prospective 2016 GOP presidential candidates such as as Walker, Dr. Ben Carson and Texas Gov. Rick Perry. Each delivered speeches to the state party leaders and activists. Coy about his own future, Rick Perry criticizes Obama",

            "article_content": "Clinton's economic rhetoric is straight from husband's 1992 playbook She has spoken of restoring \"the basic bargain of America\" Voter frustration is reminiscent of what the Clintons navigated in 1991 and 1992 If there were an obvious takeaway for the 2016 hopefuls this year, it might as well have been the motto for the 1992 presidential campaign of Bill Clinton: \u201cIt\u2019s the economy, stupid.\u201d So it is no wonder that many of Hillary Clinton\u2019s touchstones on the campaign trail this year have come straight from her husband\u2019s 1992 playbook \u2014 at times almost verbatim \u2014 a focus on rebuilding the middle class, addressing income inequality, and reviving the American promise that each generation should fare better than the last. The echoes of the early 1990s in Clinton\u2019s speeches as she weighs a run for the presidency are no accident. In what amounted to her first major foray on the campaign trail in September at retiring Iowa Democratic Sen. Tom Harkin\u2019s steak fry, she spoke of restoring \u201cthe basic bargain of America\u201d \u2013 one her husband had proposed in the 1992 campaign \u2013 that \u201cno matter who you are or where you come from, if you work hard and you play by the rules, you deserve the opportunity, the same opportunity as anyone else, to build a good life for yourself and your family.\u201d Flash back to Bill Clinton\u2019s speech in struggling Johnstown, Pa., in April of 1992. The American dream that he grew up with, Clinton said in a typical line from his stump speech, had been shattered for millions of Americans. \u201cThe idea,\u201d he said, \u201cthat if you worked hard and played by the rules you\u2019d be rewarded, you\u2019d do a little better next year than you do last year, and your kids will do better than you \u2014 that idea has been devastated.\u201d Dodging the big question: running in 2016? If she runs for president, pundits will invariably argue for the next two years over whether a Hillary Clinton White House would look more like a third term of Barack Obama or Bill Clinton \u2014 and Democrats face a difficult challenge holding on to the White House given that it often flips to the opposing party after eight years of one-party control. But when it comes to voter frustration and unease, Hillary Clinton may be on strikingly similar terrain to what she and her husband navigated in 1991 and 1992. \u201cYou just look at the statistics now and they really do match up with 1992,\u201d said Chris Lehane, a White House adviser to Bill Clinton in the 1990s. Given that the Clintons left the White House in the midst of an economic boom with unemployment at about 4%, Lehane argues that there are only upsides for the former Secretary of State in associating herself with her husband\u2019s tenure. \u201cShe benefits enormously from connecting herself to that time period, but it also requires putting out a vision that matches with today\u2019s challenges,\u201d Lehane said. \u201cIt really gets down to the basic idea of what needs to be in place in this day and age so that if you\u2019re a middle class family, your kids are actually going to have the opportunity to do better than you.\u201d READ: 7 things Hillary says at almost every speech Heading into 2016, the economy has been steadily recovering with unemployment dropping below 6%; as Bill Clinton campaigned in 1991, the economy was in a backward slide (unemployment rose from 6.8% in 1991 to 7.5%). But the pessimism many Americans feel is eerily comparable to when Hillary Clinton first stepped out on the national stage. Only about 23% of Americans said they were satisfied with the direction of the country in the 2014 Gallup survey, just a shade higher than what the polling firm measured in 1991 and 1992. In an August NBC News/WSJ poll, 60% of voters said they believed America was in a state of decline, compared with 63% who said that in December of 1991. There has been even greater erosion in the sense of hopefulness about the prospects of the younger generation. In December of 1991 and 1992, the number of Americans who said they were confident that life for the next generation would be better than their own was between 41% and 44%. This August that number sank to 21%. More than 3 decades of Bushes & Clintons Aligning with Bill Clinton\u2019s early \u201990s riff on the fading American dream, the December 2014 New York Times/CBS poll found that only 64% of Americans believe it is possible to start poor in this country, work hard and become rich \u2013 an even lower percentage than in the mid-1990s (70%). Republican Pollster Whit Ayres noted that Bill Clinton won in 1992 by wrapping his middle-class focused message around a policy agenda with conservative elements that appealed to a broader audience. \u201cBill Clinton in 1992 was running as a center-left Democrat who wanted to end welfare as we know it, he was for the death penalty, he ripped into Sister Souljah for saying we ought to have a week where we kill white people,\u201d Ayres said. By contrast, Hillary Clinton \u201cis for all the touchstones of the left today,\u201d he said, and has yet to show how she would win over more moderate voters. While Clinton ran as the candidate of strength and experience in 2008, Steve Schmidt, a Republican strategist who advised former President George W. Bush and 2008 Republican presidential nominee John McCain, said Clinton has yet to clearly outline a justification for her candidacy in 2016. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s readily apparent to anybody, including most every Democrat, what Hillary Clinton is running for president to do or to be, which was not ever the issue with Bill Clinton,\u201d Schmidt said. \u201cThere are change elections and there are \u2018more of the same\u2019 elections, and there was a lot of economic anxiety in the 1992 election and (Bill Clinton) was able to drive a change narrative.\u201d \u201cAfter eight years of Barack Obama, it\u2019s very difficult to understand what kind of change it is that Hillary Clinton\u2019s candidacy could represent,\u201d he said. To the extent that Hillary Clinton has hinted at her policy agenda, she has not been shy about suggesting that she would build on her husband\u2019s legacy, which she took part in shaping as his informal strategist, sounding board and speech editor. The central thread through many of Clinton\u2019s political speeches in recent months has once again been the idea of championing the middle class \u2014 the \u201cinvisible Americans\u201d as she called them in 2008 \u2014 or \u201cfighting for the forgotten middle class\u201d as her husband\u2019s 1992 campaign brochure framed his version of that message. When talking about expanding paid family leave, for example, she often notes that the Family and Medical Leave Act was the first bill her husband signed in the White House. She has also reminded audiences that he signed legislation that raised the minimum wage in 1996, as she makes the case for another increase. When addressing economic angst while campaigning for Democratic hopeful Bruce Braley in Iowa in late October, she alluded to the Clinton White House years as a kind of golden era: \u201cMillions of new jobs were created, more families made it into the middle class, and more families got lifted out of poverty,\u201d she said. Moving beyond nostalgia, she has also tried out variations of the 1992 campaign lines. In seeking to connect, she has echoed the motto that her husband used in his 1992 convention speech: \u201cI am a product of the middle class and when I am president, you will be forgotten no more.\u201d \u201cI am a product of the American middle class,\u201d she said at the Women in the World Conference in April, adding that she wanted other American children to have the opportunities she had. At the Harkin Steak Fry, she lamented that American families \u201care working harder than ever\u201d but finding that maintaining a middle class lifestyle is like \u201crolling a boulder uphill.\u201d Cue the tape again to Bill Clinton\u2019s 1992 convention speech: \u201cPeople are working harder than ever,\u201d he said, \u201cand their incomes are still going down.\u201d When she was by his side during a 1992 bus tour from New York to St. Louis, Bill Clinton sought to strengthen his connection with working class voters by saying he was \u201ctired of the dignity being stripped from blue collar work in America.\u201d When Hillary Clinton went to Pennsylvania in October, she carried that theme forward while campaigning for Democratic gubernatorial candidate Tom Wolf. \u201cThere is nothing but dignity in hard work,\u201d she said in that speech, calling for greater respect for the jobs held by her own generation and that of her parents. If the winning strategy for any candidate in 2016 is to show an understanding of the economic angst that voters are feeling \u2014 and policies to address it \u2014 Republican strategists point out that Clinton\u2019s other hurdle will be that her husband was far more natural in showing his empathy for others as he delivered that message. READ: Clinton backpedals on claim that businesses don\u2019t create jobs In anticipation of her run, Republicans have pounced on every opportunity to argue that it has been a long time since the Clintons were a struggling young couple in Arkansas \u2014 focusing on their wealth and her hefty speech fees. \u201cShe has lived a pretty gilded life for the last couple of decades,\u201d said Republican strategist Katie Packer Gage, referring to the trappings of Clinton\u2019s various roles as First Lady, Senator and Secretary of State like her security detail. \u201cWhen\u2019s the last time that she got into a cold car?\u201d Clinton\u2019s most notable stumble in that arena was when she told ABC\u2019s Diane Sawyer during her book tour that she and her husband were \u201cnot only dead broke, but in debt\u201d when they left the White House, as they struggled to pay mortgages on several homes and their daughter\u2019s private school education.  She quickly sought to clarify her remarks on \u201cGood Morning America.\u201d \u201cI fully appreciate how hard life is for so many Americans today,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s an issue that I\u2019ve worked on and cared about my entire life.\u201d In 2016, Republicans will be looking for every opportunity to make her prove it.",

He is the author of  \u201cCitizen Hollywood: How the Collaboration Between L.A. and D.C. Revolutionized American Politics.\u201d The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. Tim Stanley:  Media questioning Rubio, Carson about their pasts. In Carson's case, gauging truth of youthful violence. Is this fair? He says Carson's claim that Obama given slide by media is not true, but overall coverage in past elections is favorable toward Dems Dogs bite men and reporters dig up muck on politicians. So it\u2019s no surprise that Marco Rubio and Ben Carson have both been the subject of intense press scrutiny into their pasts. They should be grateful \u2013 it confirms that they are riding high in the polls. The only questions that really matter about this vetting process are a) Is it accurate? and b) Is it fair? Conservatives complain that their candidates get grilled much more than the Democrats do. They may well be right. How accurate are the charges against Rubio and Carson? Credit card statements released by Rubio\u2019s campaign reveal that he used a state GOP credit card to cover a few personal expenses when he was a leader in the Florida House, an accusation with echoes of the scandal that nearly derailed Richard Nixon\u2019s bid to be vice president in 1952. But it turns out that it was standard practice at the time, he spent less than his successors and he says that while mistakes were made, he did repay the money. His opponents will use this to hammer him in the future but, like the charge that he\u2019s been underattending the Senate, it\u2019s an attack that\u2019s easily dismissed. \u201cWho hasn\u2019t had problems with a credit card?\u201d is a line that might get a lot of sympathy from Americans. Carson, by contrast, is in more troubled waters. His problem is that he\u2019s being vetted for the very first time, which means that every skeleton in his closet is being revealed at once. Moreover, without a legislative or executive background to run on, all Carson has is his personal story. Anything that causes people to re-evaluate that story hurts him enormously. Last week, Politico questioned Carson\u2019s biographical claim that he had received an offer of a full scholarship to West Point. Team Carson countered that the conversation about the scholarship was informal and the candidate had privately declined. Meanwhile, The Wall Street Journal has challenged the claim in his memoir, \u201cGifted Hands,\u201d that he impressed a psychology professor at Yale with his honesty; and CNN tried and failed to find anyone who can corroborate his assertion that as a misguided youth he had violent episodes, one in which he tried to stab a friend. (The Carson campaign since produced a Parade magazine article from 1997 in which his mother alludes to the stabbing incident.) Again, Carson has answers to these questions, some of which hinge on the fact that biographies often change names, places and dates  to protect sources or simply because the precise facts have been forgotten. In a superb summary of the whole mess, David A. Graham notes that \u201cCarson told many of these stories in the context of his career as a motivational speaker, where embellishment for effect and inattention to specifics would be more acceptable than in a presidential race.\u201d Graham also points out that some conservatives are increasingly numb to attacks on their preferred candidates because they perceive bias in the reporting. This narrative is arguably protecting movement favorites from the negative effects of scandal. Carson has said: \u201cI do not remember this level of scrutiny for one President Barack Obama when he was running.\u201d Bias is in the eye of the beholder but does this accusation of double-standards hold up? No and yes. No because Obama in 2008 had to deal with a lot of scrutiny surrounding his birth certificate and the politics of his preacher Jeremiah Wright. It\u2019s absurd to say that the President wasn\u2019t vetted when he had to actually go on television and record a speech explaining what the Rev. Wright meant when he said, \u201cGod damn America.\u201d But while there\u2019s no doubt that Obama\u2019s biography did become a major issue, much of the media handled it in a subtly different manner to the treatment of Carson\u2019s past. Compare the degree of scrutiny of Obama\u2019s memoir, \u201cDreams of My Father,\u201d vs. \u201cGifted Hands.\u201d For instance, it was only three years into Obama\u2019s presidency that Obama\u2019s creation of a composite girlfriend in his memoir was properly discussed \u2013 along with what these women had to reveal about his private self. And it was around the same time that someone managed to stay awake long enough while reading this rather dull and vain memoir to notice that the author casually admitted having eaten a dog. That this story slipped out at the same time that Mitt Romney was being savaged for once transporting a pooch on the top of his car was identified by the Right as proof that Democrats get a gentler ride. Evidence for that assertion is found in research into the positive vs. negative coverage of partisan stories in the 2008 election cycle, and it\u2019s there in one more comparison between Obama and Carson. In covering Obama the media has largely, and rightly, been sensitive to issues of race and class. Obama\u2019s rise from poverty to academic to senator to president is a great testament to the American Way, and journalists have typically respected his achievements and even trumpeted them. In the case of Carson, however, some have been more inclined to sneer. When photographs were released from Carson\u2019s house showing mock-classical interiors and walls papered in citations and self-portraits, it wasn\u2019t hard to detect an air of snobbery in the framing of those images. Maybe Carson is a massive egotist. But he has just a much right to be as Barack Obama. If I were a black working-class kid who became a neurosurgeon and a presidential candidate, I\u2019d probably put a few certificates on my wall, too. Rubio and Carson probably aren\u2019t perfect people. But at this stage in the race conservatives still have good cause to stand by them.

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Frida Ghitis is a world affairs columnist for the Miami Herald and World Politics Review and a former CNN producer and correspondent. Follow her @FridaGhitis. The opinions expressed in this commentary are hers. Ghitis: Venezuela is afflicted by a collapsing economy, toxic politics as parliamentary election looms She says post-Chavez government has continued with ruinous policies For a fleeting few years the South American nation of Venezuela and its histrionic late President Hugo Chavez made waves on the global stage. While he upended the country\u2019s economy and exploited class conflict at home, he blamed the world\u2019s woes on the U.S., insulted the American president at the United Nations, and exhorted other leftists in the region to challenge the prevailing economic model and follow his path to \u201c21st century socialism.\u201d Since Chavez died, the world mostly stopped paying attention. That, however, may soon change. The stage is now set for what could become a major confrontation. Under pressure from a jailed opposition leader on hunger strike, the government finally set an election date.  On December 6, Venezuelans will go to the polls to elect a new National Assembly. The stakes are enormous, and the possibility of serious turmoil is very real. President Nicolas Maduro, Chavez\u2019s hand-picked successor, already warned that if the opposition wins, \u201cvery grave things will occur,\u201d saying a \u201cprocess of confrontation\u201d will be unleashed, vowing he will be first to take to streets to \u201cdefend the revolution.\u201d When opposition candidates started trying to register for the election last week, they discovered that election authorities, loyal to the government, were already barring them from running for office. And the judiciary system will offer no relief. As international human rights groups just reiterated, the justice system is nothing but a tool against government critics and rivals, with judges and prosecutors obediently serving the President\u2019s political objectives. Still, the opposition is looking forward to winning this election as popular frustration with increasingly dire economic and security conditions turn a growing number of people against the regime. A significant number of Venezuelans, perhaps 25%, remains loyal to the legacy of the charismatic Chavez. But there is a very good chance that the opposition will try to launch a recall campaign against the hapless Maduro. The ingredients for a crisis are in place: Anger, frustration, visceral enmity between two camps and a sense of unfair play. The only way to prevent a greater disaster is making sure that fair elections take place, opening a peaceful path, a political avenue for working across the country\u2019s deep divide. But the prospects do not look good. The Venezuelan people have endured a catastrophic economic collapse that is sure to grow worse in the months ahead. If someone had set out to destroy the country they could hardly have done it more effectively than Chavez and his chosen heir, who has followed the same disastrous policies, driving the country into the abyss. Venezuela has the world\u2019s largest oil reserves, but the country is essentially bankrupt. Last November it started importing, of all things, oil. There are shortages of practically every conceivable consumer product, from toilet paper to beer, from milk to antibiotics. A shopping expedition is an exercise in frustration and endurance. Venezuelans have to stand in line for hours in the stifling tropical heat in pursuit of products that are more often than not completely out of stock. As his predecessor did, Maduro blames the shortages on the opposition, on his political enemies, and on the rich. But the real reason why the economy is simply not functioning is that the government has introduced wrong-headed policies that defy all logic. What started as an effort to alleviate poverty \u2013 the most worthy of goals in a poor country \u2013 turned into a failed experiment in populist-infused socialism. The government expropriated businesses, tried to control prices and markets, and generally disrupted the mechanisms of supply and demand to the point where producing anything became unprofitable. The first and biggest target of government intervention was the state-owned oil company, PDVSA, which was used by the Chavez government as a funding source for social programs. What was once an efficient, profitable, well-run business became a political tool run by party loyalists. Instead of investing in maintenance and production, the government wrung out all it could from its oil firm, using cheap oil to buy the loyalty of Latin American regimes, and using the profits to finance a multitude of unrelated projects. If done with more foresight it might have worked, but in the end it all came crashing down. This all started during the years when oil prices spiked above $100 a barrel, bringing oceans of money, none of which was used to expand production and maintain equipment. The government broke the piggy bank. Oil production has collapsed. And, making matters worse, much worse, the world price of oil, the lifeblood of the regime and the country, has fallen by about half. The country\u2019s cash flow problems were already serious before oil prices swooned. They will only get worse now. In a desperate effort to hold on to scarce dollars, the government has imposed a dizzying system of currency controls, with four different exchange rates.  In 2003, the official rate stood at 1.6 Bolivars per dollar. A year ago the rate stood at 79 per dollar. Today you can get about 700 bolivars for a dollar on the black market. The government also helped itself to the nation\u2019s hard currency reserves, using what is meant to be saved as the economic ballast to fund social programs. Now those reserves stand at record lows and the economy is about to crash into a wall. The inflation rate is so high that authorities have stopped reporting the latest statistics. The last official report last year put it at 68%, but economists say it\u2019s now well into triple digits. The economy is in a deep recession.  Again, no official figures are available. What makes the situation truly perilous is the political polarization that Chavez and Maduro stoked with such gusto. The country is divided into two camps that despise each other. The depth of animosity makes divisions in Washington seem tame. For every problem, for every shortage, for every crime, for every failed policy, Maduro blames the opposition; he accuses businesses of hoarding and speculating to destroy his government. Venezuela will make headlines in the coming months. If a total collapse  ensues, the repercussions will be felt throughout the region and the hemisphere. The only way to prevent it is for the international community to demand fair elections. Maduro has already rejected international observers, saying, \u201cVenezuela is not and will not be monitored by anyone.\u201d  But there is still a way to prevent disaster if Maduro can be convinced to let democracy take its course.

Against the backdrop of these elections is the ongoing threat and destabilization caused by Boko Haram, a group that has killed more than 10,000 people in northeastern Nigeria during its five-year campaign of terror, and kidnapped hundreds more, including young girls. These actions have shocked and horrified Americans. What many Americans may not recognize is how important the relationship with Nigeria is for the United States.  We have economic and security interests that are at stake in this election, especially as Nigeria has been one of our strongest allies in the region since military rule there ended. In the last decade, the U.S. has trained and equipped thousands of Nigerian soldiers who have participated in peacekeeping missions in Mali, Cote d\u2019Ivoire and Liberia, helping bring a measure of peace and stability to nations in the West Africa region. But now we need Nigeria to be a front-line ally against terrorism, particularly as Boko Haram pledges fidelity to the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria. Meanwhile, Nigeria also has the largest economy in Africa and has the continent\u2019s largest population. Indeed, it has been identified as one in the next set of prominent emerging economies, making it a tantalizing target for U.S. private investment. It is also Africa\u2019s No. 1 oil producer, although an increasingly diversified economy \u2013 for example in the agriculture sector \u2013 provides a myriad of opportunities for more robust trade with the United States. Ultimately, a stable Nigeria will mean real economic opportunities for Americans \u2013 a win-win proposition. One of Nigeria's most dangerous jobs Yet despite this potential, the uncertain electoral environment and other serious challenges stand in the way of a deeper bond. The reality is that endemic corruption remains an obstacle to more cooperation, especially when you consider the Nigerian military\u2019s poor performance fighting Boko Haram, despite security spending reportedly being around $6 billion last year \u2013 clearly, much of the money meant for the military is not being spent on salaries, equipment or materiel. Similarly, weak governance remains an impediment to Nigeria\u2019s progress and enhanced ties with the United States. Nearly 70% of those in areas in the north live in absolute poverty, according to recent data, as compared to about 50% in southern areas of the country.  Such failure on the part of the government to address poverty and inequality facilitates Boko Haram\u2019s recruitment effort and foments internal instability. Boko Haram refugees find hardship in camps The Nigerian people clearly believe that these issues must be addressed.  According to an Afrobarometer survey released in January, 74% of Nigerian citizens said that their country is going \u201cin the wrong direction.\u201d  Half of Nigerians surveyed expressed significant concern about political intimidation or violence in the current election environment. If the Nigerian leadership rises to the challenge of tackling these difficult issues, there is nothing standing in the way of even closer ties between our two countries. But it is not just about the leadership \u2013 this election offers the chance for all Nigerians to choose their future, and decide which policies will shape the next four years.  Their example, for better or worse, will be watched \u2013 and perhaps even replicated by other African states. The decisions made in the coming days and weeks will shape U.S.-Nigeria relations for years to come. But more importantly, they will determine the future for Nigeria\u2019s people. The world is watching Nigeria\u2019s historic choice with great expectation and even greater hope. Read CNNOpinion\u2019s new Flipboard magazine. Follow us on Twitter @CNNOpinion.

Data debacle:  Last night, the Democratic National Committee went all Soup Nazi on the Bernie Sanders campaign and said, \u201cNo voter data for you!\u201d Why? Because at least one campaign staffer couldn\u2019t resist a little look-see at what the Hillary camp was cooking when a software snafu in the DNC site left that info exposed. The Sanders\u2019 team fired the curious staffer. But now it finds itself suspended from the DNC voter database. That\u2019s huuuuge because campaigns use that treasure trove of info to plot strategy. Firefighters killed: Three firefighters died battling blazes in north-central Washington state Wednesday, when they were overcome by flames after they had a vehicle accident.

            "article_content": "The scene opens with a pudgy white man plopped on a couch, watching TV with a bowl of Cheetos on the coffee table. As he reaches for the remote, disaster strikes. He knocks over the bowl, and his Cheetos spill on the floor. The man throws his head back in operatic despair and raises his hands to heaven as two words appear on the screen: \u201cThanks Obama.\u201d Yep, thanks President Obama. You ran for office vowing to unite us, but instead you gave us race-baiting, race riots and Black Lives Matter. You turned the promise of a post-racial era into one of the most racial periods in American history. At least, that\u2019s the standard Obama critique that the viral Cheetos GIF mocks with its sarcastic caption. Barack Obama is indeed seen as one of the most polarizing presidents in American history, according to numerous polls. Much of that polarization revolves around race. The author Ishmael Reed calls Obama the Exorcist in Chief, someone whose mere presence in the Oval Office summoned \u201call the demons of American racism \u2026 from the sewer.\u201d What\u2019s going to happen to those demons, though, once Obama leaves office?  Will racial tensions ease once his term ends? Or is racial strife the new normal? A recent CNN and Kaiser Family Foundation poll could point to an answer. The survey asked people from various ethnic groups about their impression of race relations, and their answers don\u2019t offer much in the way of hope or change.  Most Americans told the CNN/KFF poll that racial strife is getting worse. When asked whether tensions between racial and ethnic groups have increased during the past decade, 64% said yes, as did a majority of whites (67%), blacks (65%) and Latinos (55%). All those numbers are up significantly from April 2001, when only 29% of Americans said tensions had worsened over the previous 10 years. They\u2019re also significantly higher than in the wake of the Million Man March in 1995, when 47% thought tensions had increased. But when some of this year\u2019s respondents and other observers were asked in follow-up interviews about the source of this surge in racial tension, their answers were as splintered as the nation\u2019s electorate. Consider the question of whether racial strife is now the norm. \u201cI don\u2019t see that stopping when Obama is no longer president,\u201d says Steve Sailer, who writes for Unz Review and Taki\u2019s Magazine, both started by alumni of The American Conservative. \u201cI can imagine a white president like Hillary [Clinton] upping the ante because she doesn\u2019t have the benefit of being black.\u201d Sailer says Clinton will need to talk more about racial grievances to attract minority voters because she can\u2019t count on the strong black support that Obama enjoyed. Democrats, he says, have decided to build a coalition of \u201cfringe\u201d groups by demonizing people who \u201chave rightful reasons for representing the core of Middle America.\u201d That decision, however, is sparking a white backlash, Sailer warns. More whites are starting to see the need to unite like other ethnic groups. \u201cIt\u2019s become more acceptable for people to insult whites, especially white men,\u201d he says. \u201cYou\u2019re seeing more and more whites starting to develop a certain amount of white identity.\u201d Persistent racial tension, though, may actually be good for America, another writer suggests. \u201cI actually like where things are now, and I hope they don\u2019t change until progress comes,\u201d says Issac J. Bailey, a commentator who wrote a recent Politico essay that went viral: \u201cI\u2019m the GOP\u2019s Ideal Black Voter.\u201d Bailey is also author of the book, \u201cProud. Black. Southern. (But I Still Don\u2019t Eat Watermelon in front of White People).\u201d \u201cWe are confronting issues instead of walking around in a kind of phony peace,\u201d Bailey says. \u201cThat\u2019s not a bad thing.\u201d Then there is the question of blame. How much responsibility for increased racial tension rests with Obama? Could he have done anything at the beginning of his first term to reduce them? The answers are also varied. For starters, a previous poll found that in 2011 \u2013 well into Obama\u2019s first term \u2013 only 28% of Americans felt that racism was a big problem, compared with 49% in the 2015 CNN/KFF poll. Also, social media, online comments and access to smartphone cameras have grown tremendously since Obama was first elected. Accusations that police use excessive force against African-Americans, for example, now can get far more attention \u2013 far more quickly \u2013 than ever. Eduardo Bonilla-Silva, a professor of sociology at Duke University, calls it part of the \u201cnew racism.\u201d Communities of color across the country can more easily connect, according to Bonilla-Silva, and people are picking up on patterns that scholars have long discussed. \u201cPeople are doing Sociology 101. They can connect Walter Scott, the assassinations of black folks in a church, the slamming of a girl in a school,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd then it\u2019s across the nation. People are then connecting the dots and saying, \u2018No more.\u2019 \u201c Obama ran as someone who could transcend the nation\u2019s racial divisions, many people interviewed for this story said. He declared during his keynote address at the 2004 Democratic Convention, \u201cThere is not a liberal America and a conservative America. There is a United States of America.\u201d And during his 2008 speech on race in Philadelphia, he said, \u201cWorking together we can move beyond some of our old racial wounds, and that in fact we have no choice if we are to continue on the path of a more perfect union.\u201d When, though, was the last time you heard someone seriously talk about the onset of a \u201cpost-racial America\u201d? For some people, revisiting that term is like unearthing love letters they wrote as a teenager: embarrassing. The letdown over the post-racial promise many hoped Obama\u2019s election would bring was memorably captured in an open letter Beth Reinhard wrote for the National Journal in 2013 under the headline, \u201cBarack Obama: A Divider, not a Uniter.\u201d She wrote: Mr. President, We thought you were different, but you turned out to be like all the others. You promised hope and change \u2026 but the red states and blue states are farther apart than ever. \u2026 How could you Signed,Hopeless and Changed (for the worse) One poll respondent didn\u2019t have his heart broken because he never believed in Obama in the first place. Robert Randall, who lives in Hillsborough, North Carolina, said in the CNN/KFF poll that racial tension had increased during the past decade. When asked why, he blamed it on Obama. Randall, 68, ticked off the reasons: Obama did nothing when Black Panther Party members intimidated voters at a polling station during the 2008 election; he sent an entourage to the funeral of Michael Brown \u2013 a black man whose death in Ferguson, Missouri, sparked protests in 2014 \u2013 but sent no one to the funeral of a U.S. Army recruiter shot to death in Arkansas five years earlier; and he took the side of a black Ivy League professor, Henry Louis Gates, who was arrested in his home by a white police office, before getting the facts.   \u201cHe shows sympathy toward blacks,\u201d Randall, who is white, says of Obama. \u201cHe\u2019s done that in several instances. He whines about you don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like to be black.\u201d Randall says the character of Americans has eroded under Obama. He says no one in his family got divorced and everyone worked hard when he was growing up. Randall put himself through college by working in a textile mill. But under Obama, he says, the government wants to tax corporations and the wealthy to support social programs that coddle the moochers. \u201cWhen you introduce socialism in this country, it sends a message that you can take money from the hard-working people and give it to the slackers,\u201d he says. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, who\u2019s running for the GOP presidential nomination, also recently blamed Obama for a worsening racial divide. \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone can look objectively at where we sit as a country now and say that we\u2019re better off than we were seven years ago on the issue of race in America with Barack Obama as president,\u201d Christie told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper on \u201cThe Lead.\u201d \u201cIn fact, I think he\u2019s made it worse.\u201d Christie also said Obama has not succeeded in his promise to bring the country together, something Obama campaigned on in 2008. \u201cWe all had great hope, all of us, even those who didn\u2019t vote for him \u2013 and I didn\u2019t \u2013 in 2008, had great hope that the first African-American president would help to heal some of the divides that we have racially in this country.\u201d A New York scholar and activist, though, says blaming Obama for a rise in racial venom is ludicrous because he\u2019s been the primary target. Mark Naison, a professor of history and African-American studies at Fordham University, says some whites are angry because their portion of the country\u2019s population is shrinking. As the country gets browner, they get angrier. \u201cThey think this is their country, and they\u2019re really special,\u201d Naison says. \u201cThese tensions are going to get worse. We\u2019re stumbling toward being a more multiracial society with everyone\u2019s culture respected and everyone having a shot at leadership.\u201d Naison says he\u2019s not surprised by the surge in racial tension.  He saw signs of it while campaigning for Obama in 2008. \u201cI\u2019m never surprised at the depth of racism in America,\u201d he says. \u201cThe depths of it are limitless. There is a well you can dig into if you are white that justifies almost any level of abuse that you can direct at a black person that challenges your comfort zone.\u201d Obama, though, could have diffused some of the racial tension during his presidency by reaching out more aggressively to working-class whites, Naison says. He made a tactical error when he decided to create a new health care program early in his first term when Democrats controlled Congress. It was at the height of the Great Recession, and although Obama enacted the economic stimulus program, Naison says Obama should have done more \u2013 by following the example of Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who came into the Oval Office amid the Great Depression emphasizing massive government works programs that created jobs. \u201cThat was his one chance to win over the low- and moderate-income whites that are deeply suspicious of him,\u201d Naison says. \u201cHe could have won over whites with a New Deal jobs program rather than a health care act.\u201d Bailey, the author, says Obama could have reduced racial animosity by doing something even more personal. \u201cIf Obama really wanted to tackle it head-on, I think he should start, not in places like Ferguson, but in places like Kentucky and among the white people most afraid of what he represents,\u201d Bailey says. \u201cAnd I don\u2019t mean go there and lecture to them, but to go and listen \u2013 even if they are angry and call him names. They need to vent their frustration and know that they need to be heard.\u201d Still, there was some optimism buried in the interviews following the CNN/KFF survey. One respondent who lives in Vermont, one of the whitest states in the nation, agreed that racial tension had increased in the past decade. Sean, who preferred to be identified only by his first name, blames the increase on social media and simple racism \u2013 not Obama. Sean talked with a self-awareness about race that seemed remarkable for his 27 years. He says he is Brazilian by heritage but looks white. Because of his Anglo appearance, he says, he often overhears racist remarks that pop up during casual conversations with whites. \u201cI don\u2019t actually experience racial discrimination,\u201d Sean says. \u201cI recognize that I experience a level of comfort and privilege that some of my friends [of color] don\u2019t experience. I never once had to think twice about putting on a hood when it\u2019s cold, but I have a [black] friend who has.\u201d Empathy, though, will only go so far in easing the racial tensions of the Obama era because they go beyond having a black man in the Oval Office, says Paul Street, an author and historian who has written several books about Obama and his time in office, including \u201cThey Rule: The 1% v. Democracy.\u201d \u201cA lot of what drives bad race relations is scarcity in the working-class populations,\u201d he says. \u201cWe have all of these looming questions with globalization and downsizing. These are underlying structural problems.\u201d While some complain Obama hasn\u2019t reached out enough to whites, others say he hasn\u2019t done much for blacks either. \u201cBecause of his skin color,\u201d Street says, \u201che has been reluctant more than any other Democratic president in recent memory to talk about racism and to advance race-specific policies that help poor black people.\u201d Street expects no reprieve when Obama leaves office. If Hillary Clinton wins the presidency, Street says the \u201chate machine\u201d likely will switch targets. \u201cThe identity politics will probably shift from race to gender,\u201d he says. And if someone else wins in 2016, Fordham\u2019s Naison suggests that the racial demons that stalked Obama\u2019s presidency may even get worse. \u201cIf you think there\u2019s racial tension now,\u201d he says, \u201cwait until Donald Trump is elected.\u201d The CNN/Kaiser Family Foundation poll was conducted August 25-October 3 among a random national sample of 1,951 adults, including 501 black and 500 Hispanic respondents. Results for all groups have been adjusted to reflect their actual national distribution. Interviews were conducted on conventional telephones and cell phones, in English and Spanish, by SSRS of Media, Pennsylvania. This poll was jointly developed and analyzed by CNN and staff at the Kaiser Family Foundation. Results for the full sample have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3 percentage points; for results based on African Americans or Hispanics, it is plus or minus 6 percentage points.",

            "article_content": "This political season is not like the others Political opponents have become sassier, savvier and funnier when it comes to attacking rivals This political season is not like the others. Political opponents have become sassier, savvier and funnier when it comes to attacking rivals \u2013 using social media and humor to add insult to political injury. Some \u2013 including Republican presidential front-runner Donald Trump and New York Democratic Congressman Charlie Rangel \u2013 have made trolling into an art. Now that it\u2019s the end of the year, here\u2019s a look back at some great examples of trolling: Known as one of the most memorable moments from the already colorful presidential election cycle (so far), Trump made waves by releasing Lindsey Graham\u2019s cell phone number live at a campaign event. He urged attendees at the event in South Carolina, where Graham serves as a senior senator, to call the number. \u201cGive it a shot,\u201d Trump said. The cell phone number turned out to be, indeed, Graham\u2019s personal cell phone number. Later, the then-Republican presidential candidate, who dropped out of the race last week, partnered with Independent Journal to release a joke video about him destroying his flip phone now that everyone had the number. Ever since his response to the State of the Union in 2013 \u2013 where Marco Rubio awkwardly grabbed for and drank from a bottle of water just off screen mid speech \u2013 the incident has been a rolling political joke around the Internet. In October, Trump revived the meme sending Rubio \u201cTrump Ice Natural Spring Water.\u201d Rubio himself has poked fun at himself after the incident in the past, and has even brought it up during one of the 2015 Republican debates. On October 8, Rangel decided to skip the first House Speaker vote and make himself a smoothie \u2013 and then tweeted about it. The 85-year-old congressman from New York tweeted, \u201cMade myself a smoothie in my office & watching news about GOP mtg to elect next Speaker not going smoothly\u201d with photos of him in his office making the smoothie and then holding it at his desk. Made myself a smoothie in my office & watching news about GOP mtg to elect next Speaker not going smoothly pic.twitter.com/rlSd3AJIn6 The tweet came during the news that House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy dropped out of the race to succeed then-House Speaker John Boehner, causing chaos within Congress because the move was unexpected among his colleagues. The smoothie tweets didn\u2019t end there. After New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie was kicked out of an Amtrak car after talking to loud on his cell phone while holding a McDonald\u2019s smoothie, Rangel saw an opportunity. He tweeted at the presidential candidate on October 26, \u201cUnlike @GovChristie I keep quiet in quiet car & blend my own smoothie w/ real fruit (tho it 2 may not go smoothly)\u201d Unlike @GovChristie I keep quiet in quiet car & blend my own smoothie w/ real fruit (tho it 2 may not go smoothly) pic.twitter.com/lrKy0bdplr Chris Christie didn\u2019t respond to Rangel\u2019s tweet. Also in October, Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign said that they sent her newest autobiography \u201cHard Choices\u201d to her GOP presidential rivals as a way to show off her accomplishments while she was secretary of state. \u201cI understand that you and your fellow Republican candidates for president were questioning my record of accomplishments at your last debate, so I thought you might enjoy reading my book, \u2018Hard Choices,\u2019\u201d Clinton\u2019s letter to her potential rivals said. \u201cFrom working to restore America\u2019s standing in the world to bringing crippling sanctions to Iran to negotiating a ceasefire in Gaza, please enjoy all 596 pages of my time as secretary of state.

            "article_content": "Sanders said Tuesday his campaign has received 2.3 million individual contributions \"Obama did very, very well in both 2008 and 2012, but at this particular point, we are doing better,\" Sanders said Bernie Sanders on Tuesday boasted that his campaign, which has proudly eschewed contributions from what the Vermont senator derides as the \u201cbillionaire class,\u201d has received more individual donations up to this point than any other campaign in history, including President Barack Obama\u2019s winning efforts in 2008 and 2012. \u201cWe have received in this campaign 2.3 million individual contributions. Two point three million,\u201d he said to applause at a town hall event here at Buena Vista College. \u201cAnd that comes from a hair less than a million people. Almost a million people making contributions. Now, why is this important? Well number one, it\u2019s important because that\u2019s more contributions that have come into a campaign than any campaign in American history up into this point. So Obama did very, very well in both 2008 and 2012, but at this particular point, we are doing better.\u201d The average contribution, he said, is less than $30. The maximum contribution to a primary campaign allowed under federal law is $2,700, while contributions less than $200 don\u2019t have to be reported with individual\u2019s names. Is Sanders begining to losing momentum? Sanders was citing a statistic circulated by his campaign over the weekend that said Obama\u2019s re-election campaign in 2012 reported 2,209,636 individual contributions through December 31, 2011. CNN is unable to independently confirm the number until January, when the next round of Federal Election Commission reports are filed. Overall, Sanders had raised nearly $40 million through September 30, the most recent period for which FEC filings are available, compared to Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton\u2019s $77 million through that period. Sanders often touts his fundraising figures on the campaign trail in Iowa. At Loras College in Dubuque in August, Sanders said his campaign had received 350,000 individual contributions, with an average contribution of $31.20. At Grinnell College in September, he said had received over 400,000 individual contributions. And at an Iowa City house party in October, he noted he had received more than 650,000 individual contributions. By comparison, at a campaign stop in western Iowa in late October, Sen. Ted Cruz touted over 360,000 individual contributions with an average contribution of $73. \u201cThat is the power of the grassroots,\u201d Cruz said. Sanders is the only Democratic candidate in the race without a super PAC supplementing his fundraising efforts. It\u2019s become such a rallying cry for the Sanders campaign that \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d famously lampooned him about it this fall. Sanders said that with the pace of these contributions, he\u2019s proven the pundits wrong. \u201cWhen we began this campaign, we were told by political pundits and all of the great experts out there, they said, \u2018Bernie, if you want to run a serious national campaign, you have to understand that it requires a whole lot of money. Otherwise it\u2019s really a futile effort. And the only way you can raise all of that money is through a super PAC,\u2019 \u201d he said Tuesday. \u201cWe decided not to do that. I do not represent corporate America, I don\u2019t represent the billionaire class. So we decided we don\u2019t want their money, we\u2019re not going to ask for their money. But then the question was, \u2018Can we turn out enough money to run a serious campaign?\u2019 Well, it turns out we can, and that with an extraordinary outpouring of support from the middle class and working families of this country, we have received 2.3 million individual contributions. And that is just mind-blowing to me.\u201d CNN\u2019s Marshall Cohen contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Bernie Sanders implies Hillary Clinton takes positions based on political expediency Clinton delivers her standard stump speech with a few changes -- including subtle jab at Sanders' electability They spoke at Jefferson-Jackson Dinner, a milestone event in the Iowa Democratic caucus race Bernie Sanders ratcheted up his fire against Hillary Clinton on Saturday night here in Iowa, departing from his normal stump speech to draw repeated contrasts with the former secretary of state. Clinton did not return fire. She delivered her standard stump speech at the Jefferson-Jackson Dinner and chose instead to train her focus on Republicans, not her fellow Democrats. Sanders implied that Clinton took poll-tested positions based on political expediency as he used the milestone event in the Iowa Democratic caucus race to paint himself as a more authentic and faithful fighter for liberal values. He jabbed Clinton on her 2002 Senate vote to authorize the Iraq War and her recently declared opposition to a vast pan-Pacific trade pact she championed as secretary of state, drawing deafening cheers from thousands of his supporters. \u201cI pledge to you that every day I will fight for the public interest, not the corporate interest. I will not abandon any segment of American society \u2013 whether you\u2019re gay or black or Latino or poor, or working class \u2013 just because it is politically expedient at a given time,\u201d he said. In his prepared remarks and in advance excerpts distributed by his campaign, Sanders also said : \u201cI will govern on principle, not poll numbers,\u201d but did not actually voice the line, as he dropped content while rushing to wrap up his speech as his allotted time expired. Clinton subtly framed Sanders as someone more comfortable yelling and complaining than getting things done. \u201cI am running as a proud Democrat,\u201d Clinton proclaimed, a subtle knock against Sanders\u2019 independent status. Clinton stuck to her usual script, delivering a speech aimed at a general election audience, breaking from it only at a few moments. One way she broke: She turned the Obama love up to 11. \u201cI don\u2019t think President Obama gets the credit he deserves for rescuing our economy from falling into a Great Depression,\u201d she said. And the love extended to Vice President Joe Biden, who announced last week he would not enter the 2016 presidential race. \u201cBy his side every step of the way has been Vice President Joe Biden,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cHe has fought passionately for middle-class families and middle-class values. Let\u2019s show him how much we appreciate Vice President Joe Biden and all he has done for our country. Let\u2019s give it up for the vice president.\u201d Later in the speech, Clinton said, \u201cIt\u2019s not enough to just rail against Republicans and billionaires \u2013 we have to win this election.\u201d The comment, a new line for the former first lady, was directed at Sanders\u2019 electability, something Democrats openly worry about. Clinton has been willing to take on Sanders in other venues, but she never does it by using his name. On Saturday, she hit Sanders on gun control, an issue where the senator from Vermont is notably more conservative than many in the Democratic Party. \u201cI have been told to stop shouting about gun violence,\u201d Clinton said, a reference to a comment Sanders made during the first Democratic debate earlier this month. \u201cWell, I haven\u2019t been shouting, but sometimes when a woman speaks, some people think it is shouting. \u2026 I won\u2019t be silenced and I hope (the issue) won\u2019t be, either.\u201d On the whole, however, Sanders was the far more aggressive candidate on Saturday night. Sanders said he was the best Democrat to build a countrywide coalition because he could operate in small groups or before large crowds \u2013 a reference to the big campaign events he has held in sports stadiums that have dwarfed Clinton\u2019s gatherings. Without mentioning Clinton by name, Sanders drew sharp contrasts with the former first lady that were not lost on any of the Democrats in the crowd. He implicitly used Clinton\u2019s Senate vote on Iraq to stir new worries about her hawkishness that helped dent her 2008 campaign for president. \u201cIt gives me no joy to tell you that much of what I predicted about Iraq turned out to be right,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cThat was a tough vote. I came to that fork in the road, and I took the right road even if if was not popular at that time.\u201d He also appeared to take aim at Clinton on same-sex marriage after she said on MSNBC on Friday that the Defense of Marriage Act \u2013 which defined marriage as between a man and a woman and passed during her husband\u2019s administration \u2013 was in fact an attempt to establish a bulwark against conservatives who wanted to roll back gay rights. \u201cToday, some are trying to rewrite history by saying they voted for one anti-gay law to stop something worse. That\u2019s not the case,\u201d Sanders said, half an hour or so before Clinton was due to give her own speech. Sanders then hammered Clinton\u2019s delay in coming out against the proposed Keystone XL Pipeline, designed to bring oil from Canada to the Gulf of Mexico, which environmentalists say will worsen climate change. \u201cIf you agree with me about the urgent need to address climate change, then you would know immediately what to do about the Keystone pipeline. It was not a complicated issue,\u201d Sanders said. On the Trans-Pacific Partnership, Sanders said the deal had never been the \u201cgold standard\u201d of trade pacts, as Clinton had predicted when she ran President Barack Obama\u2019s State Department. \u201cI did not support it yesterday. I do not support it today. And I will not support it tomorrow,\u201d Sanders said. To some Democrats in the room, the harder-edged Sanders was a direct response to the fact Clinton has had a strong October, culminating in her poised appearance at the 11-hour hearing on Benghazi last week. Sanders rejected that idea after the event. \u201cWhat a campaign is about is contrast. That it is what it is about,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cI don\u2019t want negative ads and I don\u2019t believe in negative campaigning, but what is the sense in being in a campaign if you don\u2019t differentiate your difference with your opponents?\u201d",

            "article_content": "Fiorina is expected to surge in the next round of public opinion surveys Fiorina's campaign will have only two weeks to capitalize on Wednesday's performance before filing new numbers with election officials In theory, Carly Fiorina should be one of the best fundraisers in the Republican field. She was the breakout star in CNN\u2019s Republican debate on Wednesday, the second straight contest in which she\u2019s distinguished herself. She\u2019s the former CEO of a major company and she\u2019s well-connected in donor-rich California. But she has a problem: The money hasn\u2019t followed the hype \u2013 yet. \u201cBuzz tends to turn on the money spigot, and she\u2019s clearly getting a lot of buzz out of last night,\u201d said Ken Kies, a longtime Republican bundler and lobbyist. \u201cBut it\u2019s probably not enough to fuel the tank to get you through to February.\u201d Buoyed by two consecutive widely praised debate performances, Fiorina is expected to surge in the next round of public opinion surveys. But party insiders say her next challenge will be to convert that goodwill into hard dollars that can drive votes come next winter. Despite her deep connections to the conservative movement in Washington and to the moneyed class of Silicon Valley, Fiorina\u2019s campaign had only $1 million on hand as of this summer (just slightly more than the same amount as Rick Perry, who has since dropped out of the race due to financial problems.) The former Hewlett-Packard executive took in about $1.7 million in the first two months of her campaign, less than every other Republican candidate she shared the stage with on Wednesday that reported totals. Opinion: Fiorina wins when she stumps Trump And her super PAC, which can collect checks of unlimited size, only hauled in about $3.5 million, a smaller sum all the more harmful given the candidate\u2019s unusual dependence on the outside group. Almost half of that money came from one of the party\u2019s biggest donors, Jerry Perenchio. Fiorina: It's still different for women She\u2019ll face an early test: Fiorina\u2019s campaign will have only two weeks to capitalize on Wednesday\u2019s performance before needing to file new numbers with election officials. But her supporters \u2013 along with top, unaligned GOP fundraisers \u2013 say the narrative is about to change. \u201cMy emails are going crazy today,\u201d said Karolyn Dorsee, who is organizing a San Diego fundraiser for Fiorina but hasn\u2019t committed to help her exclusively. \u201cIf my little world here is any indication, she is on fire.\u201d Her world likely isn\u2019t \u2013 Fiorina\u2019s first reports reveal that she drew heavily from the deep well of California donors, something she may need to broaden to make a serious run for the GOP nomination. But even top moneymen working for other campaigns said they expected the new Republican star to give their fundraising shops a run for their money, predicting that she could post mammoth returns in the final two weeks of what is traditionally a sleepy quarter. There were already immediate signs on Thursday that donors were watching CNN\u2019s debate closely. Stanley Hubbard, a Minnesota billionaire and a top backer of struggling Wisconsin governor Scott Walker, said he planned to give the maximum he could to Fiorina\u2019s campaign, $2,700 (though he said the only super PAC he\u2019d give to would be Walker\u2019s.) \u201cMaybe she\u2019s another Margaret Thatcher. She\u2019s terrific,\u201d said Hubbard, who is also cutting new $2,700 checks to Chris Christie and Marco Rubio. \u201cWe think they\u2019re breakthrough people.\u201d Fiorina distinguishes herself on debate stage Hubbard is part of a network of top-flight donors organized by Charles and David Koch, who surprisingly extended an invitation to Fiorina to address their millionaires as an exclusive conference this summer. That coveted speaking slot gave the Californian a chance to win over some of the biggest GOP whales, who could easily write seven-figure checks to Fiorina\u2019s super PAC. That group has perhaps gone further than any other outside group at taking the place of a traditional campaign. The super PAC, christened CARLY for America, is often times confused in reports with the official operation, Carly for President. The super PAC officials travel with the candidate as she barnstorms the country and helps the businesswoman collect endorsements from early-state officials. But it has struggled to reel in large donations beyond Perenchio, convincing only a handful of Republican donors to give six-figure amounts to the group. (The super PAC supporting Jeb Bush\u2019s bid, for instance, raised 30 times the amount than did Fiorina\u2019s.) The group\u2019s second biggest donation came from a separate super PAC bankrolled by billionaire Republican Bob Mercer, but Mercer is expected to overwhelmingly back Fiorina rival Ted Cruz, whom he originally gifted $11 million. Fiorina loyalists say that Wednesday night\u2019s debate means more big-money backers are en route. \u201cI don\u2019t know if she really has a chance to win, but I like seeing her in these debates,\u201d said Orlando executive Richard Lee, who gave the group $25,000 in April despite originally pledging to not get involved in the primary. \u201cAfter last night, she should probably be able to do better.\u201d Trump throws more barbs about Fiorina\u2019s business record That\u2019s the thinking of many Republican donors, who like Hubbard and Mercer, are supporting Fiorina as a \u201cside bet\u201d in a 16-candidate field. Some of the biggest names in Republican politics appear on Fiorina\u2019s campaign-finance reports, but with small dollar amounts next to her name. They may envision her as a pitbull against the Democratic nominee \u2013 \u201cshe\u2019d eat Hillary Clinton alive,\u201d said Hubbard \u2013 or as a worthwhile investment in the party that has been attacked by Democrats as waging a \u201cwar on women.\u201d Fiorina: I wouldn't change the $10 or $20 bill And while Hubbard\u2019s $2,700 could be a token of more to come, top fundraisers point out that candidate cannot wage a campaign entirely on the back of a super PAC (Perry\u2019s group raised more than $17 million, but his cash strapped campaign lasted 100 days.) Candidates tend to spend months building professional fundraising operations that can systematically collect maximum checks from dozens of their associates, and top bundlers say that doesn\u2019t bloom overnight. \u201cWill people go out of their way to call their friends?\u201d asked David Beightol, a top bundler for Mitt Romney who is now raising money for Bush. \u201cIf she has those tools in place, she could do really well. If she doesn\u2019t, she might get a lot of little donors \u2014 and that won\u2019t hurt \u2014 but to make a difference she\u2019s going to have some big donors too.\u201d Fiorina friends say she is fine being underestimated as a fundraiser \u2013 arguing that both of the past two debates are evidence that she\u2019ll beat expectations. \u201cShe believed that at first, no one would take her seriously. Then, that she\u2019s nice to have there,\u201d said super PAC donor Phil Lebherz, an ally from California. Lebherz said she\u2019s now taking the third step: \u201cAnd then she\u2019s a threat.\u201d Trump cites \u2018double standard\u2019 in comments about Fiorina\u2019s appearance",

The Wisconsin governor appeared in Las Vegas for a campaign town hall where he announced his labor policies. The proposals largely resembled the policies he pushed through as governor of Wisconsin, the fight over which made him a national figure and resulted in his being recalled \u2013 an election he won handily. \u201cJust like President Reagan, I believe we need to drain the swamp in Washington, D.C.,\u201d Walker said Monday. \u201cI have a plan to check the power of the big-government union bosses, empower individuals and protect taxpayers.\u201d Scott Walker's career RELATED: Walker hits Obama on police shootings Walker\u2019s proposals include repealing the Obama administration\u2019s labor regulations, requiring union expenditure reporting, cracking down on government unions to prevent them from collecting dues from federal employees, and getting rid of the National Labor Relations Board. The plan also featured Walker\u2019s centerpiece issue of right-to-work legislation, which prevents union membership from being a condition of employment. \u201cOur plan will eliminate the big government unions entirely and put the American people back in charge of their government,\u201d Walker said. \u201cFederal employees should work for the taxpayers - not the other way around.\u201d Unions and labor groups are a powerful force in politics, in recent years mainly for Democrats, and they targeted firepower against Walker in Wisconsin.

Martin O\u2019Malley responded to Walker\u2019s tweets about his plan, making similar criticisms. .@ScottWalker No. This would hurt families across America.

            "article_content": "Sen. Bernie Sanders says billionaire \"oligarchs\" have hijacked America's economy and inflicted misery on the middle class His fiery brand of politics has netted him a 75% approval rating in Vermont, but how will the rest of America receive him? It wouldn\u2019t be the first time a revolution sparked in New England changed the world. But two and a half centuries after the insurrection that birthed America, the idea that a rumpled radical like 73-year-old Vermont socialist Bernie Sanders could overthrow the U.S. economic, health care and tax systems seems farfetched at best. Yet that\u2019s exactly the task the fiery U.S. senator has set himself in a presidential campaign targeting billionaire \u201coligarchs\u201d who he says have hijacked America\u2019s economy and inflicted misery on the middle class. Sanders, an agitator who doesn\u2019t suffer fools, political opponents or journalists gladly, is testing whether the kind of populist, liberal agenda that gave him 75% approval ratings in his adopted home state can catch fire nationwide. READ: Bernie Sanders\u2019 brotherly love \u201cBrothers and sisters: Now is not the time for thinking small,\u201d Sanders told thousands of supporters in Burlington on Tuesday. \u201cNow is not the time for the same-old, same-old establishment politics and stale inside-the-Beltway ideas,\u201d Sanders said in an implicit denunciation of the runaway front-runner for the Democratic nomination, Hillary Clinton. The obstacles Sanders faces in the presidential primary race, however, are immense. Sanders has no viable countrywide political organization, so he must foment a grassroots uprising. His task is complicated by the fact that although he caucuses with the Democrats in the Senate, he has always been a political independent wary of formal party affiliations. He must take on the Clinton political machine that has retooled after its defeat in 2008. He\u2019s a minnow in the money game in a campaign that will be awash in billions of dollars. He\u2019s not exactly a polished pol either, with an unrepentant message of class warfare that makes him an unlikely candidate to win over Middle America. And many Democrats are only beginning to learn who Sanders actually is. He\u2019s a long shot, but has shown some momentum since indicating he would take the plunge into the presidential race late last month. In a new Quinnipiac University poll released on Thursday, Sanders was at 15% of Democratic voters nationwide, up from the 5% he managed in a CNN national poll last month. His campaign launch, on a Lake Champlain boardwalk that he saved from developers as Burlington\u2019s mayor, had the air of a hippie revival or a folk festival. One woman twirled a hula hoop and shouted \u201cHooping for Bernie\u201d; people lined up for free helpings of locally made Ben and Jerry\u2019s ice cream; and kids carried banners naming Sanders their political superhero. Vermont-based warm-up act Mango Jam pumped out a fusion of Zydeco, Cajun and Caribbean rhythms. Bernie Sanders' brother is also running for office The place pulsed with the hopeful political energy that is unique to the start of U.S. presidential campaigns when anything seems possible \u2013 even in minute, ultraliberal blue states with three electoral votes. Of course, in the highly unlikely scenario that Sanders is elected president, enacting his revolutionary agenda faces even greater odds. Another long-shot, transformational president has already demonstrated how hard turning campaign slogans into reality can be. If there\u2019s one lesson of Barack Obama\u2019s White House, it\u2019s that passing social reforms such as Obamacare \u2013 which falls way short of the kind of single-payer health system Sanders prefers \u2013 can be almost impossible and exact a heavy political price. Sanders surely knows this. He might be a dreamer, but he knows the realities of politics: A pragmatic streak leavened his idealism during four terms as mayor; he railed against the Iraq war but became a champion of veterans in the Senate. So it may be fair to question whether, unlike his devoted Vermont cadres, a politician as experienced as Sanders thinks he can actually win the presidency, especially as political reality is weighted against him. America\u2019s middle class, while hurting, is hardly a simmering proletariat ready for the economic shock therapy he prescribes. And political opponents argue that for all his flamboyance, Vermont has not done that well in the Sanders era. \u201cFear and frustration are a powerful political cocktail,\u201d said a statement from the Vermont Republican Party on Tuesday. \u201cAll you have to do is take a good look at Vermont\u2019s demographic and economic realities \u2013 and our growing crisis of affordability \u2013 to get a good look at what the hangover from a Sanders administration would look and feel like.\u201d But to simply write off the Sanders campaign as some kind of personal vanity project, or a token quest to insert progressive values into the 2016 campaign, does him an injustice. His messages, the timing of his campaign, the polls and his personal qualities suggest that the Sanders campaign could end up more than a flight of political fancy and become a real headache for the Clinton machine. For starters, the 2016 Democratic primary campaign seems to be shaping itself around the issues of economic justice and fairness for which he first fought amid the political turmoil of 1960s Chicago where he was a student. READ: Bernie Sanders takes aim at Wall Street in presidential launch In a recent interview with CNN, the candidate\u2019s UK-based brother Larry disputed the notion that Sanders is a man of the fringe. \u201cI don\u2019t think we are out of the mainstream. I think that what we have noticed is that the mainstream has been ignored for a long time,\u201d he said. While the solutions that Bernie Sanders advocates to fix America\u2019s problems are radical, his diagnosis of the national mood is not. Health care, child care, college and medical costs preoccupy middle class families, whomever they vote for, a fact reflected in the way Clinton and Republicans Marco Rubio, Jeb Bush and Rick Santorum have emphasized income inequality in their campaigns. One advantage Sanders may have over this crowd is the crucial elixir of presidential runs \u2013 \u201cauthenticity\u201d \u2013 said Vermont University political science professor Garrison Nelson, who has known Sanders for decades. \u201cBernie Sanders has been saying these same things for over 40 years. Bernie is not tailoring his speeches to the agenda. The agenda has caught up with Bernie Sanders.\u201d Another way Sanders debunks the hopeless crusade metaphor is that he\u2019s not just some political gadfly. He narrowly won his first race for mayor, then got elected over and over again, and has been in Congress for a quarter century. But it\u2019s not a given that his brusque style and pyrotechnical calls for a revolution will go down well in Iowa, for instance, where voters like to be wooed rather than harangued. \u201cIt is going to be a hard sell,\u201d said Nelson, who said his friend must find a sweet spot on the issue of income inequality. \u201cBernie is counting on that \u2013 that degree of resentment and that degree of anger.\u201d While Sanders is a novelty in Iowa, he\u2019s a known commodity in New Hampshire \u2013 where the overlap from the Burlington media market makes him well-known and could give him a leg up in the primary campaign. But Sanders must also show that he has got the financial muscle to even get that far \u2013 though he says he is certain he can raise $50 million, after quickly pulling in contributions of around $4 million within days of first saying he would run for president. \u201cThat should give him enough money to be competitive in the four early states,\u201d said Eric Davis, a veteran Vermont political analyst and professor emeritus at Middlebury College, referring to Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina and Nevada. READ: Windfall at Bernie\u2019s: Sanders raises $1.5 million in 24 hour But Davis asked: \u201cWhat state is his campaign going to be in at the end of those four early contests?\u201d And if by some miracle he won the nomination, he would then find it difficult to counter questions about whether his left-wing politics would be palatable to a wider electorate. Still, polls suggest that Sanders is a viable candidate to be the leading alternative to Clinton among Democrats \u2013 though he lags behind the former first lady by 50%. A Quinnipiac University poll in Iowa found that 15% of likely caucus goers would back him while 18% of likely Democratic voters in New Hampshire prefer him \u2013 numbers that give him a genuine platform in the race. He\u2019s ahead of other possible Democratic long shots, including former Maryland Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley and former Sen. Jim Webb of Virginia. And while he may not beat Clinton, Sanders can at least shape the economic debate in the Democratic primary and force her to confront her liabilities on trade and the influence of big money in politics. Clinton will also be wary of alienating liberal Democrats who support Sanders and are suspicious of her candidacy, but whom she needs to swell her margins in Midwestern swing states if she is to win the general election. Sanders\u2019 hopes of causing a stir in 2016 also depend on his capacity to show the side of his character that has won him such a loyal following in Vermont, where he has convinced voters he is on their side. Ann Taylor of Burlington, a self described \u201cold hippie,\u201d said Sanders was pushing a message that America needed to hear: \u201cThis is probably the only candidate that is going to fight for working people. And I know he is influencing Sen. Clinton. Bernie will do so much for working people, it is unbelievable.\u201d It\u2019s rare to find a lawmaker or leader who is as beloved on his home turf as Sanders. The key to his popularity may lie to some extent in Vermont\u2019s compact geography and a population that is much smaller than that of many American cities. He will have a harder time making personal connections in a presidential race. So the fate of the Sanders campaign likely lies in whether the rest of America, and not just liberal Vermont, is hankering for a liberal class warrior who shoots from the lip.",

            "article_content": "Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders formally jumped into the Democratic primary race Tuesday. The self-described \"Democratic socialist\" launched a campaign critical of the power of Wall Street. Bernie Sanders is not just running for president \u2013 he\u2019s promising a \u201crevolution.\u201d The firebrand Vermont Senator vowed Tuesday to wrest back America from the hands of billionaires, formally launching a populist grass roots White House bid that threatens to tug Democratic frontrunner Hillary Clinton towards the liberal left. \u201cThe gap between the very rich and everyone is wider than at any time since the 1920s. The issue of wealth and income inequality is the great moral issue of our time, it is the great economic issue of our time and it is the great political issue of our time, Sanders roared, before thousands of supporters in Burlington, the liberal city he once served as mayor. \u2018Enough is enough,\u201d Sanders said, warning he was putting the \u201ctop 1%\u201d \u2013 the biggest beneficiaries of what he says is an immoral economy skewed against the poor, on notice. Bernie Sanders' path to victory RELATED: Sanders says Clinton\u2019s wealth is \u2018a problem\u2019 \u201cTo the billionare class I say your greed has got to end,\u201d he said. \u201cThis great nation and its government belong to all of the people and not to a handful of billionaires, their super PACs and their lobbyists,\u201d Sanders said, his rasping voice echoing across a placid Lake Champlain, with the Adirondacks etched on the horizon. Sanders, who trails Clinton in most polls by around 50%, is the longest of long-shot candidates as his politics sits well to the left of the mainstream of the Democratic Party, let alone most of the rest of American voters. But despite that, polls show that assuming Vice President Joe Biden, and liberal favorite Elizabeth Warren don\u2019t take Clinton on, Sanders is now currently the best-placed Democrat to serve as an alternative to the former secretary of state. And even if he is not able to threaten Clinton\u2019s dominance, he may help shape the contours of the Democratic race for president and possibly pull Clinton away from the political center ground that she prefers to occupy. Sanders did not mention the former secretary of state by name, but much of his speech seemed a veiled argument that he, and not Clinton, after more than two decades in the rarefied air at the top  of U.S. politics, understands the plight of the working and middle classes. \u201cToday \u2026 we begin a political revolution to transform our country economically, politically, socially and environmentally,\u201d Sanders told a crowd, cooled in the hot sun by free helpings of ice cream from \u201cBen and Jerry\u2019s,\u201d an iconic local brand. Bernie Sanders' brother is also running for office RELATED: Clinton\u2019s super PAC fundraising irks progressives \u201cEnough is enough. This great nation and its government belong to all of the people and not to a handful of billionaires, their super PACs and their lobbyists,\u201d he said. Specifically, Sanders promised to spend $1 trillion to create 13 million jobs in a massive infrastructure program, to double the minimum wage to $15 an hour, to end the \u201cgreed\u201d of the \u201cbillionaire class\u201d by raising taxes for the wealthy and to break up the largest financial institutions in the country. In a progressive, government-led program that would indeed represent a revolution if it was ever passed, Sanders promised a single-payer state health care system, free college tuition at colleges and universities and to reverse climate change. The Brooklyn-born Sanders denies he is a political outlier at the fringes of mainstream politics. Instead, he accuses his fellow politicians and the media of ignoring the reality that the wealthy are doing better than ever in the wake of the worst recession in 80 years while many in the middle class are still struggling. Since he confirmed on April 30 that he would launch a presidential run, Sanders, 73, has enjoyed a boost in the polls in the key early states. A Quinnipiac University polls in Iowa found that 15% of likely caucus goers would back him while 18% of likely Democratic voters in New Hampshire backed his campaign. Clinton however dominated the surveys, with 60% and 62% ratings in the two polls, respectively. However, while he lags behind Clinton, Sanders, for now, is ahead of other possible Democratic long-shot candidates, including former Maryland Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley, who is set to make an announcement on his intentions at the weekend and former Virginia Sen. Jim Webb. The polls reflect the fact that many Democrats privately believe that Clinton is the best chance they have to hang on to the White House, and the former secretary of state is an even more prohibitive frontrunner than before she lost to Barack Obama in the 2008 Democratic primary race. But Sanders, a rumpled and sometimes grumpy figure, who prides his independence and who has spent decades questioning the power of corporate barons on Wall Street may at least have the issues on his side. The theme of income inequality is dominating the economic argument in the nascent 2016 campaign \u2013 not just among Democrats, but it is also beginning to feature in the rhetoric of top Republican hopefuls, including Jeb Bush and Marco Rubio. Sanders hopes of mounting a credible campaign may rest on whether he can corral support from liberal Democrats who are pining for a run from another populist economic crusader Warren, who insists she is taking a pass on the race despite wildfire support among the party\u2019s grass roots. In many ways, Sanders is an anti-politician. Despite serving as mayor of Burlington for four terms and winning seats in the House of Representatives and the Senate, he glorifies in being an outsider, and with his wild white hair and brusque manner lacks the polish of most Washington politicians \u2013 and presidential candidates. Sanders will be especially closely watched for the way he handles Clinton and could pose perhaps the most risk for the former first lady on the debate stage, where he can be a tenacious advocate for his policy positions. But he insisted that the election was not about personality clashes. \u201cThis campaign is not about Bernie Sanders. It is not about Hillary Clinton. It is not about Jeb Bush or anyone else. This campaign is about the needs of the American people,\u201d he said. But Clinton will be mindful of the fact that the first signs of vulnerability in her 2008 Democratic primary campaign came when she tripped up in an exchange with another long-shot contender, then Sen. Christopher Dodd. One area where Sanders could make things dicey for Clinton is over the vast Trans-Pacific Partnership Trade pact which is at the centerpiece of Obama\u2019s foreign policy. Sanders and many liberal Democrats oppose the deal because they believe it will accelerate the loss of U.S. jobs to low wage economies overseas. Clinton has yet to say whether she is for or against the proposed deal. Sanders also had sharp words for the media, arguing that it often obsessed on trivialities and character issues, rather than the policies Americans cared about. \u201cPolitics in a democratic society should not be treated like a baseball game, a game show or a soap opera. The times are too serious for that,\u201d he said.",

            "article_content": "Hillary Clinton\u2019s decision to personally raise money for a super PAC supporting her campaign is agitating her progressive critics, who see the move as further proof that the Democratic presidential frontrunner doesn\u2019t share some of their values. There was never any expectation that Clinton would renounce super PAC money this election cycle. But liberal activists determined to use the Democratic primary to pressure Clinton to embrace a progressive agenda say the idea of the former secretary of state personally wooing the wealthiest class of donors runs counter to the populist rhetoric she\u2019s employed this year. Within days of announcing her White House bid, Clinton had called out wealthy investors for paying too little in taxes and pledged to get big money out of politics. At the time, it was a welcome message for liberal Democrats who are uncomfortable with Clinton\u2019s close ties to Wall Street and find the prominent role of super PACs in elections utterly distasteful. But the recent revelation that Clinton will personally fundraise for a super PAC supporting her campaign \u2013 a decision to play by the rules of a system she has condemned as \u201cdysfunctional\u201d \u2013 has invited fresh eye-rolling. It has also exposed a core tension for Democrats, who have increasingly embraced super PACs at the same time that they decry the explosion of soft money in national politics. RELATED: Hillary Clinton\u2019s Achilles\u2019 heel? Clinton\u2019s campaign is explaining the decision as a matter of political necessity. \u201cWith some Republican candidates reportedly setting up and outsourcing their entire campaign to super PACs and the Koch Brothers pledging $1 billion alone for the 2016 campaign, Democrats have to have the resources to fight back,\u201d a Clinton campaign official said in an email, who spoke anonymously to discuss the sensitive topic of fundraising. \u201cThere is too much at stake for our future for Democrats to unilaterally disarm.\u201d Clinton\u2019s expected involvement with Priorities USA has highlighted the contrast between her and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, an independent who is Clinton\u2019s only declared rival to date for the Democratic presidential nomination, as well as other potential challengers. An independent from Vermont seeking the Democratic presidential nomination, Sanders has aggressively opposed super PAC donations. A long-shot candidate without a national fundraising operation, Sanders has no chance of matching Clinton\u2019s fundraising haul and has little to lose by going after millionaire and billionaire donors. On Capitol Hill last week, Sanders told CNN that Clinton\u2019s decision to personally court super PAC donors was \u201cunfortunate.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re living in a world since Citizens United where multi-millionaires and billionaires are playing a horrendous role in the political system,\u201d Sanders said, referring to the Supreme Court\u2019s 2010 ruling that paved the way for super PACs to direct virtually uncapped amounts of money to aid political candidates. \u201cThat\u2019s why I believe that we need to overturn Citizens United and move to public funding of elections.\u201d Hillary Clinton's team Phil Noble, a South Carolina Democratic activist and supporter of former Maryland Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley, a potential Democratic candidate for president, said the development underscores what progressives view as a \u201cfundamental disconnect\u201d between Clinton and middle class voters. \u201cIt\u2019s not that she raises a bunch of money for a PAC that causes her problems with middle class voters. That is a symptom as opposed to the ailment,\u201d Noble said. \u201cThe larger illness is she is out of touch with middle class voters \u2013 she does have a lifestyle and a history that is about as alien to middle class voters as corporate jets are to a Subaru.\u201d And activists who are pushing Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren to challenge Clinton see campaign finance reform as a major issue. \u201cBeing a true champion for working families like Elizabeth Warren is about clearly and unequivocally supporting such critical priorities as a constitutional amendment overturning Citizens United,\u201d said Erica Sagrans, campaign manager for Ready for Warren, a movement dedicated to drafting Sen. Elizabeth Warren into the 2016 race. Clinton\u2019s personal involvement with Priorities USA marks the latest chapter in the Democratic Party\u2019s evolving relationship with super PACs. Democrats initially fiercely opposed Citizens United. But for all of their rhetoric against super PACs, and as much as the party continues to use the Supreme Court decision as a political rallying cry, over the years political interest has largely won out over progressive idealism. In 2012, President Barack Obama reversed course, declaring after years of keeping his distance from super PACs that his campaign would participate in raising money for Priorities USA. Now that tension is being brought to new heights as the party\u2019s next likely presidential nominee personally plans to drum up support for a super PAC backing her candidacy. RELATED: Bush and Clinton confront family legacies Clinton allies also see that her fundraising prowess and the depth of her connections with the kinds of donors who can cut multi-million dollar checks will likely make her a formidable competitor against any Republican candidate she may face in the general election. Officials are careful to emphasize, however, that Clinton and everyone else involved with her campaign will strictly follow the law as they solicit funds for Priorities USA. The 2016 money race is well underway on the other side of the political aisle. Declared GOP candidates including Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas and Marco Rubio of Florida, as well as expected candidates like former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, are on a fundraising tear. And they\u2019ve shown no signs of distancing themselves from super PAC money. Cruz launched his campaign in March, and the senator\u2019s allies declared that an affiliated network of pro-Cruz super PACs had raised upwards of $30 million in just a matter of days. The stiff competition against Republican money is a reality that some progressive leaders say they cannot ignore. Former Vermont governor and Democratic National Committee Chairman Howard Dean said it would be unwise for Clinton to reject super PAC money. \u201cUnfortunately, if you don\u2019t play by the same rules everybody else does, you end up losing elections,\u201d said Dean, founder of Democracy for America, one of the groups behind the draft Warren movement. \u201cThe key is to change the rules, and I think we have a much better chance of doing that with her as president than we do with one of the Republicans.\u201d",

            "article_content": "No one, probably not even David Cameron himself, thought it would end like this. The British Prime Minister\u2019s stunning election victory on Thursday defied pollsters and pundits predicting a fraught new age of fragile coalition governments and lurching political instability in London. His triumph was so total and so unexpected that three rival party leaders had fallen on their swords by lunchtime Friday and polling companies had launched a probe on what went wrong. READ: Great Scot! How Nicola Sturgeon is realigning British politics Britain\u2019s global partners, meanwhile, breathed sighs of relief that Cameron\u2019s victory, and slim parliamentary majority of 12 seats, averted political chaos in London that could have further eroded Britain\u2019s already diminished global standing. Still, once the celebrations die down, Cameron will face immense challenges over E.U. membership and what to do about a rebellious Scotland that will dictate the place Britain, with whom America has a \u201cspecial relationship,\u201d will occupy on the world stage. And the outcome of those struggles could raise questions about Britain\u2019s international leadership. In the short term, Cameron\u2019s capture of an outright majority for his second term enhances his stature among fellow world leaders and offers a chance to redefine a reputation of being someone stronger on slick presentation than substance and who is not yet known as a dominant leader with a clear sense of direction. His liberation from his centrist coalition partner the Liberal Democrats \u2013 who always clipped his wings \u2013 will also allow him to dole out more government posts as patronage to keep his own troops in line. \u201cThere is some potential for some form of leadership or some form of policy coherence going forward,\u201d said Nicholas Dungan, a senior fellow at the Atlantic Council. \u201cThe trouble is that policy coherence may be something very new from David Cameron. We haven\u2019t had much or it in the last five years \u2013 there is a big question about his political maturity.\u201d Cameron looked suitably jubilant \u2013 and a little smug \u2013 as he walked up Downing Street with his wife Samantha on Friday morning after his surprise election win. But he must quickly get to work on two huge, even existential, challenges for the United Kingdom, that the election has only made more acute: Scotland and the EU. He\u2019ll face a constant battle to ensure that the U.K. political class does not become inward-looking and consumed with Britain\u2019s survival as a unified state or the potentially explosive debate over Europe. Cameron has promised to renegotiate the terms of Britain\u2019s membership with the EU, to mollify many Britons who believe that too much sovereignty has ebbed away to Brussels. After that, he has pledged to hold a referendum by 2017 on whether to leave the bloc. The outcome of that vote is hard to predict. READ: Why Americans should care about the UK vote \u201cWe will now face five years where questions will arise about the future of our union, about whether or not we can stay as a member of the EU,\u201d Ed Balls, the Labour Party\u2019s finance spokesman, who lost his seat in parliament, told CNN affiliate ITN. Sir Martin Sorrell, CEO of WPP PLC, one of Britain\u2019s leading businessmen, told CNN that the Conservative Party\u2019s victory, which was welcomed by the markets, was a good sign for businesses big and small. But he cautioned that the focus turned to the EU referendum \u201cthe moment those exit polls came out last night.\u201d Though Cameron doesn\u2019t have to worry about keeping coalition partners in line any more \u2013 the Liberal Democrats were almost wiped out by the election \u2013 his political problems are by no means over. Cameron will likely spend considerable political energy trying to keep the troublesome Euro-skeptic wing of his Conservative Party in check. He will try to avoid the fate of former Conservative premier John Major 1992, who saw the promise of his own surprise election win shattered by fighting about Europe among troublesome party lawmakers he later branded \u201cbastards.\u201d \u201cIn some ways, (Cameron) was protected by the Lib Dems as the leader of a coalition government. It protected him from the right wing of his party,\u201d Mike Finn, professor of history at Liverpool Hope University, told CNN. \u201cHe is going to have to face up to some of his demands from his right that previously he has not had to accede to.\u201d Cameron received some good news early Friday when Nigel Farage, the leader of the anti-Europe UK Independence Party, lost his bid for a seat in Parliament. Farage would have been a troublesome presence for Cameron from a perch on the opposition benches and would have delighted in poking at Conservative divisions over Europe. Despite winning 3 million votes, in a barometer of Euro skepticism, UKIP only ended up with one of Parliament\u2019s 650 seats. The United States in particular has made no secret of its desire to see its long-time \u201cspecial relationship\u201d ally remain a united nation and inside the European Union, believing such a position best preserves its strength and international influence. \u201cThe biggest issue really is Europe, and what my American friends and former colleagues tell me is that there is great concern in Washington about a Britain which is leaving Europe, which may be putting that vital part of our destiny in doubt,\u201d Sir Nigel Sheinwald, former UK ambassador to the United States, told CNN. UK party leaders In an interview with CNN\u2019s Christiane Amanpour ahead of the election, former President Bill Clinton said: \u201cI would rather have them fighting within a United Kingdom, I would rather have them fighting within an EU.\u201d He explained, \u201cThe rest of Europe needs the financial strength of the UK and the economic growth.\u201d But many analysts believe that European leaders are unlikely to offer the kind of concessions on the free movement of people, budgets and other issues that Cameron is seeking to satisfy the British public and maintain their support for the EU - even given his enhanced political authority. There has also been deep concern in the United States about Britain\u2019s global posture in recent years. Austerity policies pursued by Cameron\u2019s government have meant curtailing some of Britain\u2019s military capabilities, and there are fears that London\u2019s defense spending could fall below the 2% of GDP threshold required of NATO members. Washington has turned to another ally, France, to partner on military operations against Al-Qaeda and other groups in Africa. France and Germany have also been the White House\u2019s main points of contact on the showdown with Russia over Ukraine. There is a clear recognition in Washington that German Chancellor Angela Merkel rather than Cameron is the most important leader in Europe. And it did not go unnoticed in the Obama administration that the British parliament\u2019s vote against military action in Syria in 2013 helped derail Obama\u2019s own push for action against the Assad regime\u2019s use of chemical weapons. \u201cThe UK has fallen off the world stage,\u201d one Obama administration official commented privately recently. READ: Why British politics are even more dysfunctional than America\u2019s Cameron\u2019s other big problem is Scotland. \u201cThe Scottish lion has roared,\u201d said veteran Scottish National Party power broker Alex Salmond, who is returning to Westminster after his party\u2019s landslide and eradication of the Labour Party in its one-time stronghold, to fight Scotland\u2019s corner in the UK parliament. SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon repeatedly said that the election, which saw her party pick up 56 of Scotland\u2019s 59 seats was not about independence following the referendum vote against breaking away from the rest of the U.K. last year. That strategy helped Sturgeon pick up support even from people who voted \u201cno\u201d in the referendum. But the size of the SNP victory \u2013 and that fact that the election also ushers in five more years of Conservative rule in London will inevitably \u2013 fuel more talk of independence votes. If Sturgeon\u2019s party repeats its performance in elections to Scotland\u2019s parliament in 2016, that momentum may become unstoppable. Sturgeon, who emerged as an undisputed star of the election campaign, also faces political challenges. For starters, she must ensure that she does not alienate people who turned to the SNP in the general election who may be put off by a swift pivot towards another referendum. While the SNP will have symbolic power thanks to the size of its Scottish landslide on Thursday, it will still be confined to the opposition benches in the UK parliament and will have no real power to change Scotland\u2019s relations with the national government. Its main focus now will be in ensuring that the UK government lives up to promises of further devolution of powers to Scotland that were made in the aftermath of last year\u2019s referendum. Cameron quickly moved to make clear he understood the implications of the triumph by SNP. \u201cI want to bring our country together, our United Kingdom, together, not least by implementing as fast as we can the devolution that we rightly promised and came together with other parties to agree both for Wales and for Scotland,\u201d he said. But the sheer incongruence of the Conservatives, who are reviled in much of Scotland, and the SNP, which demonized the Tories on the campaign trail, working together will be an enormous test of the skills of both Cameron and Sturgeon. So, as Cameron settles back into Number 10 Downing Street, he knows that the years ahead of him are deeply consequential. His task is to save the ancient union and to navigate a treacherous political relationship with Europe. How he responds will also dictate whether Britain remains America\u2019s most valued foreign ally.",

            "article_content": "20-year-old Mhairi Black of the Scottish National Party wins Labour seat from Douglas Alexander Election will make her the youngest British member of Parliament since 1667 Black's candidacy was marred by a series of offensive tweets and remarks Mhairi Black, the freshly elected lawmaker from Scotland, will soon be heading down from her constituency of Paisley and Renfrewshire South to Westminster. But she has an immediate challenge ahead of her: getting her university degree. Black is all of 20 years old. And Friday, she made history by becoming the youngest lawmaker in UK history since the 17th century. Here\u2019s what you need to know about the Scot who came from behind and shook the political landscape. As member of the Scottish Nationalist Party (the SNP), she went up against Douglas Alexander, a long-time Labour Party heavy-hitter. He  is a former Cabinet minister and such a shrewd veteran of political campaigns that he was Labour\u2019s campaign chief. He is also a member of the shadow cabinet \u2013 the group of politicians from the opposition party who would head up ministries if in power. If he had been elected, and had Labour come to power, he would have become the new foreign secretary, a position similar to the Secretary of State in the U.S. But in the end, her 23,548 votes outstripped her opponent \u2013 Alexander ended the night with 17,864 votes \u2013 overturning the veteran\u2019s huge majority from the 2010 general election. Alexander has represented the area since 1997, and today marks the first time for 70 years that the constituency has not been a Labour seat. In 1667, after being \u201creturned as knight of the shire,\u201d Christopher Monck took his place in Parliament when he was just 13. Sure, there have been other young parliamentarians, but none as young as Black \u2013 in the last 350 years. Most recently, former Liberal Democrat leader Charles Kennedy was elected into Westminster at the tender age of 23. But he was three years older than Black is now. Thank you to everyone who turned out and voted for me and helping me win the Paisley and Renfrewshire South #voteSnP pic.twitter.com/nZqyO7C85G Black grew up in Paisley, a working class town in the west of Scotland. From a young age, she would march for causes as diverse as support for a Scottish parliament and opposition to the Iraq war. She was a vocal supporter of Scottish independence during last year\u2019s referendum campaign. She says that she \u201cwitnessed first hand the level of poverty and injustice prevalent in our society,\u201d touring some of the country\u2019s most deprived areas. The referendum campaign failed, but a passionate, fiery and intelligent campaigner was born. \u201cOver the two years of that referendum campaign it was a political awakening,\u201d she told CNN\u2019s Phil Black. \u201cIt forced people to engage and think about arguments and try and articulate arguments and look for quality.\u201d A season ticket holder and lifelong fan of her local football club, Partick Thistle, Black has occasionally let her soccer tribalism get the better of her. During one match against perennial Scottish champions Celtic in October 2013, she tweeted: \u201cI\u2019ve only just realised \u2013 I really f***** hate Celtic\u201d and \u201cCeltic, yer a joke! #scum.\u201d And like many other Scottish students she\u2019s also used social media to boast about her drinking. She tweeted her love of Smirnoff Ice, calling it the \u201cnectar of the gods.\u201d She also tweeted about waking up next to a can of beer and a pizza, calling it \u201ca success.\u201d Like a novice, the tweets remained undeleted until after her selection \u2013 at least until the media managed to get hold of screen grabs. The SNP defended her selection as a candidate, saying, \u201cMhairi is a dedicated young woman who learned a great deal during the referendum, and wants to do her best for her community as its MP.\u201d These slip-ups, along with a speech where she seemed to suggest a desire to physically assault opponents to the referendum, threatened to derail her freshman campaign. After the referendum result had come in, she told a pro-independence rally that her political opponents\u2019 apparently insincere commiserations had made her want to put \u201cthe nut on\u201d \u2013 head-butt \u2013 them. She also called unionists \u201cselfish\u201d and \u201cgullible.\u201d Comments like these put pressure on SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon to deselect her as a candidate. Sturgeon stood by her woman, and Black has since adopted a much more humble approach. She says that she has learned her lesson, telling Scottish tabloid newspaper the Daily Record, \u201cIt\u2019s not a figure of speech I will use again. And as far as my remarks about No voters are concerned, I realised myself before the referendum that it was wrong to talk in these terms - I learned and I changed my language. \u201cIf elected, I will be proud to represent all the people of Paisley and Renfrewshire South.\u201d She\u2019s a final-year student of Politics and Public Policy at the University of Glasgow. In order to graduate \u2013 and take on her first graduate job in the House of Commons \u2013 she has to finish her dissertation. It\u2019s due at the end of the month. But what\u2019ll she do first, a reporter asked her Thursday night? \u201cSleep,\u201d she replied. And then? \u201cBreakfast.\u201d",

Mike Huckabee defended renting out his email list to a group selling hidden cures for cancer embedded in Bible verses, saying it was no different than CNN allowing advertisers for catheters or adult diapers to air alongside programming. \u201cMy gosh, that\u2019s like saying, \u2018You run some ads on CNN. Do you personally agree with all the ads that run on CNN?\u2019 Huckabee said Wednesday to CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper on The Lead. Political panel: How well positioned is Huckabee? READ: Election 2016: Who are the richest candidates? \u201cI doubt you do. I\u2019m sure there are some for maybe, I don\u2019t know, catheters or adult diapers. They\u2019re not products that you use or that you necessarily believe in,\u201d the 2016 Republican presidential candidate said. \u201cI don\u2019t hold you responsible for that, and in that same way I don\u2019t think that people that understand how advertising works would hold me responsible for something that I didn\u2019t personally sign up for or endorse.\u201d Huckabee, who won the Iowa caucuses during his first presidential bid in 2008, explained he couldn\u2019t dictate how people decided to use his large email list. \u201cI didn\u2019t actually control that part of our company,\u201d he said. In 2008, Huckabee showed the ability to win over the Hawkeye State\u2019s social conservative base but little ability to move beyond that and win over more business-minded voters. He pledged his coalition this year would draw on more working-class voters who harbor deep antipathy for Washington. Huckabee, who has drawn fire for saying that the Supreme Court could not overrule the law of God, defended himself Wednesday with Tapper. When asked what he would do if the high court effectively legalized same-sex marriage, which the former Baptist preacher opposes, Huckabee said states should decide how to move forward. \u201cWell, I think states have to decide, do they follow through with legislation and create a law? The Supreme Court can\u2019t create a law,\u201d Huckabee said. \u201cThey can invalidate one, but even then the legislative body and the executive branch has to enable legislation, executives have to sign it, they have to enforce it. The courts can\u2019t do that.\u201d If the court could unilaterally decide whether to overrule the other two branches, Huckabee said, \u201cthen we have turned the court into this super branch of government.\u201d It was not immediately clear what Huckabee meant, though CNN has reached out to Huckabee\u2019s campaign for clarification. The Supreme Court ruling would be based on the Constitution, which Congress does have the power to amend but requires a two-thirds majority to approve.",

            "article_content": "Presidential contender Bernie Sanders insisted Wednesday that he isn\u2019t running \u201cagainst Hillary Clinton,\u201d but drew on the ongoing fight over a major trade deal to distinguish himself from his opponent for the Democratic nomination. Sanders, a senator from Vermont, pointed out his role in \u201chelping to lead\u201d the fight against the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal, known as TPP, and urged voters to \u201clook at the record\u201d \u2013 a record that shows Clinton advocated for TPP during her time as Secretary of State. \u201cI have voted against every disastrous trade agreement coming down the pike and helping to lead the effort against this Trans-Pacific Partnership, which would mean the outsourcing of more good paying job to low-wage countries,\u201d Sanders said Wednesday on CNN\u2019s \u201cNew Day.\u201d \u201cPeople have got to look at Secretary Clinton\u2019s record,\u201d Sanders added. Sanders launched his campaign for president last week, one that will build on grassroots support. RELATED: Bernie Sanders challenges Hillary Clinton\u2019s trade record In the first 24 hours after he announced, Sanders raised $1.5 million from 35,000 contributors who donated on average $43.54 \u2013 a trend that is likely to continue as Sanders has railed against \u201cthe billionaire class\u201d and overly lax campaign finance regulations that have increased the influence of mega donors in recent election cycles. Sanders again resisted attacking Clinton, so far his only announced opponent in the Democratic field, insisting that he is \u201crunning for working families and the middle class, not against Hillary Clinton.\u201d Sanders instead pivoted to his campaign platform: railing against wealth inequality in America, which he called \u201cabsolutely obscene\u201d and calling for breaking up the \u201ctoo big to fail\u201d banks, which he suggested makes them \u201ctoo big to exist.\u201d Sanders is also pushing to expand Social Security, raise taxes on the wealth and create a tuition-free college program.

            "article_content": "Watch CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer interview Sen. Bernie Sanders on \u201cWolf\u201d on Thursday at 1 p.m. EDT. Bernie Sanders is in. The independent Vermont senator railed against the political machine \u2014 blasting \u201cugly 30-second ads,\u201d billionaire big-money donors and other \u201csoap opera aspects of modern campaigns\u201d \u2014 in a press conference kicking off his candidacy outside the Capitol on Thursday. \u201cI think the American people are tired of that,\u201d Sanders said. He said he is running to thwart trade deals like the 12-country Trans-Pacific Partnership and to overhaul business tax rules so corporations operating in the United States cannot shelter their money overseas. \u201cTheir responsibilities are not to shift jobs to China, their responsibility is not to avoid paying federal taxes,\u201d he said. Sanders first announced his run in an email to supporters and media sent just after midnight early Thursday morning. Bernie Sanders' political career \u201cAfter a year of travel, discussion and dialogue, I have decided to be a candidate for the Democratic nomination for president,\u201d he wrote in the email, highlighting economic inequality, climate change and the Citizens United Supreme Court decisions as key issues spurring him to run. Sanders first confirmed to the Associated Press in a story published Wednesday that he plans to run for the Democrats\u2019 2016 presidential nomination. \u201cPeople should not underestimate me,\u201d Sanders told The Associated Press. \u201cI\u2019ve run outside of the two-party system, defeating Democrats and Republicans, taking on big-money candidates and, you know, I think the message that has resonated in Vermont is a message that can resonate all over this country.\u201d Who is Bernie Sanders? Sanders caucuses with the Democrats in the Senate but is an unlikely candidate for the Democratic nomination, primarily because he has never been a registered member of the party and calls himself a \u201cdemocratic socialist.\u201d Yet many of his views fit with the Democratic left, a constituency in which Sanders has found a small yet devout following. Sanders and his top advisers hope that group of voters will propel his dark horse candidacy. Though Hillary Clinton is the dominant frontrunner, many in the progressive left of the party think she\u2019s too moderate and are clamoring for a different candidate to support. For their part, the Democratic National Committee offered a measured welcome of Sanders to the 2016 race on Thursday. \u201cSanders is well-recognized for his principled leadership and has consistently stood up for middle class families,\u201d DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz said in the statement. \u201cThroughout his service in the U.S. House and Senate, Bernie Sanders has clearly demonstrated his commitment to the values we all share as members of the Democratic Party.\u201d Sanders\u2019 campaign advisers said that while their candidate has announced his plans to run, he won\u2019t hold his first campaign rally until May. That event is expected to be in Vermont. Here comes Bernie Sanders READ: The Democratic presidential nominee that doesn\u2019t have to be a registered Democrat Sanders is an outspoken critic of Wall Street banks and the outsized influence of money in politics and is a supporter of universal health care. He regularly talks about the need to rebuild the middle class and raise taxes on America\u2019s highest earners. \u201cAt a time of massive wealth and income inequality, we need a progressive tax system in this country which is based on ability to pay,\u201d Sanders said last month in Washington. \u201cIt is not acceptable that a number of major profitable corporations have paid zero in federal income taxes in recent years, and that millionaire hedge fund managers often enjoy an effective tax rate which is lower than the truck drivers or nurses.\u201d In interviews before his campaign announcement, Sanders said trade, income inequality and health care would be key tenants of his run. But despite having vocal liberal supporters on these issues, Sanders is a dark horse candidate and has acknowledged that his run will be uphill. A CNN/ORC poll in March found that Sanders has the support of only 3% of Democratic voters. Born in Brooklyn, New York, Sanders moved to Vermont after graduating from the University of Chicago. His first successful run for office came in 1981 when he was elected Burlington\u2019s mayor by a mere 10 votes. He was elected as Vermont\u2019s at-large member of Congress in 1990 and jumped to the Senate in 2007. Sanders is the longest-serving independent in congressional history. Sanders does not have the personality of a typical politician. He is sometimes gruff and blunt, dispensing with social niceties and usually getting right to the point. He has come to be known as much for his fly-away hair as his passionate speeches in the Senate \u2013 and has bluntly lamented the way political journalism in the United States focuses on personality. Sen. Sanders talks trade deals READ: Sanders watches as the Left looks to Warren \u201cI think this is not about personality,\u201d Sanders told CNN earlier this year, raising his Vermonter-by-way-of-New York voice. \u201cI am not a singer, I am not a dancer, I am not an entertainer.\u201d He also starts with a small campaign infrastructure, largely the remnants of his past Senate runs, and is primarily being advised by Tad Devine, a Democratic political consultant who worked on the presidential campaign for Al Gore in 2000 and John Kerry in 2004. At an event this month in New Hampshire where Sanders leaned heavily into a presidential bid, the signs outside the house party touted his 2012 Senate re-election bid. From the outset of his campaign, it appears money will be Sanders\u2019 biggest issue. The senator has regularly conceded in the last month that he would not be able to raise near the money Clinton will bring in. \u201cTo run a credible campaign in this day and age, you do need a whole lot of money,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cWhether the magic number is $200 million, it is $150 million, it is a lot of money, but even with that, you would be enormously outspent by the Koch Brother candidates and the other candidates who will likely spend, in the final analysis, over $1 billion, if not two.\u201d Despite being a champion for many on the left, Sanders has been somewhat left out in the cold by big liberal organizations like MoveOn.org and Democracy for America, who have spent the last few months unsuccessfully urging Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren to run for president. \u201cObviously one would hope one would have as much support as possible from all walks of life,\u201d Sanders said on Tuesday when asked why he thinks those groups aren\u2019t rallying around him. \u201cI am a great fan of Elizabeth and as for what people do and why they don\u2019t do it, I am not going to speculate.\u201d Potential 2016 presidential candidates Anna Galland, executive director of MoveOn.org Civic Action, even mentioned Warren in touting Sanders\u2019 jump into the race. \u201cMoveOn members welcome Sen. Bernie Sanders to the presidential race,\u201d said Galland. \u201cThe Democratic Party is made stronger by each additional voice who enters the race and commits to being a strong advocate for everyday, hardworking Americans and not just the wealthy few. That\u2019s why we and our allies continue to call on Sen. Elizabeth Warren to also bring her tireless advocacy for middle-class and working Americans to the race. Our country will be stronger if she runs.\u201d Sanders enters a race that has so far been dominated by Clinton, the former secretary of state and Democrats\u2019 prohibitive favorite for the nomination. For most of 2015, Sanders has been reticent to attack Clinton, but he recently has issued statements calling on her to change her policy positions.

Martin O\u2019Malley called the Republican Party\u2019s assertion that overly-burdensome regulations are contributing to inequality \u201cpatently bulls\u2014.\u201d In an interview with NPR \u201cMorning Edition\u201d host Steve Inskeep that aired Monday, O\u2019Malley, who is openly contemplating a bid for the Democratic presidential nomination, responded to questions concerning the GOP\u2019s crusade against regulations. He said he didn\u2019t see \u201cany truth\u201d to the argument from Republicans that too many government regulations can prevent Americans from advancing economically they\u2019re unable to hire the lawyers to navigate them. O\u2019Malley went on to agree that large corporations can navigate regulations in a way small businesses can\u2019t, saying \u201cour tax code\u2019s been turned into Swiss cheese.\u201d \u201cAnd certainly the concentrated wealth and accumulated power and the systematic deregulation of Wall Street has led to this situation where the economy isn\u2019t working for most of us. All of that is true,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it is not true that regulation holds poor people down or regulation keeps middle class from advancing. That\u2019s kind of patently bulls\u2014.\u201d They were some of the strongest words yet from the former governor, who has been working to frame himself as a progressive alternative to former secretary of State Hillary Clinton if he enters the race, as is expected. Political funny: a challenge to Hillary? Can this Democrat really beat Hillary Clinton? O\u2019Malley insisted he hasn\u2019t made a decision, and said he will by the end of May, but sounded like a candidate in the interview, promising to lay his policies out \u201cwhen I get into the race.\u201d He said he would draw a contrast with Clinton as a \u201cprogressive executive with a record of accomplishments,\u201d versus Clinton\u2019s \u201cexperience as a legislator and secretary of state,\u201d and also suggested there would be a \u201cperspective difference\u201d between the two. \u201cI see, having spoken to younger people, people under 40, where our country\u2019s headed. And it is not the sort of siloed and bureaucratic and ideological world of many of us baby boomers and our older siblings. It is a more connected world and it is a more collaborative and open and transparent world,\u201d he said. The former Maryland governor has avoided criticizing Clinton outright, but has emerged as master of critical innuendo, last week hinting at an attack on Clinton\u2019s shift on gay marriage. He refused to directly criticize that move in the NPR interview, but offered another pointed non-answer when asked whether Clinton could win the presidency if nominated. \u201cBoth of those decisions, the nomination and the ultimate election are up to the people of the United States,\u201d O\u2019Malley said. \u201cI think she would be a far better president than any of the candidates I\u2019ve so far seen emerge in the Republican Party.\u201d",

Still, Emanuel, whose tough political persona is legendary, appeared humble in the wake of a fierce six-week runoff battle that served as a proxy war between the ascendant progressive wing of the Democratic party and the more traditional centrist bloc. \u201cI want to thank you for putting me through my paces.

But in victory, he rattled off a list of progressive priorities, including a hike in the minimum wage, and pledged to unite the city But he warned that \u201cin an era of hard choices, I can\u2019t promise that everyone will be pleased with every decision.\u201d It\u2019s an era of significant financial challenges for the city, including a $20 billion pension crisis and $300 million operating budget shortfall that have resulted in multiple downgrades in the city\u2019s bond rating. The city\u2019s financial woes, and the reforms Emanuel undertook to try to address them, produced widespread backlash from Chicago\u2019s teachers, working class and minority communities that ultimately drove Emanuel to a runoff in February. Those economic challenges are now Emanuel\u2019s problem to solve, after he won with 56% support to Garcia\u2019s 44%, with about three-fourths of precincts reporting. Garcia, meanwhile, said he called Emanuel to concede on Tuesday night but delivered more of a stump speech than a concession, framing his loss in optimistic terms and criticizing the status quo in Chicago. \u201cWe didn\u2019t lose today, we tried today,\u201d he told a crowd of supporters. \u201cWe fought hard for what we believe in.\u201d He went on to decry a \u201cgrowth crisis\u201d in Chicago that can\u2019t be fixed with taxes or borrowing, and called for better schools and less crime on the city\u2019s streets. Preliminary results indicate Emanuel was able to boost turnout in the city\u2019s majority white communities on the Chicago lakefront and on the North side, as well as maintain a strong lead in the African American neighborhoods on Chicago\u2019s West and South side. The race has seen a huge surge in early votes, with more than 142,000 Chicagoans submitting their ballots early, up from just about 90,000 before the February vote, which saw unusually low turnout. But the early vote indicated Garcia was heading into Election Day already at a disadvantage, as turnout was low in Hispanic-majority areas. Garcia\u2019s team was predicting victory up until the end, however, promising a never-before-seen ground effort buoyed by the organizational abilities of the Chicago Teachers\u2019 Union and a handful of local and progressive groups working to oust Emanuel. RELATED: Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel faces divided Chicago in reelection fight The city\u2019s financial challenges ultimately took center stage in the final week of campaigning as Emanuel has sought to paint Garcia, a Cook County commissioner, as inexperienced and unfit for the job of fixing the city\u2019s financial mess. He aired a series of hard-hitting attack ads accusing Garcia of dodging questions and refusing to offer particulars on his policy proposals. And Garcia has given the incumbent ample fodder for such attacks \u2014 he\u2019s refused to name members of an expert panel he plans to appoint to craft those policies, won\u2019t put dollar amounts on the reforms he has proposed and significant chunks of his plan aren\u2019t even under the mayor\u2019s control. But those financial woes were also part of what made Emanuel so vulnerable to a challenge in the first place. Many of the city\u2019s residents felt he hadn\u2019t done enough to solve the city\u2019s sluggish economy, and critics said what steps he has taken \u2014 like closing public health clinics, 50 public schools and installing red light cameras to raise fees \u2014 have only made the problem worse for Chicago\u2019s low-income and minority communities. The perception that Emanuel\u2019s forgotten about the disadvantaged pockets of the city put Chicago\u2019s sizable African American vote into play, and the two candidates spent the final weeks of the campaign vying for the black vote on Chicago\u2019s South and West sides. Emanuel rolled out the endorsements of a number of the city\u2019s most prominent African American state legislators, and campaigned with Atlanta Mayor Kasim Reed on Saturday, before hitting a number of churches for Easter Sunday. Garcia, meanwhile, played up his affiliation to former Chicago Mayor Harold Washington, the city\u2019s first African American mayor, and touted endorsements from Emanuel\u2019s main black challenger during the first round of votes and Rev. Jesse L. Jackson. That perception also fueled a progressive backlash against Emanuel that parallels the broader debate within the Democratic Party, between its business-minded and working-class wings. Garcia hit Emanuel as a traditional pay-for-play politician more interested in helping his wealthy donors than improving the city, pointing to the business leaders who have contributed to his campaign, and could stand to benefit from city grant money, as evidence. In contrast, the challenger framed himself in the mold of Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, and is getting help from many groups that consider themselves a part of the \u201cWarren wing\u201d of the party \u2014 Move On, the Progressive Change Campaign Committee and the Working Families Party, to name a few. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, an independent who\u2019s emerged as another leader of the progressive movement, campaigned for the challenger in Chicago last week.",

            "article_content": "Two Democrats who may run for president in 2016 will be in Iowa this week, and neither one is named Hillary Clinton. Former Virginia Sen. Jim Webb and former Maryland Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley will head to the first-in-the-nation caucus state Thursday as part of a multi-day trip for the prospective candidates. The two had committed to headlining a Polk County Democrats Awards Dinner earlier this year, but in the face of an imminent Clinton announcement \u2013 and the fact they are still exploring bids \u2013 both Webb and O\u2019Malley beefed up their schedules in Iowa. Webb will spend four days in the state, headlining a total of six events that range from a small meet and greet at a local library to a speech to a local Vietnamese group in Des Moines. Craig Crawford, Webb\u2019s spokesman, said the trip was \u201cAll part of Jim\u2019s seriousness of purpose about exploring a presidential bid.\u201d Webb\u2019s trip to Iowa starts Thursday in the state\u2019s more conservative west with a meet and greet at the Council Bluffs Library. On Friday, Webb will sit down for an interview with WHO\u2019s Jan Michelson in Des Moines and then headline the Polk County dinner. Webb, a decorated Vietnam War veteran, will headline a meeting of the UAW Veterans Caucus and Cedar Valley Veterans on Saturday. The event, in Waterloo, Iowa, will be held at the Sullivan Brothers Veterans Museum. The former senator will then tour the Cedar Valley Tech Works factory, a cluster of research, education and manufacturing facilities in Waterloo that includes \u201cThe John Deere Waterloo & Tractor Museum\u201d and a John Deere Regional Training Center. And, on Saturday night, Webb will headline a dinner meeting for the Iowa Vietnamese Alliance at the Vietnamese Cultural Center in Des Moines. Webb is married to Hong Le Webb, a Vietnamese lawyer who escaped the country after the fall of Saigon in April 1975. Webb speaks Vietnamese fluently. Lastly, on Sunday, Webb will headline a fundraiser for Iowa House Reps. Todd Prichard and Sharon Steckman in Mason City. RELATED: O\u2019Malley, Webb to address South Carolina Democrats\u200b \u201cI think it\u2019s safe to say that Iowans and the rest of the country are tired of the \u201csame ol\u2019, same ol\u2019\u201d rhetoric when it comes to today\u2019s political atmosphere,\u201d said Rania Batrice, the head of Webb\u2019s Iowa operation. \u201cThey\u2019re ready for someone different, someone who will put people ahead of politics. That is Jim Webb. We are eager for Iowans to get a chance to meet Jim, get to know him, and see what he\u2019s all about.\u201d O\u2019Malley\u2019s busiest day in Iowa is Thursday, when the former governor will speak at a fundraiser for Iowa House Rep. Scott Ourth at a winery in Indianola and headline an event for the Central Iowa Democrats for Action in Des Moines. The invite to the later event, which will be held a Cooney\u2019s Tavern, highlights O\u2019Malley\u2019s \u201cstrong progressive record in the state of Maryland.\u201d On Friday, the governor will headline the the Polk County Democratic dinner. This week\u2019s trip to Iowa will be Webb\u2019s first of 2015, but O\u2019Malley has been a staple at Democratic events in the state for much of the last year. The governor visited Iowa last month, where he crisscrossed the state for events and meetings with Democratic voters and supporters. Although Webb, a Southern Democrat vying to connect with the white working class of his party,  and O\u2019Malley, a progressive executive vying for the left of the party, are politically different, they both find themselves in similar 2016 situations. In a March CNN/ORC poll of national Democrats, only 1% said O\u2019Malley and Webb were their top choice. In a January poll from Bloomberg Politics and the Des Moines Register, O\u2019Malley was at 1% among Iowa Democrats, while Webb found himself at 3%. Clinton, the prohibitive favorite for the Democratic nomination who is expected to announce her candidacy in the next two weeks, holds a massive lead in all polls.  While Webb and O\u2019Malley sit at 1%, the former secretary of state has 62% support from her party, according to CNN/ORC. Clinton last visited Iowa in October - during the 2014 midterm election - but her nascent campaign has dispatched staff to start organizing in the state and her top national aides visited the Iowa last month.

            "article_content": "To some liberal Democrats, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren is the perfect messenger for 2016\u2019s presidential election, not Hillary Clinton. But asked on Tuesday whether Clinton is the right spokesperson for liberal issues in 2016, Warren urged people to give the former secretary of state a little time to outline her platform. \u201cI think we need to give her a chance, if she is going to run, and to declare,\u201d Warren said on NBC\u2019s \u201cToday\u201d on Tuesday. \u201cAnd to lay out what she wants to run on. I think that is her opportunity to\u201d champion issues the senators feels are important. Warren continued: \u201cI think that everyone needs to be talking about in every race in ever part of this country about how it is that we build a future. Because right now, Washington is working great for those who have money and power. \u2026 It is just not working so great for the American people, for real families and that is why we have to make a change.\u201d A handful of liberal groups who aren\u2019t thrilled by the idea of a Clinton candidacy have backed a Warren run and started multiple draft campaigns to show the senator the kind of support she would enjoy. But the efforts have failed to move the needle for Warren, who said for the umpteenth time Tuesday that she was not going to run for president in 2016 and never considered a bid. RELATED: Could Warren-mania hurt progressive Democrats? \u201cNo. I am not running and I am not going to run,\u201d Warren said, adding that she is focused on \u201cworking on the issues the people of Massachusetts sent me to work on.\u201d Liberals want Clinton to be a vocal champion for issues like Wall Street reform, the environment and leveling the playing field for lower and middle class families. The former first lady has spoken out on a number of those issues in the past, but liberals want to see action, not just words, and are concerned with Clinton\u2019s close ties to America\u2019s largest financial institutions. Despite swatting away calls for her to run \u2013 and the fact that most presidential polls show her in the low double digits \u2013 Warren will still be a 2016 power broker. Clinton \u2013 who is expected to announce her presidential bid early next month \u2013 has sought advice from the Massachusetts senator \u201cseveral times\u201d in the last year, a source with knowledge of Clinton\u2019s plans told CNN in February, a sign of how important Warren\u2019s wing of the Democratic party is to the foundation of a would-be presidential bid for the former secretary of state.

            "article_content": "The graveyard of presidential politics is littered with White House hopefuls who were convinced they could run a successful campaign that defied party orthodoxy on big issues, rejected the soundbite driven media culture and assumed an easy application of experience-to-date to the national political stage. It\u2019s proof that concocting the winning mix remains largely elusive. But Ohio Gov. John Kasich is obviously on a mission to find the proper alchemy. The Republican put his desire on display Wednesday at a meeting with reporters, fresh from his trip to New Hampshire where he road-tested his potential 2016 message. Kasich defends Ohio's use of Medicaid expansion money READ: Ben Carson calls Obama a \u2018psychopath\u2019 \u201cIf you don\u2019t help the mentally ill, they end up in a prison or in a jail or on the streets. There\u2019s a societal cost to that that\u2019s ongoing,\u201d Kasich said at a lunch hosted by Bloomberg View. \u201cIf you don\u2019t help the working poor to figure out a way to become independent, there\u2019s a societal to cost to that as well.\u201d \u201cAnd I think when people hear what the message is about everybody deserves a chance, everybody needs to be helped, I think that\u2019s an American message. I think that\u2019s a message that people relate to,\u201d he said. Kasich\u2019s case for a fiscal conservatism that is rewarded by a greater human experience as much as a surplus budget is essential to his potential candidacy, where many conservative voters may criticize his decision to expand Medicaid in his state by accepting federal money made available through Obamacare. The former House Budget Committee chairman \u2013 who has been barnstorming the country trying to get enough states on board to ratify a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution \u2013 says fiscal conservatism can\u2019t simply be about getting the ledger sheet to show a surplus. It must also be about applying that available money to the right kinds of programs to help socioeconomically disadvantaged Americans help themselves to a brighter future. Ohio Gov.: Handling ISIS requires 'boots on the ground' SEE: Jeb Bush fundraising is a family affair \u201cI don\u2019t like the term, particularly, \u2018compassionate conservative,\u2019 because that implies that we just give people something and that\u2019s the end of it,\u201d Kasich said. \u201cOur idea is you help them so that they can get in a position where they can help themselves and break whatever cycle they may be a part of.\u201d His is a brand of politics that may be coming into its moment within the GOP. For years the Republican Party has steadfastly played the role of the loyal opposition to President Barack Obama by decrying his proposals and promising to undo his major initiatives \u2013 most prominently Obamacare. But the class of emerging 2016 White House candidates is full of those seeking to move beyond that rhetoric. Sens. Rand Paul and Marco Rubio, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush have all tried to burnish their credentials pressing forward on issues such as prison reform, assistance for drug addicts and the mentally ill and greater social mobility. Kasich, however, may be alone in making these policy proposals the very centerpiece of his campaign. \u201cWho are these people who are defining what it means to be a conservative?\u201d Kasich asked, taking head-on those who criticize decision to expand Medicaid and willingness to consider a pathway to citizenship for illegal immigrants currently in the United States. Kasich acknowledged some of his positions were out of step with the party base, but was undeterred. \u201cMaybe people who say those things are reshaping the party; We have a right to reshape it. Ronald Reagan reshaped it,\u201d he said, name-checking the transformative conservative icon. Kasich did concede one area of weakness though \u2013 he would have to hone his campaign skills if he takes the leap. \u201cEither I practice or I don\u2019t do it,\u201d he said, admitting he would have a tough time making substantive points about prison reform, say, in a 45-second debate answer. Kasich also demonstrated he still has brushing up to do on some policy issues before he can fully dive into a credible presidential campaign, punting on a question about how we would alter the financial services and banking reform law known as Dodd-Frank. \u201cI have to get back to you on the financial regulation,\u201d he said. On foreign policy, he touted his 18 years on the House Armed Services Committee, but only offered the general critique that America\u2019s relationship with world leaders \u2013 or lack thereof \u2013 is the primary problem, declining to delve into specifics. Electability, Kasich said, is key \u2013 he is fond of saying how extremism won\u2019t play in Ohio. He touted his huge re-election victory in one of the most significant battleground states in the country \u2013 which included receiving 26% of the African-American vote \u2013 as the very model the Republican Party needs to follow for success. \u201cI want people to hear what I think about these foundational American values of personal responsibility, resilience, family and faith,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are things that people can learn from somebody who leads a state like Ohio which is, frankly, a microcosm of the country.\u201d The challenge for Kasich won\u2019t be a lack of ideas or energy or enthusiasm for the road ahead. His challenge will be convincing the conservative activists that dominate the primary electorate that so-called compassionate conservatism \u2013 the very label Kasich is loathe to embrace \u2013 deserves a second chance. \u201cIf it doesn\u2019t work, I\u2019m not doing it to make it work.  I\u2019m doing it because it is what I want to do,\u201d he said.",

            "article_content": "Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker is on an ambitious mission this spring to scoop up major GOP donors ahead of a likely presidential run and send the early message that former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush doesn\u2019t have a monopoly on the country\u2019s deep-pocketed Republicans \u2013 and his backers say his plan is working. So far the expedition has been successful enough that Republicans not involved with his political effort have noticed, and several GOP operatives in Bush\u2019s orbit conceded to CNN it\u2019s clear a substantial chunk of GOP financiers have taken a liking to him. Walker\u2019s PAC, Our American Revival, provided CNN with a list of names of reliable Republican donors who have already committed to bundle funds for him or contribute significantly to a Super PAC that would be developed to support him should he run. And Republican fundraisers have told CNN donors are lining up to meet with him as he\u2019s rocketing up in the polls. \u201cThe fact that the primaries are a year away means that the Bush team knows that they must keep an eye on Walker\u2019s fundraising efforts,\u201d said Republican strategist Ron Bonjean. \u201cWinning the majority of major donors early on can help fuel momentum for front-runner status and Walker knows his team has to give it everything it has in order to keep Bush from locking them up.\u201d RELATED: In New Hampshire, Scott Walker draws contrast with Jeb Bush Bush bounded out of the starting gate and has gathered together a sprawling finance operation drawn from his family\u2019s donor network from the campaigns of George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush over the past 30 years. His political team intends to rake in a massive haul of cash in the first reporting period after launching a campaign, and the perception has taken root in Washington that no other Republican will have the ability to amass a war chest anywhere near the size of his. A top Walker aide said he fully expects a future campaign would be wildly outspent by Bush. But Walker is working to cast himself as a fresher and more conservative alternative who can appeal to both the mainstream and the party\u2019s right flank. So he\u2019s diving into the country\u2019s biggest financial centers and has met with card-carrying members of the GOP\u2019s well-heeled donor class in Chicago, Los Angeles, Miami and New York. In two weeks he\u2019ll head to Texas Sen. Ted Cruz\u2019s territory to do the same when he\u2019s in Houston to headline the Harris County Lincoln Reagan Dinner on March 28. When he toured the Chicago financial circuit last week, he came away with a hefty check from Citadel Investment Group founder Kenneth Griffin, a billionaire, who could bankroll a future Walker Super PAC. Griffin has not selected a candidate to exclusively support, according to a source close to Griffin. But Walker supporters were encouraged by the donation, which was described as being \u201cin the low six figures.\u201d Election law allows potential candidates to coordinate fundraising for Super PACs before campaigns are formalized, so Walker can line up contributors for that purpose now. But when the Wisconsinite asked Griffin for an undisclosed sum, Griffin replied: \u201cThat\u2019s all you want?\u201d according to Republicans familiar with the discussion. RELATED: Influential Iowa Republican snubs Jeb Bush for Scott Walker The hedge fund manager maxed out to the Republican Party earlier this year. In 2014, he and his wife, Anne, gave $3.6 million to Republican causes, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. He contributed to Romney and the Super PAC created to boost Romney\u2019s campaign in 2011 Restore Our Future, but he didn\u2019t make those donations until later in the cycle \u2013 beginning in November of 2011, when the primary competition was well under way. In California, Florida and New York \u2013 all states with large pools of potential donors attractive to candidates \u2013 Walker has come away with commitments from millionaires and billionaires who will help him compete financially against Bush. CALIFORNIA From California, Walker has a variety of commitments, including real estate mogul John Peck, who donated to Ted Cruz\u2019s campaign account and leadership PAC in September of 2013, exactly one week before Cruz filibustered for 21 hours on defunding Obamacare that ultimately led to the government shutdown. He\u2019s also given to Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, and in the 2012 cycle, he made contributions to Michele Bachmann, Herman Cain and Ron Paul before finally giving to Romney. Developer \u201cPapa\u201d Doug Manchester, the founder of the San Diego Union Tribune who committed to Mitt Romney early in primary process by giving his super PAC $25,000 in the summer of 2011, is now on board with Walker. In 2013, he donated to Rubio and his leadership PAC. San Diego-based Peter Farrell, a philanthropist and the founder of the medical device company, ResMed, will also support him. FLORIDA Walker has already seen success in Bush and Rubio territory in Florida, scoring billionaire couple Frayda and George Lindemann, who owned the energy company, Southern Union. George Lindemann has given money to candidates on both sides of the aisle and maxed out to Hillary Clinton in 2007 before turning to Romney, but more recently he\u2019s given to Rubio and his PAC. Also with him are Stanley and Gay Gaines, longtime GOP fundraisers who donated to Romney\u2019s Super PAC in 2012; former dairy company executive Marc Goldman, who sits on the Republican Jewish Coalition\u2019s board and gave nearly $90,000 to the pro-Israel American Principles Super PAC in 2012; hedge fund manager Ron Santella, and his wife, Jessica; and financier Thomas Patrick of New Vernon Capital. TEXAS Though the state is fertile territory for Cruz and Perry, Walker has made some inroads there, as well, with a handful of longtime Republican donors. Already with him are investment banker Dan Cook, former energy executive Bob Kay and the anti-union Brent Southwell, the CEO of Professional Janitorial Service in Houston. Brothers Jacob and Dan Eberhart, who jointly run the energy company, Canary, and the private equity firm, Eberhart Capital, will also back him; as will business partners Bob Rasmus and James Whipkey, who run energy company, Hi-Crush Partners, as well as private equity firm, Red Oak Capital. CORRECTION: This item article originally reported that Kenneth Griffin was backing Walker\u2019s potential candidacy. While Griffin donated a sum described by one source as being \u201cin the low six figures,\u201d to Walker\u2019s PAC, a source close to Griffin says he has not selected a candidate to exclusively support.

            "article_content": "Hillary Clinton\u2019s biggest challenge to a smooth launch of her 2016 campaign is a familiar one: Herself. At the very least, the controversy over her exclusive use of personal \u2013 instead of official \u2013 email while Secretary of State threatens to further complicate her expected 2016 White House candidacy. The news is all the more challenging for Clinton after stinging criticism of foreign donations to her family\u2019s philanthropic foundation and her comments about her personal wealth. But the email saga \u2013 complete with echoes of scandals from the 1990s \u2013 is perhaps the starkest reminder yet of the daunting risk Democrats are taking. The party is heading into a presidential campaign with a likely candidate who is a world figure with a proven domestic appeal \u2013 see the 18 million primary votes she snagged in 2008 \u2013 but who also has significant political vulnerabilities. Clinton\u2019s stuttering last few months represent the kind of rough political patch that a strong Democratic primary opponent could exploit. But Clinton\u2019s grip on the Democratic Party is so strong that no leading power broker is criticizing her,  in the knowledge that the party lacks any other heavy-hitters for 2016. There is certainly no one with the star power or clout to capitalize on Clinton\u2019s troubles like Barack Obama did so successfully in 2008. \u201cI don\u2019t see there is any credible challenger,\u201d said one Democratic strategist, voicing the private belief of many in the party. READ: Clinton asks State to release emails While Sen. Elizabeth Warren is a rock star for the Democratic grass roots for her populist anti-Wall Street rhetoric, few in the party see her as a strong potential general election candidate. Vice President Joe Biden is biding his time and is beloved among Democrats, but would be an extreme long shot to beat Clinton. Another possible runner, former Maryland Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley, polls lower than the margin of error in early surveys of the race. Clinton to State Department: Release my emails It is testimony to the power of Hillary and Bill Clinton among Democrats that there are few prominent party figures willing to go on the record to voice doubts about the former secretary of state.  It may also be a sign that key party figures realize that while Clinton may have flaws, she represents the only realistic chance of the party pulling off the rare feat of winning three presidential elections in a row. But if there is no Democrat to take her down, Republicans believe that the email saga is another chance to severely weaken Clinton. They say the question of Clinton\u2019s emails may reverberate deep into the campaign, because it fits a critical narrative that the Clinton way of politics is underhanded and often skirts the rules. Republican lawmakers, meanwhile, have the power to take the drama in unexpected directions as  \u2013 armed with subpoenas \u2013 they plow through pages of turned over documents. Though Clinton\u2019s defenders insist she did nothing \u201cnefarious,\u201d and say she turned over 55,000 emails to the State Department last year, Republican National Committee spokesman Michael Short said Clinton set up a \u201chomebrewed\u201d server system to \u201cskirt\u201d federal transparency regulations for top officials. Kevin Madden, a Republican strategist who worked for Mitt Romney\u2019s presidential campaigns, said the controversy would help the eventual GOP nominee build a case against Clinton. \u201cIt may look like it is an transparency issue right now, but the bigger problem for the Clinton campaign is that this is going to morph into a character issue for Hillary Clinton,\u201d Madden said. Republicans demands that more emails be turned over could also fuel other efforts by Clinton\u2019s foes on Capitol Hill, including those running the probe into the murder of U.S. ambassador Chris Stevens in Benghazi, Libya, while she was secretary of state. READ: Stumbles fuel Clinton\u2019s Dem critics All of this, combined with the lack of any clear sense as to the values and themes that are compelling a new Clinton campaign \u2013 other than a historic quest to be the first woman president \u2013 is contributing to a sense of uncertainty around her prospective White House effort. \u201cA crucial part of a campaign of a successful campaign roll out is momentum,\u201d said Madden. \u201cThis reminds the public of Clinton hangovers they had \u2026. or every scandal that has been litigated. It is just drama after drama with them.\u201d Privately, some Democrats are getting nervous that the kind of disarray that helped pull Clinton\u2019s 2008 campaign apart might be resurfacing \u2013 even as others argue this is very much an arcane Beltway storm that is unlikely to trouble heartland voters. Some are asking how a politician who has been as thoroughly investigated as Clinton, and who knew she might run for president again, would ever make a decision to sidestep official State Department email accounts. And if it turns out the server Clinton set up to handle her email at her New York home was not sufficiently secure, the episode could take a much more serious turn and threaten her ability to argue that she\u2019s strong on national security. Still, the email episode seems well down the list of blockbuster scandals the Clintons have survived \u2013 so it\u2019s possible its impact could turn out to be peripheral to her political ambitions. Dem: Clinton emails controversy symptomatic of problems If so, it would mark the latest twist in an extraordinary tale of missteps and redemption that the Clintons have lived on repeat for much of their 40 years in politics. Tracy Sefl, a senior advisor for the group \u201cReady for Hillary,\u201d detected no great concern about the email flap among elected officials at an \u201cEmily\u2019s List\u201d dinner headlined by Clinton this week. \u201cEach of them said with great conviction that their constituents could not care less about this,\u201d Sefl said. \u201cRather, their same constituents prefer to hear her ideas about issues that affect their lives. Yes, it\u2019s a familiar refrain, but that\u2019s because it remains true.\u201d Both Clintons have long records of turning the heat of a political controversy away \u2013 by showing that they are working hard for vulnerable middle class Americans who care little for Beltway scandal. But Hillary Clinton is handicapped right now because she is not a declared candidate. She can\u2019t just get out on the stump and change the conversation or surround herself with loving crowds. Some Democrats believe the last few days show the downside of Clinton\u2019s strategy not to jump into the race early, even though she lacks a serious primary opponent. With this in mind, her late-night Tweet on Wednesday revealing that she had asked the State Department to reveal the content of her emails, only contributed to a feeling that she is dodging direct questions. The White House, meanwhile, is in a tough spot as the row over Clinton emails becomes the latest point of tension in the long psychodrama between President Barack Obama and the Clintons. It might not have been about Whitewater, Filegate, Travelgate or Monica Lewinsky but White House spokesman Josh Earnest got a small taste this week of what his 1990s predecessors like Mike McCurry faced when he was pummelled with questions about an alleged Clinton scandal. Earnest\u2019s uncomfortable replies, in which he cited State Department procedures for the archiving of official email, appeared to be an attempt to insulate the White House from scandal while avoiding pitching the woman who is the best hope of preserving Obama\u2019s legacy deeper into the mire. It\u2019s was an especially ironic moment, because Obama often implicitly invoked the Clinton wars to justify his push for a new kind of politics during his 2008 campaign. A longtime Clinton ally admitted that there is an understanding in her camp now that the current flap could continue to fester. \u201cThere is a sense among her allies that this story is complicated, and that it won\u2019t go away any time soon,\u201d the person said. \u201cIt won\u2019t matter in the end, given what a known quantity she already is across the political spectrum, but it will nonetheless linger.\u201d",

            "article_content": "President Obama said he welcomed Republicans talking about income inequality \"if it actually leads them to take different actions\" Potential 2016 Republican contenders have started mentioning the growing income gap and pushing the party to do the same The President views the improving economy after a difficult recession as a potential cornerstone of his legacy President Barack Obama sought to reclaim some ownership over an issue that is suddenly a hot topic among top Republicans, telling an audience on Friday that he welcomes his rival party focusing on income inequality, but questioned whether it was anything more than talk. \u201cNow that their grand predictions of doom and gloom and death panels and Armageddon haven\u2019t come true. The sky hasn\u2019t fallen, chicken little is quiet,\u201d Obama said. \u201cThe new plan is to re-brand themselves as the party of the middle class. I am not making this up.\u201d To laughs from the Democratic National Committee audience in Washington, D.C., Obama added: \u201cI am encouraged they are speaking about middle class and about wages. But there is this old saying, you can\u2019t just talk the talk. \u2026 You\u2019ve got to walk the walk.\u201d Income inequality and the growing gap between the richest and poorest Americans has become a primary issue in the 2016 election and many Republicans vying for the party\u2019s nomination have focused on the issue. The comments have not gone unnoticed by Democrats and the White House. \u201cWe\u2019re facing right now a divided America when it comes to the economy,\u201d said Sen. Ted Cruz, R-Texas, after Obama\u2019s January address to the nation. \u201cIncome inequality has worsened under this administration,\u201d Sen. Rand Paul, R-Kentucky, said after the President\u2019s State of the Union speech. On Friday, Obama took on Paul directly, noting that the 2016 hopeful once said his party needs to show up \u201cup on the South Side of Chicago\u201d and shout \u201cat the top of our lungs: \u2018We are the party of jobs and opportunity.\u2019\u201d Barack Obama's presidency \u201cI think that is encouraging that he wants to go to the South Side of Chicago,\u201d Obama said with a smile. \u201cI was just home on the South Side of Chicago yesterday and I guarantee you that Senator Paul would be welcome there. We are a friendly bunch.\u201d Obama added: \u201cI mean, it is a little strange if people show up and just start shouting on the top of their lungs. But we are friendly, it would be OK.\u201d When Obama first mentioned Paul, some in the audience groaned at his name. Hearing this, Obama said, \u201cNo, Rand is an interesting guy.\u201d The President views the improving economy after a difficult recession as a potential cornerstone of his legacy. In the foreword to a report on the nation\u2019s brightening fiscal picture from the White House Counsel of Economic Advisors, Obama writes \u201cthe United States has just concluded a breakthrough year.\u201d RELATED: Elizabeth Warren\u2019s supporters look for their next win Obama has made fewer references to the issue of income inequality in recent months in favor the term \u201cmiddle class economics,\u201d which was a major theme of his State of the Union speech. Aides to the President insist GOP leaders have flocked to the issue of income inequality only in an attempt to diminish Democratic claims to the nation\u2019s improving economy. Before the speech, a White House official said Obama would use his DNC speech to call out Republicans for what he sees as hypocrisy. \u201cSo far, at least, the rhetoric has not matched the reality,\u201d Obama said on Friday. \u201cI think the shift in rhetoric that they are engaging in is good, if it actually leads them to take different actions. If it doesn\u2019t, then it is just spin.\u201d The President also seemed to lightly touch on recent comments by former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani, who said earlier this week that he doesn\u2019t think President Barack Obama \u201cloves America.\u201d \u201cThis is not just a sports contest, this Is not just who\u2019s up and down at any given point, it\u2019s not about notches on a belt, it\u2019s not about ideological battles an proving how smart you are,\u201d Obama said. \u201cIt\u2019s about making this nation we love more perfect.\u201d Republicans, in response to most positive economic numbers, have said there are still glaring vulnerabilities in the nation\u2019s recovery. \u201cAfter spending the last six years growing Washington instead of the middle class, it\u2019s no surprise President Obama can only point fingers rather than point to meaningful success,\u201d said Republican National Committee spokesman Michael Short. \u201cThe reality is Americans have suffered under the slowest economic recovery in modern times, and on his watch, the middle class lost its status as being the world\u2019s richest as more and more families fall out rather than move up.\u201d House Republicans have had a similar response to the President\u2019s message. \u201cThere\u2019s a reason why the Democratic Party has lost the House, the Senate, governorships, and more than 900 state legislative seats in recent years. President Obama\u2019s liberal agenda has left America\u2019s working class families behind,\u201d Boehner spokesman Cory Fritz said.",

            "article_content": "The Democratic National Committee is bringing on a former Obama campaign spokeswoman as their national press secretary and launching a new digital-focused position in preparation for 2016, according to details shared first with CNN. It\u2019s part of what DNC Communications Director called an \u201caggressive expansion\u201d of the committee\u2019s communications team heading into the election cycle, which will give Democrats a solid shot at taking back the Senate and holding onto the White House. The DNC has hired Holly Shulman, who formerly served as spokeswoman for international affairs at the Treasury Department, as its new national press secretary, per a committee release. She worked as Obama\u2019s New Hampshire press secretary in 2012 and has previously held communications roles in congressional and statewide races in Ohio, Texas and Pennsylvania. The DNC is also bringing on Michael Tyler, who previously served as Georgia Democratic Senate candidate Michelle Nunn\u2019s press secretary, as its new director of African American media and regional press secretary for the South. It\u2019s hired Sean Bartlett, who was most recently a communications strategist with the UN Foundation, as senior communications adviser for DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz. And the committee has created a new position, digital media director, that will oversee \u201coutreach to and use of emerging digital platforms and new forms of content.\u201d That role will be filled by Rob Flaherty, who was previously the DNC\u2019s video director and director for youth media. DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz said she\u2019s \u201cthrilled\u201d to welcome the new team members, and \u201cexcited\u201d about Flaherty\u2019s new role. \u201cI am thoroughly impressed with the work these individuals have put out in their previous posts, and I am eager for them to bring that energy to the DNC,\u201d she said in a statement. \u201cWe are proud of our premier communications team, and I look forward to working with Michael, Holly, Sean and Rob to elect the 45th President of the United States and other Democrats up and down the ticket.\u201d The Republican National Committee also shuffled its communications staff, bringing on some new members, while others left for campaigns or received promotions. The DNC and RNC are sure to play key roles in the two parties\u2019 messaging and field operations as they face off in the race for the White House in 2016. RELATED: Top RNC communicator expands role DNC Communications Director Mo Elleithee said the new hires will help the committee deliver its message to a wider audience \u201cas we make the contrast clear between a Democratic Party that is fighting for the Middle Class and a Republican Party that is working for the elite few.\u201d And he said there\u2019s more to come: \u201cThis is just the start of an aggressive expansion of our communications team, and I\u2019m excited to kick things into high gear.

            "article_content": "If Jim Webb had his way, the Democratic Party would return to its \u201cFranklin Roosevelt, Harry Truman, Andrew Jackson roots\u201d and put a greater focus on \u201cwhite, working people.\u201d Webb, the former Democratic senator from Virginia who is entertaining a run 2016 presidential nomination, told NPR Friday morning that his party has not focused enough on white, working class voters in the past elections. In order to be successful in the future, Webb said, that will need to change. \u201cI think they could do better with white, working people and I think this last election showed that,\u201d Webb said, referencing the 2014 midterms where Republicans took control of the Senate and added more power in the House. \u201cThe Democratic Party could do very well to return to its Franklin Roosevelt, Harry Truman, Andrew Jackson roots where the focus of the party was making sure that all people who lack a voice in the corridors of power could have one through the elected represented.\u201d Pressed on his statement by NPR\u2019s Steve Inskeep, Webb said that he doesn\u2019t think Democrats\u2019 distancing from white, working people was a byproduct of President Barack Obama\u2019s election. \u201cThis was happening before President Obama,\u201d Webb said. Looking ahead to a 2016 race that he may run in, Webb added: \u201cYou are not going to have a situation again where you have 96% of the African American vote turning out for one presidential candidate. \u2026 We need to get back to the principles of the Democratic Party that we are going to give everyone who needs access to the corridors of power that access regardless of any of your antecedents. I think that is a fair concept.\u201d In 2012, the last presidential election, Republican Mitt Romney won nearly 60% of all white voters, compared to Obama\u2019s 40%. That difference is an increased split from 2008, when Obama won 43% of the white vote and Republican John McCain won 55%. If Webb were to enter the 2016 presidential race, he would do so as a longshot candidate. Not only would he likely be challenging Hillary Clinton for the 2016 nomination, but he told Inskeep that raising money would be a big challenge. Like other Democrats toiling about a presidential run, Webb declined to directly attack Clinton. \u201cI really don\u2019t have an answer for you on that,\u201d he said when asked how he would differentiate himself with the former secretary of state. \u201cShe has not announced that she is running, I haven\u2019t announced that I am running. If I were to run, it would not be as a counterpoint to her. I have issues that I care about, I want to put them on the table and we\u2019ll see.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Barack Obama is done campaigning for president himself \u2013 but he\u2019s still working to make Republicans play defense on issues where they\u2019ve yet to prove themselves. His upcoming State of the Union speech on Tuesday night will lay out a litany of Democratic pipe dreams that have little chance of becoming law. But his proposals are popular with voters and, if he\u2019s able to draw enough attention and his party picks up on them, could offer an early preview of 2016 election themes. Obama\u2019s tax plan: Middle-class credits, increases for rich Top among those plans is one that would raise $320 billion over the next 10 years through a capital gains tax hike and new bank fees \u2013 and use that money to cover his $60 billion pitch for free two-year community college tuition and $175 billion in new tax benefits for the middle class. It\u2019s Obama\u2019s opening offer in what he hopes will be a negotiation with Republican congressional leaders over a major tax overhaul \u2013 which Democrats also hope will free up money to fund some of their top priorities. But conservatives are so likely to reject nearly all of Obama\u2019s pitch that top adviser Dan Pfeiffer, who appeared on two morning news shows on Sunday, got questions about whether the White House is even serious. First, CBS \u201cFace the Nation\u201d host Bob Schieffer: \u201cI mean, is this for real? Do you really think there\u2019s a chance that something like this could pass?\u201d And then NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d moderator Chuck Todd: \u201cIf feels like a campaign because some of the things he\u2019s proposing \u2013 nobody in Washington believes it can get through a Republican Congress.\u201d Republicans plot in chocolate heaven Pfeiffer responded that what Obama is really trying to do is start a new debate \u2013 one the President thinks he can win. \u201cLet me give you the theme of the speech in three words: Middle-class economics,\u201d he told Todd. \u201cHe\u2019s going to talk about how middle-class economics brought us back from the brink and put us to a place where the economy\u2019s growing, jobs are growing, the deficit is shrinking, and it\u2019s all out of his plan to deal, as I said, with wage stagnation and declining economic mobility, in ways we can really help the middle class,\u201d Pfeiffer said. In other words, the White House is thinking: If Republicans want to say no, let them try to explain why. It\u2019s been a successful strategy for Democrats in recent years. Obama\u2019s re-election victory came over Mitt Romney, a candidate who struggled to overcome attacks on his personal wealth, to connect with people who don\u2019t have money. Unemployment is now down to 5.6% from an Obama-era high of 10% in 2009. But the improving jobs numbers aren\u2019t helping many Americans overcome wages that have stagnated \u2013 turning the looming 2016 campaign into a juxtaposition of ideas over how best to help Americans help themselves. Republicans have long favored overhauling the tax code. But they argue a Robin Hood approach isn\u2019t fair \u2013 or effective. They argue that taxes on corporations and wealthy individuals are already too high and penalize those who create jobs. Instead, they\u2019ve favored measures that would allow corporations to bring money earned overseas back into the United States, which they say would jump-start job creation. The Right\u2019s top 5 arguments against Romney in 2016 Still, they recognize that winning over middle-class voters \u2013 and those who would like to join the middle class \u2013  is their path to victory. Recognizing some of his last campaign\u2019s mistakes, Romney \u2013 who\u2019s now telling Republicans he\u2019s considering another run in 2016 \u2013 is saying he\u2019d like to make lifting wages a centerpiece of his next bid. He told the Republican National Committee on Friday in San Diego that he\u2019d fight the \u201cscourge of poverty\u201d if he ran again. \u201cI believe in the post-Obama era we need to stand for safety, and for opportunity for all people, and we have to stand for helping lift people out of poverty,\u201d Romney said. The Democratic push to narrow the income gap \u2013 and take on financial institutions and Wall Street while doing it \u2013 is also being driven by Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who tweaked Romney in a tweet Sunday, highlighting the GOP\u2019s vulnerability. Good to see Mitt Romney suddenly talking about working families. Are corporations still people too, Mitt? Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, who\u2019s considering a 2016 bid, blasted Obama\u2019s proposal in an appearance on \u201cFace the Nation.\u201d \u201cThe notion first of all that in order for some people to do better, someone has to do worse is just not true. Raising taxes on people that are successful is not going to make people that are struggling more successful,\u201d he said. Rubio said he supports the broad thrust of some of Obama\u2019s ideas, like reforming higher education. But Obama\u2019s plan, he said, would pour more money into a \u201cbroken, existing system,\u201d rather than creating more competition and alternative certification programs. \u201cI wish he would spend more time on that, and less time trying to raise taxes and pour money into an outdated model that no longer works in the twenty first century,\u201d Rubio said. Chaffetz: Obama's tax plan a 'non-starter' Other congressional Republicans were similarly critical. On CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union,\u201d Rep. Jason Chaffetz, R-Utah, chairman of the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee, called the President\u2019s tax proposal \u201ca non-starter.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re not just one good tax increase away from prosperity in this nation,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have to make sure that we get a regulatory environment that\u2019s predictable, that we bring those tax rates down and that we quit spending this money that we don\u2019t have.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Republicans believe world turmoil undermines Obama But GOP yet to resolve its own argument on national security Bush, Rubio, slam Obama approach Republicans are sensing that a world seemingly spinning out of control could give them an opening to reclaim their traditional strength on national security issues heading into the 2016 presidential election. Dramatic video of killings hostage raid in market Even before terrorists killed 12 people at a Paris magazine this week, Republicans were fine-tuning an assault on President Barack Obama\u2019s foreign policy as timid and naive, and stumbling everywhere from the deserts of Syria to the Kremlin in Moscow. But one of the brothers who carried out the Paris strike spent several months in Yemen in 2011, according to U.S. officials, receiving weapons training and working with al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula. That could undermine Obama\u2019s proud claim of dismantling al Qaeda\u2019s \u201ccore\u201d and put Democrats on the defensive \u2013 especially Hillary Clinton, who carried out the President\u2019s foreign policy as his first-term Secretary of State. \u201cThere are big opportunities for Republicans to reclaim their traditional voter advantage on national security,\u201d said Kori Schake, a former National Security Council, and State Department official in the George W. Bush White House. \u201cTo most Americans, the world feels like a dangerous place right now. Six years into (the) Obama administration, it is difficult for President Obama to blame that on anybody but himself.\u201d READ: 3 terrorists dead Until 2008, Republicans enjoyed a perception among voters for several decades that they \u2013 and not Democrats \u2013 were best suited to lead America\u2019s national security policy. But Obama reversed that conceit by arguing that former President George W. Bush squandered global goodwill after the September 11 attacks with a unilateralist foreign policy, the invasion of Iraq and \u201ctough talk\u201d that alienated US allies. \u201cWe are the party of Roosevelt. We are the party of Kennedy. So don\u2019t tell me that Democrats won\u2019t defend this country. Don\u2019t tell me that Democrats won\u2019t keep us safe,\u201d Obama told Americans as he accepted his party\u2019s 2008 nomination. How were the suspects able to flee from Paris? Four years later, Obama turned a similar trick, brandishing his leadership in hunting down al-Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden and ending the war in Iraq. The President painted Republican Mitt Romney as a vacillating hawk who wanted to return to endless war and taunted his opponent over his anti-Russia rhetoric by suggesting \u201cthe 1980s are now calling to ask for their foreign policy back.\u201d Foreign policy as an issue is rarely decisive in presidential elections \u2013 at least once a candidate has managed to convince voters he or she is up to being commander-in-chief. But a chaotic global environment which defies U.S. efforts to exert control \u2013 even if it is not all the fault of the sitting president \u2013 is rarely good news for the party in control of the White House and key players in the Republican national security establishment believe that foreign policy could feature especially prominently in the coming election. Potential candidates like Sen. Marco Rubio and Rand Paul have been quick to spot the political potential of such an environment heading into the 2016 race \u2013 and are already waging their own internal duel over the party\u2019s national security message. Broadly, the establishment Republican critique of Obama is that far from his promise to reestablish American leadership, he has instead presided over an era of disengagement from the world. READ: Paris attack: The new terror Republicans complain Obama is happier chatting to foreign dictators of longtime U.S. enemies such as Iran and Cuba than traditional American allies like Saudi Arabia, the Gulf states or even European powers. And they claim that Obama\u2019s deliberate \u2013 critics would say hesitant \u2013 brand of global leadership on issues like Syria has deepened the global crisis and abdicated U.S. leadership. Of all the potential Republican candidates, Rubio has developed the most sweeping case against Obama\u2019s foreign policy, as he has sought to frame himself as a statesman-in-waiting after four years in the Senate. He warned in a Daily Caller op-ed in November that Obama \u201cpeeps timidly from behind an ever-thinning curtain of American strength, watching idly as new and resurgent forces challenge global order. READ: U.S. lawmakers, officials see threat at home \u201cEven as an increasingly hostile Russia threatens a new cold war, President Obama uses baby-steps and half-measures in defense of our allies, our principles, and our people, when he acts at all,\u201d Rubio said, using the 25th anniversary of the fall of the Berlin Wall to paint himself as the heir to Ronald Reagan\u2019s foreign policy legacy. Rubio\u2019s fellow Floridian Jeb Bush has yet to lay out his foreign policy since moves to explore a possible presidential campaign, other than to slam Obama\u2019s plan to reestablish diplomatic relations with Cuba. But he signaled in a Wall Street Journal forum late last year that he would associate himself with the traditional Republican orthodoxy on foreign policy. In general terms, that means more defense spending and robust US rhetoric backed up by action \u2013 an approach likely shared by other possible Republican candidates including Texas Gov. Rick Perry and New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie. Bush also believes that America\u2019s role in the world will become an increasingly potent campaign issue. \u201cSix months ago, I would have said it might be a continuing of the focus on domestic issues because they are big and they are challenging,\u201d he said at the forum. \u201cBut there is a growing awareness that we can\u2019t withdraw from the world. There is an unraveling taking place.\u201d He added: \u201cI do think that foreign policy and maybe a reevaluation of what the role is of the United States in the world will become is important.\u201d Before they go after Obama however, Republicans have to get their own story straight on foreign policy as a debate plays out by traditional national security hawks and a more nuanced stance embodied by Paul. The Kentucky Senator, who comes from the libertarian tradition, has been keen to dispel perceptions that he is an isolationist as he considers how to build a coalition that could lead to the Republican nomination. But he still stands for a restrained use of US military force overseas. He explains that he backed the use of force against al Qaeda after the Sept.11, 2001, attacks, but opposes a continued long-term U.S. engagement in Afghanistan. \u201cYes, we need a hammer ready, but not every civil war is a nail,\u201d he said in a major foreign policy speech in October. \u201cWe need a foreign policy that recognized our limits, preserves our might and a common sense conservative realism of strength and action.\u201d There is an irony to the coming Republican assault on Obama\u2019s foreign policy, because it mimics the strategy the president himself used to pave the way to the White House. But it isn\u2019t a given that Republicans hopes of exploiting a national security meltdown abroad will pan out because the opening exchanges of a presidential campaign are often a poor guide to the themes and issues that will decide it. If, for instance, the current economic bounce back fizzles, the plight of the middle class could outweigh all other issues. \u201cIt\u2019s a heck of a long time, there is plenty of time for domestic issues to return and be number one,\u201d said Peter Feaver, a former National Security Council official for George W. Bush and Bill Clinton, now with Duke University. \u201cBut on the other hand it does seem likely that foreign policy will seem even more salient in 2016 than it was in 2012.\u201d And Obama can still claim to have crushed the leadership of al Qaeda in tribal regions of Pakistan and Afghanistan, and waged a largely covert drone war against extremists elsewhere. He sees his presidency as a historic mission to move America on from the post-Sept. 11 period of constant war and to chart a sustainable strategy to fight extremism. Any GOP candidate using foreign policy as a cudgel to attack against what will likely become known as the \u201cObama-Clinton\u201d foreign policy, must deal with one large elephant in the room \u2013 George W. Bush. There is little public appetite for the era of intervention that characterized Bush\u2019s presidency and Republicans face the task of winning back public trust. But Schake said any Republican running on a foreign policy platform would be able to acknowledge the faults of the last Republican presidency, while refocusing on the presidency of Obama. There are \u201clegitimate criticisms of Bush administration foreign policy, but (they) are hard to sustain after eight years of a Democratic presidency,\u201d she said.",

            "article_content": "Hillary Clinton is the former first lady of Arkansas But Arkansas might not be friendly to Clinton if she runs for president Clinton's challenge reflects broader political changes in the South This state launched the Clinton brand two decades ago and handed Hillary Clinton one of the biggest victories of her 2008 primary battle against Barack Obama. But as she considers another bid for the White House in 2016, Arkansas isn\u2019t so friendly. In the final weeks of the 2014 election, top Democrats in Arkansas told Hillary Clinton and her associates that she wasn\u2019t welcome to stump for the party\u2019s candidates in the state, according to a knowledgeable source. While there were some in Arkansas who wanted her to come, the \u201cstay away\u201d contingent won the argument and Hillary Clinton was left to raise money for Sen. Mark Pryor from New York. Bill Clinton made up for the absence, making 13 stops in the state during campaign season imploring voters to not make the election a repudiation of President Barack Obama. Did 2014 election help or hurt Hillary? Still, Democrats across Arkansas lost big. The governor\u2019s mansion flipped red, along with Pryor\u2019s Senate seat. The state\u2019s four-member House delegation is solidly Republican. READ: Hillary Clinton has a 49 point lead in New Hampshire The rout was part of a broader repudiation of Democrats across the South this election cycle. But the results in Arkansas were particularly tough for the Clintons and raise questions about whether the state most associated with the couple is no longer welcome territory ahead of Hillary Clinton\u2019s potential 2016 race. \u201cThe coattails were short,\u201d outgoing Democratic Gov. Mike Beebe told CNN. \u201cIt is a fact.\u201d Bill Clinton handily won Arkansas during both of his presidential elections. But the politics of the South changed during his time in office as many states were increasingly dominated by Republicans. Arkansas was a genuine battleground state during the 2000 election, when Al Gore and George W. Bush both campaigned here and spent money on television ads. Seeking to distance himself from Bill Clinton after his impeachment, Gore didn\u2019t campaign with the former President and lost Arkansas to Bush by 5 points. By 2008, Arkansas was seen as so unfriendly to Democrats that Obama wrote the state off \u2013 even as he won other southern states like North Carolina and Virginia that Republicans carried for decades. Before the 2014 election, Hillary Clinton\u2019s supporters \u2013 many at the grassroots level in Arkansas \u2013 would quietly talk about the former first lady\u2019s chances of competing and winning Arkansas in 2016. They touted her standing with white women and working class voters. Should voters on left 'Stop Hillary'? But after Election Day, those optimistic Democrats are harder to find. \u201cLimited,\u201d said Vincent Insalaco, the chair of the Arkansas Democratic Party, when asked about Hillary Clinton\u2019s chances of winning the state. \u201cIt is limited here in Arkansas.\u201d \u201cI think she could run a strong race here, but I think the electorate has changed,\u201d said Clarke Tucker, a newly elected Democratic state representative. \u201cThe state has changed.\u201d READ: Hillary Clinton could end up alone in Iowa Hillary Clinton moved to Arkansas in 1974, joining her soon-to-be husband, Bill, who was already a rising political star in the state. The couple would go on to dominate the state\u2019s politics for the better part of two decades and left a long list of confidants \u2013 known as FOBs or Friends of Bill \u2013 in key Democratic positions across the state. But times have changed. Republican power bases in northwest Arkansas have grown, religious conservatives are a powerful voting bloc and the state\u2019s Latino population has yet to become a force at the ballot box. \u201cArkansas is a real demographic nightmare for Democrats,\u201d said Andrew Dowdle, the vice chair of political science at the University of Arkansas. \u201cIt is a complete reversal of fortunes.\u201d All of this complicates the idea that Hillary Clinton could win Arkansas in 2016. During the 2008 primary, Hillary Clinton dominated Obama, winning 70% of the state, her largest victory during that year\u2019s primary fight. That was the only time she has been on the ballot in the state, however, and was a contest with just Democratic voters. Democrats' 2016 contenders The 2014 exit polls in Arkansas weren\u2019t positive for Hillary Clinton, either. Thirty-nine percent of voters said she would make a good president, according to the exit polls. Fifty-six percent said she would not. Those same exit polls found that former GOP Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, who is also considering a 2016 run, is seen as a better presidential option in the state than Hillary Clinton. Fifty percent of voters in Arkansas said he would be a good president, compared to 46% who said he wouldn\u2019t. READ: Dems eye New York, Philadelphia, Columbus for 2016 convention With the former first lady eyeing another run at the presidency in 2016, Democrats and Arkansas experts said that while she would easily win the Democratic primary, she would struggle mightily to overcome what has become a changed state. Democrats in Arkansas blame Obama \u2013 not the Clintons \u2013 for their losses. One reason Beebe, the outgoing governor, sees things getting better for Democrats in 2016 and beyond is because \u201cObama will be gone.\u201d \u201cI think it is all Obama,\u201d Beebe said. \u201cI don\u2019t think there is any question that most folks feel like it was a repudiation of the president and the president\u2019s policies. But I think it is cyclical and the reason I say that is if you look at the history.\u201d Hillary Clinton out-campaigns Obama \u201cDemocrats are looking at what can she do different from Barack Obama,\u201d said Dowdle. \u201cIf you are a Democratic party activist, you would end up hoping she would win white women. \u2026 That idea that a woman candidate could end up running and making the gap grow is not going to happen.\u201d Exit polls show that Beebe is partly right: Nearly 70% of voters in Arkansas said they disapprove of Obama. Only 30% said they were satisfied with him. For Inalasco, 2016 \u2013 and a Hillary Clinton run - is a moment to rebuild. \u201cI would hope that she would carry Arkansas,\u201d he said, rejecting the idea that Democrats are done in the state. \u201cBut if she runs it is so, so positive for us on the local level, here, for what we can do with her popularity.\u201d As for whether the Clinton magic is gone in Arkansas, Inalasco deferred his answer for two years. \u201cI guess,\u201d he said, \u201cwe will see what happens in 2016, won\u2019t we?\u201d",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Paul Waldman is a senior writer with the American Prospect, a left-leaning magazine, and a blogger for The Washington Post. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. Paul Waldman: Jeb Bush's comment about GOP not giving blacks \"free stuff\" is not so much a gaffe as statement of Republican belief He says that oddly, GOP does not believe upper classes are morally compromised when the government helps pay their mortgage interest Waldman: Mortgage interest is entitlement costing U.S. nearly $70 billion a year. Conservative view: Poor people bring it on themselves It wouldn\u2019t be a presidential campaign if we didn\u2019t eventually hear a wealthy Republican candidate contemptuously dismiss the unwashed masses for reaching out their endlessly grasping fingers for government largesse, and Jeb Bush has now obliged. At an appearance in South Carolina on Thursday, Bush was asked how Republicans could appeal to black voters. \u201cOur message is one of hope and aspiration,\u201d he replied. \u201cIt isn\u2019t one of division and \u2018Get in line, and we\u2019ll take care of you with free stuff.\u2019 \u201c Let\u2019s be clear about one thing: Bush shouldn\u2019t be criticized for a \u201cgaffe,\u201d that common and tiresome genre of campaign microcontroversy in which a candidate says something in a way he wishes he hadn\u2019t and his opponents and the media act as though he has revealed the true and hidden darkness within his soul. This isn\u2019t really about Jeb Bush so much as it is about the persistence of this idea, one that comes out again and again when candidates are speaking to conservatives and the topic of certain kinds of Americans comes up. It\u2019s not even about the size of government or the nature of the welfare state as much as it is about who benefits from government and how our ideas about those benefits are shaped by the people we think are getting them. Whatever Bush actually believes, there\u2019s no doubt that when many Republican voters hear about \u201cfree stuff,\u201d they have a particular picture in their minds: poor people, probably black or brown, getting some benefit they didn\u2019t deserve, paid for by \u201cus,\u201d the hard-working and upstanding Americans. Republicans will tend to mirror those views back at the Republican audiences they\u2019re trying to persuade. You no doubt remember Mitt Romney\u2019s assertion about the 47% of Americans who pay no income tax and \u201cbelieve that they are entitled to health care, to food, to housing, to you name it.\u201d   You may have forgotten that after the 2012 election, Romney blamed his loss on the fact that President Barack Obama had given \u201cgifts\u201d to various groups such as African-Americans, Hispanics and young people, gaining their loyalty with handouts. In other words, free stuff. Other Republicans agree, not just that that safety net programs are gifts to the undeserving, but that they\u2019re morally corrupting to the people who get them. So Paul Ryan, ahead of the 2012 election, warned that things such as food stamps should be cut, lest we \u201cturn the safety net into a hammock that lulls able-bodied people to lives of dependency and complacency.\u201d Just think of those fortunate poor people, complacently lolling about in their hammocks! Romney defends his '47%' comment Yet oddly enough, no one suggests that middle or upper class people are morally compromised when the government helps pay their mortgage interest \u2013 an enormous entitlement costing nearly $70 billion a year. The truth is that compared with most of our peer countries, we are enormously stingy with \u201cfree stuff.\u201d Citizens in much of Europe can avail themselves of generous paid family leave, free child care, free university education and inexpensive (and universal) health coverage, all paid for through taxes. The result is societies that have significantly lower inequality than we do, not because they aren\u2019t capitalist (they are) but because government policy ameliorates the inequality that unfettered capitalism brings. Among the 34 advanced nations in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, the United States ranks 10th in inequality, looking just at incomes, but second in inequality, trailing only Chile, after taxes and transfers (i.e. social welfare benefits) are taken into account. Combine that with our almost demented commitment to working as many hours as possible and avoiding vacations, and you have a nation where people work extremely hard and long but find it extremely difficult to get ahead. Yet Republicans politicians continue to tell Americans that we suffer from an epidemic of laziness. If people would only put their nose the grindstones, they could be as wealthy and successful as someone like Jeb Bush. So why do Republicans say this \u201cfree stuff\u201d kind of thing so often? The main reason is the simplest one: they believe it. Beyond that, it serves to justify the prevailing distribution of income, wealth and privileges. If we can believe this narrative \u2013 that the one percent got where it is through nothing more than its hard work and strength of character, and that those who are struggling financially are in that position only because of their sloth and moral deficiency \u2013 then there\u2019s no need to change anything about how our system works. You don\u2019t need to criticize Jeb Bush for a \u201cgaffe\u201d \u2013 look at his policy proposals, and it becomes clear that like most everyone in his party, he wants to reward those who are already at the top, and give those at the bottom a stern lecture about how certain kinds of \u201cfree stuff\u201d will corrupt their spirit and keep them from clawing their way up. It\u2019s a wonder that people find this argument insulting. Join us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion.Read CNNOpinion\u2019s Flipboard magazine.",

The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. Castellanos: Ben Carson's rise is impressive, but no one else has shown strength vs. Trump on GOP side He says Democrats need a stronger candidate than Hillary Clinton; Biden would do well with some groups opposed to Clinton The 2016 race is set to take off after Labor Day.  I hope Republicans have as many voters as candidates.  A few observations on where the race stands today: 1.  Hillary Clinton has a high (80%) favorable rating among Democrats.  In politics, however, things are not always as they appear.  Politicians, like people, have antibodies, strong supporters who rush to their aid when they are wounded.  Hillary\u2019s support is, in part, indicative of her failing political health.  Even with high favorables, she is sinking. 2. In 1976, the country song of the year was \u201cDon\u2019t the Girls All Get Prettier at Closing Time,\u201d by Mickey Gilley. Clinton is the only serious Democratic candidate at the bar.  Democrats have no choice but to rate her favorably, unless someone else shows up before closing time. 3. Imagine Joe Biden\u2019s announcement.  There wouldn\u2019t be a dry eye in America. 18 things I've learned about unicorns, Donald Trump and 2016 4. Joe Biden is a stronger general election candidate than Hillary Clinton.  He appeals to white, working-class males, \u201cReagan Democrats,\u201d and Clinton doesn\u2019t.  Biden was also loyal to the first black president for eight tough years and would energize the Democratic base more than Clinton. 5. Joe Biden is a much better politician than Hillary Clinton.  As Bruce Haynes recently noted, \u201cBiden has been sinking every putt.\u201d His visit with Elizabeth Warren to explore her interest in the 2016 ticket was political brilliance. 6. Republicans now have a better shot at beating Hillary Clinton than Joe Biden.  She is yesterday\u2019s Democrat.  I hope Biden doesn\u2019t run. Can GOP trust Donald Trump? 7. Elizabeth Warren knows Bernie Sanders is not going to be the Democratic nominee.  She has an opportunity to regain leadership of the income-inequality movement she founded and to energize the Democratic ticket if she runs as VP with Biden. 8. Elizabeth Warren gets a free-throw:  She is not up for re-election in 2016. 9. The candidate growing on the Republican side is not Donald Trump but Dr. Ben Carson.  Trump, in fact, has stopped growing.  In a two-man race in the Monmouth Poll, Carson beats Trump by nearly 20 points.  Republicans want a conservative outsider more than they want an outsider with no core beliefs. 10. However, in the same poll, Trump, the outsider, beats all the insiders, Jeb Bush, Scott Walker, Ted Cruz and Marco Rubio.  Unless one of them grows as an outsider, Trump could be the nominee. Is Donald Trump right about taxing the rich? 11. On March 15, the GOP nomination process moves to winner take all contests in Florida, North Carolina, Ohio and Missouri.  If Trump is still No. 1 in a crowded field mid-March, The Donald could take a big lead. 12. The race restarts after Labor Day.  Candidates who can\u2019t flood the airwaves with great positive TV ads in Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina will begin to fade. 13. The September 16 CNN debate will be the most pivotal point remaining in this race.  The dynamic will be reversed:  In the first debate, the upstart, Trump, emerged as the alternative to the establishment.  In the CNN debate, Bush, Walker, Rubio, John Kasich and Carly Fiorina will be fighting to emerge as \u201cthe\u201d conservative alternative to Trump. 14. Can insiders Rubio, Bush, Kasich or Walker establish themselves as conservative outsiders?  Tough, but yes, they can. Ronald Reagan remained an outsider, a leader who brought change to the establishment, even after he\u2019d been President eight years. Donald Trump signs loyalty GOP pledge 15. Can Fiorina or Carson become the conservative/outsider alternative to Trump?  Yes, they can. Carson already is and has room to grow.  This debate is pivotal for Carson and Fiorina. 16. Fiorina has smartly pegged herself as the unique alternative to Hillary Clinton.  With Clinton\u2019s decline, however, Fiorina could fade, unless she becomes more than an alternative to Clinton. 17. In the royal courts of Europe, the King always had a religious counselor, a wise man, who was the keeper of core beliefs.  Ben Carson is that shaman.  He is the crystalline distillation of conservative belief. Dick Cheney: My bet is Joe will run 18. That\u2019s why voters are turning to Carson now. Eventually, however, Republicans will select a candidate who will put those principles to work.  Carson needs to grow or remain the wise man, not the King. 19. Ted Cruz is toast.  He is waiting outside a door that will never open.  Carson, Trump, and Fiorina aren\u2019t going anywhere and they are genuine outsiders.  Cruz will continue to be Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cChester,\u201d the subservient Looney-Tunes sidekick who drooled, \u201cSpike is my hero, because he\u2019s so big and strong.\u201d 20. At some point, even Cruz will figure that out.  He will turn on Trump.  Then, Trump will murder him. 21. If Donald Trump ever says he likes one of his opponents or that he\u2019s \u201ca nice guy,\u201d that candidate better head for the fallout shelter.  It\u2019s the equivalent of being asked to stand on a plastic sheet in an abandoned underground garage after midnight.  The hit man is coming. Dr. Ben Carson on State of the Union: Full Interview 22. We can hear Trump now:  \u201cI like Ted Cruz.  I don\u2019t know why he came to sit at my feet, though he\u2019s a nice guy.  But he talks like a girl. Doesn\u2019t he talk like a girl?  Maybe its because he\u2019s a loser who\u2019s never done anything.\u201d 23. Without Fiorina at the kid\u2019s table debate, there is little reason to watch.  CNN should turn the early debate into a playoff game:  The winner gets to continue to the big-boy\u2019s debate.  It\u2019s the right thing to do and would deliver higher ratings. 24. I suspect Donald Trump\u2019s favorite Bible verse might be Genesis 1:1.  \u201cIn the beginning, Trump created Trump.  And it was fantastic.\u201d Join us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion.Read CNNOpinion\u2019s Flipboard magazine.",

I started my career filing and answering the phones as a secretary in a nine-person real estate firm.  Being underestimated is nothing new for me. I don\u2019t shy away from a challenge. I am proud of what we were able to accomplish at Hewlett-Packard during the worst technology recession in 25 years. While other tech companies like Sun Microsystems  and Gateway Computers  collapsed around us, we weathered the dot-com bust and came out stronger. Other tech companies did not foresee how the market would change and refused to make the tough choices needed to survive until it was too late. It is 15 years later and only this summer did the tech-heavy NASDAQ recover to its precrash high. Hillary Clinton's career in the spotlight Hewlett-Packard not only survived the dot-com bust, but we also became the leader in every market segment and product category in which we competed. We doubled revenue to over $80 billion. We quadrupled the growth rate to 6.5%. We tripled innovation to produce an average of 15 patents a day. Before I joined, Hewlett-Packard\u2019s operating expenses had jumped by 18% while earnings dropped 12%.  We had transformed the company from a lurching bureaucracy into an agile, tech industry leader. As a result, Hewlett-Packard grew from the 28th to 11th largest company in the United States during my tenure. The toughest call that a CEO has to make is to tell an honest, hard-working employee that for a company to survive there is no longer a job for him or her. That is a hard choice. At Hewlett-Packard, those decisions saved 140,000 jobs  and allowed HP to grow to 300,000 employees today. The left has tried to attack me because I was fired from Hewlett-Packard. Yes, I was fired in a boardroom brawl, which I\u2019ve been up front about since the day it happened. I was fired because I challenged the status quo. It is what leaders must do. When you lead and when you challenge the status quo, you make enemies. It\u2019s why Steve Jobs, Oprah Winfrey, Walt Disney and Mike Bloomberg  have all been fired. Real change is never easy because the people who have benefited from the status quo want to preserve the status quo. Who's running for President? And yet, my tenure was longer than the median tenure of a Fortune 500 CEO. In business, unlike politics, the numbers and the facts are clear. There is no spin room when you report earnings, just numbers and facts that anyone can download and evaluate. As the CEO of a publicly traded company, I could be held criminally liable for reporting false results.  Wouldn\u2019t it be amazing if politicians were held to this same standard? I\u2019m sure Democrats and the Clinton Machine will continue to use empty talking points and bumper sticker rhetoric against me because they know Hillary Clinton is the status quo. She is the epitome of a professional political class that has managed a bloated, inept, corrupt federal government for far too long. Most Americans think we should shrink the size of the federal government and ensure that it is competent at its core functions. The progressive notion that government is the answer to our problems has time and again failed. As hundreds of thousands of baby boomers begin to retire from the federal bureaucracy, I would not replace them. I am running on my track record because it demonstrates the type of leadership that I will bring to Washington: the resolve to make tough calls, the fortitude to challenge the status quo, and the character never to lie to the American people. Margaret Thatcher once said she was not content to manage the decline of a great nation.  Neither am I. We need a president who will answer every question and face every challenge. The political class may continue to attack my record. I have named many accomplishments. Why won\u2019t Hillary Clinton name one? Join us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion.

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: J. Matthew McInnis is a resident fellow at the American Enterprise Institute and the former senior expert on Iran at the U.S. Central Command. Andrew J. Bowen is a senior fellow and the director of Middle East Studies at the Center for the National Interest. The views in this article are those of the authors and do not reflect the official policy or position of the Defense Department or U.S. government. Negotiators reached landmark deal over Iran's nuclear program Obama making risky bet on Iran's intentions, authors say President Barack Obama\u2019s achievement of a nuclear deal with Iran, and his optimism about an opening with this longtime opponent of Washington, has been compared to President Richard Nixon\u2019s historic opening with China and his d\u00e9tente with the Soviet Union. It\u2019s ironic, then, that Nixon\u2019s foreign policy architect, Henry Kissinger, concluded this spring that an opening with Iran on the current terms isn\u2019t one he would have signed off on. As Mark Twain is said to have observed, \u201cHistory doesn\u2019t repeat itself, but it does rhyme.\u201d With this in mind, President Obama should remember that while historical analogies to China and Russia are seductive, events may rhyme in ways he doesn\u2019t anticipate. Obama is making the risky bet that in the next decade, as Iran opens up economically and diplomatic exchanges thicken, Tehran\u2019s leadership will shift away from its post-1979 ideological confrontation with the United States and embrace engagement and cooperation. This opening will empower an Iranian Deng Xiaoping or Mikhail Gorbachev who will conclude that sacrificing Iran\u2019s integration into the global economy is too high of price for Tehran to pay in pursuit of destabilizing policies in the region and a future nuclear weapon. Iran\u2019s hardliners, meanwhile, will be consigned to the shadows and a new generation will rise up. If this is how Iran\u2019s next decade plays out, Obama\u2019s bet will have paid off. But betting on an internal transformation is risky. After all, Ayatollah Khamenei and the surrounding dark state \u2013 the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps and their vast industries \u2013 aren\u2019t malleable for real change. And the Green Revolution of 2009 \u2013 the urban moderate uprising \u2013 should have reminded Washington of the ancien regime\u2019s resilience. True, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani has support among sections of the urban elite, the middle class and the younger generation, who seek a more economically open and engaged Iran. But his position is severely constrained by the conservative leadership and the coercive elements of the Islamic Republic. If internal changes come, the effects are never clear-cut or predictable. For example, a special election earlier this year surprised many observers by naming hardliner Ayatollah Mohammad Yazdi as chairman of the Assembly of Experts instead of, as many had expected, a representative of Iran\u2019s moderates. This assembly will choose Iran\u2019s next supreme leader. Dominated by a conservative, prospects for liberal post-Khamenei reform are bleak. A safer bet would be to take the supreme leader\u2019s words and actions at face value. As evidenced by Khamenei\u2019s numerous pre- and post-nuclear deal statements, this week\u2019s agreement is simply a transaction. Ayatollah Khamenei secured economic sanction relief in exchange for merely postponing the development of his country\u2019s nuclear program until after 2025. In addition, the deal\u2019s terms do not address other areas of difference with Washington, including the imprisonment of Americans still languishing in Iran\u2019s jails or a change in Tehran\u2019s regional behavior. The reality is that opposing the United States is at the heart of the Islamic Republic\u2019s ideology that Ayatollah Khomeini and his successor, Ayatollah Khamenei, have cultivated for over 30 years. This ideology has noticeably manifested itself in both hostile rhetoric and terrorist attacks against the United States and its allies. Khamenei and his successors are unlikely to break from this ideology, which has underwritten the legitimacy of their regime. Khamenei, then, is unlikely to be seeking a partnership with the United States, and Washington presently has little leverage for encouraging future cooperation. Why? For a start, the nuclear agreement offers Tehran few positive incentives for bilateral engagement, and instead rewards the Supreme Leader for his unilateral, rejectionist foreign and domestic policies. The agreement completely unshackles Iran\u2019s government from United Nations restrictions on building up its arms and missile arsenals within a decade, and will allow Iran to expand its nuclear program after 15 years. Also, the U.S. Treasury\u2019s financial tools to counter Iran\u2019s behavior will be significantly handicapped even as economic sanction relief will provide a windfall of $150 billion of frozen funds and new economic investment. This opens the potential for post-deal revenues to be used for supporting proxies, partners, and allies from Sana\u2019a to Damascus. Moving forward, Khamenei can be expected to jealously guard the opening up of Iran\u2019s economy to prevent too much Western influence in the country\u2019s domestic affairs. More broadly, the Supreme Leader will likely use this economic boost to try to achieve his long-term objectives in the region, including pushing the United States out of the Middle East by further developing the country\u2019s armed forces, which will make it more and more dangerous for the United States to maintain a military presence in the Persian Gulf. Such moves will take place against a backdrop that already sees Tehran boxing in Saudi Arabia with expanded interference in Yemen, Bahrain, the Eastern Province, Iraq, Syria, and Lebanon. And, of course, Khamenei continues to challenge Israel\u2019s survival through the arming and financing of Lebanese Hezbollah and terrorist groups in the Palestinian territories. With all this in mind, it\u2019s hard to see then why President Obama is so optimistic about establishing a d\u00e9tente with Iran. At the core, d\u00e9tente is a two-way endeavor, and while Washington may see the value of engaging a broader set of states in the region to confront common challenges, Tehran clearly has a very different end state in mind for the Middle East. Believing that Iran could be a long-term partner in confronting ISIS or securing Syria\u2019s future fails to look beyond the surface in understanding Iran\u2019s true motivations. Washington policymakers would be wise to use these next  10 years to support America\u2019s allies in the region and find new ways to contain Iran and its regional behavior before all constraints on its behavior are abandoned.

She\u2019s also the author of \u201cThe Labour Legacy: Curtin, Chifley, Whitlam, Hawke\u201d and \u201cGoverning Change: From Keating to Howard.\u201d The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. CNN is showcasing the work of The Conversation, a collaboration between journalists and academics to provide news analysis and commentary. The content is produced solely by The Conversation Australian Opposition leader has proposed a change to the Marriage Act Proposal could see Australia catch up with other countries on same-sex marriage Issue has been politicized in Australia by successive governments More than 20 countries have now legalized same-sex marriage. Ireland\u2019s recent constitutional referendum vote in favor makes Australia look particularly backward in comparison with most other developed, English-speaking countries. Canada, New Zealand and the United Kingdom \u2013 though excluding Northern Ireland \u2013 have also introduced same-sex marriage. The majority of American states now have same-sex marriage. The U.S. Supreme Court is expected to hand down a decision this year that may confirm whether same-sex marriage is constitutionally protected. So, as Opposition Leader Bill Shorten introduces an amendment to the Marriage Act to legalize same-sex marriage, why has Australia lagged so far behind? The question seems all the more perplexing because the Australian federal parliament has the power to introduce same-sex marriage. That means implementing same-sex marriage is a relatively simple matter in Australia \u2013 unlike in the U.S., for example, where there were separate struggles to introduce it in multiple states. Similarly, there is no marriage clause in the Australian Constitution that requires changing \u2013 unlike in Ireland. The answer to why Australia hasn\u2019t already introduced same-sex marriage partly lies in the way in which the issue has been exploited in Australian electoral politics. There was no definition of marriage in Australian federal legislation that specified which sexes could marry. But in 2004, then-prime minister John Howard introduced legislation banning same-sex marriage. Undoubtedly, Howard personally opposed same-sex marriage. However, he also hoped that he could use \u201cvalues\u201d issues in the 2004 election to wedge socially conservative religious voters away from Labor. Howard implied that Labor had betrayed its suburban, working-class heartland to support the politically correct views of inner-city elites. This was a conservative framing that conveniently overlooked many gays and lesbians also being workers. Despite some internal dissent, the power of right-wing factions within the ALP won out. Labor voted with the Howard government to ban same-sex marriage. It feared losing key electorates in areas such as western Sydney. For years, it was left to minor parties such as the Democrats and the Greens to make the public case for same-sex marriage. Unlike the U.S., where party discipline is less tight, the requirement to toe the party line forced prominent Labor supporters of same-sex marriage to publicly state the ALP\u2019s official position. The Howard-era legislation banning same-sex marriage was also harder to challenge because Australia does not have a bill or charter of rights. The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms played a significant role in bringing in same-sex marriage. Similarly, in the U.S., gay and lesbian activists used legal challenges to laws prohibiting marriage at state level. Such rights litigation was not an option in Australia. Rather, gay and lesbian activists had to rely on trying to change major party politicians\u2019 views. This was not easy. More moderate conservative leaders in other countries, such as David Cameron in the UK and John Key in New Zealand, eventually supported same-sex marriage. Meanwhile, Howard \u2013 and later Tony Abbott \u2013 used socially conservative, religious \u201cvalues\u201d arguments to try to wedge off Labor votes. In the 2007 election, then-opposition leader Kevin Rudd supported the legal recognition of same-sex relationships as being equivalent to heterosexual, de facto partnerships. But he also used his opposition to same-sex marriage to reassure socially conservative, religious voters. Julia Gillard did the same. It wasn\u2019t until 2011 that the long struggle within the ALP finally resulted in a change to the party platform to support same-sex marriage. In 2013 \u2013 prior to his return to the prime ministership \u2013 Rudd shifted too. He announced that he now supported same-sex marriage on the grounds that it was legitimate for the state and the church to have different policies on marriage in a secular society. Had Labor\u2019s support for same-sex marriage been a binding vote \u2013 as was the case with opposing same-sex marriage or with the introduction of the 2008 reforms legally recognizing same-sex relationships \u2013 the Labor government could have been close to having the numbers to introduce same-sex marriage during the Gillard or second Rudd government. However, Labor MPs were granted a conscience vote. That conscience vote indicates that the separation between religion and the state is not yet fully accepted in Australian politics. Labor policy had left the question of whom religious organizations should marry, which is clearly an issue of religious conscience, for religious bodies themselves to decide according to their (varied) beliefs. Labor MPs were effectively being granted a religious conscience vote on the issue of whom the state should be able to marry in a country where currently 72.5% of couples who marry choose to have a civil rather than religious ceremony. State-sanctioned same-sex marriage was still being framed partly as a personal morality issue rather than predominantly as an equality issue. By introducing a bill before this year\u2019s party conference, Shorten appears to have headed off a push for a binding vote for Labor MPs. The residual religious framing is one of the reasons same-sex marriage has not yet been introduced in Australia. It has proved much easier (and quicker) to introduce in countries that have predominantly constructed same-sex marriage as an equality issue, such as Canada. Ireland\u2019s referendum vote is so important because it demonstrates that, even in a country that is traditionally staunchly Catholic, the majority of voters understand that religious definitions of marriage should be confined to religious marriage ceremonies and not be imposed on the state\u2019s definition of marriage. Most Labor politicians in Australia now take that position too. This includes some MPs who were previously concerned about the impact of same-sex marriage on their seats, such as Chris Bowen, Tony Burke and Ed Husic \u2013 all of whom occupy western Sydney electorates. Meanwhile, many Liberals are urging that they should be granted a conscience vote on legalizing same-sex marriage. They are likely to be given one. Previously, Liberal MPs haven\u2019t had a choice over whether same-sex marriage is constructed as an issue of equal rights for loving adults \u2013 it has only been constructed as a Howard-era values/morality issue. The Liberals now risk having same-sex marriage used against them electorally just as they once tried to use it against Labor. Shorten suggested that Abbott is: \u201c\u2026 stopping Australia becoming a modern nation.\u201d Labor\u2019s moves prompted Abbott to argue that any decision to legalize same-sex marriage should be \u201cowned by the parliament, and not by any particular party\u201d. Shorten subsequently suggested that a Liberal could co-sponsor the bill, rather than his deputy Tanya Plibersek. Liberal MP Warren Entsch has indicated his willingness to be involved in future negotiations, but not to co-sign Shorten\u2019s current bill. Irish Taoiseach (Prime Minister) Enda Kenny argued that his country\u2019s equality vote: \u201c\u2026 disclosed who we are \u2013 a generous, compassionate, bold and joyful people.\u201d Kenny\u2019s words raise questions about what message Australia\u2019s intransigence on same-sex marriage up to now is sending internationally \u2013 as well as to its own gay and lesbian citizens.

            "article_content": "CNN Opinion asked a range of contributors to give their take on Britain\u2019s election, what it means and what we can expect moving forward. The opinions expressed in these commentaries are solely their own. First surprise of Britain\u2019s election on Thursday \u2013 everyone was WRONG. So it\u2019s time to really dissect opinion polls \u2013 any kind of polling, really, and the media herd mentality. Conservative Prime Minister David Cameron won, securing an overall majority. No one even came close to predicting that. So, was it the 40% undecided that caused the tsunami? Continuity wins \u2013 change loses. It was a victory for traditional party politics that has dominated the United Kingdom for centuries. All the talk of a whole new coalition holding balance came to nothing, and three party leaders have resigned. Labour\u2019s Ed Miliband, stepped down. So did the far right U.K. Independence Party\u2019s Nigel Farage, who didn\u2019t even win the seat he was contesting. And in a sad day for coalition politics, there was Liberal Democrat Nick Clegg who, while holding onto his own seat, saw his party practically wiped out, prompting his resignation after spending a decade on the frontlines of often brutal British politics. For one brief, shining moment it was noted that at midnight local time every new MP officially declared was a woman \u2013 that didn\u2019t last long. But it is indeed true that now one in three MPs are female. David Cameron has promised to continue to try to fully restore Britain\u2019s economy, but what about Britain\u2019s role in the world? Whether it was Miliband or Cameron in 10 Downing Street, the concern in the United States and amongst allies was that Britain would continue retreating from the world \u2013 the controversy over its shrinking defense budget is likely to continue and experts say Britain will have to have a serious discussion after this election if it wants to continue as a world power. Many have made a big deal of that other tsunami \u2013 the sweep by the Scottish National Party and its newfound test in Westminster. But what will it do with the punch it can pack? It looks like the notion that the United Kingdom might be broken up has been averted, but Cameron\u2019s win poses the question of whether Britain will remain in the EU? Cameron\u2019s win \u2013 and the In/Out referendum he has promised \u2013 certainly keeps this unsettling question alive. I have learned a lot about my country during this general election. For one, we don\u2019t tend to tell pollsters what we\u2019re really thinking about things: the polls predicted a very tight race but it appears to have broken in favor of the Conservative Party. For another, we\u2019re incredibly divided. And whereas we were traditionally divided by class, we\u2019re now more divided by region. The right-wing Conservatives have spent the last five years leading a coalition with the Liberal Democrats, a slightly more centrist party. In that time they\u2019ve exacted significant cuts to spending and reformed welfare programs. The left-wing Labour Party warned that it would result in a recession \u2013 but it didn\u2019t. On the contrary, Britain now has the highest rate of employment since records began. But people aren\u2019t feeling the boom and Labour sensed that it could win by swinging to the left and offering more spending. So the scene was set for a classic Left vs. Right, class warfare campaign. But something changed all of that. Last year, the Scots held a referendum on whether or not to leave the United Kingdom and go it alone. They voted no \u2013 yet, curiously, the Scottish Nationalist Party actually saw its support rise in the wake of that verdict rather than fall. The SNP told the Scottish people that they could have something better than independence: they could stay in the Union but send Nationalist MPs to London to vote in their regional interest. The idea caught fire and it drained Labour\u2019s support in its traditional Scottish, working-class heartlands. Meanwhile, it probably increased support for the Conservatives in England because English voters were warned of the possibility of a Labour/SNP coalition that would tax them more to pay for Scottish services. The whole situation sounds very complicated, but it can be reduced to this: an election that should\u2019ve been about the economy became an election about the constitution. That the early polls and punditry didn\u2019t necessarily reflect this I put down to the number of voters who left it until the last minute to decide what to do. I traveled around the Midlands region of England, visiting swing voters in the suburbs and found that people were genuinely unsure of how they might vote. Or else unwilling to say. The leaderships of both Conservatives and Labour are very unpopular and don\u2019t generate passion. They look alike, sound alike and come from similar social backgrounds. There\u2019s a feeling that they represent an old-fashioned kind of politics that\u2019s out of touch with people\u2019s lives. By contrast, the real energy in this campaign was generated by a new generation of women campaigners. One was Nicola Sturgeon, leader of the SNP. She\u2019s a militant socialist and a passionate nationalist and, frankly, the forces that she represents frighten me. But she is undoubtedly charismatic and stole the show. As for the future, I suspect that Britain is starting to splinter off into two nations \u2013 or even several contrasting political identities. The break-up is sad, but even more tragic is the anger and bitterness involved. Old hatreds are being revived even as most British yearn for leadership that can heal their country. Timothy Stanley is a historian and columnist for Britain\u2019s Daily Telegraph. As the White House has been at pains to emphasize, the U.S. government does not take sides in foreign elections. But that doesn\u2019t mean that it doesn\u2019t care. Under Prime Minister David Cameron, Britain has been consciously reducing its influence in global affairs \u2013 slashing defense spending, cutting back on its diplomatic corps and basically standing aside as the United States launched an air war against the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria. For his second act, Cameron has promised a referendum on Britain\u2019s membership in the European Union that will preoccupy political Britain for the next two years and risk seriously weakening the EU. How is the White House likely to respond to all this? Well, we can expect U.S. officials to declare that they can work with whoever wins, although the exit polls and early results suggest that Cameron\u2019s Conservative Party is going to be returned to power. And the two countries will certainly continue to work effectively on many important issues.  Indeed, the truth is that a Labour government undoubtedly would have presented its own difficulties for the United States. But U.S. officials also understand that a second Cameron government means a continued loss of U.K. influence in the world and an even rockier ride for the already shaky European Union. This suggests that, regardless of the happy faces, the continued loss of strength in the U.K. and EU implied by the conservative victory will be viewed as far from good news for the United States.

(My British accent attracts these kinds of questions). First off, I was completely gobsmacked (stunned) that she said U.K. and not England. Brilliant! Alas, seconds later, my initial excitement was somewhat deflated when she followed that question up with another: \u201cAre they voting on the name of the new princess?\u201d Yes, there has been an election in Britain, a place I once called home. Yes, they actually have a real system of democracy over there. In fact, it\u2019s very similar to our system \u2013 it\u2019s mostly composed of people who lack even the merest shred of integrity and humanity \u2013 just like here. And no, the Queen does not cast the deciding vote. (It\u2019s Britain, not \u201cSurvivor\u201d). On Thursday, British people were able to vote online for the first time! Just think \u2013 they could see what their Facebook friends are eating and decide the future of their country at the same time! And just like in the U.S., temporary polling stations were set up in churches, schools, libraries. Britain is even more creative, though \u2013 they also make use of garages; hair salons; private residences; gyms; amateur boxing clubs; and of course pubs! That\u2019s right, you can have a drink and vote! Perfect. So, how has David done? Prime Minister David Cameron, that is, not Victoria Beckham\u2019s husband. David Cameron is the leader of the Conservatives, also known as the Tories. They are a bit like the Republicans, and they will be really happy with how this election has gone. One party that won\u2019t be happy about how Thursday\u2019s election went is Labour (yes, that\u2019s the proper spelling), the center-left party that supports trade unions, equality, the rights of the poor and organic gardens. Despite all this, though, they\u2019re often accused of taking bribes and expensive holidays on the taxpayers\u2019 dime. Sound familiar? Thought so. I\u2019d actually have been glad if one party had gotten a majority, because otherwise we have to put up with a \u201chung parliament,\u201d which sounds rather naughty \u2026 but it\u2019s just a mess. And however things end up, it was a win-win for those voters at the pub \u2013 they could either drown their sorrows or celebrate the results, if they stayed there until after the polls closed.

That\u2019s because the British people are a fair-minded, principled people \u2013 we don\u2019t just vote for who we think will benefit us personally, but the party who we believe to be most decent and which will benefit the country as a whole. We\u2019re a bit Angelina Jolie like that. But we\u2019re also disillusioned by politics. Many are disappointed with their day-to-day lives and by not being heard. As a result, this is not a two-horse race like the ones we see in America between Republicans and Democrats. Over here, people are voting for smaller parties, organizations that are getting noticed. And in this election \u2013 the most important in a very long time \u2013 that hasn\u2019t necessarily been a good thing. Why? Because just as right-wing parties have been making gains around the world \u2013 in France and Australia, for example \u2013 the racist right has been making inroads in Britain, too. And the U.K. Independence Party poses the most serious threat to civilized politics since the National Front launched back in 1967. As a result, this election has been more about keeping certain parties out, rather than voting out of enthusiasm for someone. This has been made even worse by the contamination of extremism in the British press \u2013 a dangerous deterioration over the years that has created a sense of disenchantment as misconceptions about issues of immigration and race have spread. Will the honorable voters keep turning out? It looks like they did for the \u201cslightly less bad\u201d party. And we can hold the right-wing bigots at bay a little longer.

The British election was fought with barely any discussion of foreign policy. Events in Ukraine or the possibility of a Greek default gained little notice. The only two campaign issues that related to the outside world \u2013 whether Britain continues with an independent nuclear deterrent and the possibility of a referendum on European membership \u2013 have been decided. The Trident program will now go ahead and be past recall in 2020 and there will be a referendum. The timing and management of this referendum will be crucial. Prime Minister David Cameron may be tempted to bring it forward while his authority in the party is greatest. This has been a more divisive issue in his ruling Conservative Party than in the country, and he will wish to get it settled once and for all. A referendum is always a gamble, but current projections suggest a comfortable yes vote, especially if backed by Cameron. Despite the nationalists\u2019 massive wins in Scotland there will not, incidentally, be another referendum on independence, although Edinburgh will get substantially more powers. The broad outlines of foreign policy will not change, but Cameron will be aware of concerns from the United States and elsewhere that the British voice has been quiet, even absent, when the crises of the day have been addressed and that insufficient is being spent on defense. Against expectations Britain now has a stable government that can look forward to five years in power. The question is whether, after the Scottish referendum and prolonged electoral uncertainty, this will enable the country to lift up its head and look harder at the outside world.

In what must surely rank as the oddest British election in memory, the Conservative Party has won a smashing victory. But so did its nemesis, the Scottish National Party, which ran the table north of Hadrian\u2019s Wall. The vote leaves three big questions hanging: Will Scotland leave Britain, will Britain leave Europe, and will the Labour Party learn how to win again? Although pre-election polls showed the Conservatives and Labour running neck and neck, the Tories look set to win an outright Parliamentary majority of 331. Labour, annihilated in Scotland, also failed to make inroads in England. Top Labour figures like Ed Balls and Douglas Alexander lost their seats and party leader Ed Miliband announced his resignation. Election night was even bleaker for the Liberal Democrats, the junior partner in the governing coalition. Getting a paltry 8% of the national vote, they went from having 57 MPs to just nine. That makes the upstart SNP Britain\u2019s third largest party. Even though the incumbent Tories won, the election confirmed a new configuration in British politics shaped by resurgent nationalism and the rise of new parties that are chipping away at the long-dominant Conservative-Labour duopoly. As analysts sift through the election results, some clear conclusions and lessons are emerging: First, fundamentals matter. Britain\u2019s economy is now the strongest in Europe. Unemployment is half the EU average, and London\u2019s financial and tech sectors are booming. In the closing days of the campaign, Prime Minister David Cameron warned repeatedly that Labour would reverse the policies \u2013 including fiscal discipline \u2013 he said have produced prosperity. Voters seem swayed by that argument, and the outcome will be seen as a vindication of \u201causterity.\u201d Second, holding the U.K. together will be the government\u2019s biggest challenge. The election confirmed that last year\u2019s referendum on independence did anything but slay the dragon of Scottish nationalism. The SNP is expected to win at least 56 of Scotland\u2019s 59 seats in Westminster. Its gains came mainly at Labour\u2019s expense, although the Lib Dems lost seats here too. So in the next Parliament the Tories will confront a large chunk of MPs dedicated to disunion with Britain. Third, the nativist U.K. Independence Party confirmed it\u2019s still a force in British politics, even as its flamboyant leader, Nigel Farage, lost his seat. UKIP garnered 13% of the national vote in England, but only won a single seat thanks to Britain\u2019s first-past-the-post electoral system. The anti-immigrant party wants Britain out of the EU, and since many Tories are also anti-Europe, Cameron will have to schedule the referendum on a \u201cBrexit\u201d he has promised. Meanwhile, the pro-Europe parties, Labour and the Lib Dems are diminished. In a further complication, the SNP wants Scotland to stay in Europe even as it splits with Britain. Fourth \u2013 and this lesson may apply as much to progressives in the United States as in Britain \u2013 Labour\u2019s campaign exposed the limits of class warfare and economic populism. Miliband focused his argument for change entirely on economic inequality. Claiming that Tory economic policies favor Britain\u2019s finance and business elites at the expense of the working class, he called for higher taxes on the rich and more rather than less public spending on social welfare. Missing from Miliband\u2019s highly redistributive message was an alternative theory for economic growth and competitiveness, or new ideas for modernizing public services. That made it easier for Cameron to cast Labour as a threat to Britain\u2019s hard-won fiscal and economic gains. In this sense, Miliband\u2019s campaign was a throwback to \u201cold Labour\u201d orthodoxy and an implicit repudiation of the New Labor\u2019s strategy crafted by Tony Blair and Gordon Brown, with an assist from Ed\u2019s older brother and former UK Foreign Secretary David Miliband. This strategy \u2013 consciously emulating Bill Clinton\u2019s \u201cNew Democrat\u201d success in America \u2013 enabled Labour to reach beyond its traditional working-class base and make deep inroads among the aspiring families of \u201cMiddle England.\u201d The result, beginning with Blair\u2019s landslide victory in 1997, was a new majority and Labour\u2019s longest stretch in government ever. While Miliband can\u2019t be held responsible for the debacle in Scotland, his narrative of economic grievance and unfairness failed to move voters in England, where Labour actually lost ground. Even adding the SNP\u2019s seats to Labour\u2019s total leaves the party far short of a majority. And the brutal rejection Labour suffered yesterday will likely leave many of its supporters wondering whether the party picked the right Miliband for leader. Will Marshall is president of the Progressive Policy Institute. What remains of the special relationship between London and Washington lies buried within the bowels of their respective intelligence and defense bureaucracies \u2013 and even there the relationship grows thinner with the decline in British military capabilities and America\u2019s efforts to pivot defense resources to Asia. The occupant of 10 Downing Street is no longer the first person a U.S. president thinks of calling when looking for support internationally. And British prime ministers since Tony Blair have gone out of their way not to be seen as the Oval Office\u2019s \u201cpoodle.\u201d This isn\u2019t likely to change following the British election, which took place Thursday. Of course, international events might change a future government\u2019s focus, as they sometimes do. But British foreign relations were an afterthought until the campaign\u2019s last days, with both Prime Minister David Cameron and main opposition Labour Party leader Ed Miliband paying principal attention to issues in governance and domestic affairs. The truth is that London\u2019s strategic vision has narrowed in recent years, more befitting its contemporary interests and capabilities and less the shadow of its empire past. This doesn\u2019t mean the U.K.-U.S. alliance is dead \u2013 too much history for that to happen \u2013 but neither is it likely to be what it once was anytime soon. Gary Schmitt is director of the Marilyn Ware Center for Security Studies at the American Enterprise Institute. Britain has voted in a general election that polls consistently suggested was one of the closest fought campaigns in years. This election might also prove to be one of the most crucial since the 1970s for determining the course of the country\u2019s foreign policy. Back in 1974, Labour leader Harold Wilson promised that, if elected to government, he would renegotiate Britain\u2019s membership of the European Union and hold a referendum. He won that election, renegotiated and his referendum passed, keeping the British-European marriage intact. But four decades later, the same promise is back on the political agenda \u2013 and this time, divorce seems a strong possibility. British Prime Minister David Cameron has vowed to hold an \u201cin/out\u201d vote on membership in late 2017 after he renegotiates London\u2019s relationship with Brussels. And while he is in favor of Britain staying in the EU, many on the right of his own party want to leave. The Eurosceptic U.K. Independence Party has benefited considerably from the growing anti-Brussels sentiment among the electorate, something that seemed set to further erode support for the Conservative Party. Main opposition Labour Party leader Ed Miliband had for his part said he would only hold a referendum if more powers were transferred from Westminster to the EU. (Both the Scottish Nationalist Party and the Liberal Democrats, meanwhile, are broadly pro-EU). But that won\u2019t matter now, and the Conservatives may not even have to look for coalition partners. As a result, many in Europe will be left wishing that somehow a Labour-led government had emerged triumphant in hopes of avoiding a renegotiation of key treaties. For them, the coming days may feel very long indeed. Michael J.

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Jay Parini, a poet and novelist, teaches at Middlebury College in Vermont.  His newest book is \u201cEmpire of Self:  A Life of Gore Vidal,\u201d which is forthcoming in October. Jay Parini: Bernie Sanders, who is running for President, is a liberal long shot, but he's also a populist truth-teller who speaks without fear He says the Vermont senator could help move Hillary Clinton to left on progressive issues Bernie Sanders, my Vermont senator and, indeed, a friend of many years, is now running for president.  He noted at his announcement (with a familiar note of wise irony):  \u201cPeople should not underestimate me.\u201d To most Americans, of course, Sen. Bernie Sanders is only a name, if that.  He is barely known to the general public, which makes him a very long shot indeed to win election to the highest office in the nation. Those who follow politics a little more closely will possibly think of him as some left-wing kook that only the most liberal state in the union would ever dream of electing to the Senate, as we did in 2006.  Let me add this, as someone who has followed him closely (and with admiration) for a long time:  When people stop to listen to Bernie, they realize that \u2013 whether or not they agree with his ideas \u2013 he is, without a question, an authentic voice who speaks without fear. And nobody should underestimate him. I remember when Bernie was mayor of Burlington; it is the largest city in Vermont (which isn\u2019t saying much).  I met him then, and his voice struck me as something not quite heard before.  He spoke with a throaty Brooklyn accent, and he was Jewish \u2013 not your typical Vermonter. He served as mayor of this progressive town on the shores of Lake Champlain with remarkable energy for many years, listening closely to what people had to say, learning about politics at the local level, making a real difference in the daily lives of hard-working people. He was never a Democrat \u2013 and isn\u2019t yet.  He\u2019s a progressive, holding his seat in the U.S. Senate as an independent, although he votes with the Democrats on major issues. When Bernie decided to run for Jim Jeffords\u2019 seat in the House of Representatives in 1988, many considered him a long shot.  I remember hosting a fundraising event at my farmhouse, where Bernie held the floor for almost two hours, answering questions with a forthrightness that stunned those who had never encountered in person his fierce, funny, entertaining, passionate voice.  Bernie won that seat, again and again. Make no mistake about this:  Vermont isn\u2019t just a rainbow-colored state full of ex-hippies and leftists in berets.  It\u2019s an agricultural economy, and Bernie has understood this well.  He has thoughtfully supported Vermont\u2019s dairy-farming community over many years.  He has also been a strong supporter of Vermont\u2019s hunting culture \u2013 much to the annoyance of many on the left, who wonder why the NRA doesn\u2019t attack him. I was never prouder of Bernie than during the run-up to the invasion of Iraq.  He was a singular and somewhat lonely voice in the House, strongly opposing the 2003 invasion.  He saw vividly that this was the worst foreign policy move in American history, one with endless repercussions. Sen. Sanders declares presidential candidacy He was especially outraged by the outing of former CIA spy Valerie Plame in 2006 by an official from the Pentagon, and he suggested in several fiery speeches that is was time for a serious investigation of how we got into the Iraq War in the first place. This was typical of Bernie: The clear voice in the midst of the crowd, the man who says no when somebody needs to say it loudly. So what would it look like if, by some bizarre chance, Bernie caught fire and became President? He would certainly work hard for universal health care, which has been a passion of his.  I\u2019ve heard him rail against the efforts of insurance and drug companies to undermine a system \u2013 the single-payer system \u2013 that has worked well throughout Europe for decades, reducing the costs of health care and actually improving it as well. He would not be Wall Street\u2019s best friend.  Indeed, he didn\u2019t support President George W. Bush in his efforts to bail out the bankers, and wrote an open letter to Henry Paulson, the U.S. Secretary of the Treasury, protesting that bailout.  Famously, on December 10, 2010, he gave an eight and a half hour speech on the floor of the U.S. Senate opposing the reinstatement of Bush-era tax cuts, a vivid piece of rhetoric worth looking at closely by anyone who wants to understand Bernie\u2019s views. He is a socialist, of course.  How many American politicians have ever said this aloud?   And what does he really mean by that term? Bernie knows what he\u2019s doing.  By proclaiming himself a socialist, he is drawing attention to the fact that large corporations and banks, many with international bases, have controlled American public policy for a very long time, usually to the detriment of working people. And it\u2019s working people who seem mostly to interest Bernie Sanders.  He has been one of only a few voices in the Senate in the past decade who has consistently pointed out that extreme right-wing factions funded by \u201cmillionaires and billionaires\u201d (one of Bernie\u2019s favorite mantras) have held sway over American politics for as long as anyone can recall. And this sway has usually operated to the detriment of people who actually repair roads, serve meals, deliver the mail, drive trucks and teach in schools. Sanders calls for political revolution As president, Bernie would also stand up against those who wish to deny climate change.   Indeed, Bernie co-sponsored with Barbara Boxer the Global Warming Pollution Reduction Act of 2007.   He has, for years, been a tireless advocate for the environment, aware of how its degradation has deeply hurt working people at home and abroad. But does he actually have the slightest chance of winning the Democratic nomination?  And if he won it, could he defeat a Republican candidate with billionaires at his or her disposal? He\u2019s not crazy.  In fact, he\u2019s probably the sanest person in the presidential sweepstakes.  But he can\u2019t win, and he knows that.  What he will do, however, is move Hillary Clinton on matters of importance to progressives: The restraining of Wall Street and large corporations, the scandal of how America allows its political campaigns to be funded  and the welfare of working class Americans, who seems pathetically easy to persuade \u2013 again and again \u2013 to vote against their own economic interests. A steep climb looms before him.  But I applaud Bernie Sanders.  I hope he soars and that his brave and commonsensical voice is heard. Follow us on Twitter @CNNOpinion.

The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. Harry Reid wants Chuck Schumer to succeed him as Senate minority leader Errol Louis: But some on left want to block Schumer's rise to leadership post Louis says Schumer is tuned into middle-class voters, could create new Democratic era Sen. Harry\u2019s Reid\u2019s perfunctory announcement on Friday that he won\u2019t seek re-election next year \u2013 leaving a vacancy for leadership of the Senate Democrats \u2013 was followed, hours later, by a matter-of-fact statement in an interview with The Washington Post: \u201cI think Schumer should be able to succeed me.\u201d That would usher in a whirlwind of activity on Capitol Hill in the next year as New York\u2019s senior senator prepares to seize the reins of power \u2013 and retool the party as a center-left powerhouse that can win and hold a majority in 2016 and beyond. Left-leaning activists have begun scrambling to block Chuck Schumer\u2019s rise. The progressive organization Democracy for America is calling for Sen. Elizabeth Warren to seek the leadership post, and the left-leaning Daily Kos website is circulating a poll seeking other challengers and denouncing Schumer as too close to the \u201cWall Street wing\u201d of the Democratic Party. With more than a year to go before Senate Democrats will choose a new leader, anything can happen. But after watching Schumer in action for more than 20 years, I\u2019d be surprised if he gets outsmarted in a political moment he has literally been working for a generation to create. With more than $13.4 million on hand in his campaign coffers, Schumer has more money than all but one member of the Senate \u2013 and is the only Democrat in the top 10 in that category.  He ran the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee when it took the majority in 2006 \u2013 and while Democrats lost the majority in 2014, the field looks far more promising for them in 2016: Republicans must defend 24 seats, while Democrats need to protect only 10. Schumer brings an extraordinary level of personal political skill to the leadership fight. Even among the 100-member Senate \u2013 home to a great many ambitious politicians with big egos \u2013 Schumer has long operated at a high-octane level of smarts and media-savvy brashness that impress and occasionally startle his colleagues. Republican Bob Dole, a longtime lion of the Senate, once quipped that the most dangerous place to be in the Capitol is between Schumer and a television camera. The joke stuck \u2013 but behind the gag is a sign of grudging respect for a man who excels at the basic block-and-tackle necessities of political life. Schumer is attuned to television and radio (growing up in the world\u2019s media capital will do that). In fact, he popularized a practice of holding press conferences on Sunday, a slow news day guaranteed to draw reporters \u2013 and ensure him prominent placement in the Monday newspapers. But he is also a consummate street politician: At 64, he maintains a habit of biking around New York City neighborhoods without fanfare or an entourage, quietly noting local problems and occasionally inviting himself into a block party or parade. When a reporter once casually asked him to name all 62 counties of New York state, Schumer did her one better, and hand-sketched a map of the state with all the counties filled in. (He visits every county in the state every year.) Schumer isn\u2019t the only politically ambitious kid from Brooklyn \u2013 before attending Harvard, he graduated from a public school, James Madison High, whose alumni include Supreme Court Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Sen. Bernie Sanders and ex-Sen. Norm Coleman of Minnesota (a childhood pal of Schumer\u2019s). Sen. Harry Reid on his Nevada upbringing But Schumer\u2019s political climb been a long-term work in progress. He emerged on the national stage as a prime sponsor of the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, a law that banned assault weapons; in the run-up to the final vote, New Yorkers practically couldn\u2019t turn on television without seeing Schumer, then a congressman, on the floor of the House, waving a rifle over his head as he argued for the ban. The higher profile served him well a few years later, when Schumer took on \u2013 and defeated \u2013 three-term incumbent Sen. Alfonse D\u2019Amato. As a senator on the rise, Schumer attracted politically ambitious staffers who moved on to high-profile positions where they can help their former mentor. A very partial list of those includes Howard Wolfson, Phil Singer and Blake Zeff, who went on to help run Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2008 campaign; Ben Lawsky, who is now shaking up the world of finance as New York\u2019s top banking regulator; Preet Bharara, who has become an anti-corruption powerhouse as a U.S. attorney; and Rodney Capel, who went on to become executive director of the state\u2019s Democratic Party and is currently a special advisor to Gov. Andrew Cuomo. With allies, money and the blessing of Reid, Schumer is in a prime position to implement the ideas contained in his important and overlooked 2007 book, \u201cPositively American,\u201d which lays out a vision for how Democrats should lead America. Like Schumer himself, the book is savvy, hopeful and politically attuned to the desires of middle-class voters. Those who wonder what a Schumer Senate leadership would look like should take a look as Democrats prepare for what could well be the start of the Schumer era on Capitol Hill. Correction: An earlier version of this commentary gave incorrect dates for when Charles Schumer chaired the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee and when the Democrats lost the Senate majority. It also incorrectly listed Rodney Capel's current position. Read CNNOpinion\u2019s new Flipboard magazine. Follow us on Twitter @CNNOpinion. Join us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion.",

Follow him on Twitter: @DavidALove The opinions expressed in this commentary are his. David Love: The former secretary of state would need to woo African-American voters to turn out in big numbers for 2016 Memories of the bitter 2008 battle with Barack Obama still linger, he writes Hillary Clinton held a closed door meeting with President Barack Obama at the White House on Monday.  Although the former secretary of state, senator and first lady has not declared, it is treated as a foregone conclusion that Clinton is running for president. Likely to launch her campaign in April, Clinton is regarded as the front-runner \u2014 if not the only Democratic candidate \u2014 and the inevitable Democratic nominee. There is an assumption that since Clinton supported Obama, the black community will now embrace her.  But there are more than a few who didn\u2019t get that memo.  At this stage of the game, many African-Americans may not be excited about a candidate Hillary Clinton in 2016. And after two terms of the nation\u2019s first black president, she should proceed with caution. Clinton need look no further than the 2008 contest, when black voters doused water on her presidential prospects.  Early on, Clinton was the favorite of black folks, lest you forgot, and it did not hurt that President Clinton had been regarded as the \u201cfirst black president\u201d with high approval among African-Americans. Then, support for a senator named Barack Obama blew up after the Iowa caucuses. And Clinton found herself apologizing for her husband\u2019s comments about Obama\u2019s win in the South Carolina primary. President Clinton was relieved of his black card privileges for the remainder of the 2008 election season when he compared Obama\u2019s win in the Palmetto state to that of Jesse Jackson in 2004 and 2008, suggesting that Obama, like Jackson, would not win.  The misstep was an affront to many African-Americans, as were Hillary Clinton\u2019s suggestions on the campaign trail that Obama was only good for making speeches, but not for taking action. And let\u2019s not forget her assertions that she was the candidate for \u201chard-working Americans, white Americans.\u201d We can chalk up some of that rhetoric to spirited campaign-trail junk-talking, and obviously much has happened since the 2008 election.  President Obama made Clinton his secretary of state, and she served as a capable top diplomat and a loyal member of the Obama Cabinet.  But that does not mean black voters will completely forget the bitter, racially tinged presidential campaign politics of seven years ago. Black voters are among the most loyal of the Democratic Party base, and their record high turnout for Obama  was an important part of his victory.  However, with a charismatic Obama no longer on the ballot, maintaining the same level of enthusiasm for any other candidate is a challenge. theGrio.com: Blacks are treated 72% as well as whites Moreover, as for Clinton, who (understandably?) has her own ideas and may not agree with the President on certain issues, any criticism of Obama could cost her some black voters.  Remember that Clinton voted in favor of the unpopular, costly and deadly Iraq war.  That support cost Clinton in 2008.  And while she has remained silent on the recent re-election of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Clinton\u2019s strongly pro-Israel stance on Mideast peace now appears at odds with the emerging consensus among major groups in the Democratic base, including blacks, Latinos and young voters. However, it is likely that foreign policy will not pose as great a challenge to Hillary Clinton as economics.  Because she is tied to the Wall Street wing of her party and commands sky-high speaking fees, people may take a closer look at her approach to tackling inequality and the shrinking of the middle class, and whether she is too concerned about offending the wealthy. The nation is hurting, despite the economic turnaround, and this is felt particularly strongly among blacks, who still have high unemployment rates, a rising wealth gap compared to whites, and, for many, no recovery in sight. And while police shootings of young black men continue to stir outrage in the community, Clinton has remained relatively quiet on the subject. She will have to prove that she can identify with this frustration and offer ideas for reform in local law enforcement. This, rather than her email account, is what concerns the black electorate. theGrio.com: Let\u2019s stop the \u2018struggle equation\u2019 Perhaps a populist, more down-to-earth challenger such as Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren or former Virginia Sen. Jim Webb could appeal to black and working-class voters, and unlike Clinton, would not have to fight the perception of living in a protective security bubble, or lacking core beliefs other than being in power. It is safe to assume that if Clinton wins the Democratic nomination that she will ultimately win the majority black vote in the general election, but that may not be enough. Let\u2019s remember President George W. Bush won re-election in 2004 with just 11% of the black vote. Had Mitt Romney been able to duplicate that number of black votes, he would be president now. Obama won in no small part because blacks turned out for him in record numbers in 2012, particularly in swing states like Ohio. Clinton can\u2019t assume she\u2019ll inherit that same level of black voter enthusiasm.  Support for Barack Obama does not necessarily translate into support for another Democrat.  This means Clinton must fight for votes like anyone else: knock on doors, kiss babies, clap off beat at the AME church, and do whatever it takes. Read CNNOpinion\u2019s new Flipboard magazine.

            "article_content": "The first trial of six police officers charged in Freddie Gray\u2019s death began last week, but the officers aren\u2019t the only ones standing in judgment. The city\u2019s black political leaders are facing their own day of reckoning as well. The death of Gray, a 25-year-old black man whose spine was virtually severed while in police custody, sparked one of the worst urban riots since the 1960s and led to the officers\u2019 arrests. His death also challenged a fundamental assumption that drove the civil rights movement and still reverberates in the demands of Black Lives Matter activists who press for black leadership in cities such as Ferguson. Their assumption: Black political power can right the wrongs white leaders failed to address. That belief propelled blacks into mayors\u2019 offices across the nation, beginning with the 1967 election of Carl Stokes in Cleveland. Those mayors vowed to create jobs and reduce police brutality. Some such as Maynard Jackson in Atlanta and Marion Barry in Washington became virtual folk heroes, lauded for breaking the power of white big-city bosses. And majority-black cities such as Baltimore \u2013 which has a black mayor, police chief, chief prosecutor and a majority-black City Council \u2013 became bastions of black political power. But if black political power is so important, why hasn\u2019t it made more of a difference in the lives of poor black people in Baltimore such as Gray? Freddie Gray to officer: 'I need help' That\u2019s because the city\u2019s black mayors have acted like political cowards, says William H. \u201cBilly\u201d Murphy Jr., the attorney for Gray\u2019s family. They\u2019ve been afraid to use the power of their office to insist the black community get a cut of the city\u2019s economic pie, says Murphy, whose father was one of the city\u2019s first black judges and whose family founded the city\u2019s black newspaper, the Baltimore Afro-American, more than a century ago. \u201cThere\u2019s been no black power in Baltimore even though there\u2019s the illusion of black power,\u201d says Murphy, who once ran unsuccessfully for mayor in Baltimore. \u201cIf mayors don\u2019t use their own power to help the black community, that\u2019s not power.\u201d Baltimore\u2019s current mayor, Stephanie Rawlings-Blake, was widely criticized in the city\u2019s black community for her handling of the protests and the subsequent riots in the wake of Gray\u2019s death. Rawlings-Blake, who is black, recently announced she will not to run for a second term and declined to be interviewed for this article. Kurt Schmoke, the city\u2019s first elected black mayor, did talk. Four of the city\u2019s past five mayors have been black. Nine of its 15 City Council members are black. The city\u2019s population is 63% black. Still, Schmoke says, black mayoral candidates in Baltimore and elsewhere can\u2019t run successful campaigns built on helping only black residents. \u201cIf you look at those who have been successful in elections, we ran on platforms that tried to include people, not divide people, and tried to expand economic opportunities for all,\u201d says Schmoke, who served three terms beginning in 1987. \u201cI don\u2019t think there was a need to make confrontational demands.\u201d The challenges black mayors face in Baltimore and elsewhere transcend race, Schmoke and others say. They don\u2019t fit the traditional explanations for the city\u2019s decline, such as mass incarceration or persistent poverty. And they are barely mentioned when commentators are asked why the city\u2019s poor black residents exploded in protests against a city and police force run primarily by blacks. Here are three theories to explain why black political power isn\u2019t enough to overcome such challenges in the city of Baltimore. Baltimore is a city of grim numbers: more than 300 homicides this year, the city\u2019s highest rate ever; about 16,000 vacant homes; and half of Maryland\u2019s welfare recipients. The numbers, though, don\u2019t do justice to what it\u2019s like to walk through the city\u2019s poorest black neighborhoods. People are living in squalor. There are crumbling sections of the black community that look like photographs of bombed-out German cities after World War II. There are hardly any decent sit-down restaurants in West Baltimore, where Gray was arrested. Young black men hang on dreary street corners day and night. Everything seems to be peeling away \u2013 the paint on the boarded-up row houses as well as the social fabric that once held the city together. He escaped 'the beast' of Baltimore Race has long been central to Baltimore\u2019s history. The city passed the nation\u2019s first racially restrictive housing laws in 1911. And for much of the 20th century, federal housing policy prevented blacks from buying homes in certain neighborhoods in Baltimore and elsewhere. That practice, known as \u201credlining,\u201d is one form of \u201cstructural racism\u201d \u2013 laws, practices and policies that appear race-neutral while reinforcing racial inequality. But there\u2019s another explanation for the struggles of Baltimore\u2019s black political leaders that proponents say has nothing to do with race. It\u2019s a critique that emerged in the conservative media after the riots. Baltimore\u2019s problem isn\u2019t an American problem; it\u2019s a liberal problem, says John Nolte, a commentator and editor-at-large at Breitbart News Network. Black leaders who cite the past to excuse the present are copping out, he says. \u201cIt boggles my mind that people are willing to blame Baltimore\u2019s current problems on government policies from 100 years ago, but not the failed left-wing policies that have been in effect for the last five decades,\u201d Nolte says. Among those policies, he says, are high taxes, overregulation, expensive social programs and the portrayal of police as murderers of black men instead of treating police brutality on a case-by-case basis. Baltimore hasn\u2019t had a Republican mayor since 1967; it\u2019s been run by Democratic mayors ever since. Nolte asks: Shouldn\u2019t they take the blame by now? \u201cThe failure of these policies in Baltimore has nothing to do with the color of the skin of those implementing them,\u201d Nolte says. \u201cDemocrats had free rein in Baltimore for going on 50 years. Nothing has stopped them from implementing their policies. The result is a total and complete failure.\u201d Murphy, the Gray family attorney, scoffs at the notion that Baltimore has been governed by liberal policies. \u201cThere aren\u2019t any liberal policies,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s liberal talk, but no liberal policies.\u201d If Baltimore\u2019s black mayors had governed like liberals, they would have followed the example of Jackson in Atlanta, he says. Murphy tells a story he likes to repeat in speeches. Some people say it\u2019s apocryphal, but the story hits on one of Murphy\u2019s favorite themes: black economic power. When Jackson was first elected in 1973, the city\u2019s white business leaders presented him with plans to expand Atlanta\u2019s airport, Murphy says. The leaders balked, though, when Jackson demanded the expansion include a certain percentage of black contractors. Jackson threatened to withhold the distribution of Atlanta\u2019s water to the airport if he didn\u2019t get his way, Murphy says \u2013 adding that the threat worked. Jackson practiced the art of political patronage to create black wealth, thus solidifying Atlanta\u2019s reputation as the Black Mecca. Faces of Baltimore Jackson only did what white mayors do when they control City Hall \u2013 use it to create economic opportunities for their constituents, Murphy says. Yet many contemporary black mayors are reluctant to do the same because they fear alienating white supporters who could potentially help them in bids for higher office. \u201cEverybody but black mayors understands that a deprived minority, like the Italian or Irish used to be, only advance if they use their political power to their economic advantage,\u201d Murphy says from the high-rise office of his firm, Murphy, Falcon & Murphy, near Baltimore\u2019s Inner Harbor. Schmoke, the former mayor, has heard those stories about crusaders like Jackson. But today\u2019s black mayors, he says, couldn\u2019t employ racial quotas and set-aside programs to lift up the black community even if they wanted to. \u201cIt\u2019s illegal,\u201d Schmoke says. \u201cSome of the set-aside programs that were active have been ruled unconstitutional by the Supreme Court.\u201d He cites the 1989 Richmond v. Croson case. After the city of Richmond, Virginia, decided to award a set percentage of city construction projects to black firms, the high court ruled the city\u2019s actions violated the Constitution\u2019s equal protection clause. The historical mistreatment of a disadvantaged group could not be used to justify \u201crigid\u201d quotas for awarding public contracts, the court said. Demographic trends also have hemmed in Baltimore\u2019s black mayors, Schmoke says. In 1950, Baltimore had a population around 950,000. Today, it\u2019s about 620,000. The exodus hammered the city\u2019s revenue. Fewer people means less money from property taxes and other fees. And less money means fewer resources for those left behind. The exodus, Schmoke says, was propelled by the construction of the Interstate Highway System in the 1950s, which accelerated suburbanization. It was also driven by race. Whites began leaving Baltimore and other American cities in droves after public schools were desegregated during the 1960s and urban riots that erupted in the late 1960s. \u201cIt\u2019s not just white flight; it was middle-class flight,\u201d Schmoke says. \u201cAll that tax base is gone.\u201d The city\u2019s population decline also led to a loss of mayoral clout, says Marion Orr, an urban studies professor at Brown University who once served as a consultant to Baltimore\u2019s school board. As its population fell, so did the city\u2019s representation at the state assembly. State delegates don\u2019t pay as much attention to Baltimore today because so many of their constituents live elsewhere. A black mayor can speak up for the city\u2019s black community, but no one may be listening, says Orr, author of \u201cBlack Social Capital: The Politics of School Reform in Baltimore.\u201d \u201cAs the power shifts from the city to the rural and suburban areas,\u201d he says, \u201cthe city\u2019s voice in state politics weakens.\u201d When he was mayor, Schmoke says, the chairman of the state House Appropriations Committee and the majority leader in the state Senate were both from Baltimore. \u201cThat was a huge benefit,\u201d Schmoke says. \u201cThey could get in the rooms with the governors and the other legislators and negotiate on our behalf. They could affect where the state\u2019s budget money went.\u201d Grim milestone: Baltimore records most homicides in 16 years With a loss of people, money and clout, some say, the city\u2019s political leadership was in a poor position to face the modern-day scourge that devastated Baltimore\u2019s poor black community: the violence induced by crack cocaine that swept the city in the 1980s. Rather than governing from the left as conservatives such as Nolte argue, Baltimore\u2019s Democratic leadership actually made things worse by taking a page from Republicans\u2019 playbook, says New Republic writer Rebecca Leber. \u201cDemocrats exacerbated these problems not by embracing the policies of the left. \u201cRather, they dug the hole deeper by yawing to the right,\u201d Leber wrote earlier this year in an article entitled, \u201cLiberal Policies Didn\u2019t Fail Baltimore. Here\u2019s What Did.\u201d \u201cAggressive policing, tougher drug sentencing, slashing the budgets of school and public housing and parks \u2013 throughout Baltimore\u2019s history, lawmakers at the local, state, and federal level adopted policies that entrenched poverty and segregation in the city.\u201d There\u2019s one part of Baltimore, though, that\u2019s doing just fine today. It\u2019s the city\u2019s tourist hot spot, the Inner Harbor. Once a bleak stretch of docks occupied by wharf rats and ringed by sleazy hotels, the Inner Harbor now offers grand sports stadiums, fashionable restaurants, luxury hotels and a national aquarium. The Inner Harbor is only about a 10-minute drive from Gray\u2019s Sandtown neighborhood. A person could stand on a hill near where Gray was arrested and not only peer down into the Inner Harbor but spot massive tankers in the distance heading out to sea on Chesapeake Bay. But the Inner Harbor might as well be Mars for many of the city\u2019s poorest black residents, says Orr, because they get little economic benefit from its existence. Most of the jobs generated by the Inner Harbor are \u201cpoverty-level jobs,\u201d the Brown professor says. \u201cThey\u2019re not really living-wage jobs,\u201d Orr says. \u201cThere\u2019s no longer a Bethlehem Steel here to provide good, living-wage jobs for young people who finish high school but don\u2019t go onto college. That\u2019s something that a mayor has very little control over.\u201d It\u2019s not just the loss of blue-collar jobs that hurts Baltimore\u2019s black community. It\u2019s the arrival of what Orr calls \u201cmobile capital\u201d \u2013 contemporary multinational corporations that bring jobs to cities such as Baltimore but make no pretense of loyalty to any city. 'Lord of the Flies' comes to Baltimore Baltimore residents know what it\u2019s like to be abandoned. Many still remember the sting of betrayal they felt when local television cameras caught the NFL\u2019s Baltimore Colts departing for Indianapolis in the middle of the night in Mayflower moving vans despite the Colts\u2019 owners\u2019 vows to never move the beloved team. Big businesses come and go as they please now in cities such as Baltimore. A black mayor can promise to bring jobs to the black community, Orr says, but he or she really has little sway over these huge companies. \u201cIf you\u2019re running for the mayor of a city, you can\u2019t say that,\u201d Orr says. \u201cYou\u2019re going to have to say, \u2018I can bring jobs.\u2019 You want people to come out and vote for you.\u201d Schmoke recalls how helpless he felt when confronted with the mobility of modern business. When he became mayor in 1987, nine large banks were headquartered in Baltimore. By the time he left office in 1999, all had either become branches of another major bank or relocated to other U.S. cities or overseas. \u201cYou can\u2019t stop that,\u201d Schmoke says. \u201cThere are some things you can control. You can provide tax incentives. But if a corporation is talking about moving out of the country for federal tax purposes, a local mayor can\u2019t stop that.\u201d The mayor of Baltimore also has little control when it comes to expanding the city\u2019s boundaries to stem white and middle class flight, Schmoke says. Some American cities coped with the exodus of city dwellers by annexing surrounding counties. They kept their tax bases healthy simply by adding more taxpayers. The mayor of Baltimore can\u2019t do the same, Schmoke says. There\u2019s a provision in the state constitution that says a city can only annex a county if it receives approval from city and county voters. The possibility of suburban residents agreeing to become part of Baltimore today is remote, Schmoke says. \u201cYou can imagine the county\u2019s residents don\u2019t want to be annexed into the city,\u201d Schmoke says. \u201cIf the city could have just reached out and expanded its boundaries by attaching itself to those who have moved out, we would have a larger tax base and we would have been able to address a lot of these social issues.\u201d If the city can\u2019t expand, it has to get better. And now several mayoral candidates are saying they\u2019re going to make that happen. So far, at least 18 people have announced they\u2019re running in the November 2016 election. The early front-runner is the city\u2019s third black mayor, Sheila Dixon, who resigned in 2010 after she was convicted of stealing gift cards meant for the city\u2019s poor residents. One intriguing candidate is Nick Mosby. He is the council member from the West Baltimore community where riots erupted this year \u2013 and the husband of Baltimore State\u2019s Attorney Marilyn Mosby, who is leading the prosecution of the six officers charged in Gray\u2019s death. Mosby says he has first-hand experience with the world Gray navigated. He grew up in inner-city East Baltimore, was raised by a single mother and was the first one in his family to graduate from college. He says the city\u2019s mayor still holds plenty of power. Baltimore has a $3.2 billion annual budget, and a mayor can decide what issues he or she is going to tackle the hardest, he says. A mayor can change the socio-economic trajectory of poor black neighborhoods by making them a priority, he says. \u201cUrban decay is as American as apple pie,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s not a Baltimore problem. It\u2019s an American problem.\u201d Mosby may be right. What\u2019s happening in Baltimore is now spreading to white working-class communities nationwide, according to a recent study. An epidemic of drug abuse and despair has hit white middle-age Americans who have less education, according to a new study co-authored by Nobel Prize-winning economist Angus Deaton. Some say more working-class whites are dying younger because they are pessimistic about their economic future. For now, Baltimore is focusing on the present. The six police officers face charges ranging from official misconduct to second-degree murder with a depraved heart. Three of the officers are black, three white. All have pleaded not guilty. Their trials, which are being held separately and consecutively, could extend into next April \u2013 the one-year anniversary of Gray\u2019s death. There are questions, though, that lurk in the background of Gray\u2019s case: Will a new mayor mark a new direction for Baltimore? Can the city stop being a symbol of black urban dysfunction? Or will the city\u2019s black neighborhoods continue their long slide into decay, no matter how many black mayors are elected? Those are questions no trial can answer.",

            "article_content": "Pope Francis is visiting Cuba until Tuesday when he heads to the United States. CNN will have full coverage online and on CNN TV. Political slurs and conspiracy theories used against Barack Obama are now aimed at the Pope Among the accusations: He's a socialist, the Antichrist or an illegitimately elected leader They're \"the worst possible thing the right-wing Id can come up with,\" says one observer Some pontiffs have been beatified or canonized, but Pope Francis is receiving a far more dubious honor. He\u2019s being \u201cObamified.\u201d The charismatic Pope, who arrives in the United States on September 22, has gained fans in and out of the Catholic Church for denouncing unfettered capitalism, warning about climate change and urging mercy toward divorced couples and women who have had abortions. He\u2019s also sparked a strange trend. The same political slurs and conspiracy theories that critics have used against President Barack Obama are now being deployed against Pope Francis. One critic even says the two leaders have morphed into one sinister figure he calls \u201cPopama.\u201d The Obamification of Pope Francis includes charges from conservative critics that he\u2019s either a socialist, the Antichrist, an illegitimately elected leader who wants to create a \u201cNew World Order\u201d \u2013 or all of the above. Their anxiety was captured by the headline of one online column: \u201cPope Francis is the Catholic Church\u2019s Obama \u2013 God help us.\u201d Such apocalyptic warnings about Francis reflect normal anxiety over a new leader, says Greg Erlandson, publisher of Our Sunday Visitor, a Catholic organization that distributes church textbooks and religious materials. \u201cThere\u2019s been some crazy stuff going around,\u201d Erlandson says. \u201cYou\u2019re always going to get a fringe element, on both the left and right. There\u2019s some guy in Canada claiming to be the Pope.\u201d Yet conservative concerns over Pope Francis appear to be growing. A Gallup poll this summer showed that Pope Francis\u2019 support among American conservatives fell from 72% last year to 45% in July. \u201cThere is a sense that he is or could be introducing significant changes in the church,\u201d Erlandson said, \u201cand people find that very threatening.\u201d Some of that anxiety goes beyond traditional debate over church doctrine. Here are three ways the Pope is being Obamified: Religion and money \u2013 it\u2019s hard to find a more combustible combination. Pope Francis\u2019 comments on faith and finance have ignited a theological firestorm. He said the poor have \u201csacred rights\u201d of labor, lodging and land. He called the \u201cunfettered pursuit of money\u201d the \u201cdung of the devil\u201d and accused world leaders of \u201ccowardice\u201d for refusing to defend the Earth from exploitation. During a speech to grassroots organizers in Bolivia in July, he called on the poor to rise up against \u201cnew colonialism,\u201d including corporations, loan agencies, free trade treaties and austerity measures. The Pope\u2019s critique of capitalism has caused some \u2013 including conservative radio talk host Rush Limbaugh \u2013 to suggest Francis is a Marxist, a label he denied in a 2013 interview with an Italian newspaper. \u201cThe Marxist ideology is wrong,\u201d Francis said. \u201cBut I have met many Marxists in my life who are good people, so I don\u2019t feel offended.\u201d Yet some conservative critics don\u2019t believe the Pope. Like Obama, they accuse him of being a secret socialist. Conservative radio show host Michael Savage said the Pope is a \u201cstealth Marxist in religious garb.\u201d Fox News business show host Stuart Varney warned in June that the Pope may align with Obama to gang up on the rich. \u201cWill Francis and Barack reshape the world by taxing the rich, taxing fossil fuels and redistributing the wealth?\u201d Varney asked. \u201cThat\u2019s exactly what they are trying to do.\u201d The Pope should be trusted when talking about matters of faith, some critics say, but he\u2019s outside of his depth when talking about economics. Denise C. McAllister, a senior contributor to the Federalist, a conservative online magazine that covers politics, religion and culture, said the Pope\u2019s \u201csocial justice schemes\u201d are immoral and similar to Obama\u2019s \u201csocialist ideology.\u201d McAllister wrote that Catholics have a moral responsibility to care for the poor, \u201cbut the greatest vehicle for alleviating poverty and deprivation is the very institution of free market capitalism that [the Pope] now denounces.\u201d \u201cHe says people have a right to land, lodging and labor,\u201d McAllister told CNN. \u201cWhen you\u2019re talking about giving to one, you\u2019re talking about taking from another. It\u2019s wrong and immoral for a powerful government to take property from you and give it to another group.\u201d Yet Patrick J. Deneen, a Notre Dame professor, says Francis\u2019 statements on capitalism are no different from those of his predecessors. The Catholic Church has long been critical of unfettered capitalism. He says Pope Benedict XVI once wrote about the importance of \u201cdistributive justice and social justice for the market economy.\u201d \u201cEven though the church\u2019s teachings have not changed one jot under Francis, he has placed more emphasis on economic matters,\u201d says Deneen. In July, Jennifer LeClaire asked readers of Charisma magazine to Google the phrase \u201cIs Pope Francis Antichrist.\u201d The query produced 425,000 hits, she noted.  (That number is now 440,000.) Pope Francis hasn\u2019t yet caught up with Obama in the Antichrist category. A Google search for \u201cIs Obama the Antichrist\u201d yields more than 800,000 results. But LeClaire\u2019s column reported on a growing belief among some Catholics that the Pope is a diabolical figure in papal clothing. \u201cCould Francis be the final Pope before Christ\u2019s return?\u201d LeClaire asked. \u201cCould he be the Antichrist? Is he the False Prophet? The chatter continues. \u2026 \u201c A recent Washington Post article noted there has \u201csprung up a cottage industry of books, DVDs and websites promoting Francis\u2019 dissenters.\u201d Pope Francis is not a legitimately elected holy vicar of Jesus Christ as many believe, but he is the very igniter of a new world. Paul Joseph C., editor of The Wild Voice Some of the dissent leads to conspiracy theories that would be familiar to anyone who has followed conservative reaction to Obama\u2019s presidency. After his election in 2008, rumors circulated that Obama\u2019s victory was not legitimate because he was not actually born in the United States and there was massive voter fraud. Similar conspiracy theories about Pope Francis\u2019 election \u201cwon\u2019t die,\u201d according to David Gibson, a reporter for the Religion News Service. The theories revolve around the belief that Francis doesn\u2019t have a legitimate claim to the papacy. \u201cAmong them,\u201d Gibson wrote, \u201cBenedict used incorrect Latin in his formal resignation letter, so it is invalid; alternately, they say, the cardinals in the March 2013 conclave that elected Francis violated certain procedures, so his election is null and void.\u201d One critic who goes by the name Paul Joseph C. edits The Wild Voice, a website devoted to Catholic current events and subjects such as \u201cthe mark of the beast\u201d and the \u201cIlluminati.\u201d He says Obama and Francis are both cunning figures \u2013 but that the Pope is even more dangerous. \u201cWe are in the presence of a very powerful political figure, the likes of which we have never witnessed before,\u201d he says. \u201cPope Francis is not a legitimately elected holy vicar of Jesus Christ as many believe, but he is the very igniter of a new world.\u201d He writes that Francis and Obama are \u201cperfect dictators\u201d who are using their anti-Christian agenda to ruin America and the church. He sees such disturbing similarities between the Pope and the President that he calls Francis \u201cPopama.\u201d The conspiracy theories have strayed into the mainstream media. After the Pope recently spoke about the dangers of climate change, Fox News commentator Lou Dobbs warned that Francis was describing \u201ca new world order\u201d and \u201ca new global organization.\u201d Where does this talk come from? Elizabeth Stoker Bruenig, a religious commentator who has written about Pope Francis for the New Republic, says critics use such language because the Pope and Obama have in one way uttered blasphemy \u2013 they question the sanctity and the \u201cmoral neutrality of markets.\u201d \u201cWhat all these things have in common is that they\u2019re essentially the worst possible thing the right-wing Id can come up with,\u201d she says. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to actually do anything indicative of being a socialist, communist or the Antichrist to earn these titles.\u201d After Obama was elected, critics said he apologized too much for the sins of America\u2019s past. Conservatives labeled one of the President\u2019s earliest international travel stints as \u201cBarack Obama\u2019s Apology Tour.\u201d Some are now making the same accusation against Pope Francis. During his speech in Bolivia, Francis apologized for the Catholic Church\u2019s treatment of Native Americans. \u201cI humbly ask forgiveness, not only for the offense of the church herself,\u201d Francis said, \u201cbut also for crimes committed against the native peoples during the so-called conquest of America.\u201d And during a visit to an Italian church last month, the Pope apologized for past persecution of Pentecostals under Italy\u2019s early 20th century fascist government. The apologies irritated one critic so much that Adam Shaw, an editor for FoxNews.com, wrote the opinion piece entitled, \u201cPope Francis is the Catholic Church\u2019s Obama \u2013 God Help Us.\u201d \u201cJust like President Obama loved apologizing for America, Pope Francis likes to apologize for the Catholic Church, thinking that the church is at its best when it is passive and not offending anyone\u2019s sensibilities,\u201d Shaw wrote. Carl Olson, editor of Catholic World Report, said he and other Catholics think Pope Francis expends too much energy apologizing for and chiding the faithful. In a column last month entitled, \u201cThe hyperbolic and exhausting papacy of Francis,\u201d Olson wrote that the Pope obsesses over certain points such as the sin of gossip to a degree \u201cthat is frankly grating.\u201d Olson, who describes himself as an orthodox Catholic, says the Pope seems to ignore the struggles of ordinary middle class people who work, raise families, pay the taxes and \u201ckeep society afloat while chaos and madness swirls around.\u201d \u201cAt times it appears that the Pope will praise non-Catholics, including atheists, but then ignore how hard ordinary Catholics are striving to live the faith,\u201d Olson says. Some have even suggested that Pope Francis\u2019 allegiance to the Catholic Church is so shaky that he has an Islamic agenda \u2013 an accusation similar to one directed at Obama. In her Charisma article about the Pope, LeClaire dismissed rumors that Francis said the Bible and the Quran are the same. Could Francis be the final Pope before Christ\u2019s return? Could he be the Antichrist? Is he the False Prophet? Jenifer LeClaire, Charisma magazine senior editor Then she added: \u201cMeanwhile, Francis has warmed up to Islam like no other Pope before him. In a historic first, Francis opened the door to Muslim prayers and Quran readings at the Vatican last year. Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and Israeli President Shimon Peres joined the pontiff in the Vatican gardens for a prayer meeting.\u201d Still, the Pope and the President are different in at least one crucial way, says Earle Scarlett, a retired U.S. diplomat who writes about religion. While arguing that Obama and Francis share a yearning for economic justice, Scarlett says Francis is freer than Obama to pursue his vision because the same checks and balances that stymie the power of the presidency don\u2019t exist in the Vatican. \u201cIn the American government, a guy can get up and say you\u2019re a liar to the president,\u201d Scarlett says. \u201cCan you imagine a bishop or cardinal saying that to the Pope in a meeting? I never heard of a Pope being dethroned. But I\u2019ve heard of presidents being impeached.\u201d As the Pope visits the United States, it\u2019s doubtful anyone will stand up and call him a socialist or the Antichrist. But among Pope dissenters, the chatter will continue.",

            "article_content": "As the \u201960s turned to the \u201870s, America had already been at war in Vietnam for almost eight years. By then, the majority of Americans wanted out, Richard Nixon was trying not to become first U.S. president to lose a war while the troops just wanted to come home alive. CNN\u2019s original series \u201cThe Seventies\u201d looks back on this chapter in American history in the episode, \u201cPeace With Honor.\u201d But how did the media see these events as they were happening?  We looked through Time magazine\u2019s vault to discover how \u201chistory\u2019s first draft\u201d read in the pages of that storied publication. The opposition to the Vietnam War grew steadily through the \u201960s, but Nixon was able to rally support for the war from the \u201cGreat Silent Majority\u201d of the middle class. On May 4, 1970, however, support for the war took a decisive turn when four Kent State students were killed by Ohio National Guardsman. Crosby, Stills & Nash on 'Ohio' Time\u2019s article \u201cNation: At War with War\u201d from May 18, 1970, noted the temperature of the nation right after Kent State: With an almost manic abruptness, the nation seemed, as Yeats once wrote, \u201call changed, changed utterly.\u201d With the killing of four Kent State University students by Ohio National Guardsmen last week, dissent against the U.S. venture into Cambodia suddenly coalesced into a nationwide student strike. Across the country 441 colleges and universities were affected, many of them shut down entirely. Antiwar fever, which President Richard Nixon had skillfully reduced to a tolerable level last fall, surged upward again to a point unequaled since Lyndon Johnson was driven from the White House. The military advantage to be gained in Cambodia seemed more and more dubious, and Nixon found that he had probably sacrificed what he himself once claimed was crucial to achieving an acceptable settlement: wide domestic support, or at least acquiescence, for his policies. Now it is the opposition that has gained strength. The Kent State killings lead to greater opposition to the war among the American public, but it was the release of the Pentagon Papers that helped fuel the speculation that U.S. government was misleading the public about Vietnam. Daniel Ellsberg, a U.S. military analyst, turned against the war and released thousands of top-secret Pentagon files about the war. The papers revealed that top U.S. officials were told in advance how long, costly and improbable a victory would be in Vietnam. The New York Times began publishing the Pentagon Papers on June 13, 1971, leaving the Nixon administration scrabbling to block the paper\u2019s publication. As Time\u2019s article \u201cThe Nation: Pentagon Papers: The Secret War\u201d from June 28, 1971, notices, that ended up putting a bigger spotlight on the papers: The dramatic collision between the Nixon Administration and first the New York Times, then the Washington Post, raised in a new and spectacular form the unresolved constitutional questions about the Government\u2019s right to keep its planning papers secret and the conflicting right of a free press to inform the public how its Government has functioned. Yet, even more fundamental, the legal battle focused national attention on the records that the Government was fighting so fiercely to protect. Those records afforded a rare insight into how high officials make decisions affecting the lives of millions as well as the fate of nations \u2026 With the war continuing to lose support of Americans and Nixon up for re-election in November, both North Vietnam and America stepped up negotiations in an effort to reach peace.  Nixon\u2019s administration thought a peace deal would ensure his re-election where the North Vietnamese (and many anti-war Americans) were unsure what actions a newly re-elected Nixon would take. Time\u2019s article \u201cTHE WAR: At Last, The Shape of a Settlement\u201d from October 30, 1972, reads: Clearly, the U.S. election has played a powerful role \u2013 on both sides. \u2026 If Nixon were to win a second term, Kissinger argued, the Administration offer could well harden. In September, by the reckoning of intelligence analysts in Washington, the polls began to convince the Hanoi Politburo that a victory by McGovern, who has proposed that the U.S. should \u201cbreak free of Thieu\u201d with a unilateral withdrawal, was a poor gamble. Just days before the election, Henry Kissinger announced that \u201cPeace is at hand,\u201d but it was South Vietnam President Nguyen Van Thieu who rejected the deal. Thieu felt the U.S. would be leaving South Vietnam to fend off North Vietnam by itself.  On Election Day, the fears of the North Vietnamese and U.S. liberals came true. Nixon won in a landslide. Time\u2019s article \u201cTHE PRESIDENCY: What Will He Do the Next Four Years?\u201d from November 20, 1972, reads: Vietnam POWs return home The fact that Richard Nixon need no longer worry about appealing to masses of voters was either scary or hopeful, depending upon the angle of view. Radicals and some liberals professed to have nightmares of an \u201cunleashed\u201d Nixon, finally free to throw dissenters into jails and to nuke Hanoi if it did not knuckle under. Time\u2019s words proved to be an eerie premonition, less than a month after it was published, Nixon launched the largest bombing campaign of the war. After peace talks failed once again, on December 18, 1972, American bombers began dropping over 20,000 tons of bombs on North Vietnam until they agreed to return to the negotiation table. The two-week assault known as \u201cThe Christmas Bombing\u201d was a prime example of the extreme shifts between war and peace that had come to characterize the Vietnam War. TIME\u2019s article \u201cTHE WAR: Nixon\u2019s Blitz Leads Back to the Table\u201d on January 8, 1973, reads: In its swift swings between lull and violence, hope and despair, the Viet Nam War has often had a manic character to it. Never more so than in the latest extraordinary episode in which, within the space of 40 days, the world moved from a sense of peace at last at hand, to the most brutal U.S. bombing of the war, to Washington\u2019s declaration late last week that the secret Paris peace talks would begin again on Jan. 8. \u2026 Rarely if ever before had a major power so openly used overwhelming force to extract concessions at the conference table, or moved so swiftly from diplomacy to war and back; the episode almost evoked the end of the Thirty Years\u2019 War, when fighting and negotiating accompanied each other in a dizzying blur. The news of the bombing halt was as puzzling as it was welcome. While the actual end of the Vietnam War didn\u2019t come until April 1975 when the North Vietnamese took control of Saigon, a cease-fire was agreed upon on January 23, 1973, which marked the end of American military involvement in the war. Unlike wars in the past, there was no ticker tape parade celebrating the end of the war. American prisoners of war were celebrated on their arrival home but as the Time essay \u201cPostwar US.: The Scapegoat is Gone\u201d from February 5, 1973, points out, they were coming home to a country full of our own problems. Unfortunately, these are problems that we are still facing today: Troops fight to survive the end of the Vietnam war After ten years, the Viet Nam War has become more than a national curse. It was also a national excuse. The proliferation of drug abuse, crime in the streets, lack of respect for authority, racism \u2013 all these were conveniently stenciled \u201cmade in Viet Nam.\u201d The war\u2019s impact, goes the conventional wisdom, went against the American grain and splintered the country into discrete and angry factions. \u2026 But the war is over now, and soon the scapegoat will be led away. Then it will no longer be possible to see all domestic evils as the orphans of war. As partisan historians have taken pains to show, violence is in, not against, the American grain.",

            "article_content": "Hillary Clinton's performance at the Democratic debate Saturday night was aimed at the general election more so than the primary She gave her rivals -- including Vermont independent Sen. Bernie Sanders -- a pass over a dispute considering improperly obtained voter data Hillary Clinton believes, finally, that the force is with her. The former secretary of state\u2019s tactics and performance in Saturday\u2019s Democratic debate suggested that she thinks that though her campaign struggled out of the gate following a series of personal missteps, the nomination may be finally within her grasp as voting in first-in-the-nation states looms. Sometimes, the fights politicians chose to skip reveal as much about them as the ones they decide to wage. And Clinton sent a clear signal in New Hampshire about where her real targets lie in the 2016 presidential race. She gave her rival, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, a pass on a voting data controversy that sparked bitter disputes between their campaigns over the previous 24 hours. Instead, she opted to lacerate Donald Trump and sought to tar the Republican Party brand with his antics. Clinton has no desire to fuel an internal Democratic brushfire that could offer supporters of Sanders, already skeptical of her positions on issues from war to Wall Street, new reasons to fulminate against her campaign. RELATED: Democratic debate: Clinton, Sanders spar over ISIS, taxes and Wall Street And less than seven weeks before the Iowa caucuses herald the start of voting in the Democratic nomination contest, Clinton has succeeded in blunting the Sanders surge that threatened her White House hopes during the summer \u2013 allowing her to focus on arguments she would make in a general election campaign. \u201cShe has nothing to gain from an ongoing dispute with Bernie Sanders; she has got bigger things in mind,\u201d said CNN senior political analyst David Axelrod. Indeed, Clinton made clear that \u2013 on the debate stage at least \u2013 she wanted to focus elsewhere. \u201cI don\u2019t think the American people are all that interested in this,\u201d said Clinton on the data flap, returning a favor to Sanders after he used an earlier debate to grant her cover on the scandal over her use of a private email server while secretary of state then threatening to consume her campaign. Sanders opened the debate by apologizing to Clinton after it emerged that a now fired staffer on his campaign had accessed data about her voting lists during a security glitch affecting a firewall on a third-party server hosting Democratic voting statistics. \u201cNot only do I apologize to Secretary Clinton \u2026 I want to apologize to my supporters. This is not the type of campaign that we run,\u201d Sanders said. The tone of comity was a departure from the spiky ideological clashes that rumbled through the latest GOP debate on Tuesday. In that and previous GOP debates, a vast field of candidates have struggled to fit on a single camera shot, throwing punches in multiple directions. The three Democratic candidates, in contrast, looked dwarfed by a huge stage at St. Anselm College in Manchester, New Hampshire \u2013 and despite differences between candidates, particularly on national security, Republicans would argue that the more intense atmosphere of their debates is a sign of a much more engaged political base than is the case for Democrats. Either way, the absence of telling blows from Clinton\u2019s opponents allowed the former secretary of state to lash out at Republicans, furthering an impression that she is already more concerned about a general election fight than the party nominating race. She particularly took aim at Donald Trump, whom Democrats hope to paint not as an outlier from Republican Party orthodoxy but as a representative of a party that could alienate more moderate Americans. \u201cI worry greatly that the rhetoric coming from the Republicans, particularly Donald Trump, is sending a message to Muslims here in the United States and literally around the world that there is a \u2018clash of civilizations,\u2019\u201d Clinton said, one of many points where she sought to draw the real estate mogul into the Democrats\u2019 debate. She added that GOP positions, which have included a call by Trump to bar Muslim immigrants from entering the United States in the wake of terror attacks in Paris and California, were fanning \u201cthe flames of radicalization.\u201d \u201cWe also need to make sure that the really discriminatory messages that Trump is sending around the world don\u2019t fall on receptive ears,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cHe is becoming ISIS\u2019s best recruiter. They are going to people showing videos of Donald Trump insulting Islam and Muslims in order to recruit more radical jihadists,\u201d she continued, though her contention is disputed. RELATED: Democratic debate: CNN\u2019s Reality Check team inspects the claims She also took stances on national security at odds with her Democratic competitors. While her rivals Sanders and former Maryland Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley were keen to portray themselves as much closer to the dovish Democratic base on U.S. intervention abroad, she felt comfortable laying out a robust program to tackle ISIS \u2013 including a no-fly zone in Syria \u2013 which would include a tougher military component than that favored by President Barack Obama. Her willingness to sketch out such aggressive policies suggested that Clinton feels that she\u2019s in a strong position in the Democratic Party even if many activists are to her left on national security. Clinton\u2019s decision to lay out a detailed policy on ISIS amounted to an appeal to undecided and independent voters in the presidential race, amid polls showing that the public has lost confidence in Obama on these issues. She also risked angering parts of the Democratic base on taxes, with a George H.W. Bush-like vow not to raise taxes on the middle class. \u201cThat is a pledge that I\u2019m making,\u201d Clinton said, staking out a position that also seemed geared more to a general election than a primary in which some progressives would prefer higher taxes to finance more government programs. While Clinton sailed through the debate without significant political damage, the event did point to potential vulnerabilities on national security that Republicans will be sure to exploit should they face her in a general election. \u201cWe now finally are where we need to be. We have a strategy and a commitment to go after ISIS,\u201d Clinton said, in a statement that appeared to put her at odds with public opinion. Her comment drew an immediate response from Republican candidate Jeb Bush. \u201cNo @HillaryClinton - We are not \u201cwhere we need to be\u201d in fight against ISIS,\u201d Bush said on Twitter. Clinton also again struggled to explain her role in advocating military action in Libya in 2011 that resulted in the overthrow of longtime dictator Moammar Gadhafi but left behind a failed state, parts of which have become a haven for ISIS. That issue is sure to be a key exhibit in the Republican case that her record as secretary of state and what GOP candidates see as a disastrous period of U.S. confusion and retreat abroad should disqualify her from being president. And although her answer to a question on how her husband Bill Clinton would fit into the role of presidential spouse should she win the White House was lighthearted, her response that \u201cI am probably still going to pick the flowers and the china for state dinners and stuff like that\u201d could perhaps be seized on by GOP opponents as a sign that she is already metaphorically measuring the drapes in the White House. But for now, Clinton appears to be well positioned to ease through the Democratic primary and take the fight to her preferred targets in the Republican Party. \u201cYou know, everybody says every election\u2019s important, and there\u2019s truth to that. This is a watershed election. I know how important it is that we have a Democrat succeed President Obama in the White House,\u201d Clinton said in her closing statement, before making a quip which suggested that the restoration of tried-and-tested franchises from another era \u2013 be it in movies like Star Wars or in politics \u2013 could work. \u201cThank you, good night and may the force be with you.\u201d",

            "article_content": "The Democratic candidates square off in New Hampshire The DNC data breach might not have been an issue but Donald Trump was With the Iowa caucuses just around the corner, the Democratic primary contenders gathered in New Hampshire on Saturday night for their third and final debate of 2015. Democratic debate in New Hampshire For the Americans not on the road ahead of the holidays or watching NFL football, Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders and Martin O\u2019Malley provided the entertainment, engaging in a substantive if somewhat dry policy forum. But the candidates answered some big questions and offered a glimpse of what\u2019s to come as this 2016 race hits the stretch run. Sanders said he was sorry, Clinton accepted his apology, and that was that. The harshest back-and-forth of the Democratic primary contest ended with a whimper, just minutes into the debate. But detente was no given. In the runup to the debate, staffers from both campaigns had sniped and griped at each other over the revelation that Sanders aides had improperly accessed Clinton\u2019s voter database. Sanders fired his digital director when the story went public, but the DNC stoked the flames \u2013 helped along by some hot language from the Clinton campaign \u2013 by banning the Sanders campaign from seeing their own information. Sanders campaign sues DNC after database breach But that tough talk over the last couple of days was mostly absent during Sanders\u2019 and Clinton\u2019s cordial on-stage exchange. \u201cI don\u2019t think the American people are all that interested in this,\u201d Clinton said, channeling the senator\u2019s own declaration in a previous debate about moving on from her \u201cdamn emails.\u201d As expected, everyone had a go at the Republican front-runner. O\u2019Malley called Trump a \u201cfascist\u201d about five minutes into the show and Sanders dismissed his message as demagoguery aimed at the economically distressed. Clinton weighed in, too. \u201cHe is becoming ISIS\u2019s best recruiter,\u201d she said. \u201cThey are going to people showing videos of Donald Trump insulting Islam and Muslims in order to recruit more radical jihadists.\u201d While the first line is familiar \u2013 many have suggested Trump\u2019s anti-Muslim rhetoric could or will be used by terror groups to boost recruiting \u2013 there is no evidence so far that the real estate developer has been shown in ISIS videos as a marketing tool, as CNN\u2019s Reality Check team determined. She still has a nomination to win, but Clinton offered a few instructive lines on what her general election campaign might look like. The front-runner began the evening with a wide-ranging broadside, telling the partisan audience, \u201cWe have to prevent the Republicans from rolling back the progress that we\u2019ve made.\u201d \u201cThey would repeal the Affordable Care Act, not improve it,\u201d she said. \u201cThey would give more tax breaks to the super-wealthy and corporations, not to the middle class. And they would, despite all their tough talk about terrorism, continue to let people who are on the no-fly list buy guns.\u201d Tax hikes on the middle-class, Clinton said, were \u201coff the table,\u201d while the former senator from New York was careful to play nice with Wall Street and big business. \u201cShould corporate America love Hillary Clinton?\u201d ABC moderator David Muir asked. \u201cEverbody should,\u201d Clinton replied to laughs from the audience. (Sanders, by contrast, said CEOs \u201cain\u2019t going to like me and Wall Street is going to like me even less.\u201d) Clinton dismissed some of the troubles facing Obamacare as \u201cglitches,\u201d doubling down on her support for the President\u2019s controversial health care reform. Clinton also offered a quick glimpse at how she might manage questions about her 2011 decision to support regime change in Libya. Challenged by Sanders on her policy there, the former secretary of state seemed to accuse him of playing Monday morning quarterback. \u201cWith all due respect,\u201d Clinton said, \u201cyou voted for regime change with respect to Libya.\u201d It\u2019s a line she could just as easily use in a debate with Marco Rubio, who also supported \u201cmilitary action\u201d against the Gadhafi regime. Liberals might not love all of the answers, but a look back at the questions makes a convincing case that progressives are gaining new power in the Democratic Party\u2019s larger debate. College cost and debt, criminal justice reform, and the relationship between police and communities of color are no longer throw-ins \u2014 each candidate has gone to considerable length in addressing the related concerns, something not seen even eight years ago, when Clinton and Obama were jockeying for the nomination. No matter who prevails in this contest, the discussion has drifted left \u2014 and that\u2019s good news for progressives pining for a seat at the table, although less clear-cut for how they will fare in the general election campaign. \u201cMay the force be with you!\u201d Clinton said at the end of her closing statement Saturday night. But there was another, mysterious force at play about an hour earlier. After a commercial break, ABC returned to a stage missing one very important fixture: Hillary Clinton. The candidate was about 30 seconds late getting back to her lectern, arriving as Muir began asking a question despite her absence. Upon re-entering the stage, Clinton offered a droll, \u201cSorry\u2026\u201d She seemed, much to the delight of supporters miffed that show went on without her, to be anything but that.",

The Washington event was an attempt by the front-runner\u2019s campaign to flex its establishment muscle as the first caucuses and primaries draw closer, but one Democratic leader was notably missing from the stage that hosted all the women: Sen. Elizabeth Warren. Clinton never mentioned Warren\u2019s absence \u2013 and ignored the questions when asked about it after the event, instead choosing to focus on her platform and the future of women in the Senate. \u201cWe are going to do everything we can to put our country on the right track,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cAnd I am hoping that because of the election next year, this time we will be able to celebrate more Democratic senators and maybe even taking the majority of the Senate back.\u201d RELATED: Obama holds out on Hillary Clinton endorsement Despite signing a letter that urged Clinton to run for president in 2013, Warren has so far declined to officially endorse her campaign. The senator, who liberal organizers failed to draft into a presidential campaign for much of 2014 and 2015, told CNN earlier this year that the letter she signed was not an endorsement for the Clinton campaign. But on Monday night, Warren stood alone. Sens. Tammy Baldwin, Barbara Boxer, Maria Cantwell, Dianne Feinstein, Kirsten Gillibrand, Heidi Heitkamp, Mazie Hirono, Amy Klobuchar, Claire McCaskill, Barbara Mikulski, Patty Murray, Jeanne Shaheen and Debbie Stabenow \u2013 every other Democratic woman senator \u2013 spoke on Clinton\u2019s behalf, offering praise of the woman many of them once served with. \u201cIt is without a doubt that the single most qualified, by far, of any person in this race for president, is Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton,\u201d said Heitkamp of North Dakota. \u201cWhen women vote, women win and Hillary Clinton will be the next president of the United States,\u201d added Gillibrand of New York. New Hampshire\u2019s Shaheen pledged that Clinton would in her state\u2019s early nominating primary. And Klobuchar, of Minnesota, assured the audience of nearly 1,000 people that Clinton is \u201cgoing to win Iowa,\u201d the first in the nation caucus. \u201cJust like all of us, she still puts her pant suits on one leg at a time,\u201d said Washington\u2019s Murray, winning laughs from the other women. Clinton has a stranglehold on the U.S. Senate, with 38 of the 46 \u2013 or 83% \u2013 of senators who caucus with the Democrats have already endorsed Clinton.  That despite one of their own \u2013 Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders \u2013 running against the former first lady. Warren is one of the few who has yet to endorse and her spokeswoman did not respond to questions about why the senator was not attending. \u201cI am not sure why she wasn\u2019t (here). Maybe she has a cold,\u201d Sen. Barbara Mikulski said after the event, her tongue firmly in cheek. The event was a symbolic one for Clinton, a former member of the Senate. Her campaign has looked to give supporters a chance to attend the gathering, too, blasting out an email from Gillibrand earlier this month that asked supporters to enter for a chance to attend. Clinton told the audience that she would spend more on infrastructure, affordable education and fighting climate change, and pledged not to raise taxes on middle-class Americans. \u201cI will not raise taxes on middle-class families because they have to get back to where they were before they fell into that ditch of the great recession,\u201d she said. The campaign also rolled out a new video \u2013 titled \u201c44 Boys Is Too Many\u201d \u2013 that featured young girls reading letters they wrote to Clinton and speaking about the need for a woman president. \u201cIf Hillary Clinton was the president,\u201d says one girl, \u201cthen a lot of girls could be the president. Then I could be president, and all the girls after that could be president.\u201d Tickets to the event ran between $250 to $2,700, the max donation for a primary campaign. Hosts were being asked to raise $27,000. The fundraiser is also unique in that it is the first of 153 such events that\u2019s open to the press.",

Christopher Coons endorsed Hillary Clinton Tuesday on CNN's New Day Coons was a vocal supporter of Vice President Joe Biden hoping he'd enter the race Democratic Sen. Chris Coons of Delaware endorsed Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 presidential bid on CNN\u2019s \u201cNew Day\u201d on Tuesday, saying the former Secretary of State has the best shot at winning the general election. \u201cAcross a wide range of issues from college access to manufacturing, from foreign policy to leadership, I\u2019m thrilled to be endorsing her today in her run for president,\u201d he told CNN\u2019s Alisyn Camerota. Coons said he chose Clinton over fellow Senator Bernie Sanders because of her economic positions. \u201cI just think we need an economic message of optimism that focuses on growth as well as one that looks with a clear eye about some of the issues about income equality that Bernie has raised,\u201d he said.

And I was hopeful that he would be running for president. I think his voice for our middle class has been unequaled, but I think he\u2019s made the right choice for his family,\u201d Coons said. Coons, a member of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, was also optimistic about the future relationship between the U.S. and Israel following Monday\u2019s meeting between President Barack Obama and Israel Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. \u201cThere are many who suggested that our strong disagreements over the Iran Nuclear Deal may have permanently frayed the U.S.-Israel relationship.

Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island- Told The Hill in January 2014 that he was backing Clinton. Not all senators, however, are ready to endorse Clinton this early. Delaware Sen. Tom Carper has side-stepped questions about Hillary Clinton 2016, largely because of uncertainty around whether Vice President Joe Biden \u2013 a Delaware native \u2013 would run. Pennsylvania Sen. Bob Casey told CNN last year that it was too early to endorse. Here is the list of not yet and nos to Clinton 2016: Sen.

Bernie Sanders of Vermont - The independent senator is Clinton\u2019s strongest primary challenger. Some senators have been unclear about their support of Clinton in 2016.

But he has not directly said that he is support her possible run. Here is the list of senators whose support is unclear: Sen. Michael Bennet of Colorado - The Colorado Democrat sent an email through Ready for Hillary in 2014, but to date, has not made it clear that he would back her run in 2016. Sen.

Ed Markey of Massachusetts Sen. Robert Menendez of New Jersey Sen. Jeff Merkley of Oregon Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut Sen. Gary Peters of Michigan - Clinton endorsed Peters in 2014 and although Peters hinted at Clinton\u2019s future, he didn\u2019t outright endorse her. \u201cWhatever she does, she is going to be really great at it in the future,\u201d he said at the event with Clinton. Sen. Jack Reed of Rhode Island Sen. Harry Reid of Nevada Sen. Jon Tester of Montana - After losing the chamber in 2014, the Montana Democrat was named chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee through 2016. Sen. Tom Udall of New Mexico Sen.

            "article_content": "Jeb Bush turned another question about football into a soundbite on the campaign trail in New Hampshire After admitting he didn't know much about the scandal at first, he argued that \"Deflategate\" is \"not going to be on my list of things to fret about. I worry about rising income for the middle class. That's what I worry about\" At Jeb Bush\u2019s final stop of a three-day, nine-event tour in New Hampshire, there was an awkward pause Thursday afternoon that he filled with his thoughts on fantasy football. Bush was taking questions from a group of employees at a medical device company here in Somersworth, and there was suddenly a lull in questions, so Bush brought up a local hero: the New England Patriots\u2019 tight end. \u201cAnyone got Gronkowski in your fantasy football?\u201d he asked, adding that his team is now 8-0. \u201cGronkowski is just kicking you-know-what. So I\u2019m turning into a Pats fan little by little just because of this.\u201d Jeb Bush's life The small audience broke out into applause and cheers. Playing off the sudden burst of enthusiasm, Bush talked about going to high school with the Patriots coach, Bill Belichick.\u201dHe\u2019s the greatest coach in NFL history. He\u2019s such a warm and fuzzy guy, too,\u201d he said with sarcasm. Then he was asked by a voter to state his position on the \u201cDeflategate\u201d scandal. Bush started answering the question, saying he hadn\u2019t been paying close attention to the controversy and admitted that he previously misunderstood what it actually was. Then his media coaching kicked into gear. Jeb Bush says Fantasy Football should be regulated In last week\u2019s CNBC debate, Bush was asked if there should be more regulation of fantasy football. Bush, who tends to answers the questions he\u2019s asked rather than dodging them or pivoting them to campaign talking point, said there could be some regulation. VIDEO: Jeb supporter: Bush has 12 days to fix debate struggles But Chris Christie quickly jumped in, rousing the audience to loud applause when he blasted the question as ridiculous media bias and said the government has more important issues to deal with rather than worry about fantasy football. It was a moment that demonstrated what\u2019s become a weakness for Bush in a cutthroat Republican primary: He tries to play by the rules. Jeb Bush\u2019s existential crisis But his team has hired a consultant to train him to play like the others on stage and not treat it like an actual debate. \u201cIt\u2019s a chance to be able to say what you think. I\u2019m going to take advantage of that,\u201d he told reporters Wednesday on his campaign bus. That includes not answering questions like he\u2019s used to. Who's running for President? 2016 election candidates So when it came time Thursday to give his take on \u201cDeflategate,\u201d Bush seamlessly turned the answer into a soundbite. After admitting he didn\u2019t know much about the scandal at first, he argued that \u201cDeflategate\u201d is \u201cnot going to be on my list of things to fret about. I worry about rising income for the middle class. That\u2019s what I worry about.\u201d \u201cWe obsess about some really interesting things\u2026that are like great topics of conversation and we kind of don\u2019t obsess about the things that are like hugely important \u2013 the heroin epidemic in New Hampshire, declining income for the middle class, six million people stuck in poverty,\u201d he continued. \u201cThere\u2019s some big issues that we need to focus on. Deflategate is just a diversion that kind of keeps us entertained.\u201d Just for good measure, Bush still closed the circle with a nod to the Patriot fans sitting in front of him. \u201cI\u2019d take Brady any day of the week against any quarterback, how about that?\u201d he added. \u201cAs long as he has Gronkowski.\u201d",

The bill, already cleared by the House, now goes to President Barack Obama, who is expected to sign it. The vote was 64 to 35. The measure, which suspends the nation\u2019s debt limit through March 2017 and increases federal spending for domestic and defense programs by more than $80 billion over the next two years, had broad support from Democrats but limited support from Republicans, many of whom complained the deal, brokered by bipartisan congressional leaders, contained too much spending. GOP presidential candidate Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky forced a rare overnight Senate session when he filibustered the bill. \u201cThe right\u2019s going to get more military money, the left\u2019s going to get more welfare money. The secret handshake goes on, and the American public gets stuck with the bill,\u201d he said in a speech on the floor Thursday afternoon. \u201cThis deal will do nothing but explode the debt.\u201d Sen. Pat Toomey, a conservative Republican facing a tough re-election campaign in Pennsylvania, said the bill \u201cfails to address our overspending problem.\u201d Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, who helped force the last government shutdown in 2013, said the deal gives Obama a \u201cdiamond-encrusted, glow-in-the-dark AmEx card.\u201d \u201cAnd it has a special feature,\u201d Cruz continued. \u201cThe President gets to spend it now, and they don\u2019t even send him the bill. They send the bill to your kids and my kids. It\u2019s a pretty nifty card. You don\u2019t have to pay for it. You get to spend it and it\u2019s somebody else\u2019s problem.\u201d Other Republicans \u2013 including those who work regularly across the aisle \u2013 complained too. \u201cThe agreement reached by the White House and congressional leaders is yet another example of what the American people hate about Washington,\u201d said Sen. Bob Corker of Tennessee, who criticized the deal for relying on budget \u201cgimmicks.\u201d The concerns by Senate Republicans were consistent with those of House Republicans, most of whom voted against the deal when it passed the House on Wednesday. But it was never really in doubt that Senate Republicans, led by their leadership, would provide enough votes to clear the Senate to ensure the U.S. would not default on its debt. Democrats insisted the agreement was worthwhile. \u201cThe budget agreement is good for the middle class, good for the economy, and good for the country,\u201d said Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid, who worked quietly with bipartisan leaders in the House and Senate to cut the deal. And Obama said Friday morning that he applauded both parties for the bill\u2019s passage. \u201cIt is paid for in a responsible, balanced way \u2013 in part with a measure to ensure that partnerships like hedge funds pay what they owe in taxes just like everybody else. It locks in two years of funding and should help break the cycle of shutdowns and manufactured crises that have harmed our economy,\u201d Obama said in a statement. The vote came hours after former House Speaker John Boehner retired and turned over the top House position to Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wisconsin. Passage of the bill means Ryan can begin his new job with a slate cleaned of some of the most controversial issues before the Congress.",

Former Delaware Sen. Ted Kaufman, a member of Biden\u2019s close inner circle, sent the email below Thursday to a network of Biden alumni, obtained by CNN, saying that while he doesn\u2019t know when Biden will decide, he knows Biden is aware of the ticking clock. Dear friend, A lot of you are being asked, and have asked me, about the direction and timing of the Vice President\u2019s thinking about a run for President.  On the second question - timing - I can\u2019t add much, except I am confident that the Vice President is aware of the practical demands of making a final decision soon.  He has been in public and political life a long time and he has a good grip on the mechanics around this decision. But on the first question, I know him well, and have spoken with him extensively about this issue.  It will not surprise you, as it does not surprise me, what he will weigh in the decision and what - being Joe Biden - he will not. All of you know well that the first and foremost consideration will be the welfare and support of his family.  That\u2019s Joe Biden.  He has been clear about this and it is as true today as it has been for the past several months.  He is determined to take, and to give his family, as much time as possible to work this through. But then the question is what kind of Presidential campaign he believes he would run, and what kind of President he believes he can be.  If he runs, he will run because of his burning conviction that we need to fundamentally change the balance in our economy and the political structure to restore the ability of the middle class to get ahead.  And whether we can a political consensus in America to get it done And what kind of campaign?  An optimistic campaign. A campaign from the heart. A campaign consistent with his values, our values, and the values of the American people. And I think it\u2019s fair to say, knowing him as we all do, that it won\u2019t be a scripted affair\u2013 after all, it\u2019s Joe. He believes we must win this election. Everything he and the President have worked for \u2013 and care about \u2013 is at stake. I know in the daily ups and down of the political swirl, we all get bombarded with the tactics. So sometimes it\u2019s good to take a step back and get real again. Let\u2019s stay in touch. If he decides to run, we will need each and every one of you \u2013 yesterday! Ted",

            "article_content": "Vice President Joe Biden has been calling operatives about how -- not whether -- to launch a presidential bid \"His family is totally on board,\" one top Democrat who has spoken to Biden this week told CNN, Vice President Joe Biden has personally made a series of calls this week to Democratic strategists from Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina, asking a final round of detailed questions about how \u2013 not whether \u2013 to launch a 2016 presidential campaign. People familiar with the conversations tell CNN that Biden has been making the calls throughout the week, including on Wednesday, just as many leading Democrats argued the window to a potential candidacy was closing in the wake of Hillary Clinton\u2019s strong performance in the party\u2019s first presidential debate. He is asking these people to work for him if he runs. The first Democratic debate The vice president has been making  clear that his family is fully supportive of him jumping into the 2016 race, according to people familiar with the calls. They are guided by the belief that he has the best chance of keeping the White House in Democratic hands and he could forever regret taking a pass at another shot at the presidency. The new round of calls this week \u2013 from the vice president himself, not simply his top advisers \u2013 suggest Biden is finally moving toward announcing a decision. He has been down this road before, inching close to a run but pulling back, so his next steps are far from certain. Biden has not shared the timing of his decision or announcement with people he is calling this week. One senior party official said the announcement is expected in the next three days, while other Democrats say Biden may wait for a week or more. He will reveal his decision before month\u2019s end.

Ted Kaufman, a member of Biden\u2019s close inner circle, sent an email late Thursday to a network of Biden alumni, obtained by CNN, saying that while he doesn\u2019t know when Biden will decide, he knows Biden is aware of the ticking clock. \u201cOn the second question - timing - I can\u2019t add much, except I am confident that the vice president is aware of the practical demands of making a final decision soon,\u201d Kaufman wrote. \u201cHe has been in public and political life a long time and he has a good grip on the mechanics around this decision.\u201d READ: Sen. Ted Kaufman\u2019s email Biden allies Biden is still leaving the impression this week that he wants to join the race, people familiar with the calls say, and does not seem dissuaded by the argument that he could complicate the party\u2019s nominating fight or damage his own reputation. Biden faces hurdles as he weighs late 2016 bid Joe Biden: Images from a political life \u201cHis family is totally on board,\u201d one top Democrat who has spoken to Biden this week told CNN, speaking on condition of anonymity to discuss the private conversation. \u201cHe wants to do this.\u201d Biden: I \u2018would not hesitate\u2019 to run in 2016 if family can handle race Kaufman did not in his email prognosticate on whether Biden would jump in, but wrote about what he thought might go into his decision making. He said family support was crucial and that Biden would run an \u201coptimistic campaign.\u201d \u201cIf he runs, he will run because of his burning conviction that we need to fundamentally change the balance in our economy and the political structure to restore the ability of the middle class to get ahead.  And whether we can a political consensus in America to get it done,\u201d Kaufman wrote. The question of whether he has waited too long comes up in the conversations, people familiar with his calls say, which could be the most important remaining consideration in his decision. It could also provide an exit strategy for him if he ultimately decides against running after doing little to quiet weeks of speculation. The arguments in favor of running, according to people who have spoken with the Vice President and his team of advisers, include: One potential point of entry into the race comes October 24 at Iowa\u2019s Jefferson-Jackson Day Dinner, when thousands of party activists will descend on Des Moines. If he decides to vigorously campaign for the Iowa caucuses in February, his supporters believe this is a moment that shouldn\u2019t be missed, given the high-profile event is attracting the rest of the party\u2019s top candidates. Who's running for President? 2016 election candidates Yet a Biden candidacy is also challenging. The campaign has moved quickly - even more so in recent weeks - and Biden would have to work to compete with his fellow Democrats at that Iowa dinner. It\u2019s remembered for being a break-out moment for Obama in 2007. But Katy Perry is scheduled to perform for Clinton that night. The question is whether Biden can compete \u2013 or catch up \u2013 with a race that\u2019s been underway for months. Biden himself teased the press earlier Thursday when he was repeatedly asked about whether he would run for president. \u201cI\u2019ll talk to you all about that later,\u201d Biden told members of the media earlier in the day, after laughing at their 2016-related questions. Kaufman closed his email by reminding Biden alums that they could be called upon \u2013 and soon. \u201cI know in the daily ups and down of the political swirl, we all get bombarded with the tactics. So sometimes it\u2019s good to take a step back and get real again,\u201d Kaufman wrote. \u201cLet\u2019s stay in touch. If he decides to run, we will need each and every one of you \u2013 yesterday!\u201d CNN\u2019s Jim Acosta, John King, David Chalian and Tal Kopan contributed to this report.",

Bernie Sanders says the federal budget deficit is a \u201cserious problem\u201d \u2013 but he\u2019s not backing away from potentially pricey policy proposals. Bernie Sanders' political career In an interview with NBC\u2019s Chuck Todd set to air Sunday on \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d the Democratic presidential contender said he\u2019d pay for his plans \u2013 including $1 trillion for infrastructure and a \u201cMedicare for all\u201d health insurance system \u2013 through higher taxes on wealthy Americans and corporations that keep profits outside the country. \u201cYou take a hard look at our tax system,\u201d Sanders said when pressed about how he\u2019d address the deficit. \u201cAnd you say, \u2018You know what? Corporate America, you ain\u2019t going to stash your money in the Cayman Islands and not pay any taxes at all,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cIf you are very, very wealthy, as Warren Buffett reminds us, you know what? You\u2019re not going to continue to pay an effective tax rate lower than middle class people.\u201d Sanders pointed to wars in Iraq and Afghanistan \u201cthat our Republican friends got us into and forgot to pay for,\u201d as well as George W. Bush-era tax cuts for the wealthy and for corporations, as the culprits for a national debt that has topped $18 trillion and increases each year. 2016 election candidates Who's running for President? He said he still wants to adopt a \u201cMedicare for all\u201d insurance system, extending the government program\u2019s coverage to all Americans \u2013 which one estimate suggested would cost $15 trillion over 10 years. \u201cMy Republican friends want to throw millions of more people off of health insurance,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd what I want to do is have the United States of America join the rest of the industrialized world, every other country in guaranteeing health care to all people.\u201d Scott Walker\u2019s health care plan: Repeal Obamacare, replace it with conservative alternative He defended several other new spending proposals in the interview, as well \u2013 highlighting his calls for new investments in infrastructure and college education. \u201cI want to invest a trillion dollars in rebuilding our crumbling infrastructure. I do want to do that because I think that will create up to 13 million jobs,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cSo is deficit reduction important? Of course, it is,\u201d he said. \u201cBut so is creating the millions of jobs we desperately need. So is making public colleges and universities tuition free.\u201d",

            "article_content": "President Barack Obama got much closer Monday to locking in a major part of his legacy: the biggest regional free trade deal in history. But first he has to win the political battle in Congress and on the 2016 presidential campaign trail. Trade negotiators\u2019 announcement that they\u2019ve reached a deal on the 12-country Trans-Pacific Partnership starts the clock on a politically fraught process that will drop the deal into a combustible Congress, where populists in both parties oppose it, in the midst of a presidential campaign. And 2016 candidates will weigh in \u2013 some with the potential to fan the flames of discontent on Capitol Hill and with both parties\u2019 most loyal voters. Who's running for President? The most intense scrutiny will fall on Hillary Clinton, the Democratic front-runner who was Obama\u2019s first-term secretary of state but has been mum on the Pacific Rim deal since launching her presidential campaign. She\u2019s sandwiched between Obama, whose work on the Trans-Pacific Partnership extends the legacy of the North American Free Trade Agreement signed by Bill Clinton, and a Democratic base that has long soured on those pacts, arguing that they cause the United States to bleed jobs and wages \u2013 in some cases to countries without protections for workers and the environment. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, Clinton\u2019s liberal rival, has already emailed supporters about blocking the \u201cdisastrous\u201d deal. \u201cWall Street and other big corporations have won again,\u201d Sanders said in a statement. \u201cIt is time for the rest of us to stop letting multi-national corporations rig the system to pad their profits at our expense.\u201d Bernie Sanders challenges Hillary Clinton\u2019s trade record On the right, there is much less ideological resistance to free trade \u2013 and in fact it was the new Republican House and Senate majorities that in June helped Obama seal the Pacific Rim deal by approving a bill that greased the wheels for its ultimate passage. But GOP 2016 front-runner Donald Trump has bucked the party orthodoxy. He has blasted the Pacific deal, called for crackdowns on currency manipulation that aren\u2019t typically included in trade talks and even said he\u2019d re-negotiate NAFTA. Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders share some opinions on trade \u201cThe incompetence of our current administration is beyond comprehension. TPP is a terrible deal,\u201d Trump tweeted Monday afternoon. The incompetence of our current administration is beyond comprehension. TPP is a terrible deal. Other outsider candidates like Carly Fiorina and Ben Carson haven\u2019t been as critical as Trump, but they\u2019ve signaled some problems of their own with the deal. What would imperil the Trans-Pacific Partnership the most is populists in both parties joining arms in an effort to defeat it in Congress. Already, most Democrats are resistant to the deal. Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts has led the opposition, highlighting the deal\u2019s inclusion of an international arbiter to settle disputes between companies and governments that impose regulations that might violate their trade obligations. Some conservatives have also opposed what they\u2019ve dubbed \u201cObamatrade,\u201d warning that they don\u2019t trust anything that the President negotiates. Obama started making his pitch to the American people and Congress shortly after the 12 participating nations\u2019 trade ministers Monday morning announced \u2013 after extending their stay during a negotiating session in Atlanta, where this round of talks took place, by four more days than they\u2019d planned. \u201cIf we can get this agreement to my desk, then we can help our businesses sell more Made in America goods and services around the world, and we can help more American workers compete and win,\u201d Obama said in a statement. It\u2019s a deal years in the making. What evolved into the Trans-Pacific Partnership started as a small, regional negotiation late in George W. Bush\u2019s second term. Countries were added along the way \u2013 but it was when Japan joined the talks in 2013 that the deal gained serious heft, opening a massive new market for automotive and agricultural exports and easing the process of selling more products like liquefied natural gas. The deal also includes Canada and Mexico \u2013 the countries that struck the North American Free Trade Agreement with the United States two decades ago. Negotiators had been hung up on a short list of issues for months \u2013 and in some cases, years. The United States and Japan were squaring off over agriculture and automotives. U.S. pharmaceutical companies sought longer patent protections, while developing Asian countries wanted quicker access to inexpensive generics. New Zealand was pushing for more access to the Canadian and U.S. dairy markets. And negotiators for each country knew every concession they made would risk provoking political fights back home that could imperil the deal. Announcing a deal was just a first step. The 12 countries must put the finishing touches on the text and translate it into each of their languages \u2013 a process likely to take months. Then, it must win approval in each country \u2013 and clearing Congress in the midst of a presidential election will be no small task. The same issues that caused negotiators to stay four extra days in Atlanta are certain to prove controversial on Capitol Hill and on the campaign trail. Lawmakers took the first step toward passage of the Trans-Pacific Partnership when the Republican-led House and Senate both approved a measure known as \u201ctrade promotion authority.\u201d That means the pact will be submitted to Congress for an up-or-down vote without amendments \u2013 preventing U.S. negotiators from having to return to the table and ask other countries to agree to last-minute changes. In his statement, Obama touted the potential benefits of the deal. \u201cThis partnership levels the playing field for our farmers, ranchers, and manufacturers by eliminating more than 18,000 taxes that various countries put on our products,\u201d Obama said. \u201cIt includes the strongest commitments on labor and the environment of any trade agreement in history, and those commitments are enforceable, unlike in past agreements. It promotes a free and open Internet. It strengthens our strategic relationships with our partners and allies in a region that will be vital to the 21st century,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s an agreement that puts American workers first and will help middle-class families get ahead.\u201d",

            "article_content": "In early September, in the small New Hampshire town of Berlin, there were two Bernie Sanders signs along Main Street. Meanwhile, down the block, a sign on Hillary Clinton\u2019s Berlin office announced it would be fully operational six days a week. Sanders had just surpassed Hillary Clinton in the polls and was drawing crowds as large as 1,000 people in the state, much larger than his four-person New Hampshire staff had ever seen before. Five weeks later, the Vermont senator drew more than 3,000 people at an event held at the University of New Hampshire \u2013 five times Clinton\u2019s audience on the same campus. Bernie Sanders' political career A week after that, an empty storefront on Main Street in Berlin was blanketed with Sanders signs and volunteers were inside, busy putting up decorations, phone-banking and inputting data after canvassing the neighborhood. The majority of the posts on BernieSanders.com no longer listed events involving only the senator: There was a volunteer rally in Littleton, door-knocking in Nashua and canvassing in Claremont, Hudson, Salem and Berlin. On Saturday night more than 20,000 people attended Sanders\u2019 campaign event in nearby Boston. Sanders\u2019 infrastructure now rivals Clinton\u2019s in New Hampshire, with more than 40 staffers in the state and nine offices. If August was when Granite State voters started turning out in mass for Sanders, September is when his campaign finally started to build an operation to match it. Julia Barnes, Sanders\u2019 New Hampshire state director, started in early August and said her first two weeks were consumed with interviewing new staff. \u201cIt\u2019s been a meteoric rise in the amount of staff that we have, but our challenge is making sure that our infrastructure can support as many people as want to work,\u201d she said. Barnes told CNN that it\u2019s been surreal to see the enthusiasm for Sanders. Most advertising for events takes no more than a post on social media sites and an email blast. Opinion: The Bernie Sanders surge That enthusiasm comes in the form of supporters like six-year-old Iain Duggan, who was at a Sanders\u2019 town hall in Berlin with his family and is such a dedicated fan he decided to take a selfie in the middle aisle while Sanders was speaking. The family is hard to miss at events, as they often show up with Sanders\u2019 name spelled out on their T-shirts. The kids are too young to go out and canvas but they want to help in any way they can, traveling around the state every weekend, making drawings to decorate the offices and hanging up the many pictures they\u2019ve taken of Sanders at events. But at the end of the day, that kind of enthusiasm and big events don\u2019t equal winning the primary. \u201cThe only number that matters to anybody is the win number, right?\u201d Barnes told CNN. \u201cI\u2019m looking to build an infrastructure that\u2019s going to take the energy that started before us and funnel it into something real. The biggest part of any campaign is spending the time and investing the resources in recruiting, training and motivating volunteers.\u201d That infrastructure is something that Clinton\u2019s team has been building in the state for far longer, not to mention endorsements from key New Hampshire figures within the local and federal government like Gov. Maggie Hassan and Sen. Jeanne Shaheen. The state\u2019s largest public union, the National Education of Association in New Hampshire, announced its backing of the former secretary of state ahead of the national organization\u2019s endorsement of Clinton on Saturday. Sanders was recently endorsed by the New Hampshire branch of the Postal Workers Union, and Barnes said they will be rolling out more endorsements soon, but she\u2019s not looking to build an organization that looks the same as Clinton\u2019s. Part of that means recognizing the enormous network of supporters Sanders has attracted online. But turning that into offline action could be a challenge, and the campaign still does not have a digital director in the state, although Barnes says that will happen soon. Playing catch-up to Clinton\u2019s operation means not only building the staff on the ground, but building relationships within communities to know where the candidate\u2019s supporters live. Dante Scala, a political science professor at the University of New Hampshire, said Sanders should look to Al Gore\u2019s primary campaign against Bill Bradley in 2000 as a model. Gore was an establishment candidate, up against the insurgent Bradley, and ahead in the polls for most of the campaign. When Gore\u2019s team realized their lead had shrunk significantly on primary day in New Hampshire, they relied on old-fashioned door-to-door efforts to get out the vote. Hillary Clinton's career in the spotlight \u201cThey were pretty sure based on demographics \u2013 based on education, on social class \u2013 they knew what areas to hit. The question will be for Sanders, on primary night, if it\u2019s a close battle, can he do the same thing, and will he know where his votes are coming from?\u201d said Scala. \u201cOne out of four Democratic primary voters has actually made up their mind, and so the question is, how do you start to try and anchor some of that enthusiasm and make sure to cement that?\u201d Sanders\u2019 large public events haven\u2019t left much room for the quintessential one-on-one interactions between candidates and voters New Hampshire is known for, but Barnes said smaller events will be planned in the coming months. As Sanders\u2019 campaign looks to build relationships with those voters, they need canvassers showing up in October who are in it for the long haul. Clinton\u2019s team says they have been on the ground for much of the summer, empowering volunteers to take on leadership roles within the campaign. The campaign has also stressed the intimate nature of many of Clinton\u2019s New Hampshire events, saying that direct engagement with the candidate allows the campaign to make important inroads in communities. \u201cWe do voter contact and voter activity seven days a week. We have not let up,\u201d Clinton state director Mike Vlacich told CNN. \u201cAll of this is part of a strategy of building deep connections to the people so that you can withstand the ups and downs of campaigns that come with every candidate.\u201d Banking on the long haul is a necessity for Clinton right now, she is trailing Sanders in the latest WMUR/CNN poll of Democratic primary voters, 46% to 30%. Clinton\u2019s campaign also raised only slightly more than Sanders\u2019 in third quarter fundraising numbers, with most of Sanders\u2019 haul coming from his online operation. At a recent organizing house party in Nashua, Jason Rodier, an independent who works at a local machine shop, said he was frustrated he kept receiving requests for donations to Sanders\u2019 campaign after he signed up on the website to volunteer. But when Rodier was finally able to get a hold of a staffer over email, he found out the Nashua campaign office was opening right next door to his house. He has already done some phone-banking and plans to go canvassing. At the house party, Rodier told fellow supporters he views Sanders\u2019 campaign as the kind of grassroots change that came out of the country\u2019s past civil rights movements. \u201cGive us the mechanism, teach us how to establish, re-establish, that sense of community, that sense of everybody being able to push in one direction,\u201d he said. For Sanders\u2019 supporters, the election is not just about electing a candidate, it\u2019s the idea of launching the revolution the Vermont senator is calling for. \u201cI don\u2019t want to miss this moment, and I kind of feel like if I do, and I don\u2019t put my all into this thing, than I might be missing our time, our chance to do that thing. Because fundamental change needs to happen,\u201d Rodier said.",

            "article_content": "Marcia Keefer watched Martin O\u2019Malley methodically work the room at a recent Democratic fundraiser in Davenport, Iowa, and readily acknowledged she knew nothing about the former Maryland governor. \u201cI have to ask, is he running for something or is he something already?\u201d said Keefer, a retiree attending the Scott County Democratic Party\u2019s fundraiser. Keefer, who said she planned to support Hillary Clinton in next year\u2019s Democratic caucus, wasn\u2019t alone. Almost everyone at the dinner said they knew very little, if anything, about O\u2019Malley. Alternatives to Hillary Clinton 2016 That confusion crystallizes the central challenge O\u2019Malley faces if he decides to pursue a long-shot run for the Democratic presidential nomination. He must find a way to dent the Clinton political machine and prove that he\u2019s a competitive candidate \u2013 not just a backup for progressives who would rather see Elizabeth Warren in the White House. READ: Could Warren-mania hurt progressive Democrats? And it\u2019s in Iowa where O\u2019Malley must stake his ground. Failure here would almost certainly doom his campaign. But if he manages to do better than expected \u2013 or even stage an upset \u2013 O\u2019Malley could emerge as a real challenger for Clinton. Given his reception here this past weekend, there could be a sliver of an opening. After O\u2019Malley delivered a red meat political speech to a room packed with union workers, Keefer left with several O\u2019Malley political signs tucked under her arms. \u201cHe said a lot of things that I wanted to hear and got me all revved up to get out there and get the vote out for Democrats,\u201d said Keefer, who noted that O\u2019Malley had given her second thoughts about who she might support in next year\u2019s Democratic caucus. \u201cHe was wonderful tonight. Just wonderful and I never heard of him.\u201d A similar scene played out several times over O\u2019Malley\u2019s two-day trip to Iowa this past weekend, as he criss-crossed the state, meeting with influential early Democratic voters. He entered many rooms as a blank slate and often walked out to favorable reviews. While O\u2019Malley sees an opening in Iowa, 48 hours on the ground is just one step in his run for the White House. For now, national and Iowa polling consistently indicate Clinton is the prohibitive favorite to win the Democratic nomination. Only 1% of Democratic voters picked O\u2019Malley as the first choice to be their party\u2019s presidential nominee, according to a March CNN/ORC national poll. A Bloomberg Politics/Des Moines Register poll of Iowa Democrats offered similar results. Meanwhile, Clinton is lapping the potential field of candidates with a whopping 62% support among national Democrats in the CNN poll, while 56% of Iowa Democrats favored her. READ: O\u2019Malley \u2018tired\u2019 of Clinton email talk O\u2019Malley recognizes his current standing, but emphasized it is early in the process and that polling will not factor into whether he decides to run for the Democratic nomination. \u201cWhen you start off as potential candidate for president and your name recognition is low, you have to just go from county to county, from town to town and engage people in order to change that around,\u201d O\u2019Malley said in an interview with CNN following a Democratic meeting in Tipton. \u201cI guess another way to say it is this: Look, it is not unusual for there to be an inevitable front-runner early in a contest who has fantastic name recognition, and is therefore inevitable right up until he or she is no longer inevitable.\u201d O\u2019Malley said that\u2019s why he spent two days meeting with Democratic voters in both large and small settings in a state that can propel a candidate to the top of the leader board. \u201cIt is also not unusual \u2013 because of the intimate nature of the campaigns in these early states \u2013 for someone the rest of the country has not yet come to know to suddenly become very well known if they are willing to do the hard work and deliver the needed message for our country in town after town after town across Iowa and New Hampshire,\u201d he said, before jumping in the car for his next event in Cedar Rapids. The spark of interest by Iowa voters who saw O\u2019Malley last weekend stems at least in part from his ability to connect with voters. But he\u2019s also benefiting from fear there won\u2019t be a competitive Democratic contest in Iowa, Clinton\u2019s absence from the stage here and apprehension that Clinton is not liberal enough. READ: Hillary Clinton could end up alone in Iowa \u201cI think there is a little bit of hesitancy on the part of Democrats to jump on the Hillary bandwagon at this point because they are not convinced,\u201d said Larry Hodgden, chair of the Cedar County Democrats. \u201cFor one thing she hasn\u2019t been out here talking to us, and we like to have people come out and see us, obviously. And we don\u2019t know exactly how strong she is going to be for the progressive ideas that most of your active Democrats in Iowa do have.\u201d Iowa Democrats, even those who openly support Clinton, said they would like to see a contested race for the party presidential nomination. A candidate who is battle tested in the primary is inevitably stronger in the general election, Iowa Democrats said in numerous interviews with CNN. Coupled with this sentiment was a strong feeling that it was good for Iowa Democrats to have a competitive battle for the nomination. After all, Iowa Democrats have been sitting on the sideline since 2008 when there was a fierce battle between Clinton, then-Sen. Barack Obama and former Sen. John Edwards to win the caucus. In 2012, Obama faced no primary opposition in his successful bid to win a second term \u2013 leaving all of the political oxygen to Republicans in that year\u2019s open contest for the GOP nomination. \u201cWe are always looking for a second choice,\u201d said Clara Oleson, a retired lawyer from West Branch, who was staffing the \u2018Ready for Hillary\u2019 table at the Cedar County Democrats Off-Year Democratic Caucus. \u201cAnd we take our responsibility seriously to vet candidates.\u201d Oleson cited Clinton\u2019s experience as secretary of state as one of the reasons why she is supporting Clinton\u2019s likely presidential bid. Yet Oleson warned it would be presumptuous to say a Clinton victory is a certainty in next year\u2019s caucus. \u201cThere is no lock,\u201d she said. \u201cThere is no inevitability. Not here.\u201d Over his two-day campaign swing, O\u2019Malley played to the left of the political center as he made his case to Iowa voters during this campaign swing. He railed against Wall Street, emphasized the need to rebuild the middle class, and highlighted his support for issues of particular import to women such as expanded childcare, paid leave, and equal pay. \u201cIt is true that when women succeed, America succeeds,\u201d O\u2019Malley said at the Davenport fundraiser, triggering a standing ovation. He also sought to highlight his work in office both as governor and as mayor of Baltimore \u2013 an introduction of sorts to an audience that knew very little about him. And O\u2019Malley repeated the need to cast aside triangulation \u2013 a political strategy of centrism associated with former President Bill Clinton \u2013 believed to be a veiled criticism of Hillary Clinton. \u201cTriangulation is not a strategy that will move America forward,\u201d O\u2019Malley said in Davenport. The next morning, in the CNN interview, O\u2019Malley would not say his criticism of triangulation was directed at Clinton. \u201cI am referencing a malady in our party that has allowed us to accept half solutions as full responsibility,\u201d he said. O\u2019Malley was also careful in presenting his vision for the future, while not being critical of Obama, whose victory in the 2008 Iowa caucus helped him eventually win the Democratic nomination. READ: O\u2019Malley won\u2019t run for Mikulski\u2019s senate seat in 2016 \u201cPresident Obama has done a lot of good and very difficult things to save us from a second Great Depression,\u201d O\u2019Malley said in the CNN interview. \u201cThe very fact that we have an economy creating jobs now for 60 months in a row is a really positive development. But with wages going down for 12 years, this work is not yet completed. \u2026 We have to bring forward a different and better way of governing in order to get our economy to work for all of us again.\u201d At his final stop in Council Bluffs, O\u2019Malley eyed a guitar in the corner of Dixie Quicks restaurant, where the Pottawattamie County Democrats were holding a fundraising dinner. He turned to his aide and asked, \u201cCan I play a song?\u201d The aide asked the band if that was OK and was given the thumbs up. O\u2019Malley, who plays in a Celtic rock band that bears his name, had his closer. Standing on a small, shaky chair so that the 70 or so people in the back could see him, O\u2019Malley recited similar populist political themes that he had spoken about earlier in the day and the previous night. He then asked the confused audience if they wanted to hear a song and proceeded to play the guitar and sing Passenger\u2019s \u201cScare Away the Dark.\u201d He even coaxed the audience to join him in singing the song\u2019s chorus. This was not O\u2019Malley\u2019s first time visiting Iowa \u2013 he was the keynote speaker at the Iowa Democratic Party\u2019s 2014 State Convention, donated more than $45,000 to Iowa Democrats in the last election cycle and paid the salaries of several Democratic staffers to work in Iowa. Early investments that may pay off if he decides to run for president. On this trip, O\u2019Malley had a team of videographers chronicling his speeches and interactions with Iowa voters \u2013 creating a library of fresh campaign footage if he decides to take the leap. Asked to describe what his campaign would look like if he decides to run, O\u2019Malley told CNN: \u201cIt will be a campaign of ideas and a campaign of principle based on our national interests.\u201d Pressed if it would be a large operation or a run-gun grassroots campaign, O\u2019Malley smiled and said, \u201cWell, first it will be a small campaign and then it will be a really large campaign.\u201d He reiterated that his timeline to make a decision to run for president would happen sometime this spring. Coincidentally, he returns to Iowa next month to headline a dinner for Polk County Democrats.",

            "article_content": "The effort was one of the most aggressive lobbying drives ever to take shape between Congressional Democratic leaders and the Obama White House. Democrats succeeded largely because the lobbying effort to back the deal was far more targeted and relentless than the campaigns aimed at scuttling it. It was late July and nerves at the White House were high. Sen. Chuck Schumer, the New York Democrat, was widely expected to announce his opposition to the Iran deal \u2013 and dozens of other House and Senate Democrats were threatening to revolt against the nuclear agreement and deliver President Barack Obama a devastating blow on the international stage. But weeks before it would become public, the White House won a critical assurance that would dramatically change the outlook in Congress: Sen. Harry Reid would support it. In a private call, the Senate Democratic leader secretly assured Secretary of State John Kerry that he would back the deal, though he would keep quiet about it publicly, Democratic sources said. He promised to help deliver critical information about which Democrats to target \u2013 but Reid himself needed to let about a dozen friends, supporters and donors who were sharply critical of the deal know why he was backing it before his position became public. What ensued was perhaps the most aggressive and coordinated lobbying drive ever to take shape between congressional Democratic leaders and the Obama White House \u2013 which have frequently been at odds over strategy and tactics. It was a strategy that focused exclusively on House and Senate Democrats, ignoring Republicans altogether. And it underscored how sensitive the deal was to a number of Democrats, who feared a sharp backlash from pro-Israel voters and their Republican foes. The Democrats succeeded largely because the lobbying effort to back the deal was far more targeted and relentless than the public push and advertising campaigns aimed at scuttling it, according to lawmakers in both parties. For a president often criticized for being detached from Congress, Obama aggressively used his bully pulpit to win over his party, contacting 125 Democratic House members and senators since July, many of them repeatedly, according to Democratic sources. READ: Senate Democrats protect Obama on Iran vote Tennessee Sen. Bob Corker, the GOP chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and an opponent of the deal, said his Democratic friends reported to him that the White House was \u201cbreaking arms and legs\u201d to prevent Congress from voting down the deal. And it worked, culminating in a Thursday victory where Senate Democrats filibustered a resolution to reject the deal and House Democrats secured enough support to sustain a veto, handing Obama the most far-reaching international achievement of his presidency. To quell a Democratic uprising, the White House, Reid and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi traded key intelligence about uneasy Democrats, dispatching powerful Cabinet officials to lock down support. Over the August recess, Pelosi gave the White House 57 names of House Democrats who were wobbly on the Iran pact; Obama called all of them, including 30 calls to Democratic lawmakers in between rounds of golf during his Martha\u2019s Vineyard vacation, according to Democratic sources. Senate Minority Whip Dick Durbin called almost everyone in his 46-member caucus, interrupting a family vacation in Oregon to lobby skittish Democrats. On a jaunt to Florida last week where he talked about his presidential ambitions, Vice President Joe Biden made a side trip to help woo and eventually win over Florida Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, an influential Jewish Democrat who was facing fierce protests, including from some activists who charged that she should \u201cgo to the oven,\u201d a reference to the Holocaust. Senior administration officials made 250 calls to House members and senators, sources said. That includes Jack Lew, the Treasury secretary and an Orthodox Jew, who was dispatched in part to help alleviate concerns of Jewish lawmakers, and Kerry, a former senator who relied on his longstanding Hill connections to push his party to back the deal. Yet it was Ernest Moniz, the Department of Energy secretary and a nuclear physicist, who became the most prolific and effective surrogate, lawmakers said. Moniz headed to the Detroit area to win over Michigan Sen. Gary Peters this summer. After pro-Israel forces were ratcheting up oppositpion in Montana, Moniz laid out his views to a local newspaper to help ensure Sen. Jon Tester didn\u2019t defect. And he called into a North Dakota radio show to help give political cover to Heidi Heitkamp, the state\u2019s centrist Democratic senator. Moniz was so influential that the final Democrat who announced her support \u2013 Washington Sen. Maria Cantwell \u2013 waited to return to Washington to meet with him to let him reassure her about the capability of inspectors to continue to detect nuclear activity in the country. He told them all that the deal cut off Iran\u2019s pathways to building a nuclear bomb. Reid later privately mused about the possibility of nominating Moniz for the Nobel Peace Prize, according to an aide familiar with the matter. What helped Obama and supporters was the fact that the congressional review law only required the White House to prevent a veto-proof, two-thirds majority from forming in each chamber. With 46 Senate Democrats and 188 House Democrats, that meant limiting defections to fewer than 13 in the Senate and 42 in the House. On Thursday, just four Democrats voted to break a filibuster in the Senate on a motion to disapprove of the Iran deal, keeping the accord alive, with Pelosi\u2019s office announcing it had enough support to sustain a potential veto. Given the more progressive bent in the House Democratic Caucus, the White House always viewed the House as its firewall \u2013 and spent ample resources and time to ensure that the dam didn\u2019t break. Soon after the deal was announced in July, Pelosi announced her backing and worked furiously with the White House to keep Democrats in line. Through August, aides said, Pelosi was on the phone during trips across the country, including in Napa Valley, California, and New Orleans at an event recognizing the 10-year anniversary of Hurricane Katrina, speaking to every member of her caucus \u2013 including some repeatedly. Trump, Cruz and Palin slam Iran nuclear deal Democrats still raised major concerns \u2013 namely over how Iranian nuclear sites could be inspected, how other countries would react if the U.S. walked away from the deal and whether rolling back sanctions against Iran would empower the country and threaten Israel. When questions were raised, relevant Cabinet members would try to iron out those concerns. And when the pressure from the President was needed, he would intensify his lobbying. Pelosi said Thursday that Obama knew the agreement so well he could teach a \u201cmasters class\u201d on the topic. She relied heavily on the President and his team to deliver the key votes. Soon after the deal was announced, Biden traveled to the House Democratic Caucus to lobby his party behind it, followed by visits from Moniz and Kerry. Then the White House focused heavily on small groups, dispatching Wendy Sherman, an under secretary of state, to brief the Congressional Black Caucus in late July. Right before the August recess, with fears that angry town hall meetings in members\u2019 home states could shift the debate, Obama spent more than two hours in the White House\u2019s Blue Room with two dozen House Democrats, answering questions from skeptical members. In a meeting with 12 House Democrats in late July who were leaning against the plan, Obama convinced half of them to support it, aides said. \u201cThis agreement is not perfect,\u201d Pelosi said Thursday. \u201cBut I never have seen a perfect anything.\u201d Opinion: The danger of the Iran deal Despite losing the support of Schumer, an influential Jewish Democrat who represents a staunchly pro-Israel constituency in New York, Democrats in the Senate were not too concerned it would have a broader impact. Schumer promised not to lobby Democrats to oppose the deal \u2013 and Democratic leaders took full advantage of that. As Reid and senior White House aides were coordinating on strategy, Durbin was calling members of his caucus on his family trip to Oregon in August. \u201cWherever we are, we have to do our work \u2013 and he was on the phone with me and others the entire time,\u201d Reid said Thursday as Durbin stood next to him. Throughout the recess, a number of Democrats who supported the deal ended up meeting with fierce opponents in order to explain their line of thinking. Sen. Bill Nelson, a Florida Democrat, ended up meeting with Ron Dermer, Israel\u2019s ambassador to the United States, in Miami. He talked with officials from the powerful pro-Israel lobbying group the American Israel Public Affairs Committee, including Holocaust survivors. \u201cIt was one of the most respectful, friendly meetings,\u201d Nelson said. Some resisted the White House\u2019s help in order to show their independence from a President whom senators said often expressed how important the deal was to him personally. \u201cI never talked to the President,\u201d said Sen. Claire McCaskill, a Missouri Democrat. \u201cI got one call from (national security adviser) Susan Rice. I told them, \u2018I don\u2019t want any calls from the administration, so leave me alone.\u2019\u201d McCaskill said she eventually backed the deal after consulting with ambassadors of Asian countries over what they would do with Iranian money they were holding if the United States walked away from the agreement. \u201cSuffice it to say, I am for the agreement,\u201d she said. READ: Iran\u2019s supreme leader: There will be no such thing as Israel in 25 years Others received attention from the President, among them Peters, the Michigan Democrat, and Colorado Sen. Michael Bennet, who faces a potentially tough re-election next year. Peters, who traveled to the Middle East and discussed the nuclear deal with officials there, also co-hosted Moniz in the Detroit-era to answer questions from skeptical voters. He also spoke to Obama twice on the phone, in addition to an Oval Office meeting. \u201cI still have a lot of concerns,\u201d Peters said Wednesday, though he\u2019s backing the deal because he believes there are no better options. Privately, Reid worked to ensure that Democrats would be prepared to filibuster the deal \u2013 something that infuriated Republicans who wanted a straight-up-or-down vote so Obama would be forced to veto the resolution of disapproval. But at a private lunch Wednesday, Reid convinced his party to join in the filibuster, even as New Jersey Sen. Bob Menendez pushed back on that strategy. Menendez demonstrated that Obama couldn\u2019t win over all of his party. Like Menendez and Schumer, Maryland Sen. Ben Cardin, the ranking Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee, opposed the deal. And Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, who rarely speaks to the President, announced his opposition after he heard strong criticism at town hall meetings in his state. The evening before Manchin announced his opposition this week, the President called up the conservative Democrat to get him to flip. Manchin, at home on his boat parked at National Harbor in Maryland, wouldn\u2019t budge. \u201cHe made his pitch, and I respect that,\u201d Manchin said. \u201cI think he knew that I was in a different place.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a no-brainer for him,\u201d he continued. \u201cI said, \u2018Mr. President, I understand that.\u2019\u201d In the end, it wouldn\u2019t matter. Republicans fell two senators shy Thursday of breaking a Democratic filibuster, which kept the Iran deal from even coming up for a vote. READ: What\u2019s in the Iran nuclear deal?

            "article_content": "\"I want to eliminate the convoluted, lobbyist-created loopholes in the code,\" Bush wrote Trump, who has yet to formally unveil his tax plan, has called for similar changes in the tax code Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush wants to crack down on hedge fund managers, putting him in rare alignment with his top sparring partner on the campaign trail: Donald Trump. Bush on Wednesday unveiled his proposal to reform the tax code, a system he repeatedly describes as \u201cconvoluted\u201d and that he says is driving American companies to move overseas. \u201cTaxes should be lower, simpler, fair and clear,\u201d Bush said at an event in Garner, North Carolina. CNN Interactive: 2016 election candidates One of his major pitches for increasing revenue is cracking down on a loophole that allows hedge fund managers to pay low tax rates on income they get from managing investments. The so-called \u201ccarried interest\u201d policy allows the profits from managing funds to be taxed as if they are investment gains instead of income. \u201cI want to eliminate the convoluted, lobbyist-created loopholes in the code,\u201d Bush wrote in his tax plan that was published on his campaign website Tuesday. \u201cWe will treat all noninvestment income the same, so unless you stake capital in an investment, you won\u2019t be able to claim the capital-gains tax rate on your market gains.\u201d Jeb Bush's life It\u2019s not clear if Bush\u2019s tax plan would be revenue neutral. His targeting of hedge fund managers echoes calls made by Trump, who, although he has yet to formally unveil his tax plan, has called for similar changes in the tax code. Trump assailed hedge fund managers in an August \u201cFace the Nation\u201d interview on CBS and said the taxes on them need to be changed. \u201cThey\u2019re paying nothing and it\u2019s ridiculous. I want to save the middle class,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThe hedge fund guys didn\u2019t build this country. These are guys that shift paper around and they get lucky.\u201d Both Bush and Trump are familiar with Wall Street. Trump acknowledged in the \u201cFace the Nation\u201d interview that \u201csome of them are friends,\u201d referring to hedge fund managers, and Bush was paid millions to advise Lehman Brothers and Barclay\u2019s after leaving the Florida governor\u2019s mansion. The two candidates\u2019 calls are also in line with those of Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders, who have also assailed the tax rate for hedge fund managers. But Bush\u2019s plan might not go after hedge fund managers as much as the candidate says it will. Roberton Williams, a senior fellow at the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center, noted that because Bush is bringing the highest tax bracket down more than 11 percentage points, the jump for taxing carried interest will also shrink by the same amount. Overall, Williams said, Bush\u2019s plan appears to lower taxes much more than it raises them. \u201cIt\u2019s not as big a tax increase on folks getting carried interest as it would be under today\u2019s ordinary tax rates,\u201d he said. Tax policy aside, Bush still took shots at Trump as he unveiled his policy in his speech, dinging Trump\u2019s infamous call for a wall with Mexico and his protectionist trade proposals. \u201cThose on the left, and even some people who call themselves Republicans these days, will tell you that to save American jobs, we have to throw up a bunch of walls and tariffs,\u201d Bush said. \u201cThat\u2019s a siren call of surrender, and I won\u2019t go for it, and I hope you won\u2019t either.\u201d He added: \u201cProtectionism has never worked \u2026 it kills jobs.\u201d Bush has not signed the pledge of anti-tax crusader Grover Norquist\u2019s group, Americans for Tax Reform, which calls on candidates to promise not to raise taxes. When asked why he hasn\u2019t signed the pledge, Bush has repeatedly referred to his history of cutting taxes as Florida\u2019s governor. On Wednesday, Norquist\u2019s group published an initial analysis of Bush\u2019s proposal, putting the carried interest policy as the only bullet point under \u201cthe bad\u201d aspects of the plan. RELATED: Christie signs tax pledge, dings Bush In a Wall Street Journal op-ed released Tuesday night, Bush also called for lowering the corporate tax rate to 20% and reducing the number of individual tax brackets to three, leaving about 15 million Americans exempt from any income-tax liability. Details from his plan were published on the eve of the Garner speech, marking his next step in a series of policy addresses that have already focused on foreign policy and government reform. The tax pitch comes as Bush attempts to steal back some of the spotlight from the GOP front-runner Trump, focusing on his record of cutting taxes while pointing out that Trump wants to raise rates on the wealthy. In his op-ed, Bush blasted the tax code as \u201ca labyrinth littered with thousands of special-interest giveaways, subsidies and other breaks written to favor Washington insiders.\u201d It advances what he called President Barack Obama\u2019s agenda of \u201clow growth, crony capitalism and easy debt,\u201d he wrote. Bush proposes reducing individual rates to three brackets down from seven \u2013 28%, 25% and 10% \u2013 and he would lower the corporate tax rate to 20%, down from 35%. His plan also eliminates \u201cthe marriage penalty, expands the Earned Income Tax Credit, ends the death tax, retires the Alternative Minimum Tax and ends the employee\u2019s share of the Social Security tax on earnings for workers older than 67,\u201d he wrote. Businesses would be allowed to deduct new capital investment. To help bring businesses back from other countries, he wants to place a one-time tax of 8.75% on the more than $2 trillion in corporate profits sitting overseas. The amount would be payable over 10 years. A campaign official confirmed that Bush met Tuesday with three high-profile conservatives who favor large tax cuts \u2013 economist Stephen Moore with the Heritage Foundation, publishing executive Steve Forbes and CNBC\u2019s Larry Kudlow. The Washington Post first reported the meeting. Last week, Bush previewed the general themes of his tax proposal while campaigning in New Hampshire. \u201cThe tax code is rife with \u2013 well-intended perhaps \u2013 but ideas that stifle the ability of people to invest in their own dreams,\u201d he said, advocating for a plan that lowers \u201ctax rates as low as possible \u2013 personal and corporate taxes \u2013 and eliminate(s) the deductions as much as possible.\u201d Bush\u2019s tax proposal is another chance to draw a contrast with Trump, who also wants to lower corporate taxes but favors raising taxes on the wealthy. Bush, for example, frequently points out that he cut taxes by $19 billion while serving as governor of Florida. Critics, however, like to highlight that the $19 billion figure was in part owed to the federal repeal of the estate tax. \u201cDonald Trump has proposed, in his most recent past, the highest tax increase in American history,\u201d he said Thursday at a town hall in Laconia, New Hampshire.",

            "article_content": "Though there were plenty of solid Clinton supporters at the Ohio rally, it was strikingly easy to find Democrats who were skeptical of her. In addition to Bernie Sanders, some Democrats said they were keeping an eye out for Vice President Joe Biden. Voters at Hillary Clinton\u2019s first rally in Ohio as a declared presidential candidate were far from committed to the Democratic front-runner Thursday, expressing apprehension as they waited for her to speak. Asked to sign pamphlets that committed them to Clinton as they walked into the event at Case Western Reserve University, voters said their hesitance stemmed from a mix of issues, including trustworthiness, the prospect of Vice President Joe Biden getting into the race and the fact that other Democrats, primarily Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, are running. \u201cI love her and admire her as a strong woman,\u201d said Jane Underwood, an undecided Ohio Democrat who voted for Obama in 2008 and 2012. \u201cBut I don\u2019t trust her. I am sad that I can\u2019t [endorse her] but I don\u2019t [trust her].\u201d Underwood, who came to the event to see what Clinton had to say, added, \u201cI\u2019d like to have a woman. That is what makes me sad. \u2026 I wish that I was able to endorse her in a more strong way. But I can\u2019t.\u201d That sentiment was not unique. Mythili Ramakrishna, a dentist from Cleveland who attended the event with her husband, said that she came to the event undecided and left the same way. In particular, Ramakrishna said she has been concerned with Clinton\u2019s lack of specificity. \u201cShe talks about raising minimum wage, but I\u2019d love for her to say a number,\u201d said Ramakrishna. Clinton has backed raising the minimum wage to $10.10 and said she is interested in a proposal that would rise it to $12, but the candidate has specifically not backed a $15 minimum wage plan that other Democrats have supported. \u201cThere is a lot of overview kind of statements that are being made, nothing specific, so that concerns me,\u201d Ramakrishna said. Though there were plenty of solid Clinton supporters at the Ohio rally \u2013 2,800 people in total came to see the former secretary of state, according to the university \u2013 it was strikingly easy to find Democrats who were skeptical. Hillary Clinton's career in the spotlight Ohio has always been a stronghold for the Clinton family. Former President Bill Clinton won the state in 1992 and 1996, and Hillary Clinton convincingly won the state\u2019s primary in 2008. On Thursday, Clinton said she would never forget what \u201cOhio did for me in 2008.\u201d \u201cYou lifted me up when I was down and out,\u201d she said, referring to the state helping get her struggling campaign back on its feet temporarily. Ohio looks like it is still fertile Clinton territory. A Quinnipiac poll released earlier this month showed Clinton had a sizable 30-point lead over Sanders. But the state\u2019s primary is months away, and if the voters at Thursday\u2019s Clinton rally are any indication, the candidate will have to work to solidify her support in the Buckeye state. \u201cIf she ends up with the Democratic nomination, I don\u2019t think I would hesitate to vote for her,\u201d said Anna Hirsch, a student from the Cleveland university. \u201cBut in terms of the primary itself, currently I am leaning towards Bernie Sanders.\u201d She added, \u201cI guess I like that he seems very much to be in touch with what the American people need. \u2026 I think he stands for a lot and he has always been very clear about what his expectations are and what he plans to do.\u201d In addition to Sanders, some Democrats said they were keeping an eye out for Biden, the sitting vice president who has been exploring a run behind the scenes. RELATED: Donald Trump trounces GOP field, Biden leads general election match-ups \u201cI think there is room in the race for another strong candidate and I think I would like to hear his voice,\u201d said Bernie Jim from South Euclid, Ohio. \u201cI don\u2019t know if it would shake me from being a Hillary supporter but I could see him in the race.\u201d Eva Katsaros, another student at Case Western, said she was \u201cdefinitely\u201d looking at Biden, primarily because his views \u201cmore align with what I think.\u201d Not all attendees had eyes on Biden. Phyllis Leder, a 67-year-old Ohio voter, said she was feels like Clinton resonates with women and middle class voters like herself.

            "article_content": "Hillary Clinton's flagging poll numbers raise the specter of whether Elizabeth Warren might still enter the 2016 contest. All the energy in the Democratic Party is on the left, and Warren has exerted an ideological pull that is helping to shape the race So much for Elizabeth Warren taking a pass on 2016. The scourge of Wall Street might have disappointed her legions of \u201cRun Warren Run\u201d supporters by ruling out her own bid for the White House earlier this year. But the Massachusetts senator is in the thick of the Democratic race anyway. Warren offered a fresh glimpse of her political star power and talismanic value for Democrats when she held a furtive meeting with Vice President Joe Biden on Saturday \u2013 which briefly knocked even Donald Trump out of the headlines. The encounter, first reported by CNN, intensified speculation that Biden, perhaps encouraged by front-runner Hillary Clinton\u2019s ebbing poll numbers, is moving closer to a White House run and is keen to connect with Warren\u2019s fervent supporters. Who's running for President? It also returned her name to the political mix, as Biden\u2019s interest in powwowing with her as he mulls a presidential run demonstrates her clout, and those same flagging poll numbers raise the specter of whether Warren missed her moment \u2013 or might still plan to seize it and enter the 2016 race herself. \u201cElizabeth Warren does have a thumb on the pulse of the progressive movement, the space that Bernie Sanders is occupying,\u201d said former South Carolina state lawmaker and CNN contributor Bakari Sellers on Sunday, referring to the Vermont senator challenging Clinton from the left. The shifting dynamics of the Democratic race, reshaped by Clinton\u2019s rough start to an expected coronation now haunted by a controversy over her private email server, could yet offer new opportunities and leverage for Warren. She insists, however, that she\u2019s not having second thoughts about her own decision to forgo a presidential run. \u201cNo,\u201d \u201cno\u201d and \u201cnope,\u201d Warren said unequivocally in a string of recent interviews with media organizations in her home state when asked whether she now feels she should have thrown her hat in the ring for president. CNN Interactive: 2016 election candidates In many ways, the Democratic race for president is unfolding in Warren\u2019s ideological image anyway. \u201cPeople want to hear about the issues, they want to hear about change, they want to hear about how we take a system that is rigged and unrig it,\u201d Warren said in a weekend interview on WBZ-TV in Boston. After Biden\u2019s meeting with Warren, his aides said the topic was mostly \u201ceconomic issues\u201d and not the election. But since Warren\u2019s push for raising taxes to create jobs, for clean energy, for affordable education, for infrastructure spending and against free trade deals undergirds the Democratic race, the conversation could hardly have been more political. And the meeting was testimony to the power of Warren herself. Is Biden leaning toward 2016 run? READ: First on CNN: Biden meets with Warren in Washington The fact that the sitting vice president would travel to Washington from Delaware just to meet her on a Saturday was a sign that Warren\u2019s weight in the Democratic Party outstrips her status as a first-term senator \u2013 a lowly spot in a chamber where seniority rules. Warren had already held a private meeting with Clinton late last year, which taken with the Biden talks offer proof that her standing has not eroded despite snubbing entreaties by her left-wing base to mount a presidential run herself. Indeed, all the energy in the Democratic Party now is on the left, and she has exerted an ideological pull that is helping to shape the nominating showdown along the lines of a script she wrote herself on issues like banking regulation and student debt. Warren\u2019s eventual endorsement could prove an important moment in motivating base voters to support the eventual nominee. Warren emerged from the Great Recession as a major political player, and conceived of and ran President Barack Obama\u2019s Consumer Protection Agency before running for the Senate. She is such a heroine to those on the progressive left of the Democratic Party that it\u2019s known among many activists as the \u201cWarren Wing.\u201d \u201cWe have seen a race to the top on Elizabeth Warren\u2019s ideas, including debt-free college, expanding Social Security, and holding Wall Street banks accountable,\u201d said Stephanie Taylor, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee. \u201cThat dynamic would continue if Vice President Biden chooses to enter the race.\u201d But Clinton and Biden, if he runs, would be seen as centrist Democrats associated with an administration with which Warren has sometimes clashed, and would need to make peace with the progressive left. Many of the grass-roots Democratic activists who once hoped to fight for Warren have now gravitated to Sanders, a Vermont senator who has described himself as a socialist, injecting momentum into a populist, progressive campaign that has shown a surprising capacity to attract massive crowds and come within spitting distance of Clinton in some polls, given that he started the race in the single digits. Sanders on Monday responded to Warren\u2019s meeting with Biden by calling her a \u201cvery good friend\u201d whom he\u2019d met many times. He then fired off the kind of acidic critique of the U.S. economic system for which she has become known. \u201cI think people understand there is something profoundly wrong today with establishment politics, that we need some bold ideas to resurrect the middle class in this country, to address poverty, to address income and wealth inequality,\u201d Sanders told reporters in New Hampshire. Such is Warren\u2019s importance in the party that her every utterance is pored over by political strategists for evidence of veiled criticism of Clinton \u2013 who faces a tough job in winning over progressives wary of the former secretary of state\u2019s ties to Wall Street donors who have helped underwrite her family\u2019s many campaigns and philanthropic foundation. Disappointment in Clinton still lingers over her Senate vote in 2002 to authorize war in Iraq and what some see as hawkish national security instincts. Bernie Sanders' political career READ: Bernie Sanders beats Hillary Clinton in latest New Hampshire poll In her campaign so far, Clinton has tacked to her left \u2013 and toward Warren\u2019s positions on financial regulation and government programs aimed at making college debt-free. She has also criticized the Obama administration\u2019s plan to open certain areas of the Arctic to exploratory oil and gas drilling. As part of an apparent bid to court Warren supporters, Clinton wrote a glowing tribute to the Massachusetts senator in Time magazine earlier this year. \u201cElizabeth Warren never lets us forget that the work of taming Wall Street\u2019s irresponsible risk-taking and reforming our financial system is far from finished,\u201d Clinton wrote. \u201cAnd she never hesitates to hold powerful people\u2019s feet to the fire: bankers, lobbyists, senior government officials and, yes, even presidential aspirants.\u201d But Warren is indicating that for now, no one has sewn up her support. \u201cI don\u2019t think anybody\u2019s anointed,\u201d Warren said, when asked on WBZ-TV if Clinton was already the de-facto nominee in an interview that aired on Sunday and caused stirs across the political world. But while she looks set to wield great influence in the Democratic race, and could eventually help whoever becomes the nominee, disappointment still lingers for many Warren supporters who had hoped she would run for president in her own right. While Warren has never explained exactly why she decided against a run, there are many possible reasons. Her lack of national security experience may have been a factor; she may have been wary of provoking the Clinton machine; she may have accepted a feeling among Democrats that it was Clinton\u2019s turn to finally make history as the Democratic Party\u2019s first female nominee. Most polls earlier this year also suggested she would struggle to beat Clinton in a head-to-head race, given the former first lady\u2019s likely strength among Hispanic voters and minorities and the size of her political infrastructure. Warren may have looked at the prospects and calculated that a failed presidential run could have undercut her influence. Her political behavior since then and her decision so far not to play her top political card \u2013 her endorsement \u2013 may prove to be a shrewd move. Not only is she preserving her capacity to influence candidates in the current campaign, she also appears to be seeking to cement an influence in the party that endures long past the 2016 election. \u201cShe\u2019s a very important figure,\u201d said Jim Manley, a former senior aide to then-Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid. \u201cHer modus operandi has been to hang back and let the process play out. She is playing the long game,\u201d he said. \u201cI am not sure what the future holds for her, but I think she is determined to carve out a role within the party for many years to come.\u201d",

            "article_content": "McCaskill, a Democrat said Biden is a \"sweet, nice guy\" but it might be unwise for the vice president to take on Clinton She also criticized other Republican candidates for failing to take on Trump more directly over his recent comments about women Missouri Sen. Claire McCaskill said Wednesday the surge in popularity for both Republican Donald Trump and Democratic socialist Bernie Sanders can be attributed to popular \u201ccynicism\u201d about Washington. \u201cPeople are really aggravated at the government right now,\u201d McCaskill, a Hillary Clinton supporter, told CNN\u2019s \u201cNew Day\u201d on Wednesday. \u201cThere are a lot of people that are just going \u2018Really? You guy\u2019s can\u2019t get anything done? All you do is fight.\u2019\u201d McCaskill said that Trump and Sanders also come at the problem of unhinged political donations from different angles, too. Trump is wealthy and doesn\u2019t need any donations and Sanders eschews the money almost completely. Combined, they nail popular sentiments about Washington and politicians. \u201cI think there is a huge amount of cynicism and frustration with the government writ large,\u201d McCaskill said. McCaskill is backing Clinton just as Sanders is rising in the polls in New Hampshire and questions about Clinton\u2019s use of a personal email server persist. The former secretary of state promised to turn over the entire server to federal investigators Tuesday night. McCaskill said Tuesday that Vice President Joe Biden, who is mulling a run, might be damaged by taking on Clinton and questioned whether Sanders could win a general election. She also said Donald Trump would be the easiest Republican for Clinton to topple \u2013 largely because he\u2019d be likely to \u201cpop off and say something outrageous on the world stage.\u201d McCaskill, who supported Barack Obama in the 2008 Democratic primary, said Tuesday in an interview with Yahoo News that Biden is a \u201csweet, nice guy\u201d but \u2013 in part because of her protective instincts for him \u2013 it might be unwise for the vice president to take on Clinton. \u201cI\u2019m worried if he does and doesn\u2019t do well, it will be hurtful to him, and we all care about him deeply,\u201d McCaskill said. One of Clinton\u2019s biggest Senate Democratic supporters headed into the 2016 presidential race, McCaskill said Tuesday that Sanders would have a harder time winning a general election. \u201cI think the question that some of us have is can someone who has said, \u2018I\u2019m not a Democrat,\u2019 has chosen the title of socialist, is that person really electable?\u201d she said. \u201cI think there is a large group of people who feel that the party needs to be more liberal, that the party needs to be further to the left, and a lot of them are young people. They are looking for someone who is really going to stick it to all the big guys,\u201d McCaskill said. \u201cAnd so I think that is a reality right now. And I respect that. I\u2019m glad he\u2019s out there talking about those issues, and I think in the long run it\u2019s going to be helpful to Hillary Clinton\u2019s candidacy, not harmful.\u201d Who's running for President? McCaskill predicted that Clinton would have the easiest time defeating Trump of all the GOP candidates. \u201cDonald Trump may be a lot of things, but I don\u2019t think he\u2019s a steady hand,\u201d McCaskill, a Missouri Democrat, said Tuesday in an interview with CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper on \u201cThe Lead\u201d when asked which Republican she thinks Clinton would celebrate facing. McCaskill criticized other Republican candidates for failing to take on Trump more directly over his comments about women during last week\u2019s first GOP presidential debate \u2013 which was followed by Trump attacking Fox News host Megyn Kelly on social media and in television interviews for her questions, suggesting at one point that she had \u201cblood coming out of her eyes; blood coming out of her wherever.\u201d \u201cThey were all so anxious to tip-toe around Donald Trump, they were not willing to state the obvious, and I think women know it,\u201d McCaskill said. She offered praise for Carly Fiorina, the former Hewlett-Packard executive and the only female GOP presidential contender. \u201cI think she\u2019s very strong and smart and accomplished, although I happen to disagree with her on almost everything. I want her to get her due, I want her to be acknowledged for the strength that she possesses,\u201d McCaskill said. But, she added: \u201cBut I think that her views are not going to really signal to the middle class in America that she\u2019s their candidate.\u201d",

            "article_content": "The first debate of the 2016 cycle is finally over. But how did it play? As Republicans gathered to duke it out in Cleveland, CNN assembled a focus group of undecided Iowa Republican voters in Pella, a small town east of Des Moines, moderated by CNN\u2019s Joe Johns. In recent caucuses, Pella has voted similarly to Iowa as a whole. Rick Santorum came in first in 2012, and Mike Huckabee won in 2008. Pella has historically voted overwhelmingly Republican in the general election. In the crucial first-in-the-nation caucus state that can make or break a candidate\u2019s chance for the nomination, Iowans pride themselves on winnowing the field. And in a particularly crowded field of 2016 candidates, they take the responsibility very seriously. Thursday evening\u2019s biggest loser in Pella was frontrunner Donald Trump. Ahead of the debate, all participants said they were open-minded toward the businessman. That quickly changed after the first question. Participants overwhelmingly agreed that Trump\u2019s willingness to run as a third party candidate was a turnoff. \u201cThe more he talks, the less I like him,\u201d said Karen Converse, 53, a realtor from nearby Oskaloosa.  \u201cHe\u2019s making the other candidates look better, he\u2019s making them look credible.\u201d College student Lindsey Mueller, 21, was unsettled by Trump\u2019s record on women. \u201cIf you call somebody a pig and tell them they\u2019ll look better on their knees, that\u2019s not political correctness \u2026 ,\u201d Mueller said. \u201cMy concern is ethics, said Steve Heerema, 45, a minister. \u201cI don\u2019t like Donald Trump because I don\u2019t think he has ethics.\u201d For engineer Jacob Limke, 26, Trump showed that he would not work well with others. \u201cHe\u2019s always been the boss \u2026 If he didn\u2019t get his way, what would he do? It makes me nervous to think about that, how many executive orders he would sign,\u201d Limke said. \u201cHis business record makes me uneasy and uncertain about what is he going to do.\u201d By the end of the debate, none said they would give him a second look, describing the businessman as a \u201cbully,\u201d \u201cnot ready for the big leagues,\u201d \u201ca talking parrot,\u201d and \u201cabrasive.\u201d CNN fact checks the Republican debates Who had the best breakout performance? In Pella, Ben Carson stood out, described as \u201cready for prime time,\u201d \u201cbrilliant,\u201d and \u201csomeone you can really trust.\u201d \u201cEverything about him is impressive,\u201d said Lynne Henry. \u201cI just get a real sense of peace and calm with this man that I have not felt from a candidate since Ronald Reagan.\u201d By the end of the night, Henry, who went into the debate interested in both Trump and Carson, was ready to make a decision: \u201cI have been holding onto a Ben Carson bumper sticker that got sent to me, I\u2019ve been waiting to put it on my car. It\u2019s going on tonight.\u201d Florida Sen. Marco Rubio and Ohio Gov. John Kasich both impressed participants, as well. Rubio\u2019s middle class upbringing resonated with the group, and despite concerns about his lack of governing experience, participants found the senator well-informed and trustworthy. Kasich\u2019s response to a question on same-sex marriage resonated positively with the group. Though all agreed that Jeb Bush gave no wrong answers, he failed to ignite enthusiasm in the Pella group. \u201cI have no problems with Jeb Bush, I\u2019m just not that excited about him right now,\u201d Heerema said. \u201cIt\u2019s not like I disagree with him, it\u2019s not like I don\u2019t agree with a lot of what he says,\u201d said Julie Mueller, a small-business owner and wife of the Pella mayor. \u201cHe has a very good record in Florida, but I\u2019m suffering from a little bit of Bush fatigue and he\u2019s just not that interesting \u2026 I think it\u2019s the last name, and maybe that\u2019s too bad.\u201d In an informal show of hands, seven participants said they would vote for Ben Carson if the caucus were held today, three for Marco Rubio and one for Kasich. Iowa\u2019s caucus night is scheduled for February. 8 takeaways from the debate",

            "article_content": "Longtime Democratic operative Katie McGinty officially declared her entry into the primary Tuesday, Democrats see the Pennsylvania seat as one of their prime pickup opportunities in the Senate in 2016 The Pennsylvania Senate primary got a little more crowded on the Democratic side Tuesday, but the national party continues to hold off on anointing a candidate. Democrats see a challenge to incumbent Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pennsylvania, as one of their prime pickup opportunities in the Senate in 2016 but have struggled to coalesce behind a challenger. Longtime Democratic operative Katie McGinty officially declared her entry into the primary Tuesday, as expected, releasing a three-minute campaign video highlighting her work as chief of staff to Gov. Tom Wolf and Pennsylvania-native family biography. But minutes after her official announcement went out to the media, the communications director for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee tweeted that the party has not picked a horse. \u201cWe\u2019re excited about the candidates we have in PA and look forward to running a strong campaign that turns Pennsylvania blue in 2016. #pasen,\u201d Justin Barasky wrote. McGinty joins former Rep. Joe Sestak, D-Pennsylvania, in the primary. Sestak declared his candidacy in March, but the party has held off from throwing its full support behind him. Sestak drew Democrats\u2019 ire when he primaried former Pennsylvania Democratic Sen. Arlen Specter in 2010, defeating the party-switching incumbent only to lose to Toomey in the general election. Allentown Mayor Ed Pawlowski suspended his campaign last month amid a federal probe into his city\u2019s contracting. McGinty has a long history in national and state Democratic politics. She joined Wolf\u2019s administration after losing to him in the gubernatorial primary, and previously worked in the Clinton administration and Gov. Ed Rendell\u2019s administration on environmental issues. She\u2019s been expected to join the race for weeks, and resigned from the governor\u2019s office to clear her path late last month. Sestak has struggled in the polls against Toomey. The most recent Quinnipiac poll in June had him trailing 47% to 36%. McGinty wasn\u2019t polled, though Wolf had positive approval ratings in the survey. In her announcement video, McGinty ran through a list of national and state Democratic priorities, including affordable health care, job training, raising the minimum wage, equal pay for women, clean energy, unfair trade practices and college affordability. \u201cWe need partners in Washington to help solve problems, not make them worse,\u201d McGinty said. \u201cUnfortunately, Sen. Pat Toomey has become part of that Washington mess and has left middle class families out and behind.\u201d The National Republican Senatorial Committee was also quick to jump on the announcement, slamming McGinty\u2019s record and entrance into the race. \u201cPennsylvania Democrats are so dissatisfied with Congressman Joe Sestak\u2019s candidacy that they are now placing their bets on someone who finished dead last in a four-way Democratic gubernatorial primary last year,\u201d NRSC spokeswoman Andrea Bozek said in a statement. \u201cIt\u2019s bad enough that McGinty is one of the main proponents of the largest tax hike in Pennsylvania history, but her decision to pursue her own political ambitions instead of continuing to work to solve Pennsylvania\u2019s budget problems is proof positive she values her own self interest above that of Pennsylvania\u2019s interests.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Billionaire political donor Charles Koch, who has spent millions of dollars to influence elections, slammed \u201ccorporate welfare\u201d and \u201ccronyism\u201d in an interview published Monday. Speaking at the resort where he and his brother David Koch summoned their network of wealthy donors which plans to spend $889 million on the 2016 election, Charles Koch said politicians ultimately serve \u201ctheir supporters\u201d when they get into office, a practice he slammed as \u201cdestructive.\u201d \u201cI like a lot of the Republican rhetoric better than the Democrats\u2019. But when they\u2019re in office, it\u2019s pretty much the same thing. It\u2019s serving their supporters, it\u2019s corporate welfare, it\u2019s cronyism which is so destructive, particularly to the disadvantaged,\u201d Koch told the Washington Post. Koch insisted he would \u201cget rid of all the corporate welfare\u201d and said \u201cwe fight against all of it.\u201d RELATED: Could Koch brothers take out Donald Trump? The intensely private megadonor\u2019s decision to sit for an interview came as the Koch brothers and their network of donors let reporters inside the private summit for the first time as an effort to shed the image that Democrats have painted of them as a nefarious pair of brothers and their political network. Five Republican presidential candidates made an appearance at the Koch brothers\u2019 biannual political summit, looking to lock in some support of the Kochs\u2019 vast and deep-pocketed political network. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz and former Hewlett-Packard chief executive Carly Fiorina all attended the summit, courting the megadonors\u2019 highly-valued support. The Koch brothers have yet to settle on a favorite in the primary race, a point Charles Koch underscored again in his interview Monday. Koch emphasized though that the country needs to change trajectory, pointing to losses in productivity and slower growth of the middle class and, at two points in the interview, said that the damage is bad \u201cparticularly for the disadvantaged.\u201d He also downplayed the influence and power that he and his brother hold over American politics, saying \u201cpeople like to overstate the case.\u201d \u201cThere are so many things I would change!\u201d Koch said. \u201cIf I had all this power, why aren\u2019t they getting changed? This is ludicrous.\u201d And as the Republicans vying for the Kochs\u2019 support continue to downplay the existence of global warming or its effects, despite overwhelming scientific evidence and agreement, Koch himself explained that he doesn\u2019t believe global warming will have the \u201ccatastrophic\u201d effects that some are foreboding. \u201cWell, I mean I believe it\u2019s been warming some,\u201d said Koch, an oil and chemical magnate. \u201cthere has been warming. The CO2 goes up, the CO2 has probably contributed to that. But they say it\u2019s going to be catastrophic. There is no evidence to that.\u201d Koch, who believes in a free-market system with minimal government influence, also weighed in on what he said he believes are unnecessary and burdensome licensing practices. \u201cBartender: he\u2019s going to make your drink too strong? I mean, this is nonsense!\u201d Koch said.",

            "article_content": "It was just another frenzied Friday in Clinton World. Two apparent blockbuster revelations emerged in the email controversy hounding Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 campaign. But on later inspection, they seemed to be much less damning than they first appeared. The campaign\u2019s tortured relations with the press meanwhile took another disastrous turn with spokesman Nick Merrill lashing reporters for using \u201creckless, inaccurate leaks from partisan sources.\u201d And through it all, the candidate herself sailed into a room at New York University, in her customary spot in the eye of the political storm \u2013 apparently unperturbed and ready to reel off a wonk-heavy speech on tax and the economy. \u201cMaybe the heat is getting to everybody,\u201d Clinton said, with more than a trace of contempt for the hysteria erupting around her at an unwelcome time as polls suggest her trustworthiness is taking a fresh battering. READ: Official: Clinton emails included classified information By the end of the day, the Clinton campaign appeared to have capitalized on media missteps to limit immediate new damage to her presidential hopes. But the dizzying catalog of revelations and campaign counter attacks was another sign that the festering fight over the private email server she used while running U.S. diplomacy will confound her presidential quest for months to come. It all started late on Thursday night with an apparent New York Times bombshell. The paper reported that independent inspectors general had asked the Justice Department for a criminal probe of Clinton\u2019s email use while secretary of state. The Clinton campaign hit back hard, quickly getting the Times to soften the lead of its story to make clear the requested probe was not of Clinton herself, but into whether emails connected to her were mishandled. The distinction was important because the latter formulation of any eventual Justice Department inquiry could conceivably give Clinton personal distance from any wrongdoing. Throughout Friday morning, Clinton\u2019s press aides pushed back on the report, shipping reporters a tweet by former Nevada political pundit Jon Ralston that the Times failure to correct its story was \u201cjust so, so dumb.\u201d When the Times did decide to correct its story later Friday, it offered some critical vindication to Clinton, at least for the time being. \u201cHere we are yet again correcting a story,\u201d Clinton\u2019s senior spokeswoman Karen Finney said on CNN. Clinton got in her own dig Friday afternoon just before her speech on middle class economics but did not take questions from reporters. She complained about \u201ca lot of inaccuracies\u201d in reporting on the emails and said she had repeatedly offered to testify before a congressional committee on the private server she used as secretary of state. As Washington digested the showdown with the Times, a rival paper, the Wall Street Journal, busted out its own email expose. The paper said that Clinton, despite her denials, had indeed emailed some classified information from her private account while secretary of state \u2013 a possibility that could land Clinton in legal as well as political jeopardy. But again, the revelation turned out to be less immediately damaging than it had first seemed. In a letter to Congress, the inspector general for the intelligence community, Charles McCullough, said that some material Clinton sent from her server was indeed classified \u2013 but was not identified as such. READ: New York Times issues correction on Clinton email story Because it was not identified, it is unclear whether Clinton realized she was potentially compromising classified information \u2013 again offering her a possible defense. That opened the way for Finney to portray the whole affair as just a turf war between intelligence and State Department officials about what information should be kept secret. The Justice Department, meanwhile, clarified that it was considering a probe of Clinton\u2019s email practices, but not a \u201ccriminal\u201d probe. As is so often the case in the myriad scandals, controversies and pseudo-scandals that have swirled around the Clintons for decades, the disclosures left the situation murkier than it had been before and clouded in a flurry of complicated details likely to confuse the average voter. And while there did not appear to be sufficient material to seriously damage or even doom Clinton\u2019s political career, there was just enough confusion to offer fresh ammunition for her enemies. The Clinton email episode also mirrors the 1990s Clinton scandals in the hyper partisan emotions it stirs \u2013 and the way it never really seems to go away, but also never reaches a climax. The latest cycle of allegations and counter attacks from the Clinton campaign comes when there is an increasing focus on how the former secretary of state\u2019s character could complicate her presidential efforts. Three new opinion polls in swing states Iowa, Colorado and Virginia this week showed that Clinton was trailing several leading Republican candidates including Jeb Bush, Marco Rubio and Scott Walker in a hypothetical match-up for the White House. While the general election is 16 months away, the polls pointed to a possible personal vulnerability for Clinton as majorities of voters in all three states said she was not honest and trustworthy. And the media fixation on such episodes claimed another victim \u2013 any coverage Clinton could have expected for her big speech \u2013 an economic argument she is putting at the center of her campaign. While most of her potential Republican rivals were content to let Clinton stew in the spotlight, the Republican National Committee used the latest spate of scandal fever to jab the Democratic front runner. Clinton has struggled for decades to shake off political attacks painting her as secretive, obstructive and dishonest \u2013 and the email saga and rows over the source of foreign donations to her family\u2019s philanthropic organization have ensured a similar theme undercuts her 2016 presidential campaign. RNC chair Reince Priebus said that Clinton\u2019s \u201cdesire to play by her own rules\u201d may have exposed classified information \u2013 adding \u201ca full investigation by the Justice Department is not just needed, but required.\u201d Republican political consultant Katie Packer previewed the way Republican candidates are likely to exploit Friday\u2019s drama as Clinton\u2019s email problem lingers. \u201cIn terms of the way the American people view her, they already have questions about whether she can be trusted. She has shown a propensity to lie when things get uncomfortable,\u201d Gage said.",

            "article_content": "Most presidential candidates are filing their first campaign finance reports Wednesday Jeb Bush leads the pack at $114.4 million What\u2019s there to make of all this money? Most presidential candidates are filing their first campaign finance reports Wednesday, but many hopefuls have taken the past two weeks to highlight their impressive hauls \u2013 or alternatively, slide smaller sums in the middle of detailed memos or release them late on Friday afternoons. Some candidates have had much longer to raise money for their accounts than others, and some chose to raise money purely for their primary while others began to raise money for a general election. The total amount of \u201chard dollars\u201d \u2013 the money directly controlled by the campaign \u2013 speaks to how much each campaign has to hire staff, organize in the early-voting states and send their candidate around the country. RELATED: Bush raises over $100 million to help his campaign But equally important are \u201csoft dollars\u201d \u2013 money given to outside groups that are allied with particular campaigns. Nearly every presidential hopeful has a super PAC, which can raise money in unlimited amounts as long as it doesn\u2019t coordinate how that cash is spent with the campaign it is supporting. And some aspirants also have nonprofit groups behind them. Those organizations also can raise unlimited money, but are able to hide its donors\u2019 names in return for not spending its entire budget on express advocacy for a particular candidate. Given the contribution limits, these outside groups are dwarfing the official campaigns in the total size of fundraising. Yet as any fundraiser or political strategist will tell you, that downplays the power of an official campaign: Because they control the money in their bank account, the campaign can deploy its resources where it sees fit rather than merely hoping their super PAC makes the right call. And super PACs historically have spent much of their budget purchasing television, which is sold to campaigns at a much lower rate than it is to the outside groups. Sanders hits Bush on fundraising We\u2019ll know all candidates\u2019 totals Wednesday and the totals of all super PACs by the end of the month when the spenders file with the Federal Elections Commission. Often, the details of the report \u2013 which vendors have been hired, who is each candidate\u2019s biggest donor, and how much cash each organization has on hand \u2013 can be just as telling about the campaign\u2019s path to victory as the official tally. RELATED: Sanders takes shot at Bush\u2019s war chest But here\u2019s what each candidate and their backers now claim, ranked by the size of their hauls thus far. Jeb Bush: $114.4 million Campaign: $11.4 million Super PAC: $103 million Bush delayed launching his own campaign in order to fundraise directly for his super PAC, which some charge allowed him to skirt around campaign-finance laws but nevertheless allowed him to enter the presidential race with a record-shattering sum to back him. Hillary Clinton: $60.6 million Campaign: $45 million Super PAC: $15.6 million Clinton is also supported by the opposition research firm American Bridge, which has strong ties to her campaign but is technically not a pro-Clinton group. It has two spending vehicles that raised an additional $8.7 million. Ted Cruz: $52.2 million Campaign: $14.2 million Super PACs: $38 million Cruz has had two quarters to raise his $14 million \u2013 he filed a first-quarter fundraising report with just over $4 million raised in April \u2013 but has turned heads with the surprisingly strong performance of his super PACs. Marco Rubio: $43.9 million Campaign: $12 million Super PAC: $16.1 million Nonprofit: $15.8 million The Florida senator is backed up by two outside groups: a super PAC, the Conservative Solutions PAC, and a nonprofit, the Conservative Solutions Project. Rick Perry: $17.9 million Campaign: $1.1 million Super PAC: $16.8 million Perry\u2019s weak fundraising haul was tucked in last week mere minutes after his super PAC announced an impressive total that came almost entirely from three big donors. Bernie Sanders: $15 million Campaign: $15 million Jeb Bush's huge fundraising haul Sanders rails against the \u201cbillionaire class\u201d on the stump and has sworn off the help of a super PAC \u2013 though nothing can prevent his supporters from eventually starting one. John Kasich: $11.5 million 527 committee: $11.5 million Kasich does not yet have an official campaign account because he doesn\u2019t yet have a campaign (he\u2019s expected to launch next week). But his political committee, New Day for America, raised over $10.5 million in its first two months, while \u201callied organizations\u201d took in the rest. Chris Christie: $11 million Super PAC: $11 million The New Jersey governor won\u2019t file his first campaign-finance report until the fall since he announced his campaign on the last day of the second quarter. His super PAC, however, said Tuesday it had raised $11 million to support him. Ben Carson: $10.5 million Campaign: $10.5 million Carson is a favorite of small donors who give online. The two independent super PACs \u2013 which haven\u2019t yet released their totals \u2013 are reportedly feuding with one another. Mike Huckabee: $8 million Campaign: $2 million Super PAC and nonprofit: $6 million A senior adviser to the former Arkansas governor\u2019s campaign said Tuesday that the super PAC supporting him, Pursuing America\u2019s Greatness, and the nonprofit group, America Takes Action, combined to raise $6 million. Rand Paul: $7 million Campaign: $7 million Paul may have had nearly the entire quarter to raise money for his campaign, but he raised much less than some of his Republican competitors. Paul has reportedly had trouble collecting the early money that he\u2019s expected to need to succeed. He has two main super PACs \u2013 America\u2019s Liberty PAC and Concerned American Voters \u2013 that have not yet released their fundraising totals. Carly Fiorina: $4.8 million Campaign: $1.4 million Super PAC: $3.4 million Fiorina\u2019s super PAC is playing a larger role in day-to-day campaign operations than perhaps any other outside group, and the fundraising numbers reflect that. Just don\u2019t confuse the two: Despite its name, \u201cCarly For America\u201d is not the official campaign. Do you know the campaign logo? Lincoln Chafee: $390,000 Campaign: $390,000 The quixotic bid of the former Rhode Island governor is off to a slow start. He raised $390,000 to begin the race \u2013 and $360,000 of that came from a loan he made to himself. Scott Walker, Bobby Jindal, Rick Santorum, Lindsey Graham, George Pataki, Martin O\u2019Malley: Undisclosed. We don\u2019t know how much these candidates or their affiliated outside groups have yet raised. Walker, who only announced his bid Monday, has two committees that are expected to announce about $20 million. Jindal has a super PAC that has been aggressively spending in Iowa, but he\u2019s unlikely to post a substantial sum. O\u2019Malley\u2019s super PAC has hit Sanders online, but he also isn\u2019t known enough to be a financial juggernaut. Santorum, Graham and Pataki all have official campaigns and super PACs behind them as well, but it\u2019s unclear until Wednesday how at least the campaigns are doing.",

            "article_content": "Hillary Clinton singled out her GOP rivals by name during speeches Monday Her rival for the Democratic nomination, Sen. Bernie Sanders, got no such mention Hillary Clinton squarely took aim at her biggest rivals on Monday during the first policy speech of her campaign, directly calling them by name as she strives to get Democrats fired up about her candidacy. The names she uttered spoke volumes: Jeb Bush, Marco Rubio, Scott Walker. For all the talk about the need to protect her left flank, she treated the spark of Bernie Sanders like little more than a summer firefly that can be ignored or swatted away. In her second bid for the presidency, Clinton may not be inspiring the passion of the crowds turning out for Sanders. But she made clear on Monday that she believes the best way to rally Democrats to her side in the primary fight is to present herself as the toughest, most electable candidate for the general election, casting back to her husband\u2019s economy in order to project forward to her own. Hillary: 'President Clinton -- I like the sound of that' \u201cUnder President Clinton,\u201d she said, referring to him. \u201cI like the sound of that,\u201d she added, smiling at the thought of being in the White House again. The confidence of her words illustrates that she is comfortable playing the long game and has no intention of being spooked or distracted by any Democratic who are slow to jump on the bandwagon. Whether it\u2019s a risky strategy to underestimate her Democratic opponents won\u2019t be known until the winter, when she faces the voters of Iowa and New Hampshire. But for now, at least, Clinton is looking far beyond those early contests to a bigger fight. She accused Bush, the former Florida governor, of being out of touch with American workers. She sought to use his own words against him when he said last week in New Hampshire that \u201cpeople need to work longer hours.\u201d \u201cWell, he must not have met very many American workers,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cThey don\u2019t need a lecture \u2013 they need a raise.\u201d Before she even finished her speech at the New School in Manhattan, Bush had already opened a fundraising drive with her remarks. His aides said she was distorting his words, when he was simply saying there were not enough full-time job opportunities for workers. While Clinton\u2019s policy address was substantive, it was also heavily laced with familiar economic arguments that have framed the Democratic vs. Republican fight for years. She hedged her bets, clearly not sure which Republican candidate would emerge from their crowded primary fight. She blasted a tax proposal from Rubio, the Florida senator, and said it would cut taxes for families making $3 million a year. \u201cWell that\u2019s a sure budget-busting give-away to the super-wealthy,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s the kind of bad economics you\u2019re likely to get from any of the candidates on the other side.\u201d And she assailed Walker as \u201cmean-spirited\u201d and \u201cmisguided\u201d for his successful effort to curtain unions\u2019 rights in Wisconsin, rushing to the defense of Democrats\u2019 labor base \u2013 tying its decline to growing inequality, particularly among men. \u201cRepublicans\u2019 governors like Scott Walker have made their names stomping on workers\u2019 rights,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cAnd practically all the Republican candidates hope to do the same as President.\u201d The Clinton speech, which came nearly three months to the day since she declared her candidacy, offered one of the most expansive looks yet at her policy proposals. It was hardly a fiery stemwinder, but her 45-minute address laid the groundwork for themes she will turn back to again and again in her campaign as she tries to present herself as a fighter for the middle class. It also served as a benchmark for whether she can get through her primary fight without directly drawing distinctions with her Democratic rivals, namely Sanders, who has been strongly embraced by the progressive movement. Clinton was dodging the left, offering up what liberals have ached to hear from a presidential candidate without delving into details or making firm commitments, while she jabbed the right. She offered scolding words for Wall Street, saying she would criminally prosecute financial firms and individuals for any wrongdoing. The comment struck liberal groups \u2013 particularly several that had tried to recruit firebrand Sen. Elizabeth Warren into the race \u2013 because it\u2019s further than President Barack Obama\u2019s administration was willing to go in the wake of the 2008 economic downturn. Joseph Stiglitz, the Nobel Prize-winning economist who is a darling of the left and has met with Clinton to talk policy, said her speech shows she understands the need to \u201cfundamentally rewrite the rules\u201d to ensure that \u201cour financial markets work for everyday Americans rather than the short-term interests of CEOs and speculators.\u201d Clinton didn\u2019t offer the harsh attacks on corporate America that Sanders has served up for the left, but she did condemn Republicans for claiming they could achieve substantial economic growth rates without also offering policies that would direct that new income toward the middle class. \u201cToday, as the shadow of crisis recedes and longer-term challenges come into focus, I believe we have to build a growth and fairness economy,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cYou can\u2019t have one without the other.\u201d As she stood on a stage, flanked by a row of flags, Clinton sent a signal that she would rely on her experience \u2013 and that of the last two Democratic presidential administrations \u2013 but that she would also have to charter her own forward-looking course. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to find all the answers we need today in the playbooks of the past,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cToday is not 1993 or 2009. We need solutions for the big challenges we face now.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Hillary Clinton gives an economic policy address on Monday She pushed for increasing wages as well as policies like paid family and sick leave Hillary Clinton pledged to rein in out-of-control financial institutions on Monday as she detailed an economic vision that she said would achieve the \u201cdefining economic challenge of our life\u201d of lifting middle-class wages. The Democratic front-runner lambasted a marketplace she said is too obsessed with second-to-second stock trading and quarterly earnings reports, at the expense of long-term growth and stability in a speech that was heavy on politics and light on policy specifics. Clinton even took a veiled shot at President Barack Obama\u2019s administration for failing to prosecute individuals for banking crimes in the wake of the 2008 economic downturn. She accused hedge funds and high-frequency traders of \u201ccriminal behavior,\u201d and promised to \u201cprosecute individuals as well as firms\u201d when they break the law \u2013 which liberals have long clamored for, but the Obama administration largely didn\u2019t do. She also said she\u2019d seek to expand on the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial regulatory law designed to prevent future economic crises. \u201c\u2018Too big to fail\u2019 is still too big a problem,\u201d Clinton said. The assault on Wall Street pleased liberal groups that have often criticized Clinton. \u201cThere were notable overtures to the Elizabeth Warren wing of American politics, and nothing major for the dwindling DLC corporate crowd \u2013 which shows that Clinton sees a rising economic populist tide in our politics and wants to be part of it,\u201d said Adam Green, a founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee who has at times been a thorn in Clinton\u2019s side. Republican National Committee spokeswoman Allison Moore, meanwhile, hit Clinton for failing to explain how she\u2019d pay for the policies she\u2019s championing. Moore said that \u201cit\u2019s pretty clear: she will have to raise taxes on American families. If she doesn\u2019t raise taxes, then she will have to break her promises. \u201cThat\u2019s Clintonomics: tax hikes or broken promises,\u201d she said. \u201cThere\u2019s no way around it.\u201d Held at The New School, a university in lower Manhattan, the event was billed as Clinton\u2019s first major economic policy speech. She touched a long list of items she\u2019ll expound on in additional events over the summer, and included several sections \u2013 including the attack on Wall Street \u2013 that could help blunt the progressive dissatisfaction demonstrated in Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders\u2019 rapid rise up the Democratic primary polls. But Clinton didn\u2019t mention Sanders at all \u2013 and instead, she went after her potential Republican rivals. She laced the speech with assaults on three leading GOP presidential candidates: Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush for his comment that some Americans should work more hours; Florida Sen. Marco Rubio for a tax plan she said would benefit only the wealthy; and Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker for battling with labor unions. Those attacks signaled that Clinton believes her way to winning the Democratic nomination is by proving she\u2019s best able to take on Bush and other top Republicans in a general election, rather than locking horns with primary challengers. \u201cFor 35 years, Republicans have argued that if we give more wealth to those at the top by cutting their taxes and letting big corporations write their own rules, it will trickle down \u2013 it will trickle down to everyone else,\u201d Clinton said. Her attack on Bush was the sharpest. Clinton pointed to his comment that some Americans who work in a part-time economy need to take on more hours and said: \u201cThey don\u2019t need a lecture. They need a raise.\u201d She said two Democratic presidents before \u2013 Obama and Bill Clinton \u2013 have been charged with rescuing an economy that GOP presidents left in shambles. She praised Obama for bailing out the automotive industry and expanding access to health insurance. And she joked about her husband\u2019s title, while lauding his record. \u201cUnder President Clinton \u2013 I like the sound of that \u2013 America saw the longest peace-time expansion in our history,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cNearly 23 million jobs, a balanced budget and a surplus for the future. And most importantly, incomes rose across the board, not just for those already at the top.\u201d Clinton\u2019s speech was the product of more than 200 meetings between her policy team and a roster of outside advisers that includes economists like Nobel Prize winner Joseph Stiglitz. Clinton took many of the meetings herself, aides said. Drawing on decades of research, Clinton said the evolution of the \u201cgig economy\u201d \u2013 represented by companies like the ride-sharing Uber and housing renter Airbnb, which she made opaque references to without mentioning by name \u2013 and said it has undercut the stability and security that jobs have traditionally offered. Clinton said she favors tax reforms that would give companies incentives to share their profits with employees. She pitched an American infrastructure bank, as well as a renewed focus on clean energy and tax relief for small businesses. And she previewed her upcoming policy pitches on child care, paid sick leave and paid family leave. \u201cMany of these proposals are time-tested and more than a little battle-scarred,\u201d she said. Clinton is attemping to counter what she sees as a conservative-driven narrative in American politics that intervening in the economy on behalf of the middle class stymies job growth. \u201cThat\u2019s really not what the weight of economic evidence shows,\u201d said Heather Boushey, who has consulted with Clinton\u2019s campaign and is the executive director and chief economist at the Washington Center for Equitable Growth. \u201cYou can\u2019t accept a trade-off anymore that doesn\u2019t seem to hold water.\u201d Boushey said Clinton is \u201claying out an agenda that looks at what inequality means for families up and down the income distribution, what we can do to fix it, and it\u2019s really exciting to see a politician take up a very serious set of research ideas and bring them into the public debate.\u201d Her policy team is headed by Jake Sullivan, a former top aide to Clinton at the State Department and U.S. negotiator in the Iran nuclear talks, as well as Ann O\u2019Leary and Maya Harris, who both worked at the left-leaning Center for American Progress. Outside advisers have included a host of liberal economists, former government officials and more. Among them are the Noble Prize-winning economist Joseph Stiglitz, top Obama economic policy aides Gene Sperling, Christina Romer, David Kamin and Alan Krueger. Neera Tanden, a top 2008 Clinton campaign aide and now president of the Center for American Progress, was among the outside advisers, as were former Bill Clinton economist Alan Blinder, and economists Jacob Hacker, Ronnie Chatterji and Boushey.",

            "article_content": "Bernie Sanders has been running for president for two months, but Wednesday night in Madison, Wisconsin, his long-shot campaign got real. When Sanders walked on stage at the Veterans Memorial Coliseum, he was greeted by a raucous, howling crowd of 9,600 people, according to Sanders\u2019 campaign aides and arena staff. A clearly energized Sanders, who late last year was speaking to crowds of 50 people in Iowa classrooms, appeared taken aback by the reception he received. \u201cWhoa,\u201d he said. \u201cIn case you haven\u2019t noticed, there are a lot of people here.\u201d Sanders calls for a political revolution in Madison. pic.twitter.com/L5ZIztpHFH Sanders\u2019 campaign has been organizing the event for weeks, but just recently started telling reporters that 9,000 people signed up to attend. Hillary to step up attacks on Republicans RELATED: Clinton raised more than $45 million \u201cTonight we have made a little bit of history,\u201d he said. \u201cYou may know that some 25 candidates are running for president of the United States, but tonight we have more people at a meeting for a candidate for president of the United States than any other candidate has.\u201d Sanders delivered what amounted to his standard stump speech \u2013 a liberal message that pledges to fight for universal health care, break up the biggest banks in the United States and redistribute wealth from the richest Americans to the middle class and poor. \u201cWhat I would like to ask of you: Please think big, not small,\u201d Sanders said, referring to the audience as his \u201cbrothers and sisters.\u201d Calling for a \u201cpolitical revolution,\u201d Sanders added, \u201cthere is nothing that we cannot accomplish.\u201d Sanders, who is rising in the primary polls and trails only Hillary Clinton, only mentioned the former secretary of state once in his speech. \u201cThis campaign is not about Bernie Sanders, it is not about Hillary Clinton, it is not about anyone else, it is about you,\u201d Sanders said to sustained applause. Sanders worked the rope line after the event \u2013 something the Vermont senator rarely does. \u201cThe message is resonating, not just in Wisconsin, but all over America,\u201d Sanders told CNN. \u201cThe people are sick and tired of establishment politics, establishment economics. They want real change.\u201d Supporters were impressed by the performance. \u201cI felt like, this time, I want to be more of a participant in the election than I have been in the past,\u201d said Bethany Ragains, 24, who lives in suburban Chicago. \u201cI really felt a connection with Bernie on the issues. He makes me want to get more involved.\u201d Outside the event, Sanders\u2019 volunteers handed out stickers, sold t-shirts and, most importantly for the campaign, collected crucial data on each attendee. In addition to registering for the event through the Sanders\u2019 website, each person who walked in the door provided the campaign with their name, email, phone number and zip code. That is new for Sanders\u2019 operation; until recently the campaign was not collecting data on people who attended a speech or rally. But now that Sanders is drawing sizable numbers of people to events, his campaign is looking to translate the big turnouts into increased fundraising and an army of volunteers. Sanders closed his speech on Wednesday with a call to action that received the biggest applause of the night. \u201cI am more than aware that my opponents will be able to outspend us. But we are going to win this election,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cThey may have the money, but we have the people. And when the people stand together, we can win.\u201d After the Madison, Sanders heads to Rochester, Minnesota, for another rally.",

            "article_content": "Donald Trump's 2016 announcement speech mixed self-parody with substance Trump: \"I will be the greatest jobs president that God ever created\" Donald Trump has a new reality show: the 2016 presidential election. Boastful, ranting, unfiltered and breaking every single rule of politics, The Donald announced his bid for the presidency on Tuesday with the indignation of someone who is mad and not going to take it anymore. The bombastic billionaire, who hosts the NBC reality show \u201cThe Apprentice,\u201d provided his audience with the self-parody that many have come to expect along with flashes of substance that could have an unexpected impact on the race. He vowed to take on China and ISIS but also said he would build a great wall to stop Mexico from dumping \u201crapists\u201d on U.S. soil, questioned the intellect of Jeb Bush, branded U.S. leaders as \u201cstupid\u201d and lamented that \u201cthe American dream is dead.\u201d \u201cWe need somebody that literally will take this country and make it great again,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI will be the greatest jobs president that God ever created.\u201d Trump\u2019s rationale for a White House race is that, at least in his own mind, he is wealthier and more successful than anyone else. \u201cI\u2019m really rich \u2013 that\u2019s the kind of mindset, that\u2019s the kind of thinking you need for this country,\u201d he said. \u201cSomebody said, \u2018Oh, that\u2019s crass.\u2019 It\u2019s not crass.\u2019\u201d Donald Trump's best lines during his 2016 speech READ: Trump jumps in: The Donald\u2019s latest White House run is officially on Immediately after Trump\u2019s performance, S.E. Cupp, a CNN political analyst, could only say \u201cthere is no way to describe what happened.\u201d Most presidential candidates seek to project a down-home image on campaign launch day, striving for humility and a connection with everyday Americans, often choosing to conceal their personal wealth at a time when the middle class is struggling. Not Trump. At the foot of the gleaming Trump Tower in New York, the real estate mogul seemed intent on showing everyone just how rich he is, boasting about his sumptuous golf courses, huge building projects and an accounting sheet that lists his assets at over $9 billion. Trump is handing the GOP a set of troublesome questions. Perhaps most significantly, GOP bosses must work out how to stop the party race \u2013 already inundated with 12 candidates and with more to come \u2013 from descending into a farcical personal showcase for The Donald. Party leaders have been desperate to head off the kind of polarizing circus that overtook the GOP debates in 2012. But Trump could find himself with a spot in the top 10 in national polls, a ranking that could guarantee him a place in Republican debates starting later this summer. Republican operatives had little to say about Trump\u2019s entry to the race on Tuesday. \u201cWe have a historic crop of candidates seeking the Republican nomination,\u201d Spicer told CNN, adding that Trump\u2019s blast against Mexicans was not \u201chelpful\u201d to the GOP cause. The Club for Growth, an influential free market lobby group, was more dismissive of Trump\u2019s claims. \u201cDonald Trump is a great entertainer and developer but his idea of what to do as president won\u2019t grow the economy,\u201d said David McIntosh, the group\u2019s president. It would be easy to dismiss Trump as a joke candidate, especially with his lack of a record running for office or a recognizable political campaign structure. READ: Donald Trump thinks pretty much everyone is a loser But J. Ann Selzer, who conducts the Des Moines Register/Bloomberg Iowa Poll and is president of Selzer & Company, noted that Trump\u2019s name, fame and direct style will give him advantages, particularly in a crowded GOP field. Though he is in the single digits in Iowa, Selzer noted that he could get traction and gain the few points needed to secure a position among the top candidates who will get in the debates. At the same time, she noted that Trump, who went to Iowa after his announcement, has \u201cvery high negatives\u2026 In fact his negatives outnumber by positive by more than two to one.\u201d \u201cOne of the things he has going for him \u2014 and against him \u2014 is people know him,\u201d Selzer said. In focus groups, some Iowans have said they want a candidate like Trump who have run a big organization, she said. At the same time, \u201cYou have people who say I despise him, who say \u2018he just wants attention\u2019\u2026 They have a hard time taking him seriously.\u201d She added: \u201cWe\u2019ll see how plays his hand.\u201d Trump showed how he may be able to tap into the hunger among many voters for a blunt-talking candidate who answers questions without hesitation. While other GOP candidates were careful not to go too far in criticizing former Florida Gov. Bush as he flubbed his answer on whether he would have invaded Iraq, Trump noted that Bush stumbled repeatedly over his answer \u2014 and questioned his readiness to be president for that reason alone. The media \u2013 and the rest of the political world \u2013 is going to have to work out how to treat him,  presumably taking him at his word as a genuine candidate with as much right to be heard as anyone else. As Trump pointed out, he doesn\u2019t need to worry about cash, with plenty of his own money to throw into a campaign and potentially cause trouble for his fellow Republican hopefuls late into the primary process. \u201cIt\u2019s nice. I don\u2019t need anybody\u2019s money. I\u2019m using my own money,\u201d Trump said. But no matter how much money Trump has to spend on his presidential campaign, he faces enormous hurdles, particularly in demonstrating to voters how he would navigate the gauntlet of the early Republican primary states and emerge strong enough to take on Hillary Clinton, the Democrat\u2019s likely nominee. Though Trump\u2019s speech Tuesday was rambling and bombastic, it also showed the power of his appeal to blue collar voters who are concerned about the declining standing of the U.S. around the world and the growing power of China\u2019s economy. He touted his business experience to argue that he could streamline government. He noted at one point that he has launched many websites and he can build them for $3 \u2014 comparing those nimble efforts to the expensive, faltering technology of the federal exchange that initially hobbled the implementation of President Obama\u2019s healthcare law. And as much as anything\u2019s Trump\u2019s performance seemed born of a desire to buck up America after a rough time that has turned many people against more conventional politicians. \u201cWe don\u2019t have victories anymore,\u201d Trump complained. \u201cWe used to have victories, but we don\u2019t have them.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Promising economic mobility and championing the middle class are key themes for candidates from both sides of the political aisle as the 2016 presidential campaign gets underway. Most of the candidates don\u2019t have to worry about so much about their own finances. During her first campaign trip to Iowa Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton said \u201cThere\u2019s something wrong when CEO\u2019s make 300 times more than the typical worker,\u201d highlighting income inequality as one of her top priorities. According to the Center for Responsive Politics, Clinton is worth an estimated $15,300,000. She could continue to make more money as the campaign progresses. Former President Bill Clinton told NBC he will continue to charge six-figure speaking fees while his wife runs because he has \u201cto pay our bills.\u201d The Clintons are wealthy, but they don\u2019t have the financial security of former Hewlett-Packard CEO Carly Fiorina, a Republican and the only other woman in the race. She is estimated to have more than four times as much as Clinton, with a net worth of $80 million. Fiorina is by far the richest candidate currently in the race. Retired neurosurgeon and author Dr. Ben Carson and former Arkansas Governor Mike Huckabee tried to play down their wealth by focusing on their humble roots. Huckabee, who enjoyed a lucrative career as a Fox News host after his failed 2008 bid for president, owns a multimillion dollar beachfront home in Santa Rosa Beach but chose to announce his candidacy from his hometown of Hope, Arkansas. Huckabee indirectly referenced his fellow hometown politician, former President Bill Clinton, and took a swipe at the Clintons\u2019 wealth: \u201cI don\u2019t have a global foundation or a taxpayer-funded check to live off of. I grew up blue collared, not blue blooded,\u201d said Huckabee. Texas Senator Ted Cruz is estimated to be worth a little over $3 million, while Senator Rand Paul is worth an estimated net worth of $1,300,000, according to the Center for Responsive Politics data. Not all of the candidates are millionaires. Florida Senator Marco Rubio, a Republican, has an estimated net worth of $443,500, and independent Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, who is running against Clinton for the Democratic nomination, are at the bottom of the pack of official candidates. Sanders, a self-proclaimed socialist and a staunch critic of Wall Street, has an estimated net worth of $330,507, making him the poorest candidate currently in the race. \u201cWe now have a political situation where billionaires are literally able to buy elections and candidates,\u201d said Sanders. Rubio spoke about his humble upbringing while announcing his presidential bid in Miami \u201cWhen they were young my parents had big dreams for themselves \u2026 but because they were not born into wealth or power, their future was destined to be defined by their past \u2026 Here in America, my father became a bartender, my mother a cashier, a maid, a K-Mart stock clerk.\u201d Towards the end of his speech Rubio referenced his parents again and said: \u201cI live in an exceptional country where even the son of a bartender and a maid can have the same dreams.\u201d",

And it was a marked effort to downplay the divide within the Democratic Party that contributed to Sanders\u2019 decision to launch a bid, between progressives clamoring for a challenger to Clinton and the large majority of Democrats who support her for the nomination. READ: Bernie Sanders is running for president Clinton has maintained a decisive, double-digit lead in every survey of the prospective Democratic presidential field, drawing from 50-70% support among Democrats.

But his entry into the race poses risks for the Democratic Party as well, if the party infighting overshadows the contrast with Republicans that Democrats are hoping to draw in the race. Sanders, for his part, has indicated he has no intentions to pull punches in the race.

Sanders declares presidential candidacy \u201cIt tells me what is a very serious problem,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not just about Hillary Clinton or Bill Clinton.

            "article_content": "President Barack Obama might give Hillary Clinton the best gift any sitting president can offer their potential successor: a strong economy. For the first time since Obama took office more than six years ago, significantly more Americans say the national economy is \u201cgood\u201d rather than \u201cpoor,\u201d while six in 10 people are optimistic that the economy will be in good shape a year from now, according to the latest CNN/ORC poll. The recent upturn in the economic recovery, marked by a 5.5% unemployment rate \u2014 the lowest level since May of 2008 \u2013 is a welcome and long-awaited development for the second-term president, who assumed office at the height of the financial crisis. It also comes as Clinton has hit the campaign trail as a presidential candidate for the second time. A broadly favorable view of the Obama economy could be a potentially powerful tool for the former secretary of state as she seeks to convince voters that the country will be better off with another Democratic president than a Republican in the White House. READ: Obama pushes trade agenda despite Democratic opposition Clinton and her Democratic colleagues will want to leave themselves maneuvering room in case the recovery hits unexpected road bumps \u2014 there are still 18 months left until Election Day, after all. But in light of CNN\u2019s newest poll and a recent spate of positive economic data, analysts widely predict that come 2016, the Obama recovery is poised to be one of his party\u2019s biggest assets. \u201cI do think we will continue to see economic growth not just through the rest of this year but through the rest of 2016. There aren\u2019t those imbalances out there that would raise concerns about a potential recession any time soon,\u201d said Gus Faucher, a senior economist with PNC. \u201cWhoever the Democratic nominee is, he or she will be running on the message of: the economy is getting better and let\u2019s continue with those policies.\u201d Recent labor market data offer a clear demonstration of just how far the recovery has come since the president took office in 2009. In 2012, GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney repeatedly slammed Obama for lackluster growth and made the economy the central pillar of his campaign platform. Two years earlier, Republicans campaigned on the mantra of, \u201cWhere are the jobs?\u201d At the end of 2012, the unemployment rate still lingered around 8%. By November 2012, employment growth had averaged around 150,000 per month that year. Now, those numbers read quite differently. In March, the unemployment rate was 5.5%, and over the last year, the economy has added an average of 269,000 jobs per month, according to the Labor Department. READ: Meet the woman who might hold the keys to Hillary\u2019s White House bid Consumer confidence has also come a long way \u2014 the University of Michigan\u2019s survey of consumers this month showed that consumer optimism was at the second highest level since 2007. \u201cThe economic question in 2016 isn\u2019t just, is the economy getting better or not, but whose policy agenda seems more consistent with keeping it that way?\u201d said Jared Bernstein, former economic adviser to Vice President Joe Biden. In a meeting with local elected officials in New Hampshire Tuesday, Clinton said she believes more voters are starting to appreciate the president\u2019s policy decisions. \u201cShe said people are coming around, understanding that what President Obama has done is good. A lot of what he has done is worthwhile,\u201d state Rep. Geoffrey Hirsch of Bradford told CNN after an hour-long meeting with Clinton. Hirsch added: \u201cI know Obama\u2019s ties or coattails were kind of destructive in the midterms, especially here in New Hampshire, but I think she senses that people are coming around.\u201d Still, in her first remarks as a declared candidate, Clinton has been careful not to oversell the broader economic progress by cautioning that the middle class needs more of a boost. \u201cAmericans have fought their way back from tough economic times, but the deck is still stacked in favor of those at the top,\u201d Clinton said in her announcement video. The restrained rhetoric in part reflects several weak spots that continue to irk economists \u2013 chief among them,  sluggish wage growth. Stephen Moore, an economic fellow at the Heritage Foundation who has been meeting with a range of 2016 Republican candidates, said weak wage growth is one of the clearest signs of why it\u2019s still premature for Democrats to fully embrace the Obama economy. \u201cThe Republican line has to be, where\u2019s the pay raise, Mr. President?\u201d Moore said. \u201cYou keep talking about middle class economics but the middle class has really been hammered over the last six years under this recovery.\u201d",

There\u2019s so much baggage after Clinton\u2019s stinging caucus loss seven years ago that her debut trip to the first-in-the-nation state as the prohibitive 2016 front runner was always going to be a delicate one. But Clinton wrapped up the first swing of her new White House campaign Tuesday night after building bridges with key party members and state lawmakers. As she prepared to return home to New York \u2013 flying commercial instead of riding in her \u201cScooby\u201d van \u2013 senior Democrats signaled approval at her low key, humble approach. READ: Hillary Clinton\u2019s no-frills campaign \u201cI think she is on the right track, she is starting out slow and easy,\u201d said Jerry Tormey, co-chair of the Urbandale, Iowa, Democratic Party. \u201cShe is meeting people one-on-one in small groups. I think that needs to happen to make sure she is hearing what the people have to say.\u201d Both Clinton and Iowa Democrats have an interest in burying the hatchet. The former secretary of state is pledging to fight for every vote but she might be even more inevitable this time for the party nomination than she was in 2008, giving both sides an incentive to play nice. Privately, many Democrats here acknowledge that Clinton, rather than alternatives like former Maryland Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley or former Sen. Jim Webb, is easily their best hope of keeping the White House. Still, there was plenty for outsiders to complain about in Clinton\u2019s two-day stay. Journalists were fuming at a lack of access, and Republicans accused her of appearing before tiny, tame audiences lobbing softball questions. Clinton did not shed any light on the controversy over her private email server \u2013 even as reports surfaced that she was asked directly about the issue in 2012. There were no challenges to her tenure running President Barack Obama\u2019s contentious foreign policy. And other sensitive issues, such as her family foundation\u2019s decision to continue taking foreign donations or her belief in a \u201cconstitutional right\u201d to same sex marriage, were addressed in carefully crafted statements. READ: Hillary Clinton has a new position on same-sex marriage Her freshly modulated political convictions seemed to contain inconsistencies. Clinton railed against hedge fund managers who make astronomical sums of money \u2013 even though she just left the corporate speaking circuit where she commanded several hundred thousands dollars a pop. She promised to back a constitutional amendment to sort out campaign finance abuses \u2013 but is expected to pile up at least a billion dollars for her own presidential ambitions. She failed to offer any policy specifics and skipped past the big questions hanging over her 2016 campaign, among them, can she avoid the backstabbing staff turmoil that marred her 2008 effort?  Can a Democrat win a third consecutive presidential term in 2016? And is America ready for the dynastic politics the Clintons\u2019 return to the White House would represent? Journalists hunt for Hillary in Iowa But from Clinton\u2019s point of view, those questions can wait. This journey from New York to Iowa by van \u2013 via gas stations, coffee shops and a Chipotle \u2013 was about presenting her as sympathetic to the stretched bank accounts of \u201cEveryday Americans\u201d and offering a mea culpa to Iowans who play their role of vetting the presidential field with almost religious intensity. Clinton, a former first lady, senator and secretary of state, presented herself as the \u201cchampion\u201d of the middle class, and vowed to build an economy for the future. This seemed to mirror Obama\u2019s successful 2012 gambit of branding the GOP the party of the rich. She also took a swipe at convincing Americans she has a deep seated desire to be president \u2013 not just personal ambition. \u201cI just felt like I couldn\u2019t walk away from what I see as the challenges we face,\u201d Clinton said. Her campaign appeared to be trying to pitch her effort at the same register as the famous New Hampshire scene from 2008, in which she choked up when trying to explain how hard she wanted to fight for American families. READ: Congress asked Clinton about emails in 2012 But Clinton also had an explicit message for Iowans: she understands that last time, she came across as entitled, unsympathetic and insufficiently attentive to the personal touch many here crave before promising their vote. Clinton never had a close connection to Iowa and in 2008, her campaign, realizing its problem in the state, once mulled bypassing the caucuses altogether. Many senior members of her campaign believed that Iowa\u2019s role in the campaign far outweighed its size and significance. But she stayed in and her aides watched in dismay when the state swooned at Barack Obama\u2019s liberal, anti-war agenda. She only placed third in the caucuses \u2013 a humiliation from which she never recovered. Until this week, Clinton\u2019s last, bitter memory of Iowa as a presidential candidate was a late night flight to New Hampshire on the night of the 2008 rout, in which she and her staff huddled in shock at the front of her campaign plane. But in a classic sign of the penchant for re-invention and comebacks the Clintons have often used to bounce back from political scrapes, the former secretary of state tried for a do-over with Iowans. \u201cBelieve me, I know that it\u2019s not going to be easy, that I\u2019m going to have to work hard to earn every single vote and get every caucus-goer I can round up to show up next February,\u201d she said during the first event of her campaign, an education roundtable in Monticello, Iowa on Tuesday. READ: Live from New York: It\u2019s \u2018Hillary Clinton\u2019 Clinton\u2019s willingness to munch on humble pie seemed to be appreciated, even among those who don\u2019t identify as Democrats. Mick Starcevich, President of Kirkwood College, where Clinton appeared, said he was an independent and had not yet decided how to cast his 2016 vote but lauded her for holding an intimate conversation in front of 20 or so people, rather than a booming campaign launch rally. \u201cI would say this was really softball. But you have got to have that,\u201d he said. \u201cThis was so far from a rally (and) that is why I really value it, for what she was trying to accomplish.\u201d While Clinton\u2019s gesture was appreciated, this was just a first step, and there is a lot of work left for her to do to win Iowans over. More than anything, Iowans appear to want a contest in 2016. With memories of the electrifying race seven years ago still fresh in their minds, Democrats are looking rather enviously at the building GOP clash. Caucus contests are vitally important for the Iowa parties to find new voters and encourage grassroots supporters, in a perennial swing state. Democrats are still licking their wounds after wavering voters stayed home in last fall\u2019s midterm elections, allowing rising Republican star Joni Ernst to capture a Senate seat. \u201cFirst, I think there will be a very robust caucus. It\u2019s very important to us. What the caucuses are \u2013 they are about party building,\u201d said Dr. Andy McGuire, who chairs the Iowa Democratic Party. Some Clinton aides privately hope that their candidate does draw a Democratic challenge, possibly from O\u2019Malley, Webb or independent Sen. Bernie Sanders, believing it would sharpen her skills for the general election. And there are enough Democrats in Iowa who are not sold on Clinton to give another candidate a chance to significantly heighten their profile. Some activists are still pining for Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren to make the race, despite her frequent renunciations of interest. Many here contrast Warren\u2019s populist streak with what many Democrats believe is Clinton\u2019s cozyness with Wall Street and lack of affinity to the middle class. \u201cThe reason I am not as excited about Hillary is that Elizabeth Warren has come for where the majority of us have been,\u201d said Ready for Warren activist Brenda Brink, from the small town of Huxley outside Des Moines. \u201cHillary Clinton has forgotten all that and forgotten where people are still \u2013 which is still struggling.\u201d Republicans in Iowa also watched Clinton\u2019s trip closely and are vowing to make the race here a referendum not just on her economic plans and  record as secretary of state \u2013 but on her character. \u201cWe absolutely welcome any candidate who wants to come but I think Hillary is trying to rebrand herself,\u201d said Jennifer Smith, chair of the Republican Party in Dubuque County. \u201cHere in Iowa we like sincerity, we like people to be authentic, that\u2019s really not what she has been doing here.\u201d While conservatives would poke holes in Clinton\u2019s tactics whatever she did \u2013 Wall Street Journal columnist Peggy Noonan called her tour the most \u201cinept, phony, shallow, slickily-slick and meaningless\u201d one she\u2019s ever seen \u2013 it\u2019s clear that the front-running Democrat is right to take nothing for granted. As a one time \u201cinevitable\u201d front runner whose White House hopes crashed in Iowa, Clinton must still wake up late at night and wonder if lightning may strike twice. \u201cIowa is kind of the place for a dark horse candidate,\u201d said Tormey of the Urbandale, Iowa, Democratic Party. \u201cIs there a possibility that somebody could come along? Anything is possible.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Hillary Clinton used Times Magazine\u2019s 100 Most Influential People list to pay tribute to Elizabeth Warren, a lawmaker some liberals hope will challenge the former secretary of state for the 2016 Democratic nomination. In the short piece, Clinton touts Warren as a champion for the middle class and nods to the duos interesting relationship when she writes that Warren \u201cnever hesitates to hold powerful people\u2019s feet to the fire: bankers, lobbyists, senior government officials and, yes, even presidential aspirants.\u201d \u201cElizabeth Warren\u2019s journey from janitor\u2019s daughter to Harvard professor to public watchdog to U.S. Senator has been driven by an unflagging determination to level the playing field for hardworking American families like the one she grew up with in Oklahoma,\u201d Clinton writes. \u201cShe fights so hard for others to share in the American Dream because she lived it herself.\u201d Some liberal activists have protested Clinton\u2019s presidential candidacy by looking to to urge the Massachusetts senator to run. Warren has repeatedly denied that she is running or will run and she even disavowed one of the draft campaigns. But Warren has not been overwhelmingly supportive of Clinton\u2019s run, either. When asked about the former first lady\u2019s candidacy, Warren usually punts the question. \u201cI think we need to give her a chance\u2026 to lay out what she wants to run on. I think that is her opportunity to\u201d champion issues the senators feels are important, Warren said on NBC\u2019s \u201cToday\u201d when asked if Clinton was the right messenger for the Democratic Party. Despite the outside pressure to pin them against each other, Warren and Clinton do have a friendly relationship, according to aides. Clinton has sought advice from the Massachusetts senator \u201cseveral times\u201d in the last year, a source with knowledge of Clinton\u2019s plans told CNN in February, a sign of how important Warren\u2019s wing of the Democratic party is to the foundation of a would-be presidential bid for the former secretary of state. Clinton also made Time\u2019s 100 list. Her entry was written by Laurene Powell Jobs, the founder of Emerson Collective. \u201cShe is one of America\u2019s greatest modern creations,\u201d Powell Jobs writes. \u201cHer decades in our public life must not blind us to the fact that she represents new realities and possibilities.\u201d Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul also gave tribute to a political force that\u2019s certain to influence his presidential run \u2014\u00a0Charles and David Koch, the billionaire brothers behind a network of outside spending groups that are expected to spend nearly $1 billion in the upcoming election. But Paul, in his Time 100 blurb on the brothers, downplays their campaign spending and instead highlights \u201ctheir passion for freedom and their commitment to ideas,\u201d which he says is \u201cunderappreciated.\u201d \u201cUnlike many crony capitalists who troll the halls of Congress looking for favors, the Kochs have consistently lobbied against special-interest politics,\u201d Paul writes. \u201cFor decades they have funded institutes that promote ideas, not politics, such as Cato and the Mercatus Center.\u201d He also touts their support for criminal-justice reform, a pet project of his. While Paul closes by proclaiming that their investments in \u201cfreedom-loving think tanks will carry on for generations,\u201d their reported plans to spend $889 million during the 2016 election cycle will certainly have a long-lasting impact on the country as well. A number of others high profile political figures made Time\u2019s list, including former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, President Barack Obama and Tennessee Sen. Bob Corker.",

Chafee all but declared his candidacy, saying: \u201cI want to be on the stage in November, December and January debating these issues.\u201d His biggest problem with Clinton, Chafee said Sunday, is her vote in favor of President George W. Bush\u2019s war in Iraq. \u201cThat was a moment where the premise for going to Iraq was so false that there were weapons of mass destruction, she didn\u2019t do her homework. We live with the ramifications,\u201d Chafee said. \u201cYou may say that\u2019s 12 years ago \u2013 that\u2019s a big motivator for me running. If you show a lack of judgment, lack of doing homework then, what can we expect in the future?\u201d He also blasted her tenure as President Barack Obama\u2019s first-term secretary of state. Her time as America\u2019s top diplomat, Chafee said, \u201cwas kind of a muscular, top-down, unilateral, too close to neo-cons, too Bush-like.\u201d It ended, he said, with \u201cprecious few\u201d accomplishments. Chafee also said he\u2019ll court the liberal backers of Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, who has said she won\u2019t challenge Clinton, pointing to his opposition to Bush-era tax cuts as evidence that he\u2019s focused on income inequality. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt that Sen. Warren\u2019s absolutely right about what\u2019s happening to the middle class,\u201d Chafee said. \u201cShe\u2019s just been a prophet about this for a number of years.\u201d Chafee was defeated for re-election to the Senate, where he had served as a Republican, by Democrat Sheldon Whitehouse in 2006. He was elected to one term as Rhode Island governor as an independent in 2010. Chafee later became a Democrat, and then ultimately chose not to seek re-election in 2014 when his fundraising and poll numbers lagged behind his challengers. He defended his party switch, saying it was the GOP that evolved. \u201cCertainly the Republican Party changed and I never changed,\u201d Chafee said. \u201cAs I became an independent my values never changed whether it\u2019s on fiscal responsibility, environment or using government tools to help the less fortunate.\u201d",

Bush\u2019s spokeswoman, Kristy Campbell, confirmed Wednesday that Bush will attend the event in the Hawkeye State, which holds the first nominating contests in presidential election years. Former Texas Gov. Rick Perry, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, former Sen. Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania and real estate titan Donald Trump are also confirmed for the event. Other invited speakers include a range of potential Republican and Democratic presidential candidates, including Hillary Clinton and Joe Biden. Bush\u2019s scheduled speaking slot was first reported by the Des Moines Register. The former Florida governor makes his first major public address Wednesday since announcing in December he was actively exploring a presidential bid, though he hasn\u2019t officially announced a campaign. He\u2019s set to pitch a message at the Detroit Economic Club that he\u2019s a \u201creform conservative\u201d and will offer an optimistic view for how to help the middle class. Bush skipped the most recent cattle call in Iowa last month, when close to 10 potential GOP presidential candidates addressed an assembly of core caucus goers in Des Moines.

            "article_content": "Six years after taking office amid a deep economic recession, President Barack Obama is looking back on his successes with a smile. \u201cI\u2019m proud of saving the economy,\u201d Obama told CNN\u2019s Fareed Zakaria in an interview on Tuesday when asked what he is most proud of accomplishing as president. Obama conceded that \u201cwe still have a long way to go,\u201d but said that his administration stabilized the economy and laid a \u201cnew foundation to move forward.\u201d READ: Obama says Netanyahu\u2019s visit is too close to the Israeli election for a meeting Just a week before, Obama touted in his State of the Union address the \u201cfastest economic growth in over a decade\u201d and pledged to build on those gains by focusing on expanding the middle class. \u201cI think we\u2019ve moved the trend lines in the right direction but we\u2019ve still got a long way to go on that,\u201d Obama said. Unemployment is at its lowest since 2008, the stock market is surging and a host of other economic indicators show the U.S. making a comeback \u2013 a comeback Obama is flaunting and taking credit for more and more as he embarks on the fourth quarter of his presidency and looks to define his legacy. But Obama\u2019s message of economic recovery has been fiercely criticized by Republicans who say the economy has been growing too slowly and argue many Americans have yet to feel the kick of an economy on the upswing. Obama wouldn\u2019t say directly what his defining and enduring legacy would be. \u201cLet somebody else answer that question,\u201d he said. SEE ALSO: Obama defends Saudi relationship Even without a direct answer, Obama\u2019s list of the proudest moments of his presidency make it clear he hopes to be remembered for steering the U.S. out of the greatest economic downturn since the Great Depression, for making good on his commitment to withdraw American troops from Iraq and Afghanistan and for repositioning the U.S. in the world through diplomatic initiatives that mark a major shift from his predecessor\u2019s foreign policy. \u201cSometimes progress is incremental, but when I look at overall, the steps that we\u2019ve taken, I believe they are the right ones,\u201d Obama said. \u201cAnd I am very confident that America is stronger, more prosperous, safer, and more influential today than it was when I took office.\u201d Those contentions are far from settled, though, particularly on the international front as the U.S. stares down new and old challenges. Proponents of a more forceful foreign policy continue to castigate Obama for underestimating ISIS, failing to reach an agreement on a residual U.S. force in Iraq and not doing enough in Syria to oppose President Bashar el-Assad and bolster moderate opposition forces early on. And Republicans are pouncing on Obama for the increasingly tense geopolitical rivalry with Russia, asserting that Obama\u2019s approach to dealing with Vladimir Putin was too na\u00efve. Obama is also facing pushback from Republicans and some Democrats for his rapprochement with Cuba, which Obama also touted in his interview with Zakaria. His wager on diplomacy faces perhaps its toughest test yet in the coming months as his administration looks to lock in an agreement with Iran to curb its nuclear program \u2013 a diplomatic foray to which Obama has devoted significant political capital both at home and abroad and which he acknowledged earlier in January only has a \u201cprobably less than 50-50\u201d chance of success. But speaking with Zakaria in New Delhi, India after a productive three-day visit, Obama also pointed to his work to strengthen partnerships with Asian partners \u2013 trading partners, specifically \u2013 including with India. \u201cStrengthening alliances with countries like India, where there\u2019s just enormous potential, and sometimes we don\u2019t pay a lot of attention to it, but I\u2019ve been paying a lot of attention to it.  Because I think that our future prosperity and security is going to be tied up with how we\u2019re doing with 1.2 billion aspiring Indians who share our values and share democracy with us,\u201d Obama said.",

            "article_content": "Gov. Chris Christie and Mitt Romney will have dinner Friday night in New York City, just hours after Romney announced he won\u2019t be seeking a third run for president. According to a source familiar with the dinner, their wives may also attend. The two men are friends. \u201cReal friends, not political friends,\u201d as Christie has previously said. The source warned against expecting Romney to endorse anyone in the near future, or perhaps at all, saying the 2012 GOP nominee will be out helping the party, but not necessarily for any one 2016 candidate. Romney is in New York Friday to attend a private lunch event for the Ann Romney Center for Neurologic Diseases at Brigham and Women\u2019s Hospital. An aide to Romney said the dinner is a \u201csocial meeting\u201d and \u201cwas arranged a while ago.\u201d Christie was vetted in 2012 to be Romney\u2019s potential running mate, but it was later made public in the book \u201cDouble Down\u201d that concerns came up during the vetting process about Christie\u2019s health and weight, as well as a controversy involving Christie\u2019s time as a federal prosecutor in New Jersey. Romney aides and supporters also came to resent Christie after he teamed up with President Barack Obama a week before the election to survey damage in New Jersey after Superstorm Sandy. Critics argued that Christie\u2019s praise of Obama at the time elevated the president just days before voters headed to the polls. Romney later said he had no bad feelings against Christie about the episode. \u201cYou have to look at Chris and say this is a guy who\u2019s been a very effective governor and has a great potential for leadership,\u201d Romney told CNN\u2019s Gloria Borger in 2013. About a year ago, when being pressed about a third run for president, Romney instead pointed to Christie and other Republicans as potentially strong GOP nominees. \u201cI want to make sure that we take the country in a different direction. I think that Chris Christie and Paul Ryan and Jeb Bush and Scott Walker, and the list goes on, have a much better chance of doing that, and so I will support one of them as they become the nominee,\u201d Romney told the New York Times. It was one of many times Romney praised the New Jersey governor last year. Romney appeared as a special guest at Christie\u2019s birthday fundraiser in New Jersey last September. They shared the same stage at an event that in many ways appeared to foreshadow a potential campaign event if Christie were to run for president, complete with a highly complimentary introduction by Romney, an American flag as a backdrop, and an excited audience. \u201cThis is a guy who cares about the people in this great state, he cares about the poor, he cares about the middle class. He cares about getting good jobs,\u201d Romney said. \u201cThis is a guy who fights for the things he believes in.\u201d The love-fest continued when Christie was at the podium. \u201cWouldn\u2019t our country be a hell of a better place if this man were the President of the United States?\u201d Christie roared.\u200b",

            "article_content": "Sens. Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz and Rand Paul debated foreign policy Sunday night They sat on stage for a panel hosted by the Koch brothers It was the first time potential presidential candidates shared a stage at the same time this year Three likely presidential candidates shared the stage Sunday night before a roomful of wealthy donors, engaging in a rapid-fire policy discussion that underscored sharp disagreement within the GOP over global affairs and national security. Republican Sens. Marco Rubio, Ted Cruz and Rand Paul took part in a largely friendly, but occasionally fiery, panel at the Palm Springs event sponsored by mega GOP donors David and Charles Koch, better known as the Koch Brothers. The event, moderated by ABC\u2019s Jonathan Karl, marked the first time potential GOP contenders gathered on the same stage at the same time to talk about policy in 2015, a year that\u2019s expected to see a hoard of candidates compete for the Republican nomination in forums and debates. RELATED: 2016 race kicks off with auditions in Iowa It also offered a window into the unofficial campaign that\u2019s largely playing out behind the scenes, with White House hopefuls traveling the country and meeting privately with donors \u2014 in settings much like the California desert Sunday \u2014 to gauge the kind of the financial commitments they could secure for a 2016 endeavor. The first-term senators were keenly aware of their immediate audience \u2014 at one point Cruz blatantly said, \u201cI admire Charles and David Koch\u201d \u2014 but knowing their remarks would be public, they also sought to show off their command of the issues in a high-pressure scenario. The senators revealed little disparity on domestic and economic policies, but roughly half way into the event, the discussion shifted toward President Barack Obama\u2019s new Cuba policy \u2014 and Paul instantly found himself on defense. \u201cI\u2019m kind of surrounded on this,\u201d Paul joked. Rubio and Cruz both have parents who emigrated from Cuba, and Paul is also the odd-man-out on substance, being the only one on stage who\u2019s backed the President\u2019s call for relaxing the Cuba embargo. The Kentucky Republican explained that in hindsight, President Richard Nixon \u201cmade the right decision\u201d by opening relations with China, saying it prevented war and opened up trade. \u201cChina not a good example,\u201d Rubio disagreed, saying the country may be \u201cmore prosperous\u2026but it is not a free country.\u201d That launched the two into a deeper debate over whether the U.S. should place sanctions against all countries with a record of human rights violations. \u201cI\u2019m not a big fan of a lot of these regimes but I don\u2019t want to isolate ourselves and not trade with people who aren\u2019t perfect,\u201d Paul said. His answer was also a masked response to critics who label him an isolationist due to his push for less intervention abroad. Rubio, answering Paul, stressed that Cuba stands out because of its close proximity to the U.S. \u201cThe difference is that Cuba\u2019s 90 miles from our shores,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cWhat happens there we will feel immediately.\u201d The negotiations with Iran over its nuclear weapons program also became a major flash point on the panel. Paul is supporting Obama\u2019s push to avoid imposing sanctions against Iran while the negotiations are still ongoing. \u201cDiplomacy is a good thing, not a bad thing,\u201d Paul said. His argument, however, failed to generate much excitement in the room. That\u2019s when Rubio swooped in to warn that the U.S. is dealing with a country that\u2019s run by someone whose mission is \u201cto bring the whole world under the flag of Islam.\u201d \u201cSo I am a little cautious\u2026about negotiating with someone who has openly said he wants to force all of us to either be like him or die,\u201d he said, generating a strong response from the audience. Cruz also won heavy applause when he underlined the threat of Islamic extremism, declaring that a nuclear Iran would be the single biggest threat to the U.S. and argued Ayatollah Khomeini and the country\u2019s leaders are \u201cradical religious Islamic nutcases\u201d who \u201cglorify death or suicide.\u201d Combating Islamic extremism was a common theme Saturday when potential candidates, including Cruz, took turns speaking at a marathon event in Iowa, where attacks on Obama\u2019s foreign policy, in particular with regard to ISIS, stirred some of the loudest responses from the audience. Each of the senators delivered an impressive grasp of the issues, firing off statistics on a wide range of topics and punctuating their positions with personal stories that touched on their own background. But it was Rubio who commanded the most time, delivering fast-paced but forceful answers. He jumped first at questions and frequently sat on the edge of his seat as he would crescendo into some of his more impassioned arguments, like on Cuba or Iran. Style-wise, Rubio sported a suit and looked the part of his day job, while Paul donned a navy sport coat with blue jeans, and Cruz wore the same tan colored coat he wore to a conservative event in Iowa the day prior. Rubio, who has already said he won\u2019t run for re-election to his Senate seat in 2016 if he runs for president, held the middle seat of three seats and drew frequent laugh lines in addition to applause. When Karl asked if the super wealthy have too much influence on elections, Rubio made the audience roar when he quickly rattled off a snarky response that both validated his audience and took a shot at the left. \u201cAs opposed to Hollywood or the mainstream media, you mean?\u201d While all three men praised Mitt Romney on a personal level, none expressed any faith that the 2012 GOP nominee would be successful in another bid at the White House. Paul said Romney would have been a better president than Obama, but when asked if a revised Romney campaign would fare better in 2016, the Kentucky Republican joked: \u201cI\u2019m kind of with Ann Romney on this one \u2018No. No. No. No. Never\u2019.\u201d (It was actually Mitt, not his wife Ann, who repeated the word \u201cno\u201d 11 times to the New York Times last year when asked if he planned to run again) The next nominee, Paul argued, needs to be someone who can \u201creach out and appeal to new constituencies,\u201d and he questioned whether the millionaire with a long history in politics would be able to strike that \u201cvisceral connection\u201d with \u201cenough people to win a general election.\u201d For his part, Cruz used Romney\u2019s infamous comments about nearly half the country being dependent on government to illustrate his case against the 2012 nominee. \u201cThe reason Republicans lost can be summed up in two words: Forty-seven percent,\u201d the Texas Republican said. \u201cI don\u2019t just mean Mitt Romney\u2019s comments that were caught on tape\u2026 the central narrative of the last election, what the voters heard, was we don\u2019t have to worry about the 47%.\u201d \u201cI think Republicans are and should be the party of the 47%,\u201d he added, seeking to drive home a message about the GOP needing improve its standing with middle class voters. Things certainly grew tense when the discussion focused on foreign policy, but the men didn\u2019t deliver any blows or direct attacks against each other on stage. In fact, Cruz tried to round out the event with a glowing tribute to his soon-to-be rivals. The senator, who was elected in 2012, pointed out that both Rubio and Paul mounted long-shot Senate bids in 2010 and won despite facing establishment money and resources. \u201cAll of the money in their state was against them, and they ran campaigns that inspired me, inspired me to run,\u201d said Cruz, who also won an underdog campaign. Instead, knowing it\u2019s never a bad idea for Republicans to attack the media, they directed any confrontational tones towards Karl for trying to get the men to give \u201cyes or no\u201d answers. \u201cWhen and if any of these people run for president, there should be an absolute rule: no \u2018yes or no\u2019 questions,\u201d Paul said to the moderator, drawing applause from the audience and getting a \u201chere, here\u201d from one of his colleagues on stage.",

            "article_content": "Some Republicans mulling White House runs will have to defend struggling economies in their states Chris Christie in New Jersey and Bobby Jindal in Louisiana both have deficits to explain Republicans who want to make a play for the White House by positioning theirs as the party that can govern, in contrast to hapless Democrats, could face a significant obstacle: their governors. From New Jersey to Wisconsin to Louisiana, GOP governors with their eyes on the White House have presided over unbalanced budgets, unfunded pension liabilities, credit downgrades and sluggish job growth. That comes in contrast to an increasingly rosy economic picture nationally, with a strong December jobs report that capped off the best year in terms of economic growth for the nation since 1999. Unemployment, at 5.8 percent, was below predictions, and job growth has continued for month after month. Three of the most prominent potential 2016 contenders \u2014 New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker and Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal \u2014 could face the most scrutiny, and have the toughest time explaining, their economic records for 2016. It\u2019s a troubling prospect for the party as it prepares to offer Republicans as the \u201cparty of solutions\u201d in contrast to the Democrats, which it says has offered ineffective policies that contributed to a slow recovery and increasing inequality in the nation. Charlie Black, who chaired Sen. John McCain\u2019s 2008 presidential run, said that \u201cthe biggest problem the Democrats will have in the next election is that the economy is bad.\u201d RELATED: Kansas tax cuts on trial amid huge budget deficit \u201cIt\u2019s really lack of jobs and lack of economic progress that\u2019s the biggest issue,\u201d he said. But reality of late hasn\u2019t borne that argument out. And he admitted that some governors may have some explaining to do. Is Chris Christie too authentic? \u201cIf you\u2019re John Kasich, you have a good story to tell \u2014 but some of the others might have a little bit more difficult story to tell. But you can always come up with the right spin on it if you work on it,\u201d he said. Who will have to spin the most? Establishment Republican operatives are already quietly whispering over the elephant in the room for New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie \u2014 his state\u2019s economic woes. Christie came into office pledging replenish the state\u2019s pension program, but had to reverse that promise to help balance the state\u2019s budget. Pension liabilities have subsequently ballooned under his watch, topping $83 billion, according to the last report from debt ratings agency Moody\u2019s. Coupled with other budgetary shortfalls, the pension liabilities have resulted in Moody\u2019s and other agencies downgrading New Jersey\u2019s credit rating eight times \u2014 a record for a sitting governor of the state, according to the Star-Ledger. He also faces sluggish job growth.\u00a0New Jersey\u2019s job growth has been slower than the national average, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, and the state\u2019s unemployment rate has been higher than the national average over the past year. For his part, Christie and his supporters are aggressively fighting back against the narrative that New Jersey\u2019s economy is sliding. During Tuesday\u2019s state of the state speech, the governor outlined his \u201cFive In Five\u201d record, a laundry list of mostly economic accomplishments Christie trumpets as a sign of good Republican management of the state\u2019s pocket book. Who's in the mix for 2016 Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal is taking flak from both his right and his left, with critics saying at turns that he\u2019s cut too much government funding and too little. His latest budget has seen some of the steepest cuts to higher education ever proposed for the state \u2014 so steep, in fact, the Republican speaker of the Louisiana House has vowed to block block them, telling a local outlet the cuts \u201cwould set us back generations.\u201d Jindal and his allies, however, say they\u2019ve needed to enact steep cuts to balance the state\u2019s budget. But even conservatives are dissatisfied, noting that to achieve a balanced budget, the governor has had to rely heavily on a non-replenishable pool of \u201conetime\u201d funds that won\u2019t be available next year. \u201cIt\u2019s frustrated many of us because it does go against what we typically say, and that is, we should not spend more money that\u2019s coming in,\u201d Louisiana state Rep. Brett Geyman, a fiscally conservative Republican, said of Jindal\u2019s budgets in an interview. \u201cWe face a very large shortfall as we go into the spring session of 2015 because we\u2019ve been relying too much on those onetime funds for recurring expenses.\u201d Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker may also have to face scrutiny of a record that oversaw slower than national average job and wage growth, according to an analysis from PolitiFact. His office pushed back on the analysis, noting that the current 5.2 unemployment rate for the state is down from 7.8 when Walker came into office. Democrats also point to the fact that job growth was uneven across low, middle and high-wage sectors \u2014 with middle-wage jobs, key to the stability of the middle class, declining during the recession, according to an analysis from University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee professor Marc Levine \u2014\u00a0as evidence Walker hasn\u2019t done enough for the middle class. And the state faces a $2.2 billion budget deficit heading into the new year. A Walker aide said, however, that\u2019s a flawed prediction based on preliminary budget proposals, and that Walker will balance the final budget. \u201cWe will fund priorities and provide necessary services at a good value to taxpayers,\u201d said spokeswoman Laurel Patrick. And Walker himself sought to paint a rosy picture of his state\u2019s fiscal health during his State of the State speech Tuesday night. \u201cWe finished each year with a surplus, and we will again this year,\u201d Walker said. \u201cWisconsin\u2019s pension system is the only one fully funded in the country. The state\u2019s pension and debt ratio is one of the best. Our bond rating is positive. And the rainy day fund is the largest in state history \u2014 165 times bigger than when we first took office.\u201d Ted Strickland, president of the progressive Center for American Progress Action Fund and a former governor of Ohio, said he believes once the public begins \u201clooking below the surface\u201d of their records, \u201cyou\u2019ll find there\u2019s a lot of smoke and mirrors going on with the claims they\u2019re making.\u201d \u201cIn my judgment, they are so tied to an extreme ideology that they don\u2019t want to be confronted by the facts and the truth about what their approach, their trickle-down approach leads to: Greater deficits, a weaker economy, and greater inequality,\u201d he said. But Jindal, Christie and Walker all have accomplishments to tout as well. Christie has had to deal with a Democratic legislature that\u2019s often worked to block his legislative priorities; Louisiana has become more business-friendly under Jindal\u2019s watch, according to a number of nonpartisan rankings; and Walker\u2019s union-breaking efforts were lauded as a model for other states nationwide. But strategists say they won\u2019t be able to run from the blemishes on their records. Ryan Williams, a spokesman for Mitt Romney\u2019s 2012 bid, said that every bit of the GOP presidential contender\u2019s record as governor of Massachusetts became susceptible to scrutiny when he ran. \u201cIt\u2019s all fair game for your opposition \u2014\u00a0given that you are the executive of your state,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you\u2019re a governor running for president \u2014 you have to own whatever the pluses and minuses are for your state\u2019s economic record,\u201d he said. Some GOP governors have better records than others. Texas Gov. Rick Perry, who\u2019s contemplating another presidential run, travelled to other states, touting the Texas economy and trying to woo businesses with low tax rates. He could make his state\u2019s  economy a key pillar of a 2016 campaign. And some states governed by Democrats, like Illinois, have seen their share of economic struggles. But Democrats are hoping to make even some of those governors that aren\u2019t running a problem for Republicans. They\u2019ve pointed to Kansas Gov. Sam Brownback, whose promised conservative \u201cexperiment\u201d of implementing steep tax and spending cuts has crippled the state\u2019s economy, as evidence the conservative vision of governance doesn\u2019t work. Strickland decried what he called an \u201cexaggerated pursuit of the trickle-down agenda,\u201d in Kansas, \u201cwhere taxes were cut for the wealthy and the economy is in shambles.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s an example, I think, of what Republicans are capable of doing if they were to win the presidency,\u201d he said. Some Republicans believe Brownback\u2019s labors will eventually bear fruit. Grover Norquist, president of the conservative anti-tax group Americans for Tax Reform, lauded Brownback\u2019s move and said he should jump in the race for 2016. \u201cThere isn\u2019t a problem in front of Sam Brownback and the Republicans in Kansas that they can\u2019t fix,\u201d he said. \u201cI think he should run for president \u2014\u00a0he\u2019s radical, different, unexpected.\u201d But there\u2019s a growing chorus of voices within the GOP calling for a more moderate economic vision going forward. Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder has expressed an openness to a new gas tax, while Gov. John Kasich has floated a tax on oil and gas companies to pay for an income tax cut. It\u2019s that tension \u2014\u00a0between the moderate economic visions of purple-state governors and those of their red-state brothers \u2014 that could cause further complications for the GOP in a presidential primary fight, where they\u2019ll have to debate the benefits of both approaches on a national stage. Stan Veuger, an economist at the conservative American Enterprise Institute, said in an interview that \u201cDemocrats have some totally reasonable points\u201d on the economy. \u201cIt\u2019s not the case that if you cut tax rates, revenue is going to go up immediately,\u201d he noted, calling such a suggestion \u201cludicrous.\u201d He suggested the best solution for Republican governors was to take the middle road \u2014 and perhaps use Brownback as a cautionary tale. A Republican governor with a struggling state economy could say, \u201cI\u2019m a solid conservative governor with an eye to the deficit and the debt, but I\u2019m not going to take crazy stances in any direction,\u201d Veuger proposed.

            "article_content": "NEW: Boehner opponents face fallout House votes to give Boehner another term as Speaker GOP opposition to Boehner doubled from 2013 John Boehner was elected to a third term as Speaker of the House of Representatives on Tuesday after a tense floor vote that saw a remarkably large chunk of his own party attempt to remove him. Opposition to Boehner doubled from the last election for Speaker in 2013, when a dozen Republicans voted against him. He ultimately received 216 votes, enough to fend off an embarrassing vote on a second ballot but plenty to reinforce the notion that Boehner is struggling to maintain control over restive House Republicans. The dramatic scene played out before live television cameras, as members were called upon one-by-one to stand and name who they were backing to serve as the next Speaker. Despite the opposition facing him, Boehner was greeted by a standing ovation after he was nominated by Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers on Tuesday and his wife, Debbie, watched the floor action from the Speaker\u2019s box. Shortly after winning his spot Tuesday afternoon, an emotional Boehner called improving the economy and creating more opportunities for the middle class \u201cour vital task.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ll begin on common ground,\u201d Boehner said, adding later \u201cAll I ask is that we disagree without being disagreeable.\u201d He joked that his door is always open, but \u201cdon\u2019t get carried away with it.\u201d Behind the scenes, Republicans who opposed Boehner are beginning to face the fallout. Florida Reps. Richard Nugent, who voted against Boehner, and Daniel Webster, who challenged him, were removed from the House Rules Committee on Tuesday, according to multiple sources. Rules Committee Chairman Pete Sessions suggested the decision to remove the two GOP members came from Boehner, telling reporters he had only spoken with Webster. \u201cThe committee works at the behest of the speaker and the speaker \u2013 I believe any speaker \u2013 would want and need a person focused on that agenda,\u201d Sessions said. Sessions said he was surprised these members broke with Boehner, adding \u201csometimes there are casualties and there are changes, and people make decisions to do things knowing sometimes there can be consequences.\u201d But the Texas Republican appeared irked at the pressure from the grassroots activists these Boehner opponents drummed up before the vote. \u201cThe onslaught that has happened over the last two or three days has taken a number of members by storm. Their district offices, their Capitol Hill offices have been inundated by people who seemingly drew conclusions that we didn\u2019t even have time to go home and defend,\u201d Sessions said. A senior House GOP leadership aide indicated other members could also face some type of repercussions for their public rebuke of Boehner. Rep. Tim Huelskamp of Kansas said he and other Republicans who voted against Boehner fear some type of retribution. He said he was told by a committee chair recently that he was in line for a subcommittee chair post but then after he publicly announced his new post it was revoked, and he suggested his criticism of the leadership cost him the job. Florida Rep. Ted Yoho, who was nominated by a GOP colleague to replace Boehner and voted for himself, struck a more conciliatory note. He told reporters Boehner is \u201cthe speaker of the House and I look forward to following his lead.\u201d Boehner begins the 114th Congress with a new Republican controlled Senate and big plans to enact a conservative agenda. President Barack Obama will meet with congressional leadership next week. But the contentious election just to secure Boehner\u2019s job is a sign that the same dynamic he\u2019s seen in the last four years \u2013 resistance from conservatives \u2013 will continue to hamper his ability to govern the House. After the vote, one of the Republicans who voted against Boehner, Huelskamp said the vote re-electing Boehner \u201csends a clear message that that  U.S. House Republican majority is status quo \u2013 more of the same.\u201d He said the 25 members who voted for someone else or declined to vote was less about Boehner personally, but about his leadership\u2019s record of bringing major legislation to the House without enough input from members. Sessions, a Boehner ally who will help set floor debate parameters, said \u201cthat\u2019s not the plan\u201d and insisted there would be open deliberations with members about what bills go to  the floor. Oklahoma Republican Rep. Tom Cole, a defender of Boehner\u2019s, said that because of the larger GOP majority in the House, the speaker can afford to lose some members. And he suggested those who broke with Boehner are likely to continue resisting his legislative strategy going forward. But he warned those who regularly rebel may end up hurting their own cause. \u201cThere\u2019s always a little bit of fragmentation that occurs because again, people know they can go their own way and you can still get the legislation passed. And I think you saw a certain amount of that today. \u2018Well the speaker\u2019s going to win anyway, and this will help me at home with my right wing.  The problem is, if that\u2019s your reasoning, you\u2019re going to be subjected to that every single time, and you\u2019re going to start to lose influence,\u201d Cole said. The speaker began reaching out to members the day after the midterm elections, and he and his allies continued to make calls and appeals for support right up until the vote on Tuesday afternoon, according to a senior House GOP leadership aide.  As the top fundraiser for his party he raised over $100 million for GOP members and candidates and traveled to more than 150 events over the 2014 midterm cycle. One of the GOP members who broke with Boehner, North Carolina Rep Walter Jones, argued the current political system helps keep leaders like Boehner in place because they help colleagues with campaign donations. \u201cThis place, it\u2019s all about money. Both parties, everything is about raising money for the next election. That\u2019s what complicates good policy \u2013 is the next election and raising money,\u201d Jones said. Sessions said the new Republican majority on Capitol Hill has to have a better PR effort to ensure the public gives it credit \u2013 both with its own members and the public \u2013 for what it is doing to cut spending. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to do a very good job and sell what we do and if we sell what we do, then people will see it and i believe come to our side, including our friends in the tea party who very very much want to see our party win the presidency,\u201d Sessions said. Freshman Republican Rep Lee Zeldin, who backed Boehner, told CNN it was time for the House GOP members to move on and start focusing on coordinating with the new Republican controlled Senate. \u201cIt\u2019s important this this entire Republican conference regardless  of whether you are leadership or rank and file, whether you are conservative or moderate, or whether you are from New York or from Oklahoma that we work together to move American forward.\u201d The No. 2 House Democrat, Rep. Steny Hoyer of Maryland, told CNN he didn\u2019t think there would be any real fallout for Boehner of the high-profile spat on the House floor. \u201cHe won,\u201d Hoyer said. \u201cIn two weeks no one will remember what the vote was. He\u2019s the speaker.\u201d CNN\u2019s Dana Bash contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Hillary Clinton has had many highs and lows when it comes to gender politics She talks about female empowerment more now as she considers a 2016 run Gender \u2013 the issue that Hillary Clinton struggled to find her balance on during her 2008 campaign \u2013 is front and center as she prepares for a possible 2016 presidential run. It is, in many ways, a remarkable evolution for a female politician once bedeviled by gender politics to the self-defined \u201cpantsuit aficionado and glass ceiling cracker\u201d of today. For much of this year, Clinton has spoken with ease \u2013 and little controversy \u2013 about female empowerment. At Tina Brown\u2019s \u2018Women in the World\u2019 conference in April, Clinton declared that the \u201cdouble standard\u201d for women was \u201calive and well.\u201d In countless public appearances, she has opened up about how that standard played out in her own career: from being underestimated by male colleagues as a young lawyer to the advice given to career women her age that they should keep family pictures off their desks. The former Secretary of State has turned scrutiny about her scrunchies, headbands and hairstyles into laugh lines. She has poked fun at the sexist slights of foreign leaders\u2014like that of Bulgarian Prime Minister Boyko Borisov, who told her he was briefed that she only wore her hair back when she was in a \u201cbad mood.\u201d She often advises young women to handle criticism by developing skin \u201cas tough as a rhinoceros.\u201d And she rarely gave a speech this fall without reminding audiences she was soon to be a grandmother. The tableau was complete when she tweeted a softly lit image of her cradling newborn Charlotte while Bill Clinton beamed over her shoulder. READ: Hillary Clinton: Ban torture The careful choreography illustrates the attention her team is giving to reconnecting Clinton with Democratic women, a core constituency that Barack Obama was able to slice into during her first presidential run in 2008. The renewed courtship essentially began with her concession speech in 2008 when she told supporters that although they hadn\u2019t \u201cshattered that highest, hardest glass ceiling,\u201d it had \u201cabout 18 million cracks in it.\u201d \u201cShould she run, she has an opportunity to continue to build on what (Barack Obama) has done, and another fantastic step on that ladder is the possibility of the first woman president of the United States,\u201d said Tracy Sefl, who advised the Clinton campaign on communications strategy in 2008. \u201cThe possibility of a woman president is a welcome one, more so than is a foreign one.\u201d Now, Clinton allies encouraging her to run see an opportunity for her not only to hold the Obama coalition, but to improve on his 2012 showing among women, which would spell trouble for her Republican opponent in 2016. The President led among women by about 11 points in both 2008 and 2012. But some 56% of white women\u2014which were a strong demographic for Clinton\u2014favored 2012 Republican nominee Mitt Romney, compared to 42% for Obama in 2012. Obama also lost married women to Romney by 7 points. This year\u2019s effort to put gender front and center is a nod to those numbers.  It also reflects a politician who, after more than two decades in the public eye, is more comfortable sharing her personal experiences with voters. Another asset is that Obama\u2019s historic election \u2013 along with Clinton\u2019s competitive bid in 2008 \u2013 changed societal expectations of what an American President must look like. In interviews during this year\u2019s midterm elections, many Democratic voters, particularly women, said they feel it is her turn for a historic victory. Though Clinton has not defined her 2016 message, her speeches this year have hinted a partial framework for her candidacy: her argument that the \u2018women\u2019s issues\u2019 she has championed \u2013 pay equity, family leave, raising the minimum wage, access to childcare \u2013 are really \u201cfamily issues\u201d that are part of her life\u2019s work \u2013 and that of her husband \u2013 to boost the middle class. \u201cWith women\u201d in the next election cycle, Center for American Progress President Neera Tanden said, \u201cthe opportunity is to connect up these economic issues that they see as time challenges for them\u2014like paid leave, or sick days or childcare\u2014to a broader economic message.\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t think of anyone who would be better at doing that than Hillary Clinton,\u201d said Tanden, who advised Clinton on policy as first lady, senator from New York and during her presidential campaign. Clinton is still a cautious speaker. But when it comes to connecting with other women through her own story, she seems more comfortable in her own skin than she did even a few years ago. It is an open question, however, whether independent voters and moderate Republican women will embrace the issues she seems most inclined to talk about in 2016. \u201cHer natural focus is that she wants to be seen as this person who is a champion for women. It remains to be seen whether that\u2019s a particularly successful general election strategy,\u201d said Katie Packer Gage, whose firm Burning Glass coaches Republican candidates on connecting with female voters. \u201cWomen just don\u2019t have history of voting for women; they have a pretty decent history of following their party behavior. So being a woman doesn\u2019t necessarily provide some kind of big advantage.\u201d As Democratic Sen. Mark Udall\u2019s failed re-election campaign in Colorado this year showed, strategies that are too rooted in gender can backfire. But Democratic pollster Celinda Lake said that during the 2008 recession male voters became more attuned and receptive to the economic issues that disproportionately affect women, like raising the minimum wage and pay equity. \u201cWhat happened in this recession was that men lost their jobs before women did,\u201d said Lake, who oversaw focus group research for the Clinton campaign in 1992 and served as a consultant to the campaign. \u201cIn lots and lots of families, you had the woman at some point as the primary, and maybe the only, breadwinner in the family. So this last recession really changed things.\u201d READ: George W. Bush picks Jeb over \u2018sister-in-law\u2019 Hillary Over her long career, Clinton\u2019s remarks about women\u2019s personal and career choices have often shaped the peaks and valleys of her popularity. She was shadowed during her husband\u2019s 1992 campaign by his suggestion that American voters could \u201cbuy one, get one free.\u201d That notion quickly became a liability as Hillary Clinton\u2019s work as opponents scrutinized her work as a lawyer in the Rose Law Firm while he was governor of Arkansas, as well as her outspoken demeanor. Fed up with what she considered \u201cspurious\u201d charges about her business dealings in March of 1992, Clinton delivered the disastrous retort that she \u201ccould have stayed home and baked cookies and had teas.\u201d When strung together with her earlier defense of her husband from charges of infidelity\u2014\u201dI\u2019m not sitting here, some little woman standing by my man like Tammy Wynette\u201d\u2014she became a sharply polarizing figure among women. \u201cCritics were venomous,\u201d she recalled in her first memoir, Living History. \u201cI was called a Rorschach test for the American public, and it was an apt way of conveying the varied and extreme reactions that I provoked.\u201d Even by the summer of that 1992 campaign, she noted, most Americans did not realize that she had a child. She relented to a joint People magazine interview where the couple described 12-year-old Chelsea, who appeared with them on the cover, as the center of their lives. \u201cFriends of the Clintons say that the public labeling of Hillary as an ambitious careerist misses her warmth and playfulness,\u201d one notable line from the \u2018People\u2019 profile said. Both Clintons defended her tea and cookies comment as misunderstanding. \u201cIt gave a totally false impression of who she is,\u201d her husband told the magazine, insisting that she had not been \u201cmuzzled\u201d after the controversy. Improving the First Lady\u2019s image among women and presenting her in a more \u201clikeable light\u201d became a preoccupation for the White House staff, as 1990s documents released by the National Archives this year reveal. She regained some of her footing at a 1995 women\u2019s conference in Beijing where she said that \u201chuman rights are women\u2019s rights, and women\u2019s rights are human rights.\u201d  In another sign of how the female-centered message will coincide with her campaign, the Clinton Foundation plans to release a report tracking women\u2019s progress since her 1995 speech this spring. But as late as 1999 before her Senate run, she was still being advised by strategist Mandy Grunwald to try to show \u201cmore sides\u201d of herself and look for \u201copportunities for humor\u201d to avoiding coming off as so stern. \u201cThe only two (female) candidates I can think of over time who were really perceived as being too tough are Dianne Feinstein and Hillary Clinton,\u201d said Dianne Bystrom, who has studied female politicians since the 1990s at Iowa State\u2019s Carrie Chapman Catt Center for Women and Politics. That liability surfaced for Clinton most notably in 2008. She spoke early on about trying to break the glass ceiling of the presidency. But her campaign ultimately centered on the message that she was the only candidate with the strength and experience to lead. When she was asked what it meant to be a woman running as president, her answer was always that she was proud to be a woman making that attempt, but she was running because she thought she\u2019d be the \u201cbest president.\u201d Not long before her third place finish in the Iowa caucuses, Bystrom recalled, Hawkeye state polls indicated that voters perceived her as tougher than Obama, but less caring. Soon the campaign had launched a website full of soft testimonials from friends and admirers about the \u201cHillary I know,\u201d and cut ads featuring Clinton and her mother laughing in the kitchen. OPINION: Bush & Clinton: Do they have what it takes? She won the New Hampshire primary a day after startling voters by becoming emotional when asked how she was handling the pressure of the campaign. \u201cIt\u2019s not easy,\u201d she said as her eyes filled with tears before a group of undecided women at a Portsmouth, New Hampshire, diner. Her campaign arranged other female-focused events in the long duel with Obama that followed, but that New Hampshire meeting would mark a rare moment of vulnerability for a candidate who was profiled in \u2018The New Yorker\u2019 in March 2008 as \u201cThe Irony Lady.\u201d Clinton had soon swerved back to framing herself as \u201csomeone tested and ready to lead in a dangerous world,\u201d as one of her ads said\u2014the person voters would want answering the phone at the White House at 3 a.m.. Looking ahead to 2016, Clinton seems unlikely to face the hurdle of a competitive primary, much less a battle over historic firsts. And after four years as Secretary of State\u2014which tabled the experience question for many voters, according to polls\u2014Clinton may feel that she simply has more latitude to talk about her life experiences in a more personal way than in previous campaigns. \u201cShe has more freedom, because she has more political accomplishments than she did when she ran in 2008,\u201d said Jennifer Lawless, director of the Women & Politics Institute at American University.  At the same time, \u201call of the Monday morning quarterbacking suggests that it was probably a mistake that (the 2008 Clinton campaign) took the women\u2019s vote at all different generation levels for granted.\u201d Primary or not, Clinton and her team seem determined not to make that mistake again.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Hugh Hewitt is a lawyer, law professor, author and host of a nationally syndicated radio show. He served in the Reagan administration in posts including assistant counsel in the White House and special assistant to two attorneys general. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his. Hugh Hewitt: Strong GOP debate adds to concerns the leading Democrat should have about questions on her record as secretary of state He says a number of candidates displayed strong skills and tried out arguments vs. Clinton Which Republican does former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton fear the most at this moment \u2013 after four GOP debates, with her own nomination nearly secure, but with troubling developments surrounding her own general election prospects? Last night\u2019s debate added to her growing pile of worries. It was a very good night for the GOP, and a very bad one for her.  And it came after a string of setbacks for Clinton \u2013 setbacks large and small, obvious and hidden. Just in the last week, a copy of her signed, 15-paragraph \u201cSensitive Compartmented Information Non-Disclosure Agreement,\u201d executed on January 22, 2009 surfaced in The Washington Free Beacon courtesy of Lachlan Markay. This signed NDA removes any doubt that Mrs. Clinton was briefed and agreed to protocols concerning the highest classification materials, including the absolute duty to protect their integrity and to leave them all in the government\u2019s custody upon retirement. Also in the last week, in a Reuters story by Jonathan Allen, came the news that the global consulting firm Teneo, a company  with extensive and murky ties to all things Clinton, refused to answer most questions from the Senate Judiciary Committee about those ties and the doors they may have opened. Less than two weeks ago, Clinton stumbled badly when she downplayed the scandal at the Veterans Administration to Rachel Maddow, dismissing it as \u201cnot as widespread\u201d as critics had made it out to be for political reasons \u2013 a tin-eared obliviousness obvious even to her supporters still cheering her appearance before the Benghazi committee. (An appearance that \u2013 for all of the sighs of relief it elicited from Clinton-world \u2013 exposed her deep dishonesty about the non-role of a video critical of Islam in the attack on the U.S. consulate in Benghazi on September 11, 2012.) So the former secretary of state watched two debates Tuesday night that (1) previewed in small bits the attacks which will grow unrelenting as the 2016 election draws closer, (2) featured a chilling commercial for the sure-to-be-damning-for-her movie \u201c13 Hours\u201d about the Benghazi terrorist attack and (3) showcased the rhetorical skills of a quartet of would-be nominees \u2013 Chris Christie, Ted Cruz, Carly Fiorina and Marco Rubio \u2013 that are undeniably superior to hers.  She has plenty to fear from many in the GOP field, but debates with those four have got to top her list of nightmares. (Which is why, in my book of advice for her, \u201cThe Queen,\u201d I advise her to simply refuse general election debates, as Richard Nixon did in 1972, and to adopt contemptuous language in doing so.) Is GOP reality show over? None of the Republican nominees are less appealing than Mrs. Clinton, especially when Fiorina\u2019s scathing, scalding reminder of \u201cthe Clinton way\u201d is fresh in the memory. Carly foreshadowed a line of attack that the GOP nominee \u2013 whomever he or she turns out to be \u2013 will use, one that pounds on Mrs. Clinton\u2019s untrustworthiness, her family\u2019s wealth and the means by which it was gained, and her catastrophic tenure at the State Department. Hillary has to be worried about some combination of those four candidates facing her next fall, but worried as well that Donald Trump and Dr. Ben Carson are drawing huge audiences to the GOP debates and new voters to the GOP registration desk. She has to be worried that even the very liberal Larry David, in his \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d appearance last weekend, joined in the mockery of the idea of Donald Trump being a racist, and that the media overkill on Ben Carson\u2019s biographical detail solidified an already nearly 100% suspicion that the public believes that media is in her corner, has a collective finger on the scale.  She has to be worried that the public thinks the media is in the tank for her because they, like she, are part of the privileged America for whom the economic times are never rough and the landings are always soft. She has to be worried that the unrelenting attacks on the police and the odd sequence of campus controversies are creating within middle class America a puzzlement-bordering-on-panic that the country is careening out of control under the President she wants to succeed with the promise of a third Obama term. Hillary is every Republican\u2019s target, thought by many rank-and-file average Americans to be protected by the media, and a dreadful candidate 25 years or more older than some of her possible competitors.  With fewer people on the GOP stage, freed from the anchor of the antagonistic moderators of the third debate, the GOP\u2019s \u201celite eight\u201d mostly excelled at making their points and their cases. Debate coach: Trump wants 'Operation Wetback'? As the field narrows but does not collapse, Hillary\u2019s woes will increase. She cannot train all her financial firepower on a nominee she can\u2019t identify, even as she must keep shuffling left to stay within an arm\u2019s reach of the avowed socialist from Vermont, as the GOP collectively sharpens its focus and its skills. Last night was a first real glimpse of the skills gap that will haunt the former first lady in the fall. Her party\u2019s bench is decimated; the GOP bench is full. For every alleged downside to every Republican candidate, there is an upside argument. And there is that word that Donald Trump introduced into the campaign and which continues to shape and define it: energy.  Many of the Republican candidates had it at various moments last night.  And just those few glimpses, combined with the dreadful realities of the world Hillary helped make and the fears fanned by the forces she helped the President to unleash, means she must have spent a troubled night. But mostly that trailer for that movie. It is haunting. Damning. And it will not go away, much as she wishes it would.  Neither will her NDA. Neither will the questions unanswered by Teneo.

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Donald L. Fowler, who served as the Democratic National Committee Chair from 1995 to 1997, is a political science professor at the University of South Carolina and founder of Fowler Communications. Fowler is supporting Hillary Clinton in the 2016 presidential nomination contest. He is a current Democratic National Committee member and a member of the Rules and Bylaws Committee. The opinion expressed in this commentary are his. Former DNC chair says the debate plan will give candidates enough time to show their strengths, have a robust exchange In past cycles, the number of debates was too large, bogging down the candidates and hurting their chances, he says Five months before the Iowa Caucus, and nearly 15 months before Election Day, excitement for the 2016 election is building among Democratic activists. I\u2019m not sure we could have imagined better motivation than seeing Donald Trump sitting atop the Republican polls, trailed by the prospect of yet another President Bush. It seems to have been the kick in the pants Democrats needed to get off the couch and get to work defending the considerable achievements of President Obama\u2019s time in office, especially considering the party\u2019s lackluster performance during the 2014 midterms. At the moment, that excitement has manifested as concern over the rules governing how the Democratic Party will choose our next presidential nominee. We need to ensure that we nominate a candidate who is prepared for the rigors of a campaign, not to mention holding the highest office in the land. Thankfully, I see five such qualified candidates on the Democratic side, and potentially a few more, while I\u2019ve yet to see one among the 15 or 20 Republicans vying for their nomination. So while I understand the concerns that some Democrats have expressed concerning the debate schedule, I wholeheartedly agree with the schedule as currently structured. This schedule is best for our candidates, our supporters, and for voters. Most importantly, I believe that it puts Democrats in the best possible position to win in November 2016 with a tested nominee, operating from a position of strength. As a former DNC chair, I\u2019m familiar with the guiding principles that are taken into consideration when creating a debate schedule. The goal is to set a reasonable number of debates that maximizes voters\u2019 opportunity to see the candidates side by side, while remaining manageable for all of the participants. To be clear, I haven\u2019t always seen the Democratic Party do this. Since my time as chair, several cycles have turned into unruly and out-of-control situations more hurtful than beneficial to our party. Six debates provide multiple opportunities for voters to hear our candidates share their visions for our country\u2019s future. They also provide multiple opportunities for our candidates to engage in a rigorous discussion. But this discussion occurs not only with each other, but also with the American people. A pace of one debate per month gives candidates plenty of opportunities to engage voters at rallies, town halls, house meetings, forums, and other campaign events. At DNC meeting, Martin O'Malley slams Democrats over debates Voters need opportunities to hear the policy positions of our candidates without the constraints of a clock or the artificial limitations of a debate stage. Nobody wants our candidates focused solely on debates and debate prep at the exclusion of chances to interact directly with voters. Another consideration is the importance of holding debates when voters are actually paying attention. Did you know that the first Republican primary debate of the 2012 election was in May 2011? Unless you\u2019re Tim Pawlenty or Gary Johnson (who participated in the debate, unlike Mitt Romney), you probably don\u2019t remember it. Fall of 2015 was always the ideal window to begin the debate schedule, and October 13 fits squarely into this principle. And with each of the six sanctioned debates sponsored by a combination of state Democratic Parties, national media, digital platforms, local media, and civic organizations, these debates will be appealing and accessible to voters. These debates will reflect our party\u2019s \u2013 and our country\u2019s \u2013 diversity. They will include the first ever party-sanctioned Univision debate, especially important to our Hispanic citizens. Debate negotiations rarely lead to all sides getting exactly what they want \u2013 that\u2019s why they\u2019re called negotiations. But this is a schedule that meets the fundamental principles that guided the process and will benefit the Democratic Party. What is the debate schedule? Six DNC-sanctioned debates are in line with the precedent set during the 2004 and 2008 election cycles. You probably recall a seemingly endless series of debates,  including many non-DNC sanctioned ones, in those years, which I think has contributed to the confusion surrounding this year\u2019s schedule. Who's running for President? In fact, the reason the DNC is enforcing an \u201cexclusivity requirement,\u201d where candidates are barred from participating in non-DNC sanctioned debates under penalty of losing their access to the sanctioned and nationally televised debates, this cycle is so that we can avoid a repeat of what happened in cycles past. In both 2004 and 2008, a lack of enforcement led to more than 20 debates. This confused voters and overwhelmed our candidates, and was an experience no one had any interest in repeating. As much as I love politics, even I don\u2019t really want to watch 20 Democratic and 20 Republican primary debates between now and March. Limiting the number should make it likely that more viewers will watch, and help our message break through. It\u2019s worth noting that in recent election cycles, the general election has featured three debates between the parties\u2019 presidential nominees and one contest between the potential vice presidents. No one contends that three or four debates are insufficient for voters to distinguish the differences between the candidates. It is understood that the majority of campaigning will be conducted outside the debate arena, among the other events and opportunities for candidates to interact with and engage voters. This schedule enhances our candidates\u2019 ability to do that. During the DNC\u2019s Summer Meeting, one of our outstanding candidates, Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley reminded us that we as Democrats cannot remain silent in the face of Republican lies, Republican misogyny, Republican distortions about our President, and Republican disdain for our neighbors. He was absolutely right. But I hope that Democrats aren\u2019t waiting for a debate stage or a convention or a presidential nominee to speak up. Because all of us have a responsibility, each and every day, through our words and our actions, to show the American people that it is the Democratic Party that is on their side, championing their well-being. I\u2019m proud that our presidential candidates have spoken up to call out hateful rhetoric from Donald Trump and Jeb Bush and Scott Walker, and to hold Republicans accountable for their outdated and out-of-touch policies. And I\u2019m proud that our party leaders, elected officials, activists, supporters, and volunteers have done the same. I expect that each of them will continue to remind people what it means to be a Democrat, using every platform they have to keep fighting for middle-class families. That\u2019s why I\u2019m encouraged by the debate over the debates. It\u2019s an indication that Democrats are engaged in the political process, moving past the complacency that plagued us in 2010 and 2014. The current schedule was structured to put the Democratic nominee, whoever it eventually is, in the best position to win next November. I expect that our candidates will participate in the DNC-sanctioned debates, and capitalize on the numerous other opportunities that exist to interact with voters on the campaign trail. And Democratic activists will channel their energy into what we do best: knocking on doors, making phone calls, registering and educating new voters, and relying on the strength of our grassroots supporters to win in 2016.

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Stephen Onyeiwu is Professor of Economics at Allegheny College, Pennsylvania. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. CNN is showcasing the work of The Conversation, a collaboration between journalists and academics to provide news analysis and commentary. The content is produced solely by The Conversation. Obama has invited Nigeria's President Buhari to the White House Onyeiwu: Obama turned the U.S. economy around through a vast stimulus program, rather than austerity Buhari could fund investment in key sectors via domestic borrowing It is atypical for an American president to invite a nascent African head of state to the White House, especially less than one month after the latter\u2019s inauguration. To some observers, therefore, U.S. President Barack Obama\u2019s invitation of his Nigerian counterpart, Muhammadu Buhari, for a White House parley scheduled for July 20 would seem to be an aberration and a surprise. But an analysis of both leaders\u2019 circumstances suggests that such a meeting is a no-brainer. Buhari and Obama were elected during a period of economic turmoil and distress. When Obama was elected in 2008 the US economy was in dire straits and reminiscent of contemporary Nigerian economy. With unemployment rate hovering around 10%, the U.S. economy was losing 800,000 jobs monthly. Budget deficits were spiraling, pushing the country\u2019s debt stock to unsustainable levels. Like Buhari, Obama not only met an empty treasury but was also saddled with a whopping debt burden of about US$10 trillion \u2013 or 72% of GDP. Both presidents also inherited expensive and drawn-out wars which they pledged to end. Ending the wars in Afghanistan and Iraq was a major mantra  in Obama\u2019s election campaigns in 2008. In Buhari\u2019s campaign a major platform was the promise to end the scourge of Boko Haram. Just as Nigerians clamored for change during the last elections, Americans desperately wanted change in 2008. When people clamor for change, they\u2019re taking a big risk. But, looking back, many Americans would say that the risk they took in 2008 was well-calculated. The U.S. economy has rebounded. Unemployment has fallen from 10% in 2009 to the current level of about 5%. The U.S. budget deficit is now less than half of what it was when Obama first took office. Obama has also significantly reduced the presence of American troops in Afghanistan and Iraq. In a sense, he has virtually fulfilled all his election promises well ahead of the end of his presidential tenure. Given the striking similarities in both leaders\u2019 circumstances, Buhari would do well to borrow Obama\u2019s economic \u201cmagic wand.\u201d If he does, he\u2019ll be surprised to learn that Obama turned the U.S. economy around not through austerity measures, but by spending more.. A few days after his election, Obama appointed Harvard economist and former Treasury secretary Larry Summers as his chief economic adviser. At the same time he announced his intention to launch an economic stimulus program at a scale never seen before in the country. Obama justified the stimulus program by referring to the severity of the economic challenges he inherited. Despite push-backs from Republicans in Congress, he managed to implement a stimulus program worth almost US$1 trillion. His strategy was predicated on the premise that the way to resuscitate the economy is not through belt-tightening, but via expansionary fiscal and monetary policies. Obama\u2019s stimulus strategy focused on \u201cshovel-ready\u201d projects that created jobs almost instantaneously, as well as on programs that delivered immediate cash to Americans. The projects and programs include infrastructure, education, health, renewable energy, tax incentives, unemployment benefits and other social welfare provisions. Shortly after Obama\u2019s inauguration, Americans began to receive stimulus cheques in their mailboxes or get temporary tax relief. As an unapologetic proponent of \u201cMiddle Class Economics\u201d \u2013 the notion that a virile middle class is a sine qua non for a robust economy \u2013 much of Obama\u2019s stimulus money went to middle-class Americans. Though Buhari has yet to formally unveil his economic blueprint, he should resist the temptation of embarking on belt-tightening as an end in itself. His administration appears to be drumming-up the need to reduce the cost of governance. While this is an unassailable proposition, he should be circumspect about what he intends to cut. In the process of cutting costs care should be taken not to jettison investments and projects needed to enhance the country\u2019s productive capacity. Buhari should consider increasing spending in sectors, projects and programs that boost the economy, generate employment and promote inclusive growth. These sectors include infrastructure, labor-intensive manufacturing, agro-processing, health and education. Nigeria is arguably a country where a massive economic stimulus programme is urgently needed. It has a large stock of human and natural resources that are grossly underutilized. The informal sector is bloated, with millions of underemployed youths. Most of Nigeria\u2019s graduates are unemployed or engaged in menial jobs. Meanwhile, there is a huge infrastructural deficit that can be partly filled through public works projects executed with direct labor. These projects would provide temporary employment to unskilled workers, enabling them to gain experience needed for permanent jobs. Buhari has the pedigree to shepherd a massive stimulus program. He\u2019s known to abhor profligacy, which means that stimulus money will be spent prudently. He detests graft and corruption, which implies that stimulus funds won\u2019t disappear. This depends on whether Buhari will be able to prevent those around him from corruptly enriching themselves \u2013 something his predecessor failed to do. Like Obama, he cares deeply for the downtrodden, which suggests he\u2019ll focus stimulus spending on job creation and economic empowerment. Some may wonder how the Buhari administration could possibly finance stimulus spending. After all, he has inherited an empty treasury and faces dwindling oil revenues and a volatile global oil market. But Nigeria could follow the example of Asian countries that financed their stimulus programs through domestic borrowing (mainly by issuing government bonds). Borrowing money domestically in one\u2019s own currency is not nearly as problematic as external borrowing. Financing stimulus spending via domestic borrowing comes with a price. It may crowd-out domestic private investment by raising interest rates. But this would be temporary. The increase in aggregate demand generated by stimulus spending would subsequently crowd-in investment in the production of goods and services. This ultimately will generate employment opportunities. One of the usual concerns about stimulus spending is the risk of inflation. But unemployment, economic disempowerment and youth restiveness are bigger threats to stability than inflation in the short to medium term. Also, given the huge slack resources in Nigeria, it is doubtful that stimulus spending would precipitate hyperinflation in the short to medium term. In any case, the Central Bank of Nigeria has the necessary monetary instruments for reigning in inflation should it become a challenge. One other lesson Buhari should learn from Obama is that it is better for a leader to stick with his or her convictions rather than let opinion polls or emotional sentiments drive their economic policies. Some pundits were dismissive and derisive of Obama\u2019s stimulus strategy when it was launched. The rest, as they say, is history. Obama stuck with his stimulus strategy and eventually prevailed. At a recent rally in Minnesota organized to showcase the good news about the U.S. economy, Obama proudly proclaimed that \u201cMiddle Class Economics does work!\u201d It remains to be seen how history will judge the Buhari presidency, and whether he will be the quintessential Obama.

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Julian Zelizer is a professor of history and public affairs at Princeton University and a New America fellow. He is the author of \u201cJimmy Carter\u201d and \u201cThe Fierce Urgency of Now: Lyndon Johnson, Congress and the Battle for the Great Society.\u201d The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. Hillary Clinton campaign holds kickoff speech Saturday, June 13, at New York City's Roosevelt Island Julian Zelizer says this is an opportunity for Clinton to better define what her campaign is all about On Saturday, June 13, Hillary Clinton delivered an important address at the Franklin D. Roosevelt Four Freedom Parks in New York to officially launch her campaign, a follow-up to her video announcing her candidacy. The speech, according to campaign officials, was deigned to laysout  \u201cher view of the challenges facing this country and her vision and ideas for moving the country.\u201d There is a lot for Clinton supporters to be excited about. Notwithstanding all the ups and downs of the first few weeks of her rollout, Clinton still looks like a strong candidate. Though there have been three primary challengers to emerge, Lincoln Chafee, Martin O\u2019Malley and Bernie Sanders, she is still largely considered to be a lock for the nomination. Her fund raising strength and her electoral support, as well as the overall package that she offers as a candidate for the Democratic Party in 2016, are formidable. Clinton still polls ahead of all the Republican candidates including Jeb Bush. Yet there is clearly unease among many Democrats. There have been stories about the fact that Sen. Sanders, who most people doubt has a chance of even winning a caucus or primary, is drawing big crowds during his speeches and is electrifying audiences. The ongoing stories in the mainstream press, stimulated by Peter Schweitzer\u2019s provocative book about the Clinton Foundation, have produced a flurry of articles questioning the Clintons\u2019 ties to corporate money. Upsetting to her supporters are a number of recent polls that have shown her favorability rating to be at or well below 50%. When asked in one survey whether voters trusted her, a whopping 57% responded that at this time they did not. Some of the underlying challenges that Hillary Clinton will have to address before the general election in the fall of 2016 are becoming very clear. Talk about any kind of crisis for her campaign is overblown, but the opportunity for correction and improvement is very real. While winning the nomination should still be relatively straightforward, Clinton should use these valuable months to effectively work through some of the negative perceptions that exist within the electorate and to fortify her position by answering, rather than evading, these concerns. Most important of all is trust. This is an issue that has dogged Hillary Clinton since she was the first lady. Will voters trust her to do what she says?  For decades, the Clintons have come under attack for the veracity of their words. Much of this, unfairly, is about her husband and not her. Bill Clinton was well known over the decades for being willing to cut a deal that undercut his allies and friends. Many Democrats felt that way in the 1990s when he agreed to eliminate the federal welfare program, AFDC, or responded to the Republican takeover of Congress in 1994 by later saying that \u201cThe Era of Big Government Is Over.\u201d Democrats felt betrayed when they learned that he lied to the public about his relationship with Monica Lewinsky, given the high risks he knew this posed for the party. The perception also stems from the intense fervor for investigation that her conservative opponents have had since the early part of Clinton\u2019s time as first lady. They have mounted an aggressive push to undermine her credibility with charges of lying  and scandal. As a political candidate, Hillary Clinton herself has continually struggled to overcome this image. The debate in the 2008 primaries about her record on Iraq grew out of these concerns as much as it did over concerns that she was too hawkish on Iraq. Democrats, for example, pounced on questions about trust after her long-winded answer in a debate explaining her position on granting driver\u2019s licenses to illegal immigrants. Now she will face this challenge again. Regardless of what is fair and what is partisan slander, Clinton has to outline what positions she stands for and make a strong case to the public about for the priorities she would pursue as president. She has to distance herself from the neoliberal economic record of her husband, and to demonstrate to voters that she comes from a very different Democratic tradition, one more closely tied to labor-based, middle-class economics attuned to the need for government to help mitigate social inequality and economic downturns. There needs to be more New Deal, and less DLC (the centrist organization her husband helped create). Given that recent polls show Americans are greatly concerned about inequality of wealth and income, considering it to be a major issue, the political value of taking this stand should also be clear. Chafee bashes Clinton on war, promotes metric system Hillary Clinton will also have to sort out where she stands on money and politics. Many of the stories that have been damaging to her early campaign have touched on something essential to the Clintons since the 1990s \u2013 their close relations to the world of Wall Street and campaign donors. Though there really haven\u2019t been any smoking guns showing that Hillary Clinton ever did anything wrong, the stories revealed that the couple lives in an insular world of wealthy campaign contributors. These relationships touch on a toxic element of our current political system. This is not new. The Clintons have always been very skilled and connected in this world. This has been one of their strengths as partisans. But at a moment when polls show enormous concern about the role of money and politics this can be a vulnerability, and opponents can use it to portray her as a candidate disconnected from the world of average citizens. And  Clinton will have to figure out how to position herself in relationship to the incumbent president.  This is always an enormous challenge for a candidate, ordinarily a vice president, of the same party as a second term president. Obama\u2019s record is politically complicated. For many Democrats, there is not much of a problem. The president has a robust record, they say. On domestic policy, he was able to secure passage of important domestic legislation like the Affordable Care Act that Clinton needs to defend. The worst possible strategy, they feel, is to play into the Republican criticism and accept that Obama\u2019s programs were flawed. On foreign policy, Obama\u2019s supporters feel that she should stand by the administration\u2019s record that has made diplomacy and international alliances central to conducting foreign affairs, all the while keeping much of the post-9/11 counterterrorism programs in place. But Clinton, like everyone else in the political world, realizes that President Obama\u2019s record has much baggage. Many Americans are not satisfied with his domestic record and view the domestic programs as flawed. Even a large number of progressives feel that Obama sold out his coalition and agreed to corporate-based solutions to public policy that have been flawed from the start. For conservatives, and many independents, everything about the administration has been a disaster. In their view, Obama\u2019s foreign policy has been a decision to stand still as terrorist networks expand and his domestic policies have been one flawed program after another. Hillary Clinton has not yet clearly explained how she will handle this challenge. With this speech, she begin.. She needs to figure out a way to differentiate herself from the failures and problems, without making the mistake that Vice President Al Gore did in 2000 of separating himself from the very assets that the incumbent president brings to the table. The next few months will thus be critical for Clinton, not in terms of winning or losing the nomination, but in effectively dealing with some of the underlying vulnerabilities which have become clear.  This is the time when she can do this by clarifying positions, showing voters her character more clearly and knocking down some of the questions that have emerged. If she does not, these vulnerabilities will come back to bite her in the general election as Republicans will seek to spread doubts about Clinton to win their way back into the White House.

            "article_content": "Gloria Borger: Hillary Clinton's team is doing all it can to make her appear relatable to ordinary people She asks if the most famous woman in the world can really connect with ordinary voters? It is not hard to imagine the conversations inside the Hillary Clinton camp prelaunch: How do we take the best known woman in the world and make her seem like less of a big shot? How can the people in Iowa and New Hampshire get to know the \u201creal Hillary,\u201d the Midwestern Methodist? (As a friend told me, she\u2019s someone who \u201clikes to sing \u2018God Bless America\u2019 on New Year\u2019s Eve.\u201d) And how to open the minds of people about someone everyone already has an opinion about? Same questions, no doubt, that the staff asked in 2008 when she ran against the newbie Barack Obama, and same questions they asked when, as first lady, she ran for the Senate in New York. In that race, she ended up spending a lot of all-ears quality time in upstate New York. In this race, she could be spending a lot of all-you-can-eat time at Diners, Drive-ins and Dives \u2014 just like the TV show. (Except Guy Fieri would probably have been recognized by the crowd at Chipotle. Just sayin.\u2019 ) Dining aside, it\u2019s hard \u2013 almost impossible \u2013 to soft-launch a campaign with a superstar politician.  All the gauzy ads and the small classrooms and the coffee shops can\u2019t mask the Houdini-like effort Hillary Clinton is making to escape the inescapable reality \u2013 that even her \u201cScooby-Doo\u201d van is followed by throngs of press. (I half imagined an O.J. moment with a helicopter hovering as she made her way down I-80.) Try as she might to launch with a humble start \u2014 not entitled to anything \u2014 she still is who she is. Virtually unchallenged. Not to mention famous, accomplished and controversial. In watching it all unfold, it\u2019s hard to underestimate the task at hand. It\u2019s also hard to figure out whether it\u2019s actually going to work. Hillary Clinton \u2014 and her experienced campaign team \u2014 are disciplined and relentlessly on message. That\u2019s usually a good thing when you\u2019re running a presidential campaign. But when you\u2019re sitting at a community college in Iowa and you tick off your rationale for running and your resume \u2014 unprompted \u2014 it seems less effective and more oddly incongruent. (Especially when the former secretary of state described her tenure in five words \u2014 as \u201cstanding up for our country.\u201d Short shrift, it seems to me.) All the gauzy ads and the small classrooms and the coffee shops can\u2019t mask the Houdini-like effort Hillary Clinton is making to escape the inescapable reality. Gloria Borger Hillary Clinton's career in the spotlight Maybe it\u2019s that the old lessons of message discipline don\u2019t work in the informal environment the campaign is trying to create \u2014 at least not with this candidate. The hardest combination in politics is that just-right mixture of spontaneity and discipline. The ability to understand exactly what you have to say (over and over) and then say it as if you have never said it before. And look like you\u2019re having a great time doing it. We like to call it authenticity, but it\u2019s probably not. It\u2019s a honed skill that combines connection and gravitas, both of which the voters demand in a president. (A majority of voters \u2013 53% \u2013  say they want to vote for someone who has been financially successful, as opposed to someone who has not.) So there\u2019s this balance: If you\u2019re too much like them, you\u2019re nothing special to vote for. But if you\u2019re too different, you\u2019re not relatable. It\u2019s a balance that doesn\u2019t come easily to Hillary Clinton. But she\u2019s not alone. When President George H.W. Bush was running for re-election in 1992, he was facing his own image issues. His populist challengers were calling him insensitive to middle class woes in the struggling state of New Hampshire. Bush tried mightily to drop the presidential persona, did some town halls, and famously declared:  \u201cMessage: I care.\u201d Some said he actually read it from a cue card, but he also said this: \u201cI don\u2019t know what I have to do to convince people here that I really care about this (the economy). I do.\u201d He lost. To an empathetic I-feel-your-pain Bill Clinton. And the rest, as they say, is history. Or, in Hillary\u2019s case, at least trying to make history.

And March Madness brackets are already busted. It\u2019s Friday, and here are the 5 things to know for your New Day. Congrats, but \u2026 : Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu got a congratulatory call from President Obama yesterday on his big election win, but it also came with a warning. Obama told Netanyahu that the United States would \u201creassess\u201d aspects of its relationship with Israel after Netanyahu\u2019s provocative statements leading up to Tuesday\u2019s Israeli election. The prime minister had said before the election that he no longer supported a two-state solution in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, although he walked those comments back somewhat yesterday. ISIS involved?: Yesterday ISIS said it was behind Wednesday\u2019s terror attack at a museum in Tunisia that left 23 people dead. In audio posted online, the terror group ID\u2019d a pair of men it said used \u201cautomatic weapons and hand grenades\u201d in the attack. The two attackers were also carrying explosives, Tunisia\u2019s President revealed in an interview with French media. U.S. officials think the attack was carried out by a local \u201cfranchise\u201d of ISIS, rather than being centrally directed by ISIS leadership. ISIS warns that Wednesday\u2019s bloodshed was \u201cjust the start.\u201d A grisly crime: She was simply looking to buy some clothes for her unborn child. Instead she ended up losing the fetus in a most unthinkable way. A 26-year-old woman who was seven months pregnant went to a Colorado home seeking to buy baby clothes advertised on Craigslist. The woman ended up being stabbed in the stomach and the fetus was removed. The fetus died, but the mother is expected to survive. The woman accused of the crime, a 34-year-old former nurse aide named Dynel Lane, is being held on $2 million bail. Prosecutors are still deciding whether to charge her with killing a fetus. Let\u2019s make a deal: Bipartisanship in Washington! Yes, it can happen, as it did yesterday when House Speaker John Boehner and House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi announced a plan to advance a bill to fix the reimbursement rate for Medicare physicians. The bill would replace the Medicare Sustainable Growth Rate with a new payment system as well as other options to streamline how Medicare doctors are paid. A vote is expected on the House floor next week. Bracket busters: If you\u2019re telling people today you picked Georgia State or the University of Alabama at Birmingham to win their NCAA basketball tournament games, you\u2019re probably a liar. Those two teams, both 14 seeds, busted pretty much every bracket in the country with their upset victories yesterday afternoon. And Georgia State head coach Ron Hunter supplied what will probably be the image of the tournament when he fell out of his chair as his son hit the winning shot. A second day of tournament fun starts up midday today. One long walk: Watch as a man takes a selfie a day as he tries to walk from Germany to China. Not happy: Cats big and small \u2013 like this tiny leopard \u2013 hate bath time. Facebook post not found. Post has been removed or is no longer public. Up in the air: An aerobatic pilot takes his friends up for a ride \u2013 and scares the hell out of them. Smart dog: As long as the questions can be answered with a \u201cyes\u201d or a \u201cno,\u201d this dog has all the answers. How long was I there?: Teen thinks he was at the dentist\u2019s office for two years. As much fun as it sounds. Sen. Ted Cruz is running for President.  Violence spreads in Yemen.  And Singapore\u2019s founder dies.",

            "article_content": "The two trailing Democrats made it very clear that they were ready and willing to knock Clinton Clinton, however, declined to respond If it wasn\u2019t obvious that both Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and former Maryland Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley were running behind Hillary Clinton in most national and state presidential polls, Saturday\u2019s jamboree along the Ashley River in South Carolina made it eminently clear. While Clinton declined to directly take on O\u2019Malley and stayed away from the subtle lines she regularly uses to knock Sanders, the two trailing Democrats made it very clear that they were ready and willing to knock the former secretary of state. Before he even took the stage at the South Carolina Democratic Party Blue Jamboree \u2013 an event that brought out all three Democrats \u2013 Sanders issued a statement challenging Clinton on health care and paid family leave. \u201cI am disappointed that Secretary Clinton does not think we should join every other major country in guaranteeing health care through a cost-effective, Medicare-for-all, single-payer system that would save the average family about $5,000 a year,\u201d Sanders said, adding in the same statement that he was \u201csurprised\u201d Clinton doesn\u2019t support Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand\u2019s Family and Medical Leave Act. The lines are an uptick in directness from Sanders, who has in the past has been more subtle in calling out Clinton. O\u2019Malley was even more direct the Sanders, telling reporters after his speech that Clinton, because of her more hawkish foreign policy, had \u201cone foot trapped in the Cold War\u201d and \u201chas never demonstrated a capacity to understand what comes after a regime is toppled.\u201d The former Maryland governor, who endorsed Clinton during her failed presidential run in 2008, also said she would \u201ctake orders from the big banks of Wall Street and create an economy of the few, for the few and by the few\u201d as president. Hillary Clinton's career in the spotlight \u201cI believe in fair market, American capitalism and that is a big difference between Secretary Clinton\u2019s Wall Street crony capitalism and Senator Sanders\u2019 socialism,\u201d he said. Clinton, however, declined to respond, instead delivering her rote stump speech, focusing on expanding Medicaid, Republicans and foreign policy. \u201cI want to do this right and get results,\u201d Clinton said during a riff about the terrorist attacks that rocked Paris last week. The former secretary of state also knocked people \u201cwho would paint with such a broad brush, would want us to somehow isolate, register Muslims, go after Islam.\u201d The line was a not-so-subtle jab at Republican front-runner Donald Trump, who has been accused of suggesting the registration of Muslim Americans into a government-run database over terrorism concerns. \u201cOur enemy are these criminal killers who misuse a religion in order to recruit people and give them the training to go out and kill more people,\u201d she said. At no point during her speech did Clinton mention her Democratic opponents. After signing papers to officially get on the ballot in South Carolina, Clinton dismissed O\u2019Malley when asked about his Cold War line. \u201cWell, I am not going to respond to him. I am going to say go read my speech because obviously, I laid out a comprehensive strategy to deal with ISIS in the air, on the ground and online,\u201d Clinton said, referencing a speech she gave earlier in the week on defeating ISIS. In South Carolina, most polls have the former senator up more than 50 percentage points. And nationally, Clinton generally has a more than 20-point lead over Sanders. O\u2019Malley also has his own problems. Due to his campaign\u2019s problems raising money, the former Maryland governor is shifting resources away from his campaign headquarters in Baltimore and putting more emphasis on early states, especially Iowa. The governor\u2019s campaign started this quarter with less than $1 million. On Saturday, O\u2019Malley flatly said his campaign was not taking on debt to pay for travel and staff. \u201cNo, we are not,\u201d he said. \u201cIn fact, we had the best week of fundraising we have had after the last debate.\u201d And in a hopeful moment, O\u2019Malley added, \u201cI intend to win this nomination.\u201d When a few reporters smiled, he doubled down, \u201cNo, I intend to win this nomination. I intend to win the general election.\u201d",

But even some conservatives who did not support Ryan said that after weeks of infighting, they were eager to move on and give Ryan the space to unite the party\u2019s various factions and craft a legislative agenda. After losing 43 votes in the House GOP internal election a day earlier, only nine House Republicans voted against Ryan on the House floor. Boehner gave a farewell address before the vote on Thursday, a day after the House approved a significant budget deal he negotiated with President Barack Obama and congressional Democrats. The legislation, which eliminates the possibility of a default and decreases the chance of a government shutdown, effectively gives Ryan a fresh start. Will Ryan offer Obama a fresh start with House GOP? After he was sworn in as Speaker, Ryan praised Boehner, calling him \u201ca true class act\u201d and urged members from both sides to come together. Ryan attempted to get members to turn the page saying \u201ca lot is on our shoulders. So if you ever pray, pray for each other \u2013 Republicans for Democrats, Democrats for Republicans.\u201d After a standing ovation Ryan joked, \u201cAnd I don\u2019t mean pray for a conversion.\u201d He becomes the third Catholic in a row in the position, after Boehner and Nancy Pelosi, now the Minority Leader. He took the oath on his own copy of the New American bible and kept the gavel he wielded as Chairman of the powerful tax writing committee. Ryan will face \u2018monumental obstacles\u2019 as speaker Paul Ryan, rising GOP star The 45-year-old Wisconsin Republican first worked on Capitol Hill as a legislative aide in 1992 and won his House seat in 1998 when he was 28. Before officially handing him the gavel, Pelosi congratulated him and noted his path to the speakership went from serving as a young aide, and \u201ca Tortilla Coast waiter,\u201d a restaurant just steps from the Capitol he will now preside over. During his tenure in the House, Ryan became known as a policy wonk and attracted national attention for his sweeping proposals to overhaul Medicare and restructure the tax code. In 2012, Mitt Romney picked Ryan to be his running mate on the GOP ticket. After Republicans lost that election, he returned to the House and ruled out running for president in 2016, instead settling into what he called his \u201cdream job\u201d as chairman of the House tax writing committee. Romney and his wife Ann were watching with Ryan\u2019s family inside the House chamber as he took the oath of office. With the speaker\u2019s title, Ryan takes on a national profile and the difficult challenge of corralling what has been an unruly and divided House GOP conference. In his first speech he said the constant drama wasn\u2019t what the American people wanted and tried to move past it. \u201cWe are not solving problems. We are adding to them. And I am not interested in laying blame. We are not settling scores. We are wiping the slate clean,\u201d Ryan said. As he has been doing in the days leading up to Thursday\u2019s election, Ryan stressed he wanted members to have a greater imprint on legislation, and that he would empower committees and members with expertise to write bills instead of drafting them out of the Speaker\u2019s office. \u201cWe will not always agree \u2013 not all of us, not all of the time. But we should not hide our disagreements. We should embrace them. We have nothing to fear from honest differences honestly stated. If you have ideas, let\u2019s hear them.\u201d After Ryan delivered his maiden speech as Speaker he walked down to shake hands with his colleagues, even with one who voted against him, still holding the Bible he placed his hand on to take the oath of office. Is Ryan the new poster child of work-life balance?",

            "article_content": "Jeb Bush's campaign is pointing to 2008 comeback of John McCain as an example of what he can accomplish Bush's inevitability argument, built around the $100 million that his super PAC raised in the first half of this year, has evaporated An establishment favorite, Bush has struggled in a year dominated by political outsiders It will take more than flying Southwest and carrying his own bag to make Jeb Bush the Republican comeback kid. Outpaced by outsiders Donald Trump and Ben Carson, the one-time GOP front-runner has slashed campaign staff and costs and enlisted his family\u2019s two presidents to reassure worried donors about his White House hopes. Starting with Wednesday night\u2019s debate, his campaign is promising a sharper, more nimble and aggressive candidate and is looking to history for encouragement. Not long before he began stripping down his campaign structure, Bush spoke about John McCain\u2019s phoenix-from-the-ashes revival in 2007, when the Arizona senator traveled on Southwest Airlines to save money and toted his own luggage. McCain came back to win the New Hampshire primary and eventually seize the Republican nomination, a journey that underscored the fact that few establishment favorites reach the nomination without overcoming crisis and underlined the Granite State\u2019s potential for wounded establishment favorites to rescue their campaigns. \u201cEvery winning nominee and every winning presidential candidate walks many lonely miles through the valley of the shadow of political death \u2013 and resiliency is the chief virtue required for victory,\u201d said Steve Schmidt, a former adviser to McCain who helped engineer his comeback. \u201cJohn McCain understood that, as did Barack Obama \u2013 while going through the Rev. (Jeremiah) Wright debacle \u2013 as did George W. Bush, after losing to John McCain in New Hampshire in 2000, and there are many other examples.\u201d Bush will debut his relaunch at the GOP presidential debate in Colorado and in a subsequent swing through New Hampshire. Still, even during the darkest days of their presidential bids, the three most recent Republican nominees \u2013 McCain, Mitt Romney and George W. Bush \u2013 did not face the kind of obstacles that loom for Bush. Each faced a weaker field of opponents with nothing approaching the resources of a Carson or a Trump or other notable candidates such as Marco Rubio and Ted Cruz. Bush\u2019s inevitability argument, built around the $100 million that his super PAC raised in the first half of this year, has evaporated. He is now saddled with the image of a dented front-runner who failed to drum rivals out of the race with a shock-and-awe fundraising blitz. Ben Carson surges as the anti-Trump And the two assets that he brought to the race \u2013 experience and political pedigree \u2013 are no longer strengths. Bush\u2019s last name, family heritage and establishment image hardly help in a race hijacked by outsiders who have ridden a wave of deep voter disgust with the Washington status quo. \u201cHe is trying to have a pragmatic, very practical discussion. It\u2019s not being as well-received,\u201d said Ray Tweedie, a prominent Republican Party official in New Hampshire, who pointed out that high early expectations for Bush were hurting him now. \u201cIf he is not in first place by a long shot, everybody thinks he is done. That is tough when you are fighting the narrative.\u201d High on the list of Bush\u2019s challenges is a deficit of charisma on the campaign trail and the fact that he simply has not been able to connect with grass-roots voters, who are not buying his vision of a conservative who can fix Washington and make it work. Tim Miller, communications director for Bush, told CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer on Tuesday that Bush would begin to make the argument that he\u2019s the only candidate on the GOP stage with the experience and skills to actually be president. \u201cWhat Jeb is going to do is frame this race, as \u2026 he is the guy that can fix the problems that face D.C. D.C. is broken, it is incompetent, it is corrupt. We need someone with a proven conservative record that voters can trust,\u201d Miller said. But that may not be the selling point it once was. In March, 57% of voters who leaned Republican told the Pew Research Center that experience and a proven record were the most important characteristic in a presidential candidate. By September, that number had shrunk to 29%. Many of the angry, grass-roots conservatives who have flocked to Carson and Trump want to blow up the political system entirely, not make it function more effectively, raising the possibility that Bush is simply the wrong man at the wrong time. Disinterest in Bush is a recurring theme in countless interviews with voters in early states. Mentions of his credentials and his record in Florida draw a collective shrug. Voters use phrases such as nice guy, substantive, competent, experienced \u2013 and the deadly Trump moniker \u201clow energy\u201d \u2013 to describe him. As often as Bush vows to run \u201cwith heart\u201d and run \u201cjoyfully,\u201d some voters also say he comes off as impatient, peevish and annoyed with the process in interviews. His attempts to show passion by aggressively hitting back against Trump as an unqualified \u201cjoke\u201d have not produced any measurable gains. The campaign has struggled to raise small dollar donations. And the nagging sense that voters simply do not like Bush has kept many uncommitted bundlers and big-dollar donors resolutely on the sidelines. Jeb Bush rolls out proposals for Social Security, Medicare Often, Bush comes across as despairing at the turn the campaign has taken. A taunting Trump stole his front-runner mantle and got under his skin. Carson has overtaken him the polls despite having no political record whatsoever. And his prot\u00e9g\u00e9, Marco Rubio, has jumped the line and is running against his mentor \u2013 and ahead in the polls. Comparisons between Bush and McCain may not be exact. When McCain relaunched his campaign, he was able to indulge his authentic self \u2013 as a scrappy maverick who always seeks the center of a political fight. \u201cMcCain was a regular guy who could roll up his sleeves and sit down next to you and say \u2018how can I help,\u2019 \u201d Tweedie said. Bush, who is more of a technocrat and a less visceral political operator, will need to show he can pull a similar, loose campaign persona. On Monday, a source familiar with the Bush campaign\u2019s strategy told CNN\u2019s Jamie Gangel that Bush was now \u201cempowered to speak his mind,\u201d promising a much stronger performance on the campaign trail. \u201cI think the governor has to find a way. My advice to him is \u2026 keep your stump speech really short and let people ask questions,\u201d said Tweedie, who described Bush as one of the \u201cbest policy wonks\u201d running and therefore a good fit with many Republicans who are beginning to drill down into detailed policy questions if he can effectively communicate his true self. But when McCain began his long climb back riding around on the Straight Talk Express through New Hampshire and holding more than a 100 town halls, he had already built a reservoir of goodwill among New Hampshire voters who had chosen him as their candidate in an upset to George W. Bush in 2000. Voters there already liked his brand of \u201cstraight talk\u201d politics and his own personal story as a war hero who had been captured and imprisoned in North Vietnam during the Vietnam War. Clinton campaign to run ads during GOP debate One key piece of McCain\u2019s success, several of his former advisers noted, was that he reoriented the campaign away from the narrative about his personal ambitions to a cause \u2013 the need, as he saw it, for a surge of troops in Iraq that would secure the national security interests of the country. He surrounded himself with veterans and went on a \u201cNo Surrender\u201d tour drawing increasing numbers of voters to his town halls in what became a slow rebuilding of his campaign over time. McCain turned his fortunes around, Schmidt said, by \u201cputting a stake down \u2013 not about \u2018I\u2019m turning my campaign around\u2019 \u2013 but \u2018I\u2019m going to fight for this issue and I\u2019m prepared to lose it all over it.\u2019 The first requirement to having a McCain-style comeback is to have a McCain-style issue that allows you to transcend the self-interest of your ambition.\u201d Bush, meanwhile, has produced voluminous policy papers \u2013 including the latest Tuesday on reforming the entitlement system \u2013 but there is no one issue that seems to have struck a chord with voters. From the beginning of the 2012 cycle, Romney faced less capable challengers than Bush, and, as it is now, the GOP electorate was splintered among a dozen GOP candidates. Even as voters flirted with outsiders Newt Gingrich, Herman Cain and Michele Bachmann, Romney\u2019s poll numbers never slid as far as Bush\u2019s have. None of his challengers had the commanding lead that Trump, who has topped almost every national poll since July, has enjoyed. And Romney\u2019s business background at a time when GOP voters were fretting about the economy \u2013 though it hurt him in the general election \u2013 was more in tune with GOP voters than Bush\u2019s message is now. And Bush\u2019s complaint over the weekend \u2013 that there are plenty of other \u201ccool\u201d things he could be doing other than running for president if the job was all about thwarting progress in Washington \u2013 could also hurt him. The comment was revealing because it betrayed Bush\u2019s impatience with the process of running for president in the age of Trump and disdain for the circus-like aspects of the modern presidential campaign. But it also seemed to hint at a sense of entitlement from a man who has already had a tough time addressing the dynastic issue. Bush allies insist it\u2019s too early to panic and that the race is still unsettled as many voters only now begin to tune into the race. They continue to predict a collapse of poll leaders Trump and Carson \u2013 pointing to the flameout front-runners like Bachmann and Cain from cycles past. \u201cWhat is going to happen from now on is the real person that many people now seem to be questioning will come out,\u201d said Rep. Carlos Gonzalez, a New Hampshire state lawmaker who is backing Bush. \u201cHe is coming in full force, you will see him come from behind and be the comeback kid,\u201d said Gonzalez, Poll numbers offer some encouragement to those who think it\u2019s not too late for Bush. After all, at the equivalent stage of the 2008 race, McCain languished behind Romney, and did not lead a single poll in the state until a month before voting. On the downside for Bush however, McCain\u2019s 18% polling number was double his own, four months before the primary, showing a campaign that was already on the road to recovery \u2013 not still mired in crisis. White House hopefuls flock to \u2018SNL\u2019 Still, Neil Levesque, executive director of Saint Anselm College\u2019s Institute of Politics, also believes Bush can still be a very effective candidate if he concentrates on New Hampshire and the theme of the race turns to electability. \u201cI think we will see very different numbers as we get towards February 9 than we see now,\u201d Levesque said. \u201cI do think the state is custom-made for him,\u201d Levesque said, advising Bush to immerse himself in one-on-one interaction voters in a state which often makes its mind up late \u2013 despite the length of its primary campaigns. \u201cFrom what I see from people who go to his events is that people come away thinking \u2018this is a very capable man.\u2019 \u201c",

The endorsement is significant because it is Sanders\u2019 first sizable union endorsement in his quest for the Democratic nomination and comes after Sanders and other Democratic candidates pitched themselves to the AFL-CIO, a group that includes the nurses union, last month. CNN Interactive: 2016 election candidates \u201cBernie Sanders has a proven track record of uncompromised activism and advocacy for working people, and a message that resonates with nurses, and, as we have all seen, tens of thousands of people across the country,\u201d NNU Executive Director RoseAnn DeMoro said in a press release announcing the endorsement. \u201cHe can talk about our issues as well as we can talk about our issues. We are proud to stand with him in his candidacy for President today.\u201d Bernie Sanders' political career The nurses organization officially announced their support at an event with Sanders in Oakland, California. The group, which is 90% women, called the meeting a \u201cBrunch with Bernie.\u201d \u201cBernie\u2019s issues align with nurses from top to bottom,\u201d DeMoro said, noting that Sanders earned the groups support because of his positions on trade, minimum wage and expanding Social Security and Medicare.\u201d Earlier this year, the group conducted an internal poll to decide who to endorse. Charles Idelson, the group\u2019s spokesman, said the Vermont senator won \u201coverwhelming support,\u201d but no percentage was given. Another factor in the group\u2019s decision: Sanders\u2019 speech to the AFL-CIO Executive Council last month, according to Idelson. Sanders, along with former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and former Maryland Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley, spoke before the AFL-CIO executive council last month. The speeches were closed, but provided the candidates with an opportunity to pitch themselves to the large union organization. \u201cHe made it clear that you will never have to wonder which side he is on,\u201d said DeMoro, a member of the AFL-CIO executive council. \u201cAs he told the union leaders, \u2018I see myself as part of you. This is not a conventional moment, we are fighting for the future of this country.\u2019\u201d Most members of the AFL-CIO have held off endorsing in the Democratic primary. Clinton scored the first major union endorsement in July when the American Federation of Teachers endorsed the Democratic frontrunner. Randi Weingarten, the AFT president, is a Clinton supporter and serves on the board of the main pro-Clinton super PAC.",

            "article_content": "Arizona Sen. John McCain will get a top-tier challenger in his bid for re-election later this year now that Democratic Rep. Ann Kirkpatrick has decided to run for the Senate. \u201cI love this state, and I\u2019ve worked hard all my life to put Arizona first,\u201d Kirkpatrick said in a statement announcing her bid on Tuesday. \u201cFrom the timber towns of the White Mountains to the tech hubs of Phoenix and Tucson, we are working to build a strong, diverse economy. I\u2019m fighting for Arizona every single day, and I\u2019d be humbled to represent our state in the United States Senate.\u201d The third-term Democrat beat the odds last cycle by winning re-election in a red-leaning seat despite a tough political climate that swept similar Democrats out of office nationwide. She did so without backing down from her support of Obamacare, which proved toxic for other, more seasoned Democrats, and by emphasizing her local roots and Native American ties. Her moderate profile will give her a boost in what\u2019s sure to be a challenging race from the start. Democrats believe McCain to be vulnerable because of his five-term tenure in the Senate, and he\u2019s expected to face a primary challenge that could leave him weakened for the general. But Arizonans haven\u2019t elected a Democratic senator since the late 80s, and the state has voted Republican in the last four presidential elections. The National Republican Senatorial Committee attacked Kirkpatrick in a statement, tying her to President Barack Obama and saying she \u201cmade life worse\u201d for Arizona families. \u201cAnn Kirkpatrick has been part of the problem in Washington and Arizonans are paying the price.

            "article_content": "Sen. Robert Menendez pleaded not guilty on Thursday to 14 criminal counts against him, including eight counts of bribery in his dealings with Salomon Melgen, a Florida ophthalmologist. During a brief press conference on Wednesday, the senator vehemently asserted his innocence and charged that the prosecutors were the ones who had it wrong. They \u201cdon\u2019t know the difference between friendship and corruption and have chosen to twist my duties as a senator and my friendship into something that is improper,\u201d he said. Sen. Menendez: The truth will come out in court READ: Menendez pleads not guilty to charges The 68-page indictment outlines in colorful detail those duties as a senator \u2014 which include allegedly intervening on behalf of Melgen\u2019s three girlfriends\u2019 visa applications, among other things \u2014 and his friendship \u2014 which includes nearly $1 million in trips, political contributions and other perks. Despite the appearance of payment for services as alleged by the Justice Department, the two have been friends for decades, which Menendez allies say will make it challenging to successfully prosecute the two. As Menendez attorney Abbe David Lowell said during the Thursday press conference, prosecutors \u201chave to prove beyond a reasonable doubt that a 20-year relationship between doctor Melgen and Senator Menendez was something else.\u201d SEE: The complete Menendez indictment We\u2019ve summarized the main takeaways from the Justice Department indictment so you can decide for yourself. One thing, at least, seems clear: Everybody should be so lucky to have a friend like Salomon Melgen. Girlfriend 1:  A Brazilian national who worked as an actress, model and lawyer Melgen offered to help fund graduate school for Girlfriend 1 at the University of Miami, and allegedly asked Menendez, who has been divorced since 2005, to help get her there. According to the indictment, Menendez\u2019s office intervened on her behalf to help move her application for a student visa along in July 2008, but he had met her before her visa interview and knew her as Melgen\u2019s girlfriend. A top Menendez adviser emailed the Deputy Assistant Secretary at Visa Services offering support for the woman\u2019s application, the day before her visa interview: \u201cSen. Menendez would like to advocate unconditionally for Dr. Melgen and encourage careful consideration of [Girlfriend 1]\u2019s visa application.\u201d The application was approved that day, and Melgen supported her education partially through a nonprofit he set up \u2014 called the Sal Melgen Foundation \u2014\u00a0with the self-described purpose of \u201chelp[ing] with the educational needs of disasvantages persons\u201d and \u201cassist[ing] with the economic educational needs of children in developing [sic] countires [sic] and the U.S.\u201d Girlfriend 2: A Dominican national who worked as a model Girlfriend 2 wanted to visit Melgen with her sister in 2008, when she was 22 years old and her sister was age 18. Melgen initially wrote the U.S. embassy in the Dominican Republic asking for their visas to be approved and then contacted Menendez to help \u201cmove the letter along,\u201d according to an email between two Menendez staffers included in the indictment. A Melgen aide told a Menendez staffer, per that email exchange, that the women wanted to visit around Christmas, to sightsee and tour around Palm Beach, and said they were \u201cvery good friends with Melgen.\u201d The Senate staffer said they \u201cpressed for more info, but [the Melgen aide] wouldn\u2019t go beyond that\u201d in elaborating on their relationship. The indictment alleged that Menendez had met the woman in question, however, in 2008, and knew her as Melgen\u2019s girlfriend. Staffers drafted a letter from Menendez to the embassy requesting approval for their applications: \u201cThey plan to visit someone I know well, Dr. Salomon Melgen, who is an eye doctor in Florida.\u201d And the girlfriend asked for a copy of the letter from Melgen in a brief love letter: \u201cI write to remind you that you need to send me a copy of what Senator Bob Menendez\u2019s office sent you, which I need for the embassy,\u201d she wrote. \u201cAnd also remember the bank thing please. Thank You. A Kiss.\u201d Their applications for tourist visas were denied, because as the embassy employee explained in a memorandum, \u201cneither is working. No solvency of their own. Not fully convinced of motives for travel.\u201d After repeated inquiries from Menendez\u2019s staff, their applications were approved after a second interview. But at least one Menendez staffer raised a flag on the process. That staffer emailed another on their personal accounts referencing two people from the Dominican Republic who received visas. \u201cIn my view, this is ONLY DUE to the fact that rm INTERVENED. I\u2019ve told RM,\u201d the staffer wrote. Girlfriend 3: A Ukrainian national who worked as a model and actress Girlfriend number three was granted a visa to travel from Spain to Miami, Florida, to see Melgen after Menendez\u2019s office issued a letter, signed with the senator\u2019s name and advocating on her behalf, to visa officials. The letter says Melgen \u201chas extended an invitation to his good friend [Girlfriend 3] to undergo medical evaluation for plastic surgery as well as to visit with him within the U.S.\u201d It also notes that the girlfriend was \u201cthe broadcast image for channel Tele 5 Spana and thus, a famous person in Spain,\u201d and so has ample ties to Spain that officials shouldn\u2019t be worried that she won\u2019t return home. During her visit, Menendez met the girlfriend over dinner with Melgen at Azul, a restaurant in the Mandarin Hotel. The senator was introduced to the girlfriend, according to the indictment, as the man who helped her with her visa. From Punta Cana to Paris The indictment outlines travel for seven trips Menendez took that Melgen paid for, typically on Melgen\u2019s private jet but at one point on a chartered private jet on which Menendez was the only passenger. The flights largely brought Menendez from New Jersey and Washington down to the Dominican Republic, where Melgen owned a Caribbean Villa (as it\u2019s described in the indictment). One time, Melgen paid for a flight to Punta Cana for a wedding, where he also set Menendez and a guest up in a two-bedroom suite shared with Melgen and his wife, free of charge. Another time, Melgen paid about $875 for a private car company to drive the senator from Hoboken, New Jersey, to and around New York City. Melgen once used nearly 650,000 American Express rewards points to pay for a three-night stay in a luxury hotel in Paris for Menendez to meet up with his girlfriend. The room in the Park Hyatt Paris-Vendome cost nearly $1,540 per night, totaling $4,930 for the three-night stay, and Menendez described it in an email to Melgen as having a \u201cking bed, work area with Internet, limestone bath with soaking tub and enclosed rain shower, [and] views of courtyard or streets.\u201d \u201cYou call American Express Rewards and they will book it for you. It would need to be in my name,\u201d he told Melgen in an email at one point. In 2013, after word of the federal investigation became public, Menendez paid back Melgen $58,000 for the 2010 plane trips calling his failure to properly disclose the flights an \u201coversight.\u201d \u201cDon\u2019t worry. We will take care of it.\u201d That was the response from a Melgen associate to a request from a Menendez aide for contributions to support the senator. In an email sent in April 2012 to a Melgen aide, a Menendez staffer outlined requests for at least $60,000 in donations to entities benefitting Menendez. The staffer said he \u201chumbly wanted to put a big ask\u201d before Melgen, requesting the doctor and his family members contribute a total of $40,000 to the New Jersey Democratic State Committee Victory Federal Account, which would support Menendez and other New Jersey Democrats locked in re-election fights. Melgen\u2019s personal assistant, identified in the indictment only as \u201cPerson A\u201d responded:  \u201cRegarding your request \u2026 don\u2019t worry. We will take care of it. Dr. Melgen will be calling you tomorrow to speak further.\u201d On May 16, 2012, Melgen and his wife contributed $20,000 each to the New Jersey Democratic State Committee Victory Fund and the legal fund for Menendez, and Melgen\u2019s daughter and her husband contributed another $20,000 to the N.J. Democratic Party fund. Melgen appeared to reimburse his daughter with a $20,000 check issued from his ophthalmology practice that same day. More than $750,000 That\u2019s the amount, according to the indictment, that Melgen gave \u2014 through his family and business \u2014\u00a0to entities supporting Menendez\u2019s re-election effort in 2012. Of that, $143,500 went to New Jersey State and County Democratic Party entities. Melgen also contributed approximately $600,000 to Majority PAC, a super PAC backing Democratic Senate candidates and incumbents, in two contributions of $300,000. Both of which were earmarked for the New Jersey Senate race \u2014\u00a0in which Menendez was the only Democratic contender. And Melgen also contributed $8,000 to an unnamed female senator \u2013 who turned out to be Minnesota\u2019s Amy Klobuchar \u2013 after Menendez and his staff asked the doctor directly to help return the fundraising favor to the senator, who had raised money for Menendez\u2019s reelection fight and was facing a primary challenge. Klobuchar announced she was returning the funds following the indictment. \u201cWho has the best juice at CMS and Dept of Health\u201d? That was something Menendez tried to determine when intervening on Melgen\u2019s behalf in a Medicare reimbursement dispute, according to an email he sent to a staffer that was included in the indictment \u2014\u00a0and the senator ended up speaking to the top officials at both the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and the Department of Health and Human Services about the issue. The indictment outlines a multi-year battle between Melgen and federal health officials over $8.98 million he was alleged to have over-billed Medicare for a drug he used in his ophthalmology practice. Guidelines at the Federal Drug Administration and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention called for each vial of the drug to be used for only one patient, to prevent the risk of contamination and the spread of infection, but Melgen allegedly used leftovers from single-use vials to treat additional patients \u2014\u00a0and then billed CMS for the full cost of a single vial for each dose of the drug he administered. According to the indictment, Melgen and his associates repeatedly lobbied Menendez\u2019s office through emails, calls and meetings to intervene on his behalf in the dispute. The senator ultimately secured conversations with both the acting administrator of CMS and the secretary of HHS, and was briefed by Melgen\u2019s team on the dispute before both meetings. He also got then-Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid\u2019s office involved in the dispute, according to multiple scheduling emails sent between the two offices. During a July 2009 phone call with the head of CMS, the indictment alleges that Menendez \u201casserted that CMS\u2019 policy guidelines regarding single-use vials were vague and that a doctor in Florida was being treated unfairly as a result.\u201d When the administrator said they should \u201callow the case to take its course,\u201d Menendez, according to the indictment, told him \u201cnot to tell him about Melgen\u2019s appellate rights and abruptly ended the call.\u201d The indictment alleges that, during his meeting with HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, Menendez \u201cadvocated on behalf of Melgen\u2019s position in his Medicare billing dispute, focusing on Melgen\u2019s specific case and asserting that Melgen was being treated unfairly\u201d \u2014\u00a0an assertion with which the secretary disagreed. The meeting was \u201cquite \u2018lively,\u2019\u201d according to an email from Melgen\u2019s lobbyist to two Menendez staffers after the meeting took place. Menendez staffers also intervened in a trade dispute that would have allegedly affected Melgen\u2019s financial interests in the Dominican Republic. Emails included in the indictment show his staffers sought to prevent Customs and Border Patrol from donating screening equipment at ports that would\u2019ve undermined Melgen\u2019s own screening business there. While there\u2019s no admission from either man in the indictment that any of the trips, contributions or perks Melgen paid for were expressly in exchange for Menendez\u2019s work on his behalf, in a number of instances the dates of the contributions coincide with actions taken by the senator\u2019s office that could have benefited Melgen. The indictment notes that Menendez met with the top official at CMS about the dispute on June 7, six days after Melgen issued a $300,000 donation, through his business, to Majority PAC, earmarked to be used for the New Jersey Senate race. On Oct. 19, 2012, Melgen emailed Menendez, a Menendez staffer and a Majority PAC fundraiser an update on his Medicare billing appeal. That was one week after Melgen issued, through his business, another $300,000 check to Majority PAC to be used for the New Jersey Senate race, and three $25,000 checks to New Jersey Democratic County organizations. The Majority PAC fundraiser, also identified as a former Menendez staffer, replied to Melgen\u2019s email and promised to deliver the update to Menendez next time they saw the senator, later that week. And on Jan. 11, 2013, Menendez directed his staffers via email to contact Customs and Border Patrol and try to prevent them from donating monitoring equipment for shipping ports that the indictment alleges would\u2019ve impacted Melgen\u2019s financial interests. That was the day after Menendez, Melgen and another unnamed person golfed together at the private Banyan Golf Club in West Palm Beach, Florida, where Melgen paid for greens fees and the third person spent nearly $360 for dinner at a steakhouse.",

            "article_content": "President Barack Obama, formally dedicating on Monday an institute to the U.S. Senate and one of its legendary occupants, hailed the importance of the legislative body even while suggesting its best days have faded. Speaking at the Boston waterfront site of the Edward M. Kennedy Institute for the United States Senate, Obama claimed too many current-day senators arrive in Washington only to be corrupted by private interests and campaign money. \u201cPeople get elected into the Senate and then get afraid,\u201d he said. \u201cTed understood the only point of running for office was getting stuff done.\u201d Hailing the late Democrat as the embodiment of a different era of government, Obama said Kennedy placed clarity of purpose over party politics \u2014 and suggested his guidance was needed in a body that\u2019s lost its way. \u201cI did not know Ted as long as some of the speakers here today,\u201d Obama told the crowd that included a slate of current and former lawmakers who served alongside Kennedy during his nearly 50-year tenure. \u201cBut he was my friend,\u201d Obama said. \u201cI owe him a lot. As far as I could tell it was never ideology that compelled him, except insofar as his ideology said you should help people.\u201d Obama was presiding over the official opening of a $78 million museum, conceived by Kennedy himself years before his death, whose centerpiece is a life-size replica of the Senate chamber. The institute was dedicated at a moment when public opinion of Congress has sunk to new depths; organizers hope the museum will teach visiting students how the Senate works, thereby stoking interest in government and civics. Obama said Monday the lessons imparted by the museum could also teach the men and women serving in the real Senate chamber in Washington \u2014 some of whom he said were governing out of fear, rather than a desire to advance the country\u2019s interests. \u201cWhat if we carried ourselves more like Ted Kennedy? What if we worked to follow his example a little bit harder?\u201d he said. Kennedy, known as the \u201cLion of the Senate,\u201d was the last of the country\u2019s most famous political family to serve in the upper chamber (for now). He served for nearly half-a-century, at one point becoming the fourth longest-serving senator in history. His colleague for three of those years was then-Sen. Obama, who worked alongside Kennedy on the chamber\u2019s Health, Education, Labor and Pensions committee. Kennedy\u2019s crucial endorsement of Obama\u2019s presidential bid in 2008, which came as the Democratic primary battle with Hillary Clinton was reaching its nastiest, gave Obama establishment backing against a rival with much of the party support behind her. The ties between the two men went beyond politics: upon arriving at the White House in 2009, Obama hung a seascape Kennedy had painted in his private study off the Oval Office. Months later, after Obama\u2019s Election Night vow to get his two young daughters a puppy, Kennedy delivered as a gift a Portuguese Water Dog \u2014 and took one of the dog\u2019s litter mates as his own pet. He even sent the First Canine, Bo, to his preferred trainer in Virginia. When Kennedy died seven months into Obama\u2019s first term, the President delivered a deeply personal eulogy at a Boston funeral service that attracted hundreds of mourners, including four of the five living U.S. presidents. Speaking ahead of Obama Monday, Biden said Kennedy\u2019s power as a legislator lay not in his deep knowledge of the issues, but in his ability to develop friendships with fellow senators. \u201cConsensus was arrived at by the accumulative effect of personal relations,\u201d Biden said. \u201cThat\u2019s what generated the trust and mutual comity.\u201d Sen. John McCain, who served in the Senate for decades alongside both Biden and Kennedy, said he had \u201cno doubt the place would be a little more productive and a lot more fun if (Kennedy) was there.\u201d Obama\u2019s critics have accused him of eschewing that type of friendship-building on Capitol Hill they argue is necessary for success in Washington. During his remarks, Biden said the political process in Washington was \u201cbroken.\u201d The Republican-controlled Senate, only three months old, has already caused Obama headaches by refusing to bring the President\u2019s nominee for Attorney General, Loretta Lynch, up for a vote. Democrats in the chamber are stalling on his preferred Medicare reform plan. And neither party appears willing to go forward with a war powers resolution he drafted for going after ISIS. Those issues, however, didn\u2019t diminish Obama\u2019s praise for Kennedy during Monday\u2019s ceremony, which also featured members of the Kennedy family and former Senate colleagues of the late Democrat. Included among the bipartisan list of speakers for Monday\u2019s program were McCain and Elizabeth Warren, and former Sens. Tom Daschle and Trent Lott. Kennedy\u2019s longtime Senate colleague, Secretary of State John Kerry, was meant to attend the ceremony but was forced to cancel as nuclear talks continue with Iran in Switzerland.",

            "article_content": "House Speaker John Boehner said his upcoming trip to Israel is no \u201cvictory lap\u201d to celebrate Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s re-election \u2013 and that it was planned months ago, before the Israeli election. The Ohio Republican will travel to Israel this week, while Congress is on recess. He said his plans were made before the rift between Netanyahu and President Barack Obama over how to deal with Iran and Palestine burst into the open. READ: Medicare \u2018doc fix\u2019 passes House \u201cThere are serious issues and activities going on in the Middle East and I think it\u2019s critically important for members of Congress to hear from foreign leaders, other governments, other parts of their government, to get a real handle on the challenges that we face there,\u201d Boehner told CNN\u2019s Dana Bash on \u201cState of the Union\u201d Sunday. Republicans are using the congressional recess to visit Israel. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, was there Sunday, and met with Netanyahu. Boehner said Netanyahu \u2013 who\u2019s been lambasted by Obama for his comments in the lead-up to Israel\u2019s election that a two-state solution to Israel and Palestine\u2019s divide is impossible \u2013 didn\u2019t cross any lines. \u201cWell, he doesn\u2019t have a partner,\u201d Boehner said. \u201cHow do you have a two-state solution when you don\u2019t have a partner in that solution, when you don\u2019t have a partner for peace, when you\u2019ve got a \u2013 when the other state is vowing to wipe you off the face of the earth?\u201d SEE: Senate passes budget plan after long vote-a-rama And he promised to move \u201cvery\u201d quickly toward imposing steep new sanctions on Iran if Obama doesn\u2019t strike a deal with the country to avert its nuclear ambitions \u2013 a deal that Netanyahu opposed during a high-profile speech to Congress during an early-March trip to Washington. Boehner also defended Netanyahu from criticism from Obama and the White House that has mounted over the last month. \u201cI think the animosity exhibited by our administration toward the prime minister of Israel is reprehensible,\u201d Boehner said. \u201cAnd I think that the pressure that they\u2019ve put on him over the last four or five years have frankly pushed him to the point where he had to speak up.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t blame him at all for speaking up,\u201d he said.",

            "article_content": "Senators are slogging through a grueling and exhausting day as they cast scores of back-to-back votes on amendments during the annual budget vote-a-rama, which could last until the wee hours of Friday morning before there is a final vote on the bill. It passed 52 to 46.  Two Republicans with presidential ambitions, Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas and Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, voted against the measure as did all Democrats. It took almost 16 hours to get through all the amendments, many of which were aimed at scoring political points more than making actual policy changes.  That\u2019s because the underlying budget resolution \u2013 and the amendments that passed \u2013 will never become law.  But the measure sets important spending parameters for the committees that approve agency funding. READ: Black women leaders, clergy pray for Lynch vote The Republican-controlled House passed its own budget this week, meaning the different versions will need to be reconciled. Passing a budget is seen as a key mark of whether the majority party is governing effectively. \u201cFor years, the Democrat-led Senate refused to pass a balanced budget; it usually failed to produce any budget at all,\u201d Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said shortly before the votes started. \u201cToday, a Senate under new management is delivering that change.\u201d The GOP budget balances in 10 years, cuts trillions in spending including from Medicare and Medicaid and eliminates Obamacare. It also employs an unorthodox way to add more money for defense spending, despite spending caps Congress agreed to four years ago. Even John McCain, R-Arizona, the chairman of the Armed Services Committee and a supporter of greater defense spending, said the approach is a \u201cgimmick.\u201d SEE: Jim Talent to Scott Walker\u2019s team But it\u2019s a necessary one, he said, because it\u2019s a dangerous world. Repealing Obamacare Perhaps most importantly for Republicans, passing a budget would allow them to use a special Senate rule known as reconciliation. With it, they can repeal Obamacare \u2013 as many Republicans have vowed to do \u2013 without the threat of a Democratic filibuster. While the President has said he would veto the repeal, passing it through both chambers would be a key accomplishment for the GOP. \u201cThe Republicans have a totally different vision of what the country is and should be than we have,\u201d said Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid. Firing back Democrats pushed amendments on climate change, equal pay, infrastructure spending and minimum wage, all aimed at making Republicans squirm. The GOP fired back with amendments on Environmental Protection Agency regulations, Israel, defense spending, tax cuts and other issues designed to put Democrats on the spot. Potential 2016 presidential candidates Paul and Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Florida, skirmished over competing proposals to boost defense spending.  The key difference between their proposals was that Paul\u2019s include offsets so the additional defense funds wouldn\u2019t raise the deficit.  Both measures failed but Paul\u2019s got blasted, picking up support from only three other senators.    Cruz voted for Rubio\u2019s amendment but against Paul\u2019s. A Democratic proposal to allow workers to earn up to seven days of paid sick leave passed on a surprisingly strong 61-39 vote.  Several Republicans up for re-election voted with all Democrats to support the measure but the four GOP senators on the presidential track voted against it. Winning support Another Democratic proposal that won the support of 11 Republicans was an amendment by Sen. Brian Schatz of Hawaii to allow Social Security and Veterans Affairs benefits for legally married same-sex couples even if they live in a state that doesn\u2019t allow gay marriage.  Ron Johnson who is up for re-election in Wisconsin and newly elected Sen. Thom Tillis of North Carolina were among the Republicans who backed the proposal which passed 57-43. An amendment from Rubio to move the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem passed on a voice vote. Before the votes, Sen. Johnny Isakson, R-Georgia, quipped, \u201cDon\u2019t go out and have a beer before late night votes.  It makes you sleep,\u201d when asked for advice on how to survive the long day. \u201cI brought my shoes with the big cushion soles instead of the leather soles,\u201d Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Florida, another veteran of the night, said with a knowing smile. A new vote every 20 minutes Senators were tethered to the floor while a new vote was called every 20 minutes or so, huddling with staffers, constituents, lobbyists and others as meetings move from Senate offices to makeshift gatherings in the Capitol. \u201cThere is no doubt that the process gets misused to just simply make the other side cast uncomfortable votes,\u201d Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, said. \u201cI think that\u2019s unfortunate because I think the budget should be a serious process, and when we do a vote-a-rama \u2014 where we will vote 40 times into the wee hours of the morning with only a minute of explanation pro and a minute of explanation against the amendment \u2014 it\u2019s hard to say it\u2019s a dignified process worthy of the United States Senate, which is supposed to be the world\u2019s most deliberative body.\u201d Nine and half hours into voting, McConnell and Reid implored senators to withdraw amendments or accept quick voice votes on them so senators could leave. \u201cAt the rate we\u2019re going, we could be here unit 5 o\u2019clock in the morning,\u201d McConnell said.  \u201cIt\u2019s, I think, a good time to seek some cooperation.\u201d \u201cNo one\u2019s election is going to be determined by what\u2019s taken place here tonight,\u201d Reid added.  \u201cI defy anyone to show me in any of these vote-a-ramas were a vote has made any difference.\u201d Reid promised to buy dinner for everyone when the Senate reconvenes after a two week recess if they could finish by 1130pm.  They did not. CNN\u2019s Athena Jones contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Recently, it's been Republicans who have been in attention-getting, bruising primaries A platoon of Democrats are mulling Senate bids in Ohio, Florida, Maryland, California, Pennsylvania and Illinois Of the nine Senate seats rated as toss-up or competitive in 2016, seven are held by Republicans Democrats who have gleefully watched Republican infighting for years are about to feel some heat of their own. As the party works to retake control of the Senate in 2016, Democrats are looking at a Senate landscape that could feature titanic intraparty clashes starring big personalities who have been waiting years for a shot at the big time. It\u2019s a big shift from recent years when Republicans, riven by long-standing ideological fault lines, faced divisive and attention-grabbing primaries, usually pitting a party favorite against insurgents from the conservative grassroots. Memorably, in 2010 and 2012, the fights were so damaging that Republicans failed to pick up winnable Senate seats by nominating flagrantly unprepared candidates. Democrats, for the most part, have not had to face the same problem. But that might be changing. While the fields of candidates are still taking shape, a platoon of Democrats are mulling Senate bids in Ohio, Florida, Maryland, California, Pennsylvania and Illinois. While many of them have yet to formally declare campaigns, none possess the kind of field-clearing star power that could help Democrats avoid a primary bonanza, and few show signs of putting their ambitions aside for the sake of party unity. Republican primary battles aren\u2019t going anywhere in 2016, and on the presidential level, Democrats continue to line up behind Hillary Clinton as their nominee, without a whiff a serious primary challenge. READ: Hillary Clinton\u2019s latest comeback But there is a different story unfolding in the next race for the Senate, where the question is whether Democrats will cleave along ideological and generational lines in primary fights, jeopardizing the party\u2019s hopes of regaining control of the the Upper Chamber. \u201cThe great irony of Democrats celebrating fissures amongst Republicans in recent years is that historically they\u2019re much less capable of confronting the extreme elements within their party than the GOP,\u201d said Josh Holmes, a former top strategist to Republican Senate Leader Mitch McConnell. \u201cNow we\u2019re watching several years of pent-up liberal aggression about to spill into divisive primaries that will undoubtedly complicate things considerably for their Senate chances.\u201d Democrats scoff at the idea, claiming that no potential candidate has the ability to fumble away a Senate win against the many Republicans up for re-election next year. Of the nine Senate seats rated as toss-up or competitive the Rothenberg & Gonzales Political Report, seven of them are held by Republicans elected in the tea party wave of 2010. Democrats need a net gain of five seats to take back the Senate. \u201cUnfortunately for the numerous vulnerable Republican senators, there are no Todd Akins here, and there isn\u2019t a single state on the map with a Democratic primary that will negatively impact our ability win the state,\u201d said Justin Barasky, the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee\u2019s communications director. Akin, of course, was the GOP nominee in Missouri in 2012 who derailed his own campaign with a comment about \u201clegitimate rape.\u201d Last cycle, Barasky said, Democrats witnessed hotly contested Senate primaries in New Jersey, Massachusetts and Hawaii. All of those fights were in blue states, of course. But none of them resulted in a November loss for Democrats. READ: Congress fails to do its homework (again) Republicans, though, are hoping to breathe life into the narrative, especially with Democratic primaries brewing in the competitive states of Florida and Ohio. \u201cDemocrats are facing messy primaries in key Senate races across the country, and there doesn\u2019t seem to be any end in sight,\u201d said Andrea Bozek, communications director for the National Republican Senatorial Committee. \u201cThe infighting is so bad that it\u2019s not just limited to candidates in key races, but is even playing out between Harry Reid and the DSCC in Washington.\u201d The most crowded lane, for now, appears to be in Maryland, where five-term Sen. Barbara Mikulski is retiring. In a state that reliably goes blue in federal elections, the retirement has at long last opened a door for a raft of Democrats in Congress eyeing higher office. With the exception of House Democratic Whip Steny Hoyer, nearly every Democrat in Maryland\u2019s eight-member congressional delegation has signaled some kind of interest in the Senate seat. NAACP President Benjamin Jealous and Baltimore Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake have also been floated as contenders. Despite the microscopic ideological differences between the likely candidates, the race has already been heralded as a battle between the party\u2019s play-it-safe establishment and its restive liberal wing. Harry Reid, the Democratic leader in the Senate, declined to stay neutral and promptly endorsed Rep. Chris Van Hollen for the seat, a sign that the national party apparatus might be in his corner. The DSCC, however, has not picked a side in the race. Progressive groups, meanwhile, have championed a known figure from their community: Rep. Donna Edwards, who joined the race last week vowing to protect Social Security and Medicare, \u201cno ifs ands buts or willing-to-considers.\u201d That was seen as a poke at Van Hollen, who said in 2012 he was \u201cwilling to consider\u201d entitlement changes as part of deficit negotiations. But even if the primary turns into a pitched battle over progressive priorities, there is little chance the nomination fight would hinder Democratic hopes in Maryland, which hasn\u2019t seen a GOP senator since Charles Mathias in 1987. And Mathias, a civil rights advocate and skeptic of Ronald Reagan, was one of the most liberal members of the Republican Party. Republicans are also hoping for Democratic carnage in Ohio, where Sen. Rob Portman is up for re-election. National Democrats have endorsed former Gov. Ted Strickland for the nomination, but the news did not force P.G. Sittenfeld, an up-and-coming 30-year-old Cincinnati city councilman, out of the race. Democrats are skeptical that Sittenfeld can raise the kind of money to compete against Strickland and Portman, but if he does, his candidacy will make for a stark contrast against the 73-year old Strickland. In an interview, Sittenfeld spoke critically of Portman, calling him \u201ca 25-year creature of Washington\u201d who is \u201cout of touch\u201d with Ohio. But the next-generation rhetoric could also stir inevitable questions about Strickland\u2019s age. \u201cI fit the mold for new leadership,\u201d Sittenfeld told CNN in an interview, careful to note his admiration for Strickland and stressing that he is running against Portman. \u201cIf you put together 100 people into the Senate, wouldn\u2019t you want at least one person from the largest generation in American history, the most technologically savvy generation in American history?\u201d Sittenfeld asked. \u201cHow can we invest  in technology and innovation to solve problems when we are rehashing stale battles?\u201d As in Maryland, there appear to be no major early-stage differences between Strickland and Sittenfeld on the issues, which again suggests that the Democratic primary boom of 2016 is more about timing and opportunity than anything else. With a presidential election on the ballot, increased voter turnout is expected to give Democrats a lift in the general election. \u201cThere is an ideological reason for running, but let\u2019s not separate that from a path to victory,\u201d said Nathan Gonzales, editor of the Gonzales & Rothenberg Report. \u201cPrimaries happen when multiple candidates see a good opportunity. Democrats have good opportunities in multiple states this cycle, specifically in Maryland. The Democratic nomination is incredibly valuable because Maryland is a Democratic state. Lots of candidates see paths to victory and think, \u2018Why not me? Why not now?\u2019 \u201c And while primaries can drain financial resources and drive uncomfortable headlines, the contests are not necessarily damaging, Gonzales said. \u201cCrowded and expensive primaries do not prohibit general election victory,\u201d he said. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean that a party can\u2019t win.\u201d Brad Todd, a Republican consultant who worked on several top tier Senate races in 2014, said the primaries might boost Democrats. \u201cSome of those primaries will animate elements of their base, including some donors, more than the general elections,\u201d he said. But Todd said the rush of primary activity for Democrats does not compare to the pitched tea party-versus-establishment battles that have roiled his party for years. \u201cI don\u2019t see that happening with Democrats as much as it does with Republicans since all of their candidates are pretty much orthodox liberals,\u201d he said. \u201cThere\u2019s no such thing as a centrist Democrat anymore, so there won\u2019t be nearly as many sabers to rattle against them in primaries.\u201d",

Follow him on Twitter @FordVox. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. Supreme Court has upheld federal subsidies for ACA Ford Vox: Decision a huge blow to ideological opponents of universal health care The Supreme Court\u2019s forceful 6 to 3 opinion upholding a key provision of the Affordable Care Act is now in place. Obamacare is settled law. \u201cCongress passed the Affordable Care Act to improve health insurance markets, not to destroy them,\u201d Chief Justice John Roberts wrote for the majority. And in doing so, his court has handed down a decision that is a devastating blow to ideological opponents of universal health care and solidifies a fundamental new deal between Americans and our government. As a doctor who focuses on cases of catastrophic injuries, where my patients have frequently seen their incomes change and the insurance they once had run out or become unaffordable (or unavailable with a \u201cpre-existing\u201d condition), today\u2019s ruling represents an enormous relief. I\u2019ve long been a supporter of Obamacare, because I know how important it is for my patients. The court saw through the plaintiff\u2019s thin claims, which rested on a line in the Affordable Care Act. When read literally, the line implies that only state-based insurance exchanges can supply applicants with the necessary tax credits to make insurance affordable. As the court pointed out, the law must be read as a whole document, and when you do that, the actual meaning is clear. Roberts specifically cited a passage where the law calls for the federal government to stand in for the states and establish \u201csuch exchange\u201d if a state does not do so. Much of the law simply makes no sense read any other way, such as its careful directions that all exchanges, whether state or federal, serve qualified individuals. In the plaintiff\u2019s view, there are no qualified individuals in any of the states where federal exchanges operate, the Supreme Court pointed out. True, Obamacare didn\u2019t escape the Supreme Court without criticism. The court pointed out that the rushed legislative process led to \u201cinartful\u201d drafting. For example, almost comically, the ACA contains three sections labeled the same: \u201cSection 1563.\u201d But nobody looks to the law for art, even if a Supreme Court justice might wish it so. It\u2019s all about the function, and in that sense, the ACA is clear. The court carefully outlined the law\u2019s lineage back to a particularly fertile laboratory of democracy, Massachusetts, which birthed the law\u2019s three \u201cinterlocking\u201d features of an insurance mandate, open insurance markets and tax credits. If the ACA is the direct descendent of that state\u2019s universal health care plan (which brought the uninsured rate down to 2.6%), then it\u2019s absurd to think that the law\u2019s drafters intentionally unlocked any of these interlocking policies. Without tax credits, there\u2019s no effective insurance mandate, because the insurance rates will often exceed the 8% income limit prescribed in the law, leaving the law\u2019s three-legged stool without two of its legs. Moreover it doesn\u2019t do much good to require community-priced insurance that\u2019s open to everyone regardless of pre-existing conditions if people can\u2019t afford it. But it\u2019s the law\u2019s very name - the Affordable Care Act \u2013 that was perhaps the best uncited evidence that the case was a hopeless Hail Mary pass from the start. In his ppinion piece for CNN, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker argued vehemently that if the court overturned the ACA, the ball would be in the President\u2019s court. He insisted that it would be the President\u2019s responsibility to repeal and replace the ACA. This is rich stuff when you consider that Walker and other Republican governors stood in the door against Medicaid expansion and refused to do anything to help the law deliver insurance access in their states. Walker should reflect on how lucky he is that the court didn\u2019t rule his way, because he and other Republican governors would have found themselves under enormous pressure as millions of Americans lost their insurance coverage. With two Supreme Court rulings upholding the law, the dynamics of the 2016 presidential election are changing, and the debate can no longer be about flawed or unconstitutional legislation. What\u2019s more, Republicans like Walker can\u2019t now simply sit back and cheer in the hopes that the Supreme Court would do their will while defraying the blame as a dismantled law leaves Americans uninsured. The days when the Republicans could try to claim some kind of moral authority about the ACA\u2019s alleged evils have surely been banished by this emphatic decision. The problem for the Republicans now is that their all-in support of the King v. Burwell challenge means the party has lost the chance to influence discussion of what is now a major function of our government. Whether federal or state, a major part of the job for our policymakers \u2013 and wannabe leaders \u2013 is ensuring access to quality, affordable health care. By backing this failed effort, they have missed a real opportunity to contribute meaningfully. Ultimately, the ACA joins Medicare itself in the pantheon of American progress. Attempting to repeal the ACA, even under a future Republican president and Congress, is now as unthinkable as repealing Medicare itself. This is an important day for my patients, past and future.

She is curator of Puerto Rico En Serio, an online community focused on issues affecting Puerto Rico and the diaspora. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. Puerto Rico's economy is heading for a nosedive, and the territory is likely to default this year Gretchen Sierra-Zorita: Presidential candidates who court Puerto Rican votes should help the territory Every four years, U.S. presidential candidates take side trips to Puerto Rico in search of primary votes and campaign contributions. In the States, Puerto Ricans view these trips favorably. In the territory, U.S. citizens cannot vote for president but they can participate in presidential primaries and national party conventions. Jeb Bush has already visited the territory and Hillary Clinton will go there, too. Visiting candidates support statehood or Puerto Rico\u2019s right to self-determination. But Puerto Rico can only change its status through an act of Congress, and Congress will not act until a supermajority of Puerto Ricans reaches a consensus. More imperative to the well-being of Puerto Ricans is the territory\u2019s economy, which is heading for a nosedive. Puerto Rico is likely to default this year. Its cash reserves are dangerously low and could be depleted by the end of September if the government is unable to sell new debt or take emergency actions to preserve cash. The Obama administration will not bail out Puerto Rico and Congress is being aggressively lobbied by creditors with competing interests. Puerto Rico\u2019s debt stands at $72 billion. There is also a $34 billion shortfall on payments to public pensions. The governor\u2019s budget proposes to cut more than $600 million and includes closing 95 schools and 20 public agencies. The legislature approved increases to sales and service taxes. Unfortunately, it is all too little and too late. Austerity measures might give Puerto Rico access to financial markets but they will not liquidate the debt nor stimulate a stagnant economy. Protests by anxious and frustrated citizens have become commonplace. Puerto Rico\u2019s economic crisis began in 2006 with the termination of the federal corporate tax exemptions that sustained the island since the 1950s. The situation was aggravated by deficit spending and the 2008 recession. Buried in debt and without full U.S. federal support, it is difficult for Puerto Rico to right its course on its own. Allowing the Puerto Rican economy to implode will be costly to creditors, businesses and ultimately the U.S. government. The United States has a moral obligation and economic incentive to intervene. Moreover, aspiring presidential candidates should be motivated to act. Why? Because the Puerto Rican voters in Florida are crucial to the 2016 election. Florida is essential to any presidential win. In 2012, Puerto Ricans emerged as the new swing voters in Florida. Obama won the state by less than 1% and attracted 86% of the Puerto Rican vote. Puerto Ricans are not affiliated to one political party. They voted for Republican Jeb Bush as governor and for Democratic Barack Obama as president. In central Florida, they have elected three Democratic and three Republican state legislators of Puerto Rican descent. Florida has become the primary destination for Puerto Ricans leaving the embattled island. Close to 900,000 live in the state and their numbers are growing. They are invested in Puerto Rico\u2019s future because most of them were born on the island. As independent voters in a state with a history of tight elections, they are in a prime position to demand greater federal involvement in Puerto Rico\u2019s economic recovery. Those candidates who wish to win over Florida\u2019s Puerto Rican voters would do well to specify what actions they are willing to take to help the distressed territory. A list of deliverables could include the following: \u2013 Endorse pending legislation to allow Puerto Rico\u2019s municipalities and government-owned corporations to restructure their debts as allowed in all 50 states under Chapter 9 federal bankruptcy law. \u2013 Address inequities in the application of Medicare, Medicaid and the Affordable Care Act to Puerto Rico. Of immediate concern is next year\u2019s 11% cut to Puerto Rico\u2019s Medicare Advantage premiums, compared to the approximately 3% increase in all 50 states. Puerto Ricans pay the full federal payroll tax that finances Medicare. \u2013 Launch a U.S.-Puerto Rico partnership to help eliminate the culture of dependency on the U.S. government by increasing employment, spurring private sector growth, improving education, upgrading infrastructure, and fixing government finances. The President\u2019s Task Force on Puerto Rico has done preliminary work in this area. \u2013 Hire Puerto Ricans to work in key positions in the campaign and ensure that the interests of Puerto Rico and other U.S. territories are represented in the candidate\u2019s agenda. These recommendations are just a start. They offer a new way of thinking for candidates who want to take Puerto Ricans and their votes seriously. If Puerto Ricans are expected to turn out for a candidate the way they did for Obama in Florida in 2012 they should be able to expect something in return. Flying to Puerto Rico to talk about the island\u2019s status, dance a little salsa, and try a fritter or two will no longer be sufficient. Follow us on Twitter @CNNOpinion.

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Timothy Stanley is a historian and columnist for Britain\u2019s Daily Telegraph. He is the author of the new book \u201cCitizen Hollywood: How the Collaboration Between L.A. and D.C. Revolutionized American Politics.\u201d The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. Timothy Stanley:  Mike Huckabee mulling 2016 run; Americans should get serious about him He says Huckabee can sell conservative ideas with a humanity not seen since Reagan Mike Huckabee is thinking about running for the presidency a second time. He\u2019s super serious about it. You can tell because not only has he quit his TV show to spend time thinking about it, and written a book (\u201cGod, Guns, Grits and Gravy,\u201d due out on January 20), but he\u2019s also booked a tour of Israel. Next to New Hampshire, Jerusalem might be the best place to run a hotel at election time. We should be serious about Huckabee too. As Aaron Blake points out in The Washington Post, when he ran in the 2008 Republican primaries, he not only took Iowa but swept much of the South as well \u2013 scooping more than 20% of all the votes cast nationwide. Blake attributes this to Huckabee\u2019s unusual appeal within the evangelical community, which is linked to Huckabee\u2019s previous role as a preacher. For sure, there was a regional pattern to the vote. But he also had a tremendous potential that went unrealized in \u201908. Huckabee quit early due to a shortage of cash, so we never got to see how well he could run in a great number of states. Moreover, his early performances were hindered by the candidacy of Fred Thompson \u2013 a dour, sour old stick who only seemed to be in the race to hurt Huckabee. It\u2019s fair to say that Thompson denied Huckabee a win in South Carolina and thus the momentum he needed to go the distance. Huckabee ends Fox News show The strange bitterness of the Thompson vs. Huckabee fight is a reminder that the Republican Party is far more philosophically diverse than the Democratic alternative. Huckabee is loathed by conservatives of a more libertarian, anti-state hue. They suspect that he is a big-government conservative. By that they mean a ruthless populist who will spend money to buy votes while keeping die-hard conservatives on board with appeals to religious prejudice. A more generous interpretation is that Huckabee was a Republican elected to office in a traditionally Democratic state (Arkansas) which also had a serious poverty problem. He eschewed low-tax, anti-government rhetoric in favor of spending money in the interests of the common good \u2013 a cautious, rational position that is widely regarded as philosophically conservative everywhere but at the wealthy think tanks of Washington. The libertarian Reason magazine provides a list of Huckabee quotes intended to damn him, including one in which he describes their anti-tax agenda as \u201ca heartless, callous, soulless type of economic conservatism because it says \u2018look, we want to cut taxes and eliminate government. If it means that elderly people don\u2019t get their Medicare drugs, so be it. If it means little kids go without education and healthcare, so be it.\u2019 Well, that might be a quote pure economic conservative message, but it\u2019s not an American message. \u2026 That\u2019s not historic Republicanism. Historic Republicanism does not hate government; it\u2019s just there to be as little of it as there can be.\u201d Huckabee\u2019s analysis is historically accurate and canny. Americans may have a cultural distrust of large government in general, but polls and election returns suggest they still favor those parts of state activity that benefit them personally. And why not? If the state were to shrivel up to nothing, the result would not be conservative as much as anarchic. Those who wish to preserve family, tradition and the American way have little to gain from unleashing the full forces of amoral, unrestrained capitalism. Free markets do not respect God. For instance, did deregulation of the banking sector really result in rugged individualism and families flourishing free from the state? Or did it wreck the economy, tearing apart communities and triggering even greater political demand for government intervention? Chaos often excuses authoritarianism. The libertarian might say that this argument is liberal in Republican clothing \u2013 but, again, it\u2019s a matter of what kind of society people are trying to preserve. Huckabee would likely not use the state for progressive causes as the Democrats would, but for conservative ones. And what makes him such a compelling candidate is his unique ability to articulate that right-wing vision. It was his debate performances that pushed him to the front of the 2008 pack, when he gave a defense of marriage, life and biblical teachings that suggested he was a Christian without being angry about it. Most Republicans who talk about social conservatism come off as either fanatical or disingenuous. Huckabee seemed normal. Such an ability to sell conservative ideas with a glimmer of humanity hasn\u2019t been seen since Ronald Reagan. Will it work again in 2016? Maybe. Huckabee faces the problem that the social-conservative field is crowded, already containing both Rick Santorum and Ted Cruz. Media attention and intellectual excitement might be focused on Jeb Bush and Rand Paul. And if Chris Christie runs, then frankly, the field will have another blue-collar, ordinary-person candidate of above-average size (a matter that Huckabee has tried to cash in on with a book). Who's in the mix for 2016 But none of these men has Huckabee\u2019s unique ability to speak through the television cameras and straight to the viewer at home. And, aside from Santorum, none of them has run for the nomination before. Republicans are typically cautious voters who encourage a candidate to run twice, or even thrice, before nominating them: Mitt Romney, John McCain, Bob Dole, George H.W. Bush and Reagan were all veterans of the presidential primaries. Here in London, you can tell that the U.S. presidential election is only about 600 days away because every restaurant here seems to contain a senator or a governor. Why do they come to Britain? Whatever their motivation, nine times out of 10 they wish they hadn\u2019t. Read CNNOpinion\u2019s new Flipboard magazine. Follow us on Twitter @CNNOpinion. Join us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion.",
