            "article_content": "President Barack Obama, heading toward the exit, is working to punctuate his record on race. He told Trevor Noah on \u201cThe Daily Show\u201d that the country has \u201cby no means overcome the legacies of slavery and Jim Crow and colonialism and racism.\u201d Speaking to Ta-Nehisi Coates for an Atlantic magazine cover, Obama said he \u201cnever doubted \u2026 my ability to get white support\u201d during his two presidential campaigns. And talking with CNN\u2019s Fareed Zakaria, he alleged some of his opponents were \u201cabsolutely\u201d feeding off bias. Preparing to depart office, Obama is undergoing a farewell tour of interviews, many focused on his experience and legacy as the nation\u2019s first African-American president. 100 moments from Obama's presidency It\u2019s a topic he\u2019s grown more comfortable discussing candidly as his term winds to a close. And it\u2019s one that\u2019s only gained more prominence since Donald Trump \u2013 who flamed the racially tinged birther theory \u2013 was elected President. Obama hopes to provide a positive summation of his time in office while acknowledging centuries-old racial tension was never going to be resolved by his historic election. It\u2019s not the only area he\u2019s looking to tie up before he departs in January. He delivered a final assessment of his foreign policy during a visit to the Florida headquarters of US Special Command last week. And officials say a formal farewell speech is likely when Obama returns from his winter vacation in Hawaii next month. But in his recent interviews \u2013 lengthier than his normal sit-downs \u2013 Obama has focused more heavily on race, an issue that was always going to feature prominently in his legacy. On \u201cThe Daily Show,\u201d Obama tried to explain how he spoke publicly about the issue, balancing a need to delve honestly into problems without inflaming tensions. \u201cIf I\u2019m communicating my genuine belief that those who are not subject to racism can sometimes have blind spots or lack appreciation of what it feels to be on the receiving end of that \u2026 I always felt that if I really knew that and I just communicated it as clearly as I could, that I\u2019d be OK,\u201d he said. That approach hasn\u2019t always pleased black activists and leaders, some venting frustration Obama wasn\u2019t saying enough to support their point of view. Some prominent African-Americans even accused Obama of being overly harsh in his assessments of why their communities were lagging behind in graduation rates and unemployment. And he\u2019s been rebuffed, at times, by members of the Black Lives Matter movement that sprung from repeated incidents of police brutality that transpired while he was president. \u201cThat sort of lack of awareness on the part of an activist about the constraints of our political system and the constraints on this office, I think, sometimes would leave me to mutter under my breath. Very rarely did I lose it publicly. Usually I\u2019d just smile,\u201d Obama told Coates, who himself has been critical of some of the President\u2019s approaches on racial issues. \u201cThe reason I say that is because those are the times where sometimes you feel actually a little bit hurt,\u201d Obama said, a rare admission of how personal some of the criticism directed toward him became. For Obama, issues of race are inherently personal in ways that they weren\u2019t for his predecessors. He entered office confronting outsized expectations for advancing racial progress but also, in the eyes of certain allies, a strain of inherent racial bias against his agenda. \u201cI think there\u2019s a reason why attitudes about my presidency among whites in Northern states are very different from whites in Southern states,\u201d Obama told Zakaria in a CNN special report. \u201cAre there folks whose primary concern about me has been that I seem foreign, the other? Are those who champion the \u2018birther\u2019 movement feeding off of bias? Absolutely.\u201d In his attempts to push the country toward greater equality, it\u2019s often Obama\u2019s personal message \u2013 his story and his success \u2013 that\u2019s held the most impact. At the White House Wednesday, the young man who introduced Obama at a mentorship summit, Malachi Hernandez, said Obama had inspired him after a roundtable meeting last year to reconnect with his own father. Standing in front of seven participants in his My Brother\u2019s Keeper program, Obama emphasized again that issues of racial disparity were personal for him. \u201cI see myself in these young people,\u201d Obama said in his remarks. \u201cI grew up without a father. There were times when I made poor choices, times where I was adrift. The only difference between me and a lot of other young men is that I grew up in a forgiving environment.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Fareed Zakaria examines the triumphs and struggles during President Barack Obama\u2019s time in the White House. Watch \u201cThe Legacy of Barack Obama\u201d on Wednesday at 9 p.m. ET. President Barack Obama\u2019s election in 2008 broke a racial barrier that set soaring expectations for an era of improved race relations. Now, as he departs office, those hopes have largely evaporated. Tensions between African-American communities and police departments have deteriorated following a slate of high-profile shootings of unarmed black men. The man who will replace Obama in January was a leading peddler of the racially-tinged \u201cbirther\u201d myth. A majority of Americans now say relations between blacks and whites have worsened since Obama took office. Trump's final word on the birther controversy Obama has said he never believed his election could completely erase centuries of racial conflict in America. But the decline in racial ties is nonetheless an ironic legacy for the first African-American president, one Fareed Zakaria explores in the CNN Special Report \u201cThe Legacy of Barack Obama\u201d airing Wednesday at 9 p.m. ET. In interviews, Obama and those who worked closely with him identify a strain of racial bias that hardened against the President, even as his election crumbled a historic racial wall. \u201cI think there\u2019s a reason why attitudes about my presidency among whites in Northern states are very different from whites in Southern states,\u201d Obama told Zakaria. \u201cAre there folks whose primary concern about me has been that I seem foreign, the other? Are those who champion the \u2018birther\u2019 movement feeding off of bias? Absolutely.\u201d Obama said he didn\u2019t view racism as a major component of mainstream Republican opposition to his policies. Instead, he said it exists on the political fringe. Those who have worked for him, however, do identify race as a factor in consistent Republican efforts to stymie Obama\u2019s agenda in Washington. \u201cIt\u2019s indisputable that there was a ferocity to the opposition and a lack of respect to him that was a function of race,\u201d said David Axelrod, Obama\u2019s former senior adviser and now a CNN senior political commentator. He recalled a moment when a powerful Republican said to him, \u201cyou know, we don\u2019t really think you should be here, but the American people thought otherwise so we\u2019re going to have to work with you.\u201d Republicans fiercely reject the charge that race played a role in their opposition to Obama\u2019s agenda, insisting their differences are ideological. But a racial undercurrent has charged anti-Obama sentiments, even in debates over policy, from the beginning of his first term. In a confluence of events, the first racial controversy of his presidency \u2013 a dust-up involving the arrest of a black Harvard professor on his own porch \u2013 coincided with the angry backlash to Obama\u2019s proposed reforms to health care, a debate that took on racist undertones during public protests. The episode involving Henry Louis Gates in Cambridge, Massachusetts, came in July 2009, seven months into Obama\u2019s presidency. After Gates was arrested by a white police officer who accused him of disorderly conduct, Obama alleged during a press conference the police acted \u201cstupidly\u201d \u2013 an assessment that drew anger from the right. Glenn Beck, the conservative commentator, accused Obama of hating white people, and called the President a racist. A GOP congressman introduced a resolution calling on Obama to apologize. The President did emerge two days later to concede he \u201ccould have calibrated those words differently.\u201d He invited Gates and the police officer for beers on the White House South Lawn to smooth things over. But the incident instilled in Obama a cautionary approach toward race in the ensuing years of his presidency \u2013 disheartening some of his supporters. \u201cBlack moral witness falls silent because if the President can\u2019t talk about this without being sent to the woodshed, to be on an equal basis with some random cop, it\u2019s over,\u201d said Van Jones, who worked in the Obama White House during the Gates incident and is now a CNN political commentator. Obama largely avoided discussing race for the next three years. But the topic was unavoidable in 2012 when the killing of unarmed Florida teenager Trayvon Martin spurred new discord between police departments and African-American communities. Obama emerged to say if he had a son, \u201che would look like Trayvon,\u201d a deeply personal sentiment that thrust him into the center of a fresh debate over race in America. The ensuing years only saw the tensions deepen as repeated violent incidents drew scrutiny across the country. In places like Ferguson, Missouri, and Baltimore, protests erupted over the police treatment of black men. Some wanted Obama to say more in support of the emerging Black Lives Matter movement. Others accused him of siding with protesters at the expense of law enforcement. It was a balancing act that became a near-constant presence during his second term in office. An inflection point came in June 2015, when Obama traveled to Charleston, South Carolina, to mourn the nine victims gunned down during Bible study at the Emanuel African Methodist Episcopal Church. The crime was explicitly racist in nature \u2013 the shooter declared he was there to \u201ckill black people\u201d \u2013 and the President\u2019s eulogy evolved into a meditation on race at a moment of national introspection. Obama\u2019s speech moved beyond just grief for the victims \u2013 the President stepped directly into a national conversation about race in which he plays a central role. He declared the Confederate flag a symbol of racial oppression, and praised the renewed urgency in removing it from the South Carolina State Capitol. At the end of his remarks, the President paused in the silent arena hall before singing the opening strains of \u201cAmazing Grace.\u201d It was a moment that resonated deeply as the country came to terms with a shocking crime. It was also a continuation of Obama\u2019s long public reckoning with race in America, which began well before he entered office. He detailed his upbringing in his first book, \u201cDreams from my Father,\u201d writing about searching for an identity as the son of a black Kenyan father and a white American mother, raised in Hawaii and Indonesia. Those identity questions have followed him to the White House, where his status as the first American-American president has brought with it oversized expectations for his ability to cure the nation\u2019s racial divides. Obama faces sharp repudiation and a legacy nightmare \u201cHe never ran to be the first black president. He ran to be the president of the United States and he happens to be black,\u201d said Axelrod. \u201cHe needed to become a force for healing, and finding the right way to do that was something that he wrestled with.\u201d That explanation hasn\u2019t always sat well with some prominent black leaders, who say Obama should have spoken more forcefully about the plight of black Americans. Obama responded by delving into law enforcement practices, creating commissions and issuing recommendations to police departments for how to treat suspects and handle volatile situations. He took steps to reverse the high rates of incarceration among African-American men, including granting clemency to hundreds of people convicted of non-violent drug crimes. And he instituted the My Brother\u2019s Keeper mentorship program for young black men, a mission he says he\u2019ll continue when he leaves office. But those efforts haven\u2019t improved Americans\u2019 view of race relations in the final days of Obama\u2019s presidency. A CNN/ORC survey in October showed 54% of Americans believe relations between blacks and whites have gotten worse since Obama became president. Fifty-seven percent of whites, and 40% of blacks, held that view. Trump\u2019s election isn\u2019t likely to improve matters. A Pew Research Center survey taken after November\u2019s election found nearly half of US voters believe race relations will worsen under Trump. Only 25% said they would improve. That\u2019s hardly surprising given the racially charged presidential election that Trump won. His opponents accused him of stoking racist fears during his \u201cbirther\u201d phase, which he falsely claimed had originated with Hillary Clinton. Speaking in July \u2013 as the campaign was entering a bitter stretch that included accusations of racist language \u2013 Obama described his own views of his racial legacy. \u201cMore than anything, what I hope is that my voice has tried to get all of us as Americans to understand the difficult legacy of race; to encourage people to listen to each other,\u201d he said during a news conference in Poland. \u201cThe legacy of slavery and Jim Crow and discrimination didn\u2019t suddenly vanish with the passage of the Civil Rights Act or the Voting Rights Act, or the election of Barack Obama,\u201d he said. \u201cThings have gotten better \u2013 substantially better \u2013 but we\u2019ve still got a lot more work to do.\u201d \u201cIf my voice has been true and positive, then my hope would be that it may not fix everything right away,\u201d he continued. \u201cThat\u2019s OK. We plant seeds, and somebody else maybe sits under the shade of the tree that we planted.  And I\u2019d like to think that, as best as I could, I have been true in speaking about these issues.\u201d CORRECTION: This story has been updated to accurately reflect the year in which Trayvon Martin was killed.",

President-elect Donald Trump this week tapped Carson to run the Department of Housing and Urban Development \u2013 the latest twist in an odd, on-again, off-again relationship between the two former Republican primary rivals. It will be the first-ever government job for Carson and put him in charge of a massive budget. Important policy decisions, including the integration of public housing outside of struggling, minority-dominated neighborhoods, will be in his hands. And Carson\u2019s previous public comments indicate he is deeply skeptical of the agency he would run. The lone qualification some Trump supporters offered was that Carson brought the first-hand experience of actually living in public housing as a child. Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee even said House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi was \u201cracist or just dumb\u201d for suggesting he wasn\u2019t up to the job, claiming on Twitter that Carson would be the first HUD secretary to have actually lived in public housing. Except it wasn\u2019t true. Close Carson friend Armstrong Williams \u2013 who had previously told reporters that the neurosurgeon had lived in public housing as a child \u2013 backtracked Tuesday morning. \u201cDr. Carson\u2019s mother worked 3 jobs at a time to keep them out of public housing, but he grew up around many who utilized housing programs,\u201d Williams tweeted Monday. It\u2019s the latest in a line of questions about Carson\u2019s childhood in southwest Detroit. What\u2019s clear: He grew up in a single-parent household with a mother who worked several jobs to make ends meet. They occasionally relied on public assistance, including food stamps, and made several moves before landing in what Carson has described as an \u201cupper-lower-class neighborhood.\u201d There, he began an improbable rise that led him to spend nearly three decades as director of pediatric neurosurgery at Johns Hopkins University. Carson wrote several books and inspired the Cuba Gooding Jr. movie \u201cGifted Hands.\u201d But he has also described a violent youth, fueled by anger. Carson told stories of attempted stabbings, brick-hurling, rock-throwing and more. He wrote in his \u201cGifted Hands\u201d autobiography that he\u2019d attempted to attack his own mother with a hammer in an argument over clothes. But nine friends, classmates and neighbors who grew up with Carson told CNN last year they have no memory of the anger or violence the candidate has described. Trump had ferociously mocked and ridiculed Carson over the stories about his youth while on the campaign trail. Trump once likened Carson to a child molester, said his anger was pathological and once even grabbed his own belt buckle to skewer Carson\u2019s claim that he attempted to stab someone once but was thwarted by hitting the person\u2019s belt. \u201cHow stupid are the people of Iowa? How stupid are the people of the country to believe this crap?\u201d Trump asked. With Ben Carson wanting to hit his mother on head with a hammer, stab a friend and Pyramids built for grain storage - don't people get it? That tension seems to be receding, as the bigger question becomes whether Carson is prepared to lead an agency with a budget of $45 billion and a staff of 9,000. Democrats have praised Carson as a brilliant brain surgeon, but said he has no experience with housing policy. \u201cI have serious concerns about Dr. Carson\u2019s lack of expertise and experience in dealing with housing issues,\u201d incoming Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said in a statement. \u201cSomeone who is as anti-government as him is a strange fit for Housing secretary, to say the least.\u201d Pelosi, meanwhile, called Carson \u201ca disconcerting and disturbingly unqualified choice.\u201d The Trump transition team didn\u2019t respond to a request for comment on this story. Vice President-elect Mike Pence touted Carson as a \u201cbrilliant man\u201d in an interview on \u201cFox and Friends\u201d Tuesday morning. \u201cHe\u2019s an extraordinarily humble man. He grew up in Detroit. He grew up in an urban environment and built a life story that\u2019s been an inspiration to millions of Americans. He\u2019s going to lead that agency with integrity, with great distinction,\u201d Pence said. But even Carson himself has questioned his ability to run massive government agency. \u201cDr. Carson feels he has no government experience, he\u2019s never run a federal agency. The last thing he would want to do was take a position that could cripple the presidency,\u201d Carson\u2019s friend Williams said shortly after the election amid intense speculation about a potential Cabinet pick \u2013 before Carson changed his mind and decided to enter the Trump administration. Neither Trump nor Carson has laid out specific plans or policy proposals for public housing. But the first casualty of Carson\u2019s installment at HUD could be a push under President Barack Obama to integrate public housing under the 1968 Fair Housing Act. Carson would have wide latitude to decide whether he agrees with the Obama administration that government should play a role in addressing the forces \u2013 from crumbling inner-city schools to limited access to transportation \u2013 that stem from segregated housing by pushing public housing outside poor, minority-dominated areas and toward wealthier neighborhoods. As a presidential candidate himself, Carson indicated he sides instead with Republicans who have decried the effort to require communities to assess patterns of income and racial discrimination in housing, as social engineering. Carson wrote in a 2015 Washington Times op-ed that the requirement would heap pressure on suburbs to abolish zoning rules that keep low-income apartment complexes from being built by limiting multifamily housing. That would, Carson wrote at the time, \u201cfundamentally change the nature of some communities from primarily single-family to largely apartment-based areas by encouraging municipalities to strike down housing ordinances that have no overtly (or even intended) discriminatory purpose \u2013 including race-neutral zoning restrictions on lot sizes and limits on multi-unit dwellings, all in the name of promoting diversity.\u201d \u201cThese government-engineered attempts to legislate racial equality create consequences that often make matters worse,\u201d Carson wrote. \u201cThere are reasonable ways to use housing policy to enhance the opportunities available to lower-income citizens, but based on the history of failed socialist experiments in this country, entrusting the government to get it right can prove downright dangerous.\u201d Meanwhile, Carson appeared to compare public housing to communism in a radio interview conservative host Jan Mickelson in the summer of 2015. Mickelson told Carson that eastern Iowans were being told that they \u201chave to recruit from Chicago their poverty-afflicted individuals to bring them to Iowa in order to qualify for Section 8 Housing.\u201d \u201cThis is just an example of what happens when we allow the government to infiltrate every part of our lives,\u201d Carson said. \u201cThis is what you see in communist countries where they have so many regulations encircling every aspect of your life that if you don\u2019t agree with them, all they have to do is pull the noose. And this is what we\u2019ve got now. \u201cEvery month dozens of regulations \u2013 business, industry, academia, every aspect of our lives \u2013 so that they can control you. And this is exactly what Thomas Jefferson predicted. He said the people would become lackadaisical, they would not be vigilant, the government would grow, it will infiltrate every part of their lives, and it will take over. \u201cBut just before \u2013 just before we become another type of government, the people would wake up. I\u2019m hoping that this is the time when they wake up.\u201d",

            "article_content": "The Supreme Court on Monday tackled two racial gerrymander cases in a fresh attempt to determine how race can be taken into consideration when states draw district lines. The justices heard arguments for more than two hours concerning maps in North Carolina and Virginia. In a sign of the complexity of the cases, the justices did something they don\u2019t usually do: They allowed the arguing attorneys to go on for extended periods of time without interruption. \u201cThis is all,\u201d Justice Samuel Alito said at one point, \u201cvery, very complicated.\u201d As is often the case, Justice Anthony Kennedy could prove to be a critical vote. At one point, he expressed reservation about a lower court opinion that went in favor of the Virginia plans. Monday\u2019s case represents another example of how the recent presidential election could profoundly impact the future of the Supreme Court. During the campaign, Hillary Clinton stressed the importance of voting rights and vowed to nominate a justice who would work to reverse the impact of Shelby County v. Texas, a 2013 5-4 decision that struck down a key provision of the Voting Rights Act. But Donald Trump is likely to replace the late Justice Antonin Scalia with a like-minded conservative. If Trump were to get the opportunity to fill a second seat, he could further solidify the Shelby majority. On Monday, civil rights groups and Democrats came to court to challenge plans they said unnecessarily packed African-Americans into districts with the aim of diluting minority presence in neighboring districts. Mark Elias, a lawyer challenging the plans who also served as Clinton\u2019s top election lawyer, said the maps were drawn to diminish minority voters\u2019 impact in electing candidates of their choice. But Paul Clement \u2014 a lawyer for the states \u2013 defended the plans, arguing that the states find themselves in a bind, often seeking a sweet spot between federal law and constitutional requirements. On the one hand, the Voting Rights Act requires that the legislature take race into consideration when drawing lines. At the same time, the court has said that the Equal Protection Clause prevents race from being the dominant factor in those decisions absent a compelling justification. Kennedy\u2019s comments suggested a discomfort with race being used as a tipping point without the proper scrutiny. \u201cI have a problem with that,\u201d he said at one point. In 2015, Kennedy voted with his liberal colleagues in a case out of Alabama concerning how districts could be drawn. But he also voted with the majority in Shelby County. The first case, Bethune Hill v. Virginia State Board of Elections, deals with a Virginia legislative map that was redrawn in 2010 after the census. Twelve districts for the State House of Delegates were drawn to attain a 55% Black Voting Age population. Critics argue that the maps pack African-Americans in the district and dilute their presence in other districts. A lower court upheld the districts, saying that race did not predominate in 11 of the 12 districts and in the 12th there was a permissible justification to have race predominate. The second case concerns two federal congressional district maps that were drawn in North Carolina to ensure that each had a Black Voting Age population of 50%. In that case, a lower court said the maps were unconstitutional. Allison Riggs, a lawyer for the Southern Coalition for Social Justice, who filed a brief in support of the challengers, rejected any argument that the states are caught between a rock and a hard place. \u201cThe reality is it is not difficult to comply with both the Voting Rights Act and the Constitution,\u201d she said. \u201cAll you need to do is avoid racial quotas and look at political realities on the ground in each district.\u201d",

He didn\u2019t impede anybody\u2019s ability to watch the games or come to the games or anything like that which is why I went on \u2018Good Morning America,\u2019 my show \u2018First Take\u2019 and other outlets to support him,\u201d he explained. However, after Kaepernick revealed that he had decided not to vote, Smith said he changed his mind about the sports star. \u201cI thought it compromised everything that he was standing for,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd more importantly I thought it was a disrespect to our ancestors, to people who have bled and fought and died for him to have the right to do that.\u201d As far as Smith is concerned, he emphasized, Kaepernick\u2019s lack of participation in the election had \u201cobliterated every argument he was trying to make.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not saying his arguments have no credence whatsoever\u201d he explained. \u201cI\u2019m saying that he himself compromised his own message and because of that I don\u2019t want to listen to him anymore because the number one tool that we have in America to provoke change is our power to vote. It\u2019s something that we fought for. It\u2019s something that was exacted to us in 1964/1965. How in god\u2019s name can you sit up there and justify not voting?\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not letting him get a pass on that,\u201d he added. \u201cI\u2019m just not.\u201d CNN reached out to the 49ers for comment on Smith\u2019s remarks Saturday, and representatives for the team pointed to comments Kaepernick made explaining his decision not to vote from November 15. \u201cI thought a lot of different things about the process and what I could and couldn\u2019t do,\u201d Kaepernick said at the time. \u201cOnce again, the system of oppression is what I have an issue with.\u201d",

            "article_content": "To see a full discussion between Kellyanne Conway and Robby Mook with CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper, watch CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d this Sunday at 9 a.m. ET. Donald Trump Campaign Manager Kellyanne Conway called members of Clinton's team \"bitter\" Joel Benenson pressed the Trump team to explain who their supporters want \"to take America back from\" Four weeks after the election, tensions between top operatives at the Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton campaigns erupted during a Harvard Kennedy School Institute of Politics discussion that was intended to record history by drawing out the internal deliberations of both campaigns. Facing off at long tables on opposite sides of the room during a two-hour panel, raw emotions on both sides exploded as operatives debated how Trump had won the divisive campaign. There were periods of calm, substantive discussion about data, metrics and target states, but many moments where tempers flared, with acrimony mirroring the 2016 race. Advisers on the opposing sides shouted over each other. Accusations of lying flew between them. There was lots of eye-rolling on both sides. Operatives snapped at one another for interrupting, as an air of mutual contempt settled within the room. Trump Campaign Manager Kellyanne Conway called members of Clinton\u2019s team \u201cbitter.\u201d \u201cHey guys, we won,\u201d Conway said at one point, challenging Clinton\u2019s team to \u201caccept the results of the election.\u201d \u201cHe was the better candidate. That\u2019s why we won.\u201d But the Clinton team did not back down. Chief Strategist Joel Benenson charged that the Trump campaign was successful, in part, by sending a series of \u201cdog whistles\u201d and messages with racial overtones that appealed to white voters who believed the government favored minorities. Benenson pressed the Trump team to explain exactly who their supporters want \u201cto take America back from.\u201d He disputed the Trump team\u2019s argument that his economic message led him to victory. Clinton won a majority of voters who were concerned about the economy, he said, while Trump won more voters who believe minorities are favored in this country. Clinton Senior Adviser Karen Finney added that Trump had tapped into \u201cunderlying cultural anxiety about change that we were not willing to do.\u201d In a key moment that flipped the initial tone from fairly civil to acrimonious, Clinton advisers Jennifer Palmeiri and Finney charged the Trump campaign with providing a platform for white supremacist views by hiring Breitbart Chief Executive Steve Bannon. The Trump team had elevated the so-called alt-right movement into the mainstream, they said, with Palmieri adding that Clinton\u2019s speech denouncing the extremist movement was the proudest moment of the campaign. \u201cAre you going look me in the face and say I provided a platform for white supremacists?\u201d Kellyanne Conway asked incredulously. Both Palmieri and Finney nodded and said \u201cyes.\u201d \u201cI would rather lose than win the way you did,\u201d Palmieri said. \u201cYou guys are pathetic,\u201d Trump adviser David Bossie replied, accusing them of a smear campaign against Bannon. Bossie argued that Clinton lost not because of headwinds, but because of distrust due to a long series of \u201cself-inflicted wounds\u201d dating back to the 1990s from the Whitewater scandal to the missing files at the Rose Law Firm. Bossie and Conway charged that the Clinton campaign was in denial about why their candidate had lost \u2013 in part their refusal to acknowledge that she was a \u201cbad candidate.\u201d Clinton adviser Mandy Grunwald said the Trump campaign had operated in the world of \u201cdark arts.\u201d As an example, she flashed the final issue of the National Enquirer, essentially describing Clinton as a corrupt criminal who should be thrown in jail. \u201cI don\u2019t think you guys give yourself enough credit for the negative campaign you ran,\u201d Grunwald said. \u201cI think it was an incredibly effective negative campaign, and you guys don\u2019t get credit for it.\u201d To the irritation of Trump officials, the Clinton team argued that the results have not given Trump a mandate to govern. At one point when Trump pollster Tony Fabrizio was saying that the Clinton campaign had failed to understand the fact that 70% of voters believed the country was on the wrong track, her Campaign Manager Robby Mook interrupted: \u201cWe won the popular vote.\u201d Over the course of the two-day conference, the Clinton team attributed their general election loss to a myriad of factors. They said they faced huge headwinds within the electorate because of the strong desire for change: \u201cWe underestimated the force of that wind of change,\u201d Mook said. But they focused repeatedly on what they viewed as the destructive impact of FBI Director James Comey\u2019s press conference and his two letters about the investigation into Clinton\u2019s emails on her private server. That hurt Clinton particularly among suburban women and younger voters in the final days, they said. Clinton advisers also blamed unfair media coverage \u2013 noting that it was a struggle every day to get Clinton\u2019s message to break through in a media environment dominated by Trump. There was also fierce criticism of the press by the Trump campaign. One of the odder complaints came from former Trump campaign manager Corey Lewandowski. \u201cThis is the problem with the media. You guys took everything Donald Trump said so literally,\u201d Lewandowski said. \u201cThe American people didn\u2019t. They understood it. They understood sometimes when you have a conversation with people, whether it\u2019s around the dinner table or at a bar, you\u2019re going to say things and sometimes you don\u2019t have all the facts to back it up.\u201d Several Clinton advisers also argued that there was an unfair \u201cdouble standard\u201d for Clinton within the press that was driven partly by her gender. Mook noted that the press often focused on how she delivered her message in a way that they would not have been scrutinized in a male candidate. \u201cShe\u2019s been an uncomfortable presence for a long time\u201d by breaking gender barriers, Palmieri said. When the Clinton team was asked whether they would have done anything differently, Palmieri said one mistake was not arguing for a fourth debate shortly before the election. When Clinton wasn\u2019t on stage with Trump, it was difficult for her message to break through, she said \u2013 setting up a dynamic of \u201cHillary versus Hillary.\u201d \u201cWhat hurt us was (the Trump campaign) coming after her or the press picking at us,\u201d Palmieri said. Clinton\u2019s advisers said they were harmed by Russians meddling in the election and the \u201cdrip, drip, drip\u201d of news about Hillary Clinton\u2019s emails, followed by the hacking of John Podesta\u2019s emails that revealed internal campaign deliberations. They also acknowledged that they did not perform as well as they needed to among younger voters; one key reason for that, they said, was Comey\u2019s interference in the election. \u201cUndecided voters didn\u2019t break our way,\u201d Mook said of Election Night. \u201cThat Comey letter had a huge effect,\u201d he said, calling it \u201cprobably a game-changer.\u201d Both Mook and Benenson said while the race was incredibly fluid in the final weeks, they were closely watching both Trump and Clinton defectors \u2013 voters who were considering third party candidates. In the final weeks before Election Day, they were coming home \u2013 first to Trump and then to Clinton. But the first Comey letter 11 days before the election stalled that movement back to Clinton, Benenson said. \u201cThose last 11 days we couldn\u2019t get them back,\u201d he said. Asked about the heated back-and-forths, White House Deputy Press Secretary Eric Schultz Friday said he was \u201cnot surprised\u201d that the program was \u201cparticularly\u201d feisty.\u201d Schultz added that he was also \u201cnot sure that\u2019s a bad thing,\u201d saying that it\u2019s important to look back at the decisions of a campaign. \u201cIt\u2019s ok to be candid and to honestly look back at the decisions you made, the decisions your opponent made and how that played out in the context of the race when you\u2019re not in the heat of it,\u201d Schultz said. Schultz also downplayed stark campaign trail rhetoric between Obama and Trump. \u201cI think that the President did speak out on the trail early and often about his profound differences with Mr. Trump,\u201d Schultz said. \u201cBut Mr. Trump won. He won the election on November 8th. The President has made clear that our priority in light of that election is to provide for a seamless transition of power.\u201d CNN\u2019s Allie Malloy contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "85% say that the nation is sharply split A slight majority want to end the Electoral College After a bruising presidential election featuring the two least liked major-party candidates in recent history, more than 8-in-10 Americans say the country is more deeply divided on major issues this year than in the past several years, according to a new CNN/ORC poll. And more than half say they are dissatisfied with the way democracy is working in the US. The poll\u2019s findings, released Sunday, also suggest a sizable minority personally agree with both parties on at least some issues, and nearly 8-in-10 overall hope to see the GOP-controlled government incorporate some Democratic policies into its agenda. Read the complete CNN/ORC poll results The public is evenly split on whether single-party control of government \u2013 with Republicans at the helm in both the White House and Congress \u2013 is good or bad for the country, with 49% on each side of that question. Almost 8-in-10, however, say the Republicans should make an effort to include Democratic policies in any legislation they pass rather than sticking to a GOP-driven agenda. And most say they would like to see President-elect Donald Trump, who won with an Electoral College majority despite trailing in the popular vote nationwide, pursue policies that could draw in new supporters rather than appeal solely to those who backed him during the campaign. Less than half, 40%, say that Trump\u2019s win means he has a mandate to pursue the agenda his supporters favor, while 53% say that since he didn\u2019t win the popular vote, he should get behind an agenda that might attract new supporters. Clinton to join recount that Trump calls 'scam' The push for bipartisanship is less intense than the last time a single party controlled both houses of Congress and the White House in 2008. The percentage in the CNN/ORC poll saying Republicans ought to incorporate Democratic policies into their agenda is lower than the percentage who thought the Democrats ought to do the same in 2008 when they took control of the White House and both houses of Congress. That\u2019s largely because Republicans now are less likely to think their party\u2019s leaders ought to work with the Democrats than Democrats were in 2008 to say that their leaders should bring in GOP policies (55% of Republicans say so now vs. 74% of Democrats who said so in \u201908). In the wake of a surprising election night loss, Democrats express greater dissatisfaction with the way democracy in the US is working than do Republicans (63% of Democrats are dissatisfied vs. 47% of Republicans), but some of the Republican Party\u2019s core supporters express deeper dissatisfaction than the GOP as a whole. Among white evangelicals, 60% say they are dissatisfied, 62% of rural Americans say the same, and whites without college degrees, a typically GOP-leaning group which broke heavily for Trump in the recent election, are broadly dissatisfied (61% vs. 52% among whites who hold college degrees). The sense that the country is sharply riven is near universal, with 85% saying so overall, including 86% of independents, 85% of Republicans and 84% of Democrats. It\u2019s also sharply higher than it was in 2000 when the nation last elected a president who did not win the popular vote (64% thought the nation more sharply split then). The share who see deeper divides now tops 8-in-10 across gender, racial, age and educational divides. The biggest difference on the question comes across ideological lines, with 91% of liberals saying the country is more divided on top issues compared with 80% of conservatives. Still, majorities of Americans say there are at least some issues where each party, the President-elect and the current president share their views. And there is some overlap in those groups across parties. About a third of Americans (34%) say there are at least some issues where both parties share their views, though only about a quarter say they personally agree with both Trump and President Barack Obama on at least some issues. Shared views with both parties are more common among independents (43% say they share at least some views with both Democrats and Republicans, vs. 28% of Democrats and 26% of Republicans who say they agree with the opposite party on at least some issues), among men (38% say so vs. 30% of women), and among younger Americans (40% under age 45 say so, vs. 28% among older Americans). Donald Trump's rise The public also is divided on the two top Republican leaders in Congress, with more holding favorable than unfavorable views of House Speaker Paul Ryan (47% see him favorably, 35% unfavorably), but tilting the other way on Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (39% see him unfavorably, 25% favorably). Both are viewed positively among Republicans, with Ryan outpacing McConnell by 8 points (48% view Ryan favorably, 40% McConnell). Findings from the same poll released last week found that the President-elect holds a 47% favorability rating overall, with 50% viewing him unfavorably. Looking back on the election, about half (51%) say the US ought to amend the Constitution so that presidents are elected via popular vote rather than the Electoral College, but 44% would prefer to keep the current system. Support for the status quo is higher than it was in 2000, when the nation last elected a president who did not win the popular vote. At that time, 37% said the Electoral College should stay and 59% favored changing the rules. And what of the popular vote winner? Americans\u2019 views of Hillary Clinton haven\u2019t softened post election. Overall, 40% say they have a favorable view of Clinton, and 57% unfavorable. That is her lowest favorability rating since immediately after the GOP convention, and represents the second lowest since her husband was elected president in 1992. Among Democrats, Clinton\u2019s favorability rating stands at 79%, down from 86% in late October. The CNN/ORC Poll was conducted November 17-20 among a random national sample of 1,003 adults. Results for the full sample have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3 percentage points.",

            "article_content": "President Barack Obama called for unity in his final Thanksgiving address Thursday, just weeks after what he called the \u201csometimes divisive campaign\u201d came to a close. \u201cAs a country, we\u2019ve just emerged from a noisy, passionate, and sometimes divisive campaign season,\u201d Obama said in his weekly address. \u201cAfter all, elections are often where we emphasize what sets us apart. We face off in a contest of \u2018us\u2019 versus \u2018them.\u2019 We focus on the candidate we support instead of some of the ideals we share \u2026 But a few short weeks later, Thanksgiving reminds us that no matter our differences, we are still one people, part of something bigger than ourselves.\u201d Obama made nine phone calls to service members Thursday morning to thank them for their service. For his part, President-elect Donald Trump, in his holiday message released yesterday, called for national unity as well and he vowed to bring the country together in common purpose. But the wounds from the election are still fresh and liberal leaders are seeking recounts of the vote in three states \u2013 Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin \u2013 and some Democratic members of the Electoral College also have launched a last-ditch attempt to block Trump. Protests have peppered the nation since the election amid reports hate crimes have spiked. A gathering of white nationalists and self-described \u201calt-right\u201d leaders celebrating Trump\u2019s victory last weekend turned violent as protesters clashed with them and some supporters gave the Nazi salute. Obama hinted at the racial strife in his message Thursday. \u201cNever doubt, that is what makes us American \u2013 not where we come from, what we look like, or what faith we practice, but the ideals to which we pledge our allegiance. It\u2019s about our capacity to live up to the creed as old as our founding: \u201cE Pluribus Unum\u201d - that out of many, we are one,\u201d he said. In a Thursday afternoon tweet, the President emphasized a unifying message. \u201cThis Thanksgiving, we give thanks for our blessings, and work to fulfill the timeless responsibility we have as Americans to serve others.\u201d This Thanksgiving, we give thanks for our blessings, and work to fulfill the timeless responsibility we have as Americans to serve others. And in a Facebook post Obama reflected on spending Thanksgivings in the White House, the commander in chief\u2019s residence that he\u2019ll be turning over to Trump on January 20. \u201cFor me, this house has served as the backdrop to the tough decisions and trying times that often characterize the Presidency. But it\u2019s also been home \u2013 it\u2019s where Michelle and I have watched our daughters grow into the funny, smart, humble, and extraordinary young women they are today.\u201d The White House also provided the official first family Thanksgiving dinner menu. Featured menu items included thyme roasted turkey, along with prime rib and creamed horseradish.",

            "article_content": "Reid made his opening statement as the Senate convened Tuesday Reid's speech came the first day the Senate was back to work for its post-election lame-duck session Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid led a Democratic assault Tuesday against President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s appointment of Steve Bannon as his chief White House adviser, arguing Bannon is linked to white nationalists and has supported anti-Semitic, anti-Muslim and anti-women views that should disqualify him. \u201cAs long as a champion of racial division is a step away from the Oval Office, it would be impossible to take Trump\u2019s efforts to heal the nation seriously,\u201d said Reid in an impassioned floor speech. Reid called on Trump to rescind his job offer to the former Breitbart News chief who was the CEO of Trump\u2019s insurgent campaign. \u201cRise to the dignity of the office of the president of the United States. Instead of hiding behind your Twitter account, and show America that racism, bullying and bigotry have no place in the White House or in America,\u201d he said. Reid argued that Trump\u2019s election had triggered a spree of hate crimes in the country by people emboldened by Trump\u2019s election. \u201cWe have a responsibility to prevent Trump\u2019s bullying and aggressive behavior from becoming normalized in the eyes of America,\u201d said Reid, who is retiring at the end of the year. \u201cWe have a responsibility to say it is not normal for the KKK, the Ku Klux Klan, to celebrate the election of a president they view as their champion with a victory parade.\u201d The No. 2 Senate Republican fired back at Reid for undermining Trump and Bannon and not giving them a chance. \u201cHe does nothing to contribute to the healing of our country after a very polarizing, hotly contested election by continuing to pile of the President-elect and his team,\u201d Sen. John Cornyn of Texas said. \u201cWe had an election. The American people voted. The American people chose their next president.\u201d Speaking to reporters Wednesday, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said he would not comment on White House appointments. Reid\u2019s late-afternoon floor speech came the first day the Senate was back to work for its post-election lame-duck session. He was one of many Democrats who spoke out against Bannon. Sen. Jeff Merkley, D-Oregon, led a news conference in the Capitol with four other Democrats next to a sign that read \u201cFire Bannon.\u201d Sen. Dianne Feinstein, D-California, was one of several Democrats issuing statements against the appointment. She warned that many minority communities were fearful of a Trump presidency even before he picked Bannon. \u201cHiring Steve Bannon as a senior adviser in the White House will only further inflame these fears,\u201d she said. \u201cVirtually everyone who has contacted my office has expressed shock that Bannon, so closely linked to anti-Semitic and misogynistic opinions, will have the ear of the president.\u201d Republicans appeared more supportive. Sen. Rand Paul, R-Kentucky, said Democrats were being \u201csour grapes\u201d because they lost the election and he hadn\u2019t seen anything about Bannon that was problematic. \u201cI think there are a lot of sour grapes out there. After people lose the election, they are pointing fingers trying to make him into a caricature. I\u2019ve met him. I don\u2019t think he\u2019s a caricature of any of those horrible things the left is trying to bring out about him. I don\u2019t believe him to be a racist,\u201d Paul told CNN. South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham told reporters he has not met Bannon but noted the Republican Jewish Coalition is supporting him, so will wait to make a decision. Graham did say, however, that he is not a fan of the \u201calt-right.\u201d \u201cI will say this, the website in question was a friendly site to the alt-right. I don\u2019t like them and they don\u2019t like me, and I\u2019m glad,\u201d Graham said. Democrats can complain about Bannon\u2019s new job but there\u2019s little they can do about it. For one thing, the position does not require Senate confirmation. CNN\u2019s Tom LoBianco and Manu Raju contributed to this report.",

If Ellison is elected DNC chair, he could play a potentially powerful role in advocating for ethnic minority groups, including Muslims, who feel deeply concerned about Trump\u2019s past comments about non-whites. Earlier this year, CNN traveled to three growing Muslim communities and spoke to more than 40 Muslim Americans about the election. In these conversations, the community expressed emotions ranging from disbelief to anger to fear. In an extensive interview outside of his district office in Minneapolis, Ellison said at the time that Muslims in his community feared possible backlash and spike in racial discrimination if Trump were to be elected president. \u201cI\u2019ve had more than one mom say, \u2018My kids are asking me whether we\u2019re going to be deported, whether we\u2019re going to be safe.\u2019 Teenage girls asking whether they should wear the hijab if they want to,\u201d Ellison said. \u201cIt\u2019s a choice, but they\u2019re now getting the message that maybe it\u2019s not safe for them to do that.\u201d Like many others that CNN interviewed, Ellison also made a surprising revelation: that he believes things are worse now for Muslim-Americans than they were right after the September 11 terrorist attacks. \u201cI think it\u2019s probably harder now,\u201d he said. Ellison described a gradual easing of tensions and normalization in the 15 years since 9/11. After becoming the first Muslim-American elected to Congress, Ellison said former President George W. Bush \u201cextended his hand to me and said, \u2018Ellison, I\u2019m glad there\u2019s a Muslim in the Congress.\u2019\u201d Bush \u201cstood with Muslims and he said that Islam\u2019s not the problem \u2013 these terrorists, murderers and maniacs are the problem,\u201d Ellison says. \u201cGeorge Bush doesn\u2019t get enough credit for that.\u201d",

            "article_content": "John Roberts has a chance to lead a conservative Supreme Court once again Chief Justice John Roberts is about to get the Supreme Court back. And it could be even better for him over the next four years. Tuesday\u2019s election of Donald Trump as president of the United States will not only secure a conservative majority and preserve recent rulings, for example, against campaign finance regulation and for individual gun rights. It could eventually mean a rollback of liberal precedents for abortion rights, campus affirmative action, and protections based on sexual orientation. As with so much in the wake of Tuesday\u2019s election, expectations for the Supreme Court and law of the land turned upside down as the results came in. Last February, when Justice Antonin Scalia died, for the first time in decades the Republican court appointees no longer held a majority. Democratic President Barack Obama, or a like-minded successor, appeared ready to fill the vacancy. The Supreme Court was on the cusp of a historic reversal, and Roberts, the man with a golden resume, who when appointed in 2005 at age 50 was the youngest chief since John Marshall in 1801, seemed to face the greatest challenge of his life in the law. Obama nominated Merrick Garland, a respected moderate liberal and former prosecutor who is chief judge on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Republican Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell blocked Senate action on Garland, insisting that the open seat should be filled not by Obama but by whoever won this election \u2013 a line he drew within an hour of the announcement of Scalia\u2019s death. Obama had nearly a year left in his White House term at that moment, and given the tenor of the presidential race most of the year, installing a liberal on the court seemed just a matter of timing. As late as Monday, there was even discussion among Senate Democrats and some Republicans over whether Garland would see a vote in the lame duck Senate before Hillary Clinton had a chance to nominate a more liberal justice. Meanwhile, the Supreme Court of four conservatives and four liberals was in a holding pattern, deciding as little as possible and deadlocked on the most contentious issues. Roberts was waiting it out, engaging in modest negotiations, giving up little and watching for the political situation to clarify. Now it is clear that Trump, backed by a still-Republican Senate, will choose the next justices. His first appointee would likely have the same conservative ideology as Scalia and the 5-to-4 polarization that defined the Roberts Court in his first decade is likely to continue. But more than that, if any of the older liberal justices retire, Trump could deepen the conservative cast for years to come. Senior liberal justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg is 83. The next most senior justice on the left is 78-year-old Stephen Breyer. Justice Anthony Kennedy, who is generally in the conservative camp but joined with liberals to declare a right to gay marriage in 2015 and affirm abortion rights and campus affirmative action earlier this year, is 80. With those ages, as Ginsburg herself has said, the court could experience significant change in the next four years. Justices are appointed for life, and a president\u2019s legacy for federal courts at all levels endures long after he leaves office. Roberts, 61 and a student of history who considered earning a PhD at Harvard before turning to law school there, knows well the evolution of the Supreme Court he inherited in 2005. Its scaffolding traces back nearly a half century, when liberal groundbreaker Chief Justice Earl Warren retired in 1969 and newly elected Republican President Richard Nixon replaced him with Warren Burger. Then Nixon and a succession of Republican presidents filled most of the vacancies that arose through the years. Of the 16 new justices since 1969, 12 were Republican appointees, four Democratic, not counting William Rehnquist\u2019s elevation in 1986 from associate justice to chief. When President George W. Bush named Roberts to the center chair, Roberts had a ready-made majority for the conservatism he had embraced since he was a young lawyer in the Ronald Reagan administration in the 1980s. Under Roberts\u2019 leadership, the court curtailed the protections of the 1965 Voting Rights Act and other racial remedies, allowed more religion inpublic places, and restricted class-action lawsuits against corporate America. His one significant departure from the conservative agenda came when he voted to uphold Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act. Roberts was vilified by some Republicans for endorsing Obamacare, something Trump and other GOP candidates constantly reminded their base in the primaries. That aside, the four liberal justices routinely protested the majority\u2019s rightward direction. In 2007, when the conservative bloc rejected school integration policies in Seattle and Louisville, Breyer said, \u201cIt is not often in the law that so few have so quickly changed so much.\u201d More controversial rulings were yet to come. Two that arguably most mark this bench in the public mind are 2010 Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission, which brought more corporate money into political campaigns, and 2013 Shelby County v. Holder, which scaled back voter protections, particularly in regions with a history of race discrimination. As Clinton campaigned across the country against Trump, she and her Democratic supporters vowed to try to roll back those decisions. Tuesday\u2019s results instead deeply secure them and likely guarantee Roberts the legacy he sought from the start.",

            "article_content": "The transformation of Donald Trump begins Thursday. The freewheeling, acerbic, often vulgar and offensive maverick of the campaign trail has 70 days to become a president. Trump will begin the process with a remarkable meeting with President Barack Obama at the White House, an encounter between antagonists who never bothered to hide their visceral dislike for one another. After his stunning election victory over Hillary Clinton, Trump also has a dizzying list of tasks to fulfill, and the White House meeting is only the start of his hectic agenda before Inauguration Day. First, the President-elect must make a stab at uniting the country, after a scorched-earth campaign in which he consciously tore at the nation\u2019s gender, racial and economic fault lines to build a movement to win power. He\u2019s practicing some unusual humility. \u201cI pledge to every citizen of our lands that I will be the president for the American people,\u201d Trump said in his victory speech Tuesday. \u201cFor those who have chosen not to support me in the past, for which there were a few people, I\u2019m reaching out to you for your guidance and your help so we can work together and unify our great country.\u201d But his challenges were on clear display Wednesday as protests broke out from Boston to Los Angeles. Trump\u2019s meeting with Obama promises to be one of the most awkward encounters ever between a president and his successor. The President-elect\u2019s agenda is diametrically opposed to Obama, including the repeal of his signature health care law. Obama faces sharp repudiation and a legacy nightmare Trump built his political career and appeal to what eventually became his base with his crusade to prove that Obama was not a natural born citizen and was not therefore eligible for the presidency. Many Democrats found his antics racist and deeply offensive to the first African-American president. Partly spurred by his contempt for Trump, Obama used the power of his office like no other president before him to make the case on the campaign trail that his potential successor was essentially un-American, unfit for the presidency and too risky to be trusted with the nuclear codes. \u201cThe president made a forceful argument and he stands by that argument, but the time for making that argument has passed,\u201d White House spokesman Josh Earnest said Wednesday. \u201cThe American people rendered their judgment, and President Obama doesn\u2019t get to choose his successor, the American people do, and they did.\u201d Obama faces sharp repudiation and a legacy nightmare Preserving the integrity of American democracy makes it incumbent on Obama to ensure the peaceful transition of power, despite his own deep reservations and antipathy toward his successor. Trump is also under immediate pressure to build a relationship with Republican leaders, including House Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority leader Mitch McConnell, who have often viewed him with deep skepticism but are now crucial to his agenda . Trump must build an administration that is ready to hit the ground running January 20. And perhaps his most daunting assignment is building a national security structure from scratch, and bringing his own sketchy foreign policy and national security credentials up to speed. Every president who walks into the Oval Office faces an adjustment to the inhuman demands of the presidency. Obama is fond of saying that only problems that no one else can solve reach the President\u2019s desk. How Donald Trump won Donald Trump's America But Trump is the only man ever to win the presidency with no political, diplomatic or military executive experience, so his learning curve to becoming the most powerful man in the world will be even steeper. Trump is no longer on the campaign trail and is not therefore subject to the same pressures that a candidate faces. So in a sense, the transition allows him to reset and at least attempt to adopt a more presidential posture. His task will be exacerbated by the fact that he appears on track to lose the popular vote to Clinton, even though he won the electoral college \u2013 a factor that undercuts any claims of a mandate. Clinton\u2019s 2008 campaign manager Patti Solis Doyle, a CNN contributor, said Trump needs to make amends to Americans insulted by his conduct \u2013 including African-Americans, women and Hispanics. \u201cI think he needs to start with an apology \u2014 honestly,\u201d she said on CNN\u2019s \u201cThe Lead.\u201d Given the President-elect\u2019s reluctance to admit he is wrong, that step at least seems unlikely. Trump\u2019s new audience stretches beyond Washington and the United States. US allies were alarmed by Trump\u2019s victory, given his criticism of US alliances overseas and hazy knowledge of defense and nuclear doctrine. Adversaries like Russia and China will already be gaming out how best they can take advantage of their inexperienced new counterpart in Washington. How Republicans scrambled to hold the Senate While Trump has the advantage of a ready-made domestic program given Republican control of Congress, he has no such luxury when it comes to national security policy. Trump\u2019s foreign policy team also lacks a diplomatic heavy hitter respected abroad: speculation is mounting that he will bring in someone who is a known quantity overseas as Secretary of State \u2014 someone like Sen. Bob Corker, who heads the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. He has just over two months to staff the State Department, Pentagon, his White House National Security staff, install new leadership at the Intelligence Agencies and begin to install top diplomatic envoys overseas. It would be a daunting task for any president. Trump is further handicapped by the fact that a huge chunk of the Republican national security establishment, alarmed by his volatile temperament and rudimentary knowledge, defected en masse to Clinton. But the most fundamental question facing Trump may be his own temperament. World resigned, but wary of unpredictable Donald Trump The idea that the President-elect was too erratic and volatile to be commander-in-chief was at the center of Clinton\u2019s campaign, and many Americans and foreigners alike worry that his inauguration will usher in a period full of danger and risks. Who could be in the Trump administration? Trump showed at times on the campaign trail that he could be disciplined. Such a demeanor will be even more crucial now because a stray word from a president who can send financial markets tumbling or send foreign armies onto red alert. The transition period will be a time for him to try on his new role as a statesman. The question is whether he will be the version of Trump who vowed to throw Clinton in jail or someone with a personality more becoming of a commander in chief. \u201cIs this the Donald Trump who wanted to ban all Muslims coming into America?\u201d CNN contributor Matt Lewis, a conservative author, said on CNN Wednesday. \u201cOr is this the Donald Trump that sounded a much more conciliatory last night? He added: \u201cI hope that he was sort of fronting a little bit to win the election and that he will actually govern in a more statesmanlike manner.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Thirty-one percent of eligible voters will be racial or ethnic minorities It's a stark reminder of the shifting demographics of the country Barack Obama was catapulted into office eight years ago by what was, at the time, the most diverse electorate in history. The Americans who head to the polls to cast ballots for his successor are even more diverse.  Thirty-one percent of eligible voters will be racial or ethnic minorities, up from 29% in 2012, according to the Pew Research Center. And the share of non-Hispanic white voters eligible to vote will be the lowest in history, the continuation of a steady decline in white voters over the past three decades. It\u2019s a stark reminder of the shifting demographics of the country: The Census Bureau projects that no one racial group will be a majority of the country by the year 2044. Republicans and Democrats looking to chart an electoral future as the country continues to grow browner and younger will have to take heed of these shifts. CNN partnered with the Kaiser Family Foundation this year to look more specifically at the view of white, working class Americans. In the 1980 presidential election, white voters made up 88% of the electorate. That year, Ronald Reagan won 56% of non-Hispanic whites and captured the presidential election in a landslide. Four years later, against Walter Mondale, Reagan won them by 30 points, 66% to 34%. Since Reagan\u2019s time though, the white share of the electorate has declined by a few percentage points each presidential year. Fast forward to 2012. Mitt Romney won a slightly larger share of non-Hispanic white voters \u201359%\u2013 than Reagan did in his first term \u2013 but lost the presidential race. Why? The share of the white vote was smaller \u2013 72% \u2013 and Obama crushed Romney with non-white voters. Most estimates suggest the white vote this year will be around 69%, an all-time low and a three percentage point decline in four years. That difference is more pronounced in a number of states that both candidates are targeting, including Pennsylvania, Ohio, Florida and North Carolina. All have eligible voting populations that are slightly less white than four years ago. One reason is because overall, the white population in the United States is growing older and the younger generations of Americans are increasingly diverse, fueled largely by the growth of the Latino population in the US. The pool of eligible voters follows along the same lines: According to an analysis by the Pew Research Center, non-Hispanic whites account for 76% of all eligible voters who died between 2012 and 2016. Racial and ethnic minorities account for 43% of the new eligible voters born in the US that turned 18. As recently as 1996, white voters turned out at a higher rate than any other racial or ethnic group. But in 2012, the black voter turnout rate exceeded the white voter turnout rate, 66.2% to 64.1%. But not all ethnic groups vote at such levels. While white voter turnout has decreased, Latinos and Asians have historically lagged behind both black voters and white voters. In 2012, 48% of eligible Latinos and 48% of eligible Asian voters cast ballots.",

The drivers of the CNN #MyVote camper, Al James and Drew Burke, both grew up in the St. Louis area: James, who is black, grew up on the city\u2019s north side; Drew, who is white, lived in the suburbs across the river from St. Louis County. While both men live in the same region, they had very different experiences and perceptions of the city. The video tells their stories. Two neighborhoods in St. Louis each tell a very different story about politics Al James' lives in an area known as Jeff-Vander-Lou while Drew Burke lives in St. Charles Al James\u2019 neighborhood on the north side of St. Louis is known as Jeff-Vander-Lou, named after great men like Thomas Jefferson and Peter Lewis Vandeventer. Today residents refer to it as JVL \u2013 Just Vacant Lots. \u201cThere were a lot of companies around here at one point in time that had a lot of jobs,\u201d James said. \u201cThey are not fixing the neighborhood back up. People are moving out, and you have a lot of vacant houses.\u201d Al James looks back on his childhood fondly, but admits times have changed. He\u2019s looking for a presidential candidate that will bring it back to its better years. \u201cI am going to vote for Hillary,\u201d James said. \u201cShe has education on her mind for helping the youth, and what she\u2019s trying to propose, that will help the country.\u201d JVL is a predominantly black neighborhood with sections of low-income housing. In just the last year vacancies are up 22% in the area, according to real estate data firm, ATTOM Data Solutions. It\u2019s just a 20-minute drive from Ferguson where two years ago people rioted in the streets against police after the death of Michael Brown. Those riots created racial tension and divided parts of the city. \u201cWhen I was growing, most of the cops were friends,\u201d recalled James. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t until we got to high school that it all started to change. I know they\u2019re not from here. Most of the cops that patrol this area now are white cops.\u201d James remembers his days spent at the Gamble Community Center where he\u2019d play from morning until night. \u201cGrowing up here families looked out for each other,\u201d said James standing in front the community center. \u201cIf I was down here and something happened to me before I get back down to my house, my grandmother already knew about it. Now it\u2019s every man for themselves. Every family for themselves.\u201d James admits there are some things Clinton has done that he doesn\u2019t agree with. But what\u2019s most important is a candidate that could handle another situation like Ferguson. \u201cDonald\u2019s not the type of person because if the blacks are out and they are upset he will be ready to say, \u2018Lets send the Marines in there. Let\u2019s take them all out,\u2019\u201d James said. James lives just five minutes from his childhood home. He hopes his vote for Clinton helps turn the \u201cjust vacant lots\u201d into booming businesses again. \u201cI love my community and my neighborhood,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat\u2019s left of it.\u201d Separated from St. Louis by the Missouri River, the town of St. Charles, Missouri, where Drew Burke spent his childhood, feels a world away from James\u2019 neighborhood. With freshly manicured lawns dot the tree-lined streets near Francis Howell North High School, where Burke went to school. \u201cIt\u2019s a whitewashed area. Not a lot of diversity,\u201d Burke said as he drove the streets near his childhood home. \u201cIf there were a dozen [students of color] in my graduating class, I would be surprised.\u201d While parts of St. Louis rioted in the aftermath of the death of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Burke and his neighbors were largely insulated from the turmoil. The Missouri River, he said, can act as a dividing barrier between the two communities. \u201cThere is perception among some residents in this county that there is a very different culture on the other side of the river,\u201d he said. Doing business in the St. Louis area, Berke has had few interactions with police whenever he travels around town for his job. But James described an entirely different experience on a day to day basis. He avoids neighborhoods like Burke\u2019s. \u201cI hardly ever go to his side of town. For the most I don\u2019t go out there because I get profiled,\u201d James said. \u201cI\u2019m going to get pulled over. So I just choose not to go out there. I stay away from it. I will go 30 minutes out of my way just so i don\u2019t have to go through a certain municipality.\u201d Carefully planning a route just to avoid certain areas because of police is not something that Burke \u2013 and many other white Americans \u2013 have ever had to even consider. Burke said that in some cases, he feels like he gets a pass. \u201cThere are certain neighborhoods in St. Louis where if I rolled a stop sign and the cops saw that I was white in a predominantly black neighborhood, they would not pull me over,\u201d he said. On the road together, Burke and James have had a lot of time to talk. They trade stories about St. Louis, the neighborhoods where they grew up and where they still live today. And of course, they discuss the presidential election. They both see the election is divisive, but hope for the best after November. \u201cWhat would make this country great in my eyes,\u201d said James, \u201cis just everybody getting along.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Democrats have filed pre-emptive lawsuits against the GOP in Pennsylvania, Ohio and Nevada As Democrats warn their supporters of voter suppression efforts and Donald Trump urges his followers to watch polling areas, lawyers from both sides are filing fiery legal briefs and laying the groundwork for potential challenges on Election Day. In states such as Ohio, Pennsylvania, Arizona and Nevada, lawyers for state Democratic parties are in federal court alleging that the Trump campaign and others are \u201cconspiring to threaten, intimidate, and thereby prevent minority voters in urban neighborhoods from voting in the 2016 campaign.\u201d They are asking for a temporary injunction to block \u201csuch conduct\u201d through Election Day. In legal briefs, they quote Trump from a speech last August. \u201cI hope you people can\u2026not just vote on the 8th, [but also] go around and look and watch other polling places and make sure that it\u2019s 100-percent fine,\u201d Trump told an audience in Pennsylvania. \u201cImmediate relief is necessary,\u201d Donald J. McTigue, a lawyer for the Ohio Democratic Party argued in court papers filed in the Ohio case. McTigue said that the defendants\u2019 including the Trump campaign, the Ohio Republican Party and Trump supporters are engaged in a \u201ccoordinated campaign of vigilante voter intimidation\u201d and in violation of the Ku Klux Klan Act of 1871 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. Judge rejects GOP attempt to liberalize Pennsylvania poll-watcher law For McTigue, the stakes are high. \u201cThere are only nine days left until Election Day, and early in-person voting in Ohio is well underway,\u201d he argued. \u201cThe Ohio Democratic Party, and untold numbers of Ohio voters, will suffer irreparable harm if the right to vote is imperiled by voter suppression and intimidation.\u201d Election law expert Edward B. Foley of the Ohio State University Moritz College of Law, says lawsuits filed before the election can have a specific strategy. \u201cLawsuits filed now to thwart intimidation at the polls on Election Day have a kind of \u2018table-setting\u2019 function,\u201d he said. Foley said the goal is to get a case on a judge\u2019s docket ahead of time, in case lawyers have to go back to the judge quickly for an emergency order. \u201cThey also put the named defendants on notice that if they actually engage in activities that might constitute unlawful intimidation, then those defendants are potentially subject to contempt-of-court sanctions\u201d he said. Trump lawyers are firing back. \u201cIntimidating voters is illegal, and the Campaign does not remotely condone such conduct,\u201d Trump campaign lawyer Chad A. Readler of Jones Day wrote a 15-page legal filing in Ohio. \u201cThis case is one of four coordinated attacks across the country that are clearly long-planned efforts to sow chaos in the Defendants\u2019 political efforts, while garnering maximum publicity for Plaintiff\u2019s unsubstantiated, inflammatory claims on the eve of the Presidential Election,\u201d he wrote. Readler, argued that \u201crattling off a litany of alleged statements and actions by various putative \u2018Trump supporters\u2019 and other sundry third parties at various times in different locales simply does not, as a matter of law, establish a conspiracy by the Campaign to engage in voter suppression.\u201d And he said there is no \u201carticulable evidence\u201d that the Campaign\u2019s alleged statements and actions are the product of \u201cracial animus.\u201d \u201cIndeed, the Complaint asserts that the Campaign\u2019s alleged comments encouraging citizens to serve as poll observers \u2018are consistently directed at Democratic-leaning communities with large minority populations\u2019, which conflates a vital distinction between a putative racial motivation and a partisan motivation.\u201d Regarding Trump\u2019s comments concerning poll watchers Readler argued, \u201cCandidates are perfectly within their rights to encourage their supporters to serve as poll watchers,\u201d Readler said. \u201cSupporters of opposing candidates are perfectly within their rights to debate whether an election is at risk of being \u2018rigged\u2019 because of voter fraud,\u201d he added. Federal judge wants GOP to hand over info on poll watchers He also warned if the Democrats won an injunction it might reach \u201call sorts of innocuous, entirely legal conduct \u2013 such as protesting against a candidate on a sidewalk several hundred feet from a polling place.\u201d That, Readler warned, might have First Amendment implications. \u201cPlaintiff\u2019s sweeping request for relief thus runs roughshod over the First Amendment.\u201d A hearing in the Ohio case is scheduled for Friday.",

            "article_content": "More than 30 million votes have been cast already across 38 states with early voting Here's a look at the early voting data from several battleground states Democrats are building an early voting lead in North Carolina and Nevada, but Republicans maintain an edge in Florida and Ohio, according to a CNN analysis. With five days to go, registered Republicans also lead Democrats in early voting in Arizona, while Democrats are also ahead in Colorado and Iowa. More than 30 million votes have been cast already across 38 states with early voting. And with five days to go, both Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump are encouraging their supporters to hit the polls early. So far, about 7.4 million registered Democrats and about 6.4 million Republicans have done just that. CNN has partnered with Catalist, a data company that works with progressive candidates and groups, to receive detailed early vote return information this year. Catalist\u2019s voter list connects returned ballots with demographic and registration information, such as party registration, gender and age, and allows a closer look at who has already cast a vote. These are not results \u2013 ballots aren\u2019t counted until Election Day. But the findings provide clues on who is voting and which party is turning out to vote. And in states that track party affiliation, it\u2019s important to remember that not all Democrats are voting for Clinton, and not all Republicans support Trump. Here\u2019s a look at the early voting data from several battleground states: There\u2019s good news for both parties in Arizona, where about 1.3 million people have already voted. Registered Republicans are ahead right now \u2013 they lead by about 71,000 votes or 5.5%. But at this point four years ago, the GOP had a 10% advantage over Democrats. Perhaps sensing an opening, the Clinton campaign decided this week to pump an additional $1 million into Arizona for TV ads. But the good news for Republicans here is that it appears they\u2019re gaining ground. One week ago, their lead over Democrats was only about 11,500. Today that lead is more than 71,000. In Arizona, about 2 in 3 votes were cast early in 2012. Colorado is a state where the election is almost entirely conducted by mail. And with voting underway, there is good news for Democrats: They\u2019ve consistently led Republicans in terms of ballots returned. Today, they\u2019re ahead by more than 18,500 votes, or about 1.5%. Four years ago at this point, Republicans had a lead of more than 33,000 votes, or about 3%. That is a significant flip. But there are some new polls out of Colorado that show a tightening race, and there are some indications in the early voting numbers to back that up. The Democratic lead one week ago was about 5.6%. That narrowed to about 2.4% on Tuesday and stands at 1.5% today. Republicans have been steadily ahead in the early vote by about 0.5% over the past week. Maybe that\u2019s why President Barack Obama rallied voters Thursday in Miami and Jacksonville, hoping to turn things around. The GOP lead is tiny \u2013 it\u2019s only about 16,000 votes out of more than 2.7 million cast \u2013 but it\u2019s a strong sign for Republicans because at this point in 2008, they trailed Democrats by more than 73,000 votes. Turnout increased across the board, but it rose at difference paces for different racial groups. Latinos had the largest spike in terms of raw votes, boosting their turnout by 129% from 2008. White voters increased their turnout by 55%. And even though African-American turnout is up by 24%, that is clearly a slower growth rate than the other racial groups, and their share of the electorate dropped from 2008. What does this mean? For Democrats to win, they\u2019re likely hoping the big gains among Latino voters are enough to overcome whatever drop-off there is in the African-American vote. Democrats lead Republicans in Iowa, but they\u2019ve been consistently behind their winning 2012 pace. Right now, about 41,000 more Democrats than Republicans have voted in the Hawkeye State. But at this point four years ago, they had an edge of more than 60,000 votes. According to the data, their advantage is shrinking as Election Day draws closer, but this also happened in 2012, when Obama won. All that being said, a majority of voters in Iowa typically cast their ballots on Election Day. The early vote in Nevada has tracked closely with 2012, a year when Democrats built a significant lead during the early voting window. Obama relied on that lead to help him carry the state on Election Day. Registered Democrats are ahead by about 29,000 votes right now over registered Republicans. That\u2019s a slight drop from the 31,000-vote lead they had on Tuesday. But their lead is larger today than it was one week ago. Four years ago at this time, Democrats were ahead by about 38,000 votes, or 7.6%. The early vote is crucial in Nevada: Almost 70% of votes came early in 2012. Democrats are padding their lead in North Carolina, consistently increasing their raw vote advantage over Republicans as more early voting locations open across the Tar Heel State. Right now, registered Democrats are ahead by about 243,000 votes statewide. That\u2019s an impressive showing, but at this point in 2012, the Democratic lead was more than 307,000 votes. In other words, Democrats are lagging a bit behind their pace from 2012, a year when they narrowly lost the state. The reason might be in the demographics. African-American turnout is lower this year and they have dropped as a share of the early electorate from 28% in 2012 to about 23% today. As more polling places open this week \u2013 especially in counties with a large black electorate \u2013 their turnout might tick up. The overwhelming majority of African-Americans that voted already in North Carolina were also registered Democrats, so when their vote falls, it affects Clinton\u2019s chances in a significant way. Registered Republicans expanded their lead this week in Ohio. They\u2019re now ahead of Democrats by almost 66,000 votes, or about 5 points. They were only up by 2.5 points one week ago. This is good news for the Republican Party\u2019s chances in Ohio. That\u2019s because at this point in 2008, the last year when there is comparable data, Republicans led by a razor-thin margin of 0.4%. And that early vote lead wasn\u2019t enough for them to ultimately carry the Buckeye State that year. Early voting is down across Ohio this year. That\u2019s likely the result of cutbacks, imposed by the Republican-controlled legislature in 2013, to the number of days of early voting. CNN\u2019s Sonam Vashi contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Clinton reached back Thursday to some of the darkest moments of Trump's past Clinton also accused Trump of openly fueling \"his most hateful supporters\" The audience could barely hear the elderly African-American woman who introduced Hillary Clinton at an outdoor campaign rally here in Winterville, North Carolina. She wasn\u2019t close enough to the microphone, and she was also crying. Mae Brown Wiggins recalled applying for an apartment at a property operated by Donald Trump\u2019s family decades ago, and being rejected because she was black. \u201cTrump just turned me away because of the color of my skin. And they had done the same thing to many others,\u201d Wiggins said, pausing several times to wipe her eyes. \u201cWhen I think about how they lied to me just because I was black, I still feel the anger. I can\u2019t share this experience with him \u2026 without feeling the pain.\u201d A message left with the Trump campaign seeking response was not returned. Wiggins\u2019 emotional remarks on Friday were followed by a bleak speech from Clinton, in which the Democratic nominee reached back to some of the darkest moments of Trump\u2019s past \u2014 a pattern of racial discrimination in his past business dealings, his involvement in an infamous rape case that rocked New York City years ago and more recently, the support his presidential campaign has received from white supremacist groups. In her first public remarks about the 1989 \u201cCentral Park Five\u201d case, in which five men of color were wrongly convicted of rape, Clinton slammed Trump for taking out full-page ads in newspapers \u201ccalling for the death penalty.\u201d \u201cNearly three decades later, they were exonerated,\u201d she said. \u201cBut not only did Donald Trump refuse to apologize for calling for their execution, he actually said they should still be in prison. To him, those kids were still and will always be guilty, no matter what the evidence says.\u201d Clinton also accused Trump of openly fueling \u201chis most hateful supporters,\u201d as she pointed to the official newspaper of the Ku Klux Klan recently expressing its support for Trump. \u201cHe has spent this entire campaign offering a dog whistle to his most hateful supporters,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cHe retweets white supremacists and spreads racially tinged conspiracy theories. And you better believe he is being heard loudly and clearly.\u201d Clinton\u2019s remarks on Friday in North Carolina \u2013 where black turnout will be critical to whether the Democrat can win the state \u2013 was one of a series of recent somber speeches that the former secretary has delivered in the homestretch of the 2016 election. As a part of her broader strategy to convince voters that she is the only nominee who is qualified to be president, Clinton has repeatedly warned against Trump\u2019s divisive and inflammatory language. While she has never outright called him a racist, Clinton has continually painted the Republican nominee as racist and sexist, and has said repeatedly that he lacks the temperament to be commander in chief. In the final days of the election, Clinton has used targeted messaging to speak to different slices of the Democratic coalition that twice elected President Barack Obama. Clinton has looked to popular surrogates \u2013 namely Obama, First Lady Michelle Obama and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders \u2013 to help energize African-Americans, Latinos and young voters. Key to Clinton\u2019s strategy with these groups has been to turn Trump\u2019s own words against him. For example, the Clinton campaign released an ad on Thursday titled \u201cWe Are America,\u201d which strings together what Democrats view as Trump\u2019s greatest hits of offensive and salacious comments. This week, guests at Clinton events have included former Miss Universe Alicia Machado, whom Trump criticized after she gained weight, as well as Bruce Blair, a former ballistic missile launch officer who said he would \u201clive in constant fear\u201d if Trump were president. \u201cYou have got to ask yourself,\u201d Clinton said in Winterville on Friday. \u201cDo any of us, any of us who believe in our Constitution, believe in the rule of law, who believe that we are stronger together, who believe that we want to keep moving positively towards the vision of freedom and equality set forth by our founders, do any of us have a place in Trump\u2019s America?\u201d Hours later, at a rally in Raleigh with Sanders and musical artist Pharrell Williams, Clinton again shared with supporters Wiggins\u2019 story. And echoing her former primary rival, Clinton warned that Trump is on the verge of \u201cnormalizing discrimination.\u201d \u201cSo when you hear as Bernie so powerfully said at the end of his remarks that we are standing against the possibility of returning and normalizing discrimination, take it seriously,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cBecause it truly, it truly is at stake in this election.\u201d",

            "article_content": "The 19th Amendment gave women the right to vote in 1920 Not everyone in this demographic thought they'd see this day coming Less than a week before the first woman to be a major party nominee faces her rival on Election Day, women with nearly a century or more under their belts are sharing what it will be like to vote for Hillary Clinton. Not everyone in this demographic thought they\u2019d see this day coming. The political opportunities available to women when centenarians were born were so limited that some of them, like Estelle Liebow Schultz, never considered that a woman would one day serve in the White House. \u201cI never thought much about a woman being president, or about any women who might have been good presidents. There were no role models for that,\u201d the 98-year-old wrote in a Washington Post op-ed published Tuesday. \u201cWhen Hillary Clinton was in the White House as first lady, I never imagined her running for president. But I also never thought much about whether we would have a black president before I voted for Barack Obama in 2008.\u201d And while the supporters are quick to acknowledge Clinton\u2019s 30 years of public service as a motivation for their support, they aren\u2019t shy about acknowledging that gender influenced their decision. \u201cI think women do bring something different to office, a sensitivity that most men don\u2019t have,\u201d said Schultz, an educator. \u201cI saw the election of German Chancellor Angela Merkel and British Prime Minister Theresa May. Merkel, May and Hillary would be a wonderful triad to rule the world.\u201d \u201cMaybe they\u2019d be able to bring about some peace and quality growth that hasn\u2019t happened yet,\u201d she added. At 103, Ruline Steininger became one of the first people in Iowa to vote in person for Clinton during early voting in September, a day she didn\u2019t take for granted that she was able to see. \u201cI\u2019m going to help all the way. I\u2019m voting today,\u201d she told CNN in September. \u201cI\u2019m not taking any chances and leaving it \u2018til the election. When you\u2019re 103, you make every minute count.\u201d Steininger, a former school teacher, wrote Clinton earlier this year to share what it was like witnessing the first African-American president \u2013 Obama \u2013 and the first Catholic president \u2013 John F. Kennedy \u2013 move into the Oval Office. \u201cIn my second century, I look forward to seeing a woman president,\u201d she wrote. Jerry Emmett remembers going to the polls with her mother to cast her first vote. The retired educator was born in 1914 and has spent a century watching opportunities open up to women that were previously closed because of their gender. \u201cWe all walked out in the middle of the street and cheered, like they\u2019re cheering here \u2014 because my mother was going to get to have a say! That was something,\u201d Emmett told the Arizona Republic newspaper. Emmett, honorary chairwoman of the Arizona delegation to the Democratic National Convention, is known by many for her impassioned follow-up to Arizona Rep. Ruben Gallego announcing at the convention that 34 members of the state\u2019s 85-member delegation were voting for Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. \u201cAnd 51 votes for the next president of the United States of America, Hillary Rodham Clinton,\u201d the 102-year-old said to cheers. Women were not given the Constitutional right to vote until the passage of he 19th Amendment on August 18, 1920. Even after this, many women of color were denied the right to vote. Federal legislation prohibiting racial discrimination in voting was not passed until 1965. CNN\u2019s MJ Lee, Alex Lee and Jeremy Moorhead contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Undecided North Carolina voters signed up for a local Citizens Police Academy The academy comes in the wake of community-police relationship becoming a campaign issue There are many key issues in this election. But there is one issue that\u2019s particularly important to some voters in the battleground state of North Carolina. Community-police relations are strained in light of the police-involved shooting of Keith Scott and the riots that followed in Charlotte, and it\u2019s leaving some voters undecided of which candidate to turn to. \u201cI\u2019ve never seen an election where it\u2019s so polarizing,\u201d said Cassandra Johnson. \u201cThat\u2019s very frustrating to me.\u201d Cassandra Johnson is African-American and lives in Durham, just two and a half hours from Charlotte. \u201cI think it\u2019s in the back of people\u2019s mind. Charlotte\u2019s so close and you wouldn\u2019t think something like Charlotte would happen,\u201d said Johnston. \u201cYou just see kind of the potential that maybe it could happen here.\u201d Community-police relations have been a topic at the presidential debates. Hillary Clinton wants legislation that will end racial profiling by law enforcement. Donald Trump wants to bring back stop-and-frisk, which he says brought down New York City\u2019s crime rate in the 1990s. Undecided voter Lee Edsall, who is also from Durham, said this very topic has her questioning her choices for president. \u201cThis is the first time I\u2019ve had trouble deciding,\u201d she said. \u201cThe job is just way too important. It literally could be the end of the world if you get somebody who\u2019s likely to fire off nuclear weapons at 3 in the morning.\u201d Johnson and Edsall are frustrated with their options for president. They\u2019re also frustrated with police community relations in their state. They decided to seek answers with the Durham Police Department and signed up for the Citizens Police Academy. It\u2019s a once a year, six-week program where residents meet with various departments from the Durham police. According to the Durham police, this year they had the most applications for the program to date. Residents had candid conversations with officers about race and bias and participated in a shooting simulation where residents got to experience the split-second decisions officer have to make. \u201cI can understand why people can make the wrong decision in some cases,\u201d said Johnson after she watched her colleagues go through the simulation. \u201cNot because it\u2019s with malicious intent, but because it\u2019s a split decision.\u201d Part of the program is designed to let officers take a pulse on the community. They need residents to be on their side in order to help keep their communities safe. \u201cI would think that folks in the community may not fully trust police officers,\u201d said Officer Laurence Brown, who runs the program. \u201cIt\u2019s our job to meet them more than halfway.\u201d Johnson and Edsall know their vote is more valuable than ever, which is why they\u2019re weighing their options heavily. \u201cI can\u2019t get past the things he said about women or African-Americans,\u201d Johnson said of Trump. \u201cBut there are pieces of his platform that I like.

            "article_content": "The numbers include some good news for Republicans in Ohio and Iowa Meanwhile, results are favorable for Democrats in Florida, Arizona and Colorado About 18 million Americans already voted before FBI Director James Comey made the bombshell announcement that he found new emails possibly relating to Hillary Clinton\u2019s private server. The numbers include some good news for Republicans in Ohio and Iowa, and good news for Democrats in Florida, Arizona and Colorado, based on a CNN analysis of the latest early voting data. These conclusions were formed by comparing today\u2019s partisan turnout to historical levels from past years. Registered Democrats have also cast more votes than registered Republicans in North Carolina and Nevada, though there are signs that the leads they amassed last weekend have receded somewhat in recent days. That\u2019s because the gap between Democrats and Republicans in those states is narrowing. These findings represent absentee ballots and early votes cast by more than 18.6 million Americans across 37 states where data are available. CNN has partnered with Catalist, a data company that works with progressive candidates and groups, to receive detailed early vote return information this year. Catalist\u2019s voter list connects returned ballots with demographic and registration information, such as party registration, gender and age, and allows a closer look at who has already cast a vote. These are not results \u2013 ballots aren\u2019t tallied until Election Day. But the findings provide clues on who is voting, and which party is turning out to vote. And while the numbers track voters\u2019 party affiliations, not all Democrats are voting for Clinton, and not all Republicans are supporting Donald Trump. Here\u2019s a look at the early voting data from several battleground states: Registered Republicans took the lead in Arizona this week, edging ahead of Democrats who surprisingly maintained a narrow turnout advantage during the first two weeks of early voting. But it\u2019s not all good news for the GOP: Their advantage today is about half the size it was at this point in 2012. Republicans are currently ahead of Democrats by 34,000 votes, or 3.6% of the vote. At this point in 2012, Republicans were ahead by more than 62,000 votes, which translated to a 9.7% lead. More than 915,000 people have already voted in Arizona, an increase from this time in 2012. About two-thirds of all votes in the Grand Canyon State were cast early in the last presidential election. Colorado conducts its elections almost entirely by mail \u2013 every registered voter has already been mailed a ballot, and they can send it in whenever they want before Election Day. Registered Democrats continue to lead Republicans in terms of turnout \u2013 an edge they\u2019ve maintained since ballots started being returned. They\u2019re up about 27,000 votes, which is a significant turnaround from this time in 2012, when Republicans were leading by about 19,000 votes. Republicans led at this time in 2012 but Obama ultimately carried the Centennial State, and the fact that Democrats are ahead at this point could be good news for Clinton. Some key Democratic groups, such as younger voters, wait until the last minute to mail in their ballots. In fact, 38% of all ballots returned have come from voters over 65, even though that age group was only 16% of the Colorado electorate in 2012. Georgia has crossed the 1 million mark in terms of ballots cast. More than 1,061,000 people have already hit the polls in the Peach State \u2013 a spike of about 37% from this time in 2012. Voters do not register with a party in Georgia, so it\u2019s impossible to know whether Democrats or Republicans are ahead in turnout. But the state does compile statistics on the racial breakdown of the voters. So far, the electorate is slightly less diverse than it was at this point in 2012. Turnout among white voters rose by about 3%, while turnout among black voters is down by about 4.5%. About half of all voters in Georgia cast their ballot before Election Day in 2012. Republicans continue to lead Democrats in Florida early voting by a very slim margin. Registered Republicans are ahead by about 13,545 votes, a smaller lead than they had one week ago. This is still a decent showing for the GOP \u2013 it\u2019s preferable to be ahead than behind \u2013 but they are still behind their pace from 2008, the last year that comparable data is available. At this point in 2008, registered Republicans had a 44,000-vote advantage, which meant they were ahead by about 2.8%. But even with that advantage in the early vote, it wasn\u2019t enough for John McCain to carry the Sunshine State. Florida currently leads the nation in terms of early turnout, almost 3 million ballots already cast. A majority of the state\u2019s voters went to the polls early in both 2012 and 2008. Iowans have been voting since September, and the data has been consistently good for Republicans. There are positive signs for the GOP because Democrats are underperforming compared to past years. Democrats are winning the turnout battle, and are currently ahead of Republicans by about 39,000 votes. But that\u2019s a significant drop from their position at this point in 2012, when they led by 56,000. Democrats enjoyed a similar lead of about 50,000 votes at this point in 2008 as well. Furthermore, the Democratic lead has been shrinking. They were up by 16% one week ago, but they\u2019re ahead by 10% today. This lag could give an opening for Trump to flip the state red this year. Democrats continue to lead early voting in Nevada about a week after in-person early voting kicked off. The Democratic edge stands at about 26,000 votes. That\u2019s a good sign for Democrats up and down the ballot \u2013 in addition to the presidential race, there are competitive Senate and House seats up for grabs. Earlier this week, Democrats were doing better than 2012. But according to the latest data, they are now slightly behind that pace: They\u2019re up by 8.8% today, but were ahead by 9.3% at this time in 2012. Almost 70% of all Nevada voters went to the polls early in 2012. The Democratic advantage in North Carolina\u2019s early voting continues, but may be slowing down. They\u2019re up by more than 186,000 votes, which gives them a 15% lead over registered Republicans. This is the smallest lead (as a percent of the vote) Democrats have seen since early voting began October 20. There are signs that Democratic turnout started strong but has sagged over time. According to data released last week, Democrats were ahead of their 2012 pace. Now they are slightly behind. Turnout among African American voters in has apparently dropped. So far, black voters are about 23% of the early voting electorate. That number was 29% at this point four years ago. More than 6 in 10 voters in the Tar Heel State cast early ballots in 2012. Republicans have a lead in Ohio, a pivotal battleground that is looking like a must-win state for Trump. Registered Republicans are up by about 39,000 votes, an improvement from their position in 2008. Ohio reports party registration based on which party\u2019s primary a voter participated in, and 2008 was the last year when both Democrats and Republicans held contested primaries in Ohio. About one-third of Ohioans voted early in 2012. That number is on track to be lower this year, a likely result of the Republican-led legislature scaling back the number of early voting days. That change was enacted in 2013 and is in effect for the first time in a presidential election this year. CNN\u2019s Jennifer Agiesta and David Heath contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: During the 1972 election, Timothy Crouse penned \u201cThe Boys on the Bus\u201d \u2013 a book that introduced us to the gritty (mostly male) journalists on the campaign trail. Over four decades later, the daily grind of election may be the same, but the faces have certainly changed.  Meet CNN\u2019s \u201cGirls on the Bus.\u201d Somewhere along the campaign trail I fell into the habit of smiling back at members of the crowd as they jeered at me. Some days it felt like that was my armor \u2013 a shield from the chants of \u201cCNN sucks.\u201d Other times I hoped it would be a signal. \u201cHey, I\u2019m just doing my job. I know you\u2019re mad at me, but I\u2019m not mad at you.\u201d It was evident early on that Donald Trump was a different kind of candidate. He didn\u2019t just hold a grudge against the media \u2013 a battle that\u2019s become the norm for Republican candidates. No, he held grudges with specific members of the media. I got an early taste of it in November 2015 when Trump called me out by name at a rally in South Carolina. He referred to me as a \u201ctotal novice reporter\u201d and did an unflattering impression of me doing a live shot. The crowd followed his lead, turning around to taunt me. For a year and a half I have followed Trump around the United States and, at times, overseas in his unlikely and in many ways unprecedented bid for the presidency. Whether it was an unexpected endorsement from New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie during the primaries, or a surprise appearance with women who have accused Bill Clinton of sexual misconduct, Trump has kept the press on its toes. Balancing motherhood and the 2016 campaign I\u2019ve missed morning spin classes and nights at home with my fianc\u00e9. During a weekend off in Kansas City I frantically made phone calls between sips of coffee and bites of donut after Trump fired his first campaign manager, Corey Lewandowski. At my sister\u2019s bachelorette party in New Orleans, I slipped away under the guise of getting a manicure and pedicure. Mostly I made calls about the drumbeat that prompted Trump to can his second campaign head, Paul Manafort. Trump knows how to seize a news cycle, for better or for worse \u2013 and sometimes for reasons he can\u2019t entirely control. In March, we were in New Orleans for one of the last rallies before the Trump campaign beefed up their security. It felt like a tinderbox. Protests broke out continuously. Many of the protesters were young; some of them teenagers. Many of them were minorities. As security came to escort them out, members of the crowd tore at their clothes, grabbed for them, kicked them. S.E. Cupp talks about how Republican women get it from all sides After the first few were removed, I wanted to scream at the protesters to stop resisting \u2013 to yell that if they dragged their feet the crowd was going to turn on them. I held my tongue. When we arrived in San Jose in June, I wanted to see the Trump event from the other side. I was roaming the streets on protest duty \u2013 an assignment that was largely quiet until Trump\u2019s rally started to disperse. Anti-Trump protesters started hunting for people in the signature \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hats and t-shirts. A flash caught my eye. It was a teenager in Trump gear, sprinting with a mob in pursuit. The kid didn\u2019t stop running until he was safely ensconced behind a wall of police officers wearing riot gear. I interviewed him and his father afterward. They held up a pile of Trump campaign signs they hoped to bring home from the rally that night; each one had been ripped out of their hands, shredded by protesters who reviled Trump. Over the course of a year and a half, I\u2019ve seen Trump supporters who have spit in protesters\u2019 faces. I\u2019ve seen them hurl racial slurs with abandon. I\u2019ve also watched protesters cold-cock Trump supporters \u2013 and vice versa \u2013 in fits of rage. And I\u2019ve watched Trump opponents harass a woman and pelt her with eggs. Why I'm voting for Trump Time and time again, I have seen Americans from both sides of the aisle fail to treat one another with respect and dignity. I\u2019ve watched them fail to treat one another as human beings. In many ways, the final months of the campaign have been the darkest. Now, members of the media walk into an event like Trump\u2019s mid-October rally in Cincinnati, greeted by a crowd of thousands screaming at us about biased coverage and flipping us off. It didn\u2019t happen in a vacuum. The anger and emotion against the establishment \u2013 whether that meant politicians, the press or the financial elite \u2013 didn\u2019t build overnight. The \u201cdishonest media\u201d had been one of Trump\u2019s favorite foils for a while by the time Christie endorsed him in February. That was the day someone tampered with the cables of our live truck. We struggled to take the news of the endorsement live while our cables were cut not once, but twice. During the general election, we were at a stop in Florida when someone followed my producer to our car. When we left the event hours later, we discovered someone keyed our car on both sides. The night of that raucous rally in Cincinnati, as thousands of Trump supporters bellowed at us, my mind was elsewhere. When I landed at the Cincinnati airport the night before, my fellow passengers and I began to notice some activity on the tarmac as we were deplaning. It was the honor guard. We got off the plane and, one by one, started huddling in the corner near a window overlooking the tarmac. We watched as the honor guard stood in formation. The man next to me gasped as a family walked onto the tarmac. We were separated by yards of darkness and by the cool glass walls of the airport terminal. But there was no mistaking that family\u2019s grief as they held one another and waited for the casket to come off the plane. We didn\u2019t know the fallen soldier. We didn\u2019t know the family huddled on that tarmac. But as the casket came rolling off the plane, I wept with my fellow passengers. The man next to me held his hand to his forehead in a salute. Amid the chaos of that Trump rally, all I could think about was that solemn moment the night before. In a year where compassion has sometimes felt in short supply, where politicians from both political parties have at times failed to inspire, Americans are still quietly honoring one another for their sacrifices. They\u2019re propping each other up and empathizing with each other in moments of pain. That\u2019s the kind of country we want to be.",

            "article_content": "I was lecturing a friend one day about the need to vote when he countered with a question about my civic duty: Why don\u2019t you ever stand for the national anthem? An awkward silence followed his question and then he added: \u201cI never asked why.  I thought you had some feelings about America. I figured you had your reasons.\u201d He was right. Long before NFL quarterback Colin Kaepernick refused to stand for the anthem, I started remaining seated when it was played. I didn\u2019t do it for attention or to protest. As a person of color, I just couldn\u2019t relate to the America that the anthem rhapsodized. How do I love a country that doesn\u2019t love my people back? Patriotism, I thought, was the language of white America; it didn\u2019t speak to me. But something has shifted within me during the last eight years, and it goes beyond witnessing the election of the nation\u2019s first black president. President Barack Obama and others have redefined what it means to \u201clove America.\u201d I\u2019m seeing the birth of a new brand of patriotism that finally speaks to me and other nonwhite Americans. I bring up Obama and patriotism now because so many people are reflecting on his legacy. The Obama era is being described as a prelude to the \u201cbrowning of America\u201d when racial minorities become the majority in the future. Yet I think it\u2019s the prelude to something even more. The definition of what it means to love America will expand. The browning of America won\u2019t just change how the country looks in the future; it will change how Americans express patriotism, because racial minorities bring different histories to this notion of America as the \u201cland of the free.\u201d I know I do. I\u2019ve long felt ambivalent when people tell me I should love America. I wonder what America are they talking about. Should I just be happy, as one white man once told me, that my ancestors were rescued from the jungles of Africa and brought to the greatest country in the world? That man embodied the \u201clove it or leave\u201d attitude that I associate with flag wavers. It\u2019s a pugnacious patriotism that one can hear in country singer Merle Haggard\u2019s song, \u201cThe Fighting Side of Me.\u201d Haggard released the song as anti-war protests surged during the Vietnam War. I hear people talkin\u2019 bad,About the way we have to live here in this country,Harpin\u2019 on the wars we fight,An\u2019 gripin\u2019 \u2018bout the way things oughta be.An\u2019 I don\u2019t mind \u2018em switchin\u2019 sides,An\u2019 standin\u2019 up for things they believe in.When they\u2019re runnin\u2019 down my country, man,They\u2019re walkin\u2019 on the fightin\u2019 side of me. That\u2019s the type of kick-butt patriotism I believed in when I was growing up. My childhood heroes were soldiers like Audie Murphy, the most decorated American soldier in World War II. I read his biography, \u201cTo Hell and Back,\u201d three times in junior high school. I almost cried when Davy Crockett died near the end of the movie \u201cThe Alamo.\u201d I plastered US Marine memorabilia on the walls of my boyhood bedroom. I didn\u2019t think about it at the time, but all my childhood heroes were white men carrying guns, typically with American flags waving in the background. I vaguely knew about people like the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., but they didn\u2019t excite me. Singing \u201cWe Shall Overcome\u201d didn\u2019t compare to storming the sands of Iwo Jima. I thought there was no greater courage than to go to war for your country. Then I came across a group of college students who taught me about another type of courage. I was channel surfing one day when I stumbled upon a PBS documentary on the Freedom Riders. They were an interracial group of college students who decided to sit next to one another on bus rides through the Deep South in the early 1960s. They were trying to desegregate interstate bus travel. Sitting next to a person of another race on a bus doesn\u2019t sound dangerous. But you risked death if you did that in the segregated South. Many Freedom Riders actually signed last wills and testaments before the trips because they didn\u2019t expect to return. Their fears were not unfounded. They were attacked by mobs wielding baseball bats and chains. Several were almost beaten to death. Many would carry physical and psychological scars for the rest of their lives. All were unarmed. Their only weapon: faith that their country could be better. This was a dangerous type of patriotism, not a polite demonstration or mild civil disobedience. It was the kind that could get you fired from your job, shunned by your community, beaten or killed. Yet it was the kind of patriotism that made progress possible in America, said Ralph Young, author of \u201cDissent: The History of an American Idea.\u201d He said people often forget the United States was founded by political and religious dissenters fleeing Europe. They put the right to dissent in the Constitution, he said. \u201cDissent is the fuel for the engine of progress,\u201d said Young, a history professor at Temple University in Philadelphia. \u201cInertia is built into institutions. Things don\u2019t change unless people push for change.\u201d Most of us were taught in school that dissent is patriotic.  Dissenters are venerated, but usually only after they\u2019re dead and neutered by time.  During war, economic uncertainty or massive social change, the \u201clove it or leave it\u201d form of patriotism rules. Yet something different has happened during the Obama era. He has helped legitimize the dangerous type of patriotism. He\u2019s done this through words and deeds. No other president has talked about patriotism the way Obama has. It\u2019s a type of patriotism  many nonwhite Americans can finally see themselves in. Consider Obama\u2019s speech in Selma, Alabama, last year. Some consider it his own \u201cGettysburg Address.\u201d He gave it at the foot of the Edmund Pettus Bridge, commemorating the epic civil rights campaign that spawned the Voting Rights Act. In that speech, Obama declared that America is great not just because of what it was, but because of what it is becoming.  He said \u201cAmerica is not some fragile thing\u201d that can\u2019t tolerate citizens demanding change. \u201cWhat greater form of patriotism is there than the belief that America is not yet finished, that we are strong enough to be self-critical?\u201d he asked. He called members of disparaged groups \u2013 gays and lesbians, Mexican immigrants \u2013 American heroes. He praised the \u201chopeful strivers who cross the Rio Grande\u201d and \u201cthe gay Americans whose blood ran on the streets of San Francisco and New York.\u201d He also put women, not white men in powdered wigs, at the center of the America story. He cited a 19th century former slave who became an abolitionist and champion of women\u2019s rights, and another civil rights activist from the 1960s whose fiery eloquence forced America to face the brutality of segregation in the Deep South. \u201cLook at our history,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are Sojourner Truth and Fannie Lou Hamer, women who could do as much as men and then some.\u201d The Selma speech was Obama\u2019s answer to critics who said he didn\u2019t believe in American exceptionalism. He just redefined it, and as the country gets browner, I suspect this form of patriotism will become more accepted. The Selma speech was hailed as a classic. In an Atlantic article entitled, \u201cFinally I Hear a Politician Explain My Country Just the Way I Understand It,\u201d the author James Fallows said  Obama \u201cexpressed the essence of our American creed.\u201d Greg Jaffe, another commentator, compared the speech to Lincoln\u2019s \u201cGettysburg Address.\u201d He said it \u201crewrote American history, putting America\u2019s rebels, protest leaders, misfits, artists and immigrants at the center of the story.\u201d The speech spoke to America\u2019s future \u2013 a time when the nation is expected to become \u201cmajority minority,\u201d Jaffe wrote in the Washington Post. \u201cSelma is the first great presidential address to speak to that America and a speech only our first black president could give,\u201d he wrote. Obama expressed the same sentiments at another patriotic milestone: The dedication last month of a new Smithsonian National Museum of African American History and Culture in Washington. Again, the same concept \u2013 troublemakers past and present \u2013 are true patriots, he said. \u201cThis is the place to understand how protests and love of country don\u2019t merely coexist, but inform each other,\u201d Obama said. \u201cHow men can probably win the gold for their country, but still insist on raising a black-gloved fist. How we can wear an I Can\u2019t Breathe T-shirt, and still grieve for fallen police officers.\u201d This form of patriotism isn\u2019t new. It\u2019s the kind that people of color have had to develop because white America\u2019s narrow definition of patriotism didn\u2019t fit. It is the type of patriotism that the black poet Langston Hughes expressed in his 1935 poem \u201cLet America Be America Again.\u201d In it, he gives his own variation of the call to make America great again. O, let America be America again-The land that never has been yet-And yet must be- Never has this type of patriotism been expressed so forcefully from the highest office in the land. Yet I\u2019ve watched it spread to ordinary American life in so many different ways. It is a patriotism that insists on seeing the good, bad and ugly of America\u2019s past. One reason I didn\u2019t stand for the anthem is because I didn\u2019t feel this country had ever officially acknowledged its original sin, slavery. There was a museum that commemorated the European holocaust but there was none to acknowledge the African-American slave trade. But the African-American museum in Washington has changed that fact. Slavery is dealt with head-on. On display is an actual slave cabin, a receipt for a teenage girl slave, and an iron neck-ring forged for another slave. There are other signs that the nation is more willing to recognize its other \u201coriginal sin,\u201d the virtual genocide of Native Americans. There\u2019s a burgeoning movement to replace Columbus Day celebrations with \u201cIndigenous Peoples\u2019 Day\u201d honoring Native Americans. At least 26 cities are replacing Columbus Day with the new holiday. And at a White House conference last month hosted by Obama, the federal government agreed to pay $492 million to 17 Native American tribes for mismanaging their funds and natural resources. The Obama administration has now settled at least 100 tribal claims, some over a century old. Cherokee Nation Principal Chief Bill John Baker said Obama \u201cis the best president for Indian Country in the history of the United States.\u201d Beyond Washington, there are signs that Americans are thinking differently about patriotism. When Muhammad Ali died earlier this year, he was treated like an American hero. Yet he was once one of the country\u2019s most hated dissidents because he refused to fight for his country. Most of the tributes that followed his death pinned his greatness not on his boxing ability, but on his willingness to defy the government for his religious beliefs. Today another black athlete is provoking fury for being \u201cun-American\u201d:  Colin Kaepernick, with his refusal to stand for the national anthem. But compare the response Kaepernick has received  to the scorn and professional exile that Ali endured. Two weeks after Kaepernick\u2019s protest, his jersey became the top seller in NFL sales. Other professional athletes followed his example. So have high school football teams throughout the nation. A professional soccer player, Megan Rapinoe, also took a knee while the anthem was played, later explaining that \u201cbeing a gay American, I know what it means to look at the flag and not have it protect all of your liberties.\u201d Kaepernick even got an impassioned defense from an unlikely source: a former Navy SEAL. Former Minnesota Gov. Jesse Ventura posted a video online in which he said he fully and completely supported Kaepernick. He literally saluted Kaepernick for having the courage of his convictions and said \u201cwhether I agree with him or not is irrelevant.\u201d Ventura recalled that he vetoed a bill when he was governor that would have required the recitation of the Pledge of Allegiance in every Minnesota public school. \u201cYou know why?\u201d he said in the video. \u201cBecause governments should not mandate patriotism. \u2026 Who mandated patriotism? The Germans in the 1930s.\u201d Americans are accustomed to public figures taking public stands on controversial issues. But for change to really take root, it has to occur away from the spotlight \u2013 and come from someone you\u2019d never expect to see it in. That\u2019s what recently happened in Charlotte, North Carolina, a week after a black police officer killed a black man in front of his wife. The shooting sparked protests that turned violent and a man was shot to death during a demonstration. With the city still on edge, a pastor decided to deliver a sermon. His name is Loran Livingston, and he is a white, conservative evangelical. He grew up during segregation in a rural area of North Carolina that was dominated by the Ku Klux Klan. He believes in the inerrancy of the Bible and is a military buff who collects guns and knives. The police officer who allegedly killed the man, sparking the protest, is a member of his church. Dissent is the fuel for the engine of progress. Ralph Young, author of \"Dissent: The History of an American Idea\" One could have expected Livingston to give a hellfire sermon condemning the protesters in Charlotte, but the pastor said something different. He condemned the violence and praised the police officers who took an oath to protect citizens. He also defended the officer in his congregation who was at the center of the protests, saying he did his sworn duty and \u201cyou will not find a finer young man.\u201d But he also said that many of the protesters had \u201cgenuine grievances,\u201d and that many Americans don\u2019t want to admit that there is a \u201ccaste system in the nation.\u201d As several members of his Central Church of God congregation stirred nervously in their seats, Livingston condemned \u201ccountry club\u201d Christian churches where all the members look alike and send their kids to private schools. He asked his congregation to consider the perspective of poor blacks living in Charlotte who see billion-dollar sports complexes sprout up while they struggle to make ends meet. \u201cAnd with all that, they turn on the TV and they watch someone who has no clue say make America great again,\u201d Livingston thundered, \u201cand these people are saying, \u2018When was it ever great for me?\u2019\u201d But maybe it could be one day. That\u2019s the hope that has helped so many Americans in the past who felt like outsiders. How does society accommodate this new form of patriotism that incorporates the good, bad and ugly of America, but still looks forward to something better in the future? Maybe I\u2019ll never stand for the anthem. But for the first time as an adult, I can find the words and examples to explain why I think America is exceptional. You may prefer the \u201clove it or leave it\u201d America. But I, and I suspect many others, believe in another America \u2013 \u201cthe one that never was and yet must be.\u201d Correction: An earlier version of this article incorrectly described an officer-involved shooting. It was a black officer who shot a black man in the Charlotte incident.",

            "article_content": "The New York Daily News that Bush hinted he was going to vote for Johnson Bush routinely says he's not going to vote for Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton Jeb Bush sought to downplay a new report that he was voting for Gary Johnson, saying he hasn\u2019t made up his mind. But the former Republican presidential candidate confirmed that he\u2019s still considering the Libertarian nominee. \u201cIt\u2019s a secret ballot,\u201d he told reporters after speaking at Harvard\u2019s Kennedy School on Thursday. \u201cI haven\u2019t made up my mind what I\u2019m going to do.\u201d The New York Daily News reported that Bush hinted he was going to vote for Johnson at an event hosted by the Manhattan Institute on Wednesday. He reportedly joked about \u201cPresident Johnson\u201d and mouthed the nominee\u2019s name to a man who said he didn\u2019t want to vote for either major political party nominee. \u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d the former Florida governor said, when asked Thursday if he mouthed Johnson\u2019s name as described in the article. Bush routinely says \u2013 and repeated it again on Thursday \u2013 that he\u2019s not going to vote for Republican Donald Trump or Democrat Hillary Clinton. \u201cI\u2019m at peace with my decision,\u201d he said, saying neither meet the \u201cthreshold\u201d of the presidency. \u201cIt\u2019s not a binary choice for me.\u201d Bush said he\u2019s not being \u201cderelict in my civic duties\u201d and vowed to still vote for someone. \u201cThe presidency is a place where, for whatever reason, I\u2019m not comfortable supporting either party\u2019s nominee.\u201d Asked what would happen if the average voter took his stance and didn\u2019t vote for Clinton or Trump, Bush said such an act would send a signal. \u201cWell, if everybody didn\u2019t vote, that would be a pretty powerful political statement, wouldn\u2019t it?\u201d Johnson, who\u2019s reached as high as 10% in some polls, has come under heat lately for making mistakes in interviews. On MSNBC Wednesday, he failed to name a world leader that he admired, a gaffe that came just weeks after he didn\u2019t recognize the city of Aleppo that rests at the heart of the Syrian civil war. Bush was also asked about his father\u2019s decision to vote for Hillary Clinton. The former governor expressed frustration at Kathleen Hartington Kennedy Townsend, though he didn\u2019t mention her by name, for breaking the news by posting about it on Facebook following a private event she attended with the former president. \u201cI thought it was a little inappropriate for a person to overhear a frail, 92-year-old man, in a private setting, at a reception for the Points of Light foundation \u2013 which focuses on volunteerism \u2013 to hear this and immediately go on Facebook and put it on there and then go on national television and not even show up at the board meeting,\u201d he said. \u201cI thought that was inappropriate.\u201d Bush\u2019s speech Thursday night is part of a multi-visit commitment this fall to speak about education policy as a guest lecturer. His remarks Thursday night were focused more broadly on his ideas to address poverty. While he fielded questions from the audience about the substance of his speech, he also got a few political questions. One student started off a question saying, \u201cThis has obviously been a tough election cycle,\u201d \u201cTell me about it,\u201d Bush deadpanned, drawing laughs as he sipped from a glass of water. \u201cI\u2019m going to give you a nickname like my brother does: \u2018Captain Obvious.\u2019\u201d The student went on to ask about Bush\u2019s thoughts on Trump saying the political process is \u201crigged\u201d against candidates like him. \u201cTrump only talks about things being rigged when it\u2019s not going well for him,\u201d Bush said, again drawing laughs. \u201cWhen things are going well, all of a sudden the system looks pretty good, it\u2019s working well. I guess that\u2019s human nature. So you can measure how he thinks the campaign is going by the rapidity of whether it\u2019s rigged or not. That\u2019s a leading indicator.\u201d It\u2019s no secret that Bush holds low regard for the Republican nominee, a man who Bush says rose to prominence by feeding off of voters\u2019 fears rather than their hopes. He acknowledged that his unsuccessful bid was \u201creally disappointing\u201d and reiterated lines from his stump speech calling for the restoration of \u201ccivility.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not going to change who I am. I\u2019m not going to be angry,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m committed to my views and I fight for my views, but the idea that you\u2019re weak if you\u2019re warm-hearted or you believe that someone that disagrees with you is an evil person, man we got to stop that. That is just dangerous for our democracy.\u201d Bush also spoke at length about racial tension in the country, suggesting repeatedly that criminal justice reform measures may be one step in easing some of the anxiety between law enforcement and minority communities. Talking about Colin Kaepernick \u2013 the San Francisco 49ers quarterback who kneels during the national anthem out of protest, saying the country oppresses African-Americans \u2013 Bush said he\u2019s \u201ctroubled\u201d by his decision but respects \u201chis right to do it.\u201d \u201cBut all the sports commentators that are talking about it say we are going to have a conversation about it,\u201d he said. \u201cWell we don\u2019t, we just say we\u2019re having a conversation about it. I\u2019ve not heard one tangible thing said on television about this issue, how we can solve it and I think we truly do have to have a set of policies that change it.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Obama thanks military members, bereaved relatives for service President compares much-criticized VA to ocean liner that takes time to turn President Barack Obama came face to face with the human cost borne by the military\u2019s 9/11 generation on Wednesday during a CNN presidential town hall moderated by Jake Tapper. Appearing before a\u00a0military\u00a0audience in Fort Lee, Virginia, Obama also confronted the limits of his own power as he fielded probing questions about terrorist groups and health care delays for veterans. It all played out against the backdrop of the first congressional override of a veto during Obama\u2019s nearly eight years in office. Obama holds town hall at military base While he repeatedly expressed empathy and gratitude for the sacrifices of so many in the audience, he found himself grappling with situations where the government hadn\u2019t been able to do enough. Donna Coates, whose husband Barry died from colon cancer after waiting a year for a scan due to delays at a Veterans Affairs facility, asked Obama why vets still struggled for adequate medical care despite his administration\u2019s promises to fix the problems. RELATED: Aleppo teeters but no sign of US action \u201cNothing has changed,\u201d Coates said. \u201cI am now a widow and my family, we won\u2019t ever be the same.\u201d Obama said his heart went out to Coates, pledging to look into why the contracted doctor said to have misdiagnosed her husband was still treating vets. But he said his administration was working diligently to fix the VA and had made progress, adding that no President had increased the department\u2019s budget faster and more aggressively than he had. \u201cWe now have a situation where about 80% of individuals who interact with the VA are satisfied that they are getting timely treatment. I want that to be 100%,\u201d Obama said, comparing the VA to an ocean liner that takes time to get on the right course. Another widow, Amanda Souza, whose husband took his own life after suffering post-traumatic stress disorder from multiple deployments, fought her emotions to plead with Obama to do more for troops\u2019 mental health \u2013 warning that many like her husband were scared to ask for help. \u201cHe ended up joining the ranks of the, on average, 22 veterans a day that commit suicide,\u201d said Souza. \u201cThis is something we just have to talk about more,\u201d Obama responded, noting that he had instructed the Joint Chiefs of Staff to de-stigmatize mental health issues. He said there was nothing weak about soldiers asking for help. There were also moments when Obama was challenged by audience members, including Tina Houchins, whose 19-year-old son Aaron was killed in Baghdad in 2007. She brought up accusations that Obama was unwilling to label terrorism as specifically linked to Islam. Obama replied by saying the notion was \u201cmanufactured\u201d by his critics and argued that al Qaeda and ISIS had perverted Islam as an excuse for carnage and death. He then offered an extended defense of why \u2013 though he said he doesn\u2019t object to the term \u2013 he doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s helpful to use. Recent Medal of Honor recipients \u201cWhen you start calling these organizations Islamic terrorists, the way it is heard, the way it is received by our friends and allies around the world, is that somehow Islam is terroristic. That then makes them feel as if they are under attack,\u201d he said warning against a contest between the West and Islam. And he was asked by 1st Lt. James Sutter, who serves in a mortuary affairs company, whether he appreciates that many in the military who had seen comrades lay down their lives did not like to see NFL players kneeling during the national anthem to protest racial disparities in policing \u2013 a practice Obama previously defended. \u201cI believe that us honoring our flag and our anthem is part of what binds us together as a nation,\u201d Obama said. \u201cBut I am also always trying to remind folks that part of what makes this country special is that we respect people\u2019s rights to have a different opinion \u2026 We fight sometimes so that people can do things we disagree with.\u201d Some of the questions forced the President to ponder the limits of his own capacity to effect change not just within military institutions such as the VA, but in Washington and around the world. While he was out of town for the forum, Congress acted to override\u00a0one of his vetoes for the first time. The new law allows relatives of 9/11 victims to sue Saudi Arabia and other countries alleged to be complicit in terror attacks on Americans. \u201cI think it was a mistake,\u201d Obama said of the override, though he added, \u201cI understand why it happened. Obviously all of us still carry the scars and trauma of 9/11.\u201d He blamed the override on election year politics. \u201cIf you\u2019re perceived as voting against 9/11 families right before an\u00a0election, not surprisingly, that\u2019s a hard vote for people to take,\u201d he said.\u00a0\u201cAnd it was, you know, basically a political vote.\u201d RELATED: Congress overrides Obama\u2019s veto of 9/11 bill The constraints on Obama\u2019s power abroad were also on display. He painstakingly defended his decision not to become more involved in stopping the carnage in Syria, even after recently admitting that he is constantly haunted by the human toll of the civil war. \u201cThere hasn\u2019t been probably a week that has gone by in which I haven\u2019t examined some of the underlying premises around how we are dealing with this situation in Syria,\u201d Obama told Tapper. But, he continued, \u201cthere is not a scenario in which, absent us deploying large numbers of troops, we can stop a civil war in which both sides are deeply dug in.\u201d He concluded, \u201cIt is in these situations where you have to make judgments about what is best for the national security interests of the United States even though what you see is heartbreaking.\u201d Laying out one of his core national security rationales, he said great nations get in trouble when they become over-extended. Col. Adam Butler, who served in Afghanistan and is the Fort Lee Garrison Commander, asked Obama how he could prevent gains made there from being lost when US troops leave, as happened in Iraq. The President said that Washington and its allies were working to train and equip Afghanistan\u2019s armed forces and to maintain a counter-terrorism operation in the country. But he\u00a0also argued that much rested on the behavior of local governments that the US cannot always control. \u201cThis is true in Iraq, this is true in Afghanistan \u2026 those governments also have to be responsive to people,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have to work to eliminate corruption and their leadership has to say, \u2018We are not going to treat Sunnis differently than Shi\u2019ite or Kurd or whatever ethnic groups are in these countries.\u2019 \u201c \u201cWe are not going to have the capacity to police every one of these countries, to run every one of these countries,\u201d Obama said, referring to Libya, Somalia and Yemen. U.S. military photos from August Obama was also clearly conscious of the fact that his time as commander in chief is almost over and with it his commanding bully pulpit. He used one of his last prime-time television venues Wednesday night to warn against the vision of America presented by some on the other side of the aisle. Though he denied he was taking a personal swipe at Republican nominee Donald Trump, Obama warned that people who use \u201cloose\u201d language about terrorism and Islam and propose greater scrutiny of US Muslims were on a \u201cslippery slope.\u201d His last question was about two people dear to his hearts who will also set out on a new path when the family leaves the White House in January. Asked how he would respond if either of his daughters Malia and Sasha said they wanted to join the military, he said: \u201cI\u2019d say, go for it.\u201d But he admitted he would share the anxiety many military families feel when their loved ones, particularly children, are deployed. \u201cI\u2019d be lying if I said I wouldn\u2019t sometimes get nervous about possible deployments,\u201d he told the audience. \u201cYour kids are your kids and you want to keep them tucked in in their pajamas for the rest of your lives if you had the chance.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Clinton put Trump on defense the defense on the issues most likely to damage his White House campaign Trump started out strong and made effective points on the economy, trade and jobs Hillary Clinton showed up at the debate of the century and delivered. Donald Trump started out strong, then struggled. The Democratic and Republican nominees waged a fiery battle Monday night when they appeared on stage together for the first time \u2013 a clash of two famous personalities locked in a dead heat for the presidency. During one of the most highly anticipated debates in modern political history, the candidates drew sharp contrasts on temperament, character and policy and starkly different visions of where they would lead the nation. 6 takeaways from the first presidential debate Clinton had the better night, repeatedly putting the Republican nominee on defense on the issues most likely to damage his White House campaign \u2013 his refusal to release his taxes, his past comments on race and his attitude toward women. By Tuesday morning, Clinton knew she came out on top. During a gaggle with reporters on her plane, Clinton taunted Trump\u2019s complaint that the microphone at his podium was \u201cdefective.\u201d \u201cAnybody who complains about the microphone is not having a good night.\u201d Trump started out strong and made effective points on the economy, trade and jobs that were uncomfortable at times for his rival. He put Clinton in a tight spot as he repeatedly accused her of being in Washington for 30 years and of doing little to improve the economic health of Americans, a line that could resonate in key swing states such as Pennsylvania and Ohio. The first presidential debate But he appeared to fade as the night wore on, failing to effectively press Clinton on her deepest vulnerabilities on her private emails server and long history of ethical questions. The debate, at Hofstra University on New York\u2019s Long Island, came at a critical point of the campaign: Trump has grabbed momentum in national polls and narrowed the race in some of the most decisive swing states. The debate had the potential for him to build on that momentum with 42 days remaining before Election Day. QUIZ: Are you more like Clinton or Trump? But the first results indicated that Clinton won. A CNN/ORC poll after the clash showed Clinton had a commanding victory, by 62% to 27%. The poll suggested the debate audience was a bit more Democratic than the public as a whole, about on par with the Democratic tilt in the audience that watched the first debate in 2008 between Barack Obama and John McCain. In all, 68% of those asked said Clinton had a better understanding of the issues, while 27% said the same of Trump. Asked whether Trump could handle the presidency, 55% said no. Clinton vs. Trump: The most memorable one-liners It will be several days, however, until conventional wisdom about the result of the showdown gels and its impact on the campaign becomes evident. Trump appeared to do nothing to shake the strong faith in his campaign among his core supporters, though the Republican nominee may have failed to broaden his coalition among key voting blocks, minorities and women. The showdown came at a critical point in the race. Another CNN/ORC poll released Monday found Trump edging Clinton 42% to 41% in the crucial battleground state of Colorado among likely voters in a four-way race. In Pennsylvania, another key state, the poll found Clinton in a virtual tie against Trump among likely voters at 45% to 44%. The former secretary of state is relying on both states to help pave her way to the 270 electoral votes needed to win the White House. Nationally, CNN\u2019s Poll of Polls finds Clinton and Trump neck-and-neck 44%-42%. Both candidates clearly understood that the central question of Monday\u2019s debate was about who had the right temperament and character to serve as President of the United States. Clinton delivered the best zinger of the night in response to criticism from Trump for staying off the campaign trail recently. \u201cI think Donald just criticized me for preparing for this debate,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd yes, I did. And you know what else I prepared for? I prepared to be President. And that is a good thing.\u201d Clinton also repeatedly brought attention to Trump\u2019s reputation for spreading falsehoods and repeatedly tried to needle him, at one point blasting his \u201ctrumped up, trickle down\u201d economics. CNN\u2019s Reality Check Team vets the claims at the first debate Trump, however, said he was much better suited to the burdens of the Oval Office. \u201cI have a winning temperament, I know how to win. She does not know how to win,\u201d he said. The billionaire skewered Clinton on her past support for the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade deal, which she declared the \u201cgold standard\u201d when she was secretary of state but now opposes. Clinton\u2019s team was clearly delighted with their candidate\u2019s performance, declaring her the clear winner.  Trump appeared in the \u201cspin room\u201d as soon as the 90 minute debate was over, telling CNN\u2019s Dana Bash \u201cit went better than I ever thought.\u201d He also told reporters his microphone wasn\u2019t working and questioned whether that was happening on purpose. Trump speaks out on taxes, birther movement Often in presidential debates, the atmospherics and body language are as important to winning over undecided voters as what the candidates say. On that score, Clinton went out of her way to appear unruffled and calm. She often responded to Trump\u2019s attacks with smiles and laughs. She pointedly repeatedly referred to Trump as \u201cDonald\u201d \u2013 in an apparent bid to cut him down to size, not using the moniker \u201cMr. Trump\u201d that he prefers. Trump, while passionate and engaged, also appeared to play into concerns about his personality. He often spoke loudly over Clinton in a way that could have come across as condescending, apparently falling short of his goal to appear more presidential than his rival. Monday\u2019s event was Trump\u2019s first ever one-on-one political debate \u2013 and he has two more showdowns with Clinton to change the political narrative before the election. There have been several instances of candidates recovering from an underwhelming first debate to recapture momentum and win the presidency in November. One of the most powerful moments of the debate came when the conversation focused on the so-called birther debate following Trump\u2019s recent acknowledgment that President Barack Obama was born in the US \u2013 a fact that has been evident for years. With Trump standing just a few feet from her, Clinton blasted him for perpetuating a \u201cracist lie.\u201d Donald Trump's empire \u201cHe has a long record of engaging in racist behavior,\u201d Clinton said as Trump shook his head. Trump hit back, noting Clinton\u2019s tough critiques of Obama during their bitter 2008 primary battle. \u201cYou treated him with terrible disrespect and I watch the way you talk now about how lovely everything is \u2026 it doesn\u2019t work that way,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you try to act holier than thou, it really doesn\u2019t work.\u201d As the debate ended, Clinton hammered Trump over his treatment of women. \u201cThis is a man who has called women pigs, slobs and dogs,\u201d Clinton said. She accused Trump of calling a Latina contestant in a beauty contest \u201cMiss Piggy\u201d and a housekeeper because of her ethnicity, seemingly throwing Trump off as he twice asked \u201cWhere did you find this?\u201d Clinton: Trump called women pigs, slobs and dogs Who is Alicia Machado? Former Miss Universe said Trump called her Miss Piggy He kept the story alive Tuesday morning when he slammed the contestant during an interview on \u201cFox and Friends.\u201d \u201cThat person was a Miss Universe person. And she was the worst we ever had,\u201d Trump said. \u201cShe was the winner and you know, she gained a massive amount of weight and it was a real problem.\u201d His comments recalled Trump\u2019s showdown with the family of fallen US Army captain Humayun Khan whose father had attacked him at the Democratic convention, prompting the Republican nominee to get into a damaging back and forth which prolonged the controversy. During the debate, Clinton repeatedly sought to correct Trump\u2019s statements \u2013 going so far as referring viewers to fact checks on her website \u2013 as she aimed to portray him as out of touch with the complexities of the American economy. \u201cI know you live in your own reality,\u201d she told Trump. Clinton and Trump opened the debate on a positive note by shaking hands before stationing themselves behind their podiums. Their spouses, former President Bill Clinton and Melania Trump, also greeted each other before taking their seats in the debate hall. From there, the drama quickly unfolded. An increasingly angry Trump slammed Clinton for putting her plans to fight ISIS on her website \u2013 and thereby tipping off America\u2019s enemy. \u201cWell, at least I have a plan to fight ISIS,\u201d Clinton responded, referring to his previous statements that he has a \u201csecret\u201d plan to destroy the terrorist group. Clinton also hit Trump over his refusal to release his tax returns. \u201cWhy won\u2019t he release his tax returns?\u201d Clinton asked. \u201cMaybe he is not as rich as he says he is,\u201d she went on. \u201cMaybe he is not as charitable as he claims to be. \u2026 Maybe he doesn\u2019t want the American people to know that he has paid nothing in federal taxes.\u201d Trump: \u2018I\u2019m smart\u2019 for not paying taxes Clinton pressed Trump on the issue, saying \u201cThere is something he is hiding.\u201d Trump: I'm 'smart' for paying no taxes Trump replied that he would release his taxes when Clinton made public 33,000 emails that were deleted from her private email server. When Clinton said that Trump had paid no federal income tax in some years, Trump replied, \u201cThat makes me smart.\u201d Clinton also set about Trump\u2019s business record, pointing out that he had called himself \u201cThe King of Debt\u201d and accusing him of \u201cstiffing\u201d thousand of contractors who did work for his business. When the debate turned to racial issues and crime, Clinton said that it was important for police to work together with local communities to restore trust. Trump accused Clinton of refusing to say the phrase \u201claw and order\u201d and bemoaned the state of inner cities. He said that African-Americans and Hispanics were \u201cliving in hell.\u201d \u201cYou walk down the street, you get shot,\u201d Trump said.

            "article_content": "Watch the first presidential debate Monday night at 9 p.m. ET on CNN, CNNgo and CNN.com. Trump repeats inaccurate statements on birther controversy, support for Iraq War Clinton on Trump: 'He has a long record of engaging in racist behavior' Hillary Clinton forced Donald Trump onto defense over his temperament, refusal to release his taxes and his past comments about race and women during a fiery debut presidential debate Monday \u2013 a potentially pivotal moment in a tight election campaign. Clinton, who has seen her dominance of the presidential race fade in the weeks since the Democratic convention, delivered a strong performance in which she demonstrated a command of policy and a sense of humor, smiling through some of Trump\u2019s strongest attacks. She delivered the best zinger of the night in response to criticism from Trump for staying off the campaign trail recently. \u201cI think Donald just criticized me for preparing for this debate,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd yes, I did. And you know what else I prepared for? I prepared to be President. And that is a good thing.\u201d Trump came out swinging at the beginning of the debate, and made some effective points on the economy and jobs \u2013 some of the aspects of his outsider presidential campaign that have struck a chord with many Americans. But the debate highlighted Trump\u2019s tendency to make false claims as he made inaccurate statements on everything from laws regarding policing, his support for the Iraq War and his contention that Clinton was behind the so-called birther conspiracy. CNN\u2019s Reality Check Team vets the claims at the first debate Appearing in the \u201cspin room\u201d after the debate to talk to journalists, Trump said he was happy with his performance. Trump speaks out on taxes, birther movement \u201cIt went better than I ever thought,\u201d he told CNN\u2019s Dana Bash. A CNN/ORC poll of debate watchers released after the event found 62% felt Clinton won compared to 27% for Trump. The poll suggests the debate audience was a bit more Democratic than the public as a whole, about on par with the Democratic tilt in the audience that watched the first debate in 2008 between Obama and John McCain. One of the most powerful moments of the debate came when the conversation focused on the so-called birther debate following Trump\u2019s recent acknowledgment that President Barack Obama was born in the US \u2013 a fact that has been evident for years. With Trump standing just a few feet from her, Clinton blasted him for perpetuating a \u201cracist lie.\u201d \u201cHe has a long record of engaging in racist behavior,\u201d Clinton said as Trump shook his head. Trump hit back, noting Clinton\u2019s tough critiques of Obama during their bitter 2008 primary battle. \u201cYou treated him with terrible disrespect and I watch the way you talk now about how lovely everything is \u2026 it doesn\u2019t work that way,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you try to act holier than thou, it really doesn\u2019t work.\u201d Clinton: Trump called women pigs, slobs and dogs As the debate ended, Clinton hammered Trump over his treatment of women. \u201cThis is a man who has called women pigs, slobs and dogs,\u201d Clinton said. She accused Trump of calling a Latina contestant in a beauty contest \u201cMiss Piggy\u201d and a housekeeper because of her ethnicity, seemingly throwing Trump off as he twice asked \u201cWhere did you find this?\u201d Who is Alicia Machado? Former Miss Universe said Trump called her Miss Piggy Clinton repeatedly sought to correct Trump\u2019s statements \u2013 going so far as referring viewers to fact checks on her website \u2013 as she aimed to portray him as out of touch with the complexities of the American economy. \u201cI know you live in your own reality,\u201d she told Trump. Clinton and Trump opened the debate on a positive note by shaking hands before stationing themselves behind their podiums at Hofstra University on New York\u2019s Long Island. Their spouses, former President Bill Clinton and Melania Trump, also greeted each other before taking their seats in the debate hall. Hillary Clinton's life in the spotlight From there, the drama quickly unfolded. An increasingly angry Trump slammed Clinton for putting her plans to fight ISIS on her website \u2013 and thereby tipping off America\u2019s enemy. \u201cWell, at least I have a plan to fight ISIS,\u201d Clinton responded, referring to his previous statements that he has a \u201csecret\u201d plan to destroy the terrorist group. Clinton also hit Trump over his refusal to release his tax returns. \u201cWhy won\u2019t he release his tax returns?\u201d Clinton asked. \u201cMaybe he is not as rich as he says he is,\u201d she went on. \u201cMaybe he is not as charitable as he claims to be,\u201d \u201cMaybe he doesn\u2019t want the American people to know that he has paid nothing in federal taxes.\u201d Clinton pressed Trump on the issue, saying \u201cThere is something he is hiding.\u201d Trump: I'm 'smart' for paying no taxes Trump replied that he would release his taxes when Clinton made public 33,000 emails that were deleted from her private email server. When Clinton said that Trump had paid no federal income tax in some years, Trump replied \u201cThat makes me smart.\u201d Clinton also set about Trump\u2019s business record, pointing out that he had called himself \u201cThe King of Debt\u201d and accusing him of \u201cstiffing\u201d thousand of contractors who did work for his business. When the debate turned to racial issues and crime, Clinton said that it was important for police to work together with local communities to restore trust. Trump accused Clinton of refusing to say the phrase \u201claw and order\u201d and bemoaned the state of inner cities. He said that African-Americans and Hispanics were \u201cliving in hell.\u201d \u201cYou walk down the street, you get shot,\u201d Trump said. Clinton rebuked Trump for painting \u201csuch a dire picture\u201d of black communities. Trump and Clinton are facing off with the campaign at a critical point, as the race is a dead heat just 43 days before Election Day. A CNN/ORC poll released Monday found Trump edging Clinton 42% to 41% in the crucial battleground state of Colorado among likely voters in a four-way race. In Pennsylvania, another key state, the poll found Clinton in a virtual tie against Trump among likely voters at 45% to 44%. The former secretary of state is relying on both states to help pave her way to the 270 electoral votes needed to win the White House. Nationally, CNN\u2019s Poll of Polls finds Clinton and Trump neck-and-neck 44%-42%. The rivals spent the day preparing for their big battle. Clinton participated in mock debates with her tart-tongued former aide Philippe Reines playing Trump. In one practice debate, Reines assumed the character of the unpredictable nominee by praising Clinton for her role as a pioneer for women, campaign sources said. Donald Trump's empire Reines even wore the kind of signature red tie that Trump favors and adopted his characteristic hand gestures in a bid to fully prepare Clinton for her unpredictable foe. The Republican nominee has watched videos of Clinton, but his preparation has been less intense than his opponent\u2019s, in keeping with his more freewheeling style. He did not hold mock debates, for instance, with someone standing in for Clinton. CNN\u2019s Dana Bash, Dylan Byers and Sara Murray contributed to this report",

I have resigned as the volunteer campaign chair in Mahoning County and as an elector to the Electoral College to avoid any unnecessary distractions.\u201d Miller told The Guardian in an interview that she blamed Obama for exacerbating racial tension. \u201cIf you\u2019re black and you haven\u2019t been successful in the last 50 years, it\u2019s your own fault. You\u2019ve had every opportunity,\u201d Miller told the publication. \u201cI don\u2019t think there was any racism until Obama got elected. We never had any problems like this,\u201d Miller said. \u201cNow, with the people with guns and shooting up neighborhoods and not being responsible citizens, that\u2019s a big change, and I think that\u2019s the philosophy Obama has perpetuated on America.\u201d Miller also wholly rejected the premise of systemic racism. \u201cYou\u2019ve had the same schools everybody else went to. You had benefits to go to college that white kids didn\u2019t have. You had all the advantages and didn\u2019t take advantage of it. It\u2019s not our fault, certainly,\u201d she said. The Trump campaign announced that Tracey Winbush, an African-American radio host, will take over Miller\u2019s duties. According to a 2013 census report, black voters voted at the highest rate of any race in the 2012 presidential election.",

The author works at the institute. EJ Dionne said he sees some racism behind the anger driving Trump supporters He argued that fear of Trump can be as powerful a motivator as hope for Clinton While much of Donald Trump\u2019s support stems from widespread anger about the country\u2019s economic divide, there is another element fueling the GOP nominee\u2019s success, says long-time Washington Post political columnist EJ Dionne: racism. \u201cPeople out there who are angry did not make up their reasons for being angry. There is a legitimacy to their protests,\u201dDionne told David Axelrod on \u201cThe Axe Files\u201d podcast, produced by the University of Chicago Institute of Politics and CNN. The conversation was recorded last week, hours before Hillary Clinton gave her much-quoted remarks at a New York City fundraiser at which she depicted half of Trump\u2019s supporters as belonging to a \u201cbasket of deplorables,\u201d driven by their biases to support his candidacy. But Dionne asserted his own view that Trump\u2019s appeal was a play to prejudice. Race and racism in the 2016 campaign \u201cBut we will also have to look back and say what part of the Trump movement was not primarily about this economic protest, but really was\u2026 people who are uneasy with the changes in the country, with the changes in the culture? And then in the case of a piece of it, you know, outright racism,\u201d Dionne said. \u201cWhat was birtherism if not something that played at racial feeling in the country?\u201d During the hour-long conversation with Axelrod, Dionne, author of the new book \u201cWhy the Right Went Wrong\u201d, said that in this bitter campaign, Hillary Clinton would have to rely, in part, on fears of a Trump presidency to drive turnout in her favor on Election Day. \u201cThe question is will she get enough turnout from the old Obama coalition, particularly from African-Americans who turned out in record numbers for President Obama, to some degree from Latinos, and then also from [Bernie Sanders supporters] and young people? I think Trump\u2019s radicalism or extremism, the sense of threat people feel from the possibility of a Trump presidency, can inspire a lot of turnout,\u201d Dionne told Axelrod. \u201cWe forget that sometimes fear inspires at least as much turnout as hope. I think Trump sort of strikes fear in the hearts of a lot of not only traditional Democrats but middle of the road Republicans.\u201d To hear the full interview with Dionne, which also touched on his start in journalism and the Catholic Church under Pope Francis, click on http://podcast.cnn.com.

            "article_content": "Both parties make-up has shifted The changes are fueled partly by demographic shifts The Democratic Party that selected Hillary Clinton to be its nominee this year has a drastically different demographic profile than the one that chose her husband to top the ticket in 1992. And so, too, does the Republican Party that emerged from the Reagan era scarcely resemble the one that today selected Donald Trump as its standard bearer. Amid changes fueled partly by demographic shifts in the United States and partly by increasing polarization within those groups, a new report from the Pew Research Center finds America\u2019s two major political parties look almost nothing like they did a quarter century ago when Democrat Bill Clinton was first elected to the White House. As voting age population has grown increasingly non-white, older, and better educated, so too have the two major parties. But the analysis finds that the country\u2019s changing demographics have made the two parties farther apart rather than closer together even as the share of Democrats and Republicans in the nation\u2019s voter pool holds fairly steady. Overall, more Americans say they are Democrats or Democratic-leaners (48%) than that they affiliate with the Republican Party or lean toward it (44%). Those figures have held roughly steady since 2008, but reflect a more Republican-friendly electorate than in 1992 (then 51% were Democrats or Democratic-leaning vs. 41% Republican/Republican-leaning). The demographic groups that make up those coalitions have shifted sharply in the last 24 years. Among those who identify as Democrats or say they lean toward the Democratic Party, 57% are white, down from 76% across Pew\u2019s surveys in 1992. Among Republicans and Republican-leaners, that change has been far less drastic, from 93% white in 1992 to 86% now. Black (21%) and Hispanic (12%) voters make up about one-third of the Democratic voter pool, compared with just 8% among Republicans (2% are black and 6% Hispanic). Within those racial and ethnic groups, Republicans have been gaining ground among white non-Hispanic voters, and now hold a larger advantage over Democrats in terms of party identification among whites than at any point since 1992, according to Pew\u2019s analysis. That long-term shift toward the Republican side among whites comes almost entirely from shifting partisan views among men. In 1992, 48% of white men considered themselves Republicans or leaned toward the Republican Party. Now, 61% do. Among white women, the share who are Republican or Republican-leaning has tilted from 44% in 1992 to 47% now. At the same time, the increase in non-whites among the Democratic coalition over that time stems largely from the growing numbers of blacks and Hispanics in the voter pool more than an increase in support for Democrats among those groups. The yawning chasm between white voters with college degrees and those without them has been a central focus of the 2016 election, and that divide reflects the changing core of each party. While a majority of Democrats and Democratic-leaners in 1992 were whites without college degrees (59%), they make up just one-third of the party now (32%). And Democrats are actually now more apt to be college graduates than are Republicans, a reversal since 1992. College graduates have grown as a share of the population over that time, and have shifted increasingly toward the Democrats, according to the Pew analysis. While 45% of college graduates considered themselves Democrats or leaned toward the Democratic Party in 1992, that stands at 53% today. Among those with a high school education or less, the figures are almost exactly reversed, from 55% Democratic in 1992 to 46% today. That divide has widened especially in the last eight years, driven by a steep increase in Republican affiliation among whites with no more than a high school education. Among that group, 59% say they are Republicans or lean that way, while just 33% are Democrats or Democratic-leaners. As recently as 2007, the Democrats narrowly outnumbered the Republicans among this group, 46% to 42%. On the opposite end of the scale, those who have completed at least some postgraduate coursework have gone from a slight-Democratic tilt in 1992 (50% leaned Democratic, 45% Republican) to a wide 59% to 36% chasm now. The population overall is aging, and both parties have aged accordingly. The Baby Boom generation has tilted the GOP older, while Millennials are helping to minimize aging among the Democrats. Boomers now tilt slightly Republican (49% to 45%), and members of the silent generation (those age 71 to 88) are increasingly Republican, according to Pew\u2019s data (53% GOP or GOP-leaning vs. 40% Democratic). At the same time, Gen X\u2019ers and Millennials are tilting a bit more toward the Democrats in recent years, helping to offset the overall aging of the population. Although Millennials are a broadly Democratic-leaning group, with 57% saying they see themselves as Democrats or lean that way, they are also more apt than older voters to consider themselves political independents and merely lean toward a party, suggesting their partisan ties are weakest. The Pew report is based on the results of 253 surveys conducted by telephone by the Pew Research Center from 1992 through 2016. The 2016 results reflect interviews with 8,113 registered voters through August of this year. The margin of error for overall results in the 2016 data is 1.2 percentage points, it is larger for subgroups.",

            "article_content": "Federal says the flag is a \"symbol of Old Mississippi -- the Mississippi of slavery, lynchings, pain and white supremacy\" The ruling will be appealed to the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals this week Carlos Moore, a Mississippi attorney, lost his battle last week to have the state\u2019s flag \u2013 that includes the Confederate battle emblem \u2013 declared unconstitutional. But he believes his fight \u2013 that triggered a provocative opinion from a federal district court judge \u2013 has just begun. \u201cTo millions of people, particularly African-Americans, the Confederate battle emblem is a symbol of Old Mississippi \u2013 the Mississippi of slavery, lynchings, pain and white supremacy,\u201d wrote U.S. District Court Judge Carlton W. Reeves in an opinion on Thursday. \u201cThe emblem offends more than just African-Americans,\u201d he added, \u201cit is difficult to imagine how a symbol borne of the South\u2019s intention to maintain slavery can unite Mississippians in the 21st century.\u201d While making clear his disdain for the flag, Reeves who was appointed to the bench by President Barack Obama in 2010, said he had to dismiss Moore\u2019s case on a procedural issue. Reeves said that Moore did not have the \u201cstanding,\u201d or legal right to be in court. Reeves held that Moore couldn\u2019t show a \u201ccognizable legal injury\u201d necessary to bring the case. But the judge left open the possibility that another case could be brought or \u201cthe people themselves\u201d could act to change the flag. \u201cToday, Mississippi stands alone,\u201d Reeves wrote, \u201cit is the only state to include the notorious \u2018stars and bars\u2019 in its official flag.\u201d \u201cAt times there is something noble in standing alone,\u201d Reeves continued. \u201cThis is not one of those times.\u201d Moore said in an interview that he was disappointed that the judge blocked his case from going forward, and he plans to file an appeal this week with the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals. But he believes from a historical perspective the judge \u201chit the nail on the head.\u201d \u201cWhile he dismissed my lawsuit, he definitely left the door open and seemed to be receptive to others challenging the constitutionality of the state flag in the federal court, or to the voters themselves,\u201d he said. Moore has also attention of a lawyer from a Philadelphia law firm. \u201cI think the judge did a remarkable job of exploring and laying out the historic context of which the flag arose, the way the flag has been used for a more than a century and laying out why it is wrong to have a state incorporate that emblem into its official state flag. However, the judge interpreted \u2018standing\u2019 in a way that is not consistent with Supreme Court precedent,\u201d said the new lawyer, Michael T. Scott of Reed, Smith. Moore argues in court briefs that the flag is \u201ctantamount to hateful government speech that both has a discriminatory intent and disparate impact and violates the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment.\u201d The lawsuit targets Gov. Phil Bryant. Bryant was not required to answer Moore\u2019s allegations, but his office filed a motion to dismiss arguing that Moore\u2019s complaint is \u201cdevoid of a single allegation that he has personally suffered a concrete and particularized injury.\u201d Lawyers for the state argued that while Moore may sincerely hold a belief that the flag \u201callegedly incites racial violence,\u201d such \u201cgeneralized fear of future injury is insufficient to confer standing.\u201d In court papers they stress that the Mississippi Supreme Court has weighed in on the issue and ruled that the decision to \u201cfly or adopt\u201d a state flag rests \u201d entirely with the political branches.\u201d Reeves\u2019 opinion walks through the flag and the state\u2019s history and discusses a case brought by the Mississippi State Conference of NAACP branches and individuals. In 2001, the Mississippi legislature set a special election where voters had the option of choosing an alternate design. According to Reeves, \u201cthe special election results substantially favored the 1894 flag.\u201d In January 2016, several bills were introduced regarding the flag, but they did not clear committee hurdles. Marc Allen, public affairs officer for the Mississippi Division of the Sons of Confederate Veterans, a group that says it works to honor the reputation of soldiers who fought for the confederacy during the Civil War says Reeves was right to dismiss the case, but he misrepresented the state\u2019s history. \u201cThis is not a federal judge issue, this is an issue for the people of the State of Mississippi to decide,\u201d Allen said. Allen calls the emblem \u201d a battle standard, it\u2019s what the confederate soldier looked to on the battlefield.\u201d \u201cI think the judge doesn\u2019t understand the history of what he is saying,\u201d Allen said. \u201cA lot of people will point to its use by hate groups, but if you use that logic, we also have to get rid of the Christian cross and the bible.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Clinton deliberately chose not to once utter Donald Trump's name Thursday night Clinton's aides think the former secretary of state needs to talk more about herself in personal terms Hillary Clinton ever so briefly hit pause Thursday on the personal insults and character attacks that have dominated the presidential election, as she discussed her faith and humility at a Baptist convention. Addressing a largely African-American congregation here, Clinton said, \u201cI\u2019ve made my share of mistakes\u201d \u2013 and deliberately chose not to once utter Donald Trump\u2019s name. \u201cHumility is not something you hear about much in politics, is it? But you should. None of us is perfect,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cI have learned to be grateful not just for my blessings but also for my faults \u2013 and there are plenty.\u201d Clinton\u2019s 30-minute speech, coming two months out from Election Day, demonstrated her campaign\u2019s efforts to inject more of the Democratic nominee\u2019s personal touches into the election narrative and get beyond the intensely negative headlines that have dominated the news. Clinton will look to draw attention to some of her policy platforms in the coming weeks by delivering a series of \u201cStronger Together\u201d speeches around the new book that she and running mate Tim Kaine published this week, Jennifer Palmieri, Clinton\u2019s spokeswoman, said Thursday. The speeches will speak to both what animates Clinton \u2013 faith, children and families \u2013 and how she will work to impact the economy and push national service. The push to get to a more positive message began Thursday with the speech in Kansas City. Clinton rarely touches on the issue of her faith and how it motivates her to serve. \u201cIt would have been easier to follow many of my law school classmates to a high-powered New York law firm, but the call to service rooted in my faith was just too powerful,\u201d she said. While Clinton didn\u2019t mention Trump directly in Kansas City, there were allusions to him, including his questioning of President Barack Obama\u2019s American citizenship. \u201cWe are facing a candidate with a long history of racial discrimination in his business, who traffics in toxic conspiracy theories like the lie that President Obama is not a true American,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cIf he doesn\u2019t respect all Americans, how can he serve all Americans?\u201d And the speech was not entirely devoid of contentious politics. Clinton addressed gun control, criminal justice reform and economic equality during her remarks. Clinton\u2019s second \u201cStronger Together\u201d speech will be in California on Tuesday, Palmieri said. Palmieri said the four speeches (with the possibility of adding more) would be \u201cmore about her than about him\u201d in an effort to ensure that \u201cwhat is at the core of Hillary\u201d is not lost in the coverage of \u201cthe controversial things that he says.\u201d Top Clinton aides worry that her responses to Trump\u2019s attacks have helped sullied her popularity numbers. An ABC News/Washington Post poll out late last month found that 56% of adults now view Clinton unfavorably. Sixty-three percent said the same about Trump, but what concerns Clinton\u2019s campaign is that her number is up 6% since early August. To combat that, Clinton\u2019s aides think the former secretary of state needs to take more about herself in personal terms and about her policies. \u201cMy experience is that we believe we have to work extra hard to make sure the positive notion of what she wants to do breaks through given the amount of interest that there is in what he says,\u201d Palmieri said. \u201cSo we recognize the reality of the cycle that we are living in and that we have to put more effort in doing that.\u201d One step in doing this: Having Clinton speak in softer, more humanizing formats such as the blog Humans of New York. Clinton sat down with the blog late last month and in comments published on Thursday, the former secretary of state expanded on perceptions that she can sometimes come off as \u201ccold or unemotional,\u201d describing her struggle to control her emotions without seeming \u201cwalled off.\u201d The comments come as Clinton\u2019s campaign is hitting NBC and Matt Lauer for the way he handled the 2016 \u201cCommander In Chief Forum\u201d in New York City Wednesday night. Upset over his lack of fact-checking of Trump, the Clinton campaign sent a fundraising email to their supporters hitting Lauer. Clinton\u2019s speeches will focus on laying out what is in the new Clinton campaign book, which has become a bit of a prop for Clinton on the campaign trail. In her first in-flight gaggle, Clinton held the book as a prop and she has mentioned it at a series of events since then. The book retails on Amazon for $10.98 and the campaign has said the proceeds will go to charity. When asked Thursday which charity, Palmieri said, \u201cNot the Clinton Foundation.\u201d",

The Republican nominee retweeted a supporter\u2019s post that the Democratic nominee \u201csaid a KKK member was her mentor.\u201d And speaking later in Des Moines, Iowa, he dredged up Clinton\u2019s use of the term \u201csuper predators\u201d in the 1990s to argue that he, not Clinton, offered African-Americans the best choice for president. Presidential candidates often misled by crowds they draw Trump\u2019s retweet and his latest appeals to black voters capped off a week of increasingly ugly and racially charged accusations between the two leading presidential candidates, during which Trump called Clinton a \u201cbigot\u201d and the Democratic nominee charged that Trump\u2019s campaign was built on \u201cprejudice and paranoia\u201d while also tying him to the KKK. \u201c@DiamondandSilk: Crooked Hillary getting desperate. On TV bashing Trump. @CNN, she forgot how she said a KKK member was her mentor,\u201d Trump tweeted Saturday. \"@DiamondandSilk: Crooked Hillary getting desperate. On TV bashing Trump. @CNN, she forgot how she said a KKK member was her mentor. Lynette Hardaway and Rochelle Richardson \u2013 better known as Diamond and Silk, two African-American sisters supporting Trump who frequently speak at his rallies \u2013 confirmed to CNN that the tweet referred to the late West Virginia Sen. Robert Byrd, a former KKK member whom Clinton mourned in 2010 as \u201ca true American original, my friend and mentor.\u201d \u201cDonald J. Trump can\u2019t help who embraces his campaign but Hillary Clinton could\u2019ve helped who she embraced,\u201d the duo said in a statement to CNN. A Trump spokesman, Jason Miller, declined to comment, and a message left with Clinton\u2019s campaign was not returned. Trump\u2019s surrogates in recent days have pointed to Clinton\u2019s relationship with Byrd in response to accusations that Trump\u2019s campaign stokes racial tensions. Thursday night, Trump supporter Scottie Nell Hughes also cited Byrd, telling CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper, \u201c(Clinton) sat there and praised Sen. Byrd saying that he was her mentor, that he should be respected and he was a leader of the KKK.\u201d And on Friday, Trump supporter Kayleigh McEnany, speaking to CNN\u2019s Jim Sciutto on \u201cThe Lead,\u201d said Trump\u2019s campaign was not engaging in Clinton\u2019s \u201cgutter politics.\u201d \u201cYou have heard no language to this level coming out of the Trump campaign,\u201d McEnany said. \u201cThey could be digging into her past with Robert Byrd.\u201d On Wednesday, Trump flatly labeled Clinton a \u201cbigot who sees people of color only as votes, not as human beings worthy of a better future.\u201d The Democrat soon after told Cooper that Trump \u201ccourted white supremacists\u201d and \u201cis someone who is very much peddling bigotry and prejudice and paranoia.\u201d The next day, she gave a speech in Nevada accusing Trump of \u201ctaking hate groups mainstream and helping a radical fringe take over the Republican Party.\u201d Donald Trump doubles down on Clinton 'bigot' comment Her running mate, Virginia Sen. Tim Kaine, picked up on that line of attack Friday, saying Trump was \u201cpushing\u201d the values of the KKK. He backed away from the comments on Saturday, telling reporters in Florida that Trump has some supporters \u201cconnected\u201d with the KKK who are \u201cclaiming him.\u201d Trump has described such attacks as attempts to \u201csmear\u201d his supporters. And recently, he\u2019s tried to reach out to African-American voters, describing black communities as filled with high crime and high unemployment and asking, \u201cWhat the hell do you have to lose?\u201d Trump sought again on Saturday to draw African-American voters \u2013 a reliably Democratic demographic \u2013 to his campaign, noting that \u201cRepublicans are the party of Abraham Lincoln\u201d and arguing that minorities would benefit from his presidency. \u201cNothing means more to me than working to make our party the home of the African-American vote once again,\u201d Trump said while speaking before a nearly all-white audience at Iowa Sen. Joni Ernst\u2019s \u201cRoast and Ride\u201d event. At the same event, he referenced Clinton\u2019s use of the term \u201csuper predators\u201d in 1996 to describe violent criminals, a term widely seen as racist and that Clinton has said she regretted using. \u201cBy the way, how quickly people have forgotten that Hillary Clinton called black youth \u2018super predators.\u2019 Remember that? \u2018Super predators.\u2019 And they were very, very insulted, but now people have forgotten,\u201d Trump said. Meanwhile, Clinton, in a statement Saturday commemorating the 53rd anniversary of the March on Washington, said \u201cthe stakes in this election are unlike any we have faced before.\u201d \u201cThose brave men and women who marched, and sat, and bled for civil rights in American must not have done so in vain,\u201d Clinton said, though she did not mention Trump\u2019s name. Before entering national politics, Byrd helped organize a 150-member chapter of the Klan in Sophia, West Virginia, in the early 1940s. He was chosen as the group\u2019s leader. Byrd wrote in his autobiography that he \u201creflected the fears and prejudices\u201d of those years and that he mainly joined the Klan because he identified with the hate group\u2019s anti-Communist politics. As a senator, Byrd spent more than 14 hours filibustering the 1964 Civil Rights Act, a decision he later regretted. \u201cI saw the act in the kaleidoscope of life, liberty and property,\u201d he told CNN\u2019s Dana Bash in 2006. \u201cThat was a different time. I\u2019m from the South, grew up in a Southern home \u2026 and it was that Southern atmosphere in which I grew up and with all of its prejudices and its feelings.\u201d Byrd told Bash he considered his involvement with the KKK \u201cthe greatest mistake of my life.\u201d He said he hoped young people learned from the mistakes of his youth. He even went so far as to apologize to then-Sen. Barack Obama in 2005 for his Klan membership.

            "article_content": "Clinton is painting Trump as outside the norm of American politics The \"alt-right\" is a unorganized group that pushes racist, homophobic and sexist content online Hillary Clinton issued a blistering takedown of Donald Trump Thursday, accusing him of racism and arguing that \u201cfringe\u201d elements have taken over the Republican Party. \u201cFrom the start, Donald Trump has built his campaign on prejudice and paranoia,\u201d Clinton said at a campaign rally here. \u201cHe\u2019s taking hate groups mainstream and helping a radical fringe take over the Republican Party. His disregard for the values that make our country great is profoundly dangerous.\u201d She added, \u201cThis is what I want to make clear today: A man with a long history of racial discrimination, who traffics in dark conspiracy theories drawn from the pages of supermarket tabloids and the far reaches of the Internet, should never run our government or command our military. Ask yourself: If he doesn\u2019t respect all Americans, how can he serve all Americans?\u201d Clinton attacking the alt-right \u2014 what is it? The comments \u2013 delivered in what could be a crucial swing state in November \u2013 mark a dramatic escalation in the war of words between Clinton and Trump. The Republican nominee flatly labeled her a \u201cbigot\u201d on Wednesday, prompting Clinton to tell CNN he was \u201ctaking a hate movement mainstream\u201d and was outside the norm of American politics. Trump offered a prebuttal in New Hampshire earlier Thursday, saying that Clinton \u201cpaints decent Americans as racists.\u201d \u201cShe bullies voters who only want a better future and tries to intimidate them out of voting for a change,\u201d Trump said at a campaign event in Manchester. \u201cHillary Clinton isn\u2019t just attacking me, she\u2019s attacking all of the decent people of all backgrounds \u2013 doesn\u2019t matter \u2013 of all backgrounds who support this incredible, once in a lifetime movement.\u201d He later tweeted after her remarks, \u201cHillary Clinton\u2019s short speech is pandering to the worst instincts in our society. She should be ashamed of herself!\u201d Hillary Clinton's short speech is pandering to the worst instincts in our society. She should be ashamed of herself! Asked by WMUR in Manchester later Thursday if he wanted white supremacists to vote for him, Trump simply responded, \u201cNo. I don\u2019t at all.\u201d Speaking at a community college, Clinton sought to link Trump to the \u201calt-right,\u201d an informal group of mostly white conservative men aligned with the Republican Party that sees Trump as the only choice in 2016. The \u201calt-right\u201d lives primarily online, regularly pushing racist, homophobic and sexist content. Trump, however, has been embraced by the fringe groups, in part because he tapped Steve Bannon, the former head of Breitbart News, as the CEO of his campaign. Bannon has said that his former publication is \u201cthe platform of the alt-right.\u201d Clinton says Trump leading \u2018hate movement\u2019; he calls her a \u2018bigot\u2019 Clinton said the Bannon hire has led to a \u201cde facto merger\u201d between Breitbart and the Trump campaign represents a \u201clandmark achievement\u201d for a \u201cfringe element that has effectively taken over the Republican Party.\u201d \u201cAll of this adds up to something we\u2019ve never seen before,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cOf course there\u2019s always been a paranoid fringe in our politics, steeped in racial resentment. But it\u2019s never had the nominee of a major party stoking it, encouraging it, and giving it a national megaphone. Until now.\u201d Clinton devoted large portions of her speech to making overtures to Republicans, calling this election \u201ca moment of reckoning for every Republican dismayed that the party of Lincoln has become the party of Trump.\u201d \u201cThis is not conservatism as we have known it. This is not Republicanism as we have known it,\u201d Clinton said, departing from her prepared remarks. \u201cWe have our disagreements. We need good debates. Need to do it in respectful way. Not finger- pointing. Every day, more Americans are standing up and saying \u201cenough is enough\u201d \u2013 including a lot of Republicans,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cI\u2019m honored to have their support. And I promise you this: With your help, I will be a president for Democrats, Republicans and Independents. For those who vote for me and those who don\u2019t. For all Americans.\u201d The Democratic nominee also praised former Republicans who had denounced racism. \u201cTwenty years ago, when Bob Dole accepted the Republican nomination, he pointed to the exits and told any racists in the party to get out. The week after 9/11, George W. Bush went to a mosque and declared for everyone to hear that Muslims \u2018love America just as much as I do.\u2019 In 2008, John McCain told his own supporters they were wrong about the man he was trying to defeat. Senator McCain made sure they knew Barack Obama is an American citizen and \u2018a decent person.\u2019 \u201cWe need that kind of leadership again,\u201d Clinton said. In a video published on Thursday, the Clinton campaign links clips of KKK members, including Duke, backing Trump. It also highlights Trump failing to disavow the support in an interview with CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper. The video then cuts to media clips of Bannon joining the Trump campaign with a reporter describing the alt-right as \u201csort of dressed-up-in-suits version of the neo-Nazi and white supremacist movement.\u201d Trump\u2019s campaign denounced the ad as a \u201cdisgusting new low.\u201d \u201cThis type of rhetoric and repulsive advertising is revolting and completely beyond the pale,\u201d Trump surrogate Pastor Mark Burns said in a statement. \u201cI call on Hillary Clinton to disavow this video and her campaign for this sickening act that has no place in our world.\u201d Trump spokesman Jason Miller described Clinton\u2019s attacks as a \u201cdesperation play.\u201d And Kayleigh McEnany, a Trump supporter, also told CNN\u2019s Brooke Baldwin that the real estate mogul has \u201crepeatedly disavowed\u201d Duke. \u201cWhat I saw was a mischaracterization of Donald Trump\u2019s record,\u201d McEnany said. But in an interview with CNN on Wednesday, Clinton was defiant in her characterization. \u201cDonald Trump has shown us who he is, and we ought to believe him. He is taking a hate movement mainstream. He\u2019s brought it into his campaign,\u201d Clinton told CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper. \u201cHe\u2019s bringing it to our communities and our country.\u201d Clinton added that \u201csomeone who\u2019s questioned the citizenship of the first African-American President, who has courted white supremacists, who\u2019s been sued for housing discrimination against communities of color, who\u2019s attacked a judge for his Mexican heritage and promised a mass deportation force, is someone who is very much peddling bigotry and prejudice and paranoia.\u201d Donald Trump: \u2018I want to do this my way\u2019 Kellyanne Conway, Donald Trump\u2019s campaign manager, rejected the idea that her candidate is the leader of the alt-right. \u201cWe\u2019ve never even discussed it internally,\u201d she said on CBS. \u201cIt certainly isn\u2019t a part of our strategy meetings. It\u2019s nothing that Mr. Trump says out on the stump.\u201d The fact Clinton is giving her speech in Reno, a traditionally red city in a key swing state, is significant as well. Washoe County, where Reno sits, is a key county for any Republican hoping to win Nevada. Clinton, more so than other swing states, has struggled to grow a lead in Nevada. Her campaign chalks the issues up to a smaller than average number of college educated white voters.

            "article_content": "With Hillary Clinton running to become the first female president, O'Connor's name has been in the air Over nearly 25 years on the bench, her legal reasoning set standards on a variety of issues She always insisted it was luck that led to her appointment as the first woman on the US Supreme Court. But Sandra Day O\u2019Connor was ready for her luck. She demonstrated that 35 years ago this summer when Reagan administration lawyers flew to Arizona to interview her as one of several candidates for a court vacancy. O\u2019Connor appeared an unlikely contender. She was a judge on a mid-level state court and little known beyond Arizona. But earlier, as the first woman state senate majority leader in the country, she had proven herself a shrewd operator in the backrooms of legislative politics. And a serendipitous connection had landed her on the administration\u2019s short list. With the first-ever nomination by a major party of a woman for president, judicial pioneer O\u2019Connor\u2019s name has been in the air. Now retired for a decade, she lives quietly at age 86 back in her home state, no longer making public appearances or engaged in the civics education and other projects she took on after she left the bench. Yet her legacy endures. In the recently completed Supreme Court term, significant rulings on abortion rights and university affirmative action relied on precedents crafted by O\u2019Connor. Justice Kennedy\u2019s evolution on race The high court, still missing a successor to the late Justice Antonin Scalia, has entered a new era of uncertainty. But with Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton dominating in the polls, there is a chance a first woman president\u2019s court appointments would protect those liberal-leaning precedents and extend the legacy of the first woman justice even longer. Neither Ronald Reagan\u2019s choice nor O\u2019Connor\u2019s influence might have been predicted at the outset. Her path 35 years ago demonstrates how a long-odds nominee gets skillfully positioned to enjoy the luck of presidential selection. When Supreme Court Justice Potter Stewart sent word that he would be retiring in 1981, Attorney General William French Smith turned to a list of names he had been collecting, including one on a pink telephone message slip he kept on his desk. Many of the possible nominees were women because Reagan, a Republican, had vowed in the heat of his 1980 challenge to Democratic President Jimmy Carter that he would appoint the first woman justice if elected. For two centuries, only men had sat on America\u2019s highest court. According to Smith\u2019s notes that I found in the Reagan presidential archive when writing a 2005 biography of O\u2019Connor, Smith had scrawled only her last name on the telephone slip. His aides were initially uncertain just who O\u2019Connor was. The original source of the Smith note is not fully known (Smith lost track of it after the nomination and has since died), but Fred Fielding, White House counsel, told me then-Chief Justice Warren Burger had been touting her to top administration officials. Burger had met O\u2019Connor in 1979 on a house boat vacation on Lake Powell in Utah with mutual friends. He was impressed and began involving her in extracurricular judicial projects on the national scene. O\u2019Connor had graduated from Stanford law school in 1952, near the top of her class, but been rejected for positions at large law firms. Women were simply not considered up to the task: one firm offered her a job as a legal secretary. She turned to public service, navigating a county attorney\u2019s office, the state legislature, then Arizona courts. Some posts came through political appointment; others required her to mount campaigns and win election. Along the way, she became a Republican Party loyalist, befriending US Sen. Barry Goldwater and co-chairing President Richard Nixon\u2019s 1972 re-election campaign in Arizona. Reared on a desolate ranch with a demanding father, O\u2019Connor was imbued with a rigorous work ethic and resilience. Smith later wrote that O\u2019Connor, \u201cboth in her looks and in her personality, had that same direct friendliness one associates with the wide-open territory where she lived.\u201d She also was a natural politician who could size up a room and valued the human touch. After Smith\u2019s team delved into her legislative and judicial record, the attorney general dispatched assistants Ken Starr and Jonathan Rose to Phoenix to interview her. Starr told me years later that he was surprised O\u2019Connor, sitting on an intermediate state court, had drawn Smith\u2019s interest. Chief Justice John Roberts\u2019 game of chess \u201cThere was a certain oddity to her being in the mix at all,\u201d he said. \u201cJudge O\u2019Connor was in Arizona, not on an impressive court, not in a key state. I was skeptical.\u201d But, he said, \u201cshe had clearly prepared for us.\u201d O\u2019Connor had boned up on constitutional issues and was ready for their questions about her judicial philosophy. On a lunch break, O\u2019Connor, who always understood the persuasive nature of a good meal, brought out a salmon mousse salad. After hearing details of their daylong session, attorney general Smith arranged for O\u2019Connor to fly to Washington to meet with him and key White House officials. Before the week was over, the 51-year-old O\u2019Connor was in the Oval Office with Reagan. The former California governor responded immediately to a woman who could converse about horses and constitutional rulings. On her courtesy calls with senators, she addressed their questions of legal substance and dropped in mentions to their individual backgrounds and legislative interests. She worked around the clock for her confirmation hearings. Leaving nothing to luck, she pored over piles of briefing books prepared by Department of Justice lawyers. One of those young attorneys helping prep her for questioning had just started on the job: John Roberts, who would eventually be appointed chief justice of the United States. O\u2019Connor was approved by a Senate vote of 99-0 on September 21 and took the oath of office four days later. Once on the court, she did not wait for her luck. As happened at the Arizona Capitol, she learned to count votes and broker consensus. Her moderate non-doctrinaire approach bridged her colleagues\u2019 dueling ideologies. Over nearly 25 years on the bench, her legal reasoning set standards for abortion rights, religious disputes and death penalty appeals. After she retired in January 2006, succeeded by the more conservative Samuel Alito, the court shifted to the right. Her opinions, including to uphold abortion rights and racial remedies, were scaled back. During a legal conference in 2009, O\u2019Connor complained that some of her decisions were \u201cbeing dismantled.\u201d Why Ruth Bader Ginsburg regrets her Trump comments When I asked how she felt about it, O\u2019Connor, then 79, said, \u201cWhat would you feel? I\u2019d be a little bit disappointed. If you think you\u2019ve been helpful, and then it\u2019s dismantled, you think, \u2018Oh dear.\u2019 But life goes on.\u201d Her frustration may be short-lived. The court since the February death of the conservative Scalia is shifting again. The majority\u2019s June decision endorsing a University of Texas affirmative action plan bolstered an opinion written by O\u2019Connor in a 2003 dispute from the University of Michigan. Similarly, the court\u2019s invalidation of a tough Texas abortion regulation relied on and reinforced a milestone decision O\u2019Connor wrote in 1992 with Justices Anthony Kennedy and David Souter. Especially striking was how much Kennedy, who authored the opinion upholding the Texas race-conscious admissions policy, drew from O\u2019Connor\u2019s 2003 decision in the Michigan case. He had dissented back then, yet in June highlighted her emphasis on the way campus diversity prepares students for today\u2019s increasingly diverse society. For her part, O\u2019Connor used to brush off questions about her influence. \u201cWe try to persuade by the strength of the argument,\u201d she told me. \u201cEveryone has a very key vote.\u201d Hers has lasted.",

            "article_content": "The largest progressive third party addressed voters on CNN Jill Stein and Ajamu Baraka are relatively unknown Green Party presidential nominee Jill Stein said Wednesday she doesn\u2019t believe either mainstream candidate is fit for the White House, brushing aside criticism that her bid could help elect Donald Trump. \u201cI will have trouble sleeping at night if Donald Trump is elected. I will also have trouble sleeping at night if Hillary Clinton is elected. And as despicable as Donald Trump\u2019s words are, I find Hillary Clinton\u2019s actions and track record is very troubling,\u201d said Stein, sitting alongside her running mate Ajamu Baraka at CNN\u2019s Green Party town hall event. The third-party candidate blasted the logic that voters should discount her candidacy, and citing her opposition to money in politics, Stein said that her party stood alone on the national scene totally independent of corporate influence. Anti-science claims dog Green Party\u2019s Jill Stein \u201cWe have the unique ability to actually stand up for what it is that the American people want, what everyday people want,\u201d Stein said. Stein, a retired medical doctor, environmental activist and musician, made a failed bid for the presidency in 2012, but this time around, she has said things are different. In this election cycle, the mainstream nominees have achieved historically poor favorability ratings from voters nationwide. Stein has seized on this point and focused her message on disaffected progressive voters in particular, reserving her sharpest critiques for Clinton. The Green Party nominee has said she hopes to reignite and build upon the \u201cpolitical revolution\u201d of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. In the latest CNN Poll of Polls, Stein was at 5% support nationwide, showing she has yet to break out. Part of this may owe to the lack of establishment support and little in the way of mainstream attention she has achieved. Despite her outreach to Sanders\u2019 supporters, Stein has been largely ignored \u2013 even after years\u2019 worth of effort \u2013 by Sanders himself. Who are the Green Party candidates? With that in mind, Stein and Barka spent Wednesday evening hoping to win over a national audience. Stein made clear, as she has her entire campaign, that she believes Clinton is not an acceptable choice for president. Stein hit her from the left, but she also made the case against Clinton on matters of trust. She implied Clinton was so well-connected as to be above the law. With regard to the former secretary of state\u2019s email controversy, Stein called Clinton \u201ctoo big to jail.\u201d Compounding her concerns with Clinton\u2019s character and alleged impropriety, Stein hit Clinton\u2019s record on foreign policy. \u201cI do have serious questions about Hillary\u2019s judgment, her safeguarding of national security information and above all, her trustworthiness in the job where she will have her finger on the button,\u201d Stein said. Ending the critique with an appeal to voters, Stein summarized: \u201cI have serious concerns about Hillary. That\u2019s why I\u2019m in this race \u2013 to provide an alternative.\u201d Stein also criticized Clinton\u2019s brand of feminism, by casting the Democrat as pro-war, and therefore anti-woman. \u201cThe war effort that Hillary has especially been the engine behind \u2026 To my mind, that\u2019s just not compatible with what my view of feminism is, that has a responsibility, not just to your own family, but to all families and to the human family,\u201d she said. Stein\u2019s running mate has criticized President Barack Obama extensively, and he outlined his disappointment with the president early on. \u201cYou have to basically call it as you see it and be prepared to speak truth to power,\u201d Baraka said. \u201cObama had an historic opportunity to transform this country.\u201d Baraka said the nation\u2019s first black president did not live up to his historic opportunity. \u201cHe allowed his commitment to neoliberal policies and a neoliberal worldview to undermine the possibility of greatness,\u201d Baraka said. Baraka did not demure when confronted with his more strident comments about Obama, like calling him an \u201cUncle Tom.\u201d \u201cIf we were concerned and serious about how we could displace white power, we had to demystify the policies and the positions of this individual,\u201d Baraka said, referring to his attempt to \u201cshock\u201d people out of faith in Obama\u2019s transformative potential. He conceded that his language sounded \u201cinflammatory\u201d to some, but said, \u201cI stand by that.\u201d Almost 15 years after September 11, Stein\u2019s recounting of the US\u2019 \u201cWar on Terror\u201d was one of a protracted and brutal failure. \u201cWe have a track record now of fighting terrorism \u2026 This track record is not looking so good,\u201d Stein said. \u201cWe have killed a million people in Iraq alone.\u201d After recounting the toll in money and human life the US\u2019 counterterror efforts, Stein said: \u201cWhat do we have to show for this? Failed states, mass refugee migrations and repeated terrorist threats.\u201d Certainly the most vocally anti-war candidates of the four top tickets, Stein called for a full rethinking of the United States\u2019 \u201cWar on Terror.\u201d \u201cWe are calling for a new kind of offensive, a peace offensive in the Middle East,\u201d Stein said. The \u201cpeace offensive\u201d would include an embargo on weapons sales and a freeze on funding to states that support \u201cjihadi terrorist enterprises,\u201d she said, pointing to Saudi Arabia in particular. She called for a massive cut in military spending, including the closure of many bases, a shutdown of the F-35 program and not moving forward with the modernization of the US nuclear weapons program. Stein is a graduate of Harvard Medical School and a retired medical doctor. But her outspokenness on medical issues and her unconventional statements on wireless internet and GMOs has led to criticism that she is at odds with science. Asked if she was anti-vaccine, Stein said she had been \u201ctaken out of context\u201d on the issue. \u201cI think there\u2019s kind of an effort to divert the conversation from our actual agenda,\u201d Stein said. \u201cThe idea that I oppose vaccines is completely ridiculous.\u201d In an attempt to brandish her scientific credentials, Stein talked about her medical and research experience. \u201cFor science geeks, you can show yourself if you have any doubt that I too am a science geek,\u201d Stein said. Near the event\u2019s close, the left-leaning ticket addressed pervasive racism in the United States. Stein cast the Black Lives Matter movement as a vital and logical response to the repeated deaths of African-Americans at the hands of police and violence disproportionately claiming the lives of people of color. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing a new tragedy unfold almost on a daily basis, so this is a crisis,\u201d Stein said, clarifying the crisis is the broader continuation of \u201cracial injustice\u201d in society. She called for a raft of measures to combat police violence, including civilian review boards and independent investigators. She also called for a \u201ctruth and reconciliation commission\u201d of the kind created in post-Apartheid South Africa, where the country attempted to grapple with its racist history. She said she wanted the US to reckon with its historic and systemic racism with the goal of eliminating disparities in income and health by race. Baraka, her running mate, said police violence was only one of symptom of the broader \u201csystem of oppression.\u201d \u201cA war is being waged against black people,\u201d Baraka said, calling the police the \u201cfront line\u201d of the country\u2019s oppressive system. He said the criminalization and violence black people had seen iss the result of an economic system that had marginalized them. \u201cIn the larger economy, we have become the problem people that (W.E.B.) du Bois talked about,\u201d Baraka said. \u201cThe way you deal with a problem people now, you police them, you incarcerate them, you kill them.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Watch CNN\u2019s town hall with Green Party nominee Jill Stein and her running mate, Ajamu Baraka, Wednesday at 9 p.m. ET. In the most recent CNN/ORC poll, Stein received 5% support Stein has consistently polled as the fourth-most popular option in the presidential race Despite record levels of dissatisfaction with the Republican and Democratic candidates, nearly 70% of Americans know nothing about the Green Party presidential hopeful Jill Stein, according to a recent Gallup poll. Stein has consistently polled as the fourth-most popular option in the presidential race after Hillary Clinton, Donald Trump and Libertarian Gary Johnson. In the most recent CNN/ORC poll, Stein received 5% support nationwide, 4 points behind Johnson, her nearest competitor. Stein and her running mate Ajamu Baraka hope to change that Wednesday at the CNN Green Party town hall. Occupation: Physician Age: 66 Past experience: She ran for president in 2012 with the Green Party and ran for Massachusetts governor in 2002 against former Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney. Stein also ran for state representative in 2004 and Massachusetts\u2019 secretary of state in 2006 as the Green-Rainbow candidate. Memorable quotes: \u201cIf Donald Trump wins, Hillary Clinton deserves the blame because she knocked out Bernie Sanders through backstabbing & sabotage. #DNCleaks,\u201d Stein tweeted. \u201cMy campaign is the only one that\u2019s not corrupted by lobbyists\u2019 money, corporate money or super PACs, so I have the unique ability to stand for what the people need, not the banks,\u201d she told CNN Tuesday.  \u201cI\u2019m here to really empower people to let them know we can actually have those solutions that we need in order to move forward.\u201d In the news: Earlier this month, Stein dismissed anxieties that Russia could have been behind the Democratic National Committee hacking that has raised concerns of a foreign state or actor meddling in the US presidential election. \u201cThis is routine,\u201d said Stein, who added that there was \u201cno question\u201d WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange is a hero. \u201cThis is what state departments do to one another.\u201d Surprising fact: Stein is a recording artist who has put out folk-rock recordings with the band Somebody\u2019s Sister. She plays the conga, guitar and the djembe drum. Top issues: Green jobs, campaign finance reform and increasing taxes on the wealthy. Occupation: Associate fellow at the Institute for Policy Studies, a left-leaning DC-based think tank Age: 62 Past experience: Founding executive director of the US Human Rights Network, a network of more than 300 human rights organizations; served on several boards of human rights organizations, including Amnesty International. Memorable quotes: \u201cWe\u2019ve got to address in a real way the ongoing assault on black lives in the United States of America,\u201d Baraka told CNN Tuesday. \u201cIt appears that police in the US seem to understand that they are able to operate with almost virtual impunity because they are not being prosecuted and they are not being convicted.\u201d \u201cIt is absolutely outrageous that we have a Democratic process in which we only have two choices and those choices are very, very narrow,\u201d he also told CNN. \u201cThe fact that Barack Obama will be standing in the shadow of Dr. (Martin Luther) King (Jr.), his presence conveying the impression that he somehow represents the values and self-sacrificing lives of Dr. King \u2026 should be taken as an insult by everyone who has struggled and continues to struggle for human rights, peace and social justice,\u201d he wrote prior to the 50th anniversary of the March on Washington. Surprising facts: Baraka has military experience, unlike the candidates on the major party tickets. He served in Vietnam in the US Army. In 1998, Baraka was one of 300 human rights workers honored by then-United Nations Secretary General Kofi Annan. Top issues: Criminal justice reform, ending racial discrimination and helping the working poor",

            "article_content": "Kennedy's evolution coincides with lower court decisions rejecting new voter restrictions He has become more aligned with liberal justices Supreme Court Justice Anthony Kennedy has long marched alongside Chief Justice John Roberts on race. That has changed. Kennedy\u2019s evolution has occurred against a backdrop of heightened national conflicts over race \u2013 on urban streets, on university campuses and in the presidential campaign \u2013 and as Kennedy approached age 80 and just finished his 29th term on the court. He has expressed new concerns about racial progress in his opinions, and the sentiment of this swing-vote justice could make a difference in future race cases, including those affecting voting rights and the ongoing litigation over state electoral rules. The Kennedy evolution coincides with recent lower court decisions rejecting new voter restrictions and implicitly calling into question the Supreme Court\u2019s glossy picture of life for blacks and Hispanics in its 2013 case that scaled back the landmark Voting Rights Act. Three years ago, the high court invalidated a portion of the 1965 act requiring federal review of proposed electoral changes in states with a history of discrimination, mainly in the South. In his opinion for the majority, Roberts voiced a repeated refrain that \u201cconditions that originally justified these measures no longer characterize voting \u2026 things have changed dramatically \u2026 the nation is no longer divided along those lines \u2026 history did not end in 1965\u2026 our country has changed.\u201d Chief Justice John Roberts\u2019 game of chess Lower court decisions in recent weeks, particularly a July 29 ruling against a North Carolina law that targeted black voters, have countered that positive vision. But any notion of robust racial progress might already have faded at the Supreme Court itself. Kennedy was one of the four conservatives who joined that 2013 Roberts\u2019 opinion in Shelby County v. Holder. Since then, in two major cases, Kennedy separated himself from the chief justice and was receptive to policies to remedy discrimination and encourage diversity. Kennedy has become more aligned with liberal justices, which could change the outcome of any new race case regardless of who eventually succeeds conservative Antonin Scalia, who died in February. Kennedy has been the decisive vote with liberals before, on watershed social issues such as on same-sex marriage. But on race, he typically joined conservatives. A 1988 appointee of President Ronald Reagan, Kennedy had voted against racial policies in employment, contracting and university admissions, as well as on redistricting and voter regulations. Anthony Kennedy fast facts There have been some difference with Roberts in the past, as in 2007 when Kennedy rejected public school policies that took account of students\u2019 race for district-wide diversity but did not go as far as Roberts in trying to bar such measures under all circumstances. Now, the variance is gaping and has made a difference in bottom-line rulings. A closer look at two cases that followed Shelby County reveals the change. In that 2013 decision freeing designated states from federal \u201cpreclearance\u201d for new election regulations, Kennedy joined Roberts\u2019 decision that emphasized the \u201cgreat strides\u201d made for racial minorities at the polls. Justices Scalia, Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito also joined. \u201cThings have changed in the South,\u201d Roberts wrote, echoing his view from a 2009 voting rights case. The federal appeals court that heard the recent North Carolina dispute observed that the day after the court dropped the preclearance requirement state legislators pushed for tougher voting rules. \u201cAfrican-Americans were poised to act as a major electoral force,\u201d the appeals court said, but then the legislature instituted a requirement for photo IDs that blacks disproportionately lacked and decreased the early-voting days that blacks used more often than whites. Justice Kennedy reflects on this year\u2019s tough cases, Scalia and \u2018Hamilton\u2019 The Supreme Court has not heard a voting case akin to the Shelby County, Alabama, dispute since 2013. In 2015, however, amid new racial turmoil sparked by shootings in Ferguson, Missouri, and elsewhere, Kennedy took a different position on racial progress as another civil rights law born of the 1960s came before the court. The new case, from Texas, tested whether the 1968 Fair Housing Act covered not only intentional bias but also claims of statistics-based indirect discrimination, for example, that blacks are more likely to be turned down for mortgage loans. The answer seemed a likely no, given the conservative majority\u2019s previous views on related issues. But Kennedy surprised lawyers on both sides of that fair housing case when he joined the four liberal justices to allow claims of indirect bias that, for example, keep minorities from buying homes in better neighborhoods. \u201cMuch progress remains to be made in our nation\u2019s continuing struggle against racial isolation,\u201d Kennedy wrote, as Roberts, Scalia, Thomas and Alito dissented. Another Kennedy shift emerged at the end of the recently completed term. He wrote June\u2019s decision upholding a University of Texas admissions policy giving a boost to black and Hispanic applicants. Veering from his sentiment in a 2003 University of Michigan case, Kennedy said a university has \u201cconsiderable deference\u201d to ensure student diversity. \u201cIt remains an enduring challenge to our nation\u2019s education system,\u201d he wrote, \u201cto reconcile the pursuit of diversity with the constitutional promise of equal treatment and dignity.\u201d Why Ruth Bader Ginsburg regrets her Trump comments It was the first time Kennedy voted to endorse a university\u2019s race-conscious admissions policy. Alito seemed to be calling out Kennedy when he wrote in a dissenting opinion that \u201csomething strange has happened\u201d since 2013 when the court first heard the case begun by Abigail Fisher, a white applicant who  failed to win a place at the flagship Austin campus.  Joined by Roberts and Thomas, Alito cited earlier Kennedy opinions against racial remedies. Now, it seems plain Kennedy would no longer sign unequivocally onto the rhetoric of racial progress woven throughout the Shelby County decision. And lower court judges\u2019 recent renderings of conditions for minorities might even give him pause about the necessary reach of the Voting Rights Act in America today.",

            "article_content": "Obama's speech sets up Hillary Clinton's address Thursday night He capped an evening that included Vice President Joe Biden President Barack Obama on Wednesday handed his legacy to Hillary Clinton, setting her up for the speech of her life with a powerful endorsement and the enduring image of a warm embrace. Clinton joined Obama on stage after his speech, and the President and his 2008 primary rival clung together in a shared moment of symbolism: the nation\u2019s first African-American leader entrusting its future to the woman who could become its first female commander-in-chief. Obama was in Philadelphia at the Democratic National Convention 12 years to the day after he shook politics with a convention speech in Boston that encouraged Americans to look at the common threads that unite them.  He offered a similarly empowering vision of the nation Wednesday, saying America doesn\u2019t need a \u201cself declared savior\u201d like Donald Trump to fix it. Undaunted by the experience of a presidency that unfolded in a time of crisis and deep ideological divides, he renewed his faith in the idea of a unified nation. The speech crystalized the two visions of America emerging this election season, following last week\u2019s Republican National Convention in which Trump blasted Obama for leaving the country divided and plagued by crime. Reality Check: DNC Day 3 \u201cThe America I know is full of courage, and optimism, and ingenuity,\u201d Obama said. \u201cThe America I know is decent and generous. Sure, we have real anxieties \u2013 about paying the bills, protecting our kids, caring for a sick parent. We get frustrated with political gridlock, worry about racial divisions; are shocked and saddened by the madness of Orlando or Nice.\u201d He went on: \u201cBut as I\u2019ve traveled this country, through all fifty states; as I\u2019ve rejoiced with you and mourned with you, what I\u2019ve also seen, more than anything, is what is right with America.\u201d Obama then made an impassioned case for Clinton, saying no man or woman had ever been as prepared to be president. \u201cNothing truly prepares you for the demands of the Oval Office,\u201d Obama said. \u201cBut Hillary\u2019s been in the room; she\u2019s been part of those decisions.\u201d He acknowledged Clinton had made mistakes, but compared her to Teddy Roosevelt\u2019s valiant striver who errs, but also knows great triumphs. \u201cHillary Clinton is that woman in the arena,\u201d Obama said. He also made an appeal to Bernie Sanders supporters who are still cool on Clinton. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to get in the arena with her, because democracy isn\u2019t a spectator sport,\u201d he said. Throughout the night, speaker after speaker leveled heated criticism of Trump aimed at undermining his image as a tough guy who understands Americans. Vice President Joe Biden painted Trump as completely unqualified for the presidency. \u201cHe is trying to tell us he cares about the middle class. Give me a break. That\u2019s a bunch of malarky,\u201d Biden said. \u201cThis guy doesn\u2019t have a clue about the Middle Class. Not a clue.\u201d The crowd roared with approval, chanting \u201cnot a clue.\u201d Biden said Trump was unable to handle the complexities of a dangerous world. Hillary Clinton\u2019s challenge: Excitement \u201cNo major party nominee in the history of this nation has ever known less or has been less prepared to deal with our national security,\u201d he said. Biden used his address on the third night of the Democratic National Convention to appeal to middle-class voters, a group Clinton is under pressure to win over. Leveraging his blue-collar bona fides, he argued Clinton is intimately familiar with the economic disenfranchisement that helped power Trump\u2019s rise. On Thursday, Trump told a crowd at a rally in Davenport, Iowa, the Democrats are acting \u201clike everything is wonderful.\u201d \u201cI watched last night, and it was like all beautiful roses,\u201d he said. \u201cEverybody knows she is smart,\u201d Biden said. \u201cEverybody knows she is tough. But I know what she is passionate about. I know Hillary. Hillary understands. Hillary gets it.\u201d Former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, meanwhile, said he was not a Democrat or a Republican but appeared at the convention to demolish his fellow billionaire\u2019s reputation in business. Michael Bloomberg endorses Clinton, calls Trump a \u2018dangerous demagogue\u2019 \u201cI believe we need a president who is a problem-solver, not a bomb-thrower,\u201d said Bloomberg. He quipped that unlike Trump, he didn\u2019t start his business empire with a \u201cmillion dollar check from my father.\u201d \u201cTrump has left behind a well-documented record of bankruptcies, thousands of lawsuits, angry shareholders and contractors who feel cheated, and disillusioned customers who feel ripped off,\u201d Bloomberg said. \u201cTrump says he wants to run the nation like he\u2019s run his business. God help us!\u201d \u201cI am a New Yorker, and I know a con when I see one.\u201d He went on: \u201cThe bottom line is: Trump is a risky, reckless, and radical choice. And we can\u2019t afford to make that choice!\u201d The night of the DNC also offered a big opportunity for Tim Kaine, Clinton\u2019s vice presidential pick, who introduced himself to an audience unfamiliar with his years as a governor and senator in Virginia. He affected an impression of Trump and used the billionaire\u2019s verbal tick \u201cBelieve Me\u201d to ridicule him as a \u201cslick talking, empty promising, self promoting, one man wrecking crew.\u201d Noting that his son, Nat, deployed with the US Marines this week, Kaine quickly slammed Trump for raising the possibility that his administration wouldn\u2019t always defend NATO allies. Kaine said his son would \u201cprotect and defend the very NATO allies that Donald Trump now says he wants to abandon.\u201d He made a case that Americans should trust Clinton. \u201cI trust Hillary Clinton with our son\u2019s life,\u201d Kaine said. \u201cYou know who I don\u2019t trust? Donald Trump.\u201d \u201cYou cannot believe one word that comes out of Donald Trump\u2019s mouth. Not one word,\u201d Kaine said, slamming the GOP nominee as a \u201cslick talking, empty promising, self promoting, one man wrecking crew.\u201d The night\u2019s underlying theme was security \u2014 national security, economic security and safety from gun crime. Leon Panetta, the former CIA director and secretary of defense, lashed out at Trump over his apparent call on Russian intelligence agencies to help find emails that Hillary Clinton deleted from her private server. \u201cToday, Donald Trump today once again took Russia\u2019s side. He asked the Russians to interfere in American politics. Think about that  for a moment. Donald Trump, who wants to be president of the United States, is asking one of our adversaries to engage in hacking or intelligence efforts against the United States of America to affect an election,\u201d Panetta said. \u201cAs someone who was responsible for protecting our nation from cyberattacks, it\u2019s inconceivable to me that any presidential candidate would be that irresponsible,\u201d he said.  \u201cDonald Trump cannot become our commander-in-chief.\u201d Democrats accuse Trump of disloyalty over Clinton emails During his remarks, some Bernie Sanders supporters began to chant \u201cNo More War!\u201d but were drowned out by counter chants of \u201cUSA, USA.\u201d Soon after Panetta spoke, the Trump campaign released a statement criticizing the former defense secretary\u2019s stance. \u201cIt is alarming that Leon Panetta would, through his silence, excuse Hillary Clinton\u2019s enablement of foreign espionage with her illegal email scheme and her corrupt decision to then destroy those emails and dissemble her \u2018private\u2019 server to hide her crimes from the public and authorities,\u201d Trump senior policy adviser Stephen Miller said. He also argued that it was Clinton who is endangering national security with her policies in the Middle East and North Africa. The FBI recommended not to bring criminal charges against Clinton earlier this month related to her private email server. But the night will likely be most remembered for the power of Obama\u2019s rhetoric. He appeared deeply emotional as he began to take his leave of the nation he has led. \u201cFor all the tough lessons I\u2019ve had to learn; for all the places I\u2019ve fallen short; I\u2019ve told Hillary, and I\u2019ll tell you what\u2019s picked me back up, every single time,\u201d Obama said. \u201cIt\u2019s been you. The American people.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Michelle Obama addressed the DNC Monday night The first lady is a powerful surrogate to Clinton Michelle Obama cast the presidential race as one between a positive role model for children \u2013 in Hillary Clinton \u2013 and a damaging one \u2013 in Donald Trump \u2013 in the marquee speech on the Democratic National Convention\u2019s opening night. The first lady never mentioned Trump by name, but leveraging her popularity, she made a rare, if not unprecedented, foray into partisan politics to knock the Republican nominee. Obama condemned \u201cthe hateful language that we hear from public figures on TV,\u201d saying that \u201cour motto is, when they go low, we go high.\u201d And in a shot at Trump\u2019s \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d campaign slogan, Obama discussed raising her children in a White House that was built by slaves. Memorable lines from the DNC\u2019s opening night \u201cDon\u2019t let anyone tell you that this country isn\u2019t great. This right now is the greatest country on earth,\u201d the first lady said. Obama electrified the crowd at the Wells Fargo Arena in Philadelphia, taking the stage just after 10 p.m. ET and \u2013 in a departure from the political attacks on display all day \u2013 making the case that, because of her character and temperament, Clinton is the role model she\u2019d like her daughters to see in the Oval Office. Even Trump, who Obama was implicitly criticizing, praised her remarks. \u201cI thought her delivery was excellent,\u201d Trump told The Hollywood Reporter. \u201cI thought she did a very good job. I liked her speech.\u201d It was a remarkable embrace of the prime-time stage for Obama, who was reluctant about the spotlight that came when her husband, then-Illinois Sen. Barack Obama, launched his presidential campaign against Clinton in 2007. \u201cTo understand the journey she\u2019s taken as a reluctant conscript on the public scene, to come here and command that stage the way she did tonight was extraordinary \u2013 and I think did for Hillary Clinton what no one else has done to this point,\u201d said David Axelrod, a top Obama strategist on the 2008 campaign and now a CNN political commentator. Symone Sanders, former national press secretary for the Bernie Sanders campaign, praised Obama\u2019s speech for its historical significance. \u201cThe Obamas were the first African-American First Family that we had and they did not eradicate racism in this country. We do not live in this post-racial society, where race doesn\u2019t matter, where the struggle is not there for people of color in this country,\u201d she told CNN\u2019s Chris Cuomo Tuesday on \u201cNew Day.\u201d \u201cAnd I think Michelle Obama went up on that stage and embodied everything that is great about America,\u201d Sanders added. \u201cShe gave us hope but she also told us we still have work to do.\u201d New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, who spoke before Obama, praised her speech for its \u201cspirit.\u201d \u201cShe spoke from the heart. You felt her energy. You felt her spirit,\u201d he said Tuesday on \u201cNew Day.\u201d Transcript: Michelle Obama's DNC speech \u201cI think that what people expected was a speech but what they really got was a sharing, a convening of spirit. And when she talked about her kids, that really affected me.\u201d Dems open convention without Wasserman Schultz The first lady began discussing watching her daughters grow up in the White House \u2013 saying she remembers watching them go off to school for the first time. \u201cAt that moment, I realized that our time in the White House would form the foundation for who they would become, and how we managed this experience could truly make or break them,\u201d she said. She added: \u201cThis election \u2013 every election \u2013 is about who will have the power to shape our children for the next four or eight years of our lives. And I am here tonight because in this election, there is only one person who I trust with that responsibility \u2013 only one person who I believe is truly qualified to be President of the United States. And that is our friend, Hillary Clinton.\u201d Obama told the electrified audience that \u201cwe are always stronger together,\u201d saying she wants a president \u201cwho will teach our children that everyone in this country matters.\u201d \u201cI am here tonight because I know that that is the kind of president that Hillary Clinton will be, and that\u2019s why in this election, I\u2019m with her,\u201d Obama said. Who to watch in DNC prime time Michelle Obama hits back against \u2018hateful\u2019 rhetoric In a nod to Clinton\u2019s historic status as the first female presumptive nominee of a major U.S. political party, she said: \u201cBecause of Hillary Clinton, my daughters, and all our sons and daughters, now take for granted that a woman can be president of the United States.\u201d She called Clinton \u201ca leader who will be guided every day by the love and hope and impossibly big dreams that we all have for our children.\u201d Temperament and experience is something Michelle Obama has been referencing a lot these days \u2013 dipping her toe into 2016 politics by taking veiled shots at Donald Trump in speeches over the past few months. \u201cRight now, when we\u2019re hearing so much disturbing and hateful rhetoric, it is so important to remember that our diversity has been \u2013 and will always be \u2013 our greatest source of strength and pride here in the United States,\u201d Mrs. Obama said at a Nowruz celebration at the White House in April. \u201cHere in America, we don\u2019t give in to our fears.  We don\u2019t build up walls to keep people out,\u201d she said during a commencement address at City College of New York this June. Michelle Obama is seen as having a unique and essential role to play for Clinton, key to keeping the Obama coalition of women, African Americans, Hispanics and young people engaged. \u200eThe first lady could turn into a powerful surrogate to boost the presumptive Democratic nominee, with her high favorability ratings. \u201cI think Hillary Clinton is a phenomenal woman,\u201d the first lady said when asked about her at a White House event in April, \u201cand I\u2019ve gotten to know her, and I think she\u2019s made some pretty major contributions over the course of her life.\u201d However, she took the stage to make the case for a woman she hasn\u2019t always supported. During the bruising 2008 Democratic primary fight, Michelle Obama often took veiled swipes at her husband\u2019s opponent. \u201cThey said there was an inevitable candidate, that there was someone who was going to make this race virtually impossible. And I thought, wow, it\u2019s over already?\u201d Obama said in an interview with CBS in the fall of 2007, in the throes of the Democratic primary. \u201cSo, our view is that if you can\u2019t run your own house, you certainly can\u2019t run the White House,\u201d Michelle Obama said from the campaign trail in the early state of Iowa in August of 2007. Michelle Obama: I wake up in a house built by slaves But theirs was a relationship that grew once the campaign came to a close. Shortly after Hillary Clinton suspended her campaign and endorsed then-Sen. Barack Obama, Michelle praised Clinton for the way she came around to supporting her husband. \u201cFrom the minute after this was done, right, she has always been just cordial and open. I\u2019ve called her. I\u2019ve talked to her. She\u2019s given me advice about the kids,\u201d Obama told Larry King in October of 2008, \u201cWe\u2019ve talked at length about this kind of stuff, how you feel, how you react. She has been amazing. She is a real pro and a woman with character.\u201d The convention stage is a platform that Obama is familiar with by now, delivering high-profile speeches in both the 2008 and 2012 conventions for her husband, speeches that drew heavily on the Obama family\u2019s personal story. \u201cEvery step of the way since that clear day, February, 19 months ago, when, with little more than our faith in each other and a hunger for change, we joined my husband, Barack Obama, on the improbable journey that has led us to this moment,\u201d Mrs. Obama said in Denver at the DNC in 2008. \u201cBut each of us comes here also by way of our own improbable journey.\u201d She hit similar themes, weaving in their personal narrative, four years later. \u201cBarack knows the American Dream because he\u2019s lived it and he wants everyone in this country to have that same opportunity, no matter who we are, or where we\u2019re from, or what we look like, or who we love,\u201d she said in 2012 in Charlotte. CNN\u2019s Eugene Scott contributed to this story.",

            "article_content": "Reporters, researchers and editors across CNN listened to the speeches CNN rated key statements as either true; mostly true; true, but misleading; false; or it's complicated The Republican Party gathered in Cleveland on Wednesday for the third night of its convention, and CNN\u2019s Reality Check Team put the speakers\u2019 statements and assertions to the test. The team of reporters, researchers and editors across CNN listened throughout the speeches and selected key statements, rating them true; mostly true; true, but misleading; false; or it\u2019s complicated. Reality Check: Pence on Obama\u2019s \u2018relentless mandates\u2019 By Chip Grabow, CNN Pence criticized the Obama administration\u2019s use of executive orders. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen relentless mandates from the executive branch. It seems no aspect of our lives is too small for the present administration to supervise, no provision of the Constitution too large for them to ignore,\u201d Pence said. While Pence\u2019s meaning of the word \u201crelentless\u201d is open to interpretation, the implication was clear: President Barack Obama has issued an excessive number of executive orders. So what is Obama\u2019s record of executive orders issued, and how does it compare with his modern-day predecessors? According to the National Archives Federal Register, as of July 7, during his two terms, Obama has issued 244 executive orders. President George W. Bush: 291 executive orders. President Bill Clinton: 364 executive orders. President George H.W. Bush: 166 executive orders. President Ronald Reagan: 381 executive orders. President Jimmy Carter: 320 executive orders. And President Gerald Ford: 169 executive orders. Taking the average of all those orders, the number is 276. At 244 orders, Obama could be said to have issued fewer orders than average among his cohorts of the past 40 years. Pence\u2019s characterization of that number as \u201crelentless\u201d is in the eye of the beholder, but his implication is that Obama has issued an excessive number of orders. Because the actual count of executive orders issued by Obama is not out of line with those issued by modern day presidents, we rate Pence\u2019s claim to be false. It\u2019s also worth noting Newt Gingrich on Tuesday evening told an audience at The Union Club in Cleveland that he would urge Trump, on his first day in office, to issue as many as 300 executive orders. By the way, during his 12 years in office, President Franklin D. Roosevelt issued 3,728 executive orders. Reality Check: Pence says Clinton \u2018all but invented\u2019 Obamacare By Sonam Vashi, CNN \u201cHillary Clinton essentially offers a third Obama term,\u201d Pence said. \u201cAnd the role is perfect for her. She championed Obamacare because, years earlier, she had all but invented it.\u201d It\u2019s a line that Clinton has promoted herself in recent months \u2013 that \u201cit was called Hillarycare before it was called Obamacare,\u201d referring to the 1993 health care reform effort that she led. But how closely tied are the two programs? While Clinton\u2019s plan laid the groundwork for 2010\u2019s Affordable Care Act, many experts say the real precursor to Obamacare is \u201cRomneycare,\u201d the 2006 health insurance reform laws implemented in Massachusetts by the former Republican presidential candidate. Clinton\u2019s plan was \u201cmore ambitious in its scope\u201d than the Affordable Care Act, according to Bloomberg, \u201cmore comprehensive\u201d because it included more parts of the industry, according to Forbes, and it sought to achieve universal health coverage. Republicans proposed an alternative for Clinton\u2019s plan in 1993. Their bill was called Health Equity and Access Reform Today (HEART) and included, among other things, an individual mandate to buy insurance \u2013 which would later become the centerpiece of Obama\u2019s 2010 plan. (To add further irony, Obama would argue against an individual mandate in the 2008 Democratic primary, against Clinton). While Hillarycare may have served as the ultimate inspiration for Obamacare, it\u2019s inaccurate to say that she \u201call but invented\u201d it when the Affordable Care Act more closely resembles Romneycare\u2019s scope and structure. The claims of Pence (and Clinton) are false. Reality Check: Gingrich on administration lying about Iran nuclear deals By Ryan Browne, CNN National Security Producer Gingrich lambasted the Obama administration\u2019s handling of the Iran nuclear deal negotiations, accusing the administration of lying about the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Agreement, the accord\u2019s official name. \u201cWe know this administration and its allies lied to us about the Iran nuclear deal. We know it because they openly bragged about it to The New York Times,\u201d Gingrich said Wednesday night. Gingrich is likely referring to the idea that the White House misled the American people over the timing of the Iran nuclear deal. According to a lengthy interview and profile in The New York Times Magazine, White House Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes said that the administration had misrepresented when the deal had begun to be negotiated as part of an effort to create a narrative that tied the start of negotiations to the 2013 election of Iranian moderate Hassan Rouhani to the presidency. Rhodes provides the story\u2019s author with a detailed walk-through of the efforts to sell the deal to the American public. The article described the narrative as \u201cactively misleading, because the most meaningful part of the negotiations with Iran had begun in mid-2012, many months before Rouhani and the \u201cmoderate\u201d camp were chosen in an election.\u201d When then-State Department spokeswoman Victoria Nuland was asked if such negotiations were taking place in 2012, she denied the secret nuclear talks between the United States and Iran. After it was revealed in December 2013 that secret talks between the United States and Iran actually had taken place, then-spokeswoman Jen Psaki admitted the administration lied in order to protect the secret negotiations. Rhodes took issue with the characterization in the Times article, saying in a post on Medium that \u201cWe never made any secret of our interest in pursuing a nuclear deal with Iran.\u201d While he acknowledged that negotiations had indeed begun in 2012, he added that \u201cwe did not have any serious prospect of reaching a nuclear deal until after the election of Hasan Rouhani in 2013.\u201d The New York Times did not issue a retraction. Because the administration did not initially acknowledge that negotiations had begun prior to 2013, even going as far as to deny their existence in 2012, and because Rhodes detailed the selling strategy to The New York Times, Gingrich\u2019s claim that the administration lied about the negotiations is accurate. Therefore, we rate this claim to be true. Reality Check: Cruz on the Republican Party passing the Civil Rights Act By Sonam Vashi, CNN Cruz extolled the values and history of the Republican Party, saying, \u201cTogether, we passed the Civil Rights Act, and together, we fought to eliminate Jim Crow laws.\u201d The Civil Rights Act of 1964 barred segregation and racial discrimination in public places. The act passed the House by a vote of 289 to 126, with 153 Democrats (or 60%) voting yea, compared with 136 (or 76%) of Republicans. In the Senate, 69% of Democrats voted yea, versus 82% of Republicans. Part of the reason for these percentages was that socially conservative Southern Democrats formed the bulk of opposition to the bill. The Party of Lincoln had higher percentages of its members voting for the Civil Rights Act in both houses of Congress, and the same is true for the Voting Rights Act of 1965, the \u201ccrown jewel\u201d of the Civil Rights movement that prohibited racial discrimination in voting, ending Jim Crow laws such as literacy tests and poll taxes. Cruz\u2019s claim here is true. Reality Check: Cruz on Iranian holidays By Lisa Rose, CNN Cruz also railed against the nuclear deal with Iran, claiming that the country expresses its hostility toward the West with two \u201cholidays\u201d: \u201cDeath to America Day\u201d and \u201cDeath to Israel Day.\u201d Cruz\u2019s claims are rooted in annual protests where participants have historically engaged in inflammatory rhetoric and flag burning. The day of protest against America is on November 4, the anniversary of the siege on the American embassy in Tehran, when 52 hostages were taken by student revolutionaries in 1979. In Iran, the last Friday of Ramadan doubles as al-Quds Day, or Jerusalem Day, a day of demonstrations for Palestinian independence. Iran continues to refuse to recognize Israel as a legitimate country and President Hassan Rouhani has stirred up controversy by defending the \u201cDeath to America\u201d mantra as a criticism of policy rather than a violent call to action. Cruz goes too far by suggesting the country has two state-sanctioned days of hatred and intolerance. Neither is an official holiday, according to the Iranian consulate. Verdict: False. Reality Check: Eric Trump on his father\u2019s refurbishing of Wollman Park skating rink By Julie Block, CNN Donald Trump\u2019s son, Eric, said in his speech that his father invested $2 million of his own money into the refurbishing of an ice skating rink in Central Park because he was \u201cdisgusted by government incompetence\u201d when the project \u201cdragged on for over six years and ballooned to over $13 million \u2013 $5 million over an already inflated budget.\u201d The younger Trump went on to say that, with his father\u2019s investment, the project was completed less than six months later \u2013 two months ahead of schedule and more than $1 million under budget. The New York Times reported in June 1986 that the 1980 Wollman Memorial Rink project was originally supposed to span two years and cost $9.1 million \u2013 a budget that included the landscaping and building a restaurant \u2013 but planning and design errors caused repeated delays. The city instead spent six years and $12 million \u2013 not \u201cover $13 million,\u201d as Eric Trump claimed \u2013 trying to rehabilitate the Central Park skating rink. The $12 million spent on the project was more than $3 million over budget, certainly a substantial sum, though not the \u201c$5 million\u201d Trump spoke of. The city ran into problems with new technology it had bought for making ice. After spending $200,000 figuring out what went wrong, city officials said the problems were irreparable and they would have to start the project over. Then Trump stepped in. He originally offered to rebuild the rink on his own dime on the condition that he could operate it and the adjacent restaurant and use the profits to replenish the money he was to spend on the project. In negotiations with the then-New York City Mayor Ed Koch, the city agreed to foot the bill in exchange for Trump dropping his demand to operate the rink and restaurant. So, while Trump took over the project, Eric\u2019s claim that his father \u201cinvested $2 million of his own money\u201d is false. Another New York Times piece, published in November 1986, shortly after the rink\u2019s grand opening, reported that Trump refurbished the rink 2\u00bd months ahead of his original six-month schedule and $750,000 below his projected $3 million budget \u2013 not quite \u201cover $1 million under budget,\u201d as Eric Trump said. The Times reported that Trump was able to complete the project so quickly because he did not have to follow the \u201cmany rules and competitive bidding provisions that govern city construction.\u201d Although some of Eric\u2019s numbers on the city\u2019s spending and his father\u2019s budget savings are a bit inflated, Trump did take over the project and complete it under budget and in a timely manner. Because of this, CNN found these claims to be mostly true. Reality Check: Eric Trump on national debt By Tami Luhby, CNNMoney Trump will implement a common sense business approach to solve the nation\u2019s woes, his son Eric said. \u201cWho better to apply practical solutions to the impractical decision-making of an administration that has bred a $19 trillion debt? \u2013 one which goes up by $32,000 a second and over $2 billion a day,\u201d Eric Trump said. It\u2019s true that the national debt is $19 trillion \u2013 $19.4 trillion to be exact \u2013 as of June. But the Obama administration didn\u2019t breed all that. The national debt was $10.6 trillion in January 2009, when former President George W. Bush left office. As for how quickly it\u2019s growing, that fluctuates from year to year. In June 2015, the national debt was $18.1 trillion. So it grew $1.3 trillion over the past year. Because of that fluctuation, it\u2019s hard to say exactly how much it grows per day or per second. The Congressional Budget Office projects that the budget deficit for 2016 will be $544 billion. Add to that a few hundred billion in intragovernmental borrowing. That\u2019s close enough to rate Eric Trump\u2019s estimate of $32,000 a second, or $2 billion a day, as true. Reality Check: Eric Trump on $150 billion to Iran By Eve Bower, CNN Trump\u2019s middle son rehashed one of his father\u2019s favorite lines throughout his campaign: that the Obama administration agreed to give $150 billion to Iran as part of the terms of the 2015 nuclear agreement, formally known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. The line remains false. In 2011 and 2012, the United States and Europe imposed sanctions on Iran that included freezing some Iranian assets overseas. With the announcement of a nuclear deal in 2015, those same assets stood to be released \u2013 if the terms of the deal were upheld \u2013 creating a pool of money that would become available to the Iranian government for the first time in years. The total amount of those assets is not known, but as a deal with Iran seemed imminent, some estimated  the number was as high as $150 billion. In July 2015, at a Senate Foreign Relations Committee hearing on the deal, then-House Speaker John Boehner and others claimed that \u201cmore than $100 billion\u201d in unfrozen assets would be available to Iran. But two entities with direct knowledge of the assets involved, the Treasury Department and the White House, have disputed these estimates. In Treasury Secretary Jacob Lew\u2019s July 2015 testimony to the Senate, he estimated that, after sanctions relief, Iran will only be able to access \u201cabout $50 billion\u201d in unfrozen assets. He said that \u201ctens of billions\u201d of these assets comprise nonperforming loans to Iranian energy and banking interests. In a detailed statement on the deal, the White House later called the $150 billion estimate \u201centirely off base.\u201d So just over one year into the agreement, how much of these assets has Iran received? It depends whom you ask. In February, less than one month after the United Nations certified that Iran had met its obligations up to that point and sanctions could be lifted, Iran\u2019s government spokesman, Mohammad Bagher Nobakht, said that Iran had gained access to more than $100 billion in previously frozen assets. But Iran\u2019s own Central Bank says the amount will be less than one-third that. Economists say the true figure is difficult to estimate because there are different types of assets, and some will not be recovered immediately. Because no party with direct access to the assets has given a public estimate anywhere close to the figure Trump suggests, this assertion is deemed false. Reality Check: Eileen Collins on space shuttle retirement By Lisa Rose, CNN Retired astronaut Eileen Collins noted that Wednesday was the anniversary of the moon landing in 1969 and lamented the end of the space shuttle program in 2011. \u201cIn 2011, the space shuttle program ended,\u201d Collins said. \u201cThe last time the United States launched our own astronauts from our own soil was over five years ago. We must do better than that.\u201d Collins suggested that Obama lacks the lofty vision and initiative of his predecessors. Collins failed to note, however, that the sunset of the space shuttle program was set in motion by former President George W. Bush. During a 2004 speech on the future of NASA, Bush announced the shuttles would be retired after they flew several final trips to complete work on the International Space Station. At the time, Bush reassured Americans NASA would continue to pursue manned space travel, saying the agency was developing a new orbiter to replace the shuttle, with a moon trip planned for 2020. Fact-checking Day 2 of GOP convention speeches In 2006, the government slashed $3 billion from NASA\u2019s budget, the first in a series of cuts that have indefinitely delayed the moon voyage. During Obama\u2019s first campaign for president, he expressed confidence that despite NASA\u2019s money woes, a moon landing was still on the horizon. He canceled the moon mission, however, in 2010, explaining that it would be more cost effective to concentrate on robotic exploration and support private companies like SpaceX by hiring them as contractors. Collins neglected to mention the successes of commercial aerospace companies; SpaceX has launched and landed two reusable rockets in the past year. It\u2019s ironic for her to bemoan NASA\u2019s downsizing given the Republican Party\u2019s preference for private sector innovation over taxpayer-funded endeavors. She also failed to acknowledge recent milestones like fellow astronaut Scott Kelly\u2019s record-setting year in orbit aboard the ISS. While Obama was in office when the space shuttle program ended, George W. Bush chose to retire the orbiters. For this reason, we rate Collins\u2019 claim true, but misleading. Collins ended her speech by declaring that Trump will help America recapture the pioneering spirit of the Apollo era, even though the candidate has said that fixing potholes is more important than exploring the cosmos. Reality Check: Harold Hamm on energy imports funding terror By Ryan Browne, CNN National Security Producer Hamm, who helped pioneer the shale industry, slammed Obama\u2019s energy policies Wednesday night, saying that restrictions on domestic oil and gas drilling was helping to fund terrorism. \u201cEvery time we can\u2019t drill a well in America, terrorism is being funded. Orlando brought this home once again. \u2026 It\u2019s been 15 years since 9/11. We can\u2019t ignore this any longer,\u201d Hamm said. CNN fact checks RNC's Hillary Clinton email allegations While the shale revolution increased U.S. domestic energy production considerably, the United States still imports a significant amount of oil from foreign countries. By far the biggest supplier of oil, both crude and petroleum, to the United States is Canada, which supplied 40% of American oil imports in 2015, according to the U.S. Department of Energy. Other major suppliers include Saudi Arabia, Venezuela, Colombia, Mexico, Iraq, Ecuador, Kuwait, Brazil and Chad. None of these countries is designated state sponsors of terrorism by the U.S. State Department. The United States buys no oil from those three countries: Iran, Syria and Sudan. Canada, Iraq, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia are all members of the counter ISIS coalition, helping to combat that terrorist group, while Chad\u2019s military works with the United States to fight the al Qaeda-affiliated terror group Boko Haram. Venezuela, Colombia, Mexico, Ecuador and Brazil have never been accused of engaging in terrorism. Therefore we rate the claim that restrictions on domestic oil and gas help \u201cto fund terrorism\u201d false. Reality Check: Hamm on U.S. energy independence By Sonam Vashi, CNN Hamm praised Trump\u2019s energy agenda. \u201cPresident Trump will fuel America\u2019s future and become the first president to achieve American energy independence. President Obama chose not to get it, and he has tried to destroy this renaissance and all of its benefits.\u201d He went on to add, \u201cAmerica has two distinct choices. Our nation should embrace energy independence, not eliminate it. Hillary Clinton would eliminate fossil fuel development in America, she would kill jobs, drive up gasoline prices, and increase oil imports from our enemies. President Trump will release America\u2019s pent-up energy potential, get rid of foreign oil, trash punitive regulations, create millions of jobs and develop our most strategic geopolitical weapon: crude oil.\u201d Last year, the U.S. Energy Information Administration predicted the United States would hit energy independence, or a critical reduction in imports of foreign oil and gas, in 2028 if oil prices continue a modest and slow rise. The United States has been the world\u2019s top oil producer since 2014. Between 2008 and 2015, American oil production increased by 88%, the fastest increase in history. However, the United States is still largely reliant on foreign sources of oil, importing almost 10 million barrels per day. For context, the United States consumes about 19.4 million barrels per day. It\u2019s hard to imagine that a Trump presidency could realistically wipe out all oil imports, even by 2024. CNN fact checks RNC's Hillary Clinton email allegations Oil production has slowed recently with the crash in oil prices, caused in part by excess supply in the United States and elsewhere. A number of factors influence oil production, including prices and technology, and it\u2019s difficult to predict the exact effects that certain policies have on oil production and prices. For example, as the United States removed its 40-year-old ban on crude oil exports this year, the EIA estimated that U.S. gas prices would be unchanged or only slightly reduced. Obama\u2019s policies have neither encouraged nor discouraged oil production, according to experts. His administration has put some restrictions on fracking, but it has largely not blocked the growth of the technology \u2013 off which Hamm has made much of his fortune. We rate Hamm\u2019s claim that Obama \u201cchose not to get\u201d energy independence as false, because Obama presided over the largest oil boom in U.S. history, even as there are various causes for that boom. It\u2019s also false to say Clinton wants to \u201celiminate fossil fuel development in America.\u201d While she has proposed cutting tax subsidies for oil and gas companies and reducing the amount of oil consumed in the United States, she has also proposed switching from coal to natural gas (another fossil fuel), not eliminating development of fossil fuels altogether. Reality Check: Obamacare\u2019s effect on small businesses By Tami Luhby, CNNMoney Michelle Van Etten, a senior vice chairman marketing director for Youngevity, is representing small-business owners at the GOP convention. She hit on Democrats for taking actions she said were unfriendly to entrepreneurs. She said the country needs a president \u201cwho will repeal Obamacare and allow small businesses to be able to provide health care for their employees again.\u201d Even before Obamacare was passed, not that many small businesses offered health insurance. In 2009, 57% of businesses with three to 49 employees offered coverage, while 98% of firms employing at least 100 workers did, according to the 2015 Kaiser/HRET survey of employer-sponsored health benefits. Those figures haven\u2019t changed much. In 2015, 54% of the smallest businesses provided health insurance and 97% of large companies did. Obamacare created the Small Business Health Options Program, known as SHOP, to encourage businesses with fewer than 50 workers to provide coverage. But very few companies and employees signed up, in part because the premiums were pricey and because small firms aren\u2019t required to offer insurance. Looking at midsize businesses, with 50 to 99 employees, some 89% offered coverage in 2015, down slightly from 92% in 2009. These firms aren\u2019t required to offer insurance until next year. Small businesses are not now required to offer health insurance and they didn\u2019t universally do so prior to Obamacare. Because of this, we rate Van Etten\u2019s statement as false.",

The author works at the institute. If presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton wins in November, Senate Republicans should move immediately to confirm D.C. Circuit Chief Judge Merrick Garland, President Barack Obama\u2019s choice for the Supreme Court, according to a prominent conservative radio broadcaster. Hugh Hewitt, who had been a leader in the movement to block Garland\u2019s nomination, said he believes the veteran judge and former prosecutor would be a more palatable choice than any Clinton might make. Nightcap: The latest news and political buzz from CNN Politics | Sign up \u201cIt would be my hope that they would move immediately to confirm Judge Garland because (while) he is a liberal judge, he is not to the far left of the ideological spectrum,\u201d Hewitt, columnist and host of \u201cThe Hugh Hewitt Show,\u201d told David Axelrod on \u201cThe Axe Files\u201d podcast, produced by CNN and the University of Chicago Institute of Politics. When asked how the Senate could have a final vote of approval on a nominee who was not subject to the scrutiny of Judiciary Committee hearings, Hewitt said, \u201cBecause you\u2019re the Senate and you don\u2019t have to do anything other than what you want to do. The Senate makes its own rules. So if Mitch McConnell brings it to the floor and they confirm him, he\u2019s on.\u201d Hewitt praised the \u201cexcellent list\u201d of potential Supreme Court picks that presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump released in May. \u201cI don\u2019t think he cares about justices and judges but he knows that it matters a great deal to my wing of the party,\u201d Hewitt added. But Hewitt cast doubt on whether Trump would be in a position to make the choice, rating Clinton a 2-to-1 favorite to win. He said she could further strengthen her bid by naming retired Admiral James G. Stavridis to be her vice presidential nominee. \u201cIf she picks the admiral, the former ambassador to NATO, I think the election may be lost\u201d for Republicans, Hewitt said. This conversation with Hewitt came a few hours after news that three police officers were killed in Baton Rouge, Louisiana, which prompted Trump to reiterate, \u201cwe demand law and order.\u201d Asked whether he saw intentional intimations of the racially-tinged \u201claw and order\u201d rhetoric used by Hewitt\u2019s former boss and mentor President Richard Nixon, he replied, \u201cThere are, and I wonder who is actually helping \u2013 if they\u2019ve tested that. I asked a Trump campaign operative today if they\u2019re testing that, because in \u201968 it meant a racial connotation. This time it means, \u2018I\u2019m with the police,\u2019 and that is a very powerful message that a lot of people.\u201d To hear the whole conversation with Hewitt, which also touched on Hewitt\u2019s time as a young researcher to Nixon, how Hewitt went from describing Trump as a \u201cstage-IV cancer\u201d to supporting his candidacy, his own Zelig-like knack for crossing paths with prominent figures in American politics, and much more, click on http://podcast.cnn.com.

            "article_content": "Hillary Clinton has an advantage over Donald Trump among young voters, according to new pols But two surveys suggest that many young voters are inclined to choose someone other than the two major party candidates Hillary Clinton tops Donald Trump in two new polls of younger voters, but both surveys suggest that many young voters are inclined to choose someone other than the two major party candidates or to stay home entirely on election day. Dissatisfaction with politics and with the choices on this year\u2019s ballot are widespread among millennial voters. That could be troubling news for Clinton\u2019s campaign, despite her overall lead in the group. That voters under age 30 tend to lean Democratic isn\u2019t a shock \u2013 the group hasn\u2019t backed a Republican for president since 1988, according to network exit polls \u2013 but their turnout and strength of support for the Democrat can sway the outcome. Neither poll suggests Clinton holds the backing of a majority of younger voters. The Harvard IOP poll finds Clinton topping Trump by a 45%-to-23% margin among those most likely to vote in the fall, with 13% behind Libertarian candidate Gary Johnson and another 19% unsure who they\u2019d support. And the GenForward Survey, which interviewed the broader group of adults age 30 and younger and did not include Johnson in the list of candidates, found Clinton ahead by a similar margin, holding 38% to Trump\u2019s 17%, with 22% backing someone else, 7% undecided and 16% saying they probably wouldn\u2019t vote at all. In almost every election since 1988, younger voters have favored the Democrat over the Republican by a margin of 9 points or more. The exception was 2000, when Democrats\u2019 advantage among younger voters shrank, with Al Gore narrowly topping George W. Bush among voters under 30 by just 2 points. Younger voters were a key component of Barack Obama\u2019s winning coalition in 2008, and while they generally broke in Obama\u2019s favor again in 2012, Obama lost ground among younger whites, dampening his margin among the under-30 voter set. The GenForward study, from the Black Youth Project at the University of Chicago with the AP-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research, drilled down into racial and ethnic divisions among younger voters, finding Trump\u2019s support among black, Asian and Hispanic youth in the single digits, while he carries about a quarter of younger white voters. Black and Hispanic youth who back Clinton are far more likely to describe their vote as one of support for the former Secretary of State, while white and Asian young adults who favor her mostly say they are expressing opposition to Trump. The Harvard IOP Poll echoes that sentiment, with just 21% of Clinton\u2019s backers saying they\u2019re very enthusiastic about supporting her, while 36% of Trump\u2019s backers say the same. In both polls, majorities express unfavorable views of Clinton and Trump, but the GenForward study suggests they have more faith in Clinton\u2019s qualifications for president \u2013 55% see Clinton as qualified compared with just 21% who say Trump is. This week also featured a survey sponsored by Fusion which asked those age 35 or younger to describe a Trump presidency in one word, and found far more negative responses than positive ones: 70% used a negative word or phrase, with variations on \u201cscary,\u201d \u201chorror\u201d and \u201cterrified\u201d topping the list. Perceptions of both Trump and Clinton pale in comparison among young voters to those of a candidate who is no longer in the race: Bernie Sanders. More than 7 in 10 in the GenForward study call him qualified, and if he had been the Democrat on the ticket in November, more than 6 in 10 say they would\u2019ve voted for him over Trump. In the Harvard IOP survey, 54% expressed favorable views of the senator from Vermont. Given their current choices, however, 7 in 10 young adults say they would like for a third-party candidate to run, according to the GenForward survey, while just 3 in 10 say they are satisfied with the choice of Clinton or Trump. That dissatisfaction extends to the political system generally. A third or more in both polls thought the political system needed major work, with 36% in the GenForward poll saying \u201cthe two-party system is seriously broken\u201d and 33% in the Harvard IOP survey saying politics needed \u201cto find a reset button and start again.\u201d Few major polls have extensive samples of younger voters, as they are typically harder to reach by telephone than older Americans. Two of these polls were conducted online, using panels that were recruited by traditional mail or telephone surveys, one was conducted by phone. The GenForward Survey was conducted online June 14-27 among 1,965 adults age 18-30. Results have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.8 percentage points. The Harvard Institute of Politics Poll was conducted online June 21-July 3 among 1,001 18-29 year olds, and has an error margin of plus or minus 3.5 percentage points. The Fusion Poll was conducted by telephone by Langer Research Associates June 1-14 among 983 adults age 18 to 35.",

            "article_content": "Trump's 2-point edge over Clinton is within the poll's 4.9 point error margin Clinton is winning with voters aged 50 and older but Trump is leading with younger voters Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are virtually tied in Iowa, a new poll finds. Trump has the support of 44% of Iowa voters while Clinton received 42%, according to a Monmouth University poll released Tuesday. His 2-point edge is well within the survey\u2019s 4.9-point margin of error. \u201cIt\u2019s a toss-up right now, but Iowa could be the leading edge of a Midwest push for Trump,\u201d said Patrick Murray, director of the Monmouth University Polling Institute. Among other Iowa voters likely to participate in the presidential election, 6% plan to vote for Libertarian Party nominee Gary Johnson while 1% say they will back Green Party candidate Jill Stein. Another 2% plan to vote for another candidate while 6% are undecided. Notably, Trump is beating Clinton with voters younger than 50, 51% to 32%, while Clinton is winning with Iowa voters aged 50 and older, 50% to 38%. That result differs from the findings of other recent surveys nationally and in battleground states. While it may be the result of sampling error, the difference could also be a reflection of Iowa\u2019s relatively small minority population. White voters tend to tilt more Republican than racial minorities, even among younger voters, and the effect of that difference is evident in 2012 exit polls. They showed President Barack Obama carrying 56% of Iowa\u2019s under-30 voters, compared with significantly higher numbers in other, less-white battlegrounds like Nevada (68%), North Carolina (67%), Florida (66%), Ohio (63%) and Virginia (61%). The poll was conducted from July 8 to 11 with a random sample of 401 likely Iowa voters. A live caller interviewed 351 registered voters (200 on a landline and 151 on a cell phone) and a random digit-dial supplement of 50 cell phone interviews. The error attributable to sampling has a maximum margin of plus or minus 4.9 percentage points.",

            "article_content": "\"As painful as this week has been, I firmly believe that America is not as divided as some have suggested,\" Obama said Obama didn't mention any critics by name Frankly acknowledging a \u201ctough week\u201d in the United States after anxious days of shootings and racial tensions, President Barack Obama said Saturday that he did not believe the United States was \u201cas divided as some have suggested.\u201d \u201cThere is sorrow, there is anger, there is confusion about next steps,\u201d Obama said during a news conference in Poland. \u201cBut there\u2019s unity in recognizing that this is not how we want our communities to operate. This is not who we want to be as Americans.\u201d Speaking for the third time in Poland about the gun violence that\u2019s seized communities in the United States, Obama said the situation didn\u2019t resemble the periods of mass social unrest in the 1960s. \u201cYou\u2019re not seeing riots, you\u2019re not seeing police going after people who are protesting peacefully,\u201d he said. But he acknowledged a ramped-up anxiety that\u2019s descended on Americans as they watch seemingly unfettered violence on urban streets. \u201cAmericans of all races and all backgrounds are rightly outraged by the inexcusable attacks on police, whether it\u2019s in Dallas or anywhere else,\u201d Obama said. \u201cThat includes protesters, that includes family members who have grave concerns about police misconduct, and they\u2019ve said this is unacceptable. There\u2019s no division there.\u201d Obama didn\u2019t mention any critics by name, but on Friday, presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump said racial divisions in the country have \u201cgotten worse, not better.\u201d The President pushed back on that notion, insisting that Americans of all races were disgusted by gun violence. Obama was speaking at the conclusion of a NATO summit, a meeting whose central themes were largely obscured both by the Dallas shootings and reaction to last month\u2019s Brexit vote. He said the motives of the killer in Dallas were \u201cvery hard to untangle\u201d but called the shooter \u201cdemented\u201d and downplayed the potential political motivations he may have carried. The shooter allegedly voiced a desire to \u201ckill white people\u201d ahead of the attack, authorities have said. \u201cI think the danger is that we somehow suggest that the act of a troubled individual speaks to some larger political statement across the country. It doesn\u2019t,\u201d Obama said. Referencing last year\u2019s attack on churchgoers in Charleston, South Carolina, Obama noted, \u201cWhen some white kid walks into a church and shoots a bunch of worshipers who invite him to worship with them, we don\u2019t assume that somehow he\u2019s making a political statement.\u201d And he made another call for tighter restrictions on guns, saying if Americans are concerned about violence against police officers, \u201cyou can\u2019t set aside the gun issue and pretend that that\u2019s irrelevant.\u201d He voiced frustration at the bitter political debate over guns, lamenting that \u201ceven mention of it somehow evokes this kind of polarization.\u201d \u201cWhen it comes to the issue of gun safety, there is polarization between a very intense minority, and a majority of Americans who actually think that we could be doing better when it comes to gun safety.\u201d Before the NATO sessions even began midday Friday, Obama had delivered two statements about violence back home, as well as addressed continental anxiety about Britain\u2019s decision to leave the European Union. Aides said Obama recognized on his transatlantic flight to Poland that a more robust presidential response was needed in the wake of the killings of African-American men in Minnesota and Louisiana. He made a beeline for a podium in his hotel, arguing that African-Americans are more likely to be pulled over, arrested and shot at by police. But it was only 10 hours later when Obama was back at the podium, this time condemning the sniper attack on police officers in Dallas. Even amid back-to-back meetings with European leaders, Obama pulled away to phone the city\u2019s police chief. Late Friday, after a working dinner had concluded, the White House announced he was scrubbing a planned stop in Seville, Spain, to return home early. He plans to visit Dallas early next week, and called Texas Gov. Greg Abbott from Air Force One on his way to Spain to offer his condolences on behalf of the American people, the White House said. For Obama, it was yet another example of his struggle to balance his symbolic stature as the first African-American president and the realities of a country still struggling with issues of race. \u201cWhat I hope is that my voice has tried to get all of us as Americans to understand the difficult legacy of race,\u201d Obama said of that struggle on Saturday. \u201cTo encourage people to listen to each other. To recognize that, you know, the legacy of slavery and Jim Crow and discrimination didn\u2019t suddenly vanish with the passage of the civil rights act or voting rights act or the election of Barack Obama.\u201d \u201cWe plant seeds,\u201d Obama said of his attempts at promoting racial reconciliation. \u201cAnd somebody else maybe sits under the shade of the tree that we planted.\u201d While the Dallas attack diverted Obama\u2019s attention for at least some of the day, other leaders gathered in Poland were distracted by the still-uncertain future between Britain and the European Union. British Prime Minister David Cameron, seen chatting privately with Obama multiple times over the two-day summit, sought to soothe fears that his decision to allow a referendum on exiting the EU could destabilize the continent. \u201cWhile Britain may be leaving the European Union, we are not withdrawing from the world, nor are we turning our back on Europe or on European security,\u201d Cameron said Saturday. Obama, in a meeting with the presidents of the European Union and the European Council, sought clarity on how the bloc would handle the divorce. Officials said he stressed the importance of finding a solution that could stabilize markets quickly. \u201cI think it was clear that people recognize just how important it is that this be done in a way that not upset financial markets, that not upset global economic stability,\u201d said Ben Rhodes, Obama\u2019s deputy national security adviser. \u201cI think it was clear from the meeting that this is not going to be done in a way that is punitive towards the United Kingdom, but rather is about defining a new relationship.\u201d Like on all of his foreign travel over the past year, Obama came to Poland expecting questions about his country\u2019s rancorous presidential contest. He has said some of the rhetoric emanating from Trump has harmed the United States\u2019 reputation abroad. But more than before, Obama is confronting questions about how the undercurrents of anti-globalism in Trump\u2019s campaign \u2014 the same sentiments that helped propel the \u201cleave\u201d campaign to victory in Britain \u2014 could alter the way the U.S. does business. In Poland, Obama barely mentioned the languishing transatlantic trade deal he hopes to finalize before leaving office, at least in public. In meetings, officials said Obama was intent on pressuring leaders to maintain pressure on Russia amid persistent aggressions in Eastern Europe and to bolster support for the prolonged mission in Afghanistan.",

            "article_content": "NEW: President Barack Obama ordered flags lowered to half-staff on Friday The president expressed condolences to the officers' families of those killed in Dallas President Barack Obama said Friday that the nation was \u201chorrified\u201d after what he called \u201ca vicious, calculated and despicable attack on law enforcement\u201d in Dallas. The White House announced Friday evening that the President would cut short his European trip by one day and visit Dallas early next week. It was the second somber statement about shootings on American soil the President made from Europe in less than 12 hours. He condemned the recent shootings by police of black men in Minnesota and Louisiana shortly after arriving in Europe and made a broad diagnosis of American racial imbalance. Hours later, after chaos erupted in Dallas and five police officers were killed in sniper shootings that began during protests stemming from the Minnesota and Louisiana shootings, he promised justice. \u201cThere is no possible justification for these kinds of attacks or any violence against law enforcement,\u201d Obama said, speaking from the NATO summit in Poland that he is attending. \u201cAnyone involved in the senseless murders will be held fully accountable. Justice will be done.\u201d Obama also ordered flags lowered to half staff at the White House and on public buildings and grounds. His overseas trip comes at a time when the country has been shaken by violence, during a week with fatal clashes between police and communities of color, ending with the shootings in Dallas, the single deadliest day for law enforcement since September 11, 2001. The events also come during a heated presidential election where issues of gun violence and criminal justice reform have been in the spotlight, and come just hours before presumptive Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton was scheduled to give a speech addressing the shootings from earlier in the week. \u201cI mourn for the officers shot while doing their sacred duty to protect peaceful protesters, for their families & all who serve with them. -H\u201d Clinton tweeted. I mourn for the officers shot while doing their sacred duty to protect peaceful protesters, for their families & all who serve with them. -H Spilling over to the campaign trail, presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump posted his condolences to his Twitter feed Friday morning. \u201cPrayers and condolences to all of the families who are so thoroughly devastated by the horrors we are all watching take place in our country,\u201d the real estate mogul wrote, a somber and measured statement from a candidate who has been an outspoken advocate for law enforcement throughout his campaign. He later sent a longer statement citing, \u201csenseless, tragic deaths of two motorists in Louisiana and Minnesota,\u201d a reference to the two black men killed earlier this week at the hands of law enforcement. Prayers and condolences to all of the families who are so thoroughly devastated by the horrors we are all watching take place in our country Others political figures blamed Obama for what they saw as rhetoric that led to police violence. Former congressman Joe Walsh tweeted and then deleted a message attributing the President\u2019s words and the Black Lives Matter movement for inciting violence. \u201c3 Dallas Cops killed, 7 wounded. This is now war. Watch out Obama. Watch out black lives matter punks. Real America is coming after you,\u201d Walsh, who\u2019s now a talk radio host, tweeted, later clarifying that he did not intend to call for violence. Even during the high-stakes summit focused on European unity, issues of race and violence dominated Obama\u2019s early agenda in Poland. Obama, who noted he\u2019s been receiving regular updates on the Dallas shootings, said he\u2019d conveyed condolences to the city\u2019s mayor, Mike Rawlings, and indicated the FBI was involved in investigating the shootings, which left five police officers dead. Obama said he would weigh in again when more is known about the killers\u2019 \u201ctwisted motivations.\u201d The President also made an implicit call for tighter gun restrictions, saying the carnage could have been mitigated if the killer or killers weren\u2019t carrying powerful weapons. \u201cToday is a wrenching reminder of the sacrifices they make for us,\u201d Obama said of law enforcement officers. \u201cWe also know when people are armed with powerful weapons, unfortunately, it makes attacks like these more deadly and more tragic.\u201d Obama said he wanted Friday to \u201cfocus is on the victims and their families.\u201d \u201cThey are heartbroken,\u201d Obama said. \u201cThe entire city of Dallas feels this to its core. We are grieving with them. I ask you say a prayer for the officers and their families. Keep them in your thoughts.\u201d Obama was speaking from Warsaw, where he arrived early Friday for a summit of NATO leaders. His remarks on Dallas came at the end of a session with the presidents of the European Council and European Commission, where Obama plotted a path forward after Britain\u2019s vote to exit the EU. After arriving in Poland in the early morning hours Friday, Obama went to his hotel and delivered a statement about two police-involved shootings this week, saying the episodes reflected persistent racial disparity. Citing statistics showing minorities are more likely to be pulled over, searched or shot at by police, Obama said it was incumbent on the country to aim for better \u2013 including recognizing deep-seated biases that he said must be \u201crooted out.\u201d \u201cIf communities are mistrustful of the police, that makes those law enforcement offers who are doing a great job, who are doing the right thing, that makes their lives harder,\u201d Obama said, insisting that recognizing problems within law enforcement doesn\u2019t equate to being anti-police. \u201cWhen people say \u2018black lives matter,\u2019 it doesn\u2019t mean that blue lives don\u2019t matter,\u201d Obama said, referring to police officers. \u201cBut right now, the data shows that black folks are more vulnerable to these kinds of incidents. There is a particular burden that is being placed on a group of our fellow citizens.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Dana Schwartz explains why she penned open letter to Donald Trump's son-in-law Jared Kushner, an adviser to his father-in-law, is Jewish and publisher of Schwartz's paper Donald Trump\u2019s son-in-law and adviser Jared Kushner wrote that Trump \u201cis not an anti-Semite\u201d in an op-ed published Wednesday afternoon in the New York Observer \u2013 the newspaper Kushner owns. Kushner\u2019s piece \u2013 titled \u201cThe Donald Trump I know\u201d \u2013 comes after an arts and entertainment writer at the paper published an open letter to Kushner asking for him to publicly condemn the campaign\u2019s use of \u201cblatant anti-Semitic imagery. \u201cThe article, titled \u201cAn Open Letter to Jared Kushner, From One of Your Jewish Employees,\u201d was written by Dana Schwartz and posted on the Observer website Tuesday afternoon. Kushner responded Wednesday, writing that \u201cthere are thoughtful points but journalists, even those who work for me at the Observer, are not always right.\u201d \u201cIn my opinion, accusations like \u2018racist\u2019 and \u2018anti-Semite\u2019 are being thrown around with a carelessness that risks rendering these words meaningless,\u201d Kushner wrote. \u201cIf even the slightest infraction against what the speech police have deemed correct speech is instantly shouted down with taunts of \u2018racist\u2019 then what is left to condemn the actual racists?\u201d he wrote. \u201cWhat do we call the people who won\u2019t hire minorities or beat others up for their religion?\u201d Kushner wrote of his grandmother\u2019s escape from the Holocaust, and how she met his grandfather \u2013 who\u2019d lived in a hole he\u2019d dug in the woods to hide from Nazis for three years. \u201cI go into these details, which I have never discussed, because it\u2019s important to me that people understand where I\u2019m coming from when I report that I know the difference between actual, dangerous intolerance versus these labels that get tossed around in an effort to score political points,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe difference between me and the journalists and Twitter throngs who find it so convenient to dismiss my father in law is simple. I know him and they don\u2019t.\u201d The 35-year-old publisher has been married to Trump\u2019s daughter, Ivanka, who converted to Judaism before their wedding, since 2009. As the presumptive Republican nominee\u2019s campaign has progressed, Kushner\u2019s influence within its often muddled hierarchy has grown. A recent New York Times profile described him in its headline as the candidate\u2019s \u201cquiet fixer.\u201d \u201cThe fact is that my father in law is an incredibly loving and tolerant person who has embraced my family and our Judaism since I began dating my wife. His support has been unwavering and from the heart. I have personally seen him embrace people of all racial and religious backgrounds, at his companies and in his personal life,\u201d Kushner wrote. Schwartz sat down Wednesday with CNN\u2019s Alisyn Camerota to explain why she addressed the issue to Kushner, whose publishing company owns the Observer. The letter was posted Tuesday on the Observer\u2019s website. The presumptive GOP presidential nominee set off a firestorm last weekend by tweeting a graphic of Hillary Clinton that featured a six-point star evoking the Star of David and a pile of cash with the words \u201cmost corrupt candidate ever.\u201d Observer writer urges owner \u2013 and Trump son-in-law \u2013 to condemn anti-Semitism \u201cIt was a personal issue,\u201d Schwartz, an entertainment writer, told CNN\u2019s \u201cNew Day.\u201d \u201cI responded immediately because I saw it as an anti-Semitic issue.\u201d Schwartz has never met Kushner but said she hoped her letter would compel him as a Trump adviser to take action. Kushner is Jewish and is married to Trump\u2019s daughter, Ivanka, who converted to Judaism. \u201cYou went to Harvard, and hold two graduate degrees,\u201d Schwartz wrote in her letter. \u201cPlease do not condescend to me and pretend you don\u2019t understand the imagery of a six-sided star when juxtaposed with money and accusations of financial dishonesty.\u201d Responding to criticism, Kushner had initially issued a statement calling his father-in-law \u201cincredibly loving and a tolerant person,\u201d adding that he has personally seen Trump embrace people of diverse backgrounds. But Schwartz said Kushner\u2019s response skirted the issue at hand. \u201cThe issue isn\u2019t whether Donald Trump as an individual is anti-Semitic,\u201d Schwartz told Camerota. \u201cThe question is whether his supporters are and whether he\u2019s encouraging that, and the answer is absolutely and unequivocally yes.\u201d After initially taking to Twitter to voice her concerns, Schwartz said she too faced a backlash, with many targeting her Judaism. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine he could see the type of tweets I\u2019m getting and think that\u2019s the type of country we want to live in, and that\u2019s what his father-in-law brings out in people.\u201d Neither Trump nor his campaign apologized for the tweet but deleted the original post and uploaded an edited graphic with a circle instead of the six-pointed star. Commenting about the controversy on Twitter, Trump blamed what he called the \u201cdishonest media\u201d for misinterpreting the image. \u201cHe\u2019s blaming people like me for reading too much into it,\u201d Schwartz said. \u201cI feel so silly and really ashamed that we\u2019re in an election where asking a candidate to disavow white supremacists is something we have to say.\u201d",

Like much of the Republican establishment\u2019s relationship with Trump, it\u2019s a little awkward: The National Republican Senatorial Committee sent out a fundraising email to supporters Friday urging them to sign up to endorse the presumptive GOP nominee. \u201cYou have the opportunity to endorse Donald J. Trump for president \u2013 even before convention makes it official,\u201d the message, one of many messages groups such as the NRSC send supporters to build their email lists and raise money, reads. \u201cDon\u2019t miss out to be among Mr. Trump\u2019s first endorsers! Add your name to confirm Mr. Trump can count on your vote in November.\u201d However, many of the group\u2019s own members in the Senate haven\u2019t taken that step. Mark Kirk of Illinois, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Ben Sasse of Nebraska have outright refused to endorse Trump. Other members, including Cory Gardner of Colorado and Ted Cruz of Texas, have been non-committal about whether they will support him, let alone formally endorse him. Maine Republican Sen. Susan Collins even told The New Yorker she would consider voting for Clinton, but later said she would support the GOP nominee. And Texas Sen. John Cornyn said he wouldn\u2019t answer another question about Trump until after the election. Many lawmakers have cited Trump\u2019s changing policy positions and divisive comments about racial minorities as the reason for their reluctance.

            "article_content": "\"Who do you like?\" Trump said at an event in Tampa, Florida Trump repeated -- or appeared to repeat -- only a few proposed picks As Donald Trump continues to eschew traditional methods of campaigning, he likely added on Saturday another first in the annals of modern presidential politics: polling a campaign rally crowd for ideas on who he should select as a running mate. \u201cWho do you like?\u201d Trump said at an event here, putting his hand to his ear as the crowd erupted in a cacophony of names. Trump repeated \u2013 or appeared to repeat \u2013 only a few proposed picks, including former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions and former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice. \u201cHe says Newt,\u201d Trump said first. RELATED: Trump laments lack of GOP unity \u2014 but keeps up criticism Gingrich has been floated as a potential vice presidential pick, but speculation swirled that he would no longer be considered after Gingrich unleashed on Trump over his recent racial criticism of a U.S. federal judge. \u201cThey say Sessions,\u201d Trump then said, as the crowd continued to roar. Sessions, who was the first sitting senator to endorse Trump, currently chairs Trump\u2019s group of foreign policy advisers and has been Trump\u2019s most vocal supporter in Washington. A few seconds passed, and Trump leaned into the microphone to help another name rise above the fray. \u201cHe says Condi Rice,\u201d Trump said, gesturing to another supporter. RELATED: Romney tears into GOP for not criticizing Trump Picking Rice would undoubtedly be a bold move in an election season in which Hillary Clinton, has already made history as the first woman to lead a major-party ticket. Donald Trump: Mitt Romney 'let us down' But Rice would also be an incongruous selection for Trump, who has railed against the Iraq War and the foreign policy of former President George W. Bush administration. Rice served as Bush\u2019s national security adviser before becoming secretary of state and was one of the administration\u2019s most vocal advocates for the war, playing a key role in crafting the administration\u2019s Iraq War policies. Before asking for the crowd\u2019s feedback on picking a running mate, Trump also praised former Texas Gov. Rick Perry, who has been floated as a potential pick and has said he would be open to serving as vice president. Trump has said that his shortlist is down to a handful of names and assured the crowd Saturday that \u201cwe have a lot of good people, you\u2019ll be happy.\u201d The billionaire has said that he is looking for a vice president with government experience who can help him get his agenda passed through Congres. But he also said in a recent interview with Bloomberg Politics that \u201ctwo veep finalists are respected military officials.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Sanders met with Obama for the second time this primary season He also met with Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid Democrats took giant steps toward party unity Thursday as Bernie Sanders vowed to work together with Hillary Clinton to defeat Donald Trump in November and President Barack Obama and Vice President Joe Biden formally endorsed Clinton for president. Sanders\u2019 decision to continue his White House bid even after Clinton became the party\u2019s presumptive presidential nominee has had Democrats on high alert as they seek to quickly change gears and take on Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee. Sanders\u2019 first explicit promise on Thursday to join forces with Clinton to take on the Republicans will help quell concerns among Democrats about divisions in the party. Emerging from the White House after a meeting with Obama that lasted more than an hour, Sanders warned that a Trump presidency would be a \u201cdisaster\u201d and that he would \u201cwork as hard as I can to make sure that Donald Trump does not become president of the United States.\u201d Progressive senator expects Sanders will campaign with Clinton \u201cI look forward to meeting with (Clinton) in the near future to see how we can work together to defeat Donald Trump and to create a government which represents all of us and not just the 1%,\u201d Sanders told reporters. The senator thanked both Obama and Biden for showing \u201cimpartiality\u201d during the course of the Democratic campaign. \u201cThey said in the beginning that they would not put their thumb on the scales and they kept their word and I appreciate that very, very much,\u201d Sanders said. He added that he will monitor a \u201cfull counting of the votes\u201d in California, where Clinton won the Democratic primary contest on Tuesday. The results will show \u201ca much closer vote,\u201d Sanders predicted. Clinton, Trump battle on Twitter: \u2018Delete your account\u2019 In a press briefing Thursday afternoon, White House spokesman Josh Earnest described the meeting as a \u201cfriendly conversation that was focused on the future,\u201d and said Obama congratulated Sanders on his \u201cremarkable accomplishment\u201d in the Democratic race. Shortly after the meeting, the White House released a video in which Obama enthusiastically backed Clinton and acknowledged the historic achievement of her becoming the first woman to win a major party\u2019s presidential nomination. He will join Clinton on the campaign trail for the first time next week in Wisconsin. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s ever been someone so qualified to hold this office,\u201d Obama said in the video of Clinton, whom he defeated eight years ago. He also thanked Sanders in the video for running an \u201cincredible campaign\u201d and for shining a spotlight on issues such as economic inequality and the influence of money in politics. Warren: Trump like Ryan, McConnell in GOP\u2019s \u2018full-scale assault\u2019 on judiciary Sanders\u2019 high-profile meeting with Obama and his public remarks afterward come just days after Sanders declared that he intends to continue his 2016 campaign. At a rally Tuesday night, Sanders had declined to acknowledge that Clinton had secured the necessary delegates to win her party\u2019s nomination. He vowed to forge ahead to the District of Columbia\u2019s primary next week, and then on to the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia. Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta said their camp would would like to quickly mend fences and unify the party. \u201cNothing has been scheduled yet, but I think both sides want to make sure that it happens and happens soon,\u201d Podesta told CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer. He added that they would \u201cwelcome\u201d Sanders campaigning for Clinton. \u201cIf you go back to 2008 after it became clear that President Obama had won the pledged delegates and was going to be the nominee of the Democratic party, that\u2019s exactly what Hillary did,\u201d he said. \u201cEven after that hard-fought campaign, she went out and endorsed him, asked that his name be put into the nomination by acclimation, she campaigned with him.\u201d The Sanders-Obama meeting Thursday marked the two men\u2019s second White House sitdown this primary season and the fourth time they\u2019ve spoken in the last month. White House officials hoped Obama could prod the Vermont senator toward eventually acting as a unifying figure for the Democratic Party. In a taping of \u201cThe Tonight Show\u201d with Jimmy Fallon on Wednesday, Obama said he was hopeful that the party will \u201cpull things together.\u201d \u201cThe main role I\u2019m going to be playing in this process is to remind the American people that this is a serious job,\u201d Obama said. \u201cYou know, this is not reality TV. I\u2019ve seen the decisions that have to be made and the work that has to be done.\u201d Since clinching her party\u2019s nomination, Clinton has stuck to a conciliatory tone when it comes to her rival. In her victory speech in Brooklyn Tuesday night, Clinton congratulated Sanders for an \u201cextraordinary campaign\u201d and sought to reach out to his supporters. \u201cLet there be no mistake: Sen. Sanders, his campaign, and the vigorous debate that we\u2019ve had about how to raise incomes, reduce inequality, and increase upward mobility, have been very good for the Democratic Party and for America,\u201d Clinton said. Thursday helped shed light on Sanders\u2019 intentions and state of mind \u2013 particularly the role he hopes to play in his party \u2013 as the general election kicks off in earnest. Sanders sat down in the afternoon with his longtime friend and Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, who has publicly said Sanders should \u201cgive up.\u201d Reid described the meeting to reporters afterward as a \u201cgood visit,\u201d and emphasized that Sanders has the good will of the Senate Democratic caucus. The Nevada senator said Sanders made no mention of changing the reality that Clinton is the party\u2019s presumptive nominee, and quipped that Sanders appears to have \u201caccepted that.\u201d Donald Trump\u2019s ground game Reid also echoed other Democratic leaders, saying, \u201cI\u2019m not pushing him to do anything.\u201d Prior to that meeting, one source familiar with Reid\u2019s thinking said he believes Sanders can be helpful in Senate races, including in raising money, and is open to any number of ways to unite the party. Sanders also met with Biden late Thursday afternoon to discuss some of the issues central to his campaign, including income inequality, big money in politics and \u201cthe need to reform our politics,\u201d according to a statement from Biden\u2019s office. Later in the evening during a speech in Washington, Biden endorsed Clinton, saying \u201cGod willing,\u201d the former secretary of state would be the next president. Warren, with an eye on Sanders, moves closer to Clinton endorsement To cap off a whirlwind day of meetings, Sanders held an evening campaign rally in Southeast Washington. The senator delivered his usual stump speech, touching on issues of economic, social, racial and environmental justice. But his remarks also reflected on the arc of his unlikely campaign and what he and his supporters have achieved over the last year. The pundits had underestimated his political revolution, Sanders said. \u201cWell, here we are \u2013 it\u2019s mid-June, and we\u2019re still standing.\u201d At the event, Sanders supporters acknowledged that the senator was unlikely to be the Democratic nominee for president. They expressed a mix of disappointment and pride \u2013 and frustration with what they said was a lack of viable options. Sam Mbulaiteye, a researcher from Silver Spring, Maryland, said he was disappointed that Obama endorsed Clinton earlier in the day. \u201cI think Bernie\u2019s message is closer to Obama\u2019s message in 2008 \u2013 it\u2019s a message of change, hope and about the future,\u201d Mbulaiteye, 50, said. Mbulaiteye was undecided on whether to support Clinton or Trump in the general election. \u201cIn terms of being anti-establishment, Trump is closer to Bernie Sanders,\u201d he said. Jenn Fendrick, a 32-year-old stay-at-home-mom from Fairfax, Virginia, lamented \u201cthe end of an era\u201d and said she would vote for Clinton in November \u2013 but \u201cnot enthusiastically.\u201d This is \u201chopefully not the end of his movement, though,\u201d she said of Sanders. \u201cHe\u2019s definitely too old to run again.\u201d CNN\u2019s Greg Wallace, Rachel Chason, Kevin Liptak and Manu Raju contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Sanders said he plans to compete in next Tuesday's Washington, DC, primary Sanders: 'I want to thank all of you for being part of a political revolution' Despite a night of disappointing losses, Bernie Sanders vowed Tuesday night to continue his campaign and to take his fight all the way to the convention in Philadelphia. While Hillary Clinton secured the delegates she needed Monday to become the presumptive presidential nominee, Sanders channeled the defiance of his supporters as he took the stage shortly before 11 p.m. PT. The crowd was on edge \u2013 angry with the press and worried that he would give in to the growing pressure from Democratic leaders to bow out of the race. But it wasn\u2019t long before it became clear from his remarks that his \u201cmovement\u201d \u2013 a campaign that has given Clinton more of a fight than anyone predicted and forced the Democratic Party to the left \u2013 would carry on, at least through the final primary next Tuesday in Washington, D.C. \u201cAll of you know that when we began this campaign over a year ago we were considered to be a fringe campaign. Over the last year I think that has changed a little bit,\u201d he said as the crowd thundered with approval. \u201cLet me thank you all for being part of a political revolution,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cWe understand our mission is more than just beating Donald Trump, it is transforming our country.\u201d The Vermont senator said he had spoken to President Barack Obama and to Clinton, though the crowd booed when he said he had offered her his congratulations on her victories Tuesday night. He noted his victories in North Dakota and Montana, and said he believed the gap between him and Clinton in California would narrow as results continued to trickle in. \u201cNext Tuesday we continue the fight,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are going to fight hard to win the primary in Washington, D.C., and then we take our fight for social, economic, racial and environmental justice to Philadelphia.\u201d \u201cThe struggle continues,\u201d he added. Though some Clinton supporters have pushed for Sanders to drop out for the sake of party unity, at least high profile Democrat was urging patience Wednesday morning. Vice President Joe Biden, in comments to CNN, urged Democrats to be \u201ca little graceful\u201d and to give him time to make his decision. Some election night parties take on subdued and funeral tone when the numbers have not settled in the candidate\u2019s favor, but that was not the case here among the legions of \u201cBernie or Bust\u201d supporters who flocked to his final California rally. Some carried signs urging him to mount an independent run; many said they would write him in this fall if Clinton becomes the nominee. Clinton had already claimed victory in New York when Sanders supporters began filling a cavernous airplane hangar in Santa Monica airport, but few said they had listened to her speech. Many were seething with anger at what they viewed as the news networks\u2019 premature call for Clinton. Before Sanders arrived a huge video screen towering above the crowd showed California\u2019s early returns\u2014with Sanders losing by a large margin\u2014the crowd shouted \u201cBulls\u2014t! Bullsh\u2014t.\u201d When the channel flipped to CNN \u2013 again showing the evening\u2019s strong results for Clinton \u2013 the crowd thundered: \u201cTurn it off! Turn it off!\u201d Many brushed off the notion that it was a historic night for Clinton, with some arguing that she had sold out to \u201cthe system\u201d and could not be trusted as the Democratic nominee When Clinton talks about breaking the highest, hardest glass ceiling, said Jennifer Hernandez: \u201cI don\u2019t think she\u2019s broken anything.\u201d \u201cShe\u2019s clearly bought and stolen her way to the top \u2014 and she\u2019s been with the establishment for a really long time. She\u2019s been their nominee from the beginning, which was very unfair for Bernie,\u201d Hernandez said. This fall if Clinton is the nominee, Hernandez said, she will write in Sanders on her ballot or vote for the Green Party\u2019s Jill Stein. Melissa Baldridge, a 39-year-old digital marketing recruiter, said she was angered by what she saw as a rush to anoint Clinton. \u201cEverybody in the mainstream media is in such a rush to have the story first that they call things prematurely,\u201d said Baldridge, who said she switched her registration from Republican to Democrat to vote for Sanders. She noted that superdelegates do not officially vote until the Democratic Convention next month, and insisted that they should not be counted until then. \u201cBy announcing that she had (the nomination), a lot of people decided to stay home. That\u2019s a form of voter repression.\u201d Like many Sanders supporters, Baldridge said the hundreds of superdelegates who backed Clinton early in the process have a duty to reconsider their decision. \u201cIf they are saying that they are for the people; that they are going to reflect the sentiments and the feelings of the people \u2013 how can announce their allegiance so early on?

            "article_content": "NEW: Hillary Clinton will win the California Democratic primary, CNN projects Trump's speech strikes conventional note amid controversy Hillary Clinton embraced her moment in history Tuesday, becoming the first woman in the 240-year life of the United States to lead the presidential ticket of a major political party. \u201cThanks to you, we\u2019ve reached a milestone,\u201d she said during a speech in Brooklyn. \u201cTonight\u2019s victory is not about one person. It belongs to generations of women and men who struggled and sacrificed and made this moment possible.\u201d After three decades at the center of American politics as a pioneering \u2013 and deeply controversial \u2013 feminist icon, the victory brings Clinton, 68, within reach of finally cracking the \u201chighest, hardest glass ceiling\u201d she lamented eight years ago when she conceded the Democratic race to Barack Obama. The former first lady, senator from New York and secretary of state will now face presumptive Republican nominee Donald Trump in a general election battle that is already shaping up as one of the nastiest campaigns in modern U.S. history. Clinton has pounced on Trump\u2019s business record, character and tendency to use his platform to wage personal grudge matches to try to define him early on in the minds of voters as unfit for the presidency. Trump, for his part, is aiming to portray Clinton as a consistent liar who can\u2019t be trusted. Though Clinton already has Trump in her sights, she has work to do to unify her own party after a grueling battle against Bernie Sanders. The Vermont senator spoke before a roaring crowd of his own in California to declare \u201cthe struggle continues.\u201d The Vermont senator pledged to stay in the race through next week\u2019s primary in Washington, D.C., and to fight on for social, economic, racial and environmental justice at the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia. President Barack Obama, who waited until voting ended in the last six primary states to weigh in on the race, called both candidates to congratulate them for \u201crunning inspiring campaigns that have energized Democrats,\u201d according to a White House statement. Primary results maps But the President, who will meet with Sanders Thursday at the Vermont senator\u2019s request, clearly sided with Clinton by lauding her for \u201csecuring the delegates necessary to clinch the Democratic nomination for President.\u201d \u201cHer historic campaign inspired millions and is an extension of her lifelong fight for middle-class families and children,\u201d the statement said. Reaching the highest peak yet in a tumultuous and trailblazing political career, Clinton claimed victory exactly eight years after folding her 2008 Democratic primary campaign against Obama. Meet the women who came to see Clinton make history Her long-awaited moment of celebration came as she notched wins in the night\u2019s primaries in California, New Jersey, South Dakota and New Mexico Democratic primaries, according to CNN projections. Clinton took the stage in Brooklyn to an explosion of cheers from her crowd, in the kind of eruption of enthusiasm that has been fleeting during much of her campaign. Clearly delighted, she stood with her arms outstretched on stage, savoring the adulation. Reaching out to Sanders supporters, Clinton praised the Vermont senator for his long public service and mirrored some of his progressive economic rhetoric. She played down any notion of divisions and said their vigorous primary campaign was \u201cvery good for the Democratic Party and for America.\u201d But in a sign of the task she faces in uniting the party, Sanders supporters loudly booed her name when he said he had received a \u201cgracious\u201d call from his rival and said he had congratulated her on her victories on Tuesday. World\u2019s strongest women? Sanders confounded the notion that the end of the state primary races would mean the end of his campaign. \u201cNext Tuesday, we continue the fight in the last primary in Washington DC,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cWe are going to fight hard to win the primary in Washington, D.C., and then we take our fight for social, economic, racial and environmental justice to Philadelphia.\u201d \u201cI am pretty good at arithmetic and I know that the fight in front of us in a very, very steep fight.\u201d But Sanders vowed to fight on for every delegate and every vote. While Sanders signaled that he was not yet ready to fold a campaign that started with him as a fringe candidate and ignited a startling grass roots uprising that won more than 10 million votes, Clinton looked ahead to the general election. Clinton intensified her assault on Trump, laying out a case that his values and rhetoric are incompatible with American principles and that he\u2019s \u201ctemperamentally unfit\u201d to be President. Nightcap: The latest news and political buzz from CNN Politics | Sign up \u201cHe is not just trying to build a wall between America and Mexico. He is trying to wall of Americans from each other. When he says let\u2019s make America great again, that is code for let\u2019s take American backwards.\u201d She hit Trump hard for his recent attacks on a judge with Mexican ancestry along with mocking a disabled reporter and calling \u201cwomen pigs.\u201d Hillary Clinton's life in the spotlight \u201cHe wants to win by stoking fear and rubbing salt in wounds and reminding us daily just how great he is.\u201d Clinton also signaled a robust challenge to Trump resonating with gender and personal themes. She spoke of how her late mother, Dorothy Rodham, taught her \u201cnever to back down from a bully.\u201d Sanders faces an existential campaign question. He is grappling with whether to honor his vow to fight on to the Democratic National Convention next month or accept the electoral mathematics that give him no viable path to victory and join Clinton to unite a party divided by a much more competitive primary race than expected. CNN\u2019s Brianna Keilar reported that the campaign managers for Clinton and Sanders are in touch, keeping the lines of communication open so they can eventually unify the party, according to a source familiar with the conversations. The New York Times reported the Sanders campaign is about to undergo a significant reduction in staff. A top campaign official would neither confirm nor deny the report to CNN. But notably, as the campaign reaches the end of the primary season, the campaign has not moved to staff key battleground states and little appears in the works beyond recent promises to fight to the convention. For Trump, the question Tuesday was how he would extricate himself from the political hole opened up by his controversial comments about a judge of Mexican descent who is overseeing a lawsuit aimed at Trump University. His accusation that the judge is biased because of his ethnicity has horrified senior GOP leaders who recently reluctantly endorsed him. He tried to neutralize the furor with a statement Tuesday saying his comments had been \u201cmisconstrued.\u201d Here\u2019s everything you\u2019ve forgotten about Hillary Clinton Amid the furor, Trump, who won the Republican contests Tuesday, delivered a more conventional speech that seemed a departure from the free wheeling approach he often takes. Using a teleprompter \u2013 notable for someone who has blasted Clinton for being scripted \u2013 Trump attacked Clinton and called for GOP unity. For one night at least, it seemed that the unpredictable billionaire had heeded calls by the GOP establishment \u2013 which he built a campaign on vilifying \u2013 to rein himself in for the good of the party. \u201cWe are only getting started and it is going to be beautiful,\u201d he said. He didn\u2019t mention the judge during his speech and instead sought to convey that he understood his new role as the leader of the GOP. \u201cI understand the responsibility of carrying the mantle and I will never, ever let you down,\u201d he said. A top campaign adviser told CNN\u2019s Jim Acosta that Trump\u2019s speech was \u201cvery important to recovering from these five bad days.\u201d CNN\u2019s Maeve Reston, Elizabeth Landers and Jeff Zeleny contributed to this story",

Hillary Clinton's life in the spotlight Trump\u2019s standing in the poll, released Wednesday, shows an improvement for the billionaire businessman from a Fox national poll in April showing Clinton on top, 48% to 41%.

            "article_content": "Get ready for a likely U.S. Supreme Court showdown over North Carolina\u2019s so-called bathroom law. Nobody is sure when, but it\u2019s probably coming. The state sued the feds Monday, and the federal government quickly returned the favor, staging a fight over the law that would require North Carolinians to use public bathrooms that correspond with their biological sex. Name: Public Facilities Privacy and Security ActWhen it passed: March 23Who voted for it: The bill passed the state House 82-26 and the state Senate 32-0, with Senate Democrats walking out and not voting in protest.What it does: The new law puts in place a statewide policy that bans individuals from using public bathrooms that do not correspond to their biological sex. It also stops cities from passing anti-discrimination ordinances to protect gay and transgender people.What happens next: A federal lawsuit has been filed over the measure. The state\u2019s attorney general says he won\u2019t defend it in court. But in the court of public opinion, Gov. Pat McCrory and other supporters of the measure have staunchly stood behind it, saying it\u2019s about protecting privacy. There are reasons scholars and attorneys don\u2019t expect the federal lawsuits to bring a swift resolution. Let\u2019s look at a few: 1. There is conflicting case law \u2013 as evidenced by the cases cited in this week\u2019s lawsuits. While federal courts have ruled previously on transgender rights, those rulings sit at opposite ends and span multiple court circuits, according to Danielle McLaughlin, a government investigations attorney with New York\u2019s Nixon Peabody and constitutional law blogger. The likelihood of the Supreme Court stepping in will spike in the event that federal appeals courts begin to butt heads, too, she said.2. The issue pits North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory and those who believe the law is about \u201cbodily privacy\u201d against President Barack Obama\u2019s Justice Department and those who believe the law discriminates against a class of people. Neither side is expected to accept a lower court decision that doesn\u2019t jibe with its stance. McCrory has repeatedly expressed his intent to keep the law intact, but \u201cthere are no questions here as to the direction of the Department of Justice and the resources it wants to put toward fighting discrimination,\u201d McLaughlin said. 3. To quote Bob Dylan, the times they are a-changin\u2019. Opinions are evolving when it comes to transgender rights, creating a rift among the public. Look no further than the split highlighted in a CNN/ORC poll this week that showed 57% of people opposed laws that forced transgender folks to use bathrooms that correspond with their birth certificates rather than gender identities. \u201cThis is an important issue that people are interested in. The (Supreme Court) isn\u2019t going to want to have conflict on this issue for very long,\u201d said Katharine Bartlett, a Duke University law professor and former dean at the school. North Carolina files lawsuit over bathroom law So with those thoughts in mind, there remain many questions about how the issue might play out, but ultimately, if the Supreme Court steps in, justices would be charged with deciding whether transgender individuals are protected under federal law. The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has been clear that discrimination against transgender people is tantamount to sex discrimination, but that relates only to Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, which deals with employment discrimination. In its lawsuit, the Justice Department also alleges violations of Title IX of the Civil Rights Act, which addresses discrimination in schools, the Education Act and the Violence Against Women Reauthorization Act. There\u2019s a little confusion here. McCrory and his public safety director sued the Justice Department in U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of North Carolina\u2019s Western Division. That\u2019s also where state House Speaker Tim Moore and Senate President Pro Tem Phil Berger filed a separate suit against the Justice Department. The Justice Department filed its case in U.S. District Court for the Middle District of North Carolina. The two courts could take up the cases and decide them separately, and if their rulings conflicted, it would spur a decision from the 4th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals. North Carolina would have to abide by the appellate ruling until the high court stepped in, Bartlett said. However, she points out, there\u2019s another option: consolidating the cases. But the federal Manual for Complex Litigation says, \u201cPlaintiffs\u2019 choice of forum is \u2026 entitled to substantial deference.\u201d The recent CNN/ORC poll indicated that just 5% of those polled had no opinion on the issue, and 38% were in favor of making transgender people use the bathroom consistent with their birth certificates. So, while there is a significant divide over the issue, most everyone has an opinion. Does North Carolina law endanger transgender citizens? Also, the shift in opinion, much like that on same-sex marriage, comes from a growing understanding of issues facing the transgender community, Bartlett said. Where people didn\u2019t understand, felt threatened or were content to ignore the matter before, now \u201cthere is a greater societal understanding of the phenomenon and acceptance of it,\u201d she said. That\u2019s true for all members of the lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender community, she said. Those fighting to expand transgender rights have taken a page from activists who pushed for gay and abortion rights, McLaughlin said. That page says: Put the issue out there and force a discussion. \u201cThe way to make change is to come out of the shadows and have a conversation on a national stage and not be apologetic about what they\u2019re seeking,\u201d she said. \u201cGroups seek to change the interpretation of statutory language file complaints, and hope that ultimately the Supreme Court will hear their case, or another like it, and agree the statutory interpretation should be changed.\u201d Gov. Pat McCrory defends North Carolina's bathroom law Not at all. McCrory has repeatedly said that what happens in North Carolina will have national ramifications. And as the polls and slew of state religious freedom bills show, McCrory and his supporters are hardly the only ones interested in pursuing this type of legislation. What both sides are requesting, essentially, is \u201cPlease interpret these statutes for us. We want clarity. We think we\u2019re right,\u201d McLaughlin said. For now, the issue may seem like it solely pertains to North Carolina, but in the likelihood that the 4th Circuit issues a ruling \u2013 and then another federal appellate court reaches a conflicting conclusion \u2013 the Supreme Court will more than likely step in. It\u2019s likely neither the Justice Department nor North Carolina would settle for anything less. \u201cEither side would want to take this all the way to the Supreme Court,\u201d McLaughlin said. \u201cIt\u2019s an emerging issue of national importance.\u201d Anybody\u2019s guess. McLaughlin feels the Obama administration\u2019s refusal to defend the Defense of Marriage Act serves as \u201ca harbinger of a broader acknowledgment of the rights of Americans and what our rights actually look like,\u201d and DOMA is a similar animal. North Carolina\u2019s law will most likely be left to the Supreme Court. It could take two years or more for the court to decide the issue, McLaughlin said. And with a presidential election in the balance, the leanings of a new, ninth justice will be unknown. U.S. sues North Carolina over bathroom law Bartlett points out the court may take into consideration that North Carolina\u2019s law is an aggressive statute that was passed swiftly with little legislative debate or public input. From her perch, Bartlett said, it seems that \u201cif transgender discrimination is sex discrimination under Title VII (of the Civil Rights Act), there\u2019s no reason it shouldn\u2019t be under Title IX.\u201d Also, she said, if a state strives to apply laws targeting only those who have changed their gender or are in the process of changing their gender, \u201cit\u2019s hard to say that is anything but discrimination based on their sex.\u201d Not really, but kind of. DOMA mandated that marriage was between only one man and one woman before the Obama administration said it would no longer defend it, and the Supreme Court ultimately struck down a key part of it. U.S. Attorney General Loretta Lynch has likened North Carolina\u2019s act to Jim Crow laws under segregation and cast it as a discriminatory response to progress, but  the courts have long had a lower tolerance for racial discrimination than other types of discrimination, McLaughlin said. You may be asking: The courts assign levels to discrimination? Absolutely. Can women be drafted into the military? Are rich people treated differently than poor people in the tax code? Aren\u2019t single individuals taxed differently than married ones? Were you allowed to drive before you were 16? Booze before 21? Can you collect Social Security before you\u2019re in your 60s? \u201cCourts have different tests depending on the nature of the discrimination,\u201d McLaughlin said. What will be key is whether the courts feel the characteristics being discriminated against are immutable, such as a person\u2019s skin color. Lynch is well aware of this, as the Justice Department wrote in its lawsuit, \u201cGender identity is innate and external efforts to change a person\u2019s gender identity can be harmful to the person\u2019s health and well-being.\u201d Needless to say, if and when the Supreme Court makes a decision, it will be a landmark one that will change the face of transgender rights no matter which way it rules. If it sides with North Carolina, expect other states to push similar legislation. If it sides with the Justice Department, expect dominoes to fall, as they did with DOMA. \u201cWhat the DOJ and EEOC are doing is working to obtain law change \u2013 they want federal district courts to broaden the definition of \u2018sex\u2019 discrimination to specifically encompass these groups,\u201d McLaughlin said. \u201cThe Supreme Court will have the final say on it, should it decide to take up a transgender case like this.\u201d",

Joe Sestak. McGinty, a former chief of staff to Gov. Tom Wolf, will now face off against first-term GOP Sen. Pat Toomey \u2013 in one of the country\u2019s most high profile Senate races. \u201cKatie McGinty has the best chance of beating Toomey \u2013 we always felt that way,\u201d said Sen. Chuck Schumer, the likely next Democratic leader who helped recruit McGinty to run against Sestak. \u201cWe want to beat him.\u201d McGinty\u2019s victory came just hours after party leaders scored another victory \u2013 this time in Maryland, with the victory of Rep. Chris Van Hollen over the progressive Rep. Donna Edwards, who had the backing of liberal women\u2019s groups in the contentious race. While the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee was neutral in Maryland, Van Hollen had the backing of many top Democrats, including Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid, in a race that fractured along gender and racial lines. Van Hollen is heavily favored to succeed liberal Sen. Barbara Mikulski in the Democratic state, where he\u2019ll face off against Republican Kathy Szeliga this fall. Also on Tuesday, Rep. Chaka Fattah, a veteran Democratic congressman indicted on corruption charges last year, lost his primary to state Rep. Dwight Evans in the battle to represent the Philadelphia-area district. But the Pennsylvania Senate race has the biggest implication of Tuesday night\u2019s down-ticket races, with Toomey\u2019s seat at the heart of the national Democratic effort to retake the Senate majority. Democrats in Washington calculated that McGinty was a superior candidate over Sestak, who has a history fraught with tension with his congressional delegation and party leadership. \u201cNot at all,\u201d said Rep. Bob Brady, a 10-term congressman, when asked if Sestak works well with others. \u201cHe dances to the beat of his own drum. We need people to be cooperative and work together.\u201d The fact that Democrats have so aggressively targeted Sestak has been rather remarkable given that the former two-term congressman lost by just two points when he faced off against Toomey in 2010. But it\u2019s how Sestak waged that campaign that has kept tensions raw with party bosses. Republicans are eager to capitalize. \u201cNeedless to say, a divisive primary hurts the Democratic nominee,\u201d Sen. Roger Wicker, chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, said of the race. \u201cWe\u2019re not shedding any tears about the fact that it\u2019s been a rough-and-tumble primary.\u201d \u201cMs. McGinty is not the best when it comes to discussing issues,\u201d Wicker told CNN. \u201cShe leaves a lot to be desired when it comes to articulating Pennsylvania values.\u201d Shortly after President Barack Obama was sworn into office in 2009, Biden and Democratic leaders wooed the late-Sen. Arlen Specter, a long-time moderate Republican, to switch parties, effectively giving the White House a resounding supermajority in the chamber. The party establishment agreed to back Specter in the 2010 Senate race, but Sestak wouldn\u2019t listen. Despite an aggressive lobbying campaign urging Sestak to bow out, he surprised his colleagues by announcing a run \u2013 a move that energized the left-flank of his party that distrusted the long-time Republican Specter. Further embarrassing the White House, Sestak said that the Obama administration offered him a job to stay out of the race \u2013 something that became a major distraction in the early days of the new White House. With the backing of the base, Sestak won the primary but barely lost to Toomey in a tea-party-dominated election cycle. As the 2016 election began to move closer, Sestak made clear that he wanted to run again \u2013 prompting concerns from party elders. The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee and Reid tried to make amends, meeting with Sestak and urging him to name veteran party operatives to professionalize his staff and begin raising loads of cash. Yet the two sides never saw eye-to-eye, and Sestak took the unusual but headline-grabbing move of walking 422 miles across the state. The DSCC, Schumer and Reid began to court other candidates but ran into resistance, including when Josh Shapiro, chairman of the Montgomery County Board of Commissioners, passed on a Senate bid. They then turned to McGinty, who threw her hat into the ring last summer. The party establishment has pulled out all the stops, including with Biden stumping with McGinty this week and the DSCC spending at least $1.1 million on TV so far. Sestak has been unsparing in his criticism of the party elite. \u201cMore than anything, I want the trust of the people I will serve; that I am for them,\u201d Sestak said in a recent statement. \u201cIt is why I have not asked for any politician\u2019s endorsement. Perhaps too many of our politicians in both parties have acquiesced \u2026 and maybe that is why the general public \u2013 from the old tea party to today\u2019s progressive Democrats \u2013 have felt attracted to those who seem to break the system.\u201d Sen. Bob Casey, the senior Democratic senator, threw his support behind McGinty as well but said he would work to repair the wounds after Tuesday night. \u201cNo matter what the results are tonight, we will unify,\u201d Casey said. Asked how the party would do that, Casey said: \u201cHard work \u2013 and time.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Bernie Sanders failed Sunday to explain the logic behind his analysis that he was losing to Hillary Clinton because \u201cpoor people don\u2019t vote\u201d when confronted with the fact that the poorest voters support her, according to exit polls. He also said his remaining path to win the nomination is not easy. Sanders had said on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d that he was trailing Clinton for the nomination because \u201cpoor people don\u2019t vote. I mean, that\u2019s just a fact. That\u2019s a sad reality of American society. And that\u2019s what we have to transform.\u201d But when CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper noted that exit polls show Clinton wins 55% of voters making less than $50,000 to Sanders\u2019 44%, Sanders pivoted his argument. Resetting red and blue in the Rust Belt \u201cOne of the reasons I am running for president of the United States is to try to revitalize American Democracy. It is not a secret that we have one of the lowest voting turnout rates of any major country on Earth,\u201d Sanders told Tapper on \u201cState of the Union\u201d Sunday. \u201cAnd it is also true that in the last general election we had in 2014, 63% of the American people didn\u2019t vote. And the numbers were worse for low-income people and the numbers were worse for young people.\u201d Sanders added that he\u2019s surprised at how well he\u2019s done so far in his campaign. \u201cYou know Jake, if you and I were talking 11 (or) 11-and-a-half months ago, you would not have believed that we would be here, where we are right now,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have won 16 states at this point and that we\u2019re running very close to Secretary Clinton in the general election matchups, and in fact we\u2019re beating Trump by rather large numbers.\u201d Asked directly if there was any chance he could win the nomination, Sanders said there was. \u201cI\u2019m not going to tell you that it\u2019s easy, but I think we do,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cWhat polls seem to be showing is that many of the states yet to come, including California, our largest state we have a real shot to win.\u201d READ: Biden mum on whether he voted for Clinton or Sanders He also declined to condemn comments by his surrogate, Rosario Dawson, who said Saturday she stands with Monica Lewinsky\u2019s fight against bullying and suggested that the Clinton campaign is engaging in such behavior. Sanders on Sunday defended Dawson\u2019s overall speech but declined specific comment on the Lewinsky reference. \u201cWe are literally under attack for not just supporting the other candidate. Now I\u2019m with Monica Lewinsky with this: Bullying is bad. She\u2019s actually dedicated her life now to talking about that,\u201d Dawson had said, before introducing the Vermont senator on-stage at a rally. She added: \u201cAnd now as a campaign strategy, we are being bullied and somehow that is OK and not being talked about with the richness that it needs to (be).\u201d Find your presidential match with the 2016 Candidate Matchmaker Sanders, when asked by Tapper about it, called Dawson a great actress and said: \u201cShe\u2019s doing a great job for us.\u201d \u201cShe\u2019s been a passionate fighter to see that we increase the voter turnout, that we fight for racial, economic, environmental justice,\u201d he said. But when pressed by Tapper if it was OK for her to bring up Lewinsky, Sanders said: \u201cI have no idea in what context Rosario was talking about her. But I would hope that all of our people would focus on the real issues facing working people and the massive level of wealth and income inequality.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Lawmakers said there were some working-class and primarily Latino neighborhoods that had no polling places Maricopa County had 60 polling stations, down from at least 200 in 2012 The Department of Justice is requesting additional information from an Arizona election official after lawmakers and activists alleged voter suppression during the Arizona presidential primary last month. Democratic lawmakers have claimed there were some working-class and primarily Latino neighborhoods that had no polling places. Chris Herren, chief of the Justice Department\u2019s Voting Section, sent a letter to Maricopa County Recorder Helen Purcell after voters complained of waiting for hours to vote due to an insufficient number of polling stations. \u201cWe have received reports that a number of Maricopa County voters waited several hours to cast a ballot on election day,\u201d said Herren\u2019s letter, which was sent late last week. \u201cWe also understand that there were allegations of disproportionate burden in waiting times to vote on election day in some areas with substantial racial or language minority populations.\u201d Justice Department officials have requested that Purcell send them information by April 22 on various information, including a complete list of registered voters, data on voters and staff at each polling place location and county procedures for recording political party registration. A spokeswoman for Purcell, a Republican, told CNN Tuesday they were cooperating with the federal government. \u201cWe are fully cooperating with the Department of Justice. And we are in the process of gathering all of the information that they have asked for,\u201d Elizabeth Bartholomew said. But Bartholomew said any suggestion that Purcell intentionally suppressed voters is false. \u201cHelen\u2019s career has been focused on trying to make voting easier and more accessible. There was absolutely no way she tried to make it harder for voters to vote or to suppress anyone from voting,\u201d she said. \u201cAt the end of the day, it was just a huge miscalculation and a mistake. And we\u2019re moving forward and making changes to make sure that that never happens again.\u201d Phoenix Mayor Greg Stanton, a Democrat, as well as Arizona Democratic Rep. Ruben Gallego and other lawmakers, called for investigations into race- and class-based voter suppression into Arizona\u2019s largest county soon after the primary, which was held on March 22. RELATED: Arizona Democrats call for probe into voter suppression claims Maricopa County had 60 polling stations. There were at least 200 polling stations in that jurisdiction in 2012, but Republican officials said they decreased the number to save money. Even after waiting in line for hours, some people were not allowed to vote. At least 20 Democratic voters contacted the Arizona Democratic Party to say that when they arrived at the polls, they were told that they were registered as independents and therefore unable to vote in the closed primary. Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey, a Republican, said the situation was \u201cunacceptable.\u201d \u201cIf people want to take the time to vote they should be able to, and their vote should be counted,\u201d he tweeted the day after the primary, calling on election officials to figure out what went wrong. Purcell initially defended the closings, telling Fox 10 Phoenix that voters could have voted via early ballots rather than risking waiting in line. But she later took \u201cfull responsibility for what happened\u201d at polling stations while speaking at a Maricopa County Board of Supervisors meeting. Historically, the Department of Justice had to approve any changes in voting procedure in Arizona because of the state\u2019s history of discrimination against minorities in voting. But a Supreme Court decision in 2013 allowed Arizona to begin making changes without federal oversight. Leaders said if federal scrutiny had been required before making changes, Tuesday\u2019s situation would have never happened. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who lost Arizona to Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton, called the situation \u201ca disgrace\u201d soon after the primary. \u201cIn the United States of America, democracy is the foundation of our way of life,\u201d the Democratic presidential hopeful previously said. \u201cAnd what happened in Arizona is a disgrace. I hope that every state in this country learns from that and learns how to put together a proper election where people can come in and vote in a timely manner and go back to work.\u201d",

            "article_content": "It's voting season and -- yet again -- Florida is poised to play a pivotal role in a presidential election For Republicans, this state will help determine whether the party's primary season remains competitive It\u2019s voting season and \u2013 yet again \u2013 Florida is poised to play a pivotal role in a presidential election. For Republicans, this state will help determine whether the party\u2019s primary season remains competitive, or if real estate mogul Donald Trump takes another step toward becoming their nominee. The stakes are especially high for Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, who has pinned his hopes on winning here Tuesday. Florida is a sprawling, diverse swing state with multiple voting blocs and ethnicities, which is part of what makes it so unpredictable in politics. With the presidential race in full swing here, two constituencies in particular help show just how different Florida voters can be: The Cubans, a vocal voting bloc of immigrant exiles and the Florida crackers, families who have lived here for generations. Both lean Republican, but each community represents two very different types of Florida voters. Big Marco in Little Havana As a Cuban-American born in Miami, Rubio\u2019s rise as a state legislator and U.S. senator is inextricably tied to his roots in South Florida\u2019s community of exiles who have fled Fidel Castro\u2019s regime. \u201cHe grew up in this community. He has relationships with so many different parts in it. He understands it because he lives in so many experiences just like us,\u201d said Armando Ibarra, a Rubio supporter whose parents were also Cuban exiles. \u201cHe really speaks to the values I grew up with in a way no other candidate does.\u201d The senator\u2019s backers here say they are proud that one of their own has risen to such heights. (Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, too, is the son of a Cuban-born immigrant, although his father put down roots in Texas, not Florida.) With Rubio\u2019s political future hanging in the balance of Tuesday\u2019s primary election, politics is the talk of the community. That passion was on display here on a recent afternoon in Maximo Gomez Park in Little Havana, where aging exiles have gathered for years to play dominos and gossip. On this day, loud discussions of the looming election bounced through the air above the sound of noisy dominoes shuffling across tables and live Cuban music playing on a nearby street. \u201cMarco Rubio is the son of a Cuban immigrant. He\u2019s conservative,\u201d said Porfidio Sanchez, speaking in Spanish, who paused from his game to give his analysis of the election. \u201cAs a Cuban, that I am, I should vote for a son of my countryman so he can be the president of the United States.\u201d \u201cMarco Rubio is the best!\u201d a woman across the table shouted, also in Spanish. \u201cHillary Clinton!\u201d another nearby voice shouted. \u201cClinton and Trump, the two of them are good for nothing!\u201d the woman responded. Rubio may be popular among Republicans in Miami, but in order for him to win on Tuesday, he must dominate statewide. Florida polls of Republican voters continue to show Trump leading Rubio. And in the wide stretches of Florida land beyond Miami-Dade country, he\u2019s not nearly as popular. Cracker country Quick! List a few things that come to mind when you think about Florida. Disney, beaches, oranges \u2013 and possibly an unbelievable news story involving a \u201cFlorida man,\u201d a reptile and some dynamite \u2013 are the usual associations. But throughout parts of central and northern regions of the state, you\u2019ll find a quieter, less flashy breed of Floridian: They are the original American cowboys and cowgirls whose families have been here for hundreds of years. These are the proud Florida crackers. The crackers, descendants of ranchers that date back as far as the sixteenth century, derive their nickname from the sound of a whip they use to drive cattle across the state and out of Florida\u2019s thick underbrush. While out-of-state politicians often steer clear of the term, former President Bill Clinton used it correctly before campaigning in Florida for then-candidate Barack Obama in 2008 when he said the campaign had sent him to \u201chustle up\u201d the \u201ccracker vote.\u201d Some clueless media outlets reported at the time that Clinton had used a racial slur, but as any good Floridian will tell you, the name predates the modern pejorative use of the word to describe white people. And here, they\u2019re downright proud of it. \u201cPeople don\u2019t realize in Florida that we\u2019re the first cowboys in the United States. We\u2019ve been doing cattle business for 500 years here in Florida,\u201d said Todd Clemons, president of the Okeechobee Cattleman\u2019s Association. \u201cWhen everything else in the world is changing, our way of life is still the same. And it\u2019s a good feeling.\u201d It is in communities like this that candidates like Trump and Cruz will be making their biggest dents against Rubio. The crackers who live in this part of the state, the region surrounding Lake Okeechobee, are generally conservative. But said they they\u2019re turned off by the negative tone of the presidential election. \u201cWe\u2019re Republicans and everything, but I don\u2019t think Donald Trump\u2019s going to do the part,\u201d said James Greeson, a bronco rider from Okeechobee who said he supports Cruz. \u201cI think he has good intentions, but he\u2019s power hungry.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t like him. He\u2019s too dang smart aleck-y,\u201d said Jack Sutton, who has lived in Okeechobee for his entire life. One of the best-known crackers in this part of the state is Iris Wall, an 86-year-old rancher who still keeps watch of her cattle from her ranch near Indiantown. Tough and straight-talking, Wall said she has struggled with choosing a candidate to mark down on her ballot Tuesday. \u201cI liked Rubio pretty good at first, but when he got to doing what they told him to, I got enough of him,\u201d Wall said as she drove around her ranch in her pick-up. \u201cAt least (Trump\u2019s) got guts enough to say what he thinks. That\u2019s something. Although sometimes it\u2019s stupid, it\u2019s still something. This is the first year I\u2019ve had a hard, hard time.\u201d But she does know one thing: \u201cI can tell you this right now \u2013 and it may not make you like me worth a flip but I don\u2019t care \u2013 I\u2019m not voting for Hillary Clinton, I\u2019ll tell you that. And I\u2019m not going to vote for the other old man neither.\u201d",

            "article_content": "\"Violence is never the answer. Violence only begets more violence,\" Priebus said \"Leaders and activists in both parties bear a responsibility to ensure that the discourse we engage in promotes the best of America,\" he said A day after fights and protests forced Republican front-runner Donald Trump to cancel a Chicago rally, the Republican National Committee\u2019s chairman released a statement calling for Americans to be respectful of each others\u2019 views. \u201cWhile I hope all Americans exercise their First Amendment rights, we must do so in a manner that is respectful of our fellow Americans. While we have differences, our right to free speech should be just that: speech,\u201d Reince Priebus said Saturday. \u201cViolence is never the answer. Violence only begets more violence.\u201d \u201cAs we go further along in this election cycle, I ask those on my side of the political spectrum and those on the left to engage actively in the political process in a manner that continues to make our democracy the envy of the rest of the world,\u201d he continued. \u201cLeaders and activists in both parties bear a responsibility to ensure that the discourse we engage in promotes the best of America.\u201d Priebus said the world will be watching how Americans behave this election. \u201cThe stakes for the election this November are high. The eyes of the world will look upon America closely to see how we conduct ourselves,\u201d he said. Even before Friday\u2019s unrest \u2013 which included physical altercations between Trump supporters and protesters, as well as confrontations on the streets outside the arena where the rally was to be held \u2013 protests and racial tensions have been escalating at Trump rallies. On Thursday, a man attending a Trump rally this week was charged with assault after he allegedly sucker-punched a black protester being led out of a Trump event. Last fall, Trump said a Black Lives Matter protester maybe \u201cshould have been roughed up.\u201d And despite an announcement at the start of his rallies urging supporters not to be violent toward protesters, Trump in February urged his supporters to \u201cknock the crap out of\u201d anybody \u201cgetting ready to throw a tomato\u201d and vowed to pay for their legal fees should they face charges. \u201cKnock the crap out of them, would you? Seriously. OK? Just knock the hell \u2013 I promise you, I will pay for the legal fees. I promise, I promise,\u201d Trump said. And Trump also said he personally wanted to punch a protester \u201cin the face\u201d during a rally in February. But at CNN\u2019s Republican debate on Thursday, Trump insisted that he did not support violence at his events. \u201cI certainly do not condone that at all,\u201d Trump said, adding, \u201cWe have some protesters who are bad dudes. They have done bad things.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Clinton unloads new attacks on Sanders over his opposition to the auto bailout and the Export-Import bank Sanders portrays Clinton as an opponent straight out of Wall Street central casting Both call for the ouster of Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder, a Republican It was no Republican debate \u2013 nobody talked about the size of their hands or made up demeaning nicknames \u2013 but Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders were ready for action Sunday night. Personal frustration peeked through as Clinton unloaded new attacks on Sanders over his opposition to the auto bailout and Sanders portrayed Clinton as a candidate straight out of Wall Street central casting. Clinton, Sanders talk over each other in debate clash Sunday was also \u201990s night, as the candidates essentially re-litigated major political battles of the era \u2013 including NAFTA, the assault weapons ban and crime bill \u2013 through modern eyes. The debate came two days before Michigan\u2019s primary \u2013 a key test of whether Sanders can expand his appeal to a broader and more diverse electorate \u2013 and was shaped by the concerns of voters in this city that is still struggling with a water crisis for which local, state and federal officials share the blame. Here are five takeaways from Sunday\u2019s debate: Sanders waved, shouted, eye-rolled, baited and goaded his way through the debate. Opinion: Democratic debate in Flint: Clinton, Sanders fight to move needle Clinton laid into his opposition to the auto industry bailout. That measure was part of a broader rescue of the financial industry, a point Sanders was only too happy to make by saying: \u201cIf you are talking about the Wall Street bailout, where some of your friends destroyed the economy \u2014\u201d Clinton interrupted: \u201cYou know\u2026\u201d Sanders shot back: \u201cExcuse me, I\u2019m talking.\u201d And then Clinton said: \u201cIf you\u2019re going to talk, tell the whole story.\u201d Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders love the '90s Sanders railed against the bailout, saying that he decided to \u201clet the billionaires themselves bail out Wall Street \u2013 it shouldn\u2019t be the middle class\u201d \u2013 when Clinton tried to interject again. \u201cCould I finish? You\u2019ll have your turn,\u201d he said. He showed his frustration with Clinton again later, saying: \u201cCan I finish, please? All right?\u201d The exchange demonstrated a new level of comfort with the hand-to-hand combat of presidential campaigns. But it was also a risky move, making him sound potentially patronizing or dismissive of a candidate who could become the first female president. This from a candidate who entered the race bragging about never running a negative ad. Sanders might keep their disputes focused on differences of policy \u2013 but at times Sunday night, it looked and sounded personal. When Clinton was asked about fracking, she launched into a nuanced answer that gave credence to localities, state governments, and more. Her bottom line: There wouldn\u2019t be many places where it would be OK under her. Sanders had a much simpler answer. \u201cNo,\u201d he said. He doesn\u2019t support it. And he said he doesn\u2019t care about all the Democratic governors who support it. This, in a nutshell, is the difference between them. She has nuanced positions that look at the breadth of opinion across the country. She\u2019s also keenly aware of the limitations of government, and strains to keep her positions within those limits \u2013 part of what she calls her \u201cresponsibility gene.\u201d Sanders has definitive positions that take a look at his ideology. That\u2019s the Democrat\u2019s choice: nuance or no nuance. This same difference showed up when the two delved into the Flint water crisis at the debate\u2019s outset. Clinton, Sanders rip Michigan over Flint water crisis Clinton\u2019s big move on stage \u2013 her news-making comment at the debate\u2019s outset \u2013 was one she\u2019d resisted for months, arguing it was simplistic. But she went for it Sunday night, saying she agrees with Sanders in saying Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder needs to go. \u201cI agree the governor should resign or be recalled,\u201d she said. But Sanders got bigger applause when he proposed putting an end to the city\u2019s water bills, and refunding what residents there have paid in recent years. \u201cFirst thing you do is say, people are not paying a water bill for poison water. And that is retroactive,\u201d he said. Clinton saw Sanders\u2019 punches over trade deals coming from miles away.  That\u2019s particularly true for the North American Free Trade Agreement, implemented under Bill Clinton. So she readied an attack that Sanders didn\u2019t seem prepared for, going at the Vermont senator for opposing the auto bailout. Clinton and Sanders battle over auto industry bailout \u201cThe money was there and had to be released in order to save the auto industry and 4 million jobs and to begin the restructuring,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cI voted to save the auto industry. He voted against the money that ended up saving the auto industry. I think that is a pretty big difference.\u201d Then, she ticked off a list of states where she thinks that vote will hurt Sanders. \u201cGiven the terrible pressures that the auto industry was under and that the middle class of this state and Ohio and Indiana and Illinois and Wisconsin and Missouri and other places in the Midwest were facing, I think it was the right decision to heed what President-elect Obama asked us to do,\u201d she said. \u201cYou were either for saving the auto industry or against it. I voted to save the auto industry and I\u2019m very glad that I did.\u201d The damage was done: When Clinton dropped the auto bailout bomb, the audience audibly ooooohed, highlighting the potency of that argument in the home of the U.S. auto industry. Sanders clearly learned lessons from earlier debates. He was careful not to suggest President Barack Obama hasn\u2019t done enough \u2013 on anything \u2013 and instead said the country needs to build on Obama\u2019s progress. Sanders: White people don't know life in a ghetto His criticism that Clinton is pandering to black voters by cozying up to Obama was gone entirely.  Sanders was commanding in discussing the Flint water crisis, taking Clinton\u2019s push for a debate in the city and turning it into his strong suit. He also took back ground on gun violence, saying of the shootings at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut, \u201cYou\u2019re not the only person whose heart was broken.\u201d But he had his tone-deaf moments, sparking outrage on social media when he seemed to suggest that black people grow up poor and in ghettos and white people do not \u2013 a particular eye-raiser because he\u2019d been asked about his racial blind spots. \u201cWhen you\u2019re white, you don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like to be living in a ghetto, you don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like to be poor,\u201d Sanders said. For Sanders, this is the central challenge facing his campaign. Clinton blew him out across the South among African-Americans, and Sanders can\u2019t withstand her doing so again in big, Midwestern states. Michigan\u2019s March 8 primary will be a key test of whether Sanders can win with a more diverse electorate. The following week \u2013 when Ohio, Illinois, Missouri, Florida and North Carolina vote \u2013 will be his moment of truth. Near the end of the debate, Sanders also cracked a joke about boosting funding for mental health, saying that \u201cwhen you watch these Republican debates, you know why we need to invest in mental health.\u201d It was the right target (Republicans) and the right audience (liberals) \u2013 but perhaps the wrong topic, as he again risked appearing insensitive. The debate was a strong sign that both candidates still see room to gain or lose ground among liberal voters. They spent so much time jockeying to get to each other\u2019s left that there was virtually no talk of Republicans at all. Clinton and Sanders defended government spending and intervention, teachers\u2019 unions, gun control, clean energy programs and efforts to fight climate change. They talked about a beefed-up role for the Environmental Protection Agency. There was no talk about foreign policy, the deficit, entitlements \u2013 subjects always front-and-center at Republican debates. This is why Vice President Joe Biden didn\u2019t run for president: winning over the Democratic electorate is a sprint to the left. It\u2019s why Trump\u2019s strength among white, working-class men causes some Democrats to fret. It\u2019s a clear sign that the Sanders camp doesn\u2019t see the Democratic nominating contest ending anytime soon, with liberal bastions like New York (which votes in April) and California (June) available as opportunities to rack up lots of delegates. Increasingly, Clinton is eyeing the general election on the campaign trail \u2013 axing her usual shots at Sanders from her stump speech, focusing on the economy and laying into Republican front-runner Donald Trump. That wasn\u2019t apparent Sunday night.",

            "article_content": "Candidates spar over Wall Street, auto bailouts, gun violence and more Clinton holds delegate lead in Democratic primary battle Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders angrily clashed over auto industry bailouts, guns, political battles from the 1990s and ties to Wall Street on Sunday, as underlying tensions in the Democratic presidential race burst into the open at an impassioned CNN debate in Flint, Michigan. 5 takeaways from the Democratic debate The forum quickly turned into a heated philosophical argument about an economy that Sanders said is weighted against the middle and working classes and is abetted, he said, by close ties between politicians, such as Clinton, and Wall Street financiers. Sanders accused Clinton of supporting \u201cdisastrous\u201d trade policies that contributed to corporate America\u2019s decision to move manufacturing from cities like Flint to low-wage economies in Central America and Asia. But she in turn said that Sanders had refused to vote for a bailout for the auto industry that was included in the outgoing Bush administration\u2019s attempts to stave off the financial crisis. Flint: It\u2019s not just about the water \u201cIf everybody had voted the way he did, I believe the auto industry would have collapsed, taking 4 million jobs with it,\u201d Clinton said. ICYMI: Listen in to CNN's #DemDebate in Flint, Michigan https://t.co/J6E8LaFmDl pic.twitter.com/u2E2se5UZi Clinton also pressed Sanders on guns and accused him of being too close to the National Rifle Association. \u201cYou talk about corporate greed. The gun manufacturers sell guns to make as much money as they can make,\u201d Clinton said. Where is Bernie Sanders\u2019 gun control plan? Sanders replied by responding that Clinton\u2019s arguments, effectively,  would amount to a ban on the manufacture of guns. At one point, both candidates talked over one another in their determination to  make their points about the economy. \u201cExcuse me, I am talking,\u201d Sanders said. Sanders repeatedly knocked Clinton for her ties to the finance industry and demanded that she release transcripts of her paid speeches to Wall Street firms. Clinton said she will do so when other candidates, including Republicans, agree to do the same. While the exchanges were intense and revealed clear schisms between Clinton and Sanders, they were largely confined to policy differences, and lacked the personal \u2013 and even vulgar \u2013 tone that  characterized the last two Republican debates. Both candidates billed themselves as the best possible person to take on the Republicans, particularly Donald Trump, in a general election. Clinton slammed what she said was the \u201cbigotry, bullying and bluster\u201d of the GOP front-runner, while her rival pointed to polls indicating he was more likely to beat the billionaire. Clinton and Sanders opened the debate agreeing on one point: that Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder should step down over his response to the toxic water crisis in Flint. 1 day in Flint, 151 bottles of water Sanders accused Synder of \u201cdereliction of duty\u201d while Clinton said the governor should \u201cresign or be recalled\u201d \u2013 a comment that represented a new position for the former secretary of state. Snyder tweeted in his own defense during the debate. \u201cI\u2019m taking responsibility as our value system says we should. My track record is getting things done, and I want to get this done,\u201d he wrote on Twitter. Both candidates expressed alarm over the water crisis that erupted in Flint when government officials switched the city\u2019s water source temporarily in April 2014 from the Great Lakes to the Flint River to cut costs. Pollution from the highly corrosive river water then ate into the city\u2019s water system, causing lead to leach into the water supply. \u201cIt\u2019s raining lead in Flint,\u201d Clinton said. Sanders recalled his visit to the city last month and said, \u201cWhat I heard and what I saw literally shattered me.\u201d The candidates offered candid assessments of race in America. Clinton, when asked what racial blind spots she had, admitted that it was impossible for her to share the experience of many African-Americans, but she said she tried to understand the issues the community faces. \u201cI think (by) being a white person in the United States of America, I know that I have never had the experience that so many people, the people in this audience have had,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I think it\u2019s incumbent upon me, and what I have been trying to talk about during this campaign, is to urge white people to think about what it is like to have \u2018the talk\u2019 with your kids, scared that your sons or daughters, even, could get in trouble for no good reason whatsoever.\u201d Clinton's new pitch to African-American voters Sanders hit an awkward note as he sought to empathize with discrimination facing African-Americans, a demographic he has struggled to win in several primary contests. \u201cWhen you\u2019re white, you don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like to be living in a ghetto,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cYou don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like to be poor. You don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like to be hassled when you walk down the street or you get dragged out of a car.\u201d The debate in Flint came a day after Sanders pulled off morale-boosting Super Saturday victories in Kansas and Nebraska, doubling up on Clinton, who won the Louisiana primary on Saturday. During the debate, CNN projected that Sanders would win the Maine Democratic caucuses. But Clinton\u2019s victory in Louisiana, which had the most delegates on offer this weekend, means that her lead in the presidential race of about 200 pledged delegates, remains essentially the same. Michigan holds its primary on Tuesday. Bernie Sanders' big test in Michigan The Democratic campaign is unfolding amid themes of race, economic opportunity and the problems afflicting blue-collar workers that are crystallized in the city of Flint in an age of globalization. More coverage on the water crisis in Flint, Michigan Residents say that even though the water supply has now been switched back to Lake Huron, the damage done to piping in their homes and in the water infrastructure remains severe and they are forced to drink bottled water. Michigan officials are investigating the extent to which lead poisoning has harmed the residents, including children, amid reports of severe rashes, developmental issues and other problems consistent with lead poisoning. The debate offered members of the audience directly affected by some of the local issues a chance to question the candidates. LeeAnne Walters, one of the first people to alert authorities about the Flint water crisis after her children developed health problems, asked the candidates to promise that if they were elected president, they would require the removal of all lead service lines from public water systems in the United States. Gene Kopf, father of 14-year-old Abigail Kopf, who was shot and badly injured in a rampage in Kalamazoo, posed a question about gun control. Flint\u2019s problems are not limited to its water crisis. The city has long been a symbol of economic blight and the human implications of the decline of large-scale industrial manufacturing following the loss of its GM car manufacturing plant. More than 41% of Flint\u2019s residents live below the poverty level, according to the U.S. Census. When asked about the flight of blue-collar jobs from cities such as Flint, Clinton said she would \u201cstop this kind of jobs exporting.\u201d But Sanders hit back: \u201cI am very glad \u2026 that Secretary Clinton has discovered religion on this issue.\u201d",

            "article_content": "A version of this article was originally published in 2016. Explore America\u2019s most dramatic presidential elections with CNN Original Series \u201cRace for the White House,\u201d returning Sunday at 10 p.m. ET. When the president of the United States does something \u2013 even a small thing \u2013 people tend to notice. Franklin Roosevelt in 1943 was the first sitting president to fly on an airplane. And, while Barack Obama is best known for becoming the country\u2019s first African-American president, in 2014 he also became the first commander in chief to write a line of computer code, typing: moveForward(100);. Here are five other presidential firsts. See if you know them: Maybe a cross-Atlantic journey by President John Adams or George Washington? A train ride up to Canada by Andrew Jackson or Ulysses S. Grant in the 19th century? Nope. It wasn\u2019t until the turn of the 20th century that any American president set foot outside the United States during office. In 1906, Theodore Roosevelt boarded the USS Louisiana and steamed to Panama to inspect construction of the Panama Canal. Fast-forward 111 years, when President Donald Trump visited more than a dozen countries during his first year in office. Plenty of American vice presidents got the top job after a president\u2019s death or resignation, but how many became vice president and president without earning a single vote at the ballot box? When Vice President Spiro Agnew resigned in a tax evasion scandal in 1973, President Richard Nixon appointed Rep. Gerald Ford, R-Michigan, as Agnew\u2019s replacement. A year later, under political pressure by the Watergate scandal, Nixon resigned, making Ford the only commander in chief ever to be president and vice president without ever being elected to office. Ford lost his bid to remain in the White House to Jimmy Carter in 1976. There\u2019s been so much buzz in recent years around the American presidency and where a candidate, or his parents, were born that it\u2019s spawned the term \u201cbirther movement.\u201d Early American presidents had no choice but to be born as foreign citizens \u2013 the United States wasn\u2019t yet a country when they were born. So who was the first American president to actually be a US citizen? That title goes to Martin Van Buren, the country\u2019s eighth president. Born in Kinderhook, New York, on December 5, 1782, Van Buren rose to become a New York governor, US secretary of state and vice president before his election to the White House. All previous presidents had been born as colonists, making them citizens of Great Britain. Did you guess Franklin D. Roosevelt? Sorry, that\u2019s wrong. While FDR is the only US president to serve more than two presidential terms (something that\u2019s no longer allowed, thanks to the 22nd Amendment), he served all four of his terms back to back. You have to rewind to the 19th century in the years after the Civil War to find the only US president who moved out of the White House, only to return again in a few years. Former New York Gov. Grover Cleveland served as president No. 22 and No. 24 \u2013 the only commander in chief to serve two nonconsecutive terms. Commanding the airwaves of major television networks is still a powerful way for a POTUS to share important messages with the American people \u2013 yet the presidential news conference actually started decades before TVs became a household item in the 1950s and 1960s. In March 1913, Woodrow Wilson became the first US leader to hold a presidential news conference. But make no mistake: These were not the free-wheeling, nonscripted, live question-and-answer sessions that we are accustomed to today. Wilson and the next five US presidents held off-the-record news conferences, meaning they could amend anything they said to the media. And they certainly weren\u2019t broadcast live, even over the radio. It wasn\u2019t until January 1955 that President Dwight Eisenhower held the first televised news conference, ushering in the era of on-the-record presidential press briefings. John F. Kennedy held the first live televised news conference in 1961. It\u2019s no surprise that once presidential news conferences became on the record in the Eisenhower administration, the frequency dropped significantly.",

            "article_content": "Clinton's firewall not only held, but her blowout win gives her new momentum into Super Tuesday 84% of African-American voters went for Clinton Hillary Clinton saw Bernie Sanders\u2019 New Hampshire blowout and raised him one in South Carolina. Riding the strength of her support among African-Americans to a resounding victory in the Palmetto State, Clinton seized the momentum in the Democratic presidential race \u2013 winning her third of four early-state contests just three days before the race goes national on Super Tuesday. Here are five takeaways from South Carolina\u2019s Democratic primary: It was a bumpy ride through the early states \u2013 but Clinton\u2019s firewall of minority support held, helping her seal a close contest in Nevada and then turn South Carolina into her first dominant win of the 2016 race. Headed into Super Tuesday, the confidence Clinton\u2019s campaign had after October and November is back. \u201cTomorrow, this campaign goes national,\u201d Clinton said in her victory speech. \u201cWe are going to compete for every vote in every state. We are not taking anything and we are not taking anyone for granted.\u201d The South Carolina win is especially important because of what it means for the 11 Democratic contests that are on tap for Tuesday. Clinton is eyeing six Southern states with heavy minority populations as a way to lock in a clear delegate advantage. She\u2019s hoping for big wins in Texas, Georgia, Virginia, Tennessee, Alabama and Arkansas. Sanders, meanwhile, has his home state of Vermont locked in, and he\u2019s hoping for wins in Colorado, Minnesota, Massachusetts and Oklahoma. Clinton\u2019s South Carolina blowout effectively guarantees that Sanders will have to scrap for those states \u2013 and would struggle to expand his playing field, leaving Clinton\u2019s six targets intact. South Carolina\u2019s electorate climbed from 55% African-American in 2008 to 62% in 2016. And the vast majority of those voters \u2013 84% \u2013 backed Clinton, according to exit polls. The former secretary of state isn\u2019t messing around in courting black voters: She had Morgan Freeman narrate campaign ads. She had strong allies like South Carolina Democratic Rep. Jim Clyburn on her side. She has leaned hard into her alliance with the White House, saying Saturday night she wants to \u201cbuild on the record and accomplishments of President Obama.\u201d She has contrasted sharply with Sanders on issues like gun control and portrayed him as a one-note candidate concerned only about income inequality. To underscore her support on issues important to African-Americans, Clinton highlighted the role that five mothers of black victims of gun violence who campaigned alongside her in South Carolina. \u201cThey all lost children, which is almost unimaginable. Yet they have not been broken or embittered. Instead, they have channeled their sorrow into a strategy and their mourning into a movement,\u201d she said. Two more important exit poll findings: Most voters say race relations haven\u2019t improved in recent years \u2013 and very few Democratic voters trust Sanders more than Clinton on race-related issues. It\u2019s not like Sanders woke up Saturday morning expecting a win. He practically conceded the state on the eve of the Nevada contest by declaring it was \u201con to Super Tuesday.\u201d He spent the day in Texas and Minnesota instead. He didn\u2019t even plan a speech after the results were announced. But perception isn\u2019t quite reality: Sanders\u2019 investment in South Carolina reveals a campaign that was hopeful his message of tackling economic inequality and reforming the criminal justice system would both make the state competitive and show he could win minority voters in other Democratic primaries. He invested $2 million in advertisements, some featuring Spike Lee. His campaign had nearly 200 staffers in the state. And he opened 11 South Carolina offices. The results revealed two big problems for Sanders. One is that he hasn\u2019t made the inroads he\u2019d hoped for among African-American voters. Almost as significantly, he couldn\u2019t turn out the young voters age 18-29 who are the single strongest constituency of his campaign. Those voters made up just 13% of South Carolina\u2019s electorate, according to early exit polls, after comprising about one-in-five in other early-voting states. Disinterest among young voters is a particularly troubling sign. Sanders, however, kept the race close among white voters, losing just 53% to 47%. And he won two in five voters age 44 and under \u2013 not good, but better than the one in five he won age 45 and older. It\u2019s a signal he can still rack up large shares of delegates in whiter northern states \u2013 and states where independents can participate in the Democratic contest, allowing him to bring new voters into the electorate. Speaking in Minnesota Saturday night, he tried to energize his supporters: \u201cFootball is a spectator sport. Democracy is not a spectator sport. Every person in this room is extremely powerful if you choose to use your power.\u201d Clinton even Sanders out among white voters. While Sanders won white men 56% to 44%, Clinton won white women 60% to 40%. She won whites overall, 54% to 46% \u2013 a much smaller margin than her overall victory, but still significant, since Sanders typically outperforms Clinton with white voters. Beyond the Democratic primary, Trump, like Sanders, dominates among white men. Clinton won\u2019t need to win those voters to win the election. But she can\u2019t be blown out, either. While Clinton is bashing Trump on the campaign trail, she won\u2019t be able to start reaching out to moderate voters any time soon, with Sanders\u2019 strength among liberals constantly pulling Clinton leftward on policy. \u201cWe don\u2019t need to make America great again \u2013 America has never stopped being great,\u201d Clinton said, taking a shot at Trump. \u201cBut we do need to make America whole again. Instead of building walls, we need to be tearing down barriers. We need to show by everything we do that we really are in this together.\u201d There was good news for Clinton, whose numbers on trust and credibility have lagged far behind Sanders in earlier contests. In South Carolina, 74% of primary voters said they consider Clinton honest and trustworthy \u2013 better than Sanders\u2019 63%. Asked who is honest and trustworthy, 28% of primary voters said only Clinton. Another 17% said only Sanders. And 46% said both. It was just eight years ago that Bill Clinton turned into a toxic asset. The most naturally gifted politician of his generation couldn\u2019t keep it from getting personal in South Carolina, when he opened racial fault lines in an effort to diminish Barack Obama\u2019s threat to his wife\u2019s presidential bid. Obama won the state by 28 points. All appears to be forgiven. Bill Clinton campaigned across the state for his wife, allowing the Clinton campaign to capitalize on the sort of surrogate Sanders could never possibly match. It was the latest sign that, despite his low-key role in the campaign thus far, the former President is finding a way to shed the baggage of his at-times damaging 2008 role and prove he remains a useful campaign asset. Much of it has to do with Obama. Bill Clinton\u2019s \u201cexplainer-in-chief\u201d 2012 Democratic National Convention healed most wounds that remained, and Hillary Clinton sealed the deal by positioning herself as the logical heir to Obama\u2019s policies\u2013 with 70% of those who voted Saturday saying they want the next president to continue those policies. Perhaps the best evidence that all is forgiven: In 2008, Clyburn, who\u2019d endorsed Obama, was furious after Bill Clinton had called him a \u201cbastard\u201d in a late-night, post-primary phone call that Clyburn detailed in his memoir. On Saturday night, Hillary Clinton was introduced in South Carolina for her victory speech by Clyburn \u2013 who was smiling and dancing on stage.",

            "article_content": "The results of the Nevada entrance poll Saturday showed Latino voters broke for Bernie Sanders over Hillary Clinton by an 8-point margin Since 2004, some have argued that the exit poll often underestimates the Democratic share of the Latino vote Younger Latinos broke sharply for Sanders over Clinton in this entrance poll, while Latino voters over age 30 broke in Clinton's favor by about a 2-to-1 margin A data-driven controversy has erupted over a finding in the entrance poll of Nevada\u2019s Democratic caucusgoers Saturday, with the results of the poll among Latinos seemingly at odds with widely held expectations that the group was a strong one for Hillary Clinton. The results of the Nevada entrance poll Saturday showed black voters squarely in Clinton\u2019s corner, as expected, while Latino voters broke for Sanders over Clinton by an 8-point margin, just outside the margin of sampling error for the group. The latter finding prompted doubts in some corners, including from the Clinton campaign. Their criticisms mostly rest on an analysis of the vote by precinct, conducted by the New York Times. Looking at the vote by precinct in locations with a higher concentration of Hispanic voters, the analysis suggested Clinton won more county delegates in those precincts than those in other locations. With the slate of upcoming primary and caucus states shifting from nearly all-white Iowa and New Hampshire to a more diverse batch of states including Nevada, South Carolina and many of the states set to vote on March 1, whether the racial and ethnic minorities in those states would prove a firewall for Clinton\u2019s campaign against Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders has been a sharp focus for both campaigns. Nightcap: Now that Jeb\u2019s gone, where is his money going? | Sign up The preferences of Latino voters as reported in exit and entrance polling has been a source of controversy for more than a decade, since a 2004 national exit poll finding estimated that Republican President George W. Bush captured 44% of the Latino vote in his re-election bid. Since that time, some have argued that the exit poll often underestimates the Democratic share of the Latino vote, or that it misrepresents the preferences of Latinos more generally, as is the argument here. RELATED: Sanders brushes off Nevada loss Those arguments often rest on comparisons to data collected in telephone polling of Latinos that are either sampled from areas with a high concentration of Hispanic residents, or from lists of Latino voters identified by their Hispanic surname. In both instances, these surveys miss a substantial share of the Hispanic population, either by not drawing samples from places where Latinos are not heavily concentrated, or by ignoring those who do not have a Hispanic surname, and that\u2019s on top of the general difficulty of identifying likely voters in telephone surveys. In this case, the comparison is to county delegate counts in precincts that appear to represent heavily Hispanic areas, again based on a surname analysis. That analysis assumes proportional turnout by race within any given precinct, and perhaps more importantly, assumes that once caucusgoers arrived, the vote along racial and ethnic lines for those Latinos who voted in heavily Hispanic precincts was about the same as that seen in Hispanics voting in other precinct locations around the state, something that can\u2019t be proven by either entrance polls or this style of precinct-level analysis. Still, exit and entrance polls have their own methodological challenges when measuring the vote among subgroups of the population, such as Latinos, that are not evenly spread throughout a state. A sample of precincts that has three heavily Hispanic precincts in one election year and only one in the following year could suggest a drop in turnout among Hispanics, for example, but that finding would be better chalked up to sampling error than any real change in the electorate. But there are reasons to believe that the entrance poll findings reflect a race among Latinos that is actually tighter than was broadly expected before this first contest featuring a substantial minority population, and the key is age. RELATED: 8 takeaways from South Carolina and Nevada Latino voters in Nevada are generally younger than whites or blacks in the state, and as we\u2019ve seen in both national polls and exit polls so far, younger voters are perhaps more apt to back Sanders than any other group in the Democratic electorate. According to the Census Bureau, the median age of all Latinos in Nevada is 26 years old, compared with a median age of 44 for whites and 33 for blacks. And looking at past votes in the state, the general election exit poll there in 2012 found that 34% of Latino voters were under age 30 compared with 9% of whites and 27% of blacks. In Saturday\u2019s entrance poll, 38% of Latinos who showed up to caucus were under age 30, similar to the share in the 2012 presidential election exit poll, but almost double the share of Latino caucusgoers who were under age 30 in 2008, when Clinton narrowly carried the group with 20% support, just ahead of John Edwards and Barack Obama. In Saturday\u2019s data, 14% of blacks and 12% of whites were under age 30. Those younger Latinos broke sharply for Sanders over Clinton in this entrance poll, while Latino voters over age 30 broke in Clinton\u2019s favor by about a 2-to-1 margin. The real wildcard is whether that sharp age divide combined with heavier turnout among younger Latinos carries over into any other states where Latino voters make up a significant share of the population, and that assessment will likely have to wait until after South Carolina\u2019s Democrats go to the polls. Looking ahead to the Democratic side of South Carolina\u2019s primaries, polling conducted mostly last week has found Clinton holding a broad lead over Sanders in the run-up to that contest, set to be held Saturday. A new CNN Poll of Polls covering live-interviewer telephone surveys conducted between February 10 and 17 finds Clinton averages 57% support while Sanders holds 32%. Most of the polling conducted in South Carolina shows Clinton\u2019s candidacy boosted by strong support among black voters, who are expected to make up a majority of Saturday\u2019s primary voters. It may be the first opportunity to look in-depth at the demographic divides among black voters, to see whether Sanders\u2019 appeal to young voters extends to African Americans in their 20s. Another element to watch for Saturday that could boost Clinton\u2019s numbers: Turnout. Every Democratic contest held so far has seen turnout drop compared with 2008 levels, while on the Republican side, turnout has climbed. South Carolina is the first state with a truly open primary. There is no party registration, so any voter can choose to participate in either party\u2019s event, but they can only choose one. With the Republican primary having drawn record turnout, it\u2019s possible the numbers participating on the Democratic side will be lower and more concentrated among the party\u2019s faithful. Those who consider themselves Democrats have been more firmly in Clinton\u2019s corner across contests this year, and the CNN/ORC Poll in South Carolina showed Clinton\u2019s margin even larger among self-identified Democrats. For the Nevada Republican caucuses, little methodologically-sound polling has been conducted, but a CNN/ORC Poll conducted before the South Carolina primary suggested Donald Trump will head into Tuesday night\u2019s event with a wide lead over the field, garnering the support of more than 4 in 10 of those who say they plan to caucus.",

            "article_content": "Hillary Clinton met with multiple leaders of prominent civil rights organizations in Harlem Tuesday African-Americans are viewed as a key voting bloc headed into the South Carolina primary Hillary Clinton told an audience of top African-American thinkers and legislators on Tuesday in Harlem that ending racial inequities in the United States would be \u201cthe mission\u201d of her presidency. In a speech as political as it was policy focused, Clinton laid out plans to use the federal government to ensure end inequality. Race, Clinton said, \u201cstill plays a significant role in determining who gets ahead in America and who gets left behind.\u201d Clinton called for \u201cend-to-end\u201d criminal justice reform, more support for African-American homeowners and a $20 billion spending plan aimed \u201cspecifically at creating jobs for young people\u201d in minority communities. Clinton\u2019s remarks also took aim square at Bernie Sanders, her opponent in the Democratic nomination. Without naming the Vermont senator, Clinton cast him as a \u201csingle-issue\u201d candidate ill fit to address all the issues facing America. \u201cThe truth is we aren\u2019t a single-issue country,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cWe face a complex set of economic, social and political challenges. They are intersectional, they are reinforcing and we have to take the all on.\u201d \u201cIt is not enough for your economic plan to by break up the banks. You also need a serious plan to create jobs especially in places where unemployment remains stubbornly high,\u201d she said. And in some of her strongest rhetoric of the speech, Clinton implied that Sanders was a late-comer to the African-American community, a knock that mimics what some close to the Clinton campaign have said about Sanders. \u201cIf we continue to ask black people to vote for us, we cannot minimize the reality of the lives they lead,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cYou can\u2019t just show up at election time and say the right things. You can\u2019t start building relationships a few weeks before a vote.\u201d Clinton said combating inequality has been her \u201cnorth star\u201d since her days as an aide at the Children\u2019s Defense Fund and refuted that idea that she was talking about race in America two weeks before the South Carolina primary because of politics. \u201cWe have to demonstrate a sustained commitment to building opportunity, creating prosperity and writing wrongs, not just every two or four years, not just when the cameras are on and people are watching but every single day,\u201d Clinton said. And to cap off her call for a focus on racial inequality, Clinton said that \u201canyone\u201d asking for African-Americans votes \u201chas a responsibility to grapple with this reality.\u201d Clinton was joined at the event by a group of New York Democratic heavyweights, including New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, New York Mayor Bill De Blasio, former Attorney General Eric Holder, Rep. Charlie Rangel and Al Sharpton. While Clinton\u2019s proposal was policy heavy, the timing of the remarks were clearly political. After narrowly winning in Iowa and losing handily in New Hampshire, Clinton\u2019s race for the Democratic nomination now turns more diverse contests in Nevada and South Carolina, where black voters make up a larger portion of the electorate. African-American voters made up 15% of the electorate in Nevada\u2019s caucuses in 2008 and with the race between Clinton and Sanders getting closer, the demographic could tip the balance. Earlier on Tuesday, Clinton met with multiple leaders of prominent civil rights organizations in Harlem in an effort to gather and shore up support from black voters. \u201cThe work that each and every one of your organizations do is in furtherance of civil rights and economic justice and social justice and political participation,\u201d she told the leaders. \u201cI am grateful for what you all have done for so many years,\u201d Clinton added. While the former secretary of state has been leading opponent Bernie Sanders with black voters, the Vermont senator has attracted a number of endorsements from high-profile African-Americans. Attendees at Clinton\u2019s meeting included National Urban League President and CEO Marc H. Morial; National Coalition on Black Civic Participation President and CEO Melanie Campbell; National Association for the Advancement of Colored People President and CEO Cornell W. Brooks; National Action Network founder and President Rev. Al Sharpton; Lawyers\u2019 Committee for Civil Rights Under Law President and Executive Director Kristen Clarke; Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights President and CEO Wade Henderson; National Bar Association President Benjamin L. Crump; President and Director Council NAACP Legal defense and Education Fund Sherrilyn Ifill and National Council of Negro Women Chair Ingrid Saunders Jones. Sanders met with Sharpton last week, though the reverend has not endorsed a candidate. Clinton has made race a centerpiece of her campaign since she launched last year. Her first speech was on criminal justice reform and Clinton has made repeated overtures to the African American community for months. Earlier this month, Clinton visited Flint, Michigan, to address the city\u2019s water crisis where men, woman and children have been poisoned by untreated, lead-filled water. \u201cIt is a horrifying story but what makes it even worse is that it is not a coincidence that this was allowed to happen in largely back, largely poor community,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cJust ask yourself, could this have ever occurred in a wealthy white suburb of Detroit? Absolutely not.\u201d \u201cFlint is not alone. There are many Flints across our country. Places where people of color and the poor have been left out and left behind,\u201d she said.",

            "article_content": "\"One of the individuals that has been with us time and time again has been Hillary Clinton,\" said New York Rep. Gregory Meeks Clinton said she was honored by the endorsement Hillary Clinton on Thursday captured a vital endorsement from a key African-American political power bloc just at the moment she needed it most as she seeks to shore up her expected fortress of minority voters from a surging Bernie Sanders. The endorsement by the political arm of the Congressional Black Caucus comes as the Vermont senator is trying to expand his mostly white coalition after his New Hampshire primary triumph to compete on the national stage. \u201cBlack folks are not dumb. They come out for individuals that have their best interest at heart,\u201d said New York Rep. Gregory Meeks, chair of the CBC political action committee told CNN\u2019s Carol Costello on \u201cNewsroom.\u201d The endorsement\u2019s timing was significant, coming just hours before Clinton and Sanders are due to clash in their latest debate in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in which she is expected to aggressively highlight her record of fighting for African-American voters. The CBC PAC\u2019s backing also bolsters Clinton\u2019s effort to position herself as the guardian of the legacy of Barack Obama, the first African-American president, and her strategy of securing the large turnout among black voters she would need in a general election. READ: Key African-American Clinton backers are worried \u201cOne of the individuals that has been with us time and time again has been Hillary Clinton. She has been, her whole career, an individual that has been fighting for issues that are important to the African-American community,\u201d Meeks said. Rep. John Lewis, D-Georgia, a revered civil rights leader in the 1960s, emphasized that point. He told reporters he didn\u2019t recall Sanders\u2019 role in the civil rights movement. \u201cI never saw him. I never met him,\u201d Lewis said. \u201cI was chair of the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee for three years, from 1963 to 1966. I was involved with the sit-ins, the Freedom Rides, the March on Washington, the march from Selma to Montgomery and directed to voter education project for six years. But I met Hillary Clinton. I met President Clinton.\u201d Thursday\u2019s developments are a sign of the increasingly important role of racial politics as the Democratic nominating process as it turns to southern and western states where African-American and Hispanic voters could be decisive. And it follows a long behind-the-scenes effort by the Clinton family to repair ties to the African-American community which were strained during a sometimes rancorous primary season in 2008 against Obama. Clinton said she was honored to be backed by the CBC PAC, which comes just two weeks before the South Carolina primary. \u201cI pledge a new and comprehensive commitment to equity and opportunity for communities of color,\u201d she said in a statement. \u201cThat means reforming our criminal justice system and rebuilding the bonds of trust between our communities and our law enforcement officials,\u201d she said in a statement. \u201cBut it also means making major new investments to create jobs, to make it easier to start and grow a small business, to end redlining in housing, and to build reliable public transit systems.\u201d Sanders is making his own effort to woo African-American voters and opinion leaders. On Wednesday, he sat down with civil rights leader Al Sharpton, who has yet to endorse and rolled out the backing of Ben Jealous, the former head of the NAACP. But he has a significant climb ahead of him. An NBC/Wall Street Journal Marist poll released in late January showed him struggling to attract support among African-American voters in South Carolina, garnering 17% compared to Clinton\u2019s 74%. As he courts African-American voters, Sanders also faces a delicate challenge: He campaigns as a candidate of radical change, which at times means implicitly criticizing Obama\u2019s presidency. In an interview with MSNBC for instance set to air later on Thursday, Sanders knocked Obama for not doing enough to bridge what he said was a \u201chuge gap\u201d between Congress and the American people. \u201cWhat presidential leadership is about closing that gap,\u201d he told MSNBC in an interview that will air Thursday evening on \u201cThe Last Word with Lawrence O\u2019Donnell.\u201d But his warning could open a lane for a new Clinton attack. The former secretary of state\u2019s campaign responded to Sanders by tweeting an article about his comments and parodying the soundbite that got Republican candidate Marco Rubio into trouble in last week\u2019s GOP debate. Let's dispel with this fiction that @POTUS doesn't know what he's doing. He knows exactly what he's doing. https://t.co/DQ4HHj9kXZ \u201cLet\u2019s dispel with this fiction that @POTUS doesn\u2019t know what he\u2019s doing. He knows exactly what he\u2019s doing,\u201d the tweet said, striking a theme that Clinton could use in the debate to portray herself as the heir to Obama, who remains highly popular among African-American Democrats. Key community leaders at the CBC PAC rollout event at the headquarters of the Democratic National Committee in Washington also questioned the commitment of Sanders to the history of the African American community. Nightcap: Clinton regroups and refocuses after New Hampshire blowout | Sign up North Carolina Rep. G. K. Butterfield sought to distinguish Clinton from Sanders as a candidate with foreign policy experience, achievable goals and an awareness of issues affecting African-Americans. \u201cWe must have a president who is knowledgeable on both domestic and foreign policy,\u201d said Butterfield, chairman of the Congressional Black Caucus. \u201cWe must have a president who understands the racial divide, not someone who just acquired the knowledge recently.\u201d \u201cWe need a president who doesn\u2019t simply campaign and promise wonderful things \u2013 things that are politically impossible to achieve,\u201d he added. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi called the CBC PAC endorsement \u201ca very big deal\u201d but stopped short of endorsing Clinton herself during her weekly news conference. Meanwhile Sanders\u2019 backer backer and CBC member Keith Ellison made clear that though the CBC PAC had endorsed Sanders, the CBC itself had no input into the decision. \u201cCong\u2019l Black Caucus (CBC) has NOT endorsed in presidential. Separate CBCPAC endorsed withOUT input from CBC membership, including me.\u201d Cong'l Black Caucus (CBC) has NOT endorsed in presidential. Separate CBCPAC endorsed withOUT input from CBC membership, including me. Clinton received support from 90% of the CBC\u2019s political action committee in the vote by the board, and Sanders did not receive any votes. Ellison, however, does not sit on the board and therefore did not get a vote. CNN\u2019s Dan Merica contributed to this report.",

Paul LePage at a Friday news conference semi-apologized for his wording \u201cslip-up\u201d but accused the press of trying to twist his words. \u201cI made one slip-up,\u201d LePage conceded. \u201cI may have made many slip-ups. I was going impromptu in my brain, didn\u2019t catch up to my mouth. Instead of saying, \u2018Maine women,\u2019 I said, \u2018White women.\u2019 I\u2019m not going to apologize to the Maine women for that because if you go to Maine you will see we are essentially 95 percent white.\u201d Later he clarified, \u201cIf I slipped up and used the wrong word, then I apologize to all the Maine women.\u201d Alluding to one of the \u201cRocky\u201d movies, LePage told reporters at the press conference, \u201cYous don\u2019t like me and I don\u2019t like you.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re in the back pocket of Maine bloggers,\u201d he continued, referencing the site that first highlighted his remarks. That blog, called Get Right Maine, is run by Lance Dutson, a Republican operative. Asked at a town hall meeting on Wednesday night what his administration was doing to combat the state\u2019s drug issues, LePage referenced new legislation aimed at traffickers, then delivered his roiling explanation. \u201cThese aren\u2019t the people who take drugs,\u201d LePage said, in comments first picked up by the Portland Press Herald. \u201cThese are guys with the name D-Money, Smoothie, Shifty. These type of guys. They come from Connecticut and New York, they come up here, they sell their heroin, then they go back home. Incidentally, half the time they impregnate a young, white girl before they leave, which is a real sad thing because then we have another issue we\u2019ve got to deal with down the road.\u201d LePage denied using names like \u201cSmoothie\u201d for their racial connotation. \u201cWhat\u2019re they, black?\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if they\u2019re White, Black, Asian, I don\u2019t know,\u201d He also rejected the suggestion that race played any role in his reference to \u201ca young, white girl.\u201d On Thursday, a spokesman for LePage, Peter Steele, said the governor wasn\u2019t discussing race. \u201cThe governor is not making comments about race. Race is irrelevant. What is relevant is the cost to state taxpayers for welfare and the emotional costs for these kids who are born as a result of involvement with drug traffickers. His heart goes out to these kids because he had a difficult childhood too. We need to stop the drug traffickers from coming into our state,\u201d Steele said. LePage, a Republican, has been a controversial figure in Maine for years. In 2011, he once famously told unhappy members of a local NAACP chapter to \u201ckiss my butt.\u201d Hillary Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign called LePage\u2019s comments \u201cracist rants.\u201d \u201cGovernor LePage\u2019s comments tonight are not only offensive and hurtful but they try to cover up the very real epidemic of drug abuse facing people in his state and across the country,\u201d Marlon Marshall, the director of states and political engagement for the Clinton campaign, said in a statement. \u201cLePage\u2019s racist rants sadly distract from efforts to address one of our nation\u2019s most pressing problems,\u201d added Marshall, a top African-American staffer on the Clinton campaign. LePage has endorsed New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie for the GOP presidential nomination. Christie, who chaired the Republican Governors Association during LePage\u2019s successful 2014 re-election bid, has described his colleague from Maine as \u201ca great friend\u201d and called his backing \u201can incredible honor.\u201d In an interview with CBS the day after LePage\u2019s 2014 victory, Christie described him \u201cas just one of the most decent, honorable people I\u2019ve ever met \u2013 wears his heart on his sleeve, loves his state, has an amazing personal story.\u201d Christie\u2019s campaign did not respond to CNN requests for comment. But on Saturday, NBC News reported that Christie stood by the Maine governor, saying, \u201cwe can\u2019t judge people by one set of remarks they make.\u201d \u201cIt doesn\u2019t change a bit for me my affection for him, my respect for him, as a leader and as a person, and he\u2019s a good man. And he\u2019s apologized,\u201d Christie told MSNBC\u2019s Joe Scarborough and Mika Brzezinski in an interview set to air Monday on \u201cMorning Joe.\u201d CNN\u2019s Cassie Spodak, Jeremy Ryan and Dan Merica contributed to this report.",

A stray observation on Hillary Clinton\u2019s opponents could set off a firestorm, just like the raucous crowds he is sure to attract will help gin up energy and excitement around her candidacy. We\u2019ve seen it happen before. In 2008, his frustration over Hillary\u2019s flailing campaign occasionally boiled over into angry or ill-conceived public attacks on then-Sen. Barack Obama. His outbursts gave Obama\u2019s team easy openings to attack Hillary Clinton and contributed to a sense that her campaign was floundering. Clinton recovered in 2012, offering full-throated support for Obama\u2019s re-election in a memorable speech at the Democratic National Convention. As he returns to the campaign trail, here\u2019s a look at high and low moments of Bill Clinton, campaigner-in-chief. New Hampshire, 2008: On the eve of the New Hampshire primary, a plainly frustrated Bill Clinton \u2013 reeling from Hillary Clinton\u2019s loss in Iowa \u2013 launched a long and heated attack on Obama\u2019s opposition to the Iraq War. Clinton said the story of Obama\u2019s long-held opposition to the war was bogus, that Obama and Hillary Clinton had the same position, really, and so \u201cthis whole thing is the biggest fairytale I\u2019ve ever seen.\u201d Apart from being, at the best, misleading, Clinton\u2019s comments set off Obama supporters, who didn\u2019t appreciate hearing one of the bedrocks of his candidacy assailed in such blunt terms. \u201cI understand they\u2019re frustrated right now,\u201d Obama told the New York Times, referring to the Clintons. \u201cI suspect that they\u2019ll both try to get back on track in terms of the strategy for them to do better than they feel they\u2019re doing right now.\u201d Hillary Clinton would win a comeback victory in the New Hampshire primary, but her campaign failed to pick up any significant momentum ahead of key contests in Nevada and South Carolina. South Carolina, 2008: Bill Clinton\u2019s worst moment on the trail came on January 26, 2008, as South Carolinians headed to the polls for their hotly contested primary. Obama and Hillary Clinton had split the first two contests, in Iowa and New Hampshire, but polls showed the Palmetto State leaning strongly toward the young Illinois senator. 2008: Rev. Jackson's open mic gaffe Asked by a reporter, \u201cWhat does it say about Barack Obama that it takes two of you to beat him?\u201d Clinton, who had been up and down the trail in South Carolina, responded by calling the question \u201cbait,\u201d then saying, \u201cJesse Jackson won South Carolina in \u201984 and \u201888. Jackson ran a good campaign. And Obama ran a good campaign here.\u201d Many observers believed Clinton meant to suggest that an Obama victory in the state should be dismissed because it was just another black candidate winning with the support of the African-American community. Jackson did it twice, while still failing to win the nomination. \u201cThe only possible reason for invoking Jackson\u2019s name was to telegraph the following message: Barack Obama is black, so if a lot of black people decide to vote for him \u2013 doubtless out of racial solidarity \u2013 it doesn\u2019t really mean squat,\u201d Washington Post columnist Eugene Robinson wrote in the aftermath. Obama won by 28 points in South Carolina, and kept on winning, while Clinton was left trying to explain what he\u2019d meant. Before the Pennsylvania primary, 2008: As Obama took a firm grip on the nomination, Clinton was unnerved by the reaction to his comments in South Carolina. \u201cWhat happened there is a total myth and a mugging,\u201d Clinton told CNN in March, before taking his allegations a step further in April. \u201cI think that they played the race card on me,\u201d he said in an interview with radio station WHYY before the Pennsylvania primary. \u201cWe now know, from memos from the campaign, that they planned to do it all along.\u201d Asked about the former president\u2019s allegations, Obama drove home the dagger. \u201cSo former President Clinton dismissed my victory in South Carolina as being similar to Jesse Jackson and he is suggesting that somehow I had something to do with it?\u201d he told reporters. \u201cYou better ask him what he meant by that. I have no idea what he meant. These were words that came out of his mouth. Not words that came out of mine.\u201d Democratic National Convention in Charlotte, 2012: The \u201cexplainer-in-chief\u201d is born. With Obama\u2019s re-election campaign mostly gliding along despite concerns about a slowly recovering economy, Clinton stepped to the plate to deliver a keynote address focused almost entirely on putting the president\u2019s record into a more flattering context. \u201cNow, are we where we want to be today?\u201d he asked \u201cNo. Is the president satisfied? Of course not. But are we better off than we were when he took office? The answer is yes.\u201d Turning to the Republicans, Clinton delivered his jabs with a smile. \u201cWhen Congressman Ryan looked into that TV camera and attacked President Obama\u2019s Medicare savings as, quote, \u2018the biggest, coldest power play,\u2019 I didn\u2019t know whether to laugh or cry,\u201d he said. The audience in Charlotte swooned and most commentators declared it a rousing success. Clinton \u201ccut through the predictable partisan spin by making a credible and compelling case for Barack Obama\u2019s re-election \u2013 better, frankly, than the president has made himself to date,\u201d said John Avlon, the CNN political commentator and Daily Beast editor-in-chief, after the speech. \u201cIf swing voters all listened to Wednesday night\u2019s speech, I believe Barack Obama would win this election.\u201d With Clinton making more frequent appearances on the trail, Obama would go on to do just that, handily defeating challenger Mitt Romney in November. Iowa, 2015: Bill Clinton at his best was on display as recently as October 24, when he warmed up a crowd of supporters in Iowa ahead of state Democrats\u2019 annual Jefferson Jackson Dinner. \u201cWhen you elect a president you have got to say, \u2018Who is the person I think is most likely to keep big, bad things from happening and to make more good things happen?\u2019\u201d Clinton said at an event in Des Moines. \u201cI don\u2019t think it is a terribly close question.\u201d This was the calm, reasoned \u2013 in tone and context \u2013 performance Bill Clinton had given on behalf of President Obama in 2012, in fits and starts during the 2008 nominating contest and toward the end of that general election, after the bruises of the primary fight had begun to heal. During Hurricane Sandy, October 2012: On the morning of October 29, with the storm bearing down, the White House announced the president would return to Washington instead of stumping that day in Orlando. An event the next day in Wisconsin was also scrapped. Less than a week out from Election Day, Obama was effectively absent from the campaign \u2013 stuck at home monitoring federal response and relief efforts. Luckily for the president, he was able to put his fate in the hands of an on-point Bill Clinton, who deftly headlined two rallies, including one at the University of Central Florida. \u201cI have very strong feelings about this election,\u201d Clinton told the mostly young crowd \u2013 one Obama needed to get out to the polls. \u201cBut this is not about the candidates. This about you and your future. It\u2019s about two very different approaches and which one is more likely to build a 21st century of the American dream.\u201d Another potential crisis averted, again with Clinton\u2019s aid, Obama would score a narrow victory in Florida days later. Perhaps the most bizarre moment of the 2008 Clinton-Obama saga came near its end, during the Democratic National Convention in Denver. By then fully supportive of Obama\u2019s bid, Clinton was even scheduled to campaign for wife\u2019s former rival. Then, apparently piqued over being asked to speak about national security during his address to the convention, Clinton went rogue. \u201cSuppose you\u2019re a voter, and you\u2019ve got candidate X and candidate Y,\u201d he said at an offsite event in Denver. \u201cCandidate X agrees with you on everything, but you don\u2019t think that candidate can deliver on anything at all. Candidate Y you agree with on about half the issues, but he can deliver. Which candidate are you going to vote for?\u201d Then, after a pause, he added: \u201cThis has nothing to do with what\u2019s going on now.\u201d Clinton\u2019s remarks mirrored the argument used by his wife\u2019s campaign throughout the primary: that Obama lacked the experience and tactical range, which Hillary herself had accrued over time, to get his legislative agenda through Congress. It was an odd moment, creating a swirl of controversy as the party prepared to crown its nominee. Naturally, the McCain campaign pounced. \u201cBy putting his country first, John McCain hasn\u2019t always been the most popular public official,\u201d a spokesman said in response to Clinton\u2019s riff. \u201cBut it has always made him effective \u2013 so, John McCain is clearly candidate \u2018Y\u2019 in the equation.\u201d The episode would be mostly swept away by an eventual Obama landslide, but its memory only confirms that, for all his enviable talents, Bill Clinton is among the most powerful political wild cards.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Charlton McIlwain is associate dean for faculty development & diversity and associate professor of media, culture, and communication at NYU Steinhardt. The views expressed here are his own. Charlton McIlwain: This election cycle we heard about the \"new white,\" but there is no such thing It's just the same old white (supremacist) narrative we have seen since Reconstruction, he writes Donald Trump\u2019s election ushered in the rise of the \u201cnew white,\u201d a rising movement poised to recalibrate America\u2019s racial balance of power. The movement\u2019s narrative is simple: Whether Trump\u2019s election signals triumph or doom, America\u2019s most important next step is to reach out, embrace, and better understand the ignored, maligned and threatened white working class. Heralded by voices on both the left and right, the narrative explains Trump\u2019s victory, diagnoses Hillary Clinton\u2019s Electoral College loss, and prescribes how the nation should move forward. The narrative supporting the new white wants us to accept four primary truths. The left\u2019s identity politics are too divisive. Liberal elites are too insular. Class \u2013 not race \u2013 anxieties animate today\u2019s white working-class frustration and fears. Finally, whether Trump maintains the new order, or the left overthrows it, we must invest our time and energy understanding white people. As much as this narrative might argue otherwise, however, the new white is the old white under different cover. If we allow their pleas to heap more attention on white America, black and brown Americans will find ourselves refighting the battles our civil rights forebears fought, rather than continuing our long march toward racial justice. Our present moment is strikingly similar to our past, and today\u2019s racial politics are just as troublesome as they were at the dawn of Reconstruction, when the power of race to spur white anxiety was most palpable. Take as an example the 1875 political cartoon in Harper\u2019s titled \u201cColored Rule in a Reconstructed State.\u201d In it, Thomas Nast caricatured black legislators towering over cowering white counterparts with raised fists. The caption chastises them for \u201caping the lowest whites.\u201d The message was clear. In a nation where whiteness and white people were the principal measure for good, good citizenship, and good governing, the idea of black rule was untenable. So what does this have to do with today\u2019s new white? Turns out, a lot. Both Nast\u2019s gambit and the narrative of the new white depend on strategies of old-fashioned white supremacy. Working-class whites give Trump the White House When the new white lumps together all liberals, leftists, Democrats and elites and rejects them, they take a tack from Thomas Nast. They essentially accuse nonwhites of aping the worst of white people. When Donald Trump asks African-Americans and Hispanic-Americans what the hell they have to lose by rejecting the lumped-together (white) liberals, he manages to call nonwhites stupid while calling liberal whites out for their myopia, as research shows that whites are more likely not to try to understand nonwhites than the other way around. When whites do interact with people with different views than themselves, more than half say they come away thinking they have less in common with the person. Significantly fewer blacks leave such conversations believing so. The simple fact is, the structure of everyday life in the United States practically dictates that many nonwhites must inhabit and socialize in white spaces. Blacks and Hispanics, more than whites, believe churches should be more diverse, and attend mostly white churches more than whites attend black and Hispanic churches. Blacks and Hispanics go to jobs every day in workplaces that are mostly white. I went to a KKK rally and saw the future of the alt-right Even Newt Gingrich has admitted, \u201cIf you are a normal white American, the truth is you don\u2019t understand being black in America.\u201d By not distinguishing these failures by race, the new white narrative discredits nonwhites along with their white allies. By doing so it also minimizes and discredits the larger cause for which they fight, whether that cause be the 19th century\u2019s radical Reconstruction or the 21st century fight for racial justice. We must see the new white narrative for what  it really is, an attempt to refocus public attention and political capital away from people of color. Trump and many of those he\u2019s chosen to lead his administration are the new white\u2019s principal ambassadors. They take stock of the last few years as blacks fought against police brutality, Muslims battled religious persecution, and Hispanics defended themselves and their families from mass deportations. These representatives of the new white respond: Your concerns don\u2019t matter as much as working-class folk (white people) for whom America\u2019s promise was designed but has been denied. Kanye West, do YOU care about black people? This is not new. \u201cRace\u201d was a concept applied originally to African slaves. Whites made Africans raced beings, and they saw themselves only as \u201cAmericans.\u201d This sleight of hand allowed whites then and now to position themselves as \u201cnormal\u201d and dismiss black and brown people\u2019s grievances as racially self-indulgent. When a majority of blacks vote for Obama, white people say race motivates them. When most white folks vote for Trump, Romney or Bush, they say those candidates\u2019 race doesn\u2019t matter. The new white narrative claims blacks and other people of color are blinded by race, while white people are race blind. This fallacy makes the new white\u2019s plea for attention seemingly justifiable. Historian Mark Lilla claims that \u201cthe fixation on diversity in our schools and in the press has produced a generation of liberals and progressives narcissistically unaware of conditions outside their self-defined groups.\u201d What he and others including Joan Williams, Michael Lerner, and Charles Camosy are really saying \u2013 to Black Lives Matter activists and others pushing for racial progress \u2013 is hold up. Slow down. Don\u2019t push too hard. Not yet. Stop what you\u2019re doing and think about the greater good, about America, about unity. Reach out and try to understand white people\u2019s grievances so that we can come together and govern together.  We\u2019ve heard this clever distraction before. In the 1950s and 1960s and beyond, ardent racists and racial justice sympathizers alike slow-played civil rights. While the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. dismantled this rationale in the press and elsewhere, Nina Simone best captured the sentiment of King and others. \u201cI don\u2019t trust you any more,\u201d Simone scolds in \u201cMississippi Goddam.\u201d \u201cYou keep on saying \u2018Go slow!\u2019 Go slow!\u2019 But that\u2019s just the trouble. \u2018Do it slow.\u2019 Desegregation. \u2018Do it slow.\u2019 Mass participation. \u2018Do it slow.\u2019 Reunification. \u2018Do it slow.\u2019 Do things gradually. \u2018Do it slow.\u2019 But bring more tragedy\u2019. Do it slow.\u2019 Why don\u2019t you see it? Why don\u2019t you feel it? I don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know.\u201d But white supremacy accomplishes its most insidious work by imposing one simple demand on those who fight for racial justice: Wait. When it comes to debunking the myth of the new white, we cannot and must not wait.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: The Rev. William J. Barber II, a Protestant minister, is president of the North Carolina NAACP, president of Repairers of the Breach, a progressive ecumenical organization, and founder of Moral Mondays, a grass-roots movement for racial and economic justice. He is the author of \u201cThe Third Reconstruction: Moral Mondays, Fusion Politics, and the Rise of a New Justice Movement.\u201d The opinions expressed in this commentary are his. Rev. William Barber: Before Gov. Patrick McCrory leaves office Republicans are trying to strip power from Governor-elect Roy Cooper Seeing that they were failing at the ballot box, ultraconservatives passed legislation to strip the executive and courts of key powers, William Barber writes On Wednesday, December 14, an all-white caucus of the North Carolina General Assembly called the legislature into a second special session, giving their fellow legislators only two hours\u2019 notice. \u202aGov. Patrick McCrory had called the first special session, a one-day affair on Tuesday, with the purpose of allocating disaster relief in the wake of Hurricane Matthew. But in the surprise second session, the ultraconservative contingent that controls North Carolina\u2019s Republican supermajority unleashed an instant barrage of bills to nullify the results of Democrat Roy Cooper\u2019s recent defeat of McCrory and the voters\u2019 elevation of a distinguished African American jurist, Mike Morgan, to the state\u2019s Supreme Court. The supermajority\u2019s surprise attacks slash the prerogatives of the incoming governor and reconfigure  the state\u2019s court system to fend off challenges to legislators\u2019 power. From executive appointment powers to state and county boards of election to hundreds of civil service posts, this legislation was designed to strip the executive branch of its power before Governor-elect Cooper takes office. Other legislation seeks to remove oversight of the General Assembly\u2019s actions from the North Carolina Supreme Court\u2019s purview; Justice Morgan\u2019s election gives the Court a Democratic majority. They want to subvert the will of the voters, both in the recent election and in elections to come. This brazen power grab only confirms their fear of North Carolina\u2019s interracial nonpartisan Forward Together Moral Movement, better known as \u201cMoral Monday.\u201d According to a December 5 analysis by Public Policy Polling, \u201cThe seeds of McCrory\u2019s defeat really were planted by the Moral Monday movement,\u201d which lowered the popular Republican governor\u2019s polls from 65 to 35 and gave McCrory \u201c39 months in a row of an underwater approval rating.\u201d  Moral Monday recently helped oust McCrory and elect Justice Morgan by a total of 345,000 votes. NC Gov. Pat McCrory concedes race Though their current attempt to block the will of the people is morally wrong, the extremist supermajority\u2019s fear of the voters is well grounded. This past July, the US Court of Appeals for the 4th District ruled in North Carolina NAACP v. McCrory that the extremists in the General Assembly had \u201ctargeted African Americans with almost surgical precision,\u201d and overturned the state\u2019s 2013 voter suppression bill. Another coalition victory in federal court overturned the legislature\u2019s \u201cracial gerrymander\u201d in 28 districts, requiring new district lines and a special election in 2017; the US Supreme Court is reviewing that case now. Our Moral Mondays movement is here because the extremists who control the state\u2019s GOP have consistently subverted our democratic process. We are here because, after four long years of naming and resisting extremism in North Carolina, the people of this state have chosen a new direction for our future. Extremist Republicans who cut taxes for the wealthy, denied health care to poor people, attacked public education, suppressed votes and targeted immigrants and minorities with mean-spirited legislation are making their last stand against the ballot box and the courts. The 2017 special election for 28 House and Senate seats, if the US Supreme Court allows it to go forward, may go quite badly for them indeed. How progressives won a key victory in North Carolina Though his opponent, Roy Cooper, had more than a five-thousand vote lead, McCrory refused to concede. He then spent nearly a month making demonstrably false claims about \u201cvoter fraud\u201d aimed largely at African Americans. His campaign manager said, \u201cWith each passing day, we discover more and more cases of voting fraud and other irregularities.\u201d Questioned about these claims, McCrory\u2019s spokesman Ricky Diaz replied, \u201cThe real question people should be asking is, why is Roy Cooper fighting to count the votes of dead people and felons.\u201d McCrory\u2019s campaign was unable to corroborate any such thing. The GOP-controlled state Board of Elections recently reported that from 2000 to 2012, forty million ballots had been cast and there were only two cases of fraud, neither of which resulted in conviction. Accounts of alien abductions outnumber proven instances of electoral fraud in North Carolina. Race underlies many of these schemes. Under Senate leader Phil Berger and House Speaker Tim Moore\u2019s leadership, we have not only witnessed the attempt to nullify Mike Morgan\u2019s election to the Supreme Court, but watch their legislature pass what we and the federal courts agreed was an overtly racist voter suppression bill. And although HB2 made North Carolina nationally infamous for Gov. McCrory\u2019s attacks on LGBTQ rights, that law also stripped all victims of discrimination of any kind the right to sue in state courts; minorities and women suffer the most from workplace discrimination.  Passed by legislators who espouse their belief in local control, HB2 also barred counties and cities from passing local ordinances to raise the minimum wage or adopt any statute related to workplace safety for children, minority set-aside, payment of wages or working conditions. This special session was planned in illegal, secret meetings that excluded every African-American member of both the House and Senate.  The North Carolina NAACP and the Moral Movement see what is happening, and we have already begun to take nonviolent direct action to resist this political coup d\u2019etat, even as we prepare to fight it in the courts. I and more than 50 others were arrested in protests this week. When elected officials consistently seek to subvert democracy, a free people must hold them accountable. Our state Constitution expressly forbids the secret cabal that planned this special session; it contains a Reconstruction-era amendment banning \u201csecret societies\u201d from the legislature. Intended to bar the Ku Klux Klan from involvement in state government, it applies in this instance also. The Forward Together Moral Movement is in Raleigh to petition our elected representatives and insist that they respect the Constitution they swore to uphold. We have come too far to turn back now. The people of this state have voted and the federal courts have spoken. We are moving forward together, not one step back.",

Olson is a Partner in Gibson, Dunn & Crutcher\u2019s Washington, D.C. office and served as U.S. Solicitor General during the presidency of George W. Bush. One of the nation\u2019s premier appellate and United States Supreme Court advocates,  he argued 62 cases in the Supreme Court, including Hollingsworth v. Perry, the case upholding the overturning of California\u2019s Proposition 8, banning same-sex marriages. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. Ted Olson: At time of discord in US, 'Loving' film reminds us of the kind of people we aspire to be in America Olson: It's the true story of an interracial couple's determination, with their lawyers, to overturn institutionalized racism At a time of intense division and acrimony in this country, we need to be reminded of what we stand for, what unites us, and the kind of people we aspire to be.  That very inspiration comes to us in a timely movie that tells a true story of love, grit and determination by a single, lonely couple who, along with their courageous lawyers, convinced the US Supreme Court to overturn decades of institutionalized racism and hate. Just 50 years ago next spring, the Supreme Court, in Loving v. Virginia, struck down as unconstitutional the laws of Virginia and 15 other states prohibiting interracial marriage.  During the 15 years prior to the Court\u2019s decision, 14 other states had repealed or overturned such laws.  It is disheartening to think that as recently as the end of World War II, three-fifths of our states had prohibited marriage between persons of different races. Virginia\u2019s laws made it a felony for people of different races to marry, or to live in Virginia after having married elsewhere, punishing violators with a prison term of up to five years. The parties to the Loving case, Mildred Jeter, a black woman, and Richard Loving, a white man, had married lawfully in the District of Columbia in 1958 and returned to their home community in Virginia to live and work near family and friends.  They were arrested, handcuffed, jailed and convicted of violating Virginia\u2019s anti-miscegenation laws. The judge suspended the jail sentence on the condition that the Lovings leave Virginia and not return together for 25 years. \u201cThe fact that [God] separated the races [and placed them on separate continents],\u201d he said, \u201cshows that he did not intend for the races to mix.\u201d Opinion: How the Lovings changed our American lives The Lovings tried moving back to the District of Columbia. But that meant raising their children in a city, far from their families and friends, and the beautiful Virginia countryside they had known as home for their entire lives. So they returned to Virginia, the home of Thomas Jefferson, George Washington, John Marshall, Patrick Henry, and James Madison, only to encounter again the ugly face of hatred, discrimination and the prospect of years in prison. With the help of civil rights lawyers, including from the American Civil Liberties Union, the Lovings attempted repeatedly to overturn Virginia\u2019s law, fighting judicial precedents going back as far as the 1896 US Supreme Court decision in Plessy v. Ferguson, which had upheld separate \u201cbut equal\u201d public schools, an opinion unanimously overturned by the Brown v. Board of Education court in 1954. All to no avail.  Virginia\u2019s highest court ultimately rejected their challenge citing an earlier decision by that court referring to the importance of the \u201cpreservation of racial integrity\u201d and the \u201cdivine natural law,\u201d which forbids the \u201ccorruption of races.\u201d Despite the years of pain, uncertainty, fright, and state-sponsored hostility, the Lovings did not give up, and nine years after their marriage, their case made its way to the United States Supreme Court. So agonizing was the process that the Lovings could not bear to attend the arguments by their lawyers in court. Richard poignantly told his lawyers to \u201ctell the judges I love my wife.\u201d TV's 'first' interracial kiss The Justices must have heard him. The unanimous opinion by Chief Justice Warren held that Virginia\u2019s miscegenation statutes rested solely upon distinctions drawn according to race, and were therefore \u201codious to a free people whose institutions are founded upon the doctrine of equality.\u201d  Finding that \u201cmarriage is one of the basic civil rights of man,\u201d the court found that denial of that right based upon racial classifications violated the principles of equality and due process guaranteed by the Fourteenth Amendment to the Constitution. The Lovings were finally free, their marriage finally recognized as their fundamental right, and they were free at last to raise their children as full and equal Americans. Old Navy attacked for interracial ad The story of the Lovings\u2019 long ordeal, their stubborn fight for their right to marry, their pain, and ultimately, their joy, is told with passion, sensitivity, and empathy in the film, \u201cLoving,\u201d directed by Jeff Nichols, and starring Ruth Negga as Mildred and Joel Edgerton as Richard Loving.  It is inspirational and uplifting.  The power of love, and the ultimate majesty of our constitutional ideals are reaffirmed brilliantly.  Everyone should see this movie; our children must see it. The politics of the moment, particularly during a bitter, acrid presidential election, can be so corrosive, and the focus on the immediate advantage to one set of persons or issues so intense, that we can easily lose sight and sense of what this nation means and what kind of people we are\u2014and hope to be. Seeing what Richard and Mildred Loving meant to one another, and how hard and long they fought for their freedom and equality is precisely what we need this holiday season as an antidote to the dispiriting and debasing poison that we have been through these past brutal months.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Eric Schneiderman is New York\u2019s attorney general. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. Eric Schneiderman: Allowing GOP to become dominant at state level led to Democratic defeats in 2016 State Democratic leaders will be key to checking federal power of GOP, New York's attorney general says As Democrats struggle to make sense of Donald Trump\u2019s victory, we need look no further than our party\u2019s failure at the state level. We have allowed Republicans to dominate in state elections and build astonishing power. The GOP now controls 69 of 99 legislative chambers across America. They hold nearly two-thirds of the governors\u2019 mansions. And, in 25 states, they have complete control of the government, including both executive and legislative branches. This gives Republicans control of the rules that govern voting and the reapportionment of legislative and congressional districts. The big takeaway from 2016 is that, despite the public supporting many Democratic positions on policy, Republicans are now reaping the benefits of their 30-year organizing strategy, supported by dozens of mega-wealthy donors. As someone who has recruited and fundraised for state candidates, I know that while Democrats have been great at raising money for presidential candidates, Republicans have an overwhelming advantage as you move down-ballot. Since 2010, Republican candidates at the state level have outraised their Democratic counterparts by more than $700 million, according to data from the National Institute on Money in State Politics. In that same period, the Republican Governors Association outraised its Democratic counterpart by a nearly 2-to-1 margin and, at the state legislative level, Democrats were outraised nearly 3-to-1 before we even take into account independent expenditures, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. And as Republicans have gained control at the state level, they\u2019ve used their power to enact a massive phalanx of legal voter suppression \u2013 strict voter ID laws, cutbacks in early voting, new registration requirements and other regulations \u2013 aimed at depressing voters in core Democratic constituencies. Opinion: For some, 'I Voted' sticker isn't easy to get According to the Brennan Center for Justice, 14 states added restrictive voting laws between the 2012 and 2016 elections. These states are home to 93 million people and hold 155 of the 270 electoral votes needed to win the presidency. A few examples illuminate how this cynical strategy can translate into the Electoral College and tip the balance in a presidential election: In Wisconsin, which Trump won by just over 25,000 votes, more than 10 times that many eligible voters \u2013 as many as 300,000 people \u2013 may have been disenfranchised because they lacked the proper ID under a strict new voter ID law. While some of North Carolina\u2019s more draconian voting restrictions were struck down just before the election, a purge of early voting sites remained in place. At the end of the state\u2019s early voting period, a GOP memo heralded that African-American turnout had dropped nearly 9%. Trump won the state by fewer than 200,000 votes. Black voters didn't fail Hillary Clinton Florida, along with Iowa and Virginia, permanently disenfranchises anyone with a felony conviction. As a result, roughly 1.5 million Florida residents (almost 10% of the state\u2019s population) are disenfranchised. This year, one in four of Florida\u2019s black residents could not cast a ballot. Clinton lost Florida by just 112,000 votes. The good news for Democrats is that this problem has a clear solution. The founders actually designed our federalist system to deal with attempts at overreach by the federal government. The provisions they put into place to check the power of a \u201ctyrant\u201d may now be put to their greatest test in American history. To be sure, faced with hegemonic Republican power at the federal level, our representatives in Washington need our support, but we may best have their backs by girding for real action at the state level.  The first line of defense will be Democratic governors, attorneys-general and legislatures. Democratic activists must demand that their Democratic state leaders stand up to federal overreach and protect our most vulnerable residents, including immigrants and racial and religious minorities. Those activists should support Democrats when we do the right thing, and get in our faces when we shirk moral leadership. More important for the long-term, we need a broad commitment from activists and donors to take back state governments, starting next year when New Jersey and Virginia have critical gubernatorial, attorney general and state legislative elections. Furthermore, a federal court recently ordered North Carolina to redraw its racially gerrymandered legislative districts and hold new elections in 2017. In 2018, 87 of 99 state legislatures and 36 governorships are up for re-election, the vast majority of which are held by Republicans. This presents Democrats with a clear path forward. Most national progressive groups and donors have never sought to match the other side\u2019s investment in building a state-by-state infrastructure. If we focus our attention where it needs to be, we can make significant gains in the next two years and blunt the worst aspects of the far-right agenda.  The road to a resurgent Democratic Party runs through Madison, Harrisburg, Columbus and Tallahassee. Even more important, it\u2019s the path for winning successful progressive public policy and building a healthier, vibrant and just society.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: The Rev. William J. Barber II, a Protestant minister, is president of the North Carolina NAACP, president of Repairers of the Breach, a progressive ecumenical organization, and founder of Moral Mondays, a grass-roots movement for racial and economic justice. He is the author of \u201cThe Third Reconstruction: Moral Mondays, Fusion Politics, and the Rise of a New Justice Movement.\u201d The opinions expressed in this commentary are his. Rev. William Barber: A coordinated campaign of protest helped secure defeat of North Carolina governor He says that for anyone committed to resisting extremism in the Trump years, McCrory's failure is a case study On Monday, nearly a full month after Election Day, Republican Pat McCrory finally conceded the governor\u2019s race in North Carolina to his Democratic challenger, Roy Cooper. Even as Republicans across the South and Midwest rode the coattails of Donald Trump\u2019s victory to greater control of state governments, McCrory was the only incumbent Republican in the country to lose a statewide race. This is a victory for North Carolina and the \u201cMoral Mondays\u201d movement that arose to resist McCrory\u2019s extremism. For anyone committed to resisting extremism in the coming Trump years, McCrory\u2019s failed one-term governorship is a case study worthy of attention. When McCrory became governor-elect four years ago, I sat down with him to discuss the 14-point moral agenda that a broad coalition of justice organizations had committed to pursue together in this state that went for Obama in 2008 and Romney in 2012. We knew well that the expansion of voting rights we had won in the 2007 legislative session was under attack by Republican strategists in North Carolina and beyond. They had invested millions in state legislature races in 2010 to regain control and gerrymander voting districts to \u201ccrack and pack\u201d our coalition of voters. Only by securing all three branches of government could they complete the makeover of North Carolina they had promised (a set of promises that were echoed by the Trump campaign this year). McCrory\u2019s broad smile echoed his optimism when he talked about getting North Carolina\u2019s economy working again. Celebrated as a moderate mayor in Charlotte, our state\u2019s largest city, McCrory was glad to sit and listen to our concerns. \u201cI\u2019ll meet with you once a month if you will promise not to criticize this administration in public,\u201d McCrory told me. Politics, he believed, was the art of negotiating deals in private. But we had already learned what every American must understand in the coming Trump years: Democracy depends on everyday people standing together in public, refusing to be divided by those who fail to serve the common good. McCrory came into office in 2012 through a backroom deal designed to fracture our moral coalition. Confident that black religious voters could be split off from marriage equality advocates, Republicans put Amendment One on the 2012 primary ballot to define marriage in the state constitution as a union between one man and one woman. McCrory\u2019s coalition of voters was baited by fear of same-sex marriage, much as Trump appealed to our fear of immigrants, Muslims and protesters in this year\u2019s campaign. North Carolina\u2019s 2013 legislative sessions exposed McCrory\u2019s inability to stand up to the extremism that had brought him to power. While Republican governors like John Kasich expanded Medicaid to insure health care for citizens of his state under the Affordable Care Act, McCrory went along with extremists in the Legislature and denied Medicaid expansion to half a million North Carolinians. A majority of those who were denied access to health care were poor, white people in rural counties who had voted for McCrory. When a fellow Republican mayor from Belhaven, North Carolina, reached out asking McCrory to help save the town\u2019s hospital, McCrory said there was nothing he could do. Later that summer, the Supreme Court\u2019s Shelby decision removed preclearance requirements for changes to voting laws in states formerly covered by the Voting Rights Act. Within days, McCrory signed the worst voter suppression bill in the nation. The North Carolina NAACP sued immediately, and after three years of litigation, a federal court made clear the law had intentionally targeted African-Americans with \u201calmost surgical precision.\u201d But North Carolinians knew we could not afford to wait quietly while democracy was under attack. In spring 2013, when the voter suppression bill was still making its way through the Legislature, \u201cMoral Mondays\u201d emerged as the direct action of concerned citizens against the unconstitutional takeover of our state. Over a thousand North Carolinians were arrested in the largest state-government focused civil disobedience campaign in US history (arrests that would later be thrown out by a state superior court judge). We took our stand in public, and we exposed the vulnerability of divide-and-conquer tactics to cross-racial, cross-class fusion coalition building.  In this year\u2019s re-election bid, McCrory\u2019s team tried to use HB2, the so-called \u201cbathroom bill,\u201d to rally a base around fear of transgender neighbors. It didn\u2019t work. We pointed out that the bill wasn\u2019t about bathrooms at all. HB2 attempted to codify discrimination, denied all North Carolinians the right to challenge employment discrimination in state court, and overrode municipal living wage campaigns. That\u2019s why workers stood with preachers and LGBTQ activists stood with the business community to oppose the bill. This moral, fusion organizing effort persuaded a majority of North Carolinians to make McCrory the first governor in our state\u2019s history to lose a re-election bid. Along with much of the rest of the country, North Carolina fell victim this year to the extremism exploited by Donald Trump. But we could not be deceived by the extremism we have endured under Pat McCrory. Though we know too well that America faces some tough days ahead, this moral victory should give all Americans reason to hope that we can revive the heart of our democracy and move forward together to a more perfect union.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Issac Bailey has been a journalist in South Carolina for two decades and was most recently the primary columnist for The Sun News in Myrtle Beach. He was a 2014 Harvard University Nieman fellow. Follow him on Twitter: @ijbailey. The views expressed are his own. The Dylann Roof trial assumes new importance at a time \"white nationalism\" is given undue attention, writes Issac Bailey President-elect's top White House adviser Steve Bannon, as head of Breitbart, provided a platform for the \"alt-right\" It\u2019s only fitting that shortly after being found competent to stand trial, Dylann Roof became his own attorney, setting up the possibility that he could cross examine the survivors of the carnage he is accused of causing or the loved ones of the nine people he allegedly killed, or even turn the proceedings into a spectacle and promote the warped views discovered in his writings. What began as a tragedy and turned into a triumph of (temporary) unity is becoming an unfunny joke. It\u2019s more than that, though. The Roof trial comes soon after President-elect Donald Trump appointed as a top White House adviser Steve Bannon, who in his role as head of Breitbart provided a platform for the self-described \u201calt-right,\u201d which includes the kinds of sentiments long and rightly described as white nationalistic and white supremacist. And the President-elect, likely along with most, if not all, Republican US senators, wants to make a man attorney general who couldn\u2019t get confirmed for a federal post during the Reagan era because of past ugly racial views. Until the election of Donald Trump, it seemed that Roof\u2019s white supremacist views made him an outlier in the 21st century. Young white supremacists are rare and hang out mostly along the fringes of society. That one took up arms and killed nine black people in a historically significant black church in the city where the Civil War began was an anomaly, little more. By contrast, the Michael Slager trial, being held in the same city at the same time as Roof\u2019s, seemed the more important one. Slager is the North Charleston police officer seen shooting a fleeing man in the back multiple times. Slager was equipped with public dollars, armed and trained with the public\u2019s blessing, given the authority to detain, arrest and even kill with the public\u2019s authority. When such a man violates the trust placed in him, it can undermine a democracy like little else. A police officer who abuses his power and goes unpunished seeds the ground for cycles of violence, because it undermines the entire system. In that environment, it becomes every man for himself. Taking the law into one\u2019s own hands, like gangbangers blindly firing off bullets during retaliatory drive-by shootings, becomes routine. That\u2019s why it should concern us that Slager\u2019s actions might go unpunished. He was charged and is standing trial. There\u2019s no guarantee he will be convicted, despite the clear video evidence available. Just ask Rodney King. An unexpected outcome in that case in this charged post-2016 election environment couldn\u2019t come at a worse time. That\u2019s still true. But the Roof trial, which is in its jury selection phase, is taking on even more importance. Why we can't forget the racism of this campaign We needed to be outraged by Roof\u2019s alleged act, needed to cling to each other in a search for comfort in the immediate aftermath of that slaughter, and need the criminal justice system to do what it failed to do so many times in the 20th century when such things occurred, and that is deliver justice to the perpetrator and bring a sense of peace to the victims\u2019 families. But 2016 has revealed that Roof is no longer an outlier, no longer on the fringe. The views that led him to pick up a gun \u2013 feeling aggrieved and supposedly left behind as a young white man \u2013 no doubt contributed to Donald Trump garnering enough support to make him our next president. That\u2019s why white nationalists are giddy and doing Nazi salutes in the name of Trump on video, why they see an affinity with him in a way they haven\u2019t seen from any other President-elect in modern times, Democrat or Republican.  I was hoping the Roof trial would take a backseat to Slager, that his name would soon be forgotten because the rest of us would have been so shocked, outraged, by what led him to that dastardly night during a Bible study, that we would declare with one voice: Never again. Instead, America has elevated his grievances and ushered them into the most powerful office in the land. That should grieve us all.",

John McWhorter: Liberals tend to focus on political correctness that affects people of color President-elect Trump won the votes of many whites who felt they were being stereotyped, he writes We wonder what the election of Donald Trump means for America. I suggest one thing it means is that educated Americans need to do a reset on what we mean by \u201cpolitically correct.\u201d We need a new PC. The simple fact is that a core constituency of white people just aren\u2019t going to \u201cget it\u201d the way the left wants them to. This is the case, for example, on race. The left wants white America to see itself as profoundly culpable, as the bad guy in the drama. For many black people, for instance, the very definition of black identity is enduring racist dismissal from whites. To claim that any other particular trait is \u201cblack\u201d is considered stereotyping, as we are to see black people as endlessly diverse. The one thing that doesn\u2019t count as a stereotype, which is thought to unite us all, is experiencing racism. Moreover, it is considered key to intellectual and moral engagement to be in eternal battle against the stain of racism in the American fabric. That is understandable in itself. But naturally it can be hard to be white under this analysis. (Note: anyone who thinks this editorial is a defense of racism will likely feel differently if they read to the end.) One likely tires of being endlessly assailed as complicit in sin. Indeed, many white people figure that they have gotten the message that they shouldn\u2019t stereotype, that black people have a lousy history, that a lot of people aren\u2019t free of racist bias. But white people feel like they aren\u2019t bad people, and are sick of being told that they are, no matter what they do. The idea that they are bearers of a \u201cwhite privilege\u201d for which they must endlessly apologize, no matter what they do or think, likely rankles especially. They feel damned if they do, damned if they don\u2019t. Cruz: Election was revenge of flyover country \u201cGood, that\u2019s the way they should feel!\u201d many will insist, white as well as black. But here is where November 8th comes in. There is so often a difference between what should be and what is, or ever will be. Namely, some whites are so resistant to conceiving of themselves as defined by bigotry that they are sticking up a middle finger at the whole business and cherishing their \u201cwhite identity.\u201d Others are less confrontational than this, but folks, let\u2019s face it \u2013 their vote for Trump shows that his bigotry and sexism was not a deal-breaker for them. It\u2019s surely relevant that many such people, as Arlie Hochschild has documented, feel as if the national conversation \u201cprivileges\u201d people of color over them despite their not having the easiest time in their own lives. Should Democrats cooperate with Trump? Now, whether these people are \u201cright\u201d is a complex issue, but more important is a simple question: can anyone change their minds? On the left, a healthy strain now wonders how we might \u201creach\u201d such people such that they wouldn\u2019t vote for someone like Trump again. But just how, beyond our gauzy hopes, were we hoping that might happen? It\u2019s time to admit and grapple with the fact that all of America will never be, as it were, PC in the sense cherished in liberal college towns. All of America will never see the present through the lens of the past, and will never entirely shed a tendency to stereotype. The left is seeking a vision of human empathy, historical awareness, and even concentration, that would be achievable only via submitting all citizens to a rigorous mental training akin to what we all recall from \u201cThe Karate Kid\u201d \u2013 or even \u201c1984.\u201d The time comes when it\u2019s time to admit that it ain\u2019t gonna happen. This Thanksgiving weekend, I'll be defending Trump to horrified liberals That time came the morning of November 9th, and it\u2019s time for a new conception of what is politically correct, that we can reasonably expect all people, of all levels, to get on board with. The idea is not to cease battling racism, but to do it in a way that we can reasonably expect a populace of human beings to understand. Herewith, a new PC \u2013 or, in current parlance, what it is to be \u201cwoke.\u201d It is \u201cwoke\u201d to understand that Trayvon Martin and so many other black people would be alive if they had been white. It is \u201cwoke\u201d to revile Republicans\u2019 attempt to disenfranchise as many black people as possible on the basis of a fallacious concern with virtually non-existent voter fraud. It is \u201cwoke\u201d to despise and prosecute whites who act out on their frustration with being called racists by becoming racists themselves and propagating hate crimes against minorities, as has been repugnantly common since Trump\u2019s election. Those who don\u2019t \u201cget\u201d these simple truths must be treated as requiring education, and we should stick at it.  However, there are things it\u2019s time to stop calling \u201cwoke.\u201d  In an America we can actually expect healing in, it will not be \u201cwoke\u201d to assail a white man wearing dreadlocks, or a gay white man adopting some slang expressions and gestures of black women, as committing the sin of cultural appropriation. It will not be \u201cwoke\u201d to call for reparations for abuses of black people committed eons ago, hoping that whites will cherish black Americans as human history\u2019s only people whose legacy permanently cripples them in the present. It will not be \u201cwoke\u201d for the media to treat the video of a white man nearly killed by black men as any less of a racially charged incident in the wake of Trump\u2019s victory, as if black people carry some kind of immunity to censure because of slavery and Jim Crow and redlining. Trump's shocking victory: What it means It will not be \u201cwoke\u201d to pillory people as racists for passingly infelicitous gestures, such as referring to black people as \u201ccolored people\u201d (like Good Morning America\u2019s Amy Robach did last summer), or photoshopping themselves riding on the back of a black athlete in praise of their accomplishment (Ellen DeGeneres and Usain Bolt), or showing blonde, white Khaleesi embraced by brown-skinned Dothrakis on Game of Thrones. I know the objections \u2013 \u201cDon\u2019t you understand that America was founded on racial hierarchy and even today remains predicated upon structural racism!!?\u201d\u2013 and I do understand. But we cannot make more than a hyper-educated sliver of white Americans see those facts as justifying a contemptuous view of themselves, or as justifying submitting black people to different standards of morality and expectation. How do I know? Donald Trump is our next president. We need new tactics.",

The views expressed are her own. Laura Coates: Sessions' appointment as AG is latest signal of an impending ideological shift President-Elect Trump's choice will roll back progress made under Holder and Lynch The inevitable confirmation of Sen. Jeff Sessions \u2013 Donald Trump\u2019s nominee to be attorney general as the successor of Eric Holder and Loretta Lynch, the first African-American male and female to hold that office, will slow, if not halt, the momentum gained during the last eight years to reform our criminal justice system. Holder and Lynch prioritized combating racial profiling and selective policing within communities of color. In a twist of fate, by contrast, Sen. Sessions\u2019 judicial appointment by President Reagan to the federal bench stalled in the Senate Judiciary Committee \u2013 the very committee on which Sessions now sits. Their refusal to confirm him was largely the result of a number of racially charged statements Sessions allegedly made in the 1980s. But a man who, because of those statements, was previously deemed unfit to preside over a court of law, may now preside over the Department of Justice, placing the future of any progress made on Holder\u2019s and Lynch\u2019s watch in doubt. Sessions\u2019 statements will most assuredly be used as Democratic fodder during his confirmation hearing. But with a Republican majority, the confirmation hearing will largely be a formality. His rhetoric will, however, have a big impact on minority perceptions of the prominent civil rights agenda of the Department of Justice, which has gained increased visibility and scrutiny in an era of publicized police shootings. Civil rights groups denounce Sessions as AG Under Attorneys General Holder and Lynch, the Department of Justice has made powerful strides to restore racial minorities\u2019 faith in the criminal justice system. They acted with an eye toward reversing the devastating impact that President Bill Clinton\u2019s omnibus crime bill had on communities of color, and reducing the astronomical incarceration rate that resulted from harsher penalties imposed for possession and distribution of crack cocaine (more prevalent in economically disadvantaged communities of color) than those imposed for powder cocaine (which was more prevalent within affluent white communities). Yet even under successive African-American attorneys general, the widely publicized use of excessive and deadly force by police officers against unarmed black men, and the seeming inability of local prosecutors to secure convictions against those officers, has all but depleted the faith of communities of color in the department\u2019s ability achieve its mission. Indeed, the Department of Justice\u2019s Civil Rights Division was intended to act as a backstop against failed state prosecutions and serve as a neutral advocate for communities who feared that the objectivity of local prosecutors would be compromised by personal relationships or prejudices. Sessions: Case of Central Park 5, later exonerated, shows Trump's dedication to 'law and order' But with each failure to indict, mistrial and acquittal, the department has been criticized for its lack of effectiveness to ensure justice for communities of color. Still, Holder and Lynch were vocal about their intolerance of civil rights violations. They were vocal even when they recognized the limitations on their ability to prosecute such violations under a body of Supreme Court precedent that is overwhelmingly deferential to police officers\u2019 assessment of the appropriate amount of force to use. The perception of a powerful and conscientious watchdog in the Justice Department\u2019s top job gave communities hope for the future and tempered the backlash in response to perceived miscarriages of justice. Surely Jeff Sessions, a man accused of calling prominent Civil Rights groups like the NAACP \u201cun-American,\u201d and condemning the Klu Klux Klan for supposed marijuana use (rather than its legacy of hate), will further undermine the African-American community\u2019s faith that his department will act in \u2013 let alone prioritize \u2013 the interests of communities of color.  But if the presidential election has taught us anything, it is that offensive rhetoric, perhaps even 30 years removed, may be wholly irrelevant to people who prioritize other issues more. Frankly, it remains to be seen what types of criminal prosecutions Sen. Sessions will indeed prioritize, but he has already shown his hand as a political operator.  Remember when then-candidate Trump promised to instruct his attorney general to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate Democratic Presidential nominee Hillary Clinton? Sen. Sessions has already called for a deeper investigation into the Clinton Foundation. Attorney General Sessions would have prosecutorial power.  More than anything, Sessions\u2019 appointment is an obvious forecast of the impending ideological shift across multiple branches of government. With one Supreme Court vacancy in hand, and perhaps another two in the bush, Sessions\u2019 nomination signals that President-elect Trump is prioritizing a reversion back to a time when America, and its justice system, was \u201cgreat.\u201d Sen. Session reiterated that same message on Trump\u2019s campaign trail.  When it comes to prosecuting civil rights violations, let\u2019s hope Sen. Sessions\u2019 reference point of greatness is at least in this century.",

She is also the author of Feminism and Pop Culture and We Were Feminists Once. The views expressed here are hers. Andi Zeisler: After Brock Turner, Bill Cosby, and Donald Trump, \"Sweet/Vicious\" strikes a chord Questioning male entitlement is still a taboo, but more women are doing it, she says In the cold opening to \u201cSweet/Vicious,\u201d MTV\u2019s new series about two young women meting out vigilante justice to predators, a masked, ninjalike figure shimmies up a trellis, slips into a fraternity-house room, and strikes. \u201cSay her name,\u201d demands an artifically disguised voice, as the intruder shoves a cell-phone photo of a young woman toward a young man\u2019s face. As he quakes, the voice asks, \u201cAre you scared, Will? You feel powerless? Do I have consent, Will?\u201d A few strategic blows to the face induce the frat boy to admit his crime, and the figure stands to leave \u2014 but not quite yet. \u201cIf you ever do to anyone else what you did to Beth\u2026I will be back,\u201d the figure says, punctuating the warning by burying a knife in the rapist\u2019s leg and slipping back out the window. In a few minutes\u2019 time, the black mask is gone and we meet Jules, sorority girl-turned-campus avenger. The series, created by Jennifer Kaytin Robinson and set at the fictional Darlington University, premiered a week after the 2016 election,  and comes along at a great time. After all, we\u2019ve somehow just elected a president who has spent most of his life in the public eye, demonstrating how little he values women\u2019s humanity, and who all but corroborated sexual-assault allegations against him by bragging that, as a rich and famous man, he could \u201cgrab [women] by the pussy,\u201d with zero consequences. Amid the instant flood of accounts of hate speech, swastika grafitti, and assaults on Muslim and black citizens, reports are coming in from women around the country who have been sexually harassed and groped by men who tell them with glee and menace that they live in Trump\u2019s America now. Did I say it\u2019s a good time for this show? Correction: It\u2019s the perfect time. How I stopped my state from giving parental rights to rapists Election Day notwithstanding, the past several years have brought some progress in how we as a culture discuss the issues of sexual consent and violence. Long-rumored abuses perpetrated by famous men \u2014 among them Bill Cosby and Canadian broadcast personality Jian Ghomeshi \u2014 were pushed out into the open. The case of Brock Turner, the Stanford student given a laughably brief sentence for a clear-cut case of rape, as well as that of the high-school athletes in Steubenville, Ohio, went scorchingly viral. The Obama administation launched It\u2019s On Us, a nationwide awareness program dedicated to addressing and combating sexual violence on college campuses. California, New York, and Michigan adopted affirmative-consent \u2014 also known as \u201cyes means yes\u201d\u2014 laws that mandate teaching that nothing short of a vocal \u201cyes\u201d counts as consent. In interviews, CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper used and placed emphasis on the phrase \u201csexual assault\u201d \u2014 as in, it\u2019s not just \u201clocker-room talk\u201d \u2014 to name the behavior Donald Trump boasted about on a hot mic. However, the fact that more than a few people are angry that this dialogue has evolved \u2014 say, the people who scoff at affirmative-consent laws as \u201csex policing\u201d \u2014 is perhaps more telling than the evolution itself. Entitlement to female attention and bodies, is, as Trump so crassly noted, one of the long-guaranteed spoils of success, whether in college athletics or Hollywood or high-flying global real estate. Questioning that \u2014 or, worse, fighting against it \u2014 is still a taboo. Women continue to live and work alongside their attackers because telling the truth often means opening up a world of further torment. Why reporting on sexual assault is a good thing It\u2019s this reality that \u201cSweet/Vicious\u201d takes aim at. Jules can\u2019t yet avenge her own rape \u2014 the perpetrator is her best friend\u2019s boyfriend \u2014 but she and Ophelia, the trust-fund hacker who cracks her secret identity and joins the cause, can act on behalf of women who aren\u2019t taken seriously by police, whose cases have been dismissed by the college, who have learned that the system that should protect them won\u2019t. People will probably be angry at \u201cSweet/Vicious,\u201d too. When it comes to female vigilantes, audiences \u2014 when they like them at all \u2014 like them ravished as graphically as possible before they get their revenge, if precursors like \u201cI Spit on Your Grave,\u201d \u201cMs. 45,\u201d and \u201cIrreversible\u201d are any indication. (Though the show\u2019s wry humor also recalls the movie \u201cThelma and Louise,\u201d as well as the quieter \u201990s indie \u201cGirls Town.\u201d) What Jules and Ophelia offer is a more literal version of the terrible sisterhood so often forged among campus victims, who furtively scrawl their attackers\u2019 names on bathroom walls as a warning to other women, but who may never meet or talk to those women. The two are the quirky-white-girl version of an odd couple: Scholarship student Jules scrambles to fit class and sorority events into her ass-kicking schedule while Ophelia deals weed from her record-store job and sleeps until 3pm. Their first moment of solidarity is slapstick \u2014 they belt out Wicked\u2019s \u201cDefying Gravity\u201d while a dead rapist decomposes in the trunk of Ophelia\u2019s car \u2014 but pointed: These are not superheroines, they\u2019re flawed young women navigating a brutal, entrenched system of expectations and assumptions perpetuated by men and women alike.  As vigilante fantasy, \u201cSweet/Vicious\u201d can be deeply satisfying, and with subplots that tackle racial profiling and Greek-system hazing, the show stands to complicate the straightforward good girl/evil guy binary. But if viewers are unsettled or disturbed by the prospect of young women forcing sexual predators to reckon with the often casual, unthinking privilege with which they approach their victims (it\u2019s notable that in the opening scene, Jules\u2019s frat-boy prey blurts out that he \u201cdidn\u2019t meant to hurt anybody\u201d), perhaps they should be. Pop culture, media, and real life have for decades told too many women that the harm perpetrated on them doesn\u2019t \u201ccount,\u201d doesn\u2019t matter. After eight years with a President who addressed sexual violence straight-on, American women are now faced with a President who brags about \u201cgetting away\u201d with it. In a time when threats to rights, liberties, and bodily autonomy have quickly escalated, don\u2019t be surprised when women don\u2019t sit quietly and hope for the best.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Brian Hughes is a professor of media studies at Queens College, City University of New York. He writes and researches on the topics of extremism, new media and the Middle East. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his. Brian Hughes: Make no mistake. Fake news is a problem The solution to this problem isn't less content, writes Hughes, it's better curation Can tall tales swing an election? That\u2019s the question being asked today in conference rooms across the digital media industry. After Donald Trump\u2019s startling presidential victory, many are wondering if an abundance of misleading or simply made up news stories gave President-elect Trump the edge he needed to win. Critics are calling on media companies to regulate the spread of phony news reports. Already, platforms like Facebook and Google have announced plans to curtail fake news by revising their algorithms and user policies. But will such changes really improve the trustworthiness of online news? First, some perspective: The 2016 election was a stunningly low-turnout race, which ended in an ambiguous, electoral-but-not-popular victory for President-elect Trump. Fake news may have been, at most, a necessary but insufficient cause for the election\u2019s outcome. Take away one FBI press conference, or add a last-minute Clinton rally in Wisconsin, and things might have gone very differently. If fake news did move the needle in Trump\u2019s favor, it was only one of many factors affecting the outcome of a race between two of the least popular candidates of all time. Where Donald Trump got his real power Make no mistake. Fake news is a problem. The next Democratic challenger will have to contend with fake news, as will subsequent Republicans and independents. And when even Macedonian teenagers are getting in on this racket, you can be sure it\u2019s not going away. Fake news presents a profound challenge that transcends ideology, striking at the core of representative democracy: a sober, informed electorate. Something does need be done. But it would be a mistake to pressure Facebook and Google into acting as censors. We\u2019ve already seen how such an approach can backfire. Manipulation, such as Facebook altering its Trending Newsfeed to hide conservative sources, only leads to higher levels of public distrust. That in turn empowers purveyors of fake news. If users feel they are being denied relevant (or juicy) content, they will simply seek it out from sites with no such editorial standards. The solution to this problem isn\u2019t less content; it\u2019s better curation. In the 1950s, the FCC regulated the television industry with a program it called the \u201cFairness Doctrine.\u201d The thinking went like this: With only three networks to choose from, viewers needed reliably balanced news and opinion. So, if a television station aired one perspective on a controversial topic, it was obliged to air an opposing view. That Trump quote calling Republicans 'the dumbest group of voters'? Fake! As a country, we should look at the possibility of adopting a digital equivalent to the Fairness Doctrine. Social media like Facebook work best when they\u2019re effectively monopolies. So do companies like Google, which depend on collecting user data to target search results and advertising. It\u2019s called the network effect: The more people who use a social network, the more indispensable it becomes. Big Data analytics like Facebook\u2019s social graph are notorious for their ability to identify consumer niches. It should therefore be possible to individually program our news feeds for balance and accuracy. If services like Facebook and Google are allowed to become news-aggregating monopolies, it\u2019s only reasonable to expect them to serve the public good as well as the bottom line.  After an election this contentious, some partisan second-guessing is to be expected. But the problem of fake news goes beyond Democrats wondering what might have been. Fake news pours gasoline on a country already inflamed with political and even ethnic and racial hostilities. The last thing we need going into the next four years is more confusion and misunderstanding. It might not be Facebook or Google\u2019s fault that we\u2019re in this mess, but they are uniquely positioned to help us get out of it.",

She is also an adjunct professor in the College of Business and Mass Communication at Brenau University in Gainesville, Georgia. Shelbayah frequently speaks on topics such as international communication, Islam, culture and leadership. The opinions expressed in this commentary are hers. Slma Shelbayah: I wear a headscarf to support diversity; since presidential election, I don't feel safe to do so She says it's the obligation of the incoming President Trump to push back at hate and embrace the diversity of America Over the presidential campaign and in the heated days after the election, I\u2019ve seen report after report of racist incidents and hate crimes. It seems as though the fear-mongering rhetoric used throughout the campaign may have given a free ticket to those ready to act with hate. Ana Navarro: Trump 'unleashed' feelings of racism Some of the stories have touched me on an even more personal level, like seeing stories of Muslim women being insulted or attacked for wearing headscarves.  That some women must fear for their safety in America because of a personal choice they make when getting dressed absolutely baffles me.  They are being forced to conform. How can some people be so hateful to attack others with such confidence and not consider the consequences? This issue rocks me to my core for two reasons: The first? Nearly a year ago I wrote a commentary in these pages about removing my hijab to find myself.  I decided to wear it only part time, and then, after experimenting with it, chose to keep it on full time.  What is hijab? A scarf \u2013 a simple piece of material in many sizes, shapes and colors wrapped over a Muslim woman\u2019s head. While for most people the reason to cover may be religious, mine is primarily social. I choose to wear a hijab as a symbolic expression of diversity in society. I exercise my freedom without fear or influence. Woman in hijab forced to leave Trump event Really: what\u2019s the big deal? It\u2019s literally just another piece of clothing. But for various reasons, some people try to define it in black or white terms. The reality is that it stands for many things related to fashion, religion, politics and society. It\u2019s personal and intimate. It is a woman\u2019s choice: what to wear or not wear, an exercise of her preference. In America, I am free to wear it as I please. But the freedom feels threatened in a Trump America. Keeping a hijab on may potentially cost me my safety and endanger my young daughters. I find myself worried about every trip I take outdoors with them. Thoughts of being attacked or putting my girls in harm\u2019s way fill my head. I wonder: Is it just safer to take it off again so I don\u2019t \u201clook\u201d Muslim? My faith whispers to keep it on in defiance of fear \u2014 and in my conviction that diversity is a right and a strength in this country. 'Make America White Again': Hate speech and crimes post-election And the second reason for my alarm? My older daughter voluntarily shares with just about anyone that she is of Turkish, Egyptian, Pakistani and Indian descent, adding that her ultimate pride is in being American and Muslim. Since her toddler years, she has seen her cultural background as one of the most exciting aspects of her life. I teach both my girls to embrace diversity and cherish it in others. They have traveled to many countries and are aware of the complex world around them. I have raised them to honor everyone for their unique differences. Now, it seems everything I\u2019ve taught my daughters about diversity as empowerment has been challenged. I am having to explain the intolerance and hate that surfaced in our nation during the presidential campaign, and seems to be erupting anew since the election. My girls have questions about the spiteful rhetoric they overhear, despite my efforts to protect them from it. They even asked me if news of a Muslim ban was true and if our family will have a place to live. Trump's failure on 'heeby jobbies' Suddenly, I find myself needing to prepare them for another life lesson: Honoring diversity in others does not guarantee the same in return. But there is more: Openly threatening a woman if she does not remove an article of clothing and further taking action by touching that woman is a violation \u2014 an assault. And as Americans who stand for the rights and freedoms of all, we cannot condone assault, regardless of which side of the political spectrum we may lean. No one should contemplate hiding their way into safety by changing the way they look or dress.  And it is not only Muslims in headscarves: Other minorities find themselves looking for ways to fit in while maintaining their identities and staying safe. At least I can remove a scarf from my head; others cannot change their skin color or features to hide their way into safety. First U.S. Olympic Muslim athlete to wear a hijab America, we are bigger and better than the few among us who choose to act out of fear rather than love. The America I know is not limited to certain beliefs, it is inclusive of our uniqueness. It has space for all of us. We cannot allow hateful speech or differences to divide us. We cannot allow divisiveness to drive us into a fall. We must stand up for ourselves and for our fellow Americans. We must remain united. This is not a matter of religious choice, it\u2019s the duty of each of us to ensure and protect the same rights for others that we want granted to ourselves. And this brings me to our President-elect, Donald Trump, for whom I have a message:  The people have elected you to become the next President of the greatest nation in the world. We have heard you speak numerous times throughout the campaign about your plans to protect our citizens from the dangers in the world. Thank you for having the passionate desire to keep us safe. But consider this: Security begins at home. Allowing division over differences can lead to hateful crimes, racial slurs and intolerance, and makes Americans less safe. Shortly after you won the election, you stated you would be president to all Americans. In an interview on TV the other night, you even looked into the camera and told your supporters to stop harassing minorities. \u201cStop it,\u201d you said. I am counting on you to mean it. We need to hear, expressed as loudly as during the campaign, that you believe this country is for ALL Americans. Reassure us that our nation will no longer be motivated by fear and that it will come together as one full of a diversity that is respected and embraced. We want you to use your rhetoric. Use your resources. Tweet us messages of tolerance and unity. I, along with my daughters and all other Americans who value the freedoms and justice afforded to us, anticipate you will start with making America great at home first.  The America that we know stands for liberty and justice for all, so that none of us have to ever contemplate the way I am right now, trading our free choice for safety.

The post-election coverage has largely ignored the reactions of one segment of American society: people of color Issac Bailey: People of color are a resilient group, but don't expect them to grin and bear the abuse they've taken I noticed the waiter lingering around my table a little more than usual. For the first time at this buffet-style restaurant, the waiter seemed agitated. Normally, he would be singing to mesmerized patrons in between busing tables and asking if customers needed any assistance in a place that is essentially self-serve. \u201cThat man called me boy,\u201d he finally told me, unprompted, while pointing his eyes toward an older white gentleman in blue overalls. \u201cHe said, \u2018boy, go get me some sweet tea,\u2019\u201d the waiter went on, mostly under his breath. He didn\u2019t want anyone else to hear. \u201cI\u2019m a man! I\u2019m a father,\u201d he told me. I could see that he was fighting back tears and the urge to show that man, in no uncertain terms, that he was no one\u2019s boy. The waiter, a black man in his 30s, told his white supervisor about the incident but was told to just ignore it, that maybe the man didn\u2019t mean any harm. But he couldn\u2019t \u2013 it hurt too much \u2013 and that\u2019s why he was standing at my table, commiserating with the only other black person in the restaurant. He had no other option. He couldn\u2019t confront the man directly without the potential of being called overly sensitive or, worse yet, losing his job.  I left him a larger-than-usual tip in hopes that gesture might provide some respite in an untenable situation. He needed the job. But he needed his dignity, too. He struggled, and in the end did what many had done before him \u2013 swallowed hard and got back to work. That was a few months ago. His was one of many stories that came back to me after election night, because it is illustrative of what many people of color are feeling as the words \u201cPresident-elect Donald Trump\u201d seep into their consciousness. While much of the media has been focused on what motivated Trump voters, particularly struggling whites \u2013 was it economic angst or racial animus? \u2013 little attention has been paid to the toll this election has taken on people of color. Just as that waiter\u2019s white supervisor told him to ignore what he was feeling, the media and many white voters have essentially told people of color to ignore the horror they haven\u2019t yet been able to shake. And just like that black waiter, people of color are forced to find a way to deal with this new reality while trying to maintain their dignity. They don\u2019t have any good options. They are told to not be bothered by the realization that many of their white friends, associates and colleagues \u2013 in the form of white voters \u2013 were as undisturbed by Trump\u2019s open bigotry as that waiter\u2019s supervisor, who was not concerned by the white man calling his employee boy, a term once routinely used to intimidate and demean black people in the Jim Crow South. Reports of racism, bigotry post-election They are asked to ignore what was revealed during this election cycle, to peacefully accept the results and give the new guy a chance. They are told to do this for a man who, in many respects, spent his campaign demeaning people of color in the way that black waiter felt demeaned after being called boy. That came on the heels of Trump having spent years doing the same to the nation\u2019s first black president through a birther movement that had nearly three-quarters of Republicans doubting that Barack Obama was born in this country. People of color will find a way to get through, will find a way to reconcile the casualness with which many of their white friends and colleagues ignored an open bigotry and maintain the love and respect they\u2019ve had for those people. They always do. They have decades of practice in a country that is sometimes threatened by their skin color, other times by their burgeoning success.  But don\u2019t expect them to just grin and bear it this time. That anger can\u2019t simply be wiped away by a new, softer tone from the President-elect. And it will not dissipate because Obama is reminding his supporters, like he did in his first post-election news conference Monday, that in a democracy things don\u2019t always go our way and that we must make the transition of power as smooth as possible, no matter who we voted for or against. The struggling white Americans who chose Trump have neither faced struggle as deep nor as long as people of color, yet their personal struggles are pointed to as an excuse for voting for a man either because of or despite his bigotry. When will people of color get a similar pass for where their anger might lead them?",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Austin Sarat is the William Nelson Cromwell Professor of Jurisprudence and Political Science at Amherst College and author of \u201cGruesome Spectacles: Botched Executions and America\u2019s Death Penalty.\u201d The opinions expressed in this commentary are those of the author. Austin Sarat: Last week's election gave hope to death penalty proponents Balloting in California, Oklahoma, and Nebraska and the election of Donald Trump seem to foretell a comeback of capital punishment, but Sarat writes that it's not that simple Executions and capital punishment sentences are both declining, he says After years of declining use of the death penalty across the United States and declining public support for capital punishment, last week\u2019s election gave hope to death penalty proponents. The results of balloting in California, Oklahoma and Nebraska as well as the election of Donald Trump seem to foretell a comeback of capital punishment. Yet the foundations of the case against capital punishment remain strong and the likelihood of continuing progress toward abolishing the death penalty remains great. For supporters of capital punishment the most consequential development was the election of Donald Trump. Trump is such a vocal and enthusiastic supporter of capital punishment that, in December of 2015, he promised members of the New England Police Benevolent Association that he would issue an executive order as president containing the \u201cstrong, strong statement\u201d that he wants the death penalty for those found guilty of killing a police officer. \u201cAnybody,\u201d Trump said, \u201ckilling a policeman, a policewoman, a police officer, anybody killing a police officer: Death penalty is going to happen, okay?\u201d Trump\u2019s election is likely to put on hold any prospect that the Supreme Court will take up Justice Stephen Breyer\u2019s recent invitation to his fellow justices to reconsider the constitutionality of capital punishment. The results of referendum questions on the ballot in California, Nebraska and Oklahoma also brought bad news for abolitionists. Voters in California delivered a double-barreled blow. They rejected Proposition 62, a measure which would have replaced capital punishment for murder with life in prison without parole. They also approved by a narrow margin a separate measure intended to speed up executions. That measure designates special courts to hear challenges to death penalty convictions, limits successive appeals and expands the pool of lawyers who could handle those appeals. Nebraska voters, by a margin of 61% to 39%, approved reinstating that state\u2019s death penalty one year after state legislators voted to abolish it.  In Oklahoma, 66% of voters supported State Question 776 declaring that the death penalty cannot be considered cruel and unusual under the state constitution. It added a provision that \u201cany method of execution shall be allowed, unless prohibited by the United States Constitution.\u201d Despite these electoral victories, the likelihood of a reversal of fortune for capital punishment is remote. The high costs of capital prosecutions, serious doubts about the reliability of capital convictions, concerns about arbitrariness in death sentencing, and the difficulty of finding reliable methods of execution remain. These issues have allowed death penalty opponents to build their case state by state, appealing to public officials and offering them a different way to frame opposition to capital punishment. Over the last decade, that strategy has led to judicial or legislative abolition in New York, New Jersey, New Mexico, Illinois, Connecticut, Maryland, Nebraska (a decision reversed by Tuesday\u2019s referendum) and Delaware. Its success can also be seen in the dramatic drop in the number of death sentences handed out across the United States. They have been cut from 315 in 1996 to 49 in 2015. The number of executions also has declined significantly, going from 98 in 1999 to 28 last year. These changes have occurred because abolitionists have reframed the way many judges, legislatures, and governors think about capital punishment. The focus of political and legal debates has moved from moral and philosophical abstractions toward a careful consideration of the way the death penalty works in practice. Even after the recent election, public officials can continue to oppose the death penalty by questioning whether its day-to-day practices are compatible with central American values, like due process and equal treatment. As former Illinois Gov. Pat Quinn explained in 2011 when he signed a bill to end the death penalty, \u201cI have concluded that our system of imposing the death penalty is inherently flawed. Since our experience has shown that there is no way to design a perfect death penalty system, free from the numerous flaws that can lead to wrongful convictions or discriminatory treatment, I have concluded that the proper course of action is to abolish it.\u201d While they did not persuade the citizens of California, Nebraska or Oklahoma, opponents of the death penalty have made substantial progress with the American public. A 2015 national survey conducted by the Pew Research Center found that 71% of Americans believed that there is some risk that an innocent person will be put to death and only 26% thought that there are adequate safeguards in place to make sure that does not happen. That same survey found that 52% of respondents agreed that minorities are more likely than whites to be sentenced to death for similar crimes.  Because of these concerns about the risk of executing the innocent and about racial discrimination in capital sentencing, 42% of the public now opposes the death penalty, the highest such opposition has been since 1972. Last week\u2019s electoral results are a reminder that the death penalty continues to have powerful populist and symbolic appeal, but it does not foretell a comeback for capital punishment. Abolitionists will remain on the offensive, and America still seems to be on the road to abolition.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Stephanie Coontz is director of research at the Council on Contemporary Families and teaches history at Evergreen State College in Olympia, Washington. Her most recent book is \u201cA Strange Stirring: The Feminine Mystique and American Women at the Dawn of the 1960s.\u201d She is also the author of \u201cThe Way We Never Were: American Families and the Nostalgia Trap.\u201d This was Hillary Clinton's election to lose, says Stephanie Coontz Democrat was unable to convince voters she was a defender of those left behind, Coontz says Since the presidential election, pundits have struggled to explain Donald Trump\u2019s upset win. Liberal columnists are united in shock that so many people voted for a man who inflamed racial, ethnic and religious tensions, insulted and mistreated women, and was deemed temperamentally unfit to be president, even by many of his supporters. Conservatives are divided. Conservative columnist Ross Douthat bemoans the \u201ccrude genius\u201d that has brought America to the brink of \u201ccatastrophe.\u201d House Speaker Paul Ryan, who repeatedly denounced Trump during the campaign, now hails Trump\u2019s election as a sign that Americans have repudiated \u201cfailed liberal progressive policies.\u201d But the biggest debates swirl around Trump\u2019s appeal to working-class whites. And this appeal represents something far more complicated than either side admits. Contrary to Ryan, Trump\u2019s working-class and rural supporters don\u2019t endorse most traditional Republican alternatives to progressive policies. In fact, polls consistently show that they oppose free trade, mistrust corporations and banks, and oppose cutting Medicare or Social Security. They largely account for the substantial portion of Republican voters \u2013 almost 30% \u2013 who say they would support \u201cheavy\u201d taxes on the wealthy. Listen to how the first policy statement in Trump\u2019s victory speech Wednesday morning echoed the progressive agenda that Bernie Sanders and Elizabeth Warren have championed, embellished with a typical Trumpian flourish: \u201cWe are going to fix our inner cities and rebuild our highways, bridges, tunnels, airports, schools, hospitals. We\u2019re going to rebuild our infrastructure, which will become, by the way, second to none. And we will put millions of our people to work as we rebuild it.\u201d  Liberals explanations for the Clinton loss are also incomplete. Yes, racism, sexism, and nativism are widespread, and the right wing has demonized Hillary Clinton for years. But ultimately, this was Clinton\u2019s election to lose, and Democratic Party officials should reflect on their eagerness to nominate her in the first place, despite the clear longing of so many young liberals and older conservatives for an anti-establishment figure motivated by more palpable indignation against \u201cthe system.\u201d What\u2019s more, Trump\u2019s dog-whistle appeals to racism were not the only reason Clinton failed among white voters without a college education. The last time around, these voters comprised more than one third of the Americans who voted for Obama. But Clinton failed to duplicate that success in any state that was up for grabs in this election. In one Ohio county where President Obama won by a 22-point margin just four years ago, Trump defeated Clinton by six points. So what\u2019s going on with these voters? Muslims fearful of a Trump presidency As a recent CNN poll shows, white working-class and rural voters without a college degree are not the poorest of Americans, but they are the most pessimistic about their future prospects.  A full half expect their children\u2019s lives will be worse than their own, and less than a quarter expect their children to do better. In stark contrast to blacks and Hispanics without a college education, most don\u2019t believe they would be better off if they had earned a four-year college degree. Clinton\u2019s promise of free college didn\u2019t resonate with them. What they want is what they used to have: predictable jobs and long-standing social networks in stable communities. As liberals note, the social networks in which they were embedded reflected strict racial and gender hierarchies and enforced a conformity to community norms that was very painful for gays and lesbians, political dissidents and women who dreamed of doing something in the world outside the home. But they provided a stability that has since disappeared. In the 1950s and 1960s, young people didn\u2019t have to leave for college, move to another state, or join the military, putting their lives at risk (in sharp contrast to most of their more educated or affluent fellow Americans), in order to find a job that paid enough to raise a family. Businesses didn\u2019t demand tax breaks from their towns and then move away as soon as the tax break expired. Your kids could follow in your footsteps and do better than you, just as you had done better than your own parents. Are Trump businesses a potential conflict of interest? Since that time, however, working families have experienced downsizing, outsourcing, and the relentless destruction of middle-wage jobs, with their reinvention as lower-wage jobs. They lost homes or home values in the deepest recession since the Great Depression and have since watched a \u201crecovery\u201d that has mainly benefited wealthy urbanites. A 2014 study prepared for the US Conference of Mayors and the Council on Metro Economics and the New American City found that over the last 40 years, the distribution of income has steadily shifted toward upper-income households, while jobs recovered after the 2008 recession paid an average of 23% less than the positions they replaced. Another study by the National Employment Law Project  found that by 2014 there were 958,000 fewer jobs in mid-wage industries and 1.85 million more workers in low-wage industries than at the start of the recession. Here\u2019s one concrete reason why so many working-class voters, unlike most of Clinton\u2019s educated supporters, don\u2019t think America\u2019s best days lie ahead. Between 1947 and 1979, real wages for an average meatpacking worker, adjusted for inflation, increased by around 80%, reaching almost $40,000 per year, a salary that could support a comfortable middle-class lifestyle. But between 1979 and 2012, the average meat packer\u2019s wage declined by nearly 30 percent, to about $27,000. Priebus: Republicans will act on campaign promises Clinton seemed oblivious to facts like these. As a historian who has studied the rise and decline of working-class families since World War II, I listened to Hillary Clinton\u2019s speeches over the last few months, looking in vain for any sign that she grasped the mounting frustration that so many working people have felt over the past few decades. While Trump talked about \u201cthe working class,\u201d she carefully focused on \u201cthe middle class.\u201d She mentioned tuition breaks and family friendly work places far more often than she talked about investment in infrastructure and jobs. Furthermore, despite my contempt for Trump\u2019s constant lies and self-aggrandizement, I understand why people who have felt trampled on by \u201cthe system\u201d for many years had trouble making meaningful distinctions between the respective vices of these two candidates. Trump made things up. But Clinton kept things quiet, including the cozy and well-paid meetings that financial interests arranged for her. He lied; she stonewalled. The reporter who knew Trump would win Clinton was quick to point out that Trump\u2019s father gave him a big pile of money to start his supposedly \u201cself-made\u201d business. But she and her husband financed daughter Chelsea\u2019s $3 million dollar wedding, and it\u2019s doubtful Chelsea would have landed a $600,000 a year job her first year after leaving school without those parental connections. Trump made his fortune manipulating tax laws and stiffing small businessmen, creating a few well-paying jobs along the way. Vulnerable people looking to master \u201cthe art of the deal\u201d learned the hard way that Trump held all the cards. The Clintons were nowhere near so crude. They made their considerable fortune from profitable book deals and wildly-lucrative speaking engagements. They didn\u2019t need to stiff anyone. But neither did their activities generate many jobs. Clinton spent more campaign time calling out Trump as a bully than presenting her own program for working-class renewal. But for many working-class Americans, that is one of his attractions. Throughout history, people with few educational or economic resources and little bargaining power have often looked to authoritarian, ruthless people to stand up for them.  As one of Trump\u2019s female supporters explained to a reporter, Trump is the kind of bully you get to beat up the people who have bullied you. Clinton was clearly the more competent candidate, but when her campaign ridiculed Trump, it merely proved to many Americans who also felt disrespected by the establishment that he was an outsider who understood their feelings of exclusion. She was simply unable to present herself as a forceful defender of everyone who has been left behind by the march of globalization, professionalization and the emergence of a new just-in-time, winner-take-all economy. For the past seven months, I have been commuting back and forth to New Orleans for family reasons, and Wednesday morning as I walked into the hotel lobby I wondered if I would be greeted by boisterous celebrations of Trump\u2019s victory. Instead, the first words I heard were from a white waitress, who later confirmed that she had never gone to college, with whom I had idly chatted over the past few days. \u201cBernie would have beaten Trump in all those swing states, just like he beat Hillary in many of them,\u201d she announced. Later, a desk clerk mentioned that her uncle had voted for Bernie Sanders in the primaries but for Trump in the final election. Perhaps Sanders would have driven more middle-class voters into Trump\u2019s arms than any working-class ones he pulled away from Trump. But as these comments suggest, Democratic legislators need to devise ways to address the legitimate grievances of white working-class Americans without abandoning their defense of the minorities, women, and gay and lesbian Americans who are likely to face intensified discrimination under this administration. As for Republican legislators, it is time for any of them sane enough to believe the scientific evidence of climate change to become brave enough to help protect their working-class constituencies from its effects.",

Ellis is the author of many works of American history, including the Pulitzer Prize winner \u201cFounding Brothers: The Revolutionary Generation\u201d and \u201cAmerican Sphinx: The Character of Thomas Jefferson,\u201d which won the National Book Award. His most recent book, \u201cThe Quartet: Orchestrating the Second American Revolution,\u201d is out in paperback from Vintage Books. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. Joseph J. Ellis: Martin Luther King Jr. said the arc of moral universe bends towards justice Trump a reminder that King's racial rainbow is an arc that still lies beyond horizon, he says The Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. liked to claim that the arc of the moral universe bends towards justice. Over the long span of America\u2019s often-racist history, you can make the case that King was right, but each lurch forward generates a reaction, transforming the arc into a sine curve. Just as the end of slavery in the Southern states after the Civil War and Reconstruction produced the Jim Crow era, the election of the first black president has now produced the election of Donald Trump. The United States has entered another backlash chapter, and we can probably expect more of them to occur over succeeding decades as we approach the demographic fault line where whites become a statistical minority in this country. There were, to be sure, factors other than race at play in the election. Historically, it is difficult for a two-term president to be succeeded by a candidate from his own party. It has happened only twice before, in 1836 (Andrew Jackson-Martin Van Buren) and 1988 (Ronald Reagan-George H.W. Bush). Media coverage of the campaign, driven by an entertainment agenda, abandoned any journalistic responsibility to serve the public interest and thereby enabled the most unqualified presidential candidate in American history to evade exposure. It is also difficult to know how many voters found it impossible to endorse a woman president, especially when she carried political baggage that gave misogyny an easy outlet. Finally, globalization and technology have left large segments of the working class behind, and this election became a catharsis and Trump the vessel into which they poured their hopes for salvation. Anti-Trump protests continue across the US But race was the deepest and defining issue of this campaign. It was the coded message in Trump\u2019s slogan \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d embodied in his stigmatizing of Hispanics as rapists and Muslims as likely terrorists, his dog whistles to white supremacists, his mainstreaming of blatantly racist language previously confined to the margins of American society and last heard at the national level in George Wallace\u2019s segregationist campaign in 1968. White males, especially those from rural regions without college degrees, are the core of Trump\u2019s constituency. They have been the centerpiece of the Republican coalition since the civil rights movement drove them out of the Democratic Party. Trump mobilized them more effectively than ever before by making more explicit appeals to their prejudices. Race also explains one of the otherwise confounding contradictions that Thomas Frank first diagnosed in \u201cWhat\u2019s the Matter with Kansas?\u201d; namely the way so many working-class whites who stand to benefit from government programs such as the Affordable Care Act and more progressive tax policies vote against their own economic interest by resolutely opposing all such federal initiatives. The reason is that race trumps(!) class in their cultural calculations since any government policy that redistributes resources across the population disproportionately benefits blacks and Hispanics, an outcome they find intolerable. Trump\u2019s most ardent supporters are likely to suffer if and when he dismantles the Affordable Care Act, implements his tax cuts for the wealthy and initiates a trade war with China, but they are unlikely to make the connection. Hillary Clinton was wrong to call them \u201cdeplorables,\u201d but they do occupy a mental universe that lies beyond rational analysis. Muslims concerned, resilient after Trump victory Despite the unquestioned gains of the civil rights movement, which made outright expressions of racism politically taboo, Trump\u2019s election has exposed the abiding existence of a deep pool of racial prejudice beneath the surface of American society. It has been there throughout our history, and each time we move closer to a genuinely multiracial version of the American Dream, it bubbles back to the surface. Trump tapped into it with great rhetorical dexterity, thereby reminding us that King\u2019s racial rainbow is an arc that still lies beyond the horizon.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Jonathan Tasini (@jonathantasini) has been a frequent commentator on CNN and is a Bernie Sanders supporter. He is the author of \u201cThe Essential Bernie Sanders and His Vision for America,\u201d president of the Economic Future Group and the host of the Working Life podcast. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. Jonathan Tasini: There is only one silver lining in yesterday's election results. Tasini: We can now launch a difficult but urgent mission \u2014 the remaking of the Democratic Party. There is only one silver lining in yesterday\u2019s election results, which will allow a con man, a pathological liar, a bold racist and a sexual predator to succeed the first African-American president. We can now launch a difficult but urgent mission \u2014 shaking the Democratic Party down to its foundation, ejecting the failed Bill/Hillary Clinton economic and global worldview and standing up for a set of populist, sound economic and foreign policy principles that could earn majority support. On the surface, it\u2019s astounding that a man who ripped off thousands of people who worked for him became the champion of the regular Joe. But, as Bernie Sanders reiterated in a recent podcast with me, the problem is that people have ceased to see a difference between the parties, particularly on economic issues. I\u2019ll briefly cite a few examples. Starting out with NAFTA, Bill Clinton forced \u201cfree trade\u201d upon the party. I warned multiple times during the election that Trump would make inroads with voters in the Rust Belt unless Democrats made a clean break from corporate trade deals. Around the globe, these deals are a key tool to drive down wages, exploit workers and prosecute global class warfare. But, the current president still serves up the malarkey about the benefits of these deals. Bill Clinton\u2019s broader economic agenda was even more corrosive. During Clinton\u2019s so-called \u201cgood economy,\u201d the decline of organized labor continued. The president, and his secretary of labor, Robert Reich, did very little to arrest the decline. No Democratic president was more focused on letting business interests off the leash. He gave more power to media companies, triggering consolidation and a powerful wave of concentration of the media into a few hands. The average person, not steeped in policy, understood this every time he or she opened their skyrocketing cable bills. Hand-in-glove with Wall Street, Clinton got rid of the Glass Steagall Act, which removed the separation between commercial banks, insurers and investment banks, allowing the self-dealing manipulation of mortgages and interest  rates and accelerating the shifting of huge wealth into the hands of a few. Again, the average person, just trying to make ends meet, eventually got the sharpest end of that spear when millions of people lost their homes, jobs and retirement in the thundering collapse known as the Great Recession, which, for many, has been a depression. Bernie backer bashes Clinton; gets taken off stage There is so much more: A planet dying because for years fossil fuel interests were coddled. Welfare reform. Mass incarceration of people of color, which had both racial and economic consequences. The praise of the Clinton years, and red-faced defense by its leader, was always couched in contrast to the Reagan and two Bush Administrations. Great. Feeding off the Clinton machine, the Democratic Party has become riddled with lobbyists, billionaires, and hustlers who pocket huge sums of money by running either nonprofit \u201cthink tanks\u201d or election-cycle networks, and politicians who, indeed, are focused mostly on reelection. Surrounding the party are extremely well-paid non-profit leaders, who end up defending the status quo. Chief component of the Clinton machine in recent years, the Clinton Foundation operated somewhat out of sight. The big donations streaming from anti-union powerhouses like Wal-Mart or big financial entities like Bank of America not only whitewashed the policies of interests directly opposed to what the Democratic Party should stand for, but they also clouded the deeper systemic crisis within the party. We can only address climate change, poverty and global inequality by axing the very system benefiting many of the donors to the Clinton Foundation. Fast forward to the 2016 election. There is no doubt in my mind that Bernie Sanders would have defeated Trump. His authenticity would have pierced through Trump\u2019s fraudulent appeal. His concise, point-by-point evisceration of a failed economic model and aggressive, blundering foreign policy was entirely understandable to voters. As one of Sen. Sanders\u2019 national surrogates, I went to dozens of his rallies. At each one, he took to the stage, a big sheaf of papers in his hands, and, treating people as adults not just backdrops for TV ads, he conducted a seminar on America and the globe. People are quite familiar with Sanders\u2019 economic agenda, including higher taxes on the wealthy, expanding Social Security and a single-payer Medicare for All system. All of which were sound economically, not to mention morally urgent. How Hillary Clinton lost What was often given short shrift was his broader philosophical willingness to challenge American exceptionalism. Many times, including during two national debates, he pointed out that, while he was proud as a son of immigrants to be an American, this country has supported repressive dictators, sent the CIA on missions to help overthrow democratically elected governments that were not supportive enough of our interests and sent our young men and women to die in immoral wars. And he wasn\u2019t afraid to point out that those failed foreign policies have been bedrocks of the Democratic Party for several decades. Rather than foster a good debate during the primaries, the party, obsessed with the coronation of an anointed candidate, set out to destroy Sanders and his movement. The various email leaks showing broad collusion only confirmed what was patently obvious on the surface: We stood in opposition to a virtual wall of elected Democratic officials, and party functionaries. Proudly so, I might add. As a union member, I was particularly saddened to see the labor movement mostly line up in the primaries behind the status quo \u2014 a status quo often linked arm-and-arm with corporate interests bent on destroying unions. Beyond rhetoric, democracy was not valued. Once Sanders effectively conceded the race, he took on full-throated advocacy for Secretary Clinton. To support his position, many of us, including me, agreed to play nice at the convention and beyond, because we felt that Donald Trump was a unique threat to the nation.  On the night Tim Kaine spoke to the convention, many Sanders delegates like me wanted to express respectful opposition to President Obama\u2019s Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement by holding signs. But, our signs were confiscated, and, when we made some homemade versions on the back of the officially-sanctioned Kaine signs, we were told to cease and desist or our credentials would be revoked. So much for democracy. More important, that gagging of pretty mild protest was symbolic. The party is not an open place, beyond rhetoric, to a whole swath of activists and voters who want deep, systemic change. So, now what? Yesterday was indeed devastating. My niece texted me, \u201cwhat do we do now?\u201d Her desperate question broke my heart. I grew up in a feminist household: My mother was one of a handful of women to break a glass ceiling, going to medical school after she already had her three kids. I know many young women are mourning the blow of a President Trump partly because of the rejection of a woman as the first president \u2013 which is yet another reason I argue we must remake the Democratic Party.  First, the Clinton machine must be rooted out of the party. A quarter of a century is enough time to understand that its ideology has failed the American people. Second, the Democratic National Committee has to be turned inside out. The disgraced and deposed chair, Debbie Wasserman Schultz, is only the worst symptom of this wider truth. The party has lost hundreds of state legislative seats, Republicans now control two-thirds of state chambers and have a comfortable majority of governorships (who will determine redistricting in 2020). They have a historic margin in the House of Representatives, will continue to run the Senate and, thus, likely put a Trump-stamp on the Supreme Court. Third, we need to run targeted primary contests broadly and across the board to replace elected officials who don\u2019t want to see a more open, vibrant and inclusive party. The Sanders movement has shown we can raise the money to fund challengers \u2014 and they are ready, by the thousands, to compete. With these changes, and drawing from the energy of many great activists, a new Democratic Party can be revitalized. The progressive movement, in all its elements \u2014 advocates for labor, environmentalists, and civil rights of all stripes \u2014 can shape that future.",

He is the author of several books, most recently \u201cStokely: A Life.\u201d The views expressed here are his own. Peniel Joseph: Trump's victory isn't the fault of black voters Since 2012, voting rights for African Americans have been under attack Black voters should not be blamed for Hillary Clinton\u2019s stunning election night loss of the presidency. The roots of Donald Trump\u2019s shocking, long-shot, and divisively improbable rise to the presidency can be traced back to election night four years ago when black voter percentage, for the first time in American history, surpassed whites. Black voters led the multiracial groups of voters that re-elected Barack Obama and seemed poised to do so in future presidential election cycles. But a strange thing happened on the way to a rendezvous with victory. The Supreme Court\u2019s 2013 Shelby v. Holder decision did more than just effectively gut law enforcement provisions of the Voting Rights Act. More profoundly, it neutralized black voter participation in key electoral battleground states, including North Carolina and Florida \u2013 states that provided president-elect Trump\u2019s margins of victory. The 2016 race represented more than a test of Hillary Clinton\u2019s ability to maintain, perhaps even grow, the Obama Coalition. As the first presidential election since 1964 to be held absent the full protection of the Voting Rights Act, it was also a test of American democracy. The results, despite heroic efforts by grassroots political organizing such as the Moral Mondays Movement in North Carolina and federal efforts by the Justice Department to protect voting rights, were predictable: a decline in black voters from the glorious highs of 2012. Worse, in the run-up to election day, media narratives presented this predictable decline of black turnout in early voting as a failure of civic action by the African American community instead of a perfectly-executed voter suppression plan hatched by Republican statehouses in the aftermath of the Shelby decision. Observers incorrectly characterized the upswing of Latino early voters as a polarizing contrast between two parts of the Obama Coalition, praising Latinos for comprehending Trump\u2019s threat to American democracy and chastising blacks for somehow not getting the message. Think the election is rigged? Blame the Supreme Court This narrative is in some ways unsurprising: black Americans have historically been demonized for wanting to vote, denigrated for using the vote, and disrespected for not voting enough. During the 19th century and earlier, enslaved African Americans were denied the vote and punished, even killed for openly expressing dreams of black citizenship. Black voting rights for men protected by the 15th amendment were then thwarted during an orchestrated campaign of racial violence, ensuring that most blacks could not freely exercise voting rights until after 1965. Black voting power grew in the post-civil rights era but profound obstacles remained, including numerous Republican-led efforts to diffuse, deny, and denigrate black voting power through gerrymandering of congressional districts, the enactment of voter ID laws, and the closing of polling places in predominantly black and brown communities. Barack Obama\u2019s watershed presidency witnessed a high point in black voter participation, yet this moment of maximum opportunity precipitated an enormous backlash as evidenced by candidate Trump\u2019s blunt talk of voter fraud taking place in \u201cinner cities\u201d across America. How Hillary Clinton lost Blaming black voters for Clinton\u2019s loss ignores the structural constraints placed on that vote while denying black voters\u2019 individual agency. The black community is not monolithic, something attested to by Donald Trump receiving an extraordinary 8% of African American votes. Small pluralities of black voters proved immune to Hillary Clinton\u2019s electoral pleas, casting their votes for third party candidates or staying home to watch as Rome burned. Last night\u2019s election also illustrates that black Americans vote with their heads and hearts. Barack and Michelle Obama\u2019s time in the White House captured the national zeitgeist but appealed to black Americans in a transcendent manner that would be hard for any conventional Democratic politicians to replicate.  Hillary Clinton, despite deploying a raft of star-studded surrogates including the Obamas, LeBron James, Beyonce, and her husband, failed to convince large enough numbers of black voters that she offered the same kind of transformational politics that had catapulted Barack Obama twice into the presidency. The institutional racism that diminished voter protections for poor black and brown citizens along with black voter ambivalence, especially by millennials to Clinton\u2019s candidacy, created a perfect storm of electoral failure.  But we should note that without the participation of voters of color, Clinton\u2019s loss would have been a landslide. Blaming blacks for Clinton\u2019s defeat is not only wrong, but it also feeds the same appetite for racial animus and division that have led us to this dispiriting moment. CNN analyst Van Jones described where we are as a \u201cwhitelash\u201d by Americans paralyzingly afraid of demographic, cultural, and economic changes engulfing \u201ctheir\u201d country.  British voters responded in similarly dramatic fashion earlier this year, triggering the ongoing Brexit crisis.  Large and diverse majorities of white American men and women elevated Trump\u2019s candidacy and elected him president. Less than one in ten African Americans supported the president-elect. Black voters, historically rebuked and scorned, turned out once again to support a democratic vision both profoundly hopeful and expansively inclusive. They should be praised for their heroic efforts in the face of unvarnished hate, not held responsible for Clinton\u2019s defeat.",

She was named a 2010 Woman of the Year by Women in Sports and Events, is a co-author of \u201cSay It Loud: An Illustrated History of the Black Athlete,\u201d and CEO of the Push Marketing Group. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. Roxanne Jones: Obama's election changed the way blacks in America -- particularly the young -- felt about their potential She says electing Hillary Clinton can bring the same sea change to American women and girls On a golden autumn morning eight years ago \u2014 the day after America elected its first black president \u2013 I took a photo of my 14-year-old son walking out the front door to catch the school bus.  And I noticed he was standing just a little taller than before, his high-top Afro fluffed up a bit bigger. His smile full of excitement about the future. Will America\u2019s women and girls ever get to feel this way? ***** We love to tell our daughters and sons that they can achieve anything, become anything they dare to dream. Study hard, work hard, we say, and there is no limit to what you can achieve. This was the mantra of my grade-school years. Nice sentiment. But I doubt those well-meaning white teachers really believed it applied to people like me.  They knew it would take much more than a dream for a little black girl \u2014 or indeed any girl \u2014 to reach her full potential. In our male-driven culture, where we have yet to achieve racial, gender or economic equality and where justice for all remains an elusive notion, we betray those ambitious words every day. Still, we cling desperately to this beautiful, necessary lie. Because to believe otherwise is to admit defeat. If we are blessed, fate steps in and the unimaginable happens. President Barack Obama happens.  We break free from the lie and the potential suddenly becomes reality. In one of the country\u2019s brightest moments, Americans of all persuasions united, more than 69 million strong, to elect him. Black voters turned out in record numbers and gave him 95% of their votes. That night in 2008, it felt like a jubilee. Now eight years later, Hillary Clinton is the first woman ever nominated by a major party to be president of the United States.  Again, we have an opportunity to free ourselves from the lie. Armed with a resume of experiences and achievements that make her one of the most qualified people ever to run for the office (it frankly puts her opponent,  Donald Trump, to shame) Clinton promises to fight for women\u2019s rights and equal pay. She pledges to stand up for working families, children and immigrants. She proposes tax breaks for the middle class and affordable college plans. And, for those of us who feel none of this matters if police brutality and the mass imprisonment of black and brown Americans is not addressed, Clinton vows to shepherd in criminal justice reforms and work to dismantle the systematic racism that corrupts our nation. To hear Clinton\u2019s vision for America is to want to believe, all over again. Though we are battle-weary from the divisiveness of Washington over the past eight years, and from what has to be the nastiest presidential campaign season we\u2019ve ever seen, we still yearn for the brighter vision. First lady Michelle Obama shared it with a crowd in North Carolina recently: \u201cThis candidate calls on us to turn against each other, to build walls, to be afraid. And then there\u2019s Hillary\u2019s vision for this country \u2014 a vision of a nation that is powerful and vibrant and strong, big enough to have a place for all of us. A nation where we each have something very special to contribute and where we are always stronger together.\u201d For black Americans especially, the effect of Obama\u2019s election cannot be overstated.   It\u2019s almost impossible to recall the optimism of 2008 (if I hadn\u2019t been there, I\u2019d fear it was but a dream), and on that November day, none of us truly understood how deeply the election would affect the course of our nation, our lives, our families. But on that day, my son changed. My Brooklyn neighborhood changed. It became happier, more friendly, more diverse. Baldwin and McKinnon break character in final 'SNL' before election We became more politically active and vocal about issues facing our community. My son became a leader in the classroom, on the basketball court and among his peers. He set ambitious college and career goals that never wavered. He showed a new sense of purpose and inner strength all  his own. Obviously, it would be ludicrous to credit President Obama for all this. All I know is that each night before my son went to bed and each morning when he rose, he looked at the glossy 11x17 color poster of President Obama he\u2019d hung on his wall, the same poster he later took to college and more recently to his first apartment when he became an engineer. His mom, faith restored, returned to church to pray for the continued safety and success of our President and our nation, something most black folks I know still faithfully do every day. After Obama, I became more focused on mentoring and community service. At work, I stood taller, smiled more and set new goals, determined to succeed in my ESPN world. But it became less important for me to prove I could excel in a testosterone-charged environment and more vital that I reach for a higher purpose. Watching that beautiful black family in the White House expanded my horizons. I began to think very differently about my God-given potential and my purpose on this Earth. Agree or disagree with her politics, Hillary Clinton, if she becomes President, will change the world. She will continue to redefine the way we view womanhood in America \u2014 and not just for white women \u2014 for each of us. Already I can see new excitement in the eyes the girls in my neighborhood when they talk about Hillary Clinton, daring to dream: \u201cDo you think she\u2019ll really win?\u201d they ask me. \u201cI\u2019m so nervous,\u201d Sofia said the other day. We all are. The very idea of a woman as President is something these girls never imagined \u2013 not a Hillary Clinton, and sadly, definitely not themselves. In a dark time, GOP offers positive vision Hillary Clinton has taught them something new. Win or lose, she has inspired girls to reach for more than just the kind of fame that comes to a Beyonc\u00e9 or a Katy Perry. Talented and smart women as they are, we need a more diverse model of womanhood that lifts our daughters beyond the realm of entertainment, or even a higher step up the corporate ladder. Clinton, with her conservative pantsuits and studious demeanor, shows girls (and reminds us all) that for a woman to command the world stage, she needn\u2019t wear sexy sequins and perform amazing dance routines. She can be amazing because of her brain, her vision, her ambitions for the world. Her goals can stretch beyond  marriage and mothering, to helping others and serving her country.  Hillary Clinton is modeling this for girls and young women and older women, too. She has shown courage, but also the intellect and the vision to step up and lead. She has had the tenacity to keep standing in the face of every fight or failure in her professional or private life.  She does not see herself as less than any man. Opinion: Trump judges women by their bodies. Do you? Why is this so important? If our nation is ever to become something greater than it is today, things must improve for women, who make up 50.8% of the population. It is time.  It is time we promoted a vision for women in which our worth is measured by more than how well we can manipulate men or succeed in a male-dominated culture. The fight for women\u2019s equality has never been solely about sexual freedoms. It is about my right to fully exist without man-made economic and legislative limitations set up to interfere with my ability to control my destiny, my body and my mind. Hillary Clinton gets this. A President Hillary Clinton will not solve all our problems. She cannot undo the divisiveness of the past eight years, or more than 300 years of slavery and Jim Crow. She cannot magically empower every woman, especially since many of us, fooled by flattery or flashy lifestyles, refuse to even consider the depths of our oppression. We have been conditioned to value ourselves through the eyes of men. But a generation of American women and men will learn something new: to never underestimate the power of a woman. Since the beginning of creation, we have been ordained to greatness. We have ruled over rich cultures and nations. Women have led many of today\u2019s most successful economies, including India, Great Britain and Germany, and even smaller progressive countries such as Costa Rica and Liberia. Women leading in the world is not a new notion. It\u2019s time for America to catch up.",

He is the author of several books, most recently \u201cStokely: A Life.\u201d The views expressed here are his. Peniel Joseph: Trump voters -- with their myths and realities -- have lessons to teach America We ignore these lessons \"at the peril of both our national character and political destiny,\" Joseph says Supporters of either Donald Trump or Hillary Clinton view America as a Rorschach test, one wherein the same image elicits wildly contrasting depictions of the state of the nation, the health of our republic and the beating heart of democracy. Clinton\u2019s multiracial groups of supporters are attempting to maintain and grow the Obama Coalition, an unprecedentedly racially diverse group of voters that twice elected Barack Obama to the White House. At the same time, the Trump campaign\u2019s overt hostility to the very idea of racial equality or diversity has inspired outrage, hand wringing, and disgust, not the least of which has emanated from Clinton herself, who famously characterized at least a portion of Trump\u2019s supporters as a \u201cbasket of deplorables.\u201d These Trump supporters, overwhelming white, male and working-class, have taken the brunt of criticism from both liberals and conservatives, who have been appalled, for admittedly different reasons, by the boorish behavior on display at political rallies teeming with an edge of racial violence, overt misogyny and anti-immigrant and anti-Muslim fervor.  Violence, in the form of bullying female journalists, threatening Clinton with indictment, jail, impeachment and assassination and physical assaults on anti-Trump protesters have become a hallmark of this mean political season. But these details, the foundation of so much criticism and conversation for weeks and months, obscure an important reality. Portrayals of the majority of Trump voters as a part of a misbegotten white working class \u2013 dreaming of a return to Eisenhower America\u2019s competitive advantage over the rest of the world, with benefits disproportionately doled out to white men with relatively little education \u2013 have obscured the larger story of this election season: the fact that many quiet supporters of the Republican presidential nominee have very little in common with the working class caricatures most often featured in the national press. Almost half of Trump voters in the Republican primaries had college degrees, for instance. It\u2019s a convenient assumption that Trump\u2019s brand of bigotry primarily appealed to uneducated whites living in racially segregated rural areas \u2013 swaths of post-industrial sections of the Midwest that became casualties of the shift from smokestack and factory labor to a globalized economy that values highly educated engineers more than steel workers. But it isn\u2019t true. One part of the narrative is true, however. Trump\u2019s support has been overwhelmingly white, with blacks polling in the single digits and Latinos in the 20s.  It is also true that white men and women without college degrees overwhelmingly favor Trump. Yet one third of white women with college degrees and 40% of college-educated white men also support the candidate whose \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d tagline has evolved into as much of a threat as a campaign slogan.   And while rural voters are positively euphoric in support of the real estate magnate, the suburban electorate is not far behind: 44% of them expressing support, along with 28% of urban voters. Eric Trump speaks a family language What are we to make of this large and diverse group of white voters expressing support for a candidate many critics have derided as nothing less than a prophet of hate and division whose campaign has threatened to rend the very fabric of the republic? Whether Trump wins or loses, at least three observations are important to make. These lessons, derived more from the behavior of the \u201cquiet\u201d Trump voter than from those whose angry bluster fills the airwaves, teach us important lessons about ourselves as a country, ones that we would do well not to ignore in the months and years to come First, Trump\u2019s campaign tapped into political furies that transcend a single political cycle and go beyond one slice of the American electorate. His campaign has galvanized diverse groups of millions of white Americans, from a range of educational, geographic and economic circumstances and backgrounds. Many of them were drawn to his criticism of Washington corruption, his caustic attacks on Hillary Clinton and his bombastic \u201ctell it like it is\u201d denigration of our nation\u2019s racial, ethnic and religious diversity.  For these voters, Trump is not so much an anachronistic ghost of a racist past as a truth-teller, unafraid of being politically incorrect. Why do so many Americans hate Hillary Clinton? Second, the \u201clesser of two evils\u201d argument is not a compelling enough reason to inspire millions of Americans to be politically engaged.  Hillary Clinton\u2019s long history of public service deserves substantive praise and criticism, yet the public narrative shaped by right wing critics, mainstream media and the candidate\u2019s own numerous unforced errors (and occasional egregious mistakes) obscured this understanding of Clinton as a politician and a person.  While Trump basked in his role as a purveyor of innuendo and master of chaos, Clinton remained too often a distant figure, unable to emotionally connect with many of the very constituencies she claimed to be passionately fighting for. Third, and most crucially, race matters. A lot. Trump\u2019s candidacy played on on the double-consciousness of racial anxiety in American society. On one side, we have the historic fear, demonization and criminalization of black bodies, reflected in Trump\u2019s repeated use of the coded phrases \u201cChicago,\u201d \u201claw and order\u201d and \u201cinner city\u201d: metaphors meant to imply a coming racial apocalypse. Equally important, Trump capitalized on white economic anxiety across the board, realizing in a way that the neo-liberals in Washington have not, the marginalization of college-educated and white working class in an economy whose benefits have been overwhelmingly hoarded by the less than 1%.  If \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d captured the zeitgeist of grassroots movements for racial and economic justice in the Age of Obama, \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d uncovered the rage, anxiety, and bitterness of white Americans gripped by fears of declining economic mobility, fatigued by national discussion of police shootings of blacks and unsure of whom to blame.  In a world where blacks and whites increasingly live, go to school, work and die in segregated communities, worlds apart, this was perhaps the easiest part of Trump\u2019s rise. For better or worse, the reverberations of millions of white voters\u2019 support for a Trump candidacy will continue for American democracy, long after next Tuesday\u2019s election. We ignore the consequences of these impulses at the peril of both our national character and political destiny.",

Odom: Election 2016 has taken a toll on America with its offensive rhetoric More employers need to start having conversations about racism awareness, she writes As we count down the hours until Election Day, many of us begin to wonder how we will put the pieces back together and move forward as one country with many voices, faces, and legacies. Some may dismiss the figures of speech used by candidates in this presidential election as common \u201cpolitical tropes.\u201d But others of us see incredibly tainted and damaging language in speeches and debates, filled with both coded and blatant references to race, stereotypes of communities of color, immigrant scapegoating and divisive suggestions of isolation, barriers, and \u201cotherness.\u201d In describing the current election\u2019s climate, people have used language like \u201ccorrosive,\u201d \u201cunhinged,\u201d and \u201cunearthed\u201d as some of the ways in which we have seen civility and empathy disappear. What many of us do agree on is that things have changed.  The discourse has changed, our trust in others has changed, and many people are grappling with how to have difficult conversations about what Dr. Robin DiAngelo has called the most nuanced and complex topic of race and identity. Eric Liu recently wrote in the Atlantic, \u201cWhatever the outcome on Election Day, more than 40 percent of American voters will feel despondent, disgusted, and betrayed. Which is why all across the country there are citizen-led efforts underway to heal the divides created by the presidential election, to repair the social fabric, to restore trust and civility.\u201d We will need to be intentional in how we move forward after November 8, and how we address issues of race, power, and the impact of race/racism in our cities, schools and workplaces. As professor Khalil Gibran Mohammed of the Harvard Kennedy School has said, \u201cthere is no expiration date on understanding our racial history. It will always be with us.\u201d President Obama: We all know racial bias exists Talking about race in the U.S. has never been easy, and is often viewed as divisive.  Our complicated, painful, and often undiscussed history around race has created barriers to authentic conversations. Even more difficult for some is the idea of talking about race in the workplace. The vitriol and bigotry that have become a part of the presidential election campaign has had a documented impact on schools. Why would we think that it has not impacted us as adults, or our workplaces? In many ways, it appears that educational institutions have moved ahead of companies and organizations in how they are helping students unpack what they are hearing. Discussions help students address their potential biases and understand concepts of power, privilege, access, history, systemic racism and civil discourse. Perhaps we can learn something from these classroom lessons. Trying to appear \"not too black\" on Airbnb is exhausting Recent tragedies in our country, coupled with a presidential election where language of implicit bias, race, and racism are frequent, have raised the need for companies to move beyond a narrative of colorblindness, \u201cpost-racial\u201d confusion, and silence. \u201cTolerance is for cowards\u201d was the phrase Randall Stephenson, AT&T\u2019s CEO, recently used when talking about the need for real dialogue on race relations. A video of Stephenson calling for a dialogue on race has been shared widely via social media. It is another recent and important example of how we can talk about race in the workplace \u2013 and the need to do more.  (Editor\u2019s note: CNN\u2019s parent company, Time Warner, has reached an agreement to be acquired by AT&T.) These recent comments came the same week that we saw new research from LeanIn.org and McKinsey about women of color being the most underrepresented group in the corporate workforce. There is not an impenetrable wall that keeps race-related issues out of the workplace. July 2016 was a time in our current history where the realities of race and racism have been a catalyst for dialogue in many workplaces around the country. The pain, anger, and confusion surrounding the killings of Philando Castile and Alton Sterling could not be left at the door. These events, followed by the tragic killing of two Dallas police officers, highlighted systemic tensions, challenges, biases, and need for action that many have not wanted to see. The privileges of protesting while white A CBS/NYTimes poll taken right after the incidents in July showed America\u2019s race relations to be at a low point. Many workplaces struggled with crafting messages that would be \u201cfair\u201d and responsive to the many feelings and concerns that were present.  Many chief diversity officers came together to share strategies for how they were working towards continued dialogue and action. Many organizations realized that they lacked the awareness, language, and skills needed to have an honest conversation about race in the United States and in the workplace. Many companies did find ways to respond constructively and dedicate time and space for honest conversations. Some held dialogues; some organized roundtables with their CEO; and some organizations provided counselors on site for employees. There are countless stories that did not make the news of good leaders who set aside meeting agendas to allow space for people to talk about how they were feeling.  For organizations that had not discussed or acknowledged racial issues, or the impact of societal events on employees and the workplace, the events in July provided a catalyst that challenged assumptions of knowledge, comfort, and awareness. True conversations about race in the workplace would mean that we would need to discuss systemic issues of access, sponsorship, and more.  It would require more engaged and nuanced conversations that move beyond the popular (and yet important) \u201cunconscious bias/implicit bias\u201d awareness to conversations that that address intersectionality, history, and power, with a goal of action, movement, and change. This is part of the deeper conversation that needs to take place.  A recent Harvard Business Review article, \u201cWe Just Can\u2019t Handle Diversity,\u201d explored some of our challenges with diversity and stated that awareness of systems is part of our challenge with diversity: \u201cIf those in power think this world is basically fair and just, they won\u2019t even recognize \u2013 much less worry about \u2013 systemic unfairness.\u201d Opinion: How the Lovings changed our American lives Not talking about race has prevented many employees in organizations from connecting, understanding each other, and learning more about how we can in fact truthfully address the impact of race in our schools, communities, and workplaces. My hope is that we are slowly moving towards healthier, bolder, and honest dialogue \u2013 one that cannot just happen after a tragedy or big news story. We cannot undo what we have seen and heard in our history and in the last couple of months. But most importantly we can acknowledge that biased statements and continued tragedies will not go away, and that we do indeed bring our fears and biases into the workplace. As we elect a new president and work to move forward, we cannot mute the conversation about race and identity.",

She is the author of \u201cThe New Black Politician: Cory Booker, Newark and Post-Racial America.\u201d She is working on a new book, \u201cAfrican Americans and the Obama Administration: Substance, Symbols and Hope,\u201d due out next year, as well as another project on blacks and their relationship with the Republican Party. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. Andra Gillespie: Hillary Clinton has a framing and a get-out-the-vote challenge with black voters as she enters the home stretch Gillespie says to get blacks to the polls, Clinton must do the hard work to make personal contact with these voters Hillary Clinton has a framing and a get-out-the-vote challenge with black voters as she enters the home stretch of her campaign. Those of them who do show up to vote Tuesday will largely vote for Clinton because they cannot fathom voting for the alternative.  She just has to get enough of them out if she hopes to win. To do that, her campaign will have to do the hard work to make personal contact with these voters. And, at the end of the day, these types of activities \u2013not the glitzy rallies and concerts \u2013 are what drive up turnout. At this critical moment in her campaign, Clinton and her team must take great care to address black Americans\u2019 concerns. For example, in the wake of police shootings and the emergence of Black Lives Matter, many young blacks are impatient with and intolerant of politicians who make campaign promises and then disappear after the votes are counted. She needs to persuade them of her sincere interest in their concerns, both now and beyond Election Day. All of this has come into sharp focus as the election has tightened in the past few days, and as a new headline \u2013 that fewer blacks are voting early \u2013 has emerged. African-Americans, once the stalwart of early voting, have so far voted at lower rates than they did in 2012 in competitive states like Florida, Georgia and North Carolina.  Democratic campaigns are watching these numbers with quiet alarm, knowing that anemic black turnout can spell the difference between winning and losing elections. A combination of factors contribute to the potential decline in black voter turnout. The absence of a black candidate like President Obama no doubt partly explains it, as does the fact that Democrats generally have not been as enthusiastic about this year\u2019s campaign as in years past. As November 8 approaches, I would urge observers to pay close attention to turnout rates across both age and racial groups, though, and redouble their efforts at get-out-the-vote operations.  That black turnout might be lower in 2016 has always been a possibility. While the Current Population Survey reported record high black turnout in 2008 and 2012 \u2013 black turnout even surpassed white turnout in 2012 \u2013  observers have long wondered if turnout rates would recede when Barack Obama was no longer on the ballot. Compounding the problem has been the general lack of enthusiasm for Hillary Clinton\u2019s candidacy. In addition to perceptions that Clinton lacks the charisma of President Obama or her husband, her candidacy has failed to resonate fully among some segments of the black population. To be sure, Donald Trump does not resonate either, but qualitative and quantitative reports point to the fact that young blacks in particular may not fully embrace Clinton as a candidate.  Whether they view her as just another politician or believe that her support of crime policies in the 1990s led to the rise of a racially discriminatory police state, numerous measures indicate that Clinton has not captured the imagination of black voters in this election. How Russia is trying to rig the US election Recently, I teamed up with colleagues at The George Washington University to write a report for the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies based on survey data that they collected at the beginning of the general election cycle. There were clear differences in how older and younger voters viewed this election. Black voters ages 18 to 29 were significantly less likely than their older counterparts to say that they definitely planned on voting, and more likely than their grandparents\u2019 generation to state that they did not plan on voting at all. Trump links Clinton to crime in voter outreach strategy And among those who did indicate support for Hillary Clinton, there were generational divisions in how they rationalized their support.  Black voters under 40 were more likely to say that they were voting against Trump, while black voters age 40 and older were more likely to frame their vote as a vote for Clinton. Clinton is going to have to convince these skeptical constituents that it is worth their while to vote \u2013 and to vote for her. She must make clear that her intentions of staying engaged with these communities after the election are genuine. Then, if she is elected, she will have to follow through on her promise to stay engaged and to be responsive.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Laura Coates is a CNN legal analyst. She is a former assistant U.S. attorney for the District of Columbia and trial attorney in the Civil Rights Division of the Department of Justice. Follow her @thelauracoates. The views expressed are her own. Coates: It will not be the interference of Big Brother that may affect the election. It will be the notable absence of a few thousand of them This time, Big Brother took a proverbial seat and borrowed Lady Justice's blindfold If you think this election will be rigged, blame the United States Supreme Court. Back in 2013, the Court gutted the formula component of the Voting Rights Act in the case of Shelby County v. Holder. Under that formula, any state that had a voter turnout or registration rate of less than 50% as of 1964, and had any history of discriminatory restrictions \u2013 like literacy tests or English-only ballots \u2013 was required to get pre-clearance from the Justice Department before changing its voting laws. The Supreme Court held that this formula was sociologically outdated and it\u2019s failure to use more recent data was unconstitutional. This holding did not deem the Voting Rights Act unconstitutional, but it did eliminate a key mechanism used to enforce it. As a result, the Justice Department\u2019s Civil Rights Division lost its right to require states with a history of racial discrimination to get its pre-authorization before making any changes to voting laws: i.e. drawing electoral districts, placing restrictions on early voting, or requiring specific forms of voter identification Meanwhile, voting rights advocates reeled, state election officials rejoiced, and the nation mistakenly believed that the only real consequence of Shelby would be the facilitation of voter identification laws or gerrymandering. In reality, the consequences of this decision are more far-reaching, and should be at the heart of any informed discussion on whether the presidential election is indeed rigged. As a trial attorney in the Voting Rights Section of the Justice Department\u2019s Civil Rights Division, I have monitored many local, state and federal elections. Any suggestion of rampant, extensive voter fraud is sheer hyperbole. What is an issue, however, is how polling officials conduct elections, whom they decide to let (or not let) vote, and how they determine which ballots to count. Poll: People don't believe Trump will accept results Self-interested groups intimidating voters at the polls is also an important issue in this, and with numerous polling sites across the country, the only way to know about this is through election monitoring. There are three kinds of election monitors: Justice Department Voting Rights attorneys; Federal Election Observers who have been assigned to a handful of states that have been sued by the Department for voting-related discrimination; and Federal Election Observers who have been dispatched to states subject to the pre-authorization formula. Federal Election Observers are trained to observe whether polling officials are discriminating against voters or otherwise violating federal law. They can\u2019t interfere, but they are instructed to alert someone who can. At the polls, their presence has a prophylactic effect. After the election, their observations can become evidence in a federal lawsuit. Federal Election Observers have the authority to enter and monitor any polling place with or without the permission of the election officials. Justice Department attorneys, on the other hand, are at the mercy of polling officials who can turn them away if they so please. It\u2019s the third category, formula-based Federal Observers, who comprise the majority of election monitors. At the behest of the Attorney General and the Justice Department, thousands are routinely dispatched to polling places throughout the country. Or they were, at least. Although the Supreme Court clearly said the Justice Department could no longer use the formula for pre-authorization, the Court never said that the Department couldn\u2019t use the formula to determine where to send Federal Election Observers. But that\u2019s precisely how the Justice Department interpreted Shelby, nonetheless. Consequently, the Department has chosen to sideline Federal Election Observers in any state not already subject to a court order. Instead, they will send perhaps a few dozen Justice Department Trial Attorneys in their place. Donald Trump: We are winning Why would a Department led by a Democratic political appointee do this, knowing that it may have a detrimental impact on Democratic voters? Ironically, because of democracy. Democracy divides power among the three branches of government.  When the Supreme Court struck down the formula provision, it was exclusively within the purview of Congress to replace it. Congress never did, leaving the Justice Department without the authority to use that formula to determine either which states require pre-authorization or where to send Federal Election Observers. I suppose the Justice Department could create its own formula and use it to determine where to send Observers, but that\u2019s akin to making law, which the constitution expressly forbids.  And let\u2019s not forget, it is Congress that must foot the bill for sending Federal Observers.  The same Congress that failed to create a new formula is unlikely to fund an Observer program based on one created by another branch. What could this mean for voters? Polling officials will be on an honor system in deciding whether the voters are entitled to vote, in which language they are entitled to receive a ballot, whether they can have assistance, and whether any provisional ballots should be counted. When the polls close, any inappropriate counting or unlawful destruction of ballots will go unnoticed and unreported. Timely resolution of systemic voter issues will be impracticable, and can only be dealt with after the fact, through protracted litigation \u2013 well after the Inauguration of the next President of the United States. It will not be the interference of Big Brother that may affect the election. It will be the notable absence of a few thousand of them. This time, Big Brother took a proverbial seat and borrowed Lady Justice\u2019s blindfold.",

Her latest book is \u201cItalian Fascism\u2019s Empire Cinema.\u201d The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. Ruth Ben-Ghiat: Michael Moore's new movie is part therapy session, part political theater Moore is at his most effective when he addresses gender and racial anxieties raised by prospect of a female president, she says No wonder Trump\u2019s a nightmare for many conservatives right now: His followers who talk of violent uprisings surrounding the election merely expose the long-minimized subversive core of the Republican Party. Whatever the results on November 8, the GOP \u2013 what will be left of it \u2013 has some serious soul-searching to do. But he wants you to vote for Trump\u2019s Democratic opponent, Hillary Clinton, anyway, even if you have to hold your noses and force your hands to check that box. For the good of the country, \u201csometimes we have to take some medicine,\u201d Moore says in his documentary \u201cMichael Moore in Trumpland,\u201d after clarifying that he has never before voted for a Clinton. \u201cYou will know what to do.\u201d Part therapy session, part political theater (including a stand-up comedy routine by Moore), \u201cTrumpland\u201d is the ultra-liberal Michael Moore\u2019s attempt to \u201ccome out and meet you halfway,\u201d to understand America\u2019s current mood \u2013 both for Trump and against Clinton. To do this, he\u2019s traveled to Wilmington, Ohio, famous for inventing the banana split but ordinary in its gun festivals, small-town economic problems, and Republican loyalty. He rented a theater and invited the population to an interactive performance, which he filmed for the movie. This citizen audience becomes the supporting cast of a film that has two stars: Moore, who\u2019s on stage and present, and Clinton, who\u2019s on stage as her younger self, the subject of the large-scale black and white photos that form the stage backdrop. Trump makes a cameo, when he\u2019s interviewed in the early 1990s saying that Clinton is a good woman and should stay married to her adulterous husband, but \u201cTrumpland\u201d is mostly free of Trump, who Moore seems to see as a vessel for the anger and worry white Americans feel about their future. The \u201csegregated\u201d areas in the theater for \u201cMexican and Mexican-looking\u201d and \u201cMuslim\u201d residents \u2013 the former with a wall built around them, the latter watched by a drone \u2013 provide comic touches, but seriously rebuke the \u201ctake back America for Americans\u201d ethos that\u2019s driven Republicans in this election. Moore\u2019s at his most effective when he addresses the gender and racial anxieties raised by the prospect of a female president after eight years of an African-American one. He plays therapy group leader, voicing painful thoughts about the decline of white male power. \u201cIt\u2019s over for us,\u201d he confesses. We\u2019re no longer needed: not for procreation (in-vitro fertilization takes care of that), not for cohabitation (women living alone trends upward) and not even to reach things on the top shelf. While he riffs into his customary parody \u2013 \u201cthere will be internment camps for men,\u201d \u2013 Moore hits a chord when he characterizes the loudness and chaos of Trump rallies as \u201cthe sound of the dying dinosaur \u2026 Donald save us!\u201d During this part of his monologue, some men listened with their arms crossed, unsmiling. Others looked uncomfortable. And others cheered, along with the women. Dismissing these frequent reaction shots as corny, as some critics have done, misses a main point of Moore\u2019s film: to create an atmosphere of understanding and trust, in order to bridge the divide. To this end, Moore asked the audience to call out their objections to Clinton, and also things they did like. After so many scripted debates and town halls, it is refreshing to see some spontaneity. To be sure, the movie suffers from being thrown together in just 11 days. The dramatic tension built up by this dialogue with the audience disappears when Moore segues to a hokey segment of what he\u2019d do if he were president. And few will buy the comparison between Pope Francis and Clinton (both of them, according to Moore, reformers who have had to bide their time until gaining power).  Yet his narrative of a Clinton massacred by the male political establishment for her attempts in the 1990s to bring universal health care to America, and his tally of 1 million dead Americans as the consequences of the path we did take \u2013 health care only for some, and bad health care for many \u2013 is very powerful. And the cautionary tale he tells about Brexit, where voters treated the ballot as an \u201canger management tool,\u201d seemed to resonate. Through it all, the images of Clinton as an idealistic young woman look back at us. She\u2019s in her cap and gown, at her commencement; she has the sun on her face and the wind in her hair. She is humanized in a way she has not been as the \u201ccandidate.\u201d And perhaps this is the spirit Moore wishes to rouse from the dead: our ability to look inside ourselves, and then look back at our fellow Americans, Clinton included, with new eyes, as we consider our choices on November 8.",

The views expressed are her own. Marjorie K. Eastman: My generation of service members has left a legacy rooted in our actions We need a nation that serves together and carries the consequences of war, poverty, racism, education, she says Wednesday is more to me than just another useless debate, an event I\u2019ll DVR because I don\u2019t want my young son to hear the unfortunately vulgar, scorched earth exchange that has become the 2016 election. Although viewership probably won\u2019t be anywhere near the record-breaking numbers of the first debate, most Americans will still check in Wednesday night to watch our nation\u2019s top two contenders duke it out for a chance to become the next president of the United States. Personally, I wish our nation would have marked the calendar for a different reason. October 19 represents something much more to my family because it was the day that my husband \u2013 and hundreds of other soldiers \u2013 parachuted into Afghanistan 15 years ago. This was one of the first visible displays to the world that something resembling war had truly begun. Most recall the night-vision imagery of young Army Rangers jumping out of a C-130. And, if you can take yourself back in time for just a second, recall how a majority of us watched that video with pride; we knew we had the best military in the world, we would rain hell on our enemies and secure retribution for the gutless attacks on our innocent civilians. Our country was still suffering from 9/11, but we were united and determined to confront the problem. These faceless shadows that jumped into the dark night were shockingly part of the less than 1% of Americans who serve in uniform. And those who have participated in this conflict \u2013 the longest war in our nation\u2019s history \u2013 over the last 15 years have not lost the spirit showcased that night. Service members continue to unite against all odds; they continue to show resolve. In fact, I observed during my 10 years of post-9/11 military service that we became an even better military, a stronger force. That selfless commitment only grew. All the while, the opposite has seemed to happen within our country; we\u2019ve become more divided, angrier and fearful on a level that rivals the 9/11 era. Nevertheless, October 19 can engender hope and promise. This date marks when the next greatest generation was born: the Frontline Generation. My generation of service members has left a legacy rooted in our actions: to volunteer and be exposed to the forefront of action, time and time again. We faced challenges head on, charted new paths and transformed military norms. Anyone who said, \u201ccount me in,\u201d in this asymmetric environment was exposed to danger. This started with those in the military and extended to journalists, government officials, nongovernment workers and contractors alike. That act of service \u2013 this selflessness \u2013 took character. And, as this presidential election should have reminded all of us by now, character matters. We need leaders to elevate the conversation and to debate the policies in our country. Policies that led us to fight in the Middle East and struggle to maintain the focus and the will to complete our mission. Policies that were voted on by representatives who did not have skin in the game, as the vast majority of members of Congress have never worn a uniform \u2013 and nor have many of their children. The policies that should have risen \u2013 ones that championed national service \u2013 were never raised or passed by these elected officials. This idea could unite seemingly disparate groups in our communities and increase innovation in our economy \u2014 because when people solve problems together and struggle together, they also grow together. Now, imagine if this Frontline Generation was more than 1% of our society. Imagine if the lessons of resilience and resourcefulness had been acquired by not only them, but by the majority of Americans? Do you think we would have the same problems today \u2013 the increase in vitriol, racial tensions and disenfranchisement? Do you think our government would have shut down multiple times, turned a blind eye to the national debt or had such a rapid decline in educational rankings? Do you think the same policy decisions would have been made if we all had skin in the game? As someone who has the Frontline perspective, I have your answer. The Frontline Generation leveraged differences, built coalitions and found the common ground to make it to higher ground. The post-9/11 service member is well aware of the cost of freedom, the price of democracy and the need for leadership. And, we desperately want the rest of America to know we are one team. As a president in my lifetime once said, \u201cAmerica is too great for small dreams.\u201d We, who have been out front and gave all of ourselves for the dream \u2013 and who have lost loved ones who gave their life for this dream \u2013 we know America is indeed too great already.  Those who serve witness this truth firsthand in the actions of those to our left and to our right \u2013 our brothers and sisters in arms, the embedded journalists, the State Department officials, or those doctors without borders \u2013 because there are no front lines today. The people we served beside became them. They showed up, they stepped up, they confronted the problem. I believe we would not be in the mess that is this terrible election if more than 1% of our country had had some skin in the game for the past 15 years. So, here it is America. We have bigger problems than this election. We need a nation that serves together, that knows each other and carries the consequences of war, poverty, racism, education, etc. \u2013 together. Our good fortune is that we can start to confront these very real problems thanks to the reservoir of leaders from the Frontline Generation. This day represents so much more than just the third presidential debate. This day is the day we must realize that the next greatest generation is in front of us \u2013 they\u2019ve been on the front lines for all of us, for the past 15 years.",

The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. S.E. Cupp: For those who believe neither Trump nor Clinton have the answers, Evan McMullin could just be the only choice People are sick of what they've been offered in this election, McMullin tells Cupp In a shocking new poll of Utah voters, Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton are now tied at 26%, while independent candidate Evan McMullin, a Utah native, has surged to a statistical tie, with 22%. I\u2019ve written about McMullin\u2019s strategy before, and how he could play an unlikely spoiler to Trump and Clinton. But when he reached out to me last week, it wasn\u2019t to discuss his chances or his ground game. It was to talk about Syria. After noticing one of my so-called tweet-storms on the plight of the Syrian children, he thought we could have an important conversation on a topic that has been, over the course of this election, politicized, overshadowed or ignored altogether. For those of us who think this a crucial national security and humanitarian crisis, and who believe neither Trump nor Clinton have the right answers, McMullin could just be the only choice on November 8. Here is our conversation: Cupp: What in your background has informed your positions on Syria and other foreign policy issues? McMullin: On my first day in Damascus, I was in the souk [marketplace], using broken Arabic to talk to a spice vendor there. We had a nice, simple conversation until I asked him his views on the government, and his thoughts on Bashar al-Assad. He appeared nervous and I thought that he just didn\u2019t understand my broken Arabic. So I asked again and he actually fled to the back of his shop. I saw a fear in his eyes of the government that I had not ever seen anywhere before. But as I traveled around Syria, to different corners of the country, I saw that fear in everyone\u2019s eyes. It had a deep impact on me, as an American, believing in liberty, freedom and equality. It was completely unacceptable that humans would live in this way. I would later go on to serve at the Central Intelligence Agency, where I was exposed even further to authoritarian and dictatorial regimes, and I saw the harm they caused to people, economies and entire countries. I\u2019ve developed, I think, a special opposition in my heart to tyranny. In Syria, I see Assad willing to spill the blood of hundreds of thousands of people, all to protect his own grip on power in Syria. I simply cannot remain silent without taking action on my own. I\u2019ve tried to be a vocal advocate for international action that would stop Assad\u2019s slaughter of innocent Syrians, and eventually set the stage for a negotiated departure from the country. Cupp: You\u2019ll often hear that there are no good solutions in Syria. Is that true? McMullin:  Well, there are no easy options. But they\u2019ve gotten harder the longer we\u2019ve taken the path of inaction. We were worried the country would descend into chaos if we took action. But inaction has led to precisely that. We\u2019re not perfect. I believe Iraq was a mistake. I think we need to be very careful in how we engage overseas. But the truth is that a smarter foreign policy, a foreign policy I advocate for, is one that engages, but more smartly. We don\u2019t let problems become crises. We strengthen our alliances. We didn\u2019t do that on Syria. Assad was testing us and testing the world. The signal he got from us what that he could carry out chemical weapons attacks against the Syrian people. We should have enforced the red line. That would have sent a strong message to Assad that those atrocities wouldn\u2019t be tolerated. We should have done more to support the moderate Syrian opposition, and we still need to do that. They haven\u2019t received sufficient support or training, and we know how to do that very well. The Turks, the Jordanians, the Kurds \u2013 yes, they all come with their own quirks, but we ought to support their efforts too. There needs to be a no-fly zone to stop the aerial bombardment of Syrian population centers. We\u2019ve just got to do it. There are ways to do it cheap. It needs to be done. People want to separate humanitarian disasters from national security disasters. But often times they are both. Syria is a perfect example of that. A brutal dictatorship like Assad\u2019s creates a space for terrorism. Massive refugee flows have created political tensions in Europe and here in the US, opening up opportunities for white nationalist movements to advance here. That\u2019s a national security disaster. I believe Donald Trump\u2019s candidacy is connected to that. Cupp:  Let\u2019s go back. It\u2019s 2011, demonstrators in Daraa are killed by security forces. In just a couple months the Assad regime is killing civilians. What should we have done? McMullin: Immediately condemn it. That costs us very little if not nothing. We must always condemn atrocities, always, always, always. But as they develop, we have to send stronger messages. There\u2019s sanctions; if necessary we can use military force. There\u2019s an escalation plan. But we\u2019ve got the largest soap box in the world and if the American president stands on it and says we will not accept a massive atrocity, we\u2019re warning you Assad, do not pursue this avenue any further. The problem is we tend not to say those things and we\u2019ve squandered our credibility. I just want to share a quick story. When I was a senior adviser on national security issues to the House, I had a meeting one day with the most senior person dedicated to Syria at the State Department. This was at a time when there had been chemical weapons attacks. We\u2019d just discovered the use of chlorine bombs. I said to the diplomat, \u201cWhy isn\u2019t the administration more forcefully condemning these atrocities? The President isn\u2019t out there, the secretary of state isn\u2019t out there. Why is that?\u201d And their answer was, \u201cWe\u2019re afraid the media will then ask us what we\u2019re going to do about it.\u201d And I thought that was the saddest thing. Is this guy conservatives' answer to Trump? Cupp: Trump said in the last debate that Iran, Russia and Assad are killing ISIS, essentially repeating Syrian and Russian propaganda. We know this isn\u2019t true \u2013 is he uninformed or in bed with our enemies? McMullin: He is absolutely aligning himself with our enemies. He is an authoritarian. He has no respect for any check on his power. He has not experienced those checks in his own life. Or when he does experience it, he reacts violently to it. He would leverage our executive authority to deprive us of our own civil rights. He is absolutely one of them. Cupp: What about Trump\u2019s plan to steal Iraqi oil? Why wouldn\u2019t that work to starve ISIS? McMullin: It\u2019s hard to know where to start. First, it\u2019s a silly idea. It\u2019s a violation of the sovereignty of Iraq. We\u2019ve had this international system since World War I and World War II based on the idea of sovereignty, that borders cannot be changed by force, resources cannot be taken by force. It\u2019s the basic framework for the international system since the two great wars. Some people like Trump would say, what\u2019s that gotten us? Well, it\u2019s a period of time since the two great wars during which there haven\u2019t been further [great] wars. It\u2019s facilitated the spread of democracy around the world. At the time of World War I there were about 14 democracies, now there are about 100. It\u2019s led to the lifting out of poverty of 900 million people. What Trump proposes is a degradation of that order. There are still conflicts around the world, but the absence of great wars \u2013 Trump proposes to dismantle that. And that is exactly what Vladimir Putin wants, this would advance the interests of Putin and other expansionist authoritarians around the world. Putin also wants to see the idea of sovereignty challenged. He foments racial and ethnic tensions to nativists and nationalists, and attaches leaders to these movements, and then empowers those leaders. That turns countries in on themselves. They focus less on the world around them, and in the process the values of liberal democracies are eroded. Then we lose the moral high ground to criticize Russia for its actions. That moral high ground generates tremendous goodwill around the world for us, and it\u2019s a huge source of power. Countries want to work with us, do business with us, work on issues of national security, because of the good will that comes with those ideals. Vladimir Putin would like us to abandon those ideas because Putin, ISIS, they don\u2019t want us to have that moral high ground. Then they have a freer hand to advance their evil objectives. Trump's new troubles offer Clinton opening in Utah Cupp: I do want to also ask you about the election. Can you win? If not, what\u2019s the plan exactly? McMullin: We\u2019ve been very open and transparent about what we\u2019re trying to do. It would be great if we could win a majority of electoral college votes. We understand that barring some extraordinary situation, that\u2019s unlikely. So the next step would be to deny Trump and Hillary Clinton a majority. We depend on some variables that aren\u2019t in our control there, and that is how close the race between them is. If it happens to be very close, if we could win a state or two, we could potentially block both of them from the majority and the election then goes to the House of Representatives. We believe the election would reset, and I would have an opportunity to make my case to the American people. But we\u2019re also doing something else. We\u2019re standing for what is right and decent and true, when we believe no one else was. Cynical people in Washington dismiss that as being an effort without merit or value. But I couldn\u2019t disagree more. The abandonment of conservative ideals \u2013 universal ideals, like the idea we are all created equally and the cause of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness \u2013 those have been abandoned in this election. So we felt like we needed to step up.  In the process, we are building a new generation of leadership, a new conservative movement. And it\u2019s been incredible, the amount of traction we\u2019ve gotten on the grassroots level. Just since the tape [of Trump discussing grabbing women], engagement online has increased 10 times. People are sick of what they\u2019ve been offered. They\u2019ve been woken up by this terrible tape of Donald Trump, in which he talks about sexually assaulting women, they are waking up to what\u2019s wrong with him, and they\u2019re looking for other options. And many are finding a home with us.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Julian Zelizer is a professor of history and public affairs at Princeton University and a New America fellow. He is the author of \u201cJimmy Carter\u201d and \u201cThe Fierce Urgency of Now: Lyndon Johnson, Congress, and the Battle for the Great Society.\u201d The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. Julian Zelizer: It's too late for Republicans to realize what's been obvious Trump has wallowed in sexism and racism for years, Zelizer says Zelizer: The Trump train wreck is one of the Republicans' own making. Republicans are acting as if they are in a state of shock about their nominee. From the moment that the tape of Donald Trump and Billy Bush discussing women in vulgar terms surfaced on Friday, Republicans have been coming out of the woodwork to denounce his words, trying to separate themselves from his campaign. The Republican National Committee sent out an email to vendors saying they should put a \u201chold on all projects\u201d in a mailing program devoted to electing Trump. Sen. John McCain, who had backed Trump even though he had mocked his having been captured in war, has now withdrawn his support. A few called on him to step down. Even his wife Melania condemned the comments where Trump explained to Bush that his fame allowed him to \u201ckiss any woman\u201d and \u201cgrab them by the p\u2013sy\u201d as being \u201cunacceptable and offensive.\u201d Has Trump finally gone too far? The backlash has been so severe that Trump even felt the need to issue an apology, something that he has never before agreed to do. The moment feels a little bit like when Sen. Barry Goldwater of Arizona joined a group of senior Republicans in 1974 to tell President Richard Nixon that it was time to step down. That has remained a classic example of when the party establishment took a responsible stand for the good of the nation. But all of the Republican rhetoric over the past 24 hours seems a bit hypocritical to those who have been following the campaign. This is not the first time that Trump has made statements that are controversial and offensive. This has been a campaign that has seen sexism, nativism and Islamophobia front and center. He has mocked the physically disabled and played directly into the racial divisions of the nation. It has been a campaign where remarks that were once relegated to the fringes of American politics made it into mainstream. If the party really wants to deal with the Trump problem, they will need to do much more than castigate him for this recent tape. The party will need to look deeper to understand what allowed this kind of candidate to get this far. Look out, Clinton and Trump! Town hall format is a big risk Before he ran, Donald Trump started his foray into politics by joining the birther movement, talking on the networks about \u201ccredible\u201d sources that claimed President Obama\u2019s birth certificate was a \u201cfraud.\u201d The campaign, targeting the legitimacy of the nation\u2019s first African-American president, played off of the racial tensions of the nation. Even more recently, he called President Obama, as well as Secretary Hillary Clinton, founders of ISIS. When CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper asked Trump to denounce David Duke, the former KKK leader, who endorsed him, Trump said he didn\u2019t know anything about Duke or white supremacist groups. As Tapper pressed him on denouncing the KKK, he would not desist and refused to condemn a group that he said he didn\u2019t know enough about (he later blamed a bad earpiece). When he announced his candidacy Trump talked about the need to stop Mexicans from coming into the country with a wall. \u201cThey\u2019re bringing drugs. They\u2019re bringing crime. They\u2019re rapists. \u2026 And some, I assume, are good people.\u201d When asked to explain on CNN what he meant, he added that they were also \u201ckillers.\u201d Last summer he said that a federal judge presiding over a class action suit against Trump University was biased because \u201che\u2019s a Mexican.\u201d Head of Trump's religious advisory board dismisses vulgar remarks When he stood on stage and physically mocked a reporter with physical disabilities, many were stunned. Trump has called for a ban on all Muslims and a database with information about every Muslim in the country, even if he later walked back some of the comments. He has called for closing down every Islamic mosque. In July, in response to the horrendous attack at a nightclub in Orlando, he said that, \u201cWe cannot continue to allow thousands upon thousands of people to pour into our country, many of whom have the same thought process as this savage killer.\u201d Trump, caught boasting, finally uses the word \"apologize\" He even made provocative comments in defense of gun control that many saw as a veiled threat against Clinton. When he said in August that a Clinton presidency would threaten supporters of gun rights and there would be nothing to stop her, he added, \u201cAlthough the Second Amendment people, maybe there is, I don\u2019t know.\u201d After the Secret Service briefed him about the remarks, Trump would continue. One month later, Trump said, \u201cI think that her bodyguards should drop all weapons\u201d since she doesn\u2019t want other people to have guns. \u201cTake them, let\u2019s see what happens to her.\u201d And when it comes to women, the comments on the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape are really not so new. His comments in public have always been offensive when it comes to women. In 1991, Trump told Esquire magazine about female reporters that \u201cIt doesn\u2019t really matter what (they) write as long as you\u2019ve got a young and beautiful piece of ass.\u201d In a radio interview in 2004, Howard Stern asked Trump if he could call Ivanka \u201ca piece of ass.\u201d Trump said he didn\u2019t mind. In 2006 he turned heads again by joking on national television that if Ivanka was not his own daughter he would be dating her. \u201cArianna Huffington, is unattractive, both inside and out,\u201d he tweeted in 2012. \u201cI fully understand why her former husband left her for a man \u2013 he made a good decision.\u201d In 2013, he tweeted out another offensive thought: \u201c26,000 unreported sexual assaults in the military \u2013 only 238 convictions. What did these geniuses expect when they put men & women together?\u201d During the first Republican debate in August, when Megyn Kelly asked about Trump having called women \u201cfat pigs, dogs, slobs, disgusting animals,\u201d he said with a smile, \u201cOnly Rosie O\u2019Donnell.\u201d Complaining about her treatment of him in the debate, Trump later said Kelly had \u201cblood coming out of her wherever.\u201d Of Carly Fiorina, he asked, \u201cLook at that face. Would anybody vote for that?\u201d The comments have not stopped, right through his first debate with Clinton when he doubled down on his statements about O\u2019Donnell. And then there was the controversy over his insulting comments about Alicia Machado. Even as campaign experts warned Trump that he would cost Republicans the women\u2019s vote, his rhetoric didn\u2019t change. Yet throughout the election, a large portion of the Republican Party decided to stay silent or in many cases to still endorse his candidacy. The reasons for this support will need to be examined if the party is serious that this is not the kind of person or kind of ideas that they stand for. There are many reasons that the Republican Party allowed the nomination to move this far. The forces of polarization are so strong that many Republicans will support anyone on the top of the their ticket, regardless of who that person is, if they hold out the prospect of defeating Democrats. There are also elements of the Republican Party that have become increasingly influential that, in a rebellion against what they call political correctness, are open to politicians who employ rhetoric lashing out against different segments of society. Republicans have been grappling with the \u201cgender gap\u201d since the 1980 election, when their problems in dealing with issues related to women became clear. There is also a conservative media where the echo chamber is so strong that the space for pushback against politicians who go too far within their own ranks has weakened. It is too late for Republicans like Jeff Sessions or Mike Pence to suddenly express shock. It is too late for Republicans like Jeff Sessions or Mike Pence to suddenly express shock. Julian Zelizer The person on the \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape is very much the candidate that the party chose in 2016. When Speaker Paul Ryan denounced Trump and refused to join him at a campaign event in Wisconsin, it seemed somewhat odd given that Speaker Ryan had decided to accept the nominee after the long list of statements that he had already made. And even now, \u201csickened\u201d by Trump did not necessarily mean he would revoke his endorsement of his party\u2019s presidential candidate.  When some prominent figures like Mitt Romney implored their colleagues to take a different path in the summer, most of the party moved forward with Trump. The Trump train wreck is one of the Republicans\u2019 own making. Rather than saying they are in a state of shock or disbelief, Republicans who are truly unhappy with this candidate must look much deeper to really understand the state they are in, one that got them to this point just one month before the presidential election.",

He is the author of several books, most recently \u201cStokely: A Life.\u201d The views expressed here are his. Peniel Joseph: Crutcher's death is exactly the kind of state-sanctioned violence protesters are demonstrating against Whoever the next president is, he or she must protect and prioritize the lives of black people, writes Joseph Americans have become numb to the spectacle of racially tinged violence that lights up social media with unnerving frequency. The latest videotaped police killing of an unarmed black American occurred in Tulsa, Oklahoma on Friday, when officer Betty Shelby shot 40-year-old Terence Crutcher after his SUV broke down. Since the shooting, Shelby has since been placed on paid administrative leave. The Justice Department has launched an investigation into the shooting to see if Crutcher\u2019s federal civil rights were violated and Tulsa\u2019s police chief has promised a full investigation with complete transparency. Meanwhile, the Crutcher family is left to protest and grieve over the latest example of anti-black violence by law enforcement. As the Crutcher family mourns in Tulsa, violence erupted in Charlotte, North Carolina on Tuesday night after police shot and killed Keith Lamont Scott, a black man, while attempting to serve a warrant on a different person. Police contend this latest victim brandished a gun. His family insists he was simply reading a book as he sat in a car. Terence Crutcher's mother: 'He was my compassionate son' In Tulsa, Terence Crutcher\u2019s senseless death, captured by an officer\u2019s dash cam and a police helicopter, is exactly the kind of state-sanctioned violence against black bodies that protesters have been demonstrating against in the streets and on football fields. But the responsibility for addressing Crutcher\u2019s death and preventing future such deaths lies as much with the citizens actively protesting the injustice as it does with the politicians currently in and running for office. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, recognizing her campaign\u2019s vital need for a massive black turnout in November\u2019s election, discussed the shooting on Tuesday, calling Crutcher\u2019s death an \u201cunbearable\u201d act that should be \u201cintolerable.\u201d \u201cMaybe I can, by directly speaking to white people,\u201d Clinton continued, \u201csay, look this is not who we are,\u201d and enact police reforms to end these killings. Unfortunately, for much of American history, unjustified and unavenged murder of black people has been exactly who we are. Civil rights activists reimagined the contours of American democracy by seeking legal, legislative and policy changes capable of promoting racial justice, economic equality and black citizenship, but their lofty ambitions bumped squarely into the nation\u2019s long history of violence and exploitation of black bodies. Clinton plans to develop national standards to manage police shootings The criminal justice system that Clinton acknowledges needs to be dramatically transformed remains a gateway to multiple forms of racial oppression. For poor black Americans, police presence in public schools, the disproportionate punishment of black school children and zero-tolerance policies all provide communities with evidence that they reside in another country. Black America is frequently discussed as a cautionary tale or a fever dream out of Donald Trump\u2019s imagination, a land plagued by \u201cblack on black crime,\u201d poverty, violence and social ills that are somehow always disconnected from the institutional racism, economic violence, racial profiling and policy decisions that gave rise to them in the first place. Inspired by #BlackLivesMatter protests, the police killing of African Americans and her genuine need to stoke black voter turnout, Hillary Clinton has openly discussed the existence of institutional racism, offering policy changes that place her to the left of the Obama administration on issues of criminal justice reform. All the while, Crutcher\u2019s death in Tulsa competes for oxygen in a media landscape dominated by a presidential election, fears of domestic terrorism that have gripped the nation, and efforts to discredit Black Lives Matter protests. This is both unfortunate and in keeping with longstanding practice. America\u2019s racial justice movements have always confronted the forces of denial that proclaim racism to be a thing of the past, a figment of the wild imaginings of unpatriotic grievance peddlers, the modern day counterparts of the communist and socialist ghosts of a now forgotten era. Fatigue over the very idea of racial justice continues to haunt the American soul. Black Lives Matter activists, like their civil rights era predecessors, did not invent the politics and practices of white supremacy that have shaped virtually every facet of the national past and present. They have only tried, through non-violent demonstrations, social media actions and a bold policy agenda, to ensure that America\u2019s future breaks with its profoundly dispiriting legacies of slavery, Jim Crow and racial discrimination. President Barack Obama recently proclaimed that if black people did not turn out to vote in robust numbers for Clinton, he would take it as \u201ca personal insult\u201d against his political legacy as the nation\u2019s first black president. Noting that \u201cour progress is on the ballot,\u201d Obama urged African Americans to view the 2016 election in very personal terms. Black voters have been Obama\u2019s most loyal constituency, sometimes to a fault, turning an extraordinary 2008 turnout into historic levels of participation four years later. Black Lives Matter, but only if they're American Yet Obama\u2019s victory, perhaps not surprisingly but still disappointingly, proved insufficient to confront the systemic and structural nature of racial oppression in America. The Age of Ferguson, Baltimore and Milwaukee happened not because, but in spite of Obama\u2019s presence in the White House.  It\u2019s certainly understandable that Obama seeks to protect his remarkable legacy. But placing the onus on black voters is the wrong formula. In a democracy, citizenship is a sacred trust based on mutual responsibility of active citizens and responsive and accountable politicians, circumstances that blacks have never been afforded. I believe another world is possible, though. One where a president, irrespective of color, prioritizes the lives of black people and ensures no more Terence Crutchers are shot down in the street for breathing while black in America.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Doug Sosnik, who served as a senior adviser to President Bill Clinton for six years, is a Democratic strategist. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his. Doug Sosnik says Clinton has an advantage due to the belief Trump isn't qualified Democrats retain their edge in the Electoral College, Sosnik says Debates rarely alter the dynamics of an election, he says If you tune into the news these days it would be easy to conclude that the presidential race is too close to call and that it\u2019s all going to come down to what happens in the debates that start Monday. But that would be missing the point. The fact is that the likely outcome of this election was set in the spring and nothing major has changed since then to alter it. It\u2019s true that the debates will be significant, if for no other reason because they are the only \u201cmain events\u201d left in the campaign. But it\u2019s also true that they aren\u2019t likely to substantially impact the presidential election outcome. The last time a presidential debate tipped an election was in 1976 when President Ford mistakenly asserted that there was no Soviet domination of Eastern Europe. That mistake stalled the momentum that he had been building up until that point against Jimmy Carter. And even when candidates have dominated presidential debates \u2013 like Mitt Romney did in 2012 \u2013 it hasn\u2019t translated into much on Election Day. Romney still lost by four points. Heading into the first debate, even Hillary Clinton\u2019s most ardent supporters would admit that she has had a rough couple of weeks with the polls tightening. However, the basic structure and fundamentals of the race haven\u2019t changed since early spring, and they are unlikely to do so in the remaining 43 days of the election. The fact remains that an overwhelming number of Americans don\u2019t think Donald Trump is qualified to become president of the United States. Throughout the campaign Clinton has maintained a narrow but consistent lead in national polls and in key swing states. Clinton\u2019s lead widened following her nearly flawless political convention and Trump\u2019s chaotic August. Her recent drop in the polls is merely a return to the previous levels established earlier in the year. An overwhelming number of Americans don\u2019t think Donald Trump is qualified to become president of the United States. Doug Sosnik Clinton also continues to enjoy an even bigger advantage in amassing the 270 electoral votes necessary to win the election. Since 1992, Democrats have had a significant structural advantage in the Electoral College and 2016 looks to be no different. While Clinton enjoys a wide variety of paths to get to 270, Trump has almost no margin of error and really has only two plausible routes to victory. Both paths run through Florida, Ohio and North Carolina; winning those would get Trump to 253 electoral votes. From there, he would need Pennsylvania or a combination of smaller states, such as Nevada, Colorado, Iowa, New Hampshire and Maine\u2019s second congressional district. Debate coach: Expect Clinton vs. Trump to be an Olympic battle of wits The tight race reflected in the national polls is symptomatic of the deep divisions in our country that run along ideological, generational and racial lines. In this kind of polarized environment, it\u2019s an uphill battle for any candidate to open up a sizable lead and maintain it over an extended period of time. These divisions have been reflected in Obama\u2019s job approval ratings for the past seven years. Since the summer of 2009, Obama\u2019s job approval has consistently remained within a very narrow band \u2013 never dropping below 40% or rising above 53%. The enduring coalition of anti-Obama voters has formed the basis for Trump\u2019s support. And, as Trump has shown, with that built-in base of support, there\u2019s very little he can say or do that will drop his support below 40% in a two-way race. His recent rise in the polls is due largely to his consolidation of Republican support. The down-ballot impact of this consolidation is clear as the GOP\u2019s chances of holding the Senate have increased significantly since Labor Day. Despite Trump\u2019s relatively high floor, he also has a low ceiling. That\u2019s due to the changing demographics of the electorate (particularly in a presidential year) and Trump\u2019s unrelenting attacks and slurs targeted to many of these voter groups. Trump\u2019s failure to capture significant support from African-American, Hispanic and Asian voters has essentially kept his ceiling from budging. Whenever there has been tightening in the race it has been largely attributable to a drop in the Clinton vote, rather than a Trump surge.  At this point in the race Trump is unlikely to alter the fundamental structure of the campaign. His best chance of winning is based on a low-turnout electorate that doesn\u2019t reflect the views of a majority of Americans who don\u2019t want to see him in the White House. As we enter the final stretch of what seems like an endless campaign, if the \u201cNever Trump\u201d coalition wants to truly keep Trump out of the White House, it\u2019s time they shift their attention away from criticizing Clinton and toward ensuring that Election Day turnout reflects the will of the majority that holds Donald Trump in complete disdain and repudiates all that he represents.",

The opinions expressed in this commentary are his. Rana Sodhi lost two of his of brothers to acts of hate Rana Sodhi: The only way to combat further bigotry and senseless violence is to deploy relentless love and optimism On September 11, I mourned for the thousands killed in the terrorist attacks that struck our nation 15 years ago. Today, I mourn for my sibling, whose life was also taken far too early by the hands of hatred. My brother Balbir Singh Sodhi was murdered in Arizona on September 15, 2001. He was the first victim of a hate crime in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks on September 11. The man who murdered him, and who is now serving life in prison for that crime, called himself a patriot. Less than a year later, my brother Sukhpal was shot in the back and killed while driving a taxi. (Though it was never investigated as a hate crime, my family suspects otherwise.) Like me, my brothers wore turbans as part of our Sikh faith. Our turbans represent our commitment to love, equality and justice. These values serve us in our faith and also as Americans. However, since September 11, our turbans have marked us as targets for hate. The threat of violence is now a daily part of our lives as Sikh Americans, just as it is for our Muslim brothers and sisters. After the deaths of my brothers, I had a choice: to allow my fear and anger to consume me or to hear the call to love. I chose love. My Sikh faith teaches me to live in the spirit of \u201cchardi kala,\u201d relentless love and optimism even in the face of suffering and injustice. I have discovered that love can save us from despair and inspire us to live a life of service and social action. America needs the ethic of love now more than ever. This election season, we have seen an alarming escalation of hate and bigotry in our nation \u2013 on our airwaves, in our streets, in our schools and online. I believe the Sikh spirit of revolutionary love and optimism can offer our fellow Americans a source of hope in an era of mass violence. It begins with hearing our story. 15 years after 9/11, Sikhs still victims of anti-Muslim hate crimes The Sikh story in America began more than 125 years ago. The first Sikhs arrived on the West Coast as farmers and laborers at the turn of the century, searching for the American dream. Many of them faced racial discrimination and a legal system that denied them citizenship on the basis of their skin color. But they still believed in the promise of America. In recent decades, families like mine settled here to escape religious persecution in India. Sadly, our turbans have always made us the target for racism, even in our home country. But the terrorist attacks on September 11 ushered in a new reality. Since then, we routinely face school bullying, employment discrimination and racial profiling. Today, Sikhs, along with our Muslim brothers and sisters, are disproportionately more likely to be targets of hate crimes than we were before that fateful day. We have been tested over and over. In August 2012, a decade after my brother Sukhpal was killed, a white supremacist entered a Sikh house of worship in Oak Creek, Wisconsin, on a Sunday morning and opened fire. He killed six people, people who looked exactly like my brothers. Volunteers help temple mourners cope While the horror of this mass shooting devastated us, my family and community refused the narrative of victimhood. Since then, we have used online platforms to tell our story and broadcast our message of love and optimism. In this spirit, we have stood in solidarity with other communities, especially in the wake of the mass shootings at a black church in Charleston, South Carolina, and gay nightclub in Orlando. To be sure, love is not enough without action. It\u2019s not enough to feel love in your heart for your neighbors. We need the kind of love that inspires us to stand up against bigotry in all forms: in school, at the workplace, online, at the kitchen table and in the voting booth. My family\u2019s story is told in the documentary film \u201cDivided We Fall,\u201d re-released this month by the The Sikh Coalition and Revolutionary Love Project, to spark conversations on campuses and communities across the nation. The goal is to hold at least 100 film screenings and dialogues on how to combat hate with love this election season. The stakes have never been higher.  After my brother died, we hung a single handmade sign over the doorway of his gas station: EVIL TRIUMPHS WHEN GOOD PEOPLE DO NOTHING. As we witness the most vitriolic election cycle in modern American history, too many have been emboldened to act on their hate. Now it\u2019s up to the rest of us to act on our love.

Wade was senior adviser and national director for African-American vote for Obama for America and deputy chief of staff for U.S. Secretary of Commerce Gary Locke. He has endorsed Hillary Clinton in this year\u2019s Democratic campaign. Wade is an entrepreneur and president of a global business development firm. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his. Rick C. Wade: Donald Trump has yet to show a real understanding of the plight of the African-American electorate If he wants to win black voters, Trump will need to offer prescriptive solution to socioeconomic imbalances in America Last week, Donald Trump, running as Savior-in-Chief, tried to appeal to the African-American electorate by attending his first black church, Detroit\u2019s Great Faith Ministries. Though it took him long enough, at least Trump finally spoke to black folks rather than past them. That said, he has yet to show any real understanding of the plight of African-Americans or to lay out a comprehensive plan to address their concerns. Given his racist history \u2013 from being sued for housing discrimination in the 1970s to embracing avowed white supremacists in the present day \u2013 he has some serious work to do if he wants to win over African-American voters. The problem is, in addition to Trump\u2019s checkered past, he has done little to woo black voters since declaring his candidacy \u2013 and he has had plenty of opportunities, beginning with the primary in South Carolina, where blacks account for nearly 30% of the population. If Trump was serious about education reform, he could have visited crumbling, underfunded and predominantly black schools along Interstate 95 known as the \u201cCorridor of Shame\u201d and unveiled his plan for America\u2019s public schools. If he was committed to helping minority businesses, he could have toured manufacturing plants in Greenville and explained his plan for expanding their access to capital and corporate supply chains. If he was sincere about healing divisions, he could have worshiped at Mother Emmanuel AME Church in Charleston, where a man who police said wanted to start a race war admitted killing nine churchgoers, including the pastor \u2013 my friend and state senator Clementa Pinckney \u2013 and talked about racial reconciliation. But Trump did none of those things. And since then, Trump also declined invitations to speak before the National Urban League, the NAACP and the National Association of Black Journalists. To date, Trump\u2019s only major pronouncement has been the need for a \u201ccivil rights agenda for our time,\u201d but he has failed to offer one, except a call to fight crime and expand charter schools. While seeking to temper his racially divisive image to center-right whites and suburban moms, he has reinforced the very stereotypes that blacks have worked for decades to overcome. Everyone is not impoverished, uneducated, jobless and getting shot. Surely the Trump campaign didn\u2019t believe that his outreach strategy \u2013 void of apologizing for his condescending tone or offering any prescriptive policy solutions \u2013 would increase his support among blacks. Today\u2019s African-Americans are too smart to fall for that \u201cokey-doke.\u201d They are more sophisticated and knowledgeable, rightfully expecting candidates to earn their votes. Millennials, in particular, are more analytical and independent, less likely to engage in group think. They stay dialed in on politics through social media, and are more interested in accountability on issues like criminal justice reform than traditional church stump speeches. Still, the most important, lasting way to win black voters is by building trusting, respectful relationships and addressing their needs. Despite job growth, the unemployment rate is 9.5% for African-Americans \u2013 twice the national average \u2013 and 6.6% for Hispanics. According to the Corporation for Economic Development and the Institute for Policy Studies, at this rate it will take black households 228 years and Hispanic households 84 years to close the wealth gap with whites. Baltimore, Detroit and Chicago are all recent portraits of America\u2019s racial and socioeconomic imbalance. Crime and violence, widespread across segregated black neighborhoods, is rooted in concentrated poverty. With these problems staring him squarely in the face, Trump, up to now, has looked the other way. What Trump gets wrong on immigrants and crime Let me be clear: It would be unfair and unrealistic to expect a president to singlehandedly heal America\u2019s socioeconomic ills. But we should expect our president to have a plan to ensure everyone has a seat at America\u2019s economic table. What minorities need is not more rhetoric and research, but policies that drive private investment to their communities to develop high-growth enterprises and raise wages, in sectors such as energy, technology and manufacturing. Clinton gets that, and has proposed a thoughtful Economic Revitalization Initiative, which includes $50 billion to create jobs in struggling communities, $20 billion to support youth jobs, $5 billion for prison re-entry programs, and $25 billion to support entrepreneurs and increase private investment in underserved communities. As successful a businessman as he claims to be, Trump should have gotten it long ago. But it\u2019s not too late for him to demonstrate leadership. He can start by committing to improve his own company\u2019s record \u2013 increasing the number of blacks at executive levels, building businesses in minority communities and hiring minority contractors. Then, he could lay out a plan that includes freeing up capital for minority-owned businesses, incentives for large companies to locate in distressed areas, pathways for more minority-owned firms to do government work and access foreign markets, and investments in STEM, entrepreneurship and job training. Many have framed this election as a disturbing and negative result of America\u2019s ongoing racial and ethnic transformation. But minorities represent more than votes. They are key drivers of America\u2019s economy and the future of the country\u2019s workforce, which has been changing far more significantly than its politics for the past four decades.  By 2020, the white working-age population will have declined by 19 percentage points. The minority working-age population will have doubled to 37% \u2013 and during the next president\u2019s term. The fact that minorities will make up more than a third of the workforce means our next president must address the economic conditions of people of color. So while Trump swayed to the choir music at Great Faith Ministries and praised black Christians, it is not enough. He has to \u201cwalk the walk\u201d with African-Americans. He has a long road to travel \u2013 and little time to get there. Rick C.

Follow him @TheDeansreport. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his. Dean Obeidallah: Larry Wilmore's show was only late-night talk show using humor to offer a black perspective to broad audience He says in a time of racial tensions in U.S., his show offered necessary platform for minority voices, issues. Netflix, Hulu, take note Protesters are in the streets in Milwaukee, as years of racial tensions surface after a police shooting.  A presidential candidate wants to push brown immigrants out of the country.  An entire Black Lives Matter movement takes hold over the issue of police profiling and inequality \u2014 a reflection of how America is once again in the grips of a profound struggle over race. So Comedy Central cancels Larry Wilmore\u2019s show? It\u2019s a terrible idea. America needs Larry Wilmore on TV more today than ever.  Wilmore, as the only African-American late-night comedy  host, was also the only one in late night uniquely qualified to help people \u2013 especially white people in America \u2013 make sense of what is going on with non-white people in America. (\u201cThe Daily Show\u2019s\u201d Trevor Noah is not African American, he was born and raised in South Africa and only moved to the United States in recent years.) But Comedy Central executives apparently believed that was not enough, announcing the cancellation of Wilmore show, effective this Thursday.  True, the show\u2019s ratings were below than that of his predecessor, Stephen Colbert, in the time slot. But that only means the show was not a good fit for Comedy Central \u2013 not that the show isn\u2019t a good fit for our nation on another cable network or on a digital platform. Netflix or Hulu, are you listening? Here is why you should. Wilmore is not a 25-year-old guy made to order by TV execs to appeal to the all-important young, male viewer demographic.   But he is the guy those young viewers need to hear from \u2014 a man in his 50s whose jokes about race and politics ring trenchant and true because we know he has lived through these issues. That\u2019s why when Wilmore recently did a focus group with six African-Americans who were genuinely supporting Donald Trump it resonated so powerfully \u2014 and was so funny \u2013 when Wilmore asked, \u201cWhat the f*** are you thinking?\u201d The awkward race issue Milwaukee shooting raises And Wilmore, who created TV hits such as \u201cThe Bernie Mac Show\u201d and was showrunner on \u201cBlack-ish,\u201d had the credibility to go after Bill Cosby over his sex scandal in a way that other late-night hosts could not.  He didn\u2019t just make it clear that he believed Cosby was guilty, he even called for Cosby to stop his comedy tour, because it was in poor taste to continue. Wilmore showed a clip of Cosby dealing with a heckler at a recent standup show by  telling the heckler: \u201cShush..shush..Stop it.\u201d To which Wilmore responded, \u201c\u2018Shush\u2026shush\u2026stop it\u2019?! Are you trying to quiet a heckler, or is that your pillow talk?!\u201d Join us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion Wilmore took on issues of racism in all areas, from police misconduct cases to the practice of leaving people of color out of media panels discussing the situation in their own community. Last year he went after Fox News\u2019 Bill O\u2019Reilly for, incredibly, having a discussion about Black Lives Matter with just white people on his panel. Wilmore remedied the situation by gleefully \u201cinserting\u201d himself into the show and correcting \u2014 hilariously \u2013 the inaccurate blather of a panelist playing down American racism, and then finished up with a takedown of O\u2019Reilly for making light of slavery. But Wilmore didn\u2019t just address black and white issues on his show. He stood up for other minority communities as well. In fact the original title of the show was \u201cThe Minority Report\u201d and it was intended to be a platform for minority voices \u2013 the type usually ignored or tokenized by mainstream media. (The name of the show had to be changed because Fox TV was developing a TV version of the movie, \u201cThe Minority Report.\u201d) I appeared on Wilmore\u2019s show three times and was part of a test show before it premiered.  We discussed issues \u2014 often concerning the Muslim American community \u2014 in a way that was both funny and, hopefully, thought provoking. On one show we had a brutally honest discussion about the made-up term \u201cradical Islam\u201d and how it\u2019s laughable to hear Trump and others on the right, say, in effect, that if President Obama would simply use that term, the guys in ISIS would respond: \u201cUh\u2013oh, they got us \u2013 time to shut it all down.\u201d   In contrast we see cable news shows discuss this term without ever demanding Trump and his surrogates define exactly what it means. (Spoiler alert: They can\u2019t.) On Wilmore\u2019s show Monday, after it was announced the show would come to end, Wilmore joked: \u201cOur show going off the air has to only mean one thing: Racism is solved.\u201d Obviously, far from it.  Losing Wilmore\u2019s show \u2014 which took on the tough issues about race in a way that made us laugh, think and learn \u2014 doesn\u2019t help us get any closer to that goal. And if other networks are smart, they will get this man back on the air before this election is over, because his is a voice we could really use right now.",

The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. Errol Louis: Obama's appeal to his coalition to pass baton to Clinton is key to her success To win, she'll need strong turnout from African-American voters and independents, he says It\u2019s only fitting that President Obama\u2019s blockbuster speech in support of Hillary Clinton was delivered 12 years to the day after he burst onto the national stage at the 2004 Democratic convention in Boston. To win the presidency this fall, Clinton must inherit, energize, expand and mobilize the Obama coalition, a unique potent alliance that represents a key part of the President\u2019s legacy \u2013 and Clinton\u2019s best hope for victory in November. Behind the soaring oratory was a plea to Obama\u2019s core supporters \u2013 the black, Latino, college-educated, women and independent voters that put him in the White House \u2013 to transfer their loyalty to Clinton. \u201cTonight, I ask you to do for Hillary Clinton what you did for me,\u201d Obama told the crowd of 20,000 at the Wells Fargo Center. \u201cI ask you to carry her the same way you carried me. Because you\u2019re who I was talking about 12 years ago, when I talked about hope \u2013 it\u2019s been you who\u2019ve fueled my dogged faith in our future, even when the odds are great; even when the road is long.\u201d It\u2019s her surest way to win, given Obama\u2019s healthy approval rating, currently around 50%, and his enduring appeal to black women voters, a pillar of the Democratic Party that boasts a sky-high 74% participation rate, higher than any other racial or ethnic subgroup. Clinton will need a similarly high turnout by black voters to win. The Cook Political Report analyzed Obama\u2019s re-election numbers in 2012 and concluded: \u201cAfrican-American voters accounted for Obama\u2019s entire margin of victory in seven states: Florida, Maryland, Michigan, Nevada, Ohio, Pennsylvania and Virginia. Without these states\u2019 112 electoral votes, Obama would have lost decisively. African-Americans also accounted for almost all of Obama\u2019s margin in Wisconsin.\u201d Two other parts of the Obama coalition, liberal Republicans and independent voters, got a targeted appeal from former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg, a billionaire and ex-Democrat who won the mayoralty running as a Republican and an independent (under New York election rules, candidates can run on more than one party line). \u201cI know what it\u2019s like to have neither party fully represent my views or values,\u201d Bloomberg said, acknowledging that his appeal was targeted not at the assembled Democrats of the convention, but to Republicans and independents watching on television. \u201cThere are times when I disagree with Hillary. But whatever our disagreements may be, I\u2019ve come here to say: We must put them aside for the good of our country,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd we must unite around the candidate who can defeat a dangerous demagogue\u201d \u2013 that last line a jab at Donald Trump. Join us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion. A third part of the Obama coalition, Latino voters, are key supporters of Obamacare; according to one recent poll, 54% of them want the next president to continue the health care initiative. That is why Clinton, who wants to carry heavily Latino swing states like Florida, Nevada and Colorado, strongly defended Obamacare against Sen. Bernie Sanders. With just over 100 days to go before Election Day, expect Clinton to cling to black, independent and Latino voters like a life preserver \u2013 because, politically speaking, that is what they are.",

Thursday, after a tumultuous primary campaign, Donald Trump formally accepted the 2016 Republican presidential nomination Charles Kaiser: The stakes are higher than they've ever been, as Americans inch one step closer to the brink of political disaster America has always relied upon the latest wave of immigrants to reinvent and reinvigorate these United States. For those of us who were raised in that faith \u2013 and there are millions of us \u2013 nothing could be more offensive than the detritus shoveled out for 76 minutes by Donald J. Trump at the Republican National Convention last week. Smug, unctuous, fueled by hatred and obsessed with fear: These were the shining qualities of Trump\u2019s acceptance speech on Thursday night. Its naked pandering to prejudice was worse than anything since Pat Buchanan\u2019s culture wars speech at the Republican convention 24 years ago. No other major party candidate of modern times has ever appealed so directly to America\u2019s dark side. And Trump\u2019s willingness to repeatedly scapegoat minorities is a haunting echo of the worst demagoguery of the 1930s. There is no difference in intent between his references to Muslims and Hitler\u2019s references to Jews. Naturally, white supremacists like David Duke (who Trump has not always been eager to condemn) were ecstatic with this approach: \u201cGreat Trump Speech,\u201d Duke tweeted. \u201cAmerica First! Stop Wars! Defeat the Corrupt elites! Protect our Borders! Fair Trade! Couldn\u2019t have said it better!\u201d After being widely denounced for his previous silence, Trump now acknowledges the need to disavow Duke. Nonetheless, Trump\u2019s address was a toxic combination of unprovable claims \u2013 \u201cexcessive regulation is costing our country as much as $2 trillion a year\u201d and ending it will \u201cproduce more than $20 trillion in job-creating economic activity\u201d \u2013 and outright lies \u2013 \u201cMy opponent wants to essentially abolish the Second Amendment.\u201d What's fueling the Republican fury The Republican nominee repeated his belief that \u201cNATO is obsolete.\u201d Hours earlier, he told The New York Times he found nothing sacred about America\u2019s decades-old pledge to defend any NATO member whose borders are threatened by Russia. That cavalier pronouncement prompted this pithy summary from Jeffrey Goldberg for The Atlantic: Trump \u201chas chosen \u2026 to unmask himself as a de facto agent of Russian President Vladimir Putin, a KGB-trained dictator who seeks to rebuild the Soviet empire by undermining the free nations of Europe, marginalizing NATO and ending America\u2019s reign as the world\u2019s sole superpower.\u201d In any other year, Trump\u2019s Putin-loving, Mexican-and-Muslim-bashing rhetoric would have disqualified him as a serious candidate right from the start. After all, in previous presidential elections, what now look like minor misdemeanors \u2013 Howard Dean\u2019s \u201cscream\u201d after the Iowa caucuses in 2004, Joe Biden\u2019s plagiarism in 1988 or  Ed Muskie\u2019s \u201ctears\u201d in 1972 (which were really New Hampshire snowflakes melting on his cheeks) \u2013 were all ruled fatally disqualifying by the big-footers of the national press corps. But this year, the nonstop outrages of the Republican presidential nominee and the never-ending character assassination of Hillary Clinton have produced a press paralysis unlike anything I have witnessed in 14 previous presidential contests. Trump careens so quickly from one outrage to another \u2013 one day he\u2019s praising Putin and Kim Jong-un, the next day he\u2019s implying that Ted Cruz\u2019s father was Lee Harvey Oswald\u2019s ally \u2013 that reporters cannot focus on any single atrocity. Meanwhile, buried by congressional Benghazi investigations and over-the-top comments by FBI Director James Comey about her \u201ccareless\u201d but clearly noncriminal handling of her emails, Clinton\u2019s substantive accomplishments as secretary of state are completely ignored.  Last week Trump blithely renounced America\u2019s role as a moral leader abroad, when he told The New York Times that America had no right to criticize the behavior of other countries. \u201cWhen the world looks at how bad the United States is, and then we go and talk about civil liberties, I don\u2019t think we\u2019re a very good messenger,\u201d he said. America must not succumb to anger, hatred, division In contrast, Clinton used her influence to free political prisoners everywhere from Uzbekistan, where she successfully pressed President Islam Karimov for the release of its poet laureate, Yusuf Juma, to Myanmar, where she and her assistant secretary for human rights, Michael Posner, persuaded the government to release 1,100 prisoners as part of the re-engagement between the Mynanmar and American governments. Clinton also made history with an unprecedented speech in Switzerland in 2011, when she declared, \u201cLike being a woman, like being a racial, religious, tribal, or ethnic minority, being LGBT does not make you less human. And that is why gay rights are human rights, and human rights are gay rights.\u201d But the differences don\u2019t just stop at foreign policy. Trump displays a pristine ignorance of almost every major issue of our time, while Clinton is steeped in the details of every issue from pre-K education to the clear and present dangers of global warming. And yet, because they both have high unfavorable ratings with different parts of the electorate, much of the press persists in making false equivalencies between them. As Barack Obama said of Clinton, \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s ever been someone so qualified to hold this office.\u201d After her previous eight years in the White House, eight years in the Senate and four years at the State Department, she would have the easiest learning curve any new president has ever had. But in this upside-down year, Clinton\u2019s lifelong immersion in government is often portrayed as her greatest defect, while her opponent literally has no experience of governing at all. On Saturday, Tim Kaine did a splendid job of drawing that contrast in his first speech after Clinton announced he would be her running mate. Kaine\u2019s optimism and openness were the perfect antidote to Trump\u2019s Darth Vader vision of America. Those who knew Trump first and know him best, like author Tony Schwartz, who penned his best-seller, \u201cThe Art of the Deal,\u201d have no doubt about the likely consequences of Trump\u2019s inexperience. Schwartz told Jane Mayer of The New Yorker, \u201cI genuinely believe if Trump wins and gets the nuclear codes there is an excellent possibility it will lead to the end of civilization.\u201d Charles Kaiser is the author of \u201c1968 in America,\u201d \u201cThe Gay Metropolis\u201d and, most recently, \u201cThe Cost of Courage.\u201d The opinions expressed in this commentary are his.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Rabbi Shai Held, a leading Jewish theologian and educator, is co-founder and dean of the Hadar Institute and the author of \u201cAbraham Joshua Heschel: The Call of Transcendence.\u201d The opinions expressed in this commentary are his. Rabbi Shai Held: All men were created equal, but not all men are treated equally. White indifference towards racial discrimination of African-Americans only helps racial tensions increase, he says. From its founding, the United States professed that \u201call men are created equal,\u201d and from its founding, it made a mockery of this core value. People of color were treated as chattel, derided as \u201csavages\u201d and enslaved and degraded at every turn. It is one of the tragic ironies of human history: We don\u2019t usually oppress those we see as fully human. So first we dehumanize, and then we feel licensed to oppress. The United States has undeniably made progress, but we have also gotten profoundly stuck. Many of us dreamed that the election of an African-American president would usher in a new era, one in which the dreams of Martin Luther King, Jr. and so many others would finally be fulfilled. Yet bigoted demagogues insisted, against all evidence to the contrary, that our first black president simply couldn\u2019t be a real American. The loudest and most repugnant of them is now the Republican nominee for president. Sadly, electing a black man unleashed America\u2019s racial subconscious like nothing else could, and what we are now witnessing is ugly, frightening and frankly devastating. But leave the president aside. The bodies of African-American men keep piling up, killed by police officers for nothing, it seems, besides being black. White America has made progress since the days of slavery, but it has not yet come to see, feel and believe that all human beings (not just men) are created equal, and that black people are no less human than white people. If you\u2019re white and you don\u2019t believe that white privilege is real, talk to an African-American parent about \u201cthe conversation,\u201d in which they teach their children to be cautious and tentative around officers of the law. And if you don\u2019t believe that white privilege is real, you aren\u2019t looking hard enough. I had an experience not long ago that is seared into my consciousness. I participated in a nonviolent protest on the Upper West Side of Manhattan after a group of New York City police officers had killed Eric Garner. As he was about to arrest me, a police officer looked at the prayer shawl I was wearing and gingerly asked, \u201cSir, is it OK if I touch this?\u201d I almost broke into tears. The contrast between the treatment I, a well-connected white man, received, and the treatment Eric Garner, a poor African-American man, received, has haunted me every day since. There are concrete issues to address about police brutality and accountability. But there is also a much more fundamental issue to confront: do white Americans really believe that African-American people matter, and matter just as much as they do? I\u2019m a rabbi, and in moments like this I turn to the Bible for guidance and inspiration. Over the past few days, I\u2019ve been unable to stop thinking about this: In the first chapter of Genesis, as God proceeds through the work of creation, the Bible repeatedly draws our attention to the dazzling variety of what God makes. Genesis 1 reads like a hymn to biodiversity: God does not just create vegetation, God creates vegetation \u201cof every kind\u201d; God does not just create animals, God creates animals \u201cof every kind.\u201d Similarly with sea creatures, birds and beasts, the Bible seems to revel in the breathtaking multifariousness of God\u2019s creation. As we progress through the chapter, we come to expect that everything God brings into existence will be created in stunning and multi-colored diversity. The Baton Rouge photograph that everyone is talking about But then comes the creation of the human being, and suddenly we hear nothing at all about diversity. The omission is striking \u2013 the Bible is suggesting that in contrast to vegetation and the (rest of the) animal kingdom, there simply are no kinds of human beings. We are all descended from Adam, the ancestor to us all. Only after we establish that fact, can we safely, responsibly, go on to celebrate and defend human diversity. Jews don\u2019t just read the Bible, though; we also read our traditional commentators. One of the most startling comments in the history of Judaism is that of Rabbi Abraham ibn Ezra, who observes that in the eyes of God, there is ultimately no distinction between \u201cthose who oppress\u201d and \u201cthose who witness the oppression and keep silent.\u201d This is haunting, and daunting, but more importantly, it is intensely demanding. In a society where some are oppressed, all are implicated. We are all implicated in deeper ways as well. As American citizens, we do not have the privilege of standing outside and asking whether or not we should get involved. The police in this country work for us, for all of us \u2014 they often do wonderful, courageous and exemplary work \u2014 and their actions thus involve and implicate us. Just as we celebrate the enormous good that they do, we are ashamed when their behavior is far less than exemplary. Join us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion. Ibn Ezra\u2019s question, then, ought to be ours: As human dignity is trodden and trampled upon again and again (and again), what will we do?  We have the psychological ability to turn away, but we have the moral obligation to respond and take action. All human beings are created equal, but we are not treated equally. As the Bible reminds us, there is no \u201cwe\u201d and \u201cthey\u201d here; there is only humanity. We are all involved, and we are all implicated. The only question is whether and when we will all respond. The hour is late, the time is now.",

Her latest book is \u201cItalian Fascism\u2019s Empire Cinema.\u201d The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. Ruth Ben-Ghiat: Mitt Romney accused Donald Trump of creating 'trickle-down' racism. She says history offers many examples She says Trump's bigotry emboldens racists. She was victim of a surge of anti-Semitic slurs on Twitter How do people become racists? How is bigotry spread and sustained in society? Mitt Romney\u2019s comments that Donald Trump\u2019s election could legitimize \u201ctrickle-down\u201d racism in America make us think twice about these questions. The history of slavery and racial segregation in America makes clear the important role  education and culture can play in fostering racism, and what happens when it becomes codified in law. And popular acceptance of the government\u2019s internment of Japanese-Americans as \u201cenemy aliens\u201d during World War II reminds us how quickly feelings toward an ethnic or racial group can change, especially at times of national emergency. Trump\u2019s intolerance reminds us of something else: the power of a charismatic leader to exploit such sentiments for political gain. The danger Trump poses lies with the kind of bond he has with his followers. It\u2019s an attachment based on submission to his authority, not to a party or principle. That\u2019s why he emphasizes the emotional content of his events \u2013 feeling the love, or fending off \u201cthe haters\u201d\u2013 and grooms his fans\u2019 loyalty through an oath to his person. Charismatic leaders have enormous influence over their followers, who look to them to set the tone for how they should think and behave. This becomes very dangerous when such leaders denigrate certain people, and then do nothing when their followers act on their words. Not only do they educate people to hate others, but they harness society\u2019s existing prejudices to rally supporters. Trump has proceeded in textbook fashion. Early on, he identified suspect ethnic and racial groups (Muslims, Hispanics), declared others fair game (women, journalists, the disabled), and then shrugged when the aggression began. Trump has used Twitter effectively to diffuse his racist messages throughout American society. On the heels of his racist tweets and retweets, Twitter has become a space where Trump\u2019s followers administer virtual public beatings to those who oppose their leader. Donald Trump: Mitt Romney 'let us down' Trump\u2019s refusal to rein them in lets racists feel emboldened and even protected. Insults become the order of the day, in the street, on airplanes and the subway, and on social media, following a chain that originates with Trump\u2019s provocations. His silence is especially notable given that the attacks have now extended to a group Trump professes to support: American Jews. Trump often cites his Jewish son-in-law and his daughter Ivanka\u2019s conversion to Judaism as evidence of his sympathies toward this religious minority. The fact is that Trump\u2019s incitement of racism has caused an outbreak of anti-Semitism in America. It\u2019s most visible in the social media attacks by Trump\u2019s followers on individuals of presumed Jewish name or heritage who criticize Trump in the media. I am among those who have been subjected to an onslaught of racist slurs, from caricatures of me as an evil Jewess to veiled threats of rape to invitations to buy a one-way ticket to Israel. It was a surreal moment to be at an academic conference on the use of images by Fascist regimes the other day and discover that my Twitter feed had been invaded by images that reproduce or mimic National Socialist propaganda. Are Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump the same person? The most disturbing image was the simplest one: a puff of smoke in the sky. Me, incinerated, as were millions of Jews during World War II. Since the start of his campaign, Trump has been testing the limits of what the American public and political class will accept as presidential behavior. He\u2019s been very direct about his intentions and targets, as charismatic authoritarians always are. It\u2019s unfortunate that the GOP leadership has not wanted to listen. Romney is right to warn his party what may be store for all of us if Trump is elected. Join us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion.Read CNNOpinion\u2019s new Flipboard magazine.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Muddassar Ahmed is a former adviser to the U.K. government on Muslim communities and a Patron of the Faiths Forum for London. The views expressed are his own. Sadiq Khan set to become London's first Muslim mayor Muddassar Ahmed: Britain has demonstrated that resorting to anti-Muslim language can backfire Sadiq Khan made British political history Friday, becoming the first Muslim to be elected mayor of London. But while his achievement is uplifting, the campaign by his opponents was a dispiriting, sometimes ugly affair. Khan \u2013 the Labour Party candidate who will succeed Boris Johnson as mayor \u2013 faced a divisive campaign from his main opponent, Zac Goldsmith. The Conservative Party candidate\u2019s campaign suggested Khan was a dangerous radical, exploiting racial and cultural stereotypes about Muslims through a dog whistle campaign rooted in subtle racism. Indeed, Goldsmith\u2019s recent op-ed in the popular Mail on Sunday newspaper attacking Khan was even, quite inexplicably, accompanied by an image of the 2005 London bombings. But it is telling that this campaign backfired. Why? Because it shows that the type of aggressive, populist campaign that has so far been successful for Donald Trump in the United States will not necessarily be a blueprint for success elsewhere. Although many on the right in Britain apparently believed that capitalizing on anti-Muslim sentiment is not just acceptable, but a sure ticket to victory, the strategy was found wanting. In short, there is a limit to the ability of bigotry to capture elections. And it is not just Britain that has demonstrated that resorting to anti-Muslim language can backfire. Take the example of former Canadian Prime Minister Stephen Harper. Last year, he resorted to crude anti-Muslim language as he sought re-election. In contrast, Harper\u2019s opponent, Justin Trudeau, went out of his way to embrace Muslims (and other minorities). Harper didn\u2019t just lose \u2013 he was trounced. Why? Many non-Muslim Canadians were repelled by seeing this faith-based bigotry in their secular politics. Just as importantly, the Muslim-bashing had another effect that Harper apparently did not seem to see coming \u2013 it prompted Canadian Muslims to vote in record numbers. You can bet that these new voters will continue and extend their political involvement, meaning that in a well deserved bit of irony, Harper\u2019s Islamophobic campaign may have created a Canadian Muslim political consciousness where none existed before. With this in mind, it is likely for good reason that in the United Kingdom, the Conservative group leader of the Greater London assembly, Andrew Boff, criticized Goldsmith\u2019s divisive campaign for damaging his party\u2019s relations with the Muslim community, something that could further hurt it down the road. In fact, the same thing could happen in America. After all, not only is Donald Trump now a widely detested politician (polls suggest that more Americans disapprove of him than are worried about Muslims), but American Muslims are becoming more politically engaged. And although the American Muslim population is relatively small, it may hold the key to swing states like Virginia, Florida and Ohio. Meanwhile, as Trump has chased Muslims away, Hillary Clinton and especially Bernie Sanders, her Democratic rival, have reached out. Sanders has struggled with attracting minority voters generally, but Muslim voters it seems have rewarded his attention, giving him an edge in Michigan and then Wisconsin. No matter which Democrat wins, the Democratic Party wins. Republicans, by contrast, risk alienating almost every minority \u2013 as well as female voters \u2013 with a selection of Trump as their presidential nominee. But that race will be decided in November. For now, it is worth remembering the powerful message that Sadiq Khan\u2019s London victory sends not just to anti-Muslim bigots, but also to Muslims themselves. Secular politics work: Faith-based prejudice might be real, but it is ultimately a losing proposition. And we can think of no better way to encourage and increase the embrace by British Muslims of their country and their democracy than this simple message: You will be judged by what you do, and not who you are. The sad truth is that the very people who demand Muslims prove their fidelity to secular values have not yet themselves begun to implement these values themselves, and that includes those in the Republican Party trying to exploit tensions. Despite Trump\u2019s success so far, we will have to wait until November to see how much success \u2013 or damage \u2013 his campaign has done to the Republican Party. But in the meantime, let\u2019s hope that Americans will deliver a similar message to the one Londoners just did \u2013 that ultimately, bigotry will not succeed. Join us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion.

He was a 2014 Harvard University Nieman fellow. Follow him on Twitter: @ijbailey. The views expressed are his own. Issac Bailey: For years, the GOP has made it clear it was so angry it would do anything to oppose Obama So much so, he says, it's now allied with an open bigot, something minority voters hear loud and clear Bailey: Driving away demographics GOP needs is delusional; it has itself to blame Five years ago this week, we should have seen this coming: A Republican Party so blinded by anger it would do anything to oppose President Barack Obama, including embracing an open bigot during the 21st century in America. That was the week SEAL Team 6 killed Osama bin Laden.  Hundreds of people spontaneously gathered outside the White House for an impromptu pep rally to celebrate that justice had been brought to the man who took down the Twin Towers, the man who had eluded capture for a decade. It was an achievement made possible by the decision former Secretary of Defense Robert Gates said was one of the most courageous he had ever seen a President make. This was the moment Americans of all backgrounds had longed for. And yet, because it was Obama, not President George W. Bush, most Republicans golf clapped while the rest of the nation break-danced on bin Laden\u2019s grave. A Public Policy Polling survey of Ohio during the height of the 2012 presidential election found that only 38% of Republicans were willing to give Obama any credit \u2013 while 15% credited Mitt Romney, who had never been President. In contrast, when the towers fell, Bush\u2019s approval rating shot up to a record 90%  as everyone, including Democrats, rallied around the man whose administration had not been able to prevent that disaster.  Sometime between September 12, 2001, and the beginning of the Obama era, winning eventually became more important to the GOP than even unity against a foreign enemy. Trump talks judgment, then cites National Enquirer Now, even the party\u2019s stated principles of small government, faith and other \u201ctraditional\u201d values have taken a backseat to Trump, a man whose faith, principles and conservatism are suspect, at best. But that\u2019s not why he\u2019s an existential threat to the GOP. It is because of what his presence at the top of the ticket screams to minority voters. There likely will be discussion on shows like \u201cMorning Joe\u201d and in David Brooks columns in The New York Times about how Trump defied political gravity, but that\u2019s not what minority voters will be pondering. They will be remembering that he kicked off his campaign talking about Mexican rapists and murderers. They\u2019ll be remembering that he wants a redo of \u201cOperation Wetback\u201d and that he talked openly about slaughtering Muslims with bullets smeared in pig\u2019s blood. They would not have forgotten that he was the most high-profile birther, disrespecting Obama in a way not even Joe \u201cYou Lie\u201d Wilson could. Bill O\u2019Reilly and other conservative talk show hosts will now swear up and down that Trump is no bigot and excuse and explain away all the awful that he\u2019s said and done, while other Republicans who fall in line will pretend they\u2019ve never heard Trump say anything untoward. But minority voters will know that it is neither coincidence nor happenstance that the man who captured the GOP nomination for President is the preferred candidate of the KKK and white nationalists \u2013 in 2016, not 1916. There is no amount of spin to undo that reality. The only question remains is how many Republicans will go along with Trump anyway. The truth is that the general election polling that shows Hillary Clinton ahead of Trump by double digits likely underestimates her position. Demographic shifts in this country would have given any Democratic nominee a strong advantage in the race to 270 Electoral College votes. And while Obama isn\u2019t on the ticket to energize minority voters like he did in 2008 and 2012, Trump will be. The only thing that can derail the great debate of 2017 \u2013 should we call Bill Clinton First Fella or First Dude? \u2013 is a large contingent of Bernie Sanders supporters either defecting away from Clinton or staying home. In other words, Republicans can\u2019t dictate the outcome of November\u2019s election. What Republicans will be doing this fall, whether they know it or not, is deciding if their party wants to write off the minority vote for at least another generation, if not forever. Those who get caught up in the silly debate of \u201cam I a racist if I support Donald Trump\u201d will be missing the point. Throughout our history, good people, nonracists, have helped pave the way for bigots, either by ignoring their ugliness, doing too little to oppose them, or even supporting them for reasons that have little or nothing to do with race. Chris Christie is not a racist. In fact, in 2012 he had millions of minority voters intrigued because he showed Obama respect during Superstorm Sandy, which, in a sane world, would have simply been expected, given that he was a governor desperately trying to receive federal help for the hurting residents of New Jersey. Trump: History in the making He was criticized by Republicans for doing so. That\u2019s how far the GOP had allowed its relationships with minorities to deteriorate, not even realizing \u2013 or caring \u2013 that their open disgust for the nation\u2019s first black President was a proxy for how minority voters believed the party viewed them as well. Now look at where we are. Christie, the man who four years ago earned the gratitude of millions of minority Americans by simply doing his job, is now one of the highest-profile surrogates for an open bigot who happens to also be the presumptive GOP nominee. Throughout the Obama era, conservative pundits and top Republican officials missed the role race continued to play in this country, whether it was the racial angst within their ranks that could be easily cultivated by a willing demagogue, or the determination of minorities to not allow racial progress to be rolled back without a massive fight. If they do that for another six months, it won\u2019t be Trump who would have destroyed the party of Lincoln. They would only have themselves to blame.

Tanwi Nandini Islam is the author of \u201cBright Lines,\u201d which was shortlisted for the Center for Fiction First Novel Prize and a finalist for the Edmund White Award for Debut Fiction. She is a writer, multimedia artist and founder of Hi Wildflower Botanica, a perfume and skincare line. The opinions expressed in this commentary are hers. Author: Brooklyn divided into rich vs. poor, old vs. young, supporters of Clinton vs. Sanders, between the Brooklyn that's celebrated and the Brooklyn that is ignored. Gentrification is raising rents, forcing those with less means to leave and changing neighborhoods, she says When driving through Brooklyn\u2019s Greenpoint neighborhood last week on the day of a Bernie Sanders event, I noticed that a giant mural saying, \u201cWelcome Home, Bernie!\u201d had sprung up on Franklin Street. It\u2019s no wonder why, for this neighborhood represents one of his core demographics: the young, white, urban creative professional. But the backdrop of Sanders\u2019 rooftop speech that afternoon was a cluster of luxury apartments with a view of the East River, highlighting one of New York\u2019s central issues: gentrification and the lack of affordable housing. Election season is a time of collective conversation, exposing the deep-seated political divisions among our friends, neighbors and family members. As the New York Democratic Primary approaches, the debate between Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton at the Brooklyn Navy Yard on Thursday evening is a showdown to claim a city that personifies not only diversity but also staggering disparity among its residents. What 'Hamilton' teaches us about standing up for your beliefs Brooklyn is a borough that\u2019s divided, but not only between rich vs. poor, old vs. young, liberal vs. progressive, supporters of Clinton vs. Sanders. It\u2019s divided between the Brooklyn that is celebrated and the Brooklyn that is neglected and ignored. While there is a palpable excitement in the neighborhood, I can\u2019t help but remember the last time I felt excited by a candidate. This will be my third presidential election in Brooklyn, and the tenor of this election is markedly different from the past two. On the night President Barack Obama won the 2008 election, a profound jubilation spilled onto the streets; the Republican reign was over. Bernie and Hillary, stop the nastiness I hopped on my bike, ringing its bell through my block in Bed Stuy, riding into Clinton Hill. I stopped to watch the celebration at a restaurant on DeKalb Avenue, where people toasted each other on this historic win. Black, white, Latino, Asian, young, old \u2013 all manner of people celebrated that night. I remember that feeling of elation thick in the air; a high that would last until his inauguration. Sanders, Reagan and the Spirit of '76 At the time, I was a grad student and worked as a high school teaching artist in different neighborhoods throughout the city. These were often at the very end of the subway line: Canarsie, Kingsbridge, Jamaica. My students reflected the beautiful multitude of communities in New York City\u2019s outer boroughs. Together, we tapped into their creativity and ability to tell stories based on their lives. Much of what we explored were the issues they faced growing up in a neighborhood often defined by a lack of access: to education, health care, housing, healthy food, clean air. My students possessed that adolescent verve and courage, always questioning the status quo. This taught me deeply about what true participation in social change looks like. For so many of my friends \u2013 artists, activists, community organizers and small business owners \u2013 the world they inhabit day in and day out is their neighborhood. It\u2019s where they work, create their art, organize for social justice. However, with landlords raising rents and luring wealthier tenants, several of my friends have been forced to move, either to the Bronx or Queens, or to another state entirely, where they can actually afford to live. 2016's big surprise: The power of small money in politics As a woman of color, writer and small-business owner in her early 30s, my race, class and gender certainly inform my vote. My vote is laced with my experiences living in the United States and my desire to be a part of political change. But the extreme changes we\u2019ve seen in Brooklyn in the past 10 years have affected its historically rich, vibrant culture. So, when I learned that the Democratic debate would take place in the Brooklyn Navy Yard, it felt like a telling example of how the trendy brand of Brooklyn \u2013 namesake of countless artisanal ventures \u2013 has not been a solution for poverty, deteriorating infrastructure, racial profiling and police brutality. These are realities of Brooklyn that exist outside of the bubble of the Brooklyn Navy Yard, a revitalized neighborhood that\u2019s the site of innovation and entrepreneurship. Bernie and Hillary: The toughest call \u201cIt is critical that we seize the moment and focus our country\u2019s attention on the pockets of Brooklyn where the popularity of our brand has yet to translate into prosperity for its residents,\u201d said Brooklyn Borough President Eric Adams in a statement released on Tuesday. His call to bring the debate to Brownsville, a predominantly black neighborhood in Brooklyn, emphasizes the needs of New Yorkers omitted from conversations about social and economic change. For example, both campaigns have sorely stumbled in response to the critically important actions of the Black Lives Matter movement. At the end of any two-term presidency, there\u2019s a combination of hope and frustration among voters. As part of the generation that voted Obama into office, we\u2019ve accepted his successes and his limitations as president. Just as we\u2019ve lived to see the legalization of same-sex marriage, we\u2019ve also seen the frightening spate of mass shootings and the prolific use of drones in warfare. It\u2019s easy to see Hillary Clinton as an extension of these policies as secretary of state and Bernie Sanders as an outsider. Yet it can be argued that as a woman, Hillary Clinton is a consummate outsider in politics, a man\u2019s game. I\u2019ve rehashed this internal debate countless times. Thursday\u2019s debate will illuminate which candidate represents the Brooklyn in which we want to live. Join us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion.Read CNNOpinion\u2019s Flipboard magazine.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Julius Getman is a labor law scholar, an emeritus professor at the University of Texas at Austin, and author of the forthcoming book, \u201cThe Supreme Court on Unions: Why Labor Law is Failing American Workers.\u201d The views expressed are his own. The Supreme Court said Tuesday it was evenly divided in a case concerning public sector unions Julius Getman: Anti-union bias of the Supreme Court is not set in stone The anger of working-class whites is generally seen as having fueled the rise of Donald Trump\u2019s presidential candidacy. But what has been largely overlooked is the relationship between white working-class anger, racial animosity, and the demise of unions. When unions were powerful, collective bargaining produced high wages, regular wage increases, and decent working conditions for millions of workers. Union members were an important element of society, and their political education programs were able to act as a barrier to demagogues spouting divisive populist rhetoric. For instance, unions helped to reduce the appeal of former Alabama governor and presidential candidate George Wallace and his pro-segregationist, anti-establishment messages in 1968, by pointing out the sorry plight of workers in Alabama. And the achievements of collective bargaining also indirectly benefited non-union employees because their employers were motivated to set wages at nearly comparable rates to avoid unionization. True, unionization was not a total panacea for racial animosity. But it gave white and black workers a common stake in the collective bargaining process. In addition, workers who walk a picket line together for any length of time almost invariably come to see each other as brothers and sisters rather than as rivals for employer benefits. Yet the demise of collective bargaining has meant decades of stagnant wages and take-it-or-leave-it employment conditions for workers, who have come to believe they are invisible to those with political or economic power. And as Ralph Ellison pointed out many years ago, feeling invisible inevitably leads to anger. So, what happened? Many factors have played a role in the demise of unions, but the anti-union holdings of the Supreme Court have been among the most significant. The current court\u2019s harmful decisions have been issued despite the fact that since passage of the National Labor Relations Act (NLRA) in 1935, the official policy of the United States has favored \u201cencouraging the practice and procedure of collective bargaining.\u201d As the framers of the act realized, for collective bargaining to flourish,  workers must be able to exercise three basic rights: the right to join unions, to bargain collectively, and to strike.  Each of these basic rights of workers has been significantly undercut by Supreme Court decisions. The right to organize, for example, has been rendered ineffective by subordinating it to employer property rights. Because of Supreme Court decisions, employers faced with an organizing effort are able to require workers to attend captive audience meetings in which company speakers demean the value and extol the dangers to workers of voting union in National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) representation elections. Unions are not entitled to enter company premises \u2013 even the parking lot \u2013 to respond. The result is a massive advantage for employers in NLRB representation elections. That advantage helps to explain why \u2013 although studies have shown that most employees would like to be unionized \u2013 less than 10% are. The law states that an employer must bargain in good faith with a union selected by its employees. But employers often come to the bargaining table with the goal of not reaching an agreement. If they are successful in this effort, the union is likely to fade away. Bargaining with the goal of forestalling agreement is unlawful, but the Supreme Court has rejected the remedy of requiring employers to accept reasonable customary contract provisions. As a result, what is called \u201csurface bargaining\u201d is quite common and a large number of unions that win NLRB representation elections do not achieve acceptable contracts. The only available means for unions to force agreement from an unwilling employer is the strike. The right to strike is essential to collective bargaining, but the right to strike has also been substantially undercut by the high court. Soon after the NLRA was enacted, the court declared that employers could respond to a strike by hiring permanent replacements to take the jobs of strikers. As a result, in the vast majority of collective bargaining strikes, the union\u2019s striking members are risking their jobs. The Supreme Court has regularly reaffirmed this conclusion without examining either the need for it or how it can be reconciled with the oft-stated policy of insulating workers\u2019 job rights from union activity. And the current court has undercut the ability of unions to collect dues from the employees whose interests they are required to advance. But the anti-union bias of the Supreme Court is not set in stone. At least four members of the court recognize that unions and collective bargaining have made a positive contribution to the economic well-being and the social cohesiveness of workers. As a result of the death of Justice Antonin Scalia, the court is currently evenly divided on the role of unions, which gives temporary power to the Courts of Appeals in labor cases. How? Before cases are heard by the Supreme Court, they are almost always passed on by one of the Courts of Appeals. If the Supreme Court splits four to four, the opinion of the Court of Appeals governs. Thus, the decision by the Ninth Circuit upholding the right of public employee unions to assess a \u201cfair share\u201d of union dues to non-members, on whose behalf the union bargains, was upheld this week by an equally divided court. This result was a major victory for unions, whose leaders feared, with good reason, that the court led by Justices Scalia and Alito was about to overrule prior precedent, and hold that such \u201cfair share\u201d arrangements violated the First Amendment. (Organized labor was fortunate that the decision being reviewed came from the relatively liberal Ninth Circuit. Had the issue been passed on by the Fifth Circuit, an opposite result would have likely been before the high court and affirmed by the same four to four vote). Of course, the current uneasy arrangement cannot survive for long. The make-up of the Supreme Court will inevitably change, and the next president is likely to be in a position to appoint justices who will determine whether the court changes course to support collective bargaining and basic worker rights, or whether it continues to deny workers the rights once granted them by statute. This week\u2019s decision was another reminder that for labor, as for many other Americans, the stakes for the 2016 presidential election are huge.

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Julian Zelizer is a professor of history and public affairs at Princeton University and a New America fellow. He is the author of \u201cJimmy Carter\u201d and \u201cThe Fierce Urgency of Now: Lyndon Johnson, Congress, and the Battle for the Great Society.\u201d The opinions expressed in this commentary are his. Sanders is keeping it competitive, but even if he loses, he will have a powerful effect in November, writes Julian Zelizer He says Sanders has forced Clinton to adopt stances that will appeal more broadly to the Democratic base Bernie Sanders\u2019 campaign gained new momentum with three commanding victories this weekend in Washington, Hawaii and Alaska. While Hillary Clinton maintains a comfortable lead in the delegate count, it looks as though it\u2019s going to be a long time before she can close this race. Sanders continues to excite, to inspire and, most importantly, to win. A key test will be the April 19 primary in New York, a state with a large population of minority voters, a group that has favored Clinton in other big contests. Sanders: Clooney fundraiser is 'obscene' The success of Sanders has been a huge surprise and disappointment to Clinton and her supporters. The once inevitable nominee has been forced to run in an extremely competitive primary against a challenger who has exposed many of her flaws and weaknesses. Still, in the long run, Sanders may turn out to have been one of the best things to have happened to Clinton\u2019s campaign. How Bernie Sanders has already won Assuming that she does win the nomination, Clinton will emerge as a much stronger candidate and her campaign operation will be in a better position for the fall, thanks to Sanders\u2019 insurgency. Unlike divisive primaries that hurt a political party \u2013 such as Sen. Ted Kennedy\u2019s challenge to President Jimmy Carter in 1980 or, most likely, the internecine battle that is ravaging the GOP this year \u2013 the Democrats will benefit as a result of the past few months. How has Sanders helped? How could it be that the constant attacks on Clinton\u2019s  domestic record, her connections to Wall Street and her judgment as a leader leave her in better shape than when she started? How can the sweeping wins in the West be anything but bad for the front-runner? Thanks to Sanders, economic issues are now front and center in this campaign. While Sanders may be a single-issue candidate focused on inequality, it\u2019s a really big issue that he has dealt with. And it\u2019s one which, as the campaign in both parties has revealed, really resonates at this moment in history. Americans are tired of, and scared by, the growing economic divisions in our society as well as the insecurity that faces middle-class families. In response to Sanders, Clinton has taken a stronger stand on these economic issues and worked harder to demonstrate her commitment to addressing these challenges if she should be elected president. Sanders has created room for Clinton, who has been a centrist Democrat, to be more unabashedly liberal in response to this problem, and this will help her. Exonerated death row inmate: Clinton wrong on death penalty Economic security is an issue that Democrats have historically done well with. This issue was at the heart of the New Deal, the formative period for the modern party. Clinton has also responded to Sanders by clarifying other kinds of issues that will be central to her presidency. In her effort to distinguish herself from the senator, she has spoken much more about other issue areas that she would address, including the central questions  of racial and gender inequality. Even if the government addressed economic inequality, she said, \u201cwe would still have racism holding people back. We would still have sexism preventing women from getting equal pay. We would still have LGBT people who get married on Saturday and fired on Monday.\u201d She has slowly crafted a set of arguments around a potential presidency that would address the multiple sources of division within this country. Doing so offers a path toward building a broad and diverse political coalition. While Sanders offers a much more coherent political vision, Clinton has slowly developed an argument about her belief in pragmatic liberalism, which will hold considerable appeal to voters who are seeking real gains in the coming four years. With Sanders offering bold ideas like single-payer health insurance, Clinton has positioned herself as a liberal Democrat who understands that she will have to operate in a very conservative political world. This has pushed her to champion an argument about the ways that she would solidify and expand the gains that have been made under President Obama and move into new policy areas with specified and realistic measures. For many constituencies that are desperate to keep the programs that Obama achieved and hoping for more assistance, this argument can resonate. Clinton is winning but Sanders is no loser For instance, Clinton proposes strengthening Obamacare with measures like a $5,000 per family tax credit to reduce the amount that Americans have to pay for premiums and out-of-pocket charges. She also would like to ensure that Americans could have three sick visits every year to their doctors without having to meet a deductible. She would also continue Obama\u2019s policy of providing federal money to match the spending of states which expand Medicaid, while investing in outreach programs to help individuals enroll. One of Sanders\u2019 biggest decisions was to keep the debate focused on policy rather than personality and character. Although some of his supporters have been frustrated that he has not gone after issues like the Clinton email scandal, the net result was to elevate the quality of the discourse within the Democratic Party. With the GOP embroiled in a low-level discussion that has even degenerated into comparing  the photographs of spouses and the size of a candidate\u2019s hands, the Democrats have appeared as the adults in the room (even if not as much fun to watch) with a series of debates over policy. Democrats debate whether the regulatory approach of the Affordable Care Act or a single-payer health care system is more effective, at the same time that Donald Trump and his rivals engage in debates that are as far from presidential as they can be. The ability of the Sanders campaign to mobilize Americans who have been alienated from politics can have very positive ramifications in the fall. He has inspired the progressive coalition of the Democratic Party \u2013 which is a powerful, mobilized and motivated group  that Democratic candidates have too often ignored in recent decades. If Clinton can find a way to sustain the support of the movement that Sanders has built, and if Sanders is willing to join forces with Clinton in the fall, this can be an extraordinarily effective electoral tool, particularly in swing states like Ohio and Florida. In 2008, Obama showed just how powerful new voices could be in determining the outcome of an election. If Clinton and Sanders can prevent voters, like younger Americans, from leaving the system once again, they could become part of a winning coalition in November. The real cause of Trump isn't Obama This won\u2019t be easy. Clinton will have to work hard, reaching out to Sanders supporters and working with the senator himself to avoid squandering this opportunity. Through her vice presidential selection and word of potential cabinet picks, as well as concessions in the party platform, she will have to convince his followers that her appeals to his issues are more than campaign rhetoric. Finally the Sanders campaign was an early wake-up call for the Clinton team which, as in 2008, was running an incredibly sloppy and unstructured operation that was counting on Clinton\u2019s experience and intellectual skill to be enough to win the race. The week in politics As it became clear that Sanders posed a very serious threat, the Clinton team has done a much better job in terms of its organization, its media work and its messaging. When this race ends, the Clinton campaign will be in much better place to take on Donald Trump or any other Republican in what is likely to  be an extraordinarily nasty race. If Hillary makes it all the way to the White House in 2017, she can look back with appreciation to the role that Bernie played.

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Sally Kohn is an activist, columnist and television commentator. Follow her on Twitter: @sallykohn. The opinions expressed in this commentary are hers. Kohn: Hillary Clinton won several major contests Tuesday night,  powering her quest for the party nomination She says the Democratic Party is stronger thanks to passion driving Bernie Sanders' campaign It\u2019s time to wake up. And stand up. And do something. All hands on deck. This is not a drill. The future of our union is at stake. Sanders, the argument went, was the only candidate who could better appeal to white, working-class Democrats who felt shafted by NAFTA and other trade deals. Clinton, whether because she has actually moved toward more populist economic policies or simply has done a better job at dressing up her centrist pragmatism \u2013 appears to have burst Sanders\u2019 bubble. Bernie Sanders defiant despite primary losses Hillary Clinton can now only be said to be a \u201cregional candidate\u201d insofar as the entirety of the United States constitutes a region. At this stage, it now looks like Bernie Sanders has a very narrow path \u2013 if one exists at all \u2013 to winning the delegates necessary to be the Democratic nominee.  And so three essential points now bear making. First, Hillary Clinton may be winning the Democratic nomination, but that doesn\u2019t mean Bernie Sanders has lost.  Without a doubt, his candidacy has changed this campaign for the better. Exonerated death row inmate: Clinton wrong on death penalty During the last CNN Democratic debate, held in Flint, Michigan, Clinton and Sanders spoke about issues of racial bias and structural racism for almost an hour, maybe more. To my recollection, that\u2019s unheard of from presidential candidates in a party that has largely taken the African American vote for granted.  And then, after that, they debated trade policy for 20 minutes or so, with Sanders pushing Clinton to account for her past support of disastrous deals such as NAFTA. I like to think that Hillary Clinton would have come out against the TPP trade deal either way, but whether on that or so many other points, Sanders clearly forced Clinton to explain to the American people how she would break from the triangulating centrism her last name and her own Wall Street-cozy record have come to represent. At Democratic town hall, candidates take on Donald Trump We still don\u2019t know what Clinton said in her paid speeches to big banks, but thanks to Bernie Sanders, we can be darn sure Clinton will think twice about whatever she says to and about Wall Street going forward. Second, the Democratic Party \u2013 and democracy in general \u2013 is far stronger thanks to the incredible grassroots groundswell of engagement and passion that has driven Bernie Sanders\u2019 campaign. I have said as much before: Barack Obama\u2019s 2008 race was a campaign masquerading as a movement; Bernie Sanders\u2019 race was truly a movement masquerading as a campaign. The real agenda was never to elect a candidate.  It was, as Sanders himself has said so many times, to seed a revolution. Reckless driving: The Hillary, Bernie blowup over autos And whether through millions of small-dollar donations that added up to rival the biggest checks from the biggest donors to the biggest super PACS, or in doggedly making economic inequality and the broken political system core issues of the Democratic platform, the Bernie Sanders movement has and will continue to force a Democratic Party long cowed by centrist blue dogs to return to the populist beating heart of the party\u2019s progressive wing. It\u2019s no surprise that young voters in particular treat the likes of Sanders and Elizabeth Warren like rock stars.  This is the future of the Democratic Party, and incidentally, reflects a populist agenda that resonates across party lines, too.  And we can anticipate, if Sanders indeed stays in the race through the convention as he has promised, the progressive wing will continue to raise its voice and concerns \u2013 and flex its muscle especially around Clinton\u2019s vice presidential choice. And third, despite the fact that prominent Democrats argued the best thing for the party was for Hillary to run unopposed in the primary or else defeat Sanders quickly, it\u2019s clear that Sanders has made Clinton a better candidate. He has tested out lines of attack for which she needed practice. He pushed her to support policies and reasoning that will help her win over the Democratic left.  And he forced her to actively and authentically reach out to voters of color, who will need to turn out with strength and loyalty to defeat Donald Trump in November. Sanders hits Clinton over trade As Tuesday\u2019s election results rolled in, some seemed to still be trivializing the very point of the primary.  After noting that Clinton had won Florida, Ohio and North Carolina, Democratic pollster Anna Greenberg tweeted, \u201cCan we put a stop to all of this?\u201d But all this is democracy.  A democracy through which progressive Democrats finally articulated their frustration with party orthodoxy that always seems to prefer pragmatism over principle and that takes voters of color and women voters for granted all too often. A democracy in which real substantive positions and differences were debated and voters were engaged.  A democracy not based on calling names but articulating a vision.  A democracy of, by and for the people \u2013 the voters \u2013 not the big banks and big donors. Can we put a stop to all of that? I hope not. Join us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion.

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Sally Kohn is an activist, columnist and television commentator. Follow her on Twitter: @sallykohn. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. Sally Kohn: That many fellow Americans have been willing to vote in primaries for Trump, a protofascist hatemonger, is depressing Fellow citizens, she says: Wake up! History shows that waiting as hate takes hold in a country can have disastrous results She says Americans must stand against the forces of hate in this election and not stand by silently Since Super Tuesday, I\u2019ve been depressed.  Admittedly, it was a long time coming.  But somehow the realization that a significant percentage of my fellow Americans have been willing to cast a ballot for a protofascist hatemonger somehow finally sunk in. This becomes especially worrisome if you factor in the votes for the overtly bigoted Donald Trump and the slightly more subtle but potentially far more dangerous, hate-fueled Ted Cruz. Then the math starts to look a little too much like the early moments of Adolf Hitler\u2019s rise in Germany. Don\u2019t forget: Hitler first rose to national prominence in Germany not by seizing power but by running for president.  He lost, but 36.8% of Germans voted for him. Now, the likes of comedian Louis C.K. and Glenn Beck have compared Trump to Hitler.  And the critique is gaining so much traction that Trump himself is now feeling put on the defensive.  Asked about how having supporters at his rallies raise their hands and pledge to vote for Trump is leading to photos eerily recalling Nazi salutes, Trump was dismissive. \u201cI don\u2019t want to offend anyone,\u201d he said Tuesday morning, adding it\u2019s just something he and his followers do \u201cfor fun.\u201d There are certainly plenty of contrasts with post-WWI Germany.  Primarily, despite what many conservative voters might think, the United States economy is recovering, and we\u2019re enjoying our 71st consecutive month of private sector job growth. But there is undeniably a deep anger spreading, mainly among older white voters, and being harnessed \u2013 even touched off \u2013 by Trump.  What\u2019s troubling is where it could lead. Will U.S. democracy commit suicide? Are enough Americans willing to vote for a presidential candidate who smears Mexicans and denigrates Muslims all while talking about punching protesters in the face and playing footsie with the KKK?  Yes, yes they might be. As a Jewish American whose family came from Germany and Russia, I don\u2019t make this analogy lightly. I know very well what I\u2019m suggesting, just as Trump surely knows that he is deliberately stoking the hate-tinged anger of a swath of white voters whose desperation and resentment only seems to grow as their numbers shrink.  These are dark times indeed. So I confessed all this to a friend as the sun started setting the day after Super Tuesday and my dark sense of foreboding was setting in. And she texted back to me: \u201cThere is always light \u2013 there is never darkness \u2013 did you know that?  There is always light there, it\u2019s just less light, but there is no such thing as no light, pure darkness.\u201d  Which is apparently scientifically true. Darkness, in the sense that we know it on Earth anyway, isn\u2019t the actual absence of light just the absence of visible or discernible light. \u201cNow that is a revelation of sorts,\u201d my friend added. Yes, yes it is. I had been depressed by the notion that in an era in which our country is still engaged in the struggle to achieve full economic and racial justice, a struggle punctuated by moments of progress \u2013 from the election of our nation\u2019s first black president to the achievement of marriage equality and more \u2013 so many Americans see the advancements of  others as a strike against themselves. I\u2019m not naive. I know that in a nation founded and wound through with white supremacy and misogyny, change doesn\u2019t come without resistance. The backlash we\u2019re seeing now \u2013 the one that brought us Trump \u2013 is the direct result of progress. It is the dark side on the other side of the daylight of social change. I should find hope in the backlash, that people feel the need to backlash against something.  But instead, I\u2019m scared. And sad. And then I was reminded of the light. The light isn\u2019t some vague sense of optimism in the long arc of history bending toward justice. The light is neither passive nor inevitable. Like all light, it requires energy.  Action. The light, in case you don\u2019t realize it yet, is my fellow Americans. You. I don\u2019t mean you in the abstract plural sense.  I mean YOU!  The individual, actual, you reading this.  You are our nation\u2019s salvation.  Our nation\u2019s hope. The time for worrying and fretting and rocking back and forth in the fetal position is over. This is not a drill, America. Donald Trump \u2013 or worse, Ted Cruz \u2013 could become president of our nation.  Although I am frightened about what they would do in office, I\u2019m even more frightened about what their supporters would do with a boundless sense of empowerment. There have been too many instances of Trump supporters using the n-word and jeering at black protesters, or beating up homeless people, or threatening Muslims. Is Trump the new Silvio Berlusconi? Imagine what they would do if they felt emboldened and enabled by the presidency? We\u2019ve seen enough hatred in this country against our current President not because of what he stands for but simply who he is.  Imagine how much worse things could get under a president who encourages such hatred or even just looks the other way. The co-conspirator of evil is silence.  We know from history that demagogues and genocidal regimes have taken root not necessarily because they had majority support but because the majority remained silent as the injustices built. In the past few days, too many decent Americans have told me they\u2019re not worried about the election because Donald Trump can\u2019t win.  Well let me tell you, anything can happen in an election.  But the surefire way for  Trump or Cruz to become president is for those of us who oppose them to assume they won\u2019t and, through our passivity let it happen. It\u2019s time to wake up, America.  It\u2019s time to scream from the rooftops.  It\u2019s time to shine a giant light on social change and progress and defend it with every fiber of our beings.  And I don\u2019t just mean complaining about Trump to your friends at parties or posting a hashtag on social media.  I mean using your mind, body and voice to stand in the way of injustice and stand up for fairness and equality. Former Mexican President: Trump reminds me of Hitler How do you do that? By refusing to stereotype Muslims and objecting when others do so around you.  By defending not what is derided as political correctness but doing what\u2019s correct \u2013 the simple idea of treating everyone respectfully. By being a witness to and even taking the risk to intervene in police harassment and brutality against minorities. By standing up for the idea that in America, we all do better when we all do better. Even if 63% of Germans didn\u2019t vote for Hitler that first time around, many went along willingly eventually.  And many no doubt wanted to object, to fight back, but by then it was too late. It\u2019s not too late to save America from the dark and cancerous hatred surging in the veins of these angry voters and their figureheads.  It is not too late to protect our principles and preserve the progress we\u2019ve made and keep fighting for more. History teaches us not to be complacent.  And my friend taught me that even in the very darkest of moments, light persists.  There can be no darkness without light.  There can be no America without the good people who preserve its ideals, no matter how imperfectly realized, who fight to keep making our country better instead of letting us descend into division and hate. It\u2019s time to wake up. And stand up. And do something. All hands on deck. This is not a drill. The future of our union is at stake. Join us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion.

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Todd Graham is director of debate at Southern Illinois University. His teams have won national championships for three years, and he\u2019s been recognized twice as the national debate coach of the year. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his. Debate coach Todd Graham grades Clinton and Sanders by their ability to seal deal with supporters and steal opponent's voters He says Clinton did better at this, dinging Sanders on auto bailout vote; Sanders, though, improved his pitch to African American voters When my debate team is being judged by a panel of critics in intercollegiate debate, the first thing we do, way before the debate begins, is analyze the panel of judges.  Based on the arguments we will present, we try to predict the judges who will vote for us, the ones who will vote against us, and who\u2019s on the fence.  My mantra for our teams before these debates:  Seal and steal. I\u2019m grading the Democratic candidates in Sunday\u2019s debate on those two criteria. Since both candidates are looking to strengthen their position in the polls, both debaters, Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders, should be focused on maintaining their base \u2013 that is, not losing voters who they think support them \u2013 while at the same time attempting to poach a few voters who are in their opponent\u2019s demographic. It was an excellent debate, with both candidates succeeding on the first criterion. But I\u2019m not sure they did well enough in the second.  Even though it\u2019s unlikely either stole very many votes, the quality of argument was high \u2013 and reversing a voter\u2019s mind is quite difficult, which is why both candidates received higher than average scores. Seal: Clinton\u2019s base includes African-American voters, many of whom are religious, and she was excellent in aiming her persuasion toward that demographic. It began with a subtle, but noticeable, first answer when she said \u201cAmen to that,\u201d as she indicated her agreement with a Sanders answer. Later, when asked whom she prays for, Clinton had a long answer, laying out much of her belief structure. Finally, she mentioned her work in both South Carolina and in Alabama to fight oppression in academics and the criminal justice system.  She even handled Don Lemon\u2019s \u201cSo tell me how you are a racist,\u201d question (I rephrased it from his query about racial \u201cblind spots\u201d  but I promise you that\u2019s what he asked!) pretty well, as did Sanders. (Lemon, surprisingly, asked them both to explain their racist tendencies). Steal: Two issues seem at the heart of Sanders\u2019 support from millennials. First is global warming, and I didn\u2019t think Clinton made any progress there. It was especially noticeable on the question of whether she supported fracking, when her long, complicated answer was diffused by Sanders when he said his answer was much more simple, \u201cNo, I do not support fracking.\u201d The idea of bailouts as a negative concept is also at the heart of the Sanders campaign.  Clinton had a new approach on this and it was quite successful in this debate.  She decided to take a specific example of the automobile industry, and played it against Sanders.  She voted to bail them out, she said, and argued that we\u2019d be short another four million jobs if everyone voted like Sanders: against the bailout. Indeed, she took one of Sanders best arguments from previous debates and turned it on him in this one. It might not steal a lot of votes, but I thought it was a terrific approach, particularly in Michigan, the longtime locus of the American auto industry. Also, equally as important, Clinton didn\u2019t offend any of the Sanders base in this debate and this is crucial in case she wins the Democratic nomination, since she\u2019ll need ever vote she can get. Seal:  He was stronger than Clinton on climate change with his fracking answer and his general tone. Sanders was excellent, as always, criticizing free trade agreements and Wall Street influence. His base won\u2019t doubt their decision based on any of his answers in the debate. Steal:  Sanders was solid on African American issues. He should play up his history more often. I liked that he mentioned his arrest by Chicago police when working to desegregate housing at the University of Chicago.  Add to that his marching on Washington with Martin Luther King Jr., and there\u2019s a chance that Sanders might win over some of Clinton\u2019s chief demographic.  Did he steal many?  Probably not.  But he certainly didn\u2019t lose any African American voters, in case he wins the Democratic nomination.  Again, that\u2019s crucial to a general election victory. Sanders needs to be careful in two areas: sarcasm and occasional tone. His \u201cisn\u2019t it tragic\u2026\u201d spiel needs to go, since sarcasm is often not welcome by a general audience. The one exception? I appreciated Sanders\u2019 response when Clinton said she\u2019d release her transcripts of Wall Street speeches when everyone else did.  Sanders, who\u2019s never given a speech to Wall Street, began by waving his arms wildly, as if shooing pigeons in the park, and yelled, \u201cI release it.\u201d This even got a chuckle out of Clinton. The other area Sanders needs to be careful: His tone with Clinton when he thinks she interrupts him is a bit harsh, even if he\u2019s correct. The audience could be heard gasping when he barked at her. Fixing this shouldn\u2019t be a problem. Join us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion.Read CNNOpinion\u2019s new Flipboard magazine.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Julian Zelizer is a professor of history and public affairs at Princeton University and a New America fellow. He is the author of \u201cJimmy Carter\u201d and \u201cThe Fierce Urgency of Now: Lyndon Johnson, Congress, and the Battle for the Great Society.\u201d The opinions expressed in this commentary are his. Julian Zelizer: It's not the first time that a Romney has powerfully attacked the GOP frontrunner for president Romney's father George opposed Barry Goldwater in 1964, and correctly predicted he would lose in a landslide Yet George Romney was seeking a broader, less conservative party while his son is looking for ideological purity, Zelizer says Former Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney launched a blistering attack on Donald Trump. In an effort to change the dynamic of this primary season, Romney offered blistering words, characterizing Trump as a \u201cfraud\u201d and a \u201cphony\u201d who needed to be stopped. He said that Trump was \u201cplaying the American public for suckers.\u201d \u201cHis promises are as worthless as a degree from Trump University,\u201d the 2012 candidate said. \u201cHe has neither the temperament or the judgment to be president.\u201d While he encouraged primary voters to vote for any of Trump\u2019s remaining challengers, there\u2019s a real question about whether an attack from Romney, as an embodiment of the GOP establishment, will help the Republican frontrunner more than it hurts him. This is not the first time a Romney has taken a powerful stab at the Republican frontrunner. In 1964, his father, Michigan Gov. George Romney, blasted his party\u2019s decision to nominate Arizona Sen. Barry Goldwater. Is Trump the new Silvio Berlusconi? George Romney predicted presciently that Goldwater\u2019s candidacy would be devastating to the GOP, a party where northern moderates still played a huge role in the electorate and the party leadership. One of George Romney\u2019s sharpest critiques of the Arizona senator revolved around his opposition to the Civil Rights Act of 1964, a position that Romney couldn\u2019t understand. \u201cA \u2018no\u2019 vote on civil rights certainly indicates,\u201d he said, \u201cthat Goldwater\u2019s views in this vital area are not in accord with the sentiment of the majority of the public, the majority of Republicans, the majority of Congress\u2026\u201d Governor Romney had strong support from his colleagues. A majority of Republican governors agreed with him. There were many supporters who wanted Romney to run, though the governor had promised that he would not do this in 1964 so that he could work on the problems of his state. Though he wasn\u2019t the nominee, Romney worked hard to make sure that the GOP included a strong civil rights plank in the party platform. He avoided endorsing Goldwater, to the dismay of conservatives. When one Goldwater supporter approached Romney to request his support, according to historian Rick Perlstein, he received \u201cnothing but a bitter stare.\u201d Donald Trump's dangerous KKK game George Romney\u2019s opposition didn\u2019t stop. Romney did almost nothing to support Goldwater\u2019s campaign. One Lyndon Johnson ad quoted Romney as saying that Goldwater\u2019s nomination would lead to the \u201csuicidal destruction of the Republican Party.\u201d The two men didn\u2019t appear together. Romney won his own re-election bid despite divorcing himself from the party\u2019s nominee, and the governor\u2019s victory was a landslide. The difference between the opposition of son and father says a lot about how the Republican Party has changed. When George Romney took on Barry Goldwater, his opposition was largely about principle, not personality. Even when thinking about his own re-election, he realized that Republicans needed candidates who could appeal beyond the right. The future of the party, in his mind, depended on a diverse coalition that brought together conservatives, moderates and progressives around the ideas of limited government, tough national security, and an embrace of racial equality. Trump's candidacy represents a battle for the soul of America The speech by his son was very different. The Republican Party has shifted far to the right since 1964. Even Barry Goldwater would probably be considered to be too tame by today\u2019s tea party standards. There are very few genuine moderates in the party anymore. Those who we consider moderate today were on the right wing just about a decade ago. Mitt Romney\u2019s speech says nothing about the kind of arguments that his father made. His main critique of Trump is that he is too liberal, that he is a Democrat hiding in Republican clothes. Making history: Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump blaze trails In fact, he ironically started by citing Ronald Reagan\u2019s speech in favor of Barry Goldwater during that campaign. Unlike 1964, this Romney is arguing that the party needs to make certain there is no move away from the Republican orthodoxy on issues like health care and taxation. Though Romney attacked particular parts of Trump\u2019s hawkish statements about ISIS, the fact is that both are part of a GOP that has embraced a muscular and highly aggressive militaristic approach to dealing with terrorist threats. Is Donald Trump another Barry Goldwater? His other major complaint simply had to do with style and approach. He doesn\u2019t like the kind of smashmouth politics that Trump embraces, which he thinks is unfitting for his party. The problem is that this style is not simply an invention of Trump. Since their emergence in 2008, tea party Republicans, with Sarah Palin, the vice presidential nominee, as practitioner have embraced this kind of confrontational, aggressive and provocative campaign style that Trump is taking to new levels. We have also seen this in the House of Representatives, where Freedom Caucus members have gone to great lengths to lower the bar for pursuing conservative goals. On race, Donald Trump knows exactly what he's doing Romney\u2019s criticism of Trump\u2019s statements about Muslims, immigrants, and race comes too late given the way in which hard-line elements on these issues have been taking a hold on the party for many years already. Party leaders have not done enough to push back against these kinds of statements and now it is coming back to bite them. While Romney did speak in strongly critical fashion about Trump\u2019s interview with CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper about the KKK, he and other Republican leaders have not devoted nearly enough energy to reprimanding and denouncing fringe elements of the Republican Party that have played to racial sentiment in their attacks on the first African-American president. Trump came from somewhere. Indeed, as Trump has reminded the press, Romney sought his support in 2012 despite the real estate mogul being the leading voice of the \u2018birther\u201d movement which attempted to de-legitimize President Barack Obama. Donald Trump on State of the Union: Full Interview For this reason, Romney\u2019s attack could easily play right into Trump\u2019s hands. His attack on style will be seen as an implicit critique of the anti-establishment politics that the Freedom Party embraces. To have Romney criticize Trump in this way is to fuel a narrative on the right of a party that is trying to stifle the only genuine voice that exists. Many Republicans will hear Romney, the symbol of the 1%, attacking Trump\u2019s criticism of free trade and double down on their support of this insurgent campaign. Mitt Romney\u2019s attacks on Donald Trump are nothing compared to what his father did. Many decades ago, his father took a stand for a party that would be ideologically diverse and where the center and right would both have a place at the table. His son, standing in the shadow of Ronald Reagan and Newt Gingrich, is calling for his party to be more ideologically pure and insisting on a civil style of politics that no longer has much of a hold on many Republicans.

He was a 2014 Harvard University Nieman fellow. Twitter: @ijbailey The views expressed are his own. Issac Bailey: Black students ejected from Trump rally; it fits pattern of selective bigotry Trump shows in campaign He says Trump supporters ignore behavior of their frightened-bully candidate as he repeatedly kicks minorities to curb Law enforcement removed a couple of dozen black students from a Donald Trump rally at Valdosta State University in Georgia on Monday. And while we don\u2019t know who ordered it or why they did it, it is becoming increasingly clear that the GOP front-runner\u2019s use of sometimes veiled, sometimes overt selective bigotry is the reason the incident has become more than just the latest \u201cprotesters get kicked out of campaign event\u201d story. This is what happens when you launch your presidential campaign on the backs of \u201cMexican rapists\u201d and when a couple of your supporters say they are taking cues from you when they beat a homeless Hispanic man.  A Secret Service agent choking a photojournalist on Monday at one of Trump\u2019s rallies is in line with the candidate\u2019s praise for dictators and fascists. It also fits right in with his calls to harm people in a variety of ways, including killing the family members of suspected terrorists and rewriting libel laws to shred America\u2019s constitutionally protected right to free speech . On race, Donald Trump knows exactly what he's doing You can\u2019t play footsie with David Duke and the Ku Klux Klan, and dance an \u201cI don\u2019t want to be associated with them\u201d but \u201cNo, I don\u2019t have enough information about them to denounce them\u201d two-step, and then get to run away from the consequences, no matter how often your numerous supporters defend you. It is true that people get thrown out of campaign rallies all the time, mostly because they are shouting down the candidate or being rowdy. But at Trump rallies, like one in North Carolina, a Muslim woman wearing a hijab and standing silently got kicked out, too. That makes sense, given that Trump wants to ban Muslims from entering the United States, and a sizable chunk of his voters want Islam banned altogether. That\u2019s the religion of 3.3 million people in the United States. The sad irony is that none of those supporting Trump because he \u201ctells it like it is\u201d or \u201cisn\u2019t politically correct\u201d or is \u201ctough\u201d seems to notice that the man who was honored to have been praised by Russian strongman Vladimir Putin is so weak that he can\u2019t withstand criticism of any kind. He quickly becomes a bully, or gets others to do his dirty work, when he\u2019s frightened by someone who doesn\u2019t simply fall in line. Robbins: It's over; Trump is going to be the Republican nominee His supporters can\u2019t see that the man they are willing to follow off a cliff is little more than an insecure, scared little boy, as evidenced by his constant Twitter rants and obsessive name-calling, targeting anyone who dares challenge him. He is like a middle school bully who tries to strike fear into the hearts of adversaries with childish taunts, because he wants no one to know he has a glass jaw. But for the Republican Party, looking at what happened at Valdosta State University \u2013 with those black students being ejected en masse \u2013 the optics couldn\u2019t be worse. I came into this election cycle arguing that there was one GOP candidate, Rand Paul, who could chip away enough black voters to seriously challenge Hillary Clinton in the fall, because of his clear stance on confronting racial disparities in the criminal justice system. The party quickly tossed him aside and seems on the verge of choosing Trump instead, possibly handing him an insurmountable delegate lead Tuesday night. Trump\u2019s campaign claims it had no knowledge of those black students being thrown out of the rally. Even if that\u2019s true \u2013 a claim that, as we have learned, should not automatically be believed \u2013 Trump\u2019s decision to become a racial demagogue to win votes and increase his influence has guaranteed that those closest to him \u2013 his enforcers \u2013 would have gotten that message one way or another. At this point in the 2016 presidential cycle, what the candidates\u2019 presence on the national stage probably says about the United States means more than what they are saying. Still, how voters respond to what they will hear during the one-on-one interviews on CNN will help to redefine American ideals well into the 21st century.

Wade was senior adviser and national director for African American Vote for Obama for America and deputy chief of staff for U.S. Secretary of Commerce Gary Locke.  He has endorsed Hillary Clinton in this year\u2019s Democratic campaign. Wade is an entrepreneur and president of a global business development firm. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his. Rick Wade says black voters want candidates who can answer the job creation challenge It's not just the \"black lives matter\" issue that will resonate with African-Americans Some may be tired of hearing that black lives matter, but it\u2019s undeniable that in South Carolina and across the South in the states that vote on Super Tuesday and beyond, black votes matter.  African-Americans were the major factor in Hillary Clinton\u2019s landslide victory Saturday in South Carolina, where black voters accounted for more than 60% of the turnout. Republicans have done little to woo black voters. Hillary Clinton trotted out Congressional Black Caucus members; Bernie Sanders recruited state lawmakers. Civil rights icon Rep. John Lewis took up Hillary\u2019s cause. Former NAACP President Ben Jealous has been preaching the gospel of Bernie in black churches. Endorsement spots are running on hip-hop stations. Historically, these tactics have worked at getting out the vote, but they alone won\u2019t cut it. The best way to win black voters is by addressing their most important need: good paying jobs. Why Hillary Clinton beat Bernie Sanders Growing up in South Carolina in the 1970s, a local community leader came to our home during election week to tell my mother who to support. He brought sample ballots. Mom obliged. Those days are over. African-Americans are more knowledgeable and analytical voters, less likely to engage in group think.  Most stay dialed in on politics through cable news and social media like Facebook and Twitter. They want accountability and expect candidates to earn their votes \u2013not simply by incorporating criminal justice reform and voting rights messaging into stump speeches. They want economic policies that support minority businesses and create jobs; and for good reason. Why Tuesday is still super Despite continuous job growth, the black unemployment rate nationally is twice that of whites. Blacks are nearly 14%  of the U.S. population, but own only 7%  of the country\u2019s businesses.  Arguably, the scarcity of thriving minority-owned businesses has contributed to some of the joblessness, the root of many of the ills plaguing poor neighborhoods. In this election year, we can\u2019t afford to see America\u2019s ongoing racial and ethnic transformation in purely political terms \u2013as in, which candidate gains or loses votes cast by an electorate that has more blacks and Latinos and fewer whites. Minorities are clearly a key driver of America\u2019s future economy as the country\u2019s workforce has been changing far more significantly than its politics for the past 36 years. Robbins: It's over; Trump is going to be the Republican nominee By 2020, the white share of the working-age population will have declined by 19 percentage points since 1980.  The share of the working-age population that is made up of minorities will have doubled to 37 percent.  The fact that minorities will make up more than a third of the workforce means that our next president must implement policies that address the economic plight of people of color. I see the economic plight when I return to my hometown of Lancaster.  Folks once worked at the textile mill and patronized black-owned stores, barbershops, and doctor\u2019s offices along a downtown strip called \u201cThe Hill.\u201d When the textile plant closed, so did \u201cThe Hill.\u201d Our tightly knit social structure unraveled.  Eventually, crime and violence increased. GOP is one unhappy family Baltimore is a more recent, extreme portrait of America\u2019s racial and socioeconomic imbalance.  It was on display during last April\u2019s riots that were the manifestation of the residents\u2019 frustration with more than police abuses that prompted violent demonstrations.  Their anger was also rooted in their lack of upward economic mobility. Baltimore\u2019s Southern Baptist Church is rebuilding its apartment complex and community center partially built but set afire during the riots. This may represent change.  But it\u2019s not a tangible indication of the structural economic renaissance that Baltimore and other struggling minority communities need to survive. With these problems staring them in the face not only in South Carolina but across America, what solutions have the candidates presented to create businesses and jobs?  Hillary Clinton has offered plans, but other candidates, including boastful businessman Donald Trump, have not stepped up. Let me be clear:  The president alone should not and cannot solve these problems.  What\u2019s needed is targeted private sector investment in minority communities, anchored with sound government policies, to develop high-growth enterprises and raise wages, in sectors such as energy, technology and manufacturing. Sound policies include freeing up capital for minority businesses; incentivizing major companies to locate in distressed areas; enhancing opportunities to do government work and access markets abroad; promoting innovation and entrepreneurship; and investing in STEM and job training.  These and other measures will help bring minorities living on the margins into the economic mainstream.  However, the challenge for minorities is to align their political strength with their economic needs. In 2012, the percentage of black voters (66.2) exceeded whites (64.1).  For Democrats, high black turnout is essential.  For Republicans, winning a few percentages of black votes can determine the outcome in battleground states.  Black votes can be the swing votes. That\u2019s tremendous power if leveraged correctly. It\u2019s not enough for candidates to just say that black lives matter.  So do businesses and jobs.  These investments will help close the income divide and reduce poverty.  This election should be about more than partisan gamesmanship. It ought to be about policies that bring economic prosperity to all Americans. Join us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion. Read CNNOpinion\u2019s Flipboard magazine.",

Nayaba Arinde: It would be absurd for black people to seek validation for the month from white people, but whites should pay attention How ironic that Africans, the Earth's first people, get ignored by revisionist Eurocentric history, says Arinde The racial issues that simmer unceasingly beneath the surface of America have rushed to the surface again and again over the past year, boiling up as recently as the Grammy Awards last week. Attired in a blue prison uniform and shackles, rapper Kendrick Lamar shuffled out on a stage flanked by prison cells, then challenged viewers with a fiery performance of \u201cThe Blacker the Berry\u201d and his hit, \u201cAlright\u201d as the stage behind him erupted in a bonfire. The performance ended with Lamar standing silhouetted before a map of Africa with the word \u201cCompton\u201d splashed across it. \u201cBlack Twitter\u201d rose up in recognition and solidarity. This hot on the heels of Beyonce\u2019s Super Bowl halftime performance, in which she and a cadre of black female backup dancers invoked the Black Panthers for Self-Defense, Malcolm X and other imagery resonant of the racial struggle in this country and of black empowerment, as she performed \u201cFormation.\u201d Opting to ignore, or deny, Beyonce\u2019s legitimate political critique, some people \u2013 mostly white people, such as former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani \u2013 denounced it. We are in the midst of Black History Month, and with these two high-profile events alone, the need for it could not be more self-evident. But every year, someone questions the legitimacy of this month. Late last month, Fox News contributor Stacey Dash, who is black, dismissed the debate over the lack of black nominees for the Oscars, adding \u2013 ridiculously \u2013 that \u201cif we don\u2019t want segregation, then we have to get rid of channels like BET and the BET Awards and the Image Awards.\u201d She said: \u201cThere shouldn\u2019t be a Black History Month. We\u2019re Americans, period. That\u2019s it.\u201d 'The View' host and actress clash over race comments What the heck are Dash and people who think like her talking about? Black History Month has roots that go back 90 years. One cannot celebrate it without honoring its founder, historian Carter Godwin Woodson. In 1926, Woodson, the founder of the Association for the Study of African American Life and History, launched Negro History Week in recognition of black achievement and contribution. This, of course, evolved into the monthlong celebration. Today, a variety of books and calendars that feature the likes of Harriet Tubman, Frederick Douglass, Muhammad Ali, Malcolm X, Madam C.J. Walker, Dr. Betty Shabazz, Denmark Vesey, Rosa Parks, J.A. Rogers, Sojourner Truth and Marcus Mosiah Garvey, for example. How Kendrick Lamar's fiery performance won Grammy night Most broadly, the month is a time to celebrate the contributions and achievements of black people. But its meaning goes deeper and wider than that for many. To make sense of our ongoing conflicts in America, it\u2019s crucial to understand this. For example, Black History Month is also the acknowledgment of the (relative) collective triumph of black people surviving the African Holocaust \u2013 the Maafa, a term coined by anthropologist Marimba Ani in her 1994 book \u201cYurugu: An African-Centered Critique of European Cultural Thought and Behavior.\u201d Ani writes of the devastation caused by four centuries of enslavement, imperialism, colonialism, Jim Crowism and cultural, economic, social and economic oppression of Africans. This is fundamentally why, Dash-like utterances notwithstanding, it would be absurd for black people to seek validation for our celebratory month from white people. But they would do well to pay attention anyway, particularly in a presidential campaign season. Indeed, a similar time of observance, Black Solidarity Day, was conceived of in 1969 by Dr. Carlos E. Russell, a professor emeritus at Brooklyn College. It was inspired by the play \u201cDay of Absence,\u201d by Douglas Turner Ward, which describes a day \u2013 often before a general election \u2013 when black people are asked to withdraw from the workforce and economy to demonstrate their collective power and influence. Beyonce a political superhero with rhythm Likewise, some see Black History Month as a kind of organizing principle \u2013 an ideal time to strategize about how best to politically, economically and socially harness said power and influence for the betterment of the black community. That aspect is particularly resonant this year in America, with police officers involved in the deaths of black people such as Sandra Bland, Michael Brown, Eric Garner, Rekia Boyd \u2013 among too many, many others \u2013 and still not held responsible for those deaths. And this year, we again saw all-white nominees in the main Oscar categories. It is no great mystery why none of the \u201cblack\u201d movies (\u201cStraight Outta Compton,\u201d \u201cBeasts of No Nation,\u201d or \u201cConcussion\u201d) were nominated for acting awards, what with the Academy\u2019s 94% white voting membership. That is just to name two affronts that make the need for Black History Month obvious. Given this, candidates in both parties have to face the fact that black voters may not show up on Election Day in the post-Barack Obama era. With the Republicans doing their level best to remain the party of \u201cnope\u201d (to voting rights, racial justice and the reduction of inequality), and the Democrats simply assuming they automatically have the vote of black Americans, this could be a white-like-the-Oscars turnout, come November. How ironic that Africans \u2013 the Earth\u2019s first people \u2013 get ignored by revisionist Eurocentric history, but are known to be phenomenal contributors to the sciences, medicine, architecture, agriculture, education, culture and civil society, and yet still, too often, find themselves expected to require the validation of the European-descended to be seen as legitimate. Beyonce: Right voice, right time Thankfully, the works of renowned historians and educators such as Dr. Yosef Ben-Jochannan, Dr. John Henrik Clarke, Dr. Charshee McIntyre, as well as \u201cThe New Jim Crow\u201d author, Michelle Alexander, allow the truth about African heritage to be told and applied in our daily lives. Black History Month has particular meaning if we honor the wonderful people we have read volumes about and seen biopics on, but we must also take heed of the unknown people, the folk who in the light or in the dark do the work  to improve the lives of everyone else. We say thank you to all who came before us and paved the way. That\u2019s why there should be a Black History Month. Join us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion.Read CNNOpinion\u2019s Flipboard magazine.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Jeff Yang is a columnist for The Wall Street Journal and a frequent contributor to radio shows including Public Radio International\u2019s \u201cThe Takeaway\u201d and WNYC\u2019s \u201cThe Brian Lehrer Show.\u201d He is the co-author of \u201cI Am Jackie Chan: My Life in Action\u201d and editor of the graphic novel anthologies \u201cSecret Identities\u201d and \u201cShattered.\u201d The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. Jeff Yang: A new proposal to make Harvard tuition free is really a tactic to take down Affirmative Action The primary beneficiaries of a free Harvard are wealthy applicants whose families can afford to pay For the past two decades, Harvard, the nation\u2019s oldest and arguably most prestigious institution of higher learning, has been a primary front in the assault on Affirmative Action. Since the early 1990s, it has been subject to a nearly continuous series of lawsuits and administrative complaints alleging that its admissions practices, which embrace \u201cholistic\u201d standards of admission that look beyond test scores and grades to take character and cultural context into account, are discriminatory against Asian applicants, whose test scores and grades are on average higher than other applicants. The complaints quietly add that these standards are also discriminatory against whites, who currently make up 52.8% of admittances. Asians make up another 21.1%. These challenges have repeatedly failed, and merely led to a hardening of the ranks between those who believe that Harvard has a moral and educational responsibility to reflect society\u2019s diverse makeup, and those who insist that a Harvard education should be awarded only to those who quantifiably represent the \u201cbest and the brightest.\u201d Recently, a modest proposal by a renegade slate of candidates for Harvard\u2019s Board of Overseers has opened up a new front in this battle and has thrown the neatly drawn lines of combat into chaos. The scheme, put forward by the longtime conservative firebrand Ron Unz and the four candidates he recruited over the Christmas holidays, is deceptively simple. They\u2019re running on the idea of making a Harvard education free for everybody. As in, complimentary, gratis, zero down, zero more to pay ever. Unz\u2019s helpers are Ralph Nader, consumer advocate; Lee Cheng, chief legal counsel for the online retailer NewEgg.com; Stuart Taylor, coauthor of the book \u201cMismatch: How Affirmative Action Hurts Students It\u2019s Intended to Help\u201d; and Stephen Hsu, physicist and Michigan State University vice president of Research and Graduate Studies. Together, they propose eliminating what they call the final obstacle for anyone considering applying for admission, spending down the university\u2019s endowment of $38 billion \u2013 the largest of any educational institution in the world. \u201cEach year, the investment income the university receives from its private equity and securities holdings averages some twenty-five times larger than the net tuition revenue from its 6,600 undergraduate students. Under such circumstances, continuing to charge tuition of up to $180,000 for four years of college education is unconscionable,\u201d they wrote. \u201cIf Harvard abolished tuition the announcement would reach around the world, and soon nearly every family in America would be aware that a Harvard education was now free. Academically successful students from all walks of life would suddenly begin to consider the possibility of attending Harvard.\u201d On the face of it, this seems like an appealing push toward making Harvard into a standard-bearer for educational access. These individuals embody both sides of the political aisle. Yet, even the ostensibly left-leaning members of the group, Hsu and Nader, make it clear that the effort isn\u2019t truly intended to be charitable. The free-tuition initiative is ultimately a bait and switch: Upon election, they intend to demand \u201ctransparency\u201d in Harvard\u2019s admissions process, specifically arguing for the release of data intended to expose what they believe to be persistent anti-Asian (and anti-white) bias. As Hsu put it in a video interview with me: \u201cRon Unz has a history of clever hacks to the political system.\u201d And this one may be his most clever yet. By running a set of candidates whose claimed goal is to give Harvard away for free \u2013 an idea that most conservatives would find anathema and liberals might find worth embracing \u2013 Unz hopes to get hand-picked anti-Affirmative Action representatives onto the college\u2019s second-most powerful leadership body. Of course, Harvard is just the beginning. \u201cNader and Taylor both went to Princeton undergrad, so they say that if this works, Princeton\u2019s next,\u201d says Hsu. Now, even the group admits that for a huge percentage of Harvard undergraduates, tuition is already not a bar: Harvard is already free to any student whose family earns less than $65,000 a year \u2013 a full 20% of the campus population. And students from families who earn up to $150,000 must pay no more than 10% of their household income. And students whose families who earn more pay on a sliding scale; the percentage of Harvard students who pay full tuition is less than a third. So does it make sense for Harvard to cost nothing for its undergrad 6,694 students, while tuitions for state, city and community colleges \u2013 which serve the tremendous majority of low-income individuals, immigrants and racial and ethnic minorities \u2013 continue to spiral upward? Of course it doesn\u2019t, especially when the primary beneficiary of the charity will be wealthy applicants whose families can afford to pay, and whose tuitions go to defray the cost of scholarship attendees. But this isn\u2019t really about charity. For Unz and for a larger group of individuals whom I\u2019ll call \u201cAdmissions Truthers,\u201d the campaign is about revealing a vast conspiracy designed to advance blacks and Hispanics at the expense of Asians (and, quietly, whites). To Admissions Truthers, holistic admissions are seen as nothing but a tool to hide discrimination and prop up unqualified blacks and Hispanics. They say that achieving transparency \u2013 by openly releasing applicant data \u2013 will demonstrate how Asians (and, quietly, whites) are actively disqualified on the basis of race. The truth is that scores and grades are not the only determinant of merit. The qualities that make people truly exceptional achievers can\u2019t be measured solely by grades and standardized tests. This is why some of the most famous Harvard alums aren\u2019t those who graduated with the highest honors, but those who dropped out to change the world. Harvard\u2019s own Graduate School of Education recently issued a report recommending a radical change to the rubric by which college applicants are measured, proposing that instead of assigning merit solely to academic achievement, admissions offices should give greater weight to community contributions, charitable works and acts of service for the common good. This might include caring for younger siblings or family elders, or working for Habitat for Humanity, or tutoring and mentoring underprivileged kids. The objective: Encouraging \u201cethical engagement\u201d as well as \u201cintellectual engagement,\u201d and rewarding future leaders who\u2019ve demonstrated character and traits associated with good citizenship. Of course, Admissions Truthers are already calling the report a new assault on \u201cmeritocracy.\u201d But that\u2019s just a matter of definition. Is humanity better served in fostering generations of young leaders whose sole interest is personal advancement via individual achievement and cutthroat competition? Maybe it\u2019s time to embrace a vision of merit that accords \u201cbest and brightest\u201d status to hearts and souls, as well as minds.

The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. Paul Waldman: Donald Trump says racist-sounding things, but claims he's no racist Researcher says Woody Guthrie writings condemned racist practices of Fred Trump, Donald Trump's father Waldman: Son's not condemned for sins of father, but it's fair to ask about a candidate's attitude on race, with regard to family history Donald Trump, he would have you know, is no racist. Not only that, \u201cI am the least racist person you have ever met,\u201d as he told CNN\u2019s Don Lemon, which is a pretty high compliment to himself. Nevertheless, it seems that hardly a week goes by in this campaign without Trump doing or saying something to make observers say, \u201cOh yeah, that\u2019s pretty racist.\u201d Some of them are planned, like his accusation that Mexican immigrants are rapists and drug dealers, or his proposal to ban Muslims from entering the United States. Others appear impulsive, like his retweeting missives from neo-Nazis and white supremacists. But they add up to a picture of someone who, whatever might lie within the depths of his soul, is more than happy to activate and exploit racist feelings among the voters he wants to appeal to. It\u2019s no accident that a white nationalist group is currently robocalling Iowa voters to encourage them to vote for Trump. And we have just learned of a fascinating story in the history of race in America that brings a deeper perspective to Trump\u2019s current persona. Will Kaufman, a British academic who has written extensively about legendary folk singer Woody Guthrie, was doing research in the Guthrie archives when he came across a notebook in which Guthrie condemned the racist practices of his landlord. Kaufman described what he found in an article in The Conversation. It was a New York apartment Guthrie rented in 1950, in a development called Beach Haven. He was so outraged that he wrote verses about the landlord, including one to the tune of \u201cI Ain\u2019t Got No Home,\u201d one of his signature songs. The landlord was one Fred Trump, none other than Donald Trump\u2019s father, the man who taught the presidential candidate the real estate business, set him up on his own with what Trump recently described as \u201ca small loan of a million dollars,\u201d and raised him to be what he is today. \u201cYou are a king,\u201d Fred would tell young Donald, as Michael D\u2019Antonio relates in his recent biography, \u201cNever Enough.\u201d And also: \u201cBe a killer.\u201d It\u2019s some small defense of Fred Trump to say that though he excluded black people from his buildings, it wasn\u2019t his innovation; it was part of a comprehensive system of discrimination. The elder Trump built Beach Haven at the behest of the federal government, as part of a program to establish housing that would go in part to World War II veterans. Though there were accusations of corruption in the program (at one point Trump was hauled before a Senate committee to explain his billing practices), few at the time questioned how the federal government set out to systematically keep black people out of the buildings it was funding. As Richard Rothstein wrote last year for the Economic Policy Institute, \u201cAfrican Americans were prevented from moving to white neighborhoods by explicit policy of the Federal Housing Administration (FHA), which barred suburban subdivision developers from qualifying for federally subsidized construction loans unless the developers committed to exclude African Americans from the community. \u201cThe FHA also barred African Americans themselves from obtaining bank mortgages for house purchases even in suburban subdivisions which were privately financed without federal construction loan guarantees.\u201d Those federal policies are gone today, and the \u201credlining\u201d they produced is now illegal, but their legacy lives on,in the dramatically low rates of wealth African-Americans have been able to amass through home ownership. But what does this have to do with Donald Trump? While Trump might rather show you his solid gold toilets than talk about what he learned about race from his father, the fact is that his real estate empire was built on the foundation Fred Trump laid. Trump turns America back to its shameful past Of course, no politician should be held responsible for the sins of his father. But at the very least, Donald Trump should be asked what he thought of housing segregation at the time and how it helps shape his perspective today, particularly since he was such an enthusiastic student of Fred Trump\u2019s business. White politicians who grew up in the South during segregation are often asked to account for the feelings they had and the actions they took when they were younger and they were witnesses to such a cruel system of oppression. And while few condemn them for not standing up against Jim Crow when doing so carried great risk, at a minimum we expect them to have developed some perspective on it in the time since. We want to know how their youth shaped their current beliefs about equality, justice, and the way government at all levels can liberate people or persecute them. This campaign has already taught us a lot about Donald Trump\u2019s feelings on race, none of it encouraging. Some people think it\u2019s all an act, nothing more than opportunistic exploitation of prevailing sentiments that Trump would cast off as soon as he faced a general election. Maybe. But maybe his comfort with the politics of discrimination has deeper roots. Join us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion.Read CNNOpinion\u2019s Flipboard magazine.",

He is the author of \u201cJimmy Carter\u201d and \u201cThe Fierce Urgency of Now: Lyndon Johnson, Congress, and the Battle for the Great Society.\u201d The opinions expressed in this commentary are his. GOP leaders lamenting the rise of Trump and Cruz should blame themselves, writes Julian Zelizer For decades, the party has been eager to get the votes of aggressive conservative base,  he says A number of prominent Republicans have been complaining about what is happening to their party. \u201cRarely has a party so passively accepted its own self-destruction,\u201d lamented New York Times columnist David Brooks. He and others have complained that Donald Trump and Ted Cruz are hijacking the GOP, moving the party of Lincoln and Reagan into an extreme realm of politics that will forever damage its standing. Palin: God's gift to Trump The National Review, the most influential conservative publication since World War II, has published a special issue in which the editors state their opposition to Donald Trump, calling him a threat to the political tradition they have promoted: \u201cDonald Trump is a menace to American conservatism who would take the work of generations and trample it underfoot on behalf of a populism as heedless and crude as The Donald himself.\u201d On Capitol Hill, the leadership has continually warned that the conservative obstructionism of the tea-party oriented Freedom Caucus has devastated public opinion about Republicans as a party that can govern. John Boehner complained about the caucus when he stepped down, saying, \u201cGarbagemen get used to the smell of bad garbage.\u201d The new speaker, Paul Ryan, has expressed similar concerns about the rhetoric coming from the campaign trail. But Republicans have nobody to blame but themselves. The party needs to own up to the kind of politics that we now have. The style promoted by Trump, Cruz and the entire tea party is a conscious product of the key decisions and strategic choices that mainstream Republican leaders have been making for decades. Republican leaders have been forming alliances with an aggressive right wing party base for a long time. Just pick up any good history about Ronald Reagan and it quickly becomes evident that some of the biggest candidates in the party have relied on the conservative base to achieve election victories. When Reagan first proved he was a serious force in the 1976 Republican primaries (losing to Gerald Ford, but barely), one internal administration memo warned that the right-wing groups turning out exhibited a \u201c\u2018rule-or-ruin\u2019 attitude toward the GOP.\u201d In 1980, Reagan courted the Moral Majority and other right-wing activists like Paul Weyrich as part of the coalition through which he defeated Jimmy Carter. Even though many were disappointed he did not do enough for their issues in his first term, they joined him again in his landslide 1984 victory against Walter Mondale. Dear Ted Cruz... Prominent figures on the right such as Edwin Meese held high-profile positions in the administration. While George H.W. Bush liked to think of himself as distinct from the rank-and-file, his 1988 campaign fully embraced the movement\u2019s central message by castigating Massachusetts Gov.r Michael Dukakis as a left-of-center Democrat for supporting the ACLU. Under the direction of Lee Atwater, the Republicans ran blistering campaigns that played on racial tensions in the electorate and leveled accusations that Democrats were weak on defense. George H.W. Bush was equally careful to make room for neoconservative hawks, supply-side zealots and religious conservatives. In 2008, Sen. John McCain, who had gained his fame as a maverick independent, picked Alaska Governor Sarah Palin as his vice presidential nominee, and she became a voice for the most recent incarnation of conservatism. Palin had the support of many \u201cestablishment Republicans,\u201d including Bill Kristol. Last week Palin endorsed Trump. As Kathleen Parker wrote in the Washington Post, \u201conce Republicans forced the party to take the governor of Alaska seriously as a vice presidential candidate, they opened a populist door that they\u2019ll not easily shut.\u201d In the House of Representatives, Republican leaders were more than welcoming to the tea party revolution that took hold in 2010 \u2014 until it no longer suited their purposes. John Boehner and Mitch McConnell welcomed the energy and enthusiasm that tea party activists brought to the fight against President Barack Obama. While the activists might have pushed the boundaries of acceptable partisan compact with threats like allowing the government to go into default, the discipline as a voting block and willingness to stand up to an ambitious President helped, in the leadership\u2019s minds, to revitalize the standing of the party. Or at least that\u2019s what Boehner thought before he felt he had to leave. GOP leaders distance themselves from Ted Cruz The conservatism of Ted Cruz reflects the general direction the party has taken since the 1980s. Most of the best social science research on this issue, such as that of Norm Ornstein and Tom Mann, makes clear that there has been a decisive shift to the right among Republicans that has been much faster and more dramatic than what occurred in the Democratic Party. The moderates in the GOP would have been considered conservative just a decade ago. The kind of smashmouth, in-your-face politics that Trump and Cruz have been practicing in recent months is also born out of an era of conservative cable television and Internet outlets that have promoted this aggressive style of discourse. For decades, conservative talk radio, which flourished in the 1980s, has been a major outlet for lashing out against political correctness. Hosts like Bob Grant, who cut his teeth in New York talk radio at the same time  Trump came into the media spotlight, spread this talk all over the airwaves. Conservative media outlets like Fox News and Internet sites like the Daily Caller or The Drudge Report encouraged Republicans to take a tougher approach against Democrats as well as their own leaders who were too cozy with the opposition. The hosts on these outlets and the talking heads accepted a no-holds-barred style of conversation. This media environment became a regular outlet for many Republican politicians, who learned to talk this lingo to make sure they received airtime. At the heart of the Cruz and Trump campaign is an essential message that has been a central theme of conservatism in the post-World War II period: that Washington is never good and career politicians are without virtue. Their anti-politics rhetoric comes directly out of the \u201cconservative establishment\u201d politics that formed in the 1970s and 1980s. \u201cGovernment is not the solution to our problem; government is the problem,\u201d Reagan said. Republicans have blasted government as ineffective and inefficient. Markets always work better, the say. In the minds of many conservatives, government bureaucrats, whether they work in the Department of Education or the IRS, are incompetent at best and evil at worst. Almost every major Republican presidential candidate has campaigned on this theme. Thus, it is not a surprise to see the Washington establishment is once again the enemy. In this respect, the message of Trump and Cruz is as traditional as can be. It is certainly true that Trump has supported a number of issues, such as higher taxes, that don\u2019t fit well within the party orthodoxy. But even with that, his basic message and his political style fit well with trends that we have seen in Republican politics. Republicans might want to complain about what they are seeing unfold before them. But this has deep-rooted connections to the kind of politics the party has been practicing.  If Jeb Bush and John Kasich feel as if they are being pushed out by the \u201canti-establishment\u201d mavericks, they need to acknowledge that these candidates are of their party\u2019s own making. The alliance, the ideas, the rhetoric and the style have all come from the heart of Republican politics. The only difference is that some of the major leaders no longer feel as if they are in control. Join us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion.Read CNNOpinion\u2019s Flipboard magazine.",

A nationally syndicated columnist, she is an adjunct professor at Georgetown University and author of \u201cCooking with Grease: Stirring the Pots in America.\u201d The opinions expressed in this commentary are hers. Donna Brazile: Had he lived, Martin Luther King Jr. would have turned 87 on Friday She says he would have been urging a more inclusive America, as we still try to overcome racial inequality This Monday, we commemorate the 30th anniversary of the federal holiday in honor of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. It\u2019s a holiday that thankfully has been gaining in recognition since Congress passed a bill and President Ronald Reagan signed it in 1983, designating the third Monday in January, starting in 1986, to honor the civil rights leader. For years, some states declined to participate in the holiday, and Arizona lost the opportunity to host a Super Bowl over it. In 2000, South Carolina became the last state to recognize the holiday. Still, a Bloomberg BNA survey found last year that fewer than 40% of American workers are given the day off \u2013 about the same as Presidents Day and far behind the nearly universal observance of such holidays as Thanksgiving, Christmas, Memorial Day, July 4 and Labor Day. Whether or not you have the day off, it\u2019s worth reflecting on the life and philosophy of the man we honor Monday. Had an assassin\u2019s bullet not taken his life at the age of 39, King would have turned 87 on Friday. Had he lived, I believe King would have continued to inspire hope and would challenge us to fulfill his dream of a more inclusive society \u2013 where everyone would have an equal opportunity for \u201clife, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.\u201d No doubt King, who was passionate about justice and equality for all, would have been proud of all the milestones we have achieved as a nation, including the election of our first black president of the United States. Nevertheless, King would have urged us to move beyond our internal divisions of political partisanship and to find common ground. King believed that \u201chate is too great a burden to bear\u201d and that we should not \u201cseek to satisfy our thirst of freedom by drinking from the cup of bitterness and hatred.\u201d So, where are we on race relations?  Is it OK to even talk about it?  Some say \u201ccolor blindness\u201d means that even mentioning race is wrong \u2013 even when pointing out an injustice. As we have seen over the last few years, the country has stumbled backward. Not only are we reopening old wounds with regard to confrontation with law enforcement, we are also relitigating everything from voting rights to affirmative action. And now we confront, for the second year in a row, Hollywood \u2013 which somehow ignores the talent of people of color when it comes to the Oscars. (#Oscars so white) With the headlines screaming about everything from black young men being gunned down by police in Chicago to mass incarceration, and with officials ignoring calls for reconciliation \u2013 or worse, blaming poor people for their own predicament \u2013 it\u2019s easy to become depressed, apathetic or simply give up. But that is not King\u2019s legacy. He saw defeats as temporary. He saw opposition as a challenge. He believed that most people want truth and justice, that most people would lend their voices to promote the freedom and dignity of all. It was his faith, determination and hope, as much as his words, that sustained and inspired a generation to be actively engaged in the political process as voters \u2013 and thus working to transform our nation by electing men and women of valor who sought to remove barriers and open once-closed doors to all. That was part of King\u2019s vision \u2013 as he stated back in 1957 when he called on the country to \u201cgive us the ballot.\u201d King once said, \u201cIf you can\u2019t run, then walk. If you can\u2019t walk, then crawl. But whatever you do, you have to keep moving forward.\u201d We can thank King\u2019s generation and their children for the fact that open racism, based on hatred, is no longer acceptable in America. Malicious racism is largely behind us. Yet, for many blacks and other people of color, our journey is not over as we strive to get to King\u2019s \u201cpromised land.\u201d Little girls attending Sunday school are no longer being bombed, with the perpetrators going unpunished for decades. But we still have too many instances like Sandra Bland being found dead in her jail cell or young men being fatally shot as they walked, unarmed, peacefully away from law enforcement. Justice seems elusive. So how do we honor King when there are those in our society who continue to exploit racial fears and to demonize those from different religious backgrounds or traditions? No one knew better than King of disappointment, yet he remained determined not to be discouraged. He saw in his own lifetime that racism was shifting from malicious, violent discrimination to softer means such as excluding people from voting, or from access to promotions in the workplace, or from access to certain careers, or from ever being able to rise above hand-to-mouth wages and salaries. The good news is, despite an onslaught of politicians who have a vested interest in excusing and fostering bias based on racial fears, Pew Research finds that the majority of Americans believe the country needs to continue to take measures to give equal rights to blacks and everyone. We remain in a struggle to fight racism, a struggle all the tougher because racism has gone underground or hides its true intentions. Some studies refer to it as unconscious bias. Twenty-first century racism wears many disguises, including stereotyping immigrants as criminals \u2013 with only some being \u201cgood people.\u201d The new racism holds that those who do the discriminating are actually the victims of discrimination, if a policy seeks to give people of color more access to their \u201carea.\u201d We must continue to find ways to achieve racial reconciliation through dialogue and by working together to tear down institutional racism that prevents some folks with names like Janae or Jamil from being called in for an interview, though they meet the qualifications. Finally, King believed in diversity. Diversity, the chorus of different voices, should be a song of harmony. As Americans, we cannot deny our heritage, our individual cultures, but rather we must continue to bring all that is good and just to the civic enterprise. King\u2019s legacy is action in the service of others. For he believed that \u201cnot everybody can be famous, but everybody can be great, because greatness is determined by service.\u201d So, whether on  the job or off, let\u2019s use this day to commit ourselves to service through acts of goodness and kindness. Let\u2019s continue his work in the vineyards of justice and equality for all. And let us begin to live in what King called \u201cthe fierce urgency of now.\u201d Join us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion.Read CNNOpinion\u2019s Flipboard magazine.",

            "article_content": "Democratic candidates debated Sunday night, two weeks before the Iowa caucus Commentators say Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton offered sharp contrasts The Democratic candidates for President debated in South Carolina Sunday, two weeks before the Iowa caucus. CNN Opinion asked commentators, including several in the early primary states, for their takes on the debate. The opinions expressed are theirs. It\u2019s widely believed that the Democratic National Committee has done its best to restrict the number of debates \u2013 and tonight it became obvious why. Hillary Clinton was outperformed by Bernie Sanders, who embarrassed the establishment favorite and helped drive the Democrats further to the left. The man\u2019s anger is raw and pure. I have a long list of utility companies I\u2019d love him to call on my behalf. Sanders kept returning to the theme of campaign finance reform as a way of driving a wedge between himself and Clinton. It underscores Bernie\u2019s outsider status and gives him a \u201cgolden bullet\u201d policy \u2013 an answer to all of America\u2019s problems that\u2019s as understandable and straightforward as Donald Trump\u2019s wall. Sanders deployed it best when pointing out that Clinton has received speaker\u2019s fees from Goldman Sachs. This is true. Last year, CNN reported that: \u201cClinton made $3.15 million in 2013 alone from speaking to firms like Morgan Stanley, Goldman Sachs, Deutsche Bank and UBS.\u201d But while most of America would agree that special interest politics is bad and Wall Street too powerful, the rest of the discussion in South Carolina was way to the left of mainstream opinion. For the first 30 minutes, each candidate pledged to raise spending, reduce access to guns and crack down on alleged racism in the criminal justice system. The rush to condemn the police, for instance, is bound to come back to haunt the eventual nominee in the general election. So too will the reluctance to talk about foreign policy, which was treated as an academic afterthought. With everybody\u2019s eyes on Trump\u2019s campaign in the Republican primary, our attentions are distracted by the quieter, but no less polarizing process of radicalization taking place among Democrats. No attempt was made in the debate to reach out to rural voters, religious voters or those troubled by a recent increase in violent crime in some cities. Conservatives have become more ideological \u2013 of this we are constantly reminded. But so, too, have liberals. How else to explain why Bernie Sanders, a self-described socialist, is running ahead of Clinton in New Hampshire? It\u2019s no surprise that he\u2019s doing particularly well among the young. Clinton is running more to the left than usual but still has the aura of \u201cstatus quo\u201d about her. For voters under 40, the status quo won\u2019t do. Obamacare has offered them a bad deal, college tuition is bankrupting them, jobs are poorly paid and racial tension is high. The kids don\u2019t want to return to a 1990s idyll that they can\u2019t even remember. They want serious, radical change. Meanwhile, the clear loser of the night was poor old Martin O\u2019Malley \u2013 who lacked the charisma to keep up with his opponents. The only thing he said during one question round was \u201cgood question.\u201d The smartest thing he could do for his historical reputation would be to drop out before the voting begins. Timothy Stanley is a historian and columnist for Britain\u2019s Daily Telegraph. He is the author of \u201cCitizen Hollywood: How the Collaboration Between L.A. and D.C. Revolutionized American Politics.\u201d Throughout heated exchanges on guns, health care and other issues in Sunday\u2019s Democratic candidate debate, two things were clear:  First, both Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton are exceptionally strong when on the attack but ineffective, if not downright unappealing, when on the defense. Whichever of them wins the nomination (and sorry, Gov. O\u2019Malley, it\u2019s likely going to be one of those two) they have to get much better at being graceful under attack, or even turning the attack to their advantage.  Because this is going to be an ugly, attack-filled general election. The other takeaway: This was an astonishingly substantive debate, especially if you compare it with the vacuous, petty Republican debates.  In those debates, we learn what the Republicans don\u2019t like about each others\u2019 hair and faces and what they don\u2019t like about President Obama. In this debate, though, we not only learned the Democratic candidates\u2019 positions in broad strokes but in detail \u2013 not just that they want to raise wages for working people and rein in Wall Street, but some details about their different tax policies and who would or would not reinstate Glass Steagall.  And Sanders touted his new proposal to create Medicare for all, while Clinton accused Sanders of wanting to scrap the Affordable Care Act instead of embracing and improving it. The simple fact is that all three of the Democratic contenders proved themselves to be thoughtful, knowledgeable, visionary leaders.  I can\u2019t imagine anyone objectively watching can universally say the same thing about the GOP crop of candidates.  It\u2019s a debate that made me proud to be a Democrat. But did it sway any voters?  Well. I was watching with one, my mother-in-law Gloria.  She considers herself a Sanders supporter but, as the debate ended, told me she didn\u2019t see a lot of difference between the Democratic candidates: \u201cTheir basic ideas are similar.\u201d This is probably a good signal for Clinton.  In an era of economic populism, faced with an opponent who plainly challenges her coziness with Wall Street, that Clinton can erase any sense of difference between her and Sanders is a victory for Clinton. Meanwhile, what does it come down to for Gloria?  \u201cWho can actually get things done.\u201d  And that also, I\u2019m afraid, favors Clinton.  It\u2019s just hard to see Sanders, with his wagging finger, unkempt hair and old-guy-I-don\u2019t-care attitude as someone who could actually be President, let alone find ways to bridge the hyper-partisan divide and intransigence my mother-in-law describes as a major concern.

If voters want further proof that the Republican and Democratic presidential races are unfolding in parallel political universes, they need look no further than the two recent debates from each party. None of the Democratic presidential hopefuls at last night\u2019s debate in South Carolina mentioned national security as a top three priority for the first 100 days in office.  Contrast that with a Republican presidential debate on Thursday, in which candidates focused almost exclusively on the threat of global terrorism and ISIS. Hillary Clinton\u2019s strategy once again consisted of being the smartest, best-prepared student in class.  She did her homework, hitting Bernie Sanders with a litany of details about his voting record on gun control and health care. Clinton has pushed the gun control issue in New Hampshire, where polls show a majority of Democratic voters favor some sort of reform. Clinton emphasized her experience, competence and continuity with President Obama in the debate, no small matter in South Carolina, where Obama is very popular with the many African-American voters in the state. Bernie Sanders continued to be a man on an economic mission, full of populist passion, with a tendency to reduce his policy prescriptions to eradicating the evils associated with the millionaires and billionaires who populate PACs, Wall Street banks and insurance companies. This approach has really resonated with progressives in New Hampshire, where Sanders leads in most polls.  Sanders handled an intense workout in the debate, but he needs to get better at explaining policy specifics underlying the larger principles about which he is so passionate.  He has a tendency to speak in universal terms, which has also hurt him with the Black Lives Matter movement in the past. Martin O\u2019Malley was a good sport, but was largely a sidebar in the debate, reduced to parenthetical comments on the Clinton-Sanders engagement, occasional anecdotes about Baltimore and asking the moderators for more time. On balance, the debate will not likely have a significant impact on the race\u2019s overall dynamic.  For all the talk of Clinton continuity versus Sanders revolution, this spirited debate was a rather orderly affair, especially by Republican debate standards. Dean Spiliotes is a Southern New Hampshire University Civic Scholar and founder of NHPoliticalCapital.com. Both Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders had deficits to overcome and opportunities to do so \u2026 and for the most part, they both squandered them. With Sanders\u2019 recent gains in the polls \u2013 in Iowa, in New Hampshire, among women, among young people \u2013 in large part because of his push for universal health care, Clinton needed to take on his new plan on substance. It was released just hours before the debate, but it didn\u2019t require any in-depth analysis. It would raise taxes on the middle class, and that\u2019s all she needed to say. Instead, she decided to stick with the ridiculously Clintonian narrative that Sanders is against Obamacare, and thus against Obama. It looked small, petty and unserious. Sanders\u2019 plan will out-tax Sweden, and yet he walked away from that debate the winner. On the other side, Sanders is getting slammed by Clinton on his gun record. It\u2019s a smart play for her \u2013 his nuanced and Vermont-focused votes on various gun legislation will not be understood or appreciated by most Democratic, anti-gun voters. However, she\u2019s used the gun issue to smear his character time and again. After Clinton railed against his gun positions tonight, painting him out to be a blood-thirsty gun nut, the debate moderators (inexplicably) didn\u2019t ask him to respond. Even more inexplicably, he didn\u2019t ask to. The last words voters heard on guns were Hillary\u2019s, and that\u2019s to his great detriment. S.E. Cupp is the author of \u201cLosing Our Religion: The Liberal Media\u2019s Attack on Christianity,\u201d co-author of \u201cWhy You\u2019re Wrong About the Right\u201d and a columnist at the New York Daily News. Sunday night, Hillary Clinton proved, again, that she\u2019s maybe the most experienced, qualified candidate in the field. Bernie Sanders talked like the revolutionary, particularly against the influence of money in our politics, but did not extend his daring to another vital issue. Clinton remained the prose, Sanders the poetry, of the campaign. (Martin O\u2019Malley still doesn\u2019t belong on the stage.) Clinton\u2019s embrace of President Obama during the debate will endear her to black South Carolina voters who\u2019ve been outraged by the disrespect they felt he\u2019s had to endure the past seven years. Sanders\u2019 inability to come up with a clear answer on gun control will hurt him with those same voters. On everything else, he is the dreamer. He doesn\u2019t accept limitations on what can be done on health care and reforming Wall Street, each an enormous task. On guns \u2013 one of the most important issues for the Democrats in the audience \u2013 Sanders sounded tentative, as though he was forced to say something he doesn\u2019t believe. That might play well in Iowa and New Hampshire, but not in the Palmetto State among the voters Sanders needs most. They are looking for a moonshot to curb gun violence, while it sounds as though Sanders would do little more than maintain the status quo. If Sanders is serious about breaking through beyond the first two states, he must show a greater willingness to be bold in areas other than railing against Wall Street. Issac Bailey has been a journalist in South Carolina for the past two decades and was most recently the primary columnist for The Sun News in Myrtle Beach. He was a 2014 Harvard University Nieman Fellow. Twitter: @ijbailey The Democrats put on a surprisingly lively debate.  The big question before the debate was whether Sanders would go after Clinton hard.  He did on several issues. Sanders was strong on the health care issue as he was more aspirational, arguing for universal health care, compared to Clinton\u2019s pragmatic approach of building on Obamacare. She noted that she didn\u2019t want to have a big argument over health care again which seemed to undercut her claim to be a fighter. Sanders also went after Clinton hard on the banking issue, noting that she had given paid speeches for Goldman Sachs. Where Sanders missed an opportunity was in not criticizing Clinton on some of the foreign policy issues.  That wasn\u2019t a particular surprise, but it\u2019s also an area where Clinton shows some weakness with voters. Even so, foreign policy and national security were little mentioned in the debate as Democrats tend to focus much more on domestic issues. In fact, none of the candidates mentioned either foreign policy or national security as being among their first priorities as president. O\u2019Malley was all but invisible in the debate.  That\u2019s no surprise given his low polling numbers, but interesting given that his supporters in the Iowa caucuses could very well have a significant effect on whether Clinton or Sanders wins the state. Speaking of Iowa, it\u2019s not likely that the debate will do much to sway caucus-goers.  Many would likely prefer Sanders\u2019 position on several issues but are concerned about his electability. The Sanders campaign has the greater enthusiasm, but the question is whether Iowa Democrats will opt for a candidate they feel has a better chance to win in the general election.  Eight years ago they took a chance on Barack Obama and won.  We\u2019ll find out on February 1 if that happens again.

Tonight\u2019s Democratic debate separated the adults from the children.  This forum from South Carolina made all of the Republican debates so far deserving of the moniker \u201cKids\u2019 Table.\u201d Although Hillary Clinton, Bernie Sanders and Martin O\u2019Malley voiced their policy differences with passion, there were no insults.  There was no name-calling or grandstanding.  There were no \u201cbirther\u201d distractions.  Instead we had two hours of substantive debate over genuine issues. This was a win for viewers.  It is a shame that this event took place under the auspices of what might be called the \u201cDemocratic National Committee Witness Protection Program\u201d \u2013 which scheduled the debate on a holiday weekend during the football playoffs and against \u201cDownton Abbey.\u201d It is worth noting that, when asked what their priorities would be in their first 100 days in office, none of the three candidates mentioned ISIS. There was some Olympic-level pivoting on display tonight.  When Sanders was asked about his lack of minority support, he quickly segued into mention of how well he would do against Donald Trump in a general election.  Nearly every time Sanders challenged Clinton on their health care differences, she responded by invoking her loyalty to President Obama, thereby dodging the actual questions. Still, it is hard to pick a clear winner.  Sanders had Clinton on the defensive over her ties to Wall Street and her resistance to universal health care for all.  His reminder to viewers that Clinton received large speaking fees from Goldman Sachs was spot on, as it neatly distilled the arguments over financial reform to a question of allegiance. Clinton in turn smoothly pushed back at Sanders on his uneven record of support for gun control (he voted five times against the Brady Bill, which required that everyone who bought a gun to wait five days for local authorities to conduct criminal background checks). Clinton also shone in the foreign policy and national security discussions, displaying her ease and familiarity with these complicated issues.  Both candidates scored strong points for themselves, so let\u2019s call the evening a draw between them.  And bravo to both of them for mentioning the Flint, Michigan water crisis in their final remarks. Sad to say, the loser of the night was O\u2019Malley. He barely qualified for this debate, which may have been his last, best chance to make an impression on potential voters. Yet he was a third wheel throughout the evening and had to beg for questions and for response time. At one point, he pleaded with moderator Lester Holt for \u201cjust ten seconds!\u201d \u2013 but Holt ignored him and cut to a commercial.  To his credit, O\u2019Malley noted in his closing statement that there has been no discussion of immigration reform, immigration detention, the Central American refugee crisis or the treatment of Puerto Rico by hedge funds. It was surprising that there was no discussion of women\u2019s reproductive rights, an important issue to the Democratic base. The most memorable moment of the evening may have been when Clinton was asked to characterize her relationship with Vladimir Putin.  With a smile, she carefully described it as \u201cinteresting\u201d \u2013 making the relationship between two world figures sound like a Facebook status update.  She seemed to suggest that yes, it\u2019s complicated. Raul A. Reyes is an attorney and member of the USA Today board of contributors. Follow him @RaulAReyes. Hillary Clinton was solid and Bernie Sanders turned in his best debate performance yet in Charleston. I suspect these moments will particularly resonate with Iowa caucus-goers, based on my conversations with hundreds of Iowa Democrats and on how I\u2019ve seen crowds react to the candidates. Best moments for Clinton: \u2022 Reminding viewers that she has stood up to Republicans and remains their primary target. For instance, Clinton noted that Karl Rove is running ads against her, financed by wealthy donors, because \u201cI\u2019m the one they don\u2019t want to be up against.\u201d \u2022 Hailing President Barack Obama\u2019s key domestic and foreign policy achievements and promising to build on his legacy. \u2022 Speaking passionately about \u201csystemic racism\u201d in the criminal justice system. Although the African-American electorate is not nearly as big a factor in Iowa as it will be in South Carolina, Iowa audiences have responded favorably when candidates have spoken about such issues, and black voters will be a significant presence in numerous Iowa precincts on February 1. \u2022 Closing the debate with a powerful statement of outrage over lead-poisoned water in the largely poor and majority African-American city of Flint, Michigan. For Sanders: \u2022 Parrying criticism of his single-payer health care proposal. Evoking the dream of FDR and Harry Truman to enact universal health care, Sanders argued that the money middle-class families could save on private health insurance premiums would more than compensate for higher taxes. \u2022 Highlighting Clinton\u2019s ties to Wall Street, including $600,000 in personal speaking fees from Goldman Sachs. \u2022 Repeatedly returning to the problem of a \u201crigged\u201d economy and \u201ccorrupt\u201d campaign finance system, which gives too much power to billionaires and corporate interests.

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Akhil Reed Amar is a professor of constitutional law at Yale University and the author of \u201cThe Law of the Land: A Grand Tour of Our Constitutional Republic.\u201d The opinions expressed in this commentary are his. Akhil Reed Amar: Congress, not the courts, decides if Cruz is eligible to be elected president He says the key point is that the law in effect at Cruz's birth makes him a natural born citizen I do not embrace Ted Cruz politically, but I do embrace his right to run for president, and so should you. Here is our first question:  Who decides whether Cruz is eligible?  My answer:  At first, you do.  We, the people, do.  We do this on Election Day when we cast our ballots with the Constitution in our hearts and minds if not in our hands.  If you think Cruz is ineligible \u2014 if what I say here does not persuade you \u2014 you can vote against him. If Cruz gets enough electoral votes this fall, then Congress and not the Supreme Court should be the final legal judge of Cruz\u2019s eligibility. The Constitution\u2019s 12th Amendment clearly says that Congress counts the electoral votes at a special session; and thus Congress is constitutionally authorized to refuse to count any electoral votes that Congress considers invalid. GOP debate: The Trump-Cruz smackdown Elsewhere, Article I, section 5 of the Constitution makes clear that each house of Congress may \u201cjudge\u201d whether a would-be member of that house meets the constitutional eligibility rules for that house.  Suppose Mr. Smith wants to go to Washington as a senator.  He wins election in his home state.  But the Constitution says a senator must be 30 years old. If a dispute arises about Smith\u2019s age, about whether there a proper birth certificate and what it says, the Constitution clearly says the Senate is \u201cthe judge\u201d of Smith\u2019s birth certificate dispute. Similarly, for presidential elections the Constitution\u2019s structure makes Congress the judge of any birth certificate dispute or any other issue of presidential eligibility.  Congress cannot fabricate new presidential eligibility rules but it is the judge of the eligibility rules prescribed in the Constitution. Thus, ordinary courts should butt out, now and forever.  They have no proper role here, because the Constitution itself makes Congress the special judge.  In legal jargon, the issue is a \u201cnonjusticiable political question.\u201d Presidents should pick judges, not vice versa.  This is one reason why the Supreme Court\u2019s 2000 ruling in Bush v. Gore was a disgrace and is now widely viewed by experts as such. Ordinary courts should butt out, now and forever. Akhil Reed Amar OK, so voters and Congress decide, but what is the right answer to the Cruz question and how can ordinary citizens deduce this right answer? Simple: We can read the Constitution, which was written for ordinary citizens.  And then we can fold in a few simple points about constitutional history, tradition and common sense. Cruz dismisses 'swamp theories' on citizenship Article II requires that a president must be either a U.S. citizen \u201cat the time of the Adoption of this Constitution\u201d \u2014 that is, 1788 \u2014 or else \u201ca natural born Citizen.\u201d  Though old-fashioned, Cruz was not around in 1788.  So he needs to be \u2014 just like everyone else running for president today \u2014 a \u201cnatural born Citizen.\u201d For starters, put aside the word \u201cnatural.\u201d  Ask yourself whether Cruz is a \u201cborn Citizen.\u201d  In other words, was he a citizen on the day he was born?   Was he a citizen because of his birth, because of where and how and to whom he was born?    Note what the text does NOT say.  It does not say, Springsteen-like, that a president must be \u201cborn in the United States.\u201d  Yet it would have been so easy to say that, had that been the founders\u2019 legal meaning and the legal purpose! So the question is, was Ted Cruz born a citizen?  The Constitution says, in the 14th Amendment, that anyone born in the United States and subject to our laws is a U.S. citizen.  Today, that means everyone born on American soil except children of foreign diplomats \u2014 even children whose parents are not themselves U.S citizens.  Donald Trump, are you listening? Why January will be a cruel month in presidential race Unlike Barack Obama, who was born in Hawaii \u2014 again, please pay attention, Donald! \u2014 Cruz is not a citizen at birth because of where he was born.  Cruz was born in Canada.  But neither Article II nor the 14th Amendment says that only those born in the United States are birth citizens.  The 14th Amendment says that birth on American soil is sufficient to be a birth citizen.  But it is not necessary. How else can a person be a citizen at birth?  Simple. From the founding to the present, Congress has enacted laws   specifying that certain categories of foreign-born persons are citizens at birth.  The earliest statute, passed in 1790, explicitly called certain foreign-born children of U.S. citizens \u201cnatural born citizens.\u201d  It did not say they should be treated \u201cas if\u201d they were \u201cnatural born citizens.\u201d  It said they were in law deemed and declared to be \u201cnatural born citizens.\u201d   Congressional laws have changed over the years, but this 1790 law makes clear that from the beginning, Congress by law has the power to define the outer boundaries of birth-citizenship by conferring citizenship at birth to various persons born outside the United States. Can Trump paint Cruz as 'the other'? And here is the key point:  The statute on the books on the day Cruz was born made him a citizen on that day. The statute conferred birth-based American citizenship on any foreign-born baby who had at least one parent who was a U.S. citizen, so long as that parent had met certain conditions of extensive prior physical presence in the United States. The statute on the books on the day Cruz was born made him a citizen on that day. Akhil Reed Amar On the day of his birth, Cruz\u2019s mother was a U.S. citizen, even though his father was not; and his mother also apparently met the relevant rules of extensive prior physical presence. A critical aside:  Why would Barack Obama have been any different even if he had been born in Kenya, as has been preposterously but repeatedly claimed by Trump?  Like Cruz, Obama\u2019s mother was a U.S. citizen on the day of his birth, even though, like Cruz, his father was not.  And nothing in the relevant congressional statute treats a Kenyan birth as any different from a Canadian birth. The answer to this puzzle is that the congressional law on the books when Obama was born required a foreign-born child to have at least one citizen parent who had been physically present in the United States at least five years after age 14.  Obama\u2019s mother did not clear this bar, because she was only 18 when she gave birth.  So this birth had to happen in the United States to make her son a citizen at birth. Of course this birth did in actual fact happen in the United States, in the state of Hawaii, despite all Trump\u2019s malevolent mischief. OK, back to Cruz who was a citizen at birth.  He was born a citizen. He is a citizen because of the way he was born.  And all this is clear if we look at the relevant citizenship law that was on the books on the day of his birth.  Read it for yourself:  Act of June 27, 1952, 66 Stat. 235-36; Title III, ch. 1, section 301(a)(7).  (Note that Cruz\u2019s mother apparently met the requirement of the law to have lived in the United States at least five years after age 14; she was in her 30s when Cruz was born.) But what about that word I asked you to put aside for a moment \u2014 the word, \u201cnatural\u201d?  Does that word change the analysis? Cruz's law professor on birther issue: His own legal philosophy disqualifies him No.  That word confirms the analysis.  First, the word itself derives from Latin and French roots that are about birth.  The word is arguably redundant (in the way that much of language is).  In effect, the Constitution says that a president must be a \u201cbirth-born citizen.\u201d  But the word \u201cnatural\u201d does add a key clarification:  Congress is empowered by statute to define birthright citizenship under its Article I, section 8 power to pass a \u201cRule of Naturalization.\u201d Note the obvious linguistic link between \u201cnatural\u201d (Article II) and \u201cNaturalization\u201d (Article I).  Under this Article I Naturalization power (in tandem with Article II and with another sweeping clause at the end of Article I, section 8), Congress can define who is a citizen at birth, and can also allow persons who are not birth citizens \u2014 and thus not eligible to be president \u2014 to become citizens at some post-birth moment.  Henry Kissinger, Madeleine Albright, Arnold Schwarzenegger: None of these persons was born a citizen; none is eligible to be president; but all have become nonbirth citizens \u2014 naturalized as opposed to natural-born citizens \u2014 thanks to congressional naturalization statutes. So Congress has two powers under the Naturalization power: to define birth citizens, eligible for the presidency, and to allow other nonbirth citizens to become naturalized citizens, to treat them for most other (nonpresidential) purposes as if they had been born citizens. When the framers were drafting the Constitution, they were aware that the British Parliament had a long tradition of passing both types of naturalization laws, and the founders were specifically aware of laws that Parliament had passed conferring birthright status upon certain babies born to English parents outside England, babies referred to by these landmark statutes as \u201cnatural born.\u201d Note that the right question to ask is not:  What were the natural-born statutory rules in 1788 or 1790?  The right question is: What are the natural-born statutory rules on the day a given presidential candidate was born?  These statutory rules have changed over the years, and Article II builds these future changes into its elegant language. And a good thing, too, given that the rules of 1790 were rather sexist.  In both England and America, the law in that era typically focused on the status of a foreign-born baby\u2019s father, not mother. In other sections of the 1790 law, race tests were in place, treating \u201cwhite\u201d persons better than all others. Ironies abound.  Cruz is eligible, but thanks to modern \u2014 newfangled, nonsexist, nonracist \u2014 naturalization laws.  Had Cruz been born in 1790 to a noncitizen father it is not at all clear that he would have been eligible. And although he has managed to make this all about Cruz, the real person whose fundamental fitness for office is called into question by a careful constitutional examination of the natural born clause is none other than Donald Trump. Cruz is eligible, but thanks to modern\u2014newfangled, nonsexist, nonracist\u2014naturalization laws. Akhil Reed Amar Here\u2019s why.  Beyond the rules of formal eligibility, our next president surely needs to understand the Constitution \u2014 and Donald Trump does not.  He has repeatedly suggested that courts should decide this.  Wrong; the Constitution itself make voters and Congress the judges.  Trump has repeatedly suggested the issue is where someone is born.  Wrong again.  Many born outside the United States have been eligible from the beginning. Trump also denies the full citizenship of those who have in fact been born in the United States.  Wrong yet again.  Anyone born in the United States (except for the child of a foreign diplomat) is a full citizen under the clear words of the Constitution and very well settled Supreme Court case law.  Trump has also repeatedly and outrageously challenged the natural-born citizenship of President Obama in racially coded/dog-whistle ways that strongly suggest Trump scorns basic constitutional principles of racial equality. If you take the Constitution seriously, especially its rules about citizenship, you are welcome to vote for Cruz, but you should never vote for Trump.

            "article_content": "Melania Trump says she'd focus on fixing America's social media culture as first lady She gave a rare speech in Berwyn, Pennsylvania -- in the suburbs of Philadelphia Melania Trump says she\u2019d work to improve a social media culture that has gotten \u201ctoo mean and too tough\u201d \u2013 riddled with insults based on \u201clooks and intelligence\u201d \u2013 if she becomes first lady. But she didn\u2019t make any mention of the Twitter activities of her husband, Donald Trump, who has relentlessly attacked his political foes, journalists, critics and other entertainers for years with demeaning comments based on their appearances and intelligence. In a rare appearance on the campaign trail \u2013 and her first solo speech since the convention this summer \u2013 the wife of Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump discussed her vision for her role in the White House for the first time Thursday in suburban Philadelphia. \u201cIt is never OK when a 12-year-old girl or boy is mocked, bullied or attacked. It is terrible when it happens on the playground, and it is absolutely unacceptable when it is done by someone with no name hiding on the internet. We have to find a better way to talk to each other,\u201d Melania Trump said. Why North Carolina is so important in 2016 \u201cWe must find better ways to honor and support the basic goodness of our children, especially in social media,\u201d she said. \u201cIt will be one of the main focuses of my work, if I am privileged enough to become your first lady.\u201d Not mentioned: Her own husband\u2019s long history of cyberbullying. In September, after Clinton cited Trump\u2019s reference to 1996 Miss Universe Alicia Machado as \u201cMiss Piggy\u201d and \u201cMiss Housekeeper\u201d during their first presidential debate, Trump said in a 3 a.m. Twitter rant that Machado is \u201cdisgusting\u201d and a \u201ccon\u201d and directed followers to check out a non-existent Machado sex tape. Trump campaign manager Kellyanne Conway said Melania Trump\u2019s speech will not serve to highlight her husband\u2019s most controversial and inflammatory tweets. \u201cIt won\u2019t for responsible journalists who wish to cover her entire speech/life journey,\u201d Conway said, adding a shot at the Democratic nominee and the FBI investigation into her private email server. \u201cAnd under that premise, would President Hillary Clinton never be able to talk law enforcement or corruption investigations again? Would she just abolish the DOJ and FBI?\u201d It was Melania Trump\u2019s first speech since her appearance at the Republican National Convention, where her remarks triggered controversy because one section plagiarized Michelle Obama\u2019s 2008 Democratic National Committee speech. A speechwriter later apologized. She cast her husband as someone who\u2019s in touch with America\u2019s working class. \u201cEvery time my husband learned of a factory closing in Ohio or North Carolina or Pennsylvania, I could see him get very upset,\u201d she said as she made the case that the Republican nominee can fix the nation\u2019s economic woes. Trump opened the speech by discussing her youth in Slovenia before immigrating to the United States, saying that \u201cAmerica meant if you could dream it, you could become it.\u201d She said she went through a 10-year process of becoming a United States citizen, which she called \u201cthe greatest privilege in the world.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m an immigrant, and no one values the freedoms and opportunities of America more than me,\u201d she said. Melania Trump hasn\u2019t had a very public role on the campaign trail and has made it clear, publicly and privately, that her first priority is raising their 10-year-old son, Barron. But her speech Thursday was the first of what Donald Trump said in an interview with ABC would be two or three major speeches before the November 8 election. The speech took place in Berwyn, Pennsylvania \u2013 in the suburbs of Philadelphia \u2013 and was designed to help Trump win over the middle-class women in the region who could tip the balance of Pennsylvania\u2019s 20 electoral votes for Trump or Clinton. Conway worked with Melania Trump on the speech and was in attendance Thursday. Conway, Trump advisers said, has built a positive relationship with Melania over the course of the campaign. And Melania has privately been very supportive of Conway\u2019s role as the head of her husband\u2019s campaign. Melania Trump was introduced by Karen Pence, the wife of the Republican nominee\u2019s running mate Mike Pence. \u201cI know that America will fall in love with her just as much as she loves the American people,\u201d Karen Pence said.

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMA IS INTERVIEWED ON \u201cTHE AXE FILES\u201d FROM CNN & THE UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO INSTITUTE OF POLITICSPEAKERS:  PRESIDENT BARACK OBAMADAVID AXELROD, HOST AXELROD (voiceover):  I first met Barack Obama when he returned to Chicago from law school in the early \u201990s to run a voter registration drive.  And while I didn\u2019t realize at that moment where history would take him, I was taken by him, as someone who really cared about public service, was committed to devoting his life to it, and together, we had an incredible journey. Now, as the new year approaches, the days are ticking down on the Obama administration, and so I went by the White House to sit down with my old friend and reflect on the road he\u2019s traveled. AXELROD:  So Mr. President, I actually came over to help you pack. (LAUGHTER) But I really appreciate you dropping by.  This is a great surprise to be able to sit down with you.  You know, I was over at the Kennedy Center the other night\u2026 OBAMA:  Yeah. AXELROD:  \u2026 for the Kennedy Center Awards, and when you walked in, there was this thunderous and lengthy ovation and lots of tears.  And you know me, so you know that I was among those who were \u2013 who was tearing up.  But then I was thinking, what are you thinking?  And has \u2013 is it beginning to hit you that this is coming to an end? OBAMA:  Well, let me make a couple points.  Number one, you\u2019re the last guy I would have help me pack\u2026 (LAUGHTER) \u2026 because lets face it, orderliness is not\u2026 AXELROD:  I\u2019d also be the last guy to offer to help, so\u2026 (LAUGHTER) OBAMA:  So that\u2019s point number one.  Point number two, they were applauding Michelle\u2019s dress, which was spectacular, even by her own standards. (LAUGHTER) AXELROD:  OK.  You\u2019re not gonna get away with that. OBAMA:  I tell you, what has started to hit me is that the collection of unbelievable talent and vision and dedication in my team, the people I\u2019ve gathered around, some of whom have been with me for this entire ride, some of whom I got to know later, many of whom came of age in this job, so I\u2019ve seen them start in these really junior jobs and now they\u2019re running huge operations and married and their babies are crawling on the floor of the Oval Office\u2026 AXELROD:  Right. OBAMA:  It\u2019s a family, and\u2026 AXELROD:  All named Barack. (LAUGHTER) OBAMA:  So far, nobody\u2019s named their kid Barack.  I\u2019ve been a little upset about that. But knowing that that phase is coming to an end \u2013 they\u2019ll stay my friends for life.  Some of them, I\u2019ll collaborate with, like you, on various things in the future.  But to have them all in one place, to see how well they\u2019ve worked together and gelled, it has been just an enormous privilege, and so I have been getting more sentimental about that. We had our senior staff dinner, you remember these\u2026 AXELROD:  Yes. OBAMA:  \u2026 and I got\u2026 AXELROD:  Yes.  I heard you got a little verklempt. OBAMA:  Yeah, I got through about four minutes of the thing and then started, you know, getting the hanky out and\u2026 AXELROD:  Which you don\u2019t really do that much. OBAMA:  I \u2013 I \u2013 it\u2019s a\u2026 AXELROD:  You used to mock me for doing that. OBAMA:  Well, it\u2019s interesting.  There are two things that can get me teary.  One is talking about my daughters or seeing my daughters and the second is my team.  I mea,n you remember after 2012 when I went over to the campaign office and I saw all those kids who had been working so hard\u2026 AXELROD:  Yeah\u2026 OBAMA:  \u2026 and it was the same kind of emotion that stirs up this deep gratitude for their devotion and I think an appreciation that even though from their perspective, I\u2019m the one inspiring them, in fact all I\u2019m doing is drawing from their energy.  They\u2019re the ones inspiring me.  I\u2019m reflecting back what\u2019s inside of them, which is just a lot of goodness and a lot of heart and idealism.  And so that gets me choked up. AXELROD:  Well if \u2013 if they were here, what they would tell you is right back at you because you\u2019re the one who \u2013 I mean, everything has been organized around your energy and your sensibilities. And you know, we talked about this when you \u2013 when we talked about you running for president in 2006 and \u201907 and I said to you we haven\u2019t had a campaign that really spoke to the ideals of young people and aspirations for the future since Robert Kennedy.  And that campaign stirred people in a way that very few have, and we did that \u2013 you did that, and you know, only you could have done it.  And so\u2026 OBAMA:  Look, the point is, it feels like the band is breaking up a little bit.  And it really has been a team effort, it\u2019s been a really big band, a full orchestra. AXELROD:  Yes. OBAMA:  Horn section and all that.  And one of the things that I tell people I appreciate is that \u2013 that spark, that thing that we took a flyer on in 2007, 2008.  You know, it didn\u2019t always manifest itself in the day to day grind of governing, but the truth is it\u2019s \u2013 it never died out.  And I would continue to see it every day in what happened here in the West Wing and the East Wing and the White House.  The idealism and the dedication stayed with the staff and got us through some really hard times. And so, I do take a lot of pride in the fact that overall, this place never got cynical over the eight years.  There were times where we were aggravated.  There were times where we were frustrated.  There was gallows humor, but we \u2013 we never had that fire snuffed out and that is a point of pride for me because what that tells me is there\u2019s a whole generation of people who worked in this administration who are going to keep on doing stuff\u2026 AXELROD:  Yeah. OBAMA:  \u2026 in the future.  I don\u2019t think they come away from this feeling like government service doesn\u2019t work\u2026 AXELROD:  Well\u2026 OBAMA:  \u2026 politics is terrible. Click here to subscribe to The Axe Files. AXELROD:  The result of the election actually has stirred what I think is an encouraging reaction, which is this stuff matters, we can\u2019t walk away \u2013 we can\u2019t walk away from it. Let me take you back because what I was thinking about last night as I was thinking about this conversation was how remarkable your personal journey has been.  I \u2013 I sort of got to jump on the train and we \u2013 we had this trip together, but you know, when I think back to \u2013 I always love that story about after you lost your congressional race by what, the narrow margin of 30 points or something\u2026 (LAUGHTER) OBAMA:  That was a nail biter. AXELROD:  But you\u2026 OBAMA:  I think it was literally called like two minutes after the polls closed. AXELROD:  Yeah.  Well, that\u2019s good, you didn\u2019t have to waste the whole evening. OBAMA:  No, but I had to rush to get to the hotel to concede. (LAUGHTER) I thought I was going to have half an hour.  I had to put my tie on\u2026 AXELROD:  But \u2013 but tell the story about going to L.A. for the Democratic Convention and trying to rent a car. OBAMA:  Yeah, this is\u2026 AXELROD:  This was 16 years ago. OBAMA:  Yeah, this was 16 years ago.  So \u2013 so, I just got thumped in a congressional race and the truth is that it was a great experience for me.  It ended up being a building block for subsequent races.  It taught me a lot. But look, losing\u2019s never fun.  The one thing I always explain to people is although, I \u2013 I\u2019ve \u2013 I\u2019m proud that I have tried to conduct myself in office to do what I think is right rather than what is popular, I always tell people don\u2019t underestimate the public humiliation of losing in politics.  It\u2019s unlike what most people experience as adults, this sense of rejection. AXELROD:  Yeah. OBAMA:  And so, you\u2019re already a little mopey about things, and as you know, David, because we\u2019re close friends, Michelle was never that wild about me going into politics. AXELROD:  Right. OBAMA:  I\u2019ve got \u2013 I\u2019ve got two little kids, we\u2019re pretty broke, or at least at that point I had one little kid and one on the way.  And a friend of mine says, \u201cLook, you\u2019ve got to get back on the horse.  You\u2019re kind of down in the dumps.  Why don\u2019t you go to the Democratic National Convention in L.A.?  It\u2019ll cheer you up.  You\u2019ll be among folks who are excited about politics and you can stay with me.\u201d And I said OK.  You know, I\u2019ll go for the weekend.  I fly out there on whatever connecting flight that was the cheapest and get to the rent-a-car place and present my credit card and the credit card\u2019s rejected.  No more money.  So\u2026 AXELROD:  Aftermath of the campaign? OBAMA:  Right.  So I have to I think make a couple of calls to engineer somehow renting this car and I get to the hotel where my friend is ready to go and we go over to the convention and they give me the pass that is \u2013 basically only allows you to be in the halls, like the ring around the auditorium. (LAUGHTER) Didn\u2019t actually allow you to see anything, but you could wander around and\u2026 AXELROD:  This is four years before you gave the keynote speech\u2026 OBAMA:  This is \u2013 yes, and \u2013 and I think they\u2019d \u2013 my friend would try to get me into some of the after parties after the convention and bouncers would be standing there saying, \u201cWho\u2019s this guy?\u201d  And \u201cHe doesn\u2019t have the right credentials.\u201d AXELROD:  So, this probably didn\u2019t have the cheering up effect\u2026 OBAMA:  It didn\u2019t.  I \u2013 I felt as if I was a third wheel in this whole thing, so I ended up leaving early and\u2026 AXELROD:  At least (inaudible) the car. (LAUGHTER) OBAMA:  And I \u2013 and that was a stage when I was really questioning whether I should continue in politics. AXELROD:  Yeah.  I was going to mention that because I remember when you called me in 2002 to say you were thinking of running for the Senate and you said, you know, I\u2019ve talked to Michelle about this.  I\u2019ve got one race left in me, and if I don\u2019t win it\u2026 OBAMA:  Up or out. AXELROD:  \u2026 then I\u2019m going to go out and make a living and forget about this.  So that\u2019s how close you came to being out of politics. OBAMA:  Yeah, no, it was \u2013 it was an interesting moment.  And you know, since this is your podcast, I might as well give you a little credit.  I think, in our conversation, you were initially and sensibly skeptical about\u2026 AXELROD:  A black guy named\u2026 OBAMA:  A black guy\u2026 AXELROD:  \u2026 Barack Hussein Obama getting elected to the Senate.  Yeah, I was. OBAMA:  Yes, but you overcame your skepticism.  And \u2013 and I saw a possible path. The one thing that the congressional race had done is confirm in my mind two things.  Number one, even though in a predominately black district, I had been beaten badly by a well-established African American politician, it was interesting when I went out campaigning, people were actually pretty encouraging. What they\u2019d say is, you seem like a great young man and you\u2019re gonna do great things, it\u2019s just it\u2019s not your turn yet.  So what they told me was actually that I had strong support in the African American community, just not in this particular race. And the second thing, as you\u2019ll recall, in that congressional race, there was a chunk of the city, of the congressional district, Beverly Morgan Park, where there was a sizeable Irish population.  And I did really well there\u2026 AXELROD:  You did, yeah. OBAMA:  \u2026 and I connected well.  And it \u2013 it told me that in a big field, in the U.S. Senate race, that I might have a chance to win, so.  But \u2013 but it is\u2026 AXELROD:  If you had won that congressional race, we wouldn\u2019t be sitting in the Roosevelt Room right now. OBAMA:  No, we wouldn\u2019t.  So things \u2013 things work out. But \u2013 but I do always think about the fact that in the 2000 convention, I couldn\u2019t basically get in the hall \u2013 or I couldn\u2019t get into the \u2013 on the floor and nobody knew my name.  Four years later, I\u2019m doing the keynote speech.  And it wasn\u2019t as if I was so much smarter four years later than I had been in 2000, it speaks a little bit to the randomness of politics. And you know, part of the reasons that I think I\u2019ve stayed sane in what has been this remarkable journey, and you\u2019ve known me a long time and I think you\u2019d confirm that I\u2019m pretty much the same guy as I was when we started this thing.  Part of the reason\u2026 AXELROD:  A little grayer, but yeah. OBAMA:  Part of the reason \u2013 a little grayer, yes.  But part of the reason for that I think is because, you know, success came late to me, notoriety came late.  And it \u2013 it made me realize that to the extent that I had been successful, it wasn\u2019t about me.  It was about certain forces out there and \u2013 and me hitching my wagon to a broader spirit and a broader set of trends and a broader set of traditions. And so, when \u2013 when we came up with the phrase Yes, We Can, which again, to give you credit I was a little skeptical of, it felt a little simplistic when we first started.  But\u2026 AXELROD:  You didn\u2019t like the logo either, but that\u2019s \u2013 that\u2019s a different discussion\u2026 (CROSSTALK) OBAMA:  The logo I thought was a loser, it looked like the Pepsi logo and I thought\u2026 AXELROD:  That\u2019s what you said, that\u2019s\u2026 OBAMA:  \u2026 that seems a little\u2026 (CROSSTALK) AXELROD:  That\u2019s what you said, it became more iconic than the Apple insignia.  So \u2013 I\u2019m glad we straightened this out\u2026 OBAMA:  But look, I\u2026 AXELROD:  I\u2019ve gotten everything I wanted\u2026 (CROSSTALK) OBAMA:  That\u2019s what I figured. (LAUGHTER) OBAMA:  But \u2013 but what Yes, We Can described and I really meant was that this was not simply about me, that this was about us. AXELROD:  Yes.  And I think that was well understood and that was what was so energizing about it. So I want to ask you, you talk about your sanity.  I want to know why you\u2019re not nuts, OK?  And this is the reason, most politicians, you talked about how hard losing is. OBAMA:  Right. AXELROD:  Most politicians have some sort of wound, I find, especially at a higher level that something happened in their childhood and they really need the approbation of the crowds and the affirmation that comes with being elected. I don\u2019t know if you remember this conversation I had with you when you were \u2013 when you came to my office, right?  You got back from Hawaii, you\u2019re about to make the decision to run, you come in unannounced and we talked for a long time.  And I told you, I\u2019m not sure you\u2019re pathological enough to run for president. (LAUGHTER) And what I meant by that was I didn\u2019t think you had that sort of pathological need that so many people who run for president do.  And I don\u2019t know why that is because your dad abandoned you basically when you were two years old.  And your mom \u2013 I know she was very loving, but you were separated from her for long periods of time.  And if you were just looking at those facts, you\u2019d say yeah, this guy\u2019s gonna be a real needy person. OBAMA:  Yeah. AXELROD:  Why are you \u2013 why didn\u2019t you turn out that way? OBAMA:  Look, you know, you don\u2019t know \u2013 it\u2019s hard to get outside of yourself completely and evaluate all the factors that contribute to your character.  Some of it is just temperament.  Now that we\u2019ve been parents and you\u2019re a grandpa, you start noticing, there is an essence of each kid that barring really severe trauma expresses itself.  That\u2019s who they are. And so there is something in me, obviously, that is pretty calm and generally pretty happy and pretty buoyant.  But\u2026 AXELROD:  Did you feel \u2013 did you feel \u2013 I mean, this is a weird question to ask because you\u2019re president of the United States.  But did you feel loved as a kid, even though you\u2019re\u2026 OBAMA:  I did.  And\u2026 AXELROD:  And why, was it your grandparents? OBAMA:  No, my mom was \u2013 she was eccentric in many ways.  She was\u2026 AXELROD:  Kind of a hippie, right? OBAMA:  Yeah.  Yeah, but she always insisted on shaving her legs. (LAUGHTER) But she was \u2013 she was somebody who was \u2013 was hungry for adventure and skeptical of convention.  But she loved the heck out of her kids.  And both my sister and I\u2026 AXELROD:  That\u2019s what your sister says too.  I asked her this question. OBAMA:  For all \u2013 yeah, for all the ups and downs of our \u2013 our lives, there was never a moment where I didn\u2019t feel as if I was special, that \u2013 that I was not just this spectacular gift to the world.  And that\u2019s what you want your moms\u2026 AXELROD:  Yeah, of course, yeah. OBAMA:  \u2026 and your dads to \u2013 to give to your kids. AXELROD:  So even \u2013 even when you \u2013 when she was overseas and you were with your grandparents, she communicated with you (ph). OBAMA:  Yeah.  And \u2013 and I never doubted her \u2013 her love and commitment for me.  And she was so young when she had me.  I mean, she was \u2013 she was 18, right?  So in some ways, by the time I was 12, 13, she\u2019s interacting with me almost like a friend as well as a parent.  Now, there\u2026 AXELROD:  And you guys also weathered a lot together. OBAMA:  Yeah ,and I didn\u2019t always necessarily handle that well.  It\u2019s not sort of a recipe for ideal parenting.  But what I did learn was that unconditional love makes up for an awful lot, and I got that from her.  Now, a part of \u2013 a part of \u2013 going back to the question about politics, though\u2026 AXELROD:  You never feared losing. OBAMA:  I never\u2026 AXELROD:  You didn\u2019t like it\u2026 OBAMA:  No. AXELROD:  You\u2019re competitive. OBAMA:  I am. AXELROD:  I\u2019ve \u2013 I\u2019ve\u2026 OBAMA:  You know \u2013 you know what it was, David, and I think has remained true, is it\u2019s not that I didn\u2019t fear losing, it\u2019s that I feared more being dishonest or being a jerk or losing respect for myself.  I feared that more than losing. AXELROD:  So, subjugating those things that you felt were important in order to win? OBAMA:  Exactly.  The \u2013 the story I tell about myself didn\u2019t allow me to say oh, well let\u2019s trim my sails here for expediency.  And \u2013 and so, at the end of the day, I think that part of sustaining my sanity through this thing was having gone through enough growing up and community organizing and not being in the spotlight and having had this weird 15 minutes of success at Harvard and being president of the law review\u2026 AXELROD:  You were president of law review. OBAMA:  \u2026 but then going back into the state legislature where I\u2019m operating in obscurity. And those ups and downs meant that by the time I was elected to the Senate and suddenly, as you pointed out at the convention, shot out of a cannon into this unreal world, by that time I was pretty fully formed, had a pretty good sense of who I was, had a good sense of what was important and what wasn\u2019t. And look, I was also married to a woman who was not going to put up with any foolishness, and you know, Michelle, I can\u2019t underestimate the degree to which having a life partner who is so grounded and so strong and steady and fundamentally honest helped. AXELROD:  Sometimes brutally so. OBAMA:  Sometimes brutally so, but\u2026 AXELROD:  Yeah.  No, I \u2013 I\u2026 OBAMA:  But it \u2013 it \u2013 she has been ballast for our family. AXELROD:  Yeah. OBAMA:  And I \u2013 no doubt contributed to me feeling calm because here\u2019s what I knew about Michelle the same way I knew about my girls or my sister or my best friends.  Their relationships with me never depended on my success or outward success.  They didn\u2019t \u2013 my best friends from high school don\u2019t operate any differently with me now than they did when I was\u2026 AXELROD:  And they\u2019re around a lot.  You \u2013 you have them here a lot. OBAMA:  I do, yeah. AXELROD:  They don\u2019t call you Mr. President. OBAMA:  They do not. AXELROD:  Yeah. OBAMA:  Yeah.  That\u2019s \u2013 I mean, you know, I\u2019ve been lucky.  It\u2019s interesting.  As you get older, you figure out some things you\u2019re good at and some things you\u2019re not.  You have hopefully a better self assessment of yourself.  And one gift I do seem to have is getting really, really good friends around me who\u2019ve got my back.  And that gives you a certain serenity in the midst of a lot of foolishness. AXELROD:  We \u2013 you\u2019ve rebuilt the American economy from when we came here, and as a result, I have to take a word from our sponsor here. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) AXELROD:  One other element \u2013 one other element \u2013 I want to talk about the 2004 speech, which to me, is foundational for almost everything that came after.  But before I do, I just have one other question about your sort of makeup that I think is sort of central to your success and one mystery to me even though we\u2019ve been friends for like 25 years. What \u2013 how is it that you sort of just made the decision in the middle of your years in college that you were going to sort of transform yourself from a guy who enjoyed a party and was kind of a goof-off at Occidental College to kind of becoming an ascetic at Columbia with a much more purposeful view of \u2013 I mean, that\u2019s an unusual thing as well. OBAMA:  Yeah. AXELROD:  I mean, it\u2019s a disciplined\u2026 OBAMA:  Yeah.  Some of this, I think, is just a kid growing up and it turns out \u2013 and I see this in my own daughters.  People go at their own pace, right? So, I don\u2019t think that the more serious side of me sprang up overnight.  I think it had been building.  It just took longer to manifest in me than it might have in some other kids.  This may be an area where the lack of structure during my high school years because my mom wasn\u2019t always around, my grandparents, they\u2019re older, they\u2019re not as strict and paying attention.  I\u2019m sort of raising myself\u2026 AXELROD:  Right. OBAMA:  \u2026 meant\u2026 AXELROD:  Well, that \u2013 that\u2019s what strikes me. OBAMA:  Yeah, well what it meant was that \u2013 what \u2013 the kind of discipline that I see in my daughters developing at 15 or 16 took me until I was 20 or 21 because there wasn\u2019t somebody nagging me and giving me some perspective the way Michelle and I are able to give my daughters\u2026 AXELROD:  Was there one transformative event? OBAMA:  No, I don\u2019t think so.  It was just sort of gradual. The two other things that started happening that I think are relevant; one was I became more socially conscious at Occidental even though I was partying, anti-Apartheid movement, starting to be interested in social policy and poverty and starting to study civil rights even if through the haze of a hangover. (LAUGHTER) So \u2013 so, that starts giving me a sense of what a purposeful life might look like.  That becomes tied up with my racial identity.  I start thinking about what it means to be not just a man, but a black man in America and how do you forge dignity and respect in a society that\u2019s still troubled by \u2013 by the question of race.  And then, my father dies unexpectedly, but that doesn\u2019t happen until a little bit later. What does start happening is the awareness that I don\u2019t know him, and so I\u2019m not going to get that much direction from him but I start needing to understand better my genesis, where\u2019d I come from, all these things just made me brood a little bit more.  And so, physically I remove myself from my old life, I go to New York.  And it\u2019s true, I live like a monk for three or four years, take myself way too seriously.  There\u2019s this huge\u2026 (CROSSTALK) AXELROD:  That\u2019s part of being young, too. OBAMA:  Yeah, exactly.  Huge overcompensation, I\u2019m humorless, and you know, have one plate and one towel and, you know, and \u2013 and fasting on Sundays, and you know, friends start noticing that I\u2019m \u2013 I\u2019m begging off (ph) going out, you know, at night because I have to, you know, read, you know, Sartre (ph) or something. You know, so in retrospect, wildly pretentious.  And when I read back old journals from that time, because I\u2019m starting to write, or letters that I\u2019ve written to, you know, girls you\u2019re courting or something, they\u2019re impenetrable.  I mean, I don\u2019t \u2013 I don\u2019t understand what I\u2019m saying, right? (LAUGHTER) There\u2019s all kinds of references to (inaudible) and France penon (ph) and all this stuff and I\u2019m like what \u2013 what are you talking about? AXELROD:  But those are cool pick up lines, I bet. OBAMA:  They didn\u2019t work, I think, because people were all like wow, this guy is just too intense. (LAUGHTER) He needs to lighten up.  I should\u2019ve tried like, you know, wanna go to a movie or\u2026 AXELROD:  Yeah, those are good too. OBAMA:  \u2026 go on a picnic? AXELROD:  Or get a \u2013 or get a dog, that always works. OBAMA:  Exactly (ph). AXELROD:  So let me \u2013 let me return to 2004.  You made \u2013 you know, I remember when you wrote this speech, in fact when you got the call that you were gonna do it, you hung up the phone and you said I know what I wanna say.  And I said what do you wanna say?  You said, I wanna tell my story as part of the largest American story and you did. OBAMA:  Right. AXELROD:  And it was a very \u2013 it was just galvanic because people in a country that was riven heard a message about one American community in which we have different stories, but we have shared aspirations, values.  And you know, there is no black America, you know\u2026 OBAMA:  Right.  I remember. AXELROD:  You know, all of that, yeah you \u2013 you wrote it. OBAMA:  It was a pretty good speech. AXELROD:  So \u2013 it was a good speech.  And \u2013 and you went right out to the notion of a red America and a blue America.  So you know where I\u2019m going, here. OBAMA:  Yes, I do. (CROSSTALK) AXELROD:  How \u2013 how\u2026 (CROSSTALK) OBAMA:  How\u2019s that worked out for you? AXELROD:  Yeah, exactly. OBAMA:  The whole hope you change you (ph) thing? (LAUGHTER) AXELROD:  Exactly.  Where \u2013 I mean, you\u2019ve accomplished an enormous amount here. OBAMA:  Yeah. AXELROD:  And I\u2019m \u2013 you know, I mean, I\u2019m so proud of you. OBAMA:  Thanks. AXELROD:  But the \u2013 you know, the premise of our campaigns, both in 2004 and 2008, were that we could overcome these differences.  And what happened? OBAMA:  Well, look, a couple of things.  The \u2013 you\u2019re right about that speech, I knew what I was gonna write because essentially I had been off Broadway practicing during that Senate race, because I had been traveling through not just Chicago, but downstate Illinois. AXELROD:  These old factory towns, yeah. OBAMA:  Old factory towns, you know, you\u2019re in the quad cities, you\u2019re in Cairo, you\u2019re in, you know, places that, you know, people would\u2019ve assumed I couldn\u2019t connect.  But as I\u2019ve said before, it felt actually pretty familiar to me because they were my grandparent\u2019s culture in many ways. AXELROD:  Yeah, from Kansas. OBAMA:  From Kansas.  And so \u2013 so a lot of the lines of that speech in 2004 were really just a pulling together of what I had been feeling, what I had been seeing, the conversations I\u2019d been having. AXELROD:  And you told stories of people you met along the way. OBAMA:  Yeah, during the course of that couple of years.  And so we both anticipated that it was \u2013 would do well.  I don\u2019t think any of us anticipated the electric impact that it had\u2026 AXELROD:  I did about five minutes in.  I could see what was going on, there. OBAMA:  Yeah, but \u2013 but I \u2013 I always viewed that as an aspirational speech, not a perfect description of what is but a description of our best selves and who we might be, that the reality of our common cause and how it connected to our best traditions, starting with the Constitution through the fight for abolition, through the Civil Rights era, the Women\u2019s Movement. (CROSSTALK) OBAMA:  \u2026 for unionization.  And you know, the image of, you know, of \u2013 of melting pot army during World War II. AXELROD:  Right. OBAMA:  You got the Italian guy and you got the, you know, Polish guy and suddenly they\u2019re all becoming one unit fighting fascism, right?  There\u2019s always been a mythology around that.  There\u2019s always been an uglier set of impulses in America, exterminating Native Americans for their lands and slavery and Jim Crow and\u2026 (CROSSTALK) AXELROD:  And by the way, resistance to Doris Kearns Goodwin, who we both know and love, was \u2013 showed me a speech by Henry Cabot Lodge in 1896 castigating Irish immigrants and Polish immigrants\u2026 OBAMA:  Exactly. AXELROD:  \u2026 in the same terms that we\u2019ve heard in this last campaign. OBAMA:  Exactly.  So \u2013 so the point was not to bury that ugliness, but to say that there is this trajectory, the arc of the (inaudible) universe is long.  It ends towards justice.  It is a struggle, but there\u2019s this thing in us, there\u2019s this thing in this country that is good and unifies us.  And ultimately, will win out.  That was the speech. Now, I would argue that during the entire eight years that I\u2019ve been president, that spirit of America has still been there in all sorts of ways.  It manifests itself in communities all across the country.  We see it in this younger generation that is smarter, more tolerant, more innovative, more creative, more entrepreneurial, would not even think about, you know, discriminating somebody against for example because of their sexual orientation. You know, all those things that I describe, you\u2019re seeing in our society, particularly among 20-year-olds, 30-year-olds.  But\u2026 AXELROD:  But obviously, the\u2026 OBAMA:  But what I think we also saw is that the \u2013 the resistance to that vision of America, which has always been there, was always powerful, mobilized and asserted itself powerfully. Now, I would argue that in part, very cynically, somebody like a Mitch McConnell or Roger Ailes at Fox News I think specifically mobilized a backlash to this vision in order to accomplish pretty routine, commercial or power\u2026 (CROSSTALK) AXELROD:  Well, let me try something out on you (ph).  I mean, my sense is that McConnell, just as a clinical political matter, recognized the power of your message and figured out very quickly \u2013 and he\u2019s pretty much said this \u2013 that if we were to cooperate, it would\u2019ve meant that he had figured this out. OBAMA:  It would\u2019ve validated this vision and it would\u2019ve reinforced it and \u2013 and it would have, I think, consolidated itself for a generation or two.  And so Mitch McConnell\u2019s insight, which I\u2019ve \u2013 I\u2019ve said, just from a pure\u2026 AXELROD:  Yeah, right. OBAMA:  \u2026 tactical perspective, was pretty smart and well executed, the degree of discipline that he was able to impose on his caucus was impressive.  His insight was that we just have to say no to that.  And if we can just throw sand in the gears, then at a time of deep economic crisis, when people are really stressed, really worried, we\u2019re already stressed and worried before the crisis, now are thinking the \u2013 the bottom\u2019s falling out of their lives and their home prices are going down, their 401(k)s are evaporating, they\u2019re losing their jobs. That if we just say no, then that will puncture the balloon, that all this talk about hope and change and no red state and blue state is \u2013 is proven to be a mirage, a fantasy.  And if we can \u2013 if we can puncture that vision, then we have a chance to win back seats in the House and\u2026 AXELROD:  Which they did. OBAMA:  And \u2013 and win back seats in the Senate.  And \u2013 and so, I understand what happened politically. Two points I would make though, David, because obviously in the wake of the election and Trump winning, a lot of people have \u2013 have suggested that somehow, it really was a fantasy.  What I would argue is, is that the culture actually did shift, that the majority does buy into the notion of a one America that is tolerant and diverse and open and \u2013 and full of energy and dynamism. And \u2013 and the problem is, it doesn\u2019t always manifest itself in politics, right?  You know, I am confident in this vision because I\u2019m confident that if I \u2013 if I had run again and articulated it, I think I could\u2019ve mobilized a majority of the American people to rally behind it. I know that in conversations that I\u2019ve had with people around the country, even some people who disagreed with me, they would say the vision, the direction that you point towards is the right one. AXELROD:  We\u2019re gonna take another short break and we\u2019ll be right back with the president. (COMMERCIAL BREAK) AXELROD:  Well, (inaudible) Trump, as you know, Trump, Obama voters.  There were people \u2013 he won 200 counties that you \u2013 that you won and many of them are in these more rural or small town communities.  Did you think \u2013 you always had an overarching message and it had an economic component to it, a very heavy economic component to it.  Should this campaign have had that? OBAMA:  Look, you know, I think that Hillary Clinton performed wonderfully under really tough circumstances.  I\u2019ve said this publicly, I\u2019ll repeat it.  I think there was a double standard with her.  For whatever reason, there\u2019s been a longstanding difficulty in her relationship with the press that meant her flaws were wildly amplified relative to\u2026 (CROSSTALK) AXELROD:  But leaving that aside\u2026 OBAMA:  But \u2013 but \u2013 well, the reason I bring this up is because we\u2019ve both been in campaigns.  If you think you\u2019re winning, then you have a tendency, just like in sports, maybe to play it safer. And the economy has been improving.  There is a sense, obviously, that some communities have been left behind from the recovery and people feeling anxious about that.  But if she was looking at the campaign and saying OK, I\u2019m winning right now, and her economic agenda was in fact very progressive.  But\u2026 (CROSSTALK) OBAMA:  No, you\u2019re right, not well understood.  But understandably, I think she looked and said well, given my opponent and the things he\u2019s saying and what he\u2019s doing, we should focus on that. In retrospect, we can all be Monday morning quarterbacks.  Here\u2019s what I \u2013 here\u2019s what I would say prospectively, is that the Democratic agenda is better for all working people.  This division that\u2019s been put out there between white working class versus black working class or Latino working class \u2013 look, an agenda of raising minimum wage, rebuilding our infrastructure, you know\u2026 AXELROD:  Education. OBAMA:  Education, family leave, community colleges, making it easier for unions to organize, that\u2019s an agenda for working class Americans of all stripes.  And we have to talk about it and we have to be present in every community talking about it. See, I think the issue was less that Democrats have somehow abandoned the white working class, I think that\u2019s nonsense.  Look, the Affordable Care Act benefits a huge number of Trump voters.  There are a lot of folks in places like West Virginia or Kentucky who didn\u2019t vote for Hillary, didn\u2019t vote for me, but are being helped by this. AXELROD:  Right. OBAMA:  The \u2013 the problem is, is that we\u2019re not there on the ground communicating not only the dry policy aspects of this, but that we care about these communities, that we\u2019re bleeding for these communities\u2026 AXELROD:  Right. OBAMA:  \u2026 that we understand why they\u2019re frustrated.  There\u2019s a \u2013 there\u2019s a\u2026 AXELROD:  And the values behind these things. OBAMA:  And the values.  And there\u2019s an emotional connection, and part of what we have to do to rebuild is to be there and \u2013 and that means organizing, that means caring about state parties, it means caring about local races, state boards or school boards and city councils and state legislative races and not thinking that somehow, just a great set of progressive policies that we present to the New York Times editorial board will win the day.  And \u2013 and part of\u2026 AXELROD:  But some of that would fall on us.  I mean, I \u2013 take you and me because maybe we didn\u2019t spend as much time on that project while you were here.  I mean, we\u2019re trying to save the economy and doing these other things. OBAMA:  Well, yeah.  No, you know, I mean\u2026 AXELROD:  Our campaigns did it, but\u2026 OBAMA:  It\u2019s interesting.  You and I both, I think, would acknowledge that when we were campaigning, we could connect.  Once you got to the White House and you were busy governing, then\u2026 AXELROD:  Right. OBAMA:  \u2026 partly, you\u2019re just constrained by time, right?  You are then more subject to the filter.  And this is \u2013 you know, I brought up Fox News, but it was Rush Limbaugh and the NRA and there are all these mediators who are interpreting what we do, and if we\u2019re not actually out there like we are during campaigns, then folks in \u2013 in a lot of these communities, what they\u2019re hearing is Obama wants to take away my guns\u2026 AXELROD:  Right. OBAMA:  Obamacare\u2019s about transgender bathrooms and not my job, Obama is disrespecting my culture and is primarily concerned with coastal elites and minorities.  And so \u2013 so part of what I\u2019ve struggled with during my presidency and part of what I think I\u2019ll be thinking a lot about after my presidency is how do we work around all these filters? And it becomes more complicated now that you\u2019ve got social media, where people are getting news that reinforces their biases and \u2013 and separates people out instead of bringing them together.  It is going to be a challenge, but look, you look at what we did in rural communities, for example\u2026 AXELROD:  Yeah, yeah. OBAMA:  Just from a policy perspective\u2026 AXELROD:  Yeah, ask Tom Vilsack.  He feels very strongly\u2026 OBAMA:  Tom \u2013 Tom Vilsack, my agriculture secretary from Iowa.  We \u2013 we devoted more attention, more focus, put more resources into rural America than has \u2013 has been the case probably for the last two, three decades. AXELROD:  Right. OBAMA:  And \u2013 and it paid great dividends, but you just wouldn\u2019t know that, that\u2019s not something that you would see on the nightly news.  And so we\u2019ve got to figure out how do we show people and communicate in a way that is visceral and \u2013 and makes an emotional connection as opposed to just the facts\u2026 AXELROD:  I\u2026 OBAMA:  \u2026 because the facts are all in dispute these days. AXELROD:  I think \u2013 I personally think that part of the problem was sometimes, we become a slave to our own technology and politics.  And you say well, we\u2019ve got this group, this group and this group, and so we have the coalition we need to win.  And if you misuse that\u2026 (CROSSTALK) AXELROD:  \u2026 you send the message to everybody else\u2026 OBAMA:  This (ph) microtargeting. AXELROD:  \u2026 we don\u2019t really need you. OBAMA:  Well, part of what I\u2019ve been saying to \u2013 to people, and this was even when I thought we were gonna win, was that \u2013 that narrow Democratic coalition, the quote/unquote \u201cObama coalition,\u201d that if \u2013 if properly executed, yes you can probably win presidencies repeatedly.  It constitutes the majority of the country, but you can\u2019t govern. So part of the challenge for Democrats and progressives generally is that if we cannot compete in rural areas, in rural states, if we can\u2019t find some way to break through what is a complicated history in the south and start winning races there and winning back southern white voters without betraying our commitment to civil rights and diversity, if we can do those things, then we can win elections.  But we will see the same kinds of patterns that we saw during my presidency, a progressive president but a gridlocked Congress that can\u2019t move an agenda for us. AXELROD:  Just a couple more things.  Are you worried about the Corbynization (ph) of the Democratic Party?  Saw the Labor Party just sort of disintegrated in the face of their defeat and move so far left that it\u2019s, you know, in a very \u2013 in a very frail state.  And there is an impulse to respond to \u2013 to the power of Trump by, you know, being as edgy\u2026 OBAMA:  On the left. AXELROD:  \u2026 on the left. OBAMA:  I don\u2019t worry about that, partly because I think that the Democratic Party has stayed pretty grounded in fact and reality.  Trump emerged out of a decade, maybe two, in which the Republican Party, because it had to say no for tactical reasons, moved further and further and further away from what we would consider to be a \u2013 a basic consensus around things like climate change or how the economy works. And it started filling up with all kinds of conspiracy theorizing that became kind of common wisdom or conventional wisdom within the Republican Party base.  That hasn\u2019t happened in the Democratic Party.  I think people like the passion that Bernie brought, but Bernie Sanders is a pretty centrist politician relative to\u2026 AXELROD:  Corbyn. OBAMA:  Relative to Corbyn or relative to some of the Republicans. AXELROD:  Oh I see what you\u2019re saying\u2026 OBAMA:  And \u2013 and so \u2013 so I don\u2019t worry about that.  What I do worry about is that in an era where we are looking for simple solutions that \u2013 and want 1000 percent of what we want and when we want it, that we end up starting to shut ourselves off from different points of view, shutting down debate, becoming more dogmatic, becoming more brittle. And I don\u2019t see that being a successful strategy for us winning over the country.  Remember, we won the popular vote.  You know, we don\u2019t have very good population distribution from a Democratic perspective, right?  So I\u2019ve told the story about how I was in Brooklyn campaigning, I think for De Blasio, and this woman comes up, hugs me, how can we help you, we love you, I said move to Nebraska. (LAUGHTER) You know, I got a million\u2026 AXELROD:  She obviously didn\u2019t. OBAMA:  \u2026 wasted votes in \u2013 in Brooklyn. AXELROD:  Well, let me \u2013 let me before you go because you\u2019ve been real generous with your time, here.  What about you?  You know, I see this conflict coming down the line here, which is you \u2013 you once told me that you admired the Bushs for the way they\u2019ve handled their post-presidency in the sense that they gave you the room that you needed to do what you needed to do.  And I know you feel strongly about that. On the other hand, people are kind of looking to you now to be kind of the point of the spear in the resistance to this new administration and \u2013 and partly because of the absence of anybody else, but\u2026 OBAMA:  Well, I think \u2013 look, my \u2013 my intentions on January 21st is to sleep, take my wife on a nice vacation, and she has said it better be nice. (LAUGHTER) Because she\u2019s \u2013 she\u2019s earned it. AXELROD:  She deserves it. OBAMA:  She deserves it.  I\u2019m gonna start thinking about the first book I \u2013 I want to write.  We\u2019ve got to unpack, and \u2013 and I don\u2019t need your help on that either. (LAUGHTER) And \u2013 and look, I have to \u2013 I have to be quiet for a while.  I \u2013 I \u2013 and I don\u2019t mean politically, I mean internally.  I have to still myself and\u2026 AXELROD:  That\u2019s gonna take some time. OBAMA:  Yes. AXELROD:  It\u2019s hard to leave here\u2026 OBAMA:  It does. AXELROD:  I know in some small way what that\u2019s like. OBAMA:  Yeah.  So \u2013 so you just have to \u2013 you have to get back in tune with your center and \u2013 and process what\u2019s happened before you make a bunch of good decisions. With respect to my priorities when I leave, it is to build that next generation of leadership; organizers, journalists, politicians.  I see them in America, I see them around the world, 20-year-olds, 30-year-olds who are just full of talent, full of idealism.  And the question is how do we link them up?  How do we give them the tools for them to bring about progressive change?  And I want to use my presidential center as a mechanism for developing that next generation of talent. That\u2019s my long-term interest because I don\u2019t want to be the guy who\u2019s \u2013 you know, I joke I\u2019m like the old guy at the bar, you know, who\u2019s \u2013 who\u2019s just hanging around re-living old glories.  No, I \u2013 it\u2019s\u2026 AXELROD:  The good news is I think everybody will buy you drinks. (LAUGHTER) OBAMA:  It \u2013 it \u2013 I want to make sure that I\u2019m doing everything I can to \u2013 to amplify and lift up a next generation of voices not just in politics, but in civic life.  And I \u2013 I have the connections and I think credibility to \u2013 to be able to do that in some unique some ways. Short-term with respect to the Democratic Party, I think even before I leave here, what I can do is give people some sense of direction, and \u2013 and we already started talking about this.  I think what I can do is not do it myself, but say to those who are still in the game right now look, think about this, think about how you\u2019re organizing that, you know, what are you doing to make sure that young talent is out there in the field being supported.  You know, how are you making sure that your message is reaching everybody and not just those who have already been converted. Identifying really talented staff and organizers who are already out there and \u2013 and encouraging them to get involved. So I \u2013 I think over the next 45 days, what I can say is here\u2019s how I would do it if I were sticking around, but I\u2019m not sticking around.  I \u2013 by virtue of the Constitution and because I believe in the wisdom that George Washington showed, that at a certain point, you make room for \u2013 for new voices and fresh legs. Now, that doesn\u2019t mean that if a year from now or a year and a half from now or two years from now, there is an issue of such moment, such import, that \u2013 that isn\u2019t just a debate about a particular tax bill or, you know, a particular policy but goes to some foundational issues about our democracy that I might not weigh in.  You know, I\u2019m still a citizen and \u2013 and that carries with it duties and obligations. But \u2013 but the day-to-day scrum, that\u2019s not only \u2013 not only is it contrary to tradition for the ex-president to be involved in that, but I also think would inhibit the development of those new voices.  And I know they\u2019re out there; I\u2019ve seen them.  You know them too, it\u2019s just\u2026 AXELROD:  I do. OBAMA:  There\u2019s a little bit of a generation gap, you know?  The \u2013 in some ways, we\u2026 AXELROD:  There are some great leaders (inaudible). OBAMA:  Yeah, it\u2019s just that they\u2019re \u2013 they haven\u2019t quite gotten to prime age yet and what we want to do is maybe accelerate their presence on the \u2013 on the scene, and that\u2019s where I can be helpful, shine a spotlight on all the great work that\u2019s being done and all the wonderful young Americans who will help lead the way in the future. AXELROD:  Well, I would be remiss if I didn\u2019t tell you that I love you, man, and I\u2019m so\u2026 OBAMA:  Love you back, brother. AXELROD:  \u2026 so grateful.  I told you at the end of the 2012 campaign that you gave me the greatest gift because you helped renew my idealism. OBAMA:  Yeah, you were getting a little cynical. AXELROD:  Yeah.  And \u2013 and I \u2013 and I think you\u2019ve done that for a lot of people, and that\u2019s the greatest gift you can bestow.  So on behalf of all of us\u2026 OBAMA:  I appreciate that. AXELROD:  \u2026 I want to say thank you for your wonderful service. OBAMA:  It\u2019s been a pretty good ride. AXELROD:  Great ride. END",

Known as \u201celevator girl\u201d or \u201cTrump Tower girl,\u201d Madeleine Westerhout has appeared in the background of countless images and video from the lobby of President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s offices, escorting the transition\u2019s VIPs from the door and up the elevators. The polished brunette\u2019s face has been everywhere, from newspapers to websites to television, as she quietly whisks in the President-elect\u2019s guests. To the press pool gathered in the lobby, Westerhout appearing at the elevator bay is a sign that someone important is about to arrive, sending cameras into ready position. Her frequent appearances have been noticed by political onlookers, with even famous chef and \u201cTop Chef\u201d judge Tom Colicchio last month tweeting a screengrab of her from The New York Times\u2019 website asking: \u201cWho is this? She has greeted everyone at Trumps golf club and T Tower. No snark just wondering.\u201d Who is this? She has greeted everyone at Trumps golf club and T Tower. No snark just wondering. pic.twitter.com/otxbP0hno2 Westerhout is the assistant of Republican National Committee chief of staff Katie Walsh, the close adviser to incoming White House chief of staff Reince Priebus, and a senior adviser to the Trump transition. CNN caught up with Westerhout at Trump Tower for a chat about her newfound fame \u2013 and how she prepares her wardrobe. I\u2019ve been working for Katie Walsh for about three and a half years, I\u2019m her assistant. And we went up to New York after we won the election and we\u2019ve all just been helping out Reince and the team and doing what we can to make things work here.\u201d \u201cSo it started when we just began scheduling these meetings, and obviously, there\u2019s a lot of security outside, so Katie wanted me to make sure that these important people got inside the building and where they needed to be. And then the President-elect wanted to make sure all of his meetings were very transparent, so it became a little bit more public than I originally thought it was going to be.\u201d \u201cAll of the generals and admirals, like Gen. Mattis, Gen. John Kelly, Adm. Mike Rogers, they\u2019ve been really amazing.\u201d \u201cYes, all the time. My family loves it. I mean, they\u2019re so proud of me. So it\u2019s really fun to see them watching me and looking for pictures.\u201d \u201cI hope so. I love meeting these people, it\u2019s been a huge privilege, so we\u2019ll see what the President-elect has in store for all of us.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s right, yeah. (I) definitely have to plan my outfits in advance, and we\u2019re staying at a hotel in New York so I have to pack well in advance.\u201d \u201cDefinitely unexpected \u2013 I was not planning on any of this, but it\u2019s been really fun and it\u2019s an amazing experience we\u2019re all seeing, so it\u2019s fun.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s great \u2013 we\u2019re all working really well together. So it\u2019s fun; we\u2019re ready to get to the White House.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Rogers was an establishment national security voice on the transition team He was close to former transition leader Chris Christie, since replaced by Mike Pence Donald Trump\u2019s son-in-law and close adviser Jared Kushner is at the center of the \u201cinfighting\u201d inside President-elect Donald Trump\u2019s transition team, multiple sources tell CNN. Trump, however, tweeted Tuesday night that the process was \u201cvery organized.\u201d \u201cVery organized process taking place as I decide on Cabinet and many other positions. I am the only one who knows who the finalists are!\u201d he said. Very organized process taking place as I decide on Cabinet and many other positions. I am the only one who knows who the finalists are! Former Congressman Mike Rogers said Tuesday he parted ways with Trump\u2019s transition team, removing an establishment national security voice from the planning process of the next president\u2019s cabinet. Rogers was told Monday on the phone that he was out, according to a source familiar with the transition. The source said this was part of an effort to replace the transition team members associated with New Jersey Governor Chris Christie, who previously headed up the transition team\u2019s efforts until being replaced by Vice President-elect Mike Pence. \u201cSometimes in politics \u2026 there are people who are in and people who are out. And the people who have been asked to move on have some relationship with Chris Christie,\u201d Rogers told CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper Tuesday night. \u201cAnd so there\u2019s a whole series of about five of them that fit that criteria that were asked to leave in the last few days. And you know what? That\u2019s absolutely the campaign\u2019s prerogative. I hope they all stay engaged,\u201d he added. Kushner has been rubbing allies the wrong way in his recent efforts to purge the transition team of Christie associates, sources say. Kushner\u2019s father was prosecuted by then-US Attorney Christie in 2004 for tax evasion, witness tampering and illegal campaign contributions. Trump\u2019s team of bitter rivals Rogers, who had been working on the transition team for months under Christie, was sidelined as the campaign and transitions merged into one presidential team, with members of Trump\u2019s inner circle that were with him through the campaign taking more prominent roles in the transition, according to one source familiar with the transition activity. But another source, a longtime Christie associate, cautioned that there was no \u201cpurge\u201d of Christie staff, the team that began the transition months ago, and that such a characterization is \u201coverblown.\u201d While some Christie staff have left, others are continuing on with the transition team. A high-ranking Trump insider said the so-called \u201cpurge\u201d focused only on lobbyists. The Christie associate said it makes sense that Pence would want some of his own people involved now that he is running the effort. \u201cI think there is some confusion going on about a chain of command coming out of New York. Hopefully they\u2019ll get that settled pretty soon. I think they\u2019re going to need to do it because as this clock ticks, all of these decisions become more important,\u201d Rogers told Cooper. Earlier Tuesday, Rogers positively described his time period working with the transition team as a \u201cprivilege,\u201d in a statement to reporters, and said he was handing off his responsibilities as a national security adviser to the transition organization to Pence and \u201cthe stellar new leadership team.\u201d \u201cI look forward to continuing to provide advice and counsel as needed to the incoming Trump administration as they work to make America great again,\u201d Rogers said in the statement. Speaking to CNN\u2019s Jim Sciutto on \u201cThe Lead,\u201d Rogers said later Tuesday that he felt the transition team was \u201cgoing in a different direction,\u201d though he noted some confusion on the team. \u201cIs there a little confusion in New York? I think there is. I think this is growing pains,\u201d Rogers said. The news of Rogers\u2019 departure was first reported by Bloomberg. Rogers\u2019 participation in the transition team was seen as a heartening sign for traditional GOP national security advisers. Sources tied to the transition team talking to CNN described the organization\u2019s internal disagreements \u2013 mainly divided along the lines of establishment Republican operatives against more non-traditional influences on national security issues \u2013 as a \u201cknife fight\u201d on Monday. \u2018Knife fight\u2019 as Trump builds an unconventional national security cabinet Rogers chaired the House Intelligence Committee while he was in Congress and is an Army veteran and former FBI agent with an expertise in national security He has also been critical of Russia\u2019s role in recent hacking episodes, including the hacks of Democratic political groups during the election which the US government attributed to high levels of Russian government. Trump repeatedly declined to acknowledge Russia\u2019s role, saying the evidence was inconclusive. Amid the churn in Trump\u2019s transition team the Obama White House Tuesday night said it\u2019s moving forward with a broader sharing of information. \u201cWe received the MOU signed by Vice President-elect Pence this evening,\u201d said Brandi Hoffine, a White House spokesperson. \u201cThe next step is for the President-elect\u2019s transition team to provide us with the names of the individuals they have authorized to represent their transition effort across the government. Once we have received those names and related materials, those individuals will be able to receive the briefing materials we have prepared and begin to communicate with their Obama administration agency counterparts as we continue our work to facilitate the transition to the next administration.\u201d CNN\u2019s Tal Kopan contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Trump insists he can still win Much of the focus shifting to Capitol Hill The most dramatic and unpredictable presidential election in decades is suddenly slipping into a strange state of suspended animation. Donald Trump and his team, facing widening deficits in the polls, insist the Republican nominee can still win. But he and his allies seem to be increasingly contemplating the possibility of defeat. Hillary Clinton, meanwhile, is sizing up the challenges of a possible presidency at a time of deep polarization even as her aides say she\u2019s taking nothing for granted. Clinton looking past Trump to transition planning With just over two weeks remaining before Election Day, much of the drama is shifting to Capitol Hill, where anxious Republican leaders \u2013 estranged from their nominee \u2013 can do little more than fret about how bad it could get. Trump\u2019s stumbling campaign threatens to wipe out the GOP\u2019s majority in the Senate \u2013 and maybe even the House. Clinton will aim to build pressure on congressional Republicans Monday when she joins Sen. Elizabeth Warren in New Hampshire to slam GOP lawmakers for standing by Trump. Her clear target: Kelly Ayotte, one of the Senate\u2019s most vulnerable Republicans who has struggled to grapple with Trump\u2019s candidacy. Trump has been counted out before, so it\u2019s still too early to write him off. And voters \u2013 not polls and pundits \u2013 decide elections. But unless there is an abrupt Trump revival, another October surprise that could once again upend the race or a cataclysmic miss by the majority of pollsters, the Republican nominee seems to be on a glide path to defeat on November 8. A new ABC News national poll released Sunday had Clinton 12 points up on Trump, clinching the support of 50% of likely voters nationwide. CNN\u2019s Poll of Polls gives the Democratic nominee a nine-point edge. The mounting evidence seems to be fueling a realization in the Trump camp that he may be too far behind to catch up \u2014 with hundreds of thousands of ballots already cast in some early voting states. Several times in recent days, the billionaire has appeared to be laying the groundwork for a defeat \u2014 whether with his claims of a rigged election that could be a face-saver if he loses \u2014 or in wistful musings about the days ahead. \u201cI don\u2019t want to think back, if only I had done one more North Carolina rally maybe I would have won by 500 votes instead of losing it by 200 votes,\u201d Trump said Friday, while adding a caveat that he still thinks he will win. \u201cI never want to look back,\u201d he said. \u201cI never want to say that about myself.\u201d Final days of the 2016 campaign Trump occasionally seemed tired on the stump over the weekend \u2014 though sometimes took heart from his large crowds. He was also less prone to depart his teleprompter for ad libs that land him in trouble. In Newtown, Pennsylvania, on Friday night, the Republican nominee appeared to admit his campaign needed a significant boost. \u201cI\u2019ve wasted time, energy, and money \u2014 so you\u2019ve got to get out,\u201d he said. \u201cWe got to turn this thing around.\u201d And last Tuesday, Trump, a connoisseur of polls, said he had even lost faith in the few surveys that have him ahead. \u201cNow even though we\u2019re doing pretty good in the polls, I don\u2019t believe in the polls anymore,\u201d he said. Trump\u2019s campaign manager Kellyanne Conway admitted the campaign\u2019s struggling position Sunday, but was loathe to give Clinton any credit for her lead. \u201cWe are behind,\u201d Conway said on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d \u201cShe has tremendous advantages,\u201d Conway said of Clinton. \u201cShe has a former president, happens to be her husband, campaigning for her, the current president and first lady, vice president, all much more popular than she can hope to be.\u201d But if Trump is going down, he will do it his way. He\u2019s showing that he will continue to lash out, is happy to settle scores with GOP critics like House Speaker Paul Ryan while he still can, and will use the media spotlight to wage his own personal battles before the American people. On Sunday night, the GOP nominee, who has spent months laying into the establishment, pleaded with his supports to keep the House and Senate in Republican hands even as he groused that he would like the party to do more to boost his campaign. \u201cGo out and vote and that includes helping me reelect Republicans all over the place,\u201d Trump said in Naples, Florida. \u201cI hope they help me too! It\u2019d be nice if they help us too, right?\u201d But a day earlier, in the symbolic surroundings of Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, he made clear that the campaign that was all about him from the start will end with him in the spotlight \u2013 even if it\u2019s not in his best political interest. The event was billed as a chance for Trump to lay out a Contract With America-style agenda for his first 100 days as president in surroundings that resonate with a desire for national unity and reconciliation. Donald Trump's empire But Trump characteristically stole his own headlines, threatening to sue women who accused him of sexual assault after the election and lambasting the media for rigging the race against him. Latest Trump accuser says he hugged, kissed her without permission Once again, he detracted from the meat of his message, which included detailed proposals on new ethics reforms and labeling China a currency manipulator along with plans to spark economic and jobs growth and a tough strategy to crush ISIS. Speaking with Jake Tapper Sunday on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union,\u201d Conway declined to say if she knew that her boss would weave such a personally focused tirade into his Gettysburg speech. \u201cHe delivers his own speeches,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is his candidacy. He\u2019s the guy who is running for the White House. And he has the privilege to say what he wants.\u201d But Jane Hall, a professor of communications at American University, told CNN\u2019s \u201cReliable Sources\u201d  Sunday that Trump was being himself and displaying the indiscipline that has hurt his campaign. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t off message,\u201d she said. \u201cThat is his message.\u201d Increasingly, Trump supporters are forced to cherry pick polls that show their candidate competitive, or to place their faith in crowd sizes and enthusiasm on the trail, metrics that often seem attractive to lagging campaigns. Trump\u2019s son Eric, for instance, said Sunday on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week\u201d that he doesn\u2019t put much \u201ccredence\u201d in the ABC poll, denying he was in a \u201cbubble\u201d where Trump\u2019s support seems broader than it is. \u201cHe had 10,000 people in Cleveland,\u201d Trump said. \u201cYou know, Hillary and \u2013 and Tim Kaine, they were in Pennsylvania. They had 600 people in a gym. I mean the  enthusiasm levels are just totally \u2013 totally off the charts.\u201d Such thinking is not confined to Trump\u2019s family. Author JD Vance, author of a new book \u201cHillbilly Elegy\u201d on the working class white voters that form Trump\u2019s constituency, said the Republican nominee\u2019s supporters don\u2019t believe he is losing. \u201cI think a lot of folks think that the polls don\u2019t reflect reality,\u201d Vance said on CNN\u2019s \u201cSmerconish\u201d on Saturday. \u201cIf Trump loses, as the polls tell us he will, I do think a lot of folks are going to be very surprised.\u201d With the data looking ominous, other Trump supporters are looking for inspiration from voters in Britain, which voted to leave the European Union earlier this year in defiance of polls that suggested the opposite result. \u201cI do think there is a Brexit out there \u2026 I am almost positive there is a Brexit out there. I don\u2019t know how big it is, I think that remains to be seen,\u201d Andre Bauer, the former Republican Lieutenant Governor of South Carolina said on CNN on Thursday night. One veteran Republican said privately Saturday that there are some senior members of the party who still believe Trump can win. But the Republican added that many of those making Trump\u2019s case on television have already written him off. The US Chamber of Commerce, meanwhile, has already made its call. The key Republican interest group is throwing money behind an ad backing Ayotte in New Hampshire, telling voters they must send her back to Washington to act as a check on the White House \u2013 with the clear implication that Clinton will be president. Hillary Clinton's life in the spotlight Perhaps most galling to Trump, Clinton is signaling that she is looking past him \u2014 seeking a more positive, uplifting message as her campaign machinery gears up a formidable get-out-the-vote operation. She told reporters Saturday that she would no longer reply to his more controversial statements. \u201cI debated him for four and a half hours,\u201d she said. \u201cI don\u2019t even think about responding to him anymore.\u201d She added: \u201cI am going to let the American people decide about what he offers and what we offer.\u201d CNN\u2019s Jeff Zeleny reported on Sunday that Clinton had already reached out to some Republican senators, including allies from her days on Capitol Hill, saying she hopes to work with them to govern. And in another sign the campaign is looking to the future, her running mate, Tim Kaine, named Wayne Turnage as his transition director. Clinton\u2019s team is also looking at expanding the electoral map in search of a more decisive victory than polls suggest is on the cards, moving into Arizona and considering a run at Utah \u2013 states that are typically solid GOP territory. However, Clinton\u2019s campaign manager Robby Mook told CNN\u2019s Tapper on Sunday that no one is counting chickens. \u201cWe don\u2019t want to get ahead of skis here, so we\u2019re just as focused on Ohio, North Carolina, Florida, other states as we have ever been,\u201d Mook told Tapper. \u201cWe have a very clear message to our supporters: Let\u2019s double down, nose to the grindstone, and keep working.\u201d CNN\u2019s Ashley Killough, Dana Bash and Jeremy Diamond contributed to this report.",

She has some advantages,\u201d Kellyanne Conway said on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d adding that those advantages include that Clinton \u201chas a former president, happens to be her husband, campaigning for her; the current president and first lady, vice president \u2013 all much more popular than she can hope to be. And she\u2019s seen as the incumbent.\u201d Conway, while touting Trump\u2019s Gettysburg speech Saturday that proposed ethical reforms, also distanced herself from Trump\u2019s lengthy attack on women who have accused him of sexual misconduct. \u201cHe delivers his own speeches. This is his candidacy. He\u2019s the guy who\u2019s running for the White House, and he has the privilege to say what he wants,\u201d Conway told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper on \u201cState of the Union\u201d Sunday. \u201cThis lifetime ban on lobbying \u2013 if you\u2019ve worked in the White House, you can\u2019t lobby for foreign nations. That\u2019s sort of the big, ethical shower we\u2019re all going to need to take post-Hillary Clinton State Department,\u201d she said, touting portions of Trump\u2019s speech. Trump also proposed a series of reforms that include term limits of six years for House and Senate members. That would\u2019ve meant Trump running mate Mike Pence would\u2019ve been term-limited out of office halfway through his 12-year tenure representing Indiana. \u201cHe was definitely living in the swamp,\u201d Conway said of Pence, who led fiscal conservative fights like opposing the bank bailout pushed by his own party\u2019s President George W. Bush. \u201cMike Pence would agree with Donald Trump on that: When you\u2019re there for too long, you need that fresh blood and new perspective,\u201d Conway said. \u201cI wish there were more members like Mike Pence. If there were, we wouldn\u2019t need to have the conversation.\u201d Conway also attacked Clinton over her family foundation\u2019s acceptance of foreign contributions \u2013 but Tapper pointed out that those details are public because the Clinton Foundation has published lists of its donors, while Trump hasn\u2019t released his tax returns. Tapper said: \u201cWe have no idea what his ties are and where there might be moneyed interests and conflicts of interest because he won\u2019t disclose his tax returns.\u201d Trump says he\u2019ll sue sexual misconduct accusers Conway responded: \u201cHere\u2019s what we do know: We know that \u2013 as he said yesterday in Gettysburg, Jake \u2013 he used to be an insider. He\u2019s somebody who breathed rarefied air right up there with the Clintons and others, given his position, his power and his wealth and his great success as a businessman. And yet, that gives him the credibility and legitimacy to go and fight the system from the outside in. He knows how corrosive and corrupt it is.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Recent polls underscore concerns about the effectiveness of Clinton's strategy Clinton is still struggling to stitch together key parts of the Obama coalition Donald Trump\u2019s reversal on the \u201cbirther\u201d controversy is turning attention \u2013 at least for the moment \u2013 from a major shift in the presidential race. The battle for the White House \u2013 dominated by Hillary Clinton only weeks ago \u2013 is tightening dramatically, a nerve-wracking turn for Democrats that sets up what could be a nail-biter election in 52 days. A cascade of new polls this week suggest close contests in key states such as Virginia \u2013 the home of Clinton\u2019s running mate \u2013 and Michigan, where Democrats have won every cycle since 1992. Nationally in CNN\u2019s poll of polls, Clinton stands at 43% to Trump\u2019s 41%. In the must-win states of Florida and Ohio, Trump and Clinton are deadlocked in this week\u2019s CNN/ORC poll, as well as several other surveys. In Iowa \u2013 a state President Barack Obama won twice \u2013 Trump leapt to an 8-point lead among likely voters over Clinton in a Monmouth University poll released Thursday (his largest lead yet in a battleground state). And in Virginia, Clinton and Trump were virtually tied at 40% to 37%. Of course, the 2016 campaign has plenty of twists ahead that could once again reshape the race in an instant. The latest came Friday when Trump ended five years of pushing conspiracy theories about Obama\u2019s birthplace and finally acknowledged he was born in the United States. And the first presidential debate, which will likely be a pivotal moment for both campaigns, is nine days away. But the recent polls underscore concerns about the effectiveness of Clinton\u2019s strategy, which has centered on convincing voters Trump is unfit to be commander in chief, as well as her ability to lift vulnerable House and Senate Democrats in November with the same effectiveness as Obama in 2008 and 2012. The Democratic nominee is coming off one of the toughest weeks of her campaign, forced to the sidelines for three days to recover from pneumonia. Still, she returned to the campaign trail with a trip to the crucial swing state of North Carolina and insisted she is in a \u201cstrong position.\u201d \u201cWhat matters is who registers to vote, and who is motivated and mobilized to turn out to vote,\u201d she told reporters. \u201cAnd I\u2019m going to keep doing everything I can to deliver my message about what\u2019s at stake in this election.\u201d One of the most striking takeaways from the poll findings this week is that even with all of Trump\u2019s controversies and polarizing comments, Clinton is still struggling to stitch together key parts of the Obama coalition. That point was particularly evident in the new NBC/Wall Street Journal/Marist state polls this week that showed her with softer support from Latinos and young voters than Obama. Many young voters still have issues trusting Clinton, said John Della Volpe, director of polling at the Harvard Institute of Politics, and that is driving them to third-party candidates like Libertarian Gary Johnson, who is polling close at 7% to 8% in some states. \u201cThis (election) really, in some ways, is coming down to young voters,\u201d said Della Volpe. \u201cShe has not yet solidified what arguably should be one of the core constituencies of any Democratic campaign.\u201d Hillary Clinton's life in the spotlight It is with those voters where surrogates like Obama and Bernie Sanders will be so key to Clinton\u2019s efforts. First Lady Michelle Obama made her debut on the campaign trail Friday with a trip to George Mason University in Fairfax, Virginia, where she encouraged young people to show up to the polls in November. \u201cWhen I hear folks saying they\u2019re not inspired in this election, I disagree,\u201d Obama said. \u201cI am inspired because for eight years, I have had the privilege to see what it takes to do this job and here\u2019s what I know for sure. \u2026 Right now, we have an opportunity to elect one of the most qualified people who has ever endeavored to become president.\u201d Pence says he\u2019s getting \u2018whiff of desperation\u2019 from Democrats Clinton and her allies brushed off the week\u2019s new numbers as an expected development in what the Democratic candidate said was always going to be \u201ca tight race.\u201d Joel Benenson, Clinton\u2019s chief strategist, told CNN\u2019s Erin Burnett in an interview Thursday that the campaign was still \u201cplaying for 270 electoral votes.\u201d \u201cWe are still playing more offense in states around the country and keeping the Trump campaign on defense, particularly in states that are must-wins for them like Virginia and North Carolina,\u201d Benenson said. \u201cThey\u2019re not making us play defense anywhere.\u201d The improvement in Trump\u2019s standing comes several weeks after the real estate magnate shook up his campaign team and began delivering more disciplined, teleprompter-guided speeches. Several pollsters and strategists said Thursday that Trump\u2019s more measured behavior appears to be reassuring Republicans who were uneasy about voting for him \u2013 and had refused to commit until now. \u201cWhat\u2019s happened as much as anything else is that the election is taking on the contours of the 2012 election to a very large extent,\u201d said Democratic pollster Geoff Garin. \u201cThe ups and downs in the race have depended on the degree to which (Mitt) Romney voters from 2012 considered Trump to be acceptable or beyond the fringe. \u2026 Right now, what we are seeing in the polls is that more Romney voters are willing to go with Trump.\u201d Garin, an adviser to the pro-Clinton super PAC Priorities USA Action, suggested that, in the long run, there could be an advantage to Trump\u2019s calmer demeanor for his Democratic opponent. \u201cWhen Donald Trump is not behaving, he\u2019s sort of like a car crash that people can\u2019t help but stop and look at,\u201d Garin said. \u201cIf Trump is being less outrageous and less titillating, it means that Hillary Clinton has a better chance to get her own message through and have the election litigated on her own terms.\u201d Donald Trump's empire In a reflective speech Thursday, Clinton said her few days off the trail helped clarify what the 2016 campaign is about. Contrasting her style and tone with her rival\u2019s, she once again called Trump \u201ca loose cannon\u201d who would put America\u2019s gains at risk. Charting her course for the next few weeks, she said she would focus on working families and the challenges facing young people. In a nod to her vulnerabilities, she also acknowledged some of the criticisms of her public persona. \u201cI have been involved in politics one way or another for many years. It is not an easy business. It can get rough and I have built up some defenses,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen it comes to public service, I am better at the service part than the public part.\u201d But she said she was not \u201cthe showman\u201d that her opponent is and promised to \u201cdeliver for you and your family,\u201d which will be one of the cornerstones of her message in the final stretch of the campaign. The closeness of the polls clearly could mean more difficult races for down-ballot Democratic Senate and House candidates who are hoping Clinton\u2019s candidacy, and her well-organized operation, will give them a lift at the polls. In New Hampshire this week, for example, Republican Sen. Kelly Ayotte opened an 8-point lead over Democratic Gov. Maggie Hassan: 52% to 44% among likely voters in a new NBC/WSJ/Marist poll after earlier polls had showed a much closer race. As voters are paying more attention to the race, University of New Hampshire Survey Center Director Andy Smith said Clinton\u2019s vulnerabilities are coming into sharper focus and that is having a drag on the ticket. So much attention has been focused on Trump throughout the campaign, he said, that people paid less attention to how unpopular Clinton was. Donald Trump: I\u2019m \u2018the least racist person\u2019 \u201cThe candidate who has coattails is the candidate who is going to be able to pull in voters who might not otherwise have voted \u2013 and that\u2019s what Obama was able to do in 2008 and 2012, especially among younger voters, African-American voters and minority voters,\u201d Smith said. But this year, many of those young voters in New Hampshire voted for Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders in the primary, Smith noted. \u201cObama was able to pull them out in 2008, and to a lesser extent in 2012, and they voted for Democrats down the ticket, but they\u2019re much less likely to vote this time around with Clinton at the top of the ticket,\u201d he said. Some Democrats expect the Obama coalition to coalesce as Election Day draws closer. \u201cThere is clearly a gap for Clinton with younger voters that her campaign will pay attention to,\u201d said Bill Burton, a former adviser to Obama. \u201cBut once younger voters realize that anything but a vote for Clinton is a vote for Trump, the numbers will settle and the artificially high Gary Johnson numbers will come back to earth \u2026 The Obama coalition is lagging in getting behind Clinton, but the debates will help natural gravity set in and bring this race where it will end.\u201d Other Democrats see a bright side to a closer race at the top of the ticket in the sense that it could propel more voters to get out to the polls. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said Thursday that if Republicans want to believe that this race is tightening, \u201clet them believe that.\u201d \u201cBecause the more our own people see that it\u2019s important to vote, and a tight race sort of speaks to that urgency, then more of them will turn out. So it works to our advantage,\u201d Pelosi said. CNN\u2019s Dan Merica and Deirdre Walsh contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Corey Lewandowski is no longer Donald Trump's presidential campaign manager The departure comes at significant time for the presumptive Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump fired his controversial campaign manager Corey Lewandowski Monday, unleashing a major shake-up as he comes under pressure from his closest advisers \u2013 particularly his family members \u2013 to urgently reset his struggling presidential campaign. Lewandowski\u2019s abrupt departure is the campaign\u2019s most significant staff change to date and signals an acknowledgment from Trump that an overhaul is necessary ahead of the general election. Trump has suffered major setbacks since becoming the GOP\u2019s presumptive nominee last month, coming under intense criticism from party leaders, major donors and rank-and-file Republicans for an array of issues \u2013 including his response to the terrorist attack in Orlando that killed 49 people. \u201cThe Donald J. Trump Campaign for President, which has set a historic record in the Republican Primary having received almost 14 million votes, has today announced that Corey Lewandowski will no longer be working with the campaign,\u201d Trump spokeswoman Hope Hicks said in a statement Monday. \u201cThe campaign is grateful to Corey for his hard work and dedication and we wish him the best in the future.\u201d RELATED: GOP donors rattled by Trump The decision to fire Lewandowski was made swiftly in a Monday morning weekly meeting with Trump\u2019s family members, a Trump adviser said. In an interview with CNN\u2019s Dana Bash, Lewandowski \u2013 asked why he was fired \u2013 said: \u201cI don\u2019t know. I don\u2019t know the answer to that.\u201d Corey Lewandowski's full CNN interview with Dana Bash \u201cBut what I know is that what we\u2019ve been able to achieve in this election cycle was historic,\u201d Lewandowski said. \u201cI had a nice conversation with Mr. Trump and I said to him, \u2018It\u2019s been an honor and a privilege to be a part of this,\u2019 and I mean that from the bottom of my heart.\u201d Lewandowski consistently pushed back on widespread reporting that his presence in the Trump campaign had grown toxic, even as he acknowledged that he is a \u201cvery intense person,\u201d a perfectionist and a \u201cstraight shooter\u201d \u2013 sometimes to his own detriment. And even without a formal role with the campaign, Lewandowski said he would do whatever he could to help Trump win the White House. He was also notably unapologetic: \u201cI have no regrets as it comes to this campaign,\u201d he said. Trump, speaking to Fox News\u2019 Bill O\u2019Reilly, in an interview set to air Monday night, praised Lewandowski, saying he was \u201creally proud of him.\u201d \u201cHe did a great job. But we\u2019re gonna go little bit of a different route,\u201d he told O\u2019Reilly. Ivanka Trump, the candidate\u2019s daughter, played a pivotal role in convincing Trump to take action against Lewandowski. She had been critical of Lewandowski for months and this was not the first time that she had leaned on her father to part ways with his top aide. Contributing to Ivanka Trump\u2019s recent dissatisfaction with Lewandowski were intensifying tensions between Lewandowski and Ivanka Trump\u2019s husband, Jared Kushner, an influential force behind the scenes. One source said rumors swirled that Lewandowski had attempted to plant negative stories in the press about Kushner \u2013 a final straw for Ivanka Trump. RELATED: 5 key Corey Lewandowski moments By this point, Eric Trump, Ivanka Trump\u2019s brother, had already reached a breaking point with Lewandowski and expressed his frustrations about the campaign operations to his father, according to a senior campaign source. Donald Trump's empire It was ultimately Ivanka Trump who sat down with her father on Sunday and convinced him to let Lewandowski go \u2013 even offering an ultimatum of sorts about her own continued involvement with the campaign, according to sources with knowledge of this conversation. The development suggests that Kushner \u2013 who is already involved in building a transition team for Donald Trump should he win the White House in November \u2013 could play an increasingly prominent role in guiding the Trump campaign. But Lewandowski on Monday denied that there were tensions between himself and Trump\u2019s children, as well as Jared Kushner, telling Bash that he has a \u201cgreat relationship with the family.\u201d Lewandowski did not appear to know that the axe was about to drop: The firing was so sudden that he was on a call with Republican National Committee staffers Monday morning, just hours before his firing, according to one GOP source. Sources close to the campaign view Lewandowski\u2019s ouster as a major reset for Trump\u2019s campaign \u2013 as well as an explicit acknowledgment that things were not going well. Those closest to Trump worried that Lewandowski presented multiple problems for Trump. For one, they feared that Lewandowski was a hindrance to enlisting experienced, veteran strategists to join the campaign. There were also concerns that Lewandowski \u2013 with direct access to Trump\u2019s ear \u2013 would get the candidate agitated on issues that ultimately \u201cdid not matter\u201d to the campaign and feed some of Trump\u2019s misguided instincts, two sources said. Trump\u2019s inability \u2014 and apparent lack of interest \u2014 in toning down his rhetoric going into the general election season has deeply troubled the party. There is widespread concern that without a dramatic course change, Trump will continue to be significantly outmatched by presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton on many fronts, including organization, communications and fundraising. The news, which was first reported by The New York Times, comes amid deep internal tensions that have roiled the Trump campaign. Lewandowski was well known for being fiercely loyal to his boss \u2013 he is even a Trump delegate from New Hampshire \u2013 and also deeply protective of his direct access to the candidate. This dynamic created a series of problems as the Trump campaign began to hire staffers and expand its operations, including when Trump enlisted veteran GOP strategist Paul Manafort earlier this year. The internal drama \u2013 which Lewandowski dismissed during his interview with CNN on Monday \u2013 was viewed as a huge source of distraction at a time when Trump needed to devote all of his campaign\u2019s resources to preparing for November. With Lewandowski leading the campaign, Trump volleyed from one controversy to the next: unleashing attacks on Judge Gonzalo Curiel\u2019s Mexican heritage and suggesting that President Barack Obama perhaps played a role in the Orlando massacre. Lewandowski encouraged this behavior, rather than prodding the candidate back on message, one adviser said. Amid all of these distractions, members of the Trump family, his friends, as well as Manafort, had been upping their efforts to convince Trump that Lewandowski\u2019s guidance had grown harmful to the candidate and the campaign. Joining Trump\u2019s family in making the case against Lewandowski was RNC Chairman Reince Priebus, according to one source familiar with the decision. Priebus has been personally making the case to Trump since late last week that Lewandowski had to go. RELATED: Trump clarifies armed club-goer stance after NRA split Some advisers hope the latest move will allow the campaign to ramp up more quickly by building out a communications team, a rapid response effort and by ramping up their political machine in battleground states, an adviser said. \u201cThis has not been a campaign, it\u2019s been a concert tour,\u201d the adviser said, adding this could be the turning point for the campaign to get more serious. A second adviser added a note of caution though, saying if Trump isn\u2019t willing to behave in a more disciplined fashion, then Lewandowski\u2019s departure may do little good. \u201cI don\u2019t know if it helps Trump personally unless he is willing to completely change through the Manafort model,\u201d the adviser added. This marks the latest fallout in the power struggle between Lewandowski and Manafort \u2013 ultimately seen as a major victory for Manafort that could allow him to run the campaign in a more traditional sense. Some sources within the campaign are expecting Manafort and his deputy, Rick Gates, to fill the power void that Lewandowski leaves behind. The Trump campaign has started hiring what one source called \u201cmiddle level staffers with political experience\u201d in key battle ground states across the country, scheduled to start after the July convention. Despite the Trump campaign\u2019s efforts to create a more well-oiled machine, they are still not operating at full capacity due to internal feuding. RELATED: Anti-Trump delegate faction says it\u2019s raising cash, faces long odds \u201cNo one is really sure who is running things. It\u2019s very disorganized,\u201d said one GOP source working with the campaign. Most of the new hires have not begun their actual jobs yet, but are still in the process of filling out the enormous amount of paperwork \u2013 including disclosures and noncompetes that come with being employed by Trump, said one source. There are particular frustrations that the campaign has yet to hire a traditional communications team that can handle the high volume of media requests that comes with being a nominee for president, according to two sources in and around the campaign. Currently, the team consists of only Hope Hicks, Trump\u2019s spokeswoman. \u201cNo one is managing the message,\u201d one source close to the campaign told CNN. Last month, the campaign hired long-time consultant and operative Jim Murphy as political director, replacing Rick Wiley after clashes with Lewandowski and other original Trump hires led to Wiley\u2019s abrupt departure from the campaign. One of the top priorities with Murphy in place was building out the campaign\u2019s communications team, this person told CNN. In what was widely viewed as an incredible demonstration of the deep animosity towards Lewandowski from some factions of the campaign, one Trump adviser, Michael Caputo, tweeted this on Monday minutes after the news broke about Lewandowski: \u201cDing dong the witch is dead!\u201d Caputo later expressed \u201cregret\u201d for issuing the tweet and resigned his position as director of communications for caucus operations at the 2016 Republican convention.

Most people could beat Trump, because he\u2019s going to take himself out.\u201d Trump is viewed by many of the 3,000 leftists here as a potentially dangerous drain on the energy rallied by the success of Sanders\u2019 own insurgent bid \u2013 and an escape hatch for Clinton, who they fear will seek to channel anxiety over his ascent to muffle the movement\u2019s cri de coeur against the presumptive Democratic nominee. \u201cWhat we\u2019re offering is an affirmative program to really address the basic human needs in our society and to overcome this inequality,\u201d Michael Lighty, Nurses United\u2019s public policy director, told CNN before the event. \u201cAnd that is more challenging if everyone is just focused on defeating Trump.\u201d Sanders, in his address to supporters on Thursday night, also said \u201cdefeating Donald Trump cannot be our only goal.\u201d People for Bernie co-founder Winnie Wong, who helped organize the summit alongside the NNU, said she entered the weekend\u2019s meetings with a similar brief. \u201cThe subject, the goal of this, is to move beyond the frame of electoral politics,\u201d she said. \u201cNo one\u2019s even really thinking about Hillary, or Trump. They\u2019re thinking about the issues they want as a part of the Democratic Party platform and to make sure that they still have a stake in this journey.\u201d RELATED: Progressive activists say, Hillary who? But some other influential voices at the summit said they found it more difficult to look beyond November. Brooklyn-born Palestinian-American activist Linda Sarsour said dismissing the Trump candidacy was a matter of privilege \u2013 the kind she did not possess. \u201cBeing a Muslim in America, I don\u2019t have the luxury of saying, \u2018Let\u2019s see what happens when Trump gets in the White House,\u2019\u201d said Sarsour, who will be a Sanders delegate and platform committee member at next month\u2019s Democratic National Convention. \u201cSo I think that for people who are directly impacted, we look at things a lot differently. I don\u2019t see working against Trump as a distraction. I see working against Trump as one piece of the larger movement to build a political revolution.\u201d That piece, she added, had helped fuel her work \u2013 and would likely lead her to vote for Clinton in the general election. \u201cIf you\u2019re not going to vote for Hillary, you better be ready to defend my people when we\u2019re about to go into camps,\u201d she said. \u201cThe idea here is that we need people who are going to build local power and local resistance to whatever is going to come our way.\u201d RELATED: Trump says Sanders waiting for FBI to act on Clinton Frances Fox Piven, the revered octogenarian political scientist whose Saturday morning testament to the power of movement politics went viral \u2013 she received the news that her name was trending on Twitter with graceful puzzlement \u2013 also became one of the few high-profile speakers to announce she plans to back Clinton. In an interview later, Piven argued that Trump\u2019s proximity to power demanded a more pragmatic response and that his election could not be separated from the left\u2019s fortunes. \u201cI, like a lot of people, am afraid of Donald Trump,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m especially afraid of a coalition between Donald Trump and some of the big money people on the right, like the Koch brothers.\u201d Four or eight years of a Clinton administration, she added, \u201cwill give us time to build democratic, popular movements that will make a difference in American politics. Hillary is a politician through and through and she will be responsive to the pressures that can be created by the movements.\u201d",

            "article_content": "\"I will support the Republican nominee no matter who he or she is,\" Bush said Bush is focused on highlighting what he considers Rubio's lack of leadership skills Jeb Bush is sharpening his attacks against rival Marco Rubio in the final few days before the New Hampshire primary, raising questions about the Florida senator\u2019s position on abortion and characterizing him as an untested, political showman. In a wide-ranging interview Friday with CNN Special Correspondent Jamie Gangel, the former Florida governor talked about his campaign beyond New Hampshire, but also said he plans to support the Republican nominee \u2013 even if that\u2019s Donald Trump. \u201cI will support the Republican nominee no matter who he or she is,\u201d Bush said when asked about Trump. \u201cI\u2019ve done it my whole entire life. I\u2019ve signed a pledge to do it. I\u2019ll do it.\u201d Find your presidential match with the 2016 Candidate Matchmaker Late last year, after Bush began launching an aggressive attack strategy against Trump, the former governor\u2019s aides began looking into the possibility of Bush not backing Trump should he become the nominee. Lately, Bush tends to say definitively that Trump won\u2019t be the party\u2019s pick and avoids answering the hypothetical. But on Friday, he said he would support the eventual nominee, but stressed he doesn\u2019t think Trump would win in the general election. \u201cI want to win, though. I want the Republican Party\u2019s candidate to win. I want a conservative to serve in the White House,\u201d Bush said. \u201cI believe I\u2019m best qualified and that\u2019s why I\u2019m fighting for this.\u201d Barbara Bush: I'm sick of Donald Trump That pledge of party loyalty also extends to Rubio, he said, though Bush and his allies continue to train their fire on the first-term senator, whose third place finish in Iowa ignited a new round of momentum for his campaign. Since Iowa, where Bush placed sixth, Bush has been traveling across New Hampshire, diligently trying to compare Rubio and Sen. Ted Cruz to another first-term senator that ran for president eight years ago: Barack Obama. Bush said Friday that Rubio is \u201ccharismatic\u201d but not a \u201cleader.\u201d His campaign released a TV ad that included footage of former Sen. Rick Santorum, who ended his campaign this week and backed Rubio but failed to name an accomplishment of Rubio\u2019s in the Senate. Asked if Bush\u2019s attacks against Rubio will hurt the \u201cestablishment\u201d lane in the Republican race, as some critics have argued, Bush argued that politics is a contact sport. \u201cHe\u2019s attacking me,\u201d Bush said. \u201cSo does that count, or is this just only a one-way street? Is this the child of privilege that has a free pass, whenever everybody else has to fight for it? This isn\u2019t bean bag, you know. This is politics. Every campaign, every candidate will be contrasted and compared. Their records needs to be shown.\u201d New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie has also been going after Rubio this week, raising questions about Rubio\u2019s position on abortion. Rubio believes in exceptions to abortion only in cases where the mother\u2019s life is threatened, not for rape or incest. He has indicated, though, that as president he would sign legislation banning abortion if it had broader exceptions. Bush, who considers himself the most pro-life candidate, believes in all three exceptions. Asked if Rubio\u2019s position is too extreme, Bush said he \u201crespects\u201d it but thinks it won\u2019t resonate with large swaths of voters. \u201cPolitically, it\u2019s a tough sell to tell a pro-life mother \u2013 had her daughter been raped \u2013 that she would just have to accept that as a sad fact,\u201d he said. \u201cThis is not an easy decision, but Marco will have to explain that position.\u201d It\u2019s a slight departure from a few months ago when it was reported that the pro-Bush super PAC, Right to Rise USA, was considering plans to attack Rubio on abortion. Asked about it at the time, Bush simply showed signs that he disagreed with the reported strategy. \u201cI don\u2019t think anybody should attack someone who\u2019s pro life,\u201d Bush told reporters during a stop in Iowa last November. Mostly, Bush is focused on highlighting what he considers Rubio\u2019s lack of leadership skills. \u201cAs a speaker of the (Florida) House, he managed a staff of about 40 people,\u201d Bush said in the interview Friday. \u201cThat\u2019s different than running a, you know, state government, where you had 130,000 people that got reduced by 11%.\u201d He denied a New York Times report this week that said his campaign and that of Christie were secretly coordinating their attacks against Rubio. The two candidates have refrained from attacking each other and have both focused on the freshman senator. Bush said it wasn\u2019t true, but said he was glad he wasn\u2019t in a war of words with Christie. \u201cIf he\u2019s going after Marco, it means he\u2019s not going after me, which warms my heart because I\u2019ve been on the end of that pole \u2026 by Chris Christie, and he\u2019s pretty good at it,\u201d Bush said. Jeb Bush campaigns with his mom With just four days until voters head to the polls in New Hampshire, Bush maintained that he\u2019s not feeling any \u201cpressure\u201d and argued that he\u2019s optimistic about his changes. Bush supporter Sen. Lindsey Graham, however, told the New York Times that if Rubio \u201cbadly\u201d defeats Bush in New Hampshire, the former governor will be \u201ctoast.\u201d Bush brushed off the notion. Asked specifically if getting beat \u201cbadly\u201d looks like Rubio placing first or second and Bush coming in fourth or fifth \u2013 a possible scenario according to some recent polls \u2013 Bush flatly said \u201cNo.\u201d The candidate pledged to continue on to South Carolina, no matter the results. \u201cIf you want to come visit me from the next week after New Hampshire, I\u2019ll be in South Carolina. And the week after that I\u2019ll be in Nevada,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have a national campaign. This is the long haul.\u201d",

She is currently a Running Start Star Fellow in Congresswoman Elizabeth Esty\u2019s office. Star Fellows intern for a female member of Congress and receive political training and mentorship. The views expressed here are her own. Jazmin Vargas: The election outcome was a setback, but I want to run for office now more than ever It's hard to imagine how other women candidates will get as far as Hillary, she writes Before the 2016 Election, I was excited at the prospect of Hillary Clinton making history as our first woman President. She wasn\u2019t my first pick, initially, but I supported her in the primaries, and by the time the general election came along, I was fully behind her candidacy. When the election went the other way, I was deflated. Instead of excitement about women breaking another barrier, I felt disillusioned. At work on Capitol Hill the next day, there were just two of us watching Hillary\u2019s concession speech. I was tearing up a little when she spoke to young women like me about being proud to be our champion, when she told us we might break the presidential glass ceiling soon, and when she made sure little girls listening knew that they could pursue their dreams. In those moments, I truly recognized that because of Hillary and the other brave women who have run for President, women and girls have seen that they can run themselves and win the presidential nomination. I hope these examples inspire enough women to enter the 2020 primaries so that voters of any political persuasion can find a female candidate to support. However, it\u2019s hard to imagine how difficult it will be for women candidates to get as far as Hillary. That\u2019s why, after the election, I have a renewed passion to be part of that work. Instead of drowning in the devastated tweets I saw on November 9th, I am more encouraged than ever to run for office, because the fight\u2019s not over. I have to make public service central to my life\u2019s work and it must inform everything that I do. The world's most powerful women in politics Part of that devotion to service is my increased interest in running for office. The story of women in politics isn\u2019t just about whether or not one woman makes it to the top. The bigger picture is creating a movement of women who feel confident that they can lead and who know that their voices matter. Every woman who runs inches us closer and closer to equal representation and to our first woman President, and I want to be part of that. Even before the election, I was interested in political leadership. This past April, I attended a screening of Paving the Way, a film about Geraldine Ferraro\u2019s historic Vice-Presidential nomination hosted by Marie Wilson, the founder of the White House Project and creator of Take Our Daughters to Work. I had the privilege of meeting and speaking with Wilson, and I expressed my doubts about seeking elected office someday \u2013 especially since so few people in politics look like me, let alone share a similar background with me as a young Latina immigrant from a working-class family. She responded, \u201cIf more young women like you ran for office, then in the next 10 years, that could change. You can change the face of government.\u201d  With those words, she gave me a rush of confidence. She quelled my individual reservations and doubts by finding a network of women who believed in me and would invest in me as a leader. Kellyanne Conway, please talk to your boss That is what led me to Running Start. As a current Running Start/Walmart Star Fellow, I have the privilege of working for a woman in Congress and learning from political experts about how to run. What\u2019s been incredibly valuable is how the experience and training come with a network of peers and mentors that will one day propel me forward when I run for public office. In the near future, I hope to run for local office \u2013 city council or school board \u2013 in New Jersey. I know it is truly necessary to share my contributions not only as a woman, but also as a person committed to making this country a better place for all.  This difficult election cycle felt like a setback, but has ultimately become a new motivation. The weekend after Election Day, my parents asked me if I still wanted to run for office given what happened to Hillary, and I was quick to say, \u201cYes, definitely!\u201d I can move the needle and I will have the skills and network to make it happen.",

Issac Bailey: First lady, uplifting and stern, calmed a rhetorical war at first night of Democratic convention He says she's remained classy, taken the high road; showed with her delivery she's unwilling to play games Michelle Obama at the Democratic National Convention on Monday night was akin to Whitney Houston at Super Bowl XXV in 1991 singing the national anthem.  Houston\u2019s performance was a balm during a very real, yet far off war. Michelle Obama, for her part, calmed the tension in a brewing rhetorical war in Philadelphia. And only she could have done so. Her delivery was pitch perfect, her words uplifting and stern, all at once. She\u2019s the kind of speaker who gets it exactly right without seeming to try to. The speech worked. It worked particularly because it was Michelle Obama, a first lady who was pilloried by the right during the 2008 election cycle for expressing mixed emotions, shared by most African-Americans, about a country that made slaves build the White House and only allowed in families like hers \u2013 whose roots stretch to a plantation in South Carolina \u2013 to clean up the place.   Certainly not to represent the world\u2019s most powerful nation, even as it professed all were equal.

She was not born into wealth and privilege. \u201cHow we insist that the hateful language [our daughters] hear from public figures on TV does not represent the true spirit of this country. How we explain that when someone is cruel or acts like a bully, you don\u2019t stoop to their level. No, our motto is, \u2018When they go low, we go high.\u2019\u201d Join us on Facebook.com/CNNOpinion. It worked because Michelle Obama was there, and watched Hillary Clinton swallow her pride in 2008 and help Michelle\u2019s husband become President after a bruising, sometimes dishonorable campaign fight. It worked, frankly, because even the most animated Bernie Sanders supporters, who had been hooting and hollering all night, Monday night in Philadelphia knew there would have been a price to pay if they disrespected this particular first lady. They may have felt emboldened to boo through a prayer, shout \u201cLock her up\u201d at the mention of Hillary Clinton\u2019s name, as though they were in Cleveland, and even make noise during Elizabeth Warren\u2019s speech. Heck, they may even boo (a little) President Obama when he speaks later this week, because of his support for the Trans-Pacific Partnership, they are that committed to their cause. But Michelle Obama is as beloved by Democrats as Laura Bush was adored by Republicans. To have undermined her would have been worse than the political suicide Ted Cruz committed last week. Her speech worked because she understood the importance of the moment and easily rose to meet it. It is said that she has no designs on a future in politics. Maybe that\u2019s why she was so effortless on stage. Because she knew she had no reason to play games, so she didn\u2019t play any games at all. And the crowd knew it.",

He came within two months of his execution date when his sentence was reduced to life in prison because of a paperwork error. He was exonerated and walked free in 2014 after serving 39 years in prison \u2013 the longest sentence by an exoneree in U.S. history. He is a sought-after speaker and recently gave a TED Talk at the Metropolitan Museum of Art in NYC. Former death row inmate Ricky Jackson was exonerated after 39 years behind bars Jackson asked Hillary Clinton about her support for death penalty at town hall Sunday night He says that though he respects Clinton's point of view, he completely disagrees with it At the CNN Town Hall meeting between Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders last night, I had the privilege of asking Clinton how she could still support the death penalty in light of all the innocent people in this county in recent years who have been wrongfully convicted and sent to death row. I said last night that I was \u201csatisfied\u201d with Clinton\u2019s answer, but that does not mean I agree with her. While I respect her opinion and her honesty, I completely disagree with her position on the death penalty. The fact that we too often send innocent people to death row in this country can no longer be debated. I ought to know.  I was one of them. In 1975, I \u2013 along with my two childhood friends and co-defendants Wiley Bridgeman and Kwame Ajamu \u2013 was wrongfully convicted and sent to death row for the murder of a white businessman that occurred in our predominantly poor and black neighborhood in Cleveland.  We spent more than two years on death row before having our sentences reduced to life in prison. I came within two months of my execution date but was saved by a lucky technicality \u2013 the court made a mistake filling out the death penalty sentencing paperwork.  Bridgeman and Ajamu later escaped death only because the U.S. Supreme Court struck down Ohio\u2019s death penalty statute as unconstitutional. They both came even closer to death \u2013 one of them came within a week of his execution date. CNN's Ohio Democratic town hall in under 2 minutes If not for pure luck and chance, none of us would have been alive to see our exoneration nearly 40 years later. Because of an investigation by the Cleveland Scene newspaper and the Ohio Innocence Project at the University of Cincinnati College of Law, we were vindicated and gained our freedom in November 2014.  By that time, I had served 39 years in prison for a murder I didn\u2019t commit \u2013 the longest sentence by an innocent person in U.S. history. Hillary Clinton: I don't want to be a 'constant candidate' I know that the death penalty does not deter.  That can no longer be seriously debated. I also know that it is very expensive at a time when states are struggling financially and many are on the brink of bankruptcy.  As an expensive government program with no proven track record of effectiveness, it is, indeed, the proverbial \u201cbridge to nowhere.\u201d  But I also know that it sends innocent people to death row, and sometimes kills them. How do Sanders, Clinton plan to beat Donald Trump? Some of those likely innocents, such as Cameron Todd Willingham and Carlos DeLuna, have been executed at the hands of the government. Other innocent inmates \u2013 in fact more than 150 of them \u2013 have been lucky enough to have been exonerated and freed before their execution. 2015: Pope Francis calls for abolition of death penalty Furthermore, I learned from my time on death row that even the guilty are worthy of salvation. As an innocent and scared 18-year-old boy sent to death row, it was only the kindness and humanity of death row\u2019s guilty, who took me under their collective wing, that kept my sanity and maintained my faith in humanity.  These inmates made horrible mistakes, and deserved to be punished, but they are not the animals our criminal justice makes them out to be. A society should not be judged on how it treats its best, but rather on how it treats is lowest.  And even the lowest are capable of incredible acts of humanity and are worthy of decency.  They are worthy of God\u2019s grace, just as they bestowed grace upon me. O'Malley attacks Clinton over death penalty When I asked Clinton why she still supports the death penalty, she said she supported it only for the worst of the worst: those who committed acts of mass killing or terrorism.  I cannot accept that. In cases such as those, the societal pressure to convict is at its highest.  And when an intense pressure to convict is present, that is when the risk of convicting an innocent is greatest. The death penalty is also not a deterrent in terrorism cases. In fact, death can serve the purpose of many terrorists who wish to become \u201cmartyrs\u201d for their cause. Supreme Court Justice Breyer on the death penalty During all the decades I sat in prison as an innocent man, I saw societal views gradually change.  Not too many years ago, a Democratic candidate could not publicly support same-sex marriage and stand a chance of getting elected in a general election. Now, a Democratic candidate could not be taken seriously if he or she didn\u2019t support same-sex marriage. Likewise, no serious Democratic candidate should be able to support the death penalty.   We have evolved.  We have seen the evidence that the death penalty doesn\u2019t work and that it kills the innocent. Lethal injection at the Supreme Court in two minutes Given this evidence, it is time that no candidate \u2013 Democrat or Republican \u2013 should be taken seriously if he or she supports capital punishment. The fact that Clinton continues to hang on to this antiquated relic confuses me.  She touts \u201ccriminal justice reform\u201d \u2013 and much reform is needed \u2013 but she misses one of the lowest hanging pieces of fruit. I said last night that I am an \u201cundecided\u201d voter.  I hope that Clinton reconsiders her position on capital punishment before I do what I have been waiting my entire life to do: cast my first presidential vote as a free and vindicated man.

President-elect Donald Trump wasn\u2019t specifically mentioned in his church address, but Cuomo has in the past criticized Trump and vowed in a New York Daily News op-ed that he would \u201creject the hateful attitudes that pervaded throughout the 2016 campaign.\u201d The Southern Poverty Law Center has counted more than 700 incidents of hateful harassment and intimidation since the election. A toll-free hot line that Cuomo launched on November 15 to connect New Yorkers with the state Division of Human Rights to report incidents of bias and discrimination has received more than 400 calls since Friday, according to Cuomo\u2019s office. 'Make America White Again': Hate speech and crimes post-election Calling this kind of prejudice a \u201csocial poison [in] the fabric of our nation,\u201d the governor cited a number of recent incidents, including a scourge of swastika graffiti and the case of black freshmen at the University of Pennsylvania being sent pictures of lynchings and racial slurs. Cuomo also vowed to set up a legal defense fund for immigrants who fear prosecution under a Trump administration. He said the fund would be the first of its kind. The plan, he said, would be to set up a public-private partnership \u201cto provide immigrants who can\u2019t afford their own defense the legal assistance they need \u2026 because in New York, we believe in justice for all,\u201d Cuomo said. He added, \u201cIf there is a move to deport immigrants then I say start with me. I am a son of immigrants. Son of Mario Cuomo, who is the son of Andrea Cuomo, a poor Italian immigrant who came to this country without a job, without money, or resources and he was here only for the promise of America.\u201d Cuomo\u2019s plans also include the expansion of New York\u2019s Human Rights Law to protect students who are bullied or discriminated against. We don't care the color of your skin or how much money you have in your pocket - if you accept the American ideal, we will work with you. New York Police Department Commissioner James O\u2019Neill told a New York radio station on Sunday he was disturbed by the trends. \u201cWe\u2019ve had an uptick in hate crimes, actually a little bit more than an uptick. We\u2019re up 31% from last year. We had at this time last year 250, this year we have 328, specifically against the Muslim population in New York City \u2013 we went up from 12 to 25, and anti-Semitic is up, too, by 9% from 102 to 111,\u201d O\u2019Neill said. \u201cI have no scientific evidence as to why, but you\u2019ve been paying attention to what\u2019s been going on in the country over the last year or so and the rhetoric has increased, and I think that might have something to do with it,\u201d O\u2019Neill added. Cuomo said on Sunday that New York\u2019s tolerance will lead the way for the rest of the nation, and his announcement came as an \u201canti-hate\u201d rally was held in a Brooklyn park vandalized with swastikas and pro-Trump graffiti. The rally, at a playground named after the late Beastie Boy Adam Yauch, was attended by band member Adam Horovitz, better known as Ad-Rock. A post shared by Lisa Nagy Isaacson (@teeteeinthecity) \u201cKeep your eyes open, stand up for each other. This is homegrown terrorism for real,\u201d Horovitz told the crowd. \u201cI reject Donald Trump\u2019s vision for America. New York City, I\u2019m asking you to do the same.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Author\u2019s note: \u201cWhitelash is a new word coined by CNN commentator Van Jones to describe, in part, why he felt Americans elected Donald Trump as president. But the term describes an old reality: Dramatic racial progress in America is inevitably followed by a white backlash, or \u201cwhitelash.\u201d Reconstruction in the 19th century was followed by a century of Jim Crow. The civil rights movement of the 1950s and \u201960s was followed by President Ronald Reagan and the rise of the religious right. Four years ago, on the eve of President Barack Obama\u2019s re-election, I warned that his presidency could spark such a backlash. In my November 1, 2012, story headlined, \u201cParallels to country\u2019s racist past haunt age of Obama\u201d \u2013 reprinted in full below \u2013 I examined another time when white Americans nostalgic for an old social order transformed the country. This is what happened \u2013 and could happen again in the years ahead. (CNN) \u2013 A tall, caramel-complexioned man marched across the steps of the U.S. Capitol to be sworn into office as a jubilant crowd watched history being made. The man was an African-American of mixed-race heritage, an eloquent speaker whose election was hailed as a reminder of how far America had come. But the man who placed his hand on the Bible that winter day in Washington wasn\u2019t Barack Obama. He was Hiram Rhodes Revels, the first African-American elected to the U.S. Senate. His election and that of many other African-Americans to public office triggered a white backlash that helped destroy Reconstruction, America\u2019s first attempt to build an interracial democracy in the wake of the Civil War. To some historians, Revels\u2019 story offers sobering lessons for our time: that this year\u2019s presidential election is about the past as well as the future. These historians say Obama isn\u2019t a post-racial president but a \u201cpost-Reconstructionist\u201d leader. They say his presidency has sparked a white backlash with parallels to a brutal period in U.S. history that began with dramatic racial progress. Some of the biggest controversies of the 2012 contest could have been ripped from the headlines of that late 19th-century era, they say: Debates erupt over voting rights restrictions and racial preferences, a new federal health care act divides the country, an economic crisis sparks a small government movement. And then there\u2019s a vocal minority accusing a national black political leader of not being a \u201clegitimate\u201d U.S. citizen. All were major issues during Reconstruction, an attempt to bring the former Confederate states back into the national fold and create a new era of racial justice. And many of the same forces that destroyed Reconstruction may be converging again, some scholars and historians say. Ruha Benjamin points to this as proof that change is fragile \u2013 and reversible. The backlash that swept aside Revels lasted nearly a century. \u201cWhen white Americans helped put this African-American in the Senate, it seemed that they were really welcoming African-Americans and they wanted them to have full equality,\u201d said Benjamin, an African-American studies professor at Boston University. \u201cWe know in hindsight that it was about to get worse.\u201d The notion that the country is poised to enter a new post-Reconstruction era may seem outlandish, even offensive. That period, known as the Jim Crow era, saw the establishment of American apartheid: segregated public facilities, race riots and white racists murdering blacks and their white allies with impunity. Today, too many white Americans are \u201cmilitantly anti-racist\u201d for the country to return to the post-Reconstruction era, said Mark D. Naison, a history professor at Fordham University in New York City. \u201cYou hold a racist demonstration in this country and the anti-racist protesters will have as many whites and blacks in their group, maybe more,\u201d Naison said. \u201cWe are definitely not post-racial, but we aren\u2019t going back to the days of legal segregation.\u201d Yet there is another slice of white America that seems stuck in a time warp, as if it never left the post-Reconstruction era, other historians argue. While not calling for the return of Jim Crow segregation, some white Americans are recycling the same political rhetoric and legal strategies that snuffed out Reconstruction, these historians say. They are also resurrecting some of the most racist images from the post-Reconstruction era, some black commentators say. While it is no longer acceptable to call a black person the N-word publicly, people do it all the time in social media, video games and in the comment sections of online news stories, said Nsenga Burton, a writer for The Root, an online news site with an African-American perspective. Much of this racism is aimed at Obama, she says. Among examples, he\u2019s been called \u201ctar baby\u201d and \u201cthe ultimate Affirmative Action N******\u201d and depicted as a chimp. People are not shocked anymore by overt displays of racism, she says. Burton said in a Root essay entitled, \u201cIt\u2019s a Great Time to be a Racist,\u201d that Obama\u2019s presidency didn\u2019t inaugurate a post-racial era. \u201cTry post-Reconstruction,\u201d she said, \u201cbecause the harmful slurs and images being tossed around the public space hark back more to a racist past than to a racially ambiguous future.\u201d A recent Associated Press online poll concluded that racial prejudice in America has slightly increased since Obama\u2019s election. The survey said that a majority of Americans, 51%, express explicit racial prejudice toward blacks, compared to 48% in 2008. While the poll on its own doesn\u2019t prove the country has become more racist in the last four years, it does offer evidence that the \u201cpost-racial\u201d world some thought Obama\u2019s inauguration would bring has yet to materialize. \u201cWe\u2019re in a racist renaissance,\u201d Burton said. \u201cIt\u2019s a rebirth of the oldest forms of racism. It\u2019s not new, not different. It\u2019s like the 1800s, the most archaic abusive terms are applied to black people every single day.\u201d Some conservatives have a different take, on history as well as current events. Everyone who criticizes the president is labeled a racist, they say. And describing Obama as a post-Reconstruction president is absurd. \u201cIt\u2019s race-baiting of the highest order; it\u2019s bunk,\u201d said Niger Innis, a black conservative and son of civil rights activist Roy Innis who has defended the Tea Party movement against accusations of racism. \u201cThe America of today is not the America of the 1870s,\u201d Innis said. \u201cWhen the American people voted for their first black president, the Union Army didn\u2019t occupy the country.\u201d Some conservative commentators also say Obama isn\u2019t a victim of racism, but to the contrary has inflamed racial divisions to advance his political agenda. \u201cObama was falsely portrayed in his campaign as a post-racial president who would bring healing to the nation\u2019s racial divisions,\u201d said Larry Schweikart, co-author of \u201cA Patriot\u2019s History of the United States.\u201d \u201cObama has done everything he can to ensure that there were stark racial differences. \u2026 Obama has focused his entire administration around racism, a sort of reverse racism on his end,\u201d Schweikart claimed. It is a view that has been reflected by conservative talk-show hosts such as Glenn Beck and Rush Limbaugh\u2019s brother David, author of \u201cThe Great Destroyer.\u201d David Limbaugh would not talk to CNN for this story. Reconstruction, which lasted from the end of the Civil War in 1865 to 1877, was filled with dueling perceptions of race as well. The political changes unleashed by the Civil War unnerved many white Southerners: As blacks achieved positions of power that previously had been reserved for whites, historians say, many whites felt like their country didn\u2019t belong to them anymore. After the Civil War, the U.S. Congress passed the 13th, 14th and 15th \u201cReconstruction Amendments\u201d that abolished slavery, granted citizenship rights to blacks and prohibited denying the right to vote to newly freed slaves. The term \u201ccivil rights\u201d was coined during Reconstruction, said Eric Foner, the Pulitzer Prize-winning author of \u201cReconstruction: America\u2019s Unfinished Revolution.\u201d A century before Rosa Parks refused to move to the back of a segregated bus, Congress passed the 1866 and 1875 Civil Rights Acts, which banned the discrimination of blacks in \u201cpublic accommodations\u201d such as streetcars and theaters. The reforms provoked what some historians say was white Southerners\u2019 greatest fear: \u201cNegro Rule.\u201d During Reconstruction, at least 2,000 blacks were eventually elected to political offices throughout the South. They included congressmen, judges, tax collectors, sheriffs, even a governor, said Philip Dray, author of \u201cCapitol Men,\u201d which examines Reconstruction through the lives of the first black congressmen. \u201cExpectations were high,\u201d said Dray, who has also written books about the rise of labor unions and lynchings in America. \u201cPeople felt like there was change, and they were going to be part of it.\u201d Revels rode that wave of optimism into high office. In 1870, he became the first African-American elected to the U.S. Senate when the Mississippi legislature appointed him to fill a vacancy left when the state seceded from the Union. Opponents initially insisted he wasn\u2019t a legitimate U.S. citizen because the Constitution required a senator be a citizen for at least nine years. He also had an unusual background, having been born to a free black family in North Carolina when slavery was legal. \u201cHe wasn\u2019t radical or over the top,\u201d Dray said of Revels. \u201cHe was a minister, a conciliatory figure. The idea was that it would be easier for him to weather the scrutiny.\u201d Revels himself would anticipate the white backlash that would follow when he told the Senate early in 1871: \u201cI find that the prejudice in this country to color is very great, and I sometimes fear that it is on the increase.\u201d Beyond Revels, there are other parallels between today and the post-Reconstruction era, according to some historians. The most commonly cited link revolves around the debate over voter ID laws. Since Obama\u2019s election, 34 states have considered adopting legislation requiring photo ID for voters, according to the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University. Seven have passed such laws, which typically require voters to present a government-issued photo ID at the polls. During the post-Reconstruction era, many white Southerners viewed the onset of black voting power in apocalyptic terms. They created a thicket of voting barriers \u2013 \u201cpoll taxes,\u201d \u201cliteracy tests\u201d and \u201cunderstanding clauses\u201d \u2013 to prevent blacks from voting, said Dray. \u201cThe idea was to invalidate the black vote without directly challenging the 15th Amendment,\u201d Dray said. Many contemporary voter ID laws are following the same script, he said. \u201cIt just goes on and on. They\u2019ve never completely gone away. And now they\u2019re back with a vengeance.\u201d Some opponents of the voter ID laws note that these measures disproportionately affect the elderly and the poor, regardless of race. Supporters of voter ID laws say they\u2019re not about race at all, but about common sense and preventing voter fraud. \u201cThat is not a racial issue and it certainly isn\u2019t a hardship issue,\u201d said Deneen Borelli, author of \u201cBlacklash,\u201d which argues Obama is turning America into a welfare nation. \u201cWhen you try to purchase over-the-counter medication or buy liquor or travel, you present photo ID. This is a basic part of everyday transactions.\u201d Historians say there are other ways the post-Reconstruction script is being dusted off and that some of them appear to have nothing to do with race on the surface. Consider the debate over \u201cObamacare,\u201d the nation\u2019s new health care law. The controversy would be familiar to many 19th-century Americans, said Jim Downs, author of \u201cSick from Freedom: African-American Illness and Suffering during the Civil War and Reconstruction.\u201d The notion that the federal government should help those who cannot help themselves wasn\u2019t widely accepted before the Civil War. There were a few charities and municipal hospitals that took care of the sick, but most institutions ignored ordinary people who needed health care, said Downs, a Connecticut College history professor who studies the history of race and medicine in 19th-century America. Reconstruction changed that. Post-Civil War America was marked by epidemics: yellow fever, smallpox and typhus. Freed slaves, who were often malnourished and had few clothes and little shelter, died by the \u201ctens of thousands,\u201d he said. The federal government responded by creating the nation\u2019s first-ever national health care system, directed at newly freed slaves. It was called the Medical Division of the Freedmen\u2019s Bureau. The division built 40 hospitals and hired hundreds of doctors to treat more than a million former slaves from 1865 until it was shut down in 1870 after losing congressional funding, Downs said. \u201cIt absolutely radicalized health care,\u201d he said. \u201cYou can\u2019t argue that government intervention in health is something new or a recent innovation. It originated in the mid-19th century in response to the suffering of freed slaves.\u201d Critics at the time said the new health care system was too radical. They said it would make blacks too reliant on government. The system was expanded to include other vulnerable Americans, such as the elderly, children and the disabled. Yet some still saw it as a black handout, Downs said. \u201cThe whole notion of the modern day \u201cwelfare queen\u201d can be traced to the post-Civil War period when people became very suspicious of the federal government providing relief to ex-slaves,\u201d Downs said. \u201cThey feared this would create a dependent class of people.\u201d Economic fears in the post-Reconstruction era also fueled the white backlash, a pattern that some historians say is repeating itself today. A national economic collapse took place just as freed slaves were gaining political influence. The Panic of 1873 started with a banking collapse and a stock market dive. The result: Tens of thousands of workers, many Civil War veterans, became homeless. People lined up for food and shelter in cities across America. \u201cIt made it more economically competitive for everybody,\u201d Dray said. \u201cYou saw whites become even less generous to African-Americans [than] they might have been.\u201d Some white Southerners channeled their economic anxiety into a systemic attack on the federal government, historians said. Before the collapse, Southern states controlled by Northern politicians and their allies had built hospitals and public schools and created social services to help freed slaves as well as poor whites, said Jerald Podair, a historian at Lawrence University in Wisconsin. But the notion of an activist federal government helping blacks amid tough times created an opening for Reconstruction opponents. One group that took advantage of that opening was the Redeemers, a popular movement led by conservative, pro-business politicians who vowed to \u201csave\u201d the South, said Podair, who is writing a book on Bayard Rustin, a close aide to the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. The Redeemers gained control of most Southern statehouses and pledged to reduce the size of government. They defunded public schools, closed public hospitals and halted road construction, Podair said, all while cutting taxes for the wealthy plantation owners, the 1 percenters of their day. The Redeemers cloaked their rhetoric in the need for more government efficiency, but their goals were also racial, Podair said. \u201cThe Redeemers were interested first and foremost in power,\u201d Podair said. \u201cIf freed slaves received education and medical care, they were that much closer to economic and, eventually, political power. And if the federal government had a major role in the South, that also meant less economic and political power for the Redeemer class.\u201d Podair said some contemporary governors are recycling the same talking points used by the Redeemers. They are invoking the need for austerity while cutting government jobs that employ a high number of blacks and reducing public services that help the poor, a disproportionate number of whom are black. \u201cThere may well be a new post-Reconstruction era of slashed federal budgets and policies that transfer power and resources to state and local governments,\u201d Podair said. \u201cOnce again, initiatives that sound race-neutral on their face will have a devastating racial impact.\u201d Innis has a different take. He said state and local governments can\u2019t afford to keep the same number of jobs because of generous benefits negotiated by unions. Race has nothing to do with it. \u201cIf you have a government job and the pay and benefits is more than a private sector job, something is wrong,\u201d he said. Government cutbacks are designed to help the economy, not inflict pain on any particular group. \u201cUntil we get our economy on track, black and brown people are going to suffer,\u201d he said. The primary weapon white Southerners used to halt Reconstruction was violence. Mobs attacked and killed blacks gathering to vote. They assassinated black officeholders and their white allies. Newspapers sparked race riots and warned of race wars by printing false accounts of black-on-white attacks. We are not seeing anywhere near the level of violence toward black people that followed Reconstruction. But some people fear that the inflammatory rhetoric that helped trigger racial violence in that era is returning. A Google search of the phrase \u201cblack mobs attack white people\u201d yields tens of thousands of hits. Conservative bloggers and columnists say a \u201cwave\u201d of black mobs attacking whites at random has spread across the nation in places such as shopping malls, downtown tourist spots and even \u201cBeat Whitey Nights\u201d at Midwestern fairs. Syndicated conservative columnist Thomas Sowell \u2013 himself African-American \u2013 wrote in a May 15 column for National Review Online that \u201crace war\u201d has returned to America because black gangs are \u201claunching coordinated attacks on whites in public\u201d across America. A Republican state legislator in Maryland, Patrick L. McDonough, warned earlier this year in a letter to the governor that \u201croving mobs of black youths\u201d had been attacking white tourists in Baltimore. One author, Colin Flaherty, wrote a book about this alleged wave of racial violence called, \u201cWhite Girl Bleed a Lot: The Return of Race Riots to America.\u201d The various accounts follow the same pattern: Black \u201cflash mobs\u201d suddenly attack whites in public, followed by a media cover-up. Flaherty, also a talk radio show host, said he first noticed the attacks in 2010. Since then, he claims he has seen \u201cthousands\u201d of videos of black mobs attacking whites. People have called him racist, but Flaherty said he\u2019s just a \u201cguy standing on a corner\u201d reporting what he sees. \u201cWhite liberals go nuts on this,\u201d he said of his book. \u201cWhen people use names like \u2018racist,\u2019 they\u2019re using it to shut down conversation, not engage in it.\u201d The return of race war rhetoric has disturbing historical echoes, said David Godshalk, author of \u201cVeiled Visions: The 1906 Atlanta Race Riot and the Reshaping of American Race Relations.\u201d Godshalk said neither Sowell nor Flaherty have offered any statistical evidence that reports about \u201cblack mobs\u201d are anything more than isolated cases. Sowell did not respond to interview requests. Scores of blacks died during the post-Reconstruction era because newspapers spread false or grossly exaggerated reports of blacks as predators, particularly accounts of black men raping white women, Godshalk said. Some whites used those reports to justify violence and political oppression against blacks, he said. \u201cLongstanding notions that African-Americans were criminals were used to argue that they shouldn\u2019t be leaders in society because they didn\u2019t have the same capabilities as whites, and they weren\u2019t trustworthy enough to hold positions of authority,\u201d said Godshalk, a history professor at Shippensburg University in Pennsylvania who has also written about Reconstruction and lynchings. Those notions of black inferiority eventually infected the legal system during the post-Reconstruction era, historians say. The post-Reconstruction Supreme Court played a major role in destroying what Congress had created through its racial reforms. The court delivered a series of decisions that nullified the Civil Rights Acts of 1866 and 1875 as well as additional laws designed to protect blacks from mob violence at the voting booth, said Peter Irons, a civil rights attorney and author of \u201cA People\u2019s History of the Supreme Court.\u201d In 1883, the court imposed a judicial death sentence on Reconstruction in the \u201cCivil Rights Cases\u201d decision, which allowed private individuals and businesses to discriminate against blacks. Associate Justice Joseph Bradley wrote in the decision that freed slaves should stop being \u201ca special favorite of the laws.\u201d The most notorious post-Reconstruction decision involving race took place in 1895 when the Supreme Court legally sanctioned Jim Crow laws by enshrining the \u201cseparate-but-equal\u201d doctrine in Plessy v. Ferguson. The court upheld a Louisiana law requiring that federal rail cars provide different facilities for white and black passengers. By the late 19th century, the Supreme Court had \u201cturned its back on the claims of blacks and opened its arms to those of corporations,\u201d Irons said. It was the onset of the Gilded Age, an era of widening income inequality that saw the court first introduce \u201ccorporate personhood,\u201d the concept that a corporation has the legal rights of a person. \u201cPeople were getting tired of concerns about racial minorities,\u201d said Irons, an activist whose book on the Supreme Court was partly inspired by the late liberal historian Howard Zinn and his book, \u201cA People\u2019s History of the United States.\u201d \u201cThe court is generally a mirror of the broader society, and that was the way most people felt at the time.\u201d Irons and other liberal observers fear the current Supreme Court is drifting in a similar direction and anticipate that it will overturn or weaken a key section of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 as well as affirmative action in college admissions. The court is expected to hear a challenge from Shelby County, Alabama, to Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act, which requires nine Southern states and parts of others to \u201cpre-clear\u201d with federal officials any voting measures that could potentially restrict black voters. The court is also due to rule on a case on affirmative action in college admission policies in Fisher v. University of Texas. Irons said the conservative majority on the contemporary court would be doing what their counterparts did during Reconstruction, avoiding a frontal assault on civil rights laws and other measures that protect women and workers, while eviscerating the laws. \u201cIt\u2019s unlikely that the court would render any decisions that would be totally reactionary on issues of race,\u201d said Irons, \u201cbut what they\u2019re doing in the current court is whittling away and cutting back very gradually on things like racial, gender and wage discrimination.\u201d Some conservatives, though, have a different perspective on Reconstruction and any modern parallels. Most historians say Reconstruction ended with the disputed presidential contest of 1876. An election too close to call was resolved when candidate Rutherford B. Hayes agreed to pull Northern troops out of the South in exchange for the presidency. Schweikart, co-author of \u201cA Patriot\u2019s History of the United States,\u201d said the United States abandoned Reconstruction because the nation could not call itself a democracy while keeping half its population under military occupation. \u201cReconstruction ended, pure and simple, because the North could not afford economically, politically or socially to maintain a standing army in a part of the U.S. for an indefinite time and still call America a democratic republic,\u201d said Schweikart, a history professor at the University of Dayton in Ohio. Borelli, author of \u201cBlacklash,\u201d does see one contemporary link with 19th-century America. She argues that Obama is actually encouraging a new form of servitude to what she calls the \u201cBig Government Plantation.\u201d Since Obama became president, a record number of Americans, at least 46 million, now receive food stamps. And one in six Americans receives some form of government aid as the nation struggles to recover from the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression. \u201cThere are a lot of people who are relying on government for their basic everyday needs: food, clothing and shelter,\u201d said Borelli, who is outreach director for FreedomWorks, a Washington-based group that advocates for smaller government and lower taxes. \u201cWhen you rely on government, your liberties are reduced.\u201d Another conservative said Obama has tacitly endorsed reverse racism. \u201cYou can\u2019t have a legitimate disagreement with the president if you\u2019re white without being called a racist,\u201d said Stephen Marks, creator of FightBigotry.com, a Super PAC that produced a television ad accusing Obama of not standing up to racism. Marks said Obama said nothing when Vice President Joe Biden recently told an audience of black and white voters that Republicans were \u201cgoing to put y\u2019all back in chains.\u201d \u201cThey\u2019re the ones who play the race card, 100% of the time,\u201d Marks said of Obama and Democrats. \u201cThe Republicans don\u2019t have the gonads to respond because they\u2019re so afraid of being called a racist.\u201d There\u2019s little disagreement among contemporary historians about what happened to the South when the nation abandoned Reconstruction. The region became a divided society where race filtered into everything, said Dray, author of \u201cCapitol Men.\u201d \u201cIt had a paralyzing effect. Business interests didn\u2019t want to invest there. Immigrants didn\u2019t want to go there,\u201d Dray said. \u201cThe South became this tainted place. Instead of moving into the 20th century, it stayed put in the 19th century.\u201d The Jim Crow laws that marked the end of Reconstruction stayed put for at least 60 years. It would take a century before the contemporary civil rights movement restored the political and civil rights of blacks. Some historians argue that the United States did not actually become a democracy until 1965 with the passage of the Voting Rights Act. Black pioneers like Revels disappeared from the history books. After serving his Senate term, he didn\u2019t seek reappointment and returned to Mississippi, where he eventually became president of Alcorn State College and pastor of a church. He lost much of his black support for not speaking out against the abuses that ended Reconstruction, said Benjamin, the Boston University professor. \u201cHe was an accommodationist,\u201d Benjamin said. \u201cHe was in the Senate standing up for white folks and telling people not to be so hard on Southern plantation owners. He didn\u2019t use his platform to represent African-Americans.\u201d In 1901, Revels collapsed and died during a church meeting in Mississippi. That same year, the last black member of the House of Representatives finished his final term. Congress resumed being an all-white institution. Blacks had been driven out of office by beatings and assassinations. Revels\u2019 death barely got a mention in the Southern press. His fellow black congressmen received the same treatment. Revisionist historians were already depicting Reconstruction as a fatal example of government overreach and Northern \u201ccarpetbaggers\u201d and \u201cscalawags\u201d coming South to profit off of the regions\u2019 misery, said Dray, author of \u201cCapitol Men.\u201d \u201cWhen some of them passed away years later, the Southern press barely mentioned it,\u201d Dray said. \u201cIt was a part of American history that people did not want to remember. No one wanted to talk about it or think about it.\u201d One group of Americans, however, never forgot what Revels represented. During the Great Depression, Dray said, the federal government dispatched interviewers from the Works Progress Administration to the South to collect oral histories from former slaves. The interviewers noticed a curious sight as they walked into the shacks of the former slaves. They saw faded copies of an 1872 lithograph depicting the first seven black members of Congress, including Revels. The image is still haunting. Revels and his fellow racial pioneers are posed together, dressed in vested suits and bow ties. They exude pride and determination, even though only several years earlier they weren\u2019t even considered fully human by many Americans. Revels sits in the front row of the group portrait. He stares forward in the picture, a man who seems confident in what the future would bring. What would he think of Obama if he could somehow see him today? Would he be delighted at what America has become in 2012? Or would he think the future he embodied still seems far away?",

            "article_content": "The first revenge killing after 9/11 was the murder of a Sikh man in Arizona Since then, Sikhs in America have reported hundreds of hate crimes Often, attackers mistake Sikhs for Muslims because of their turbans Earlier this month, Prabhjot Singh sat down with his 4-year-old son Hukam and tried for the first time to explain the horrific incident that altered the Manhattan family\u2019s life. \u201cA few years ago, a few men hurt me because of what I looked like, because they thought I was bad,\u201d Singh said. Hukam stared back, confused. \u201cWhy?\u201d he asked. \u201cTheir hearts were asleep and they were not thinking about Papaji as a person,\u201d Singh said, using a Punjabi term of respect for father. On the night of September 21, 2013, Singh, a highly accomplished doctor and professor, was walking with a friend on 110th Street near Central Park. Both men are Sikhs and have long beards and wear turbans. Singh heard someone yell: \u201cTerrorist, Osama, get him.\u201d Singh ran but not fast enough. A group of boys and young men on bicycles taunted him using racial slurs. One pulled his beard and then the attackers punched and kicked him repeatedly. He lay on the ground, waiting for them to stop, when passers-by intervened. Singh ended up in the hospital with a broken jaw, dislodged teeth and other gruesome injuries. But Singh expressed gratitude. He understood it could have been so much worse. Fifteen years ago Thursday, an Indian Sikh immigrant was gunned down at the gas station he managed in Mesa, Arizona. It was the first revenge killing in the wake of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. The assailant said he wanted to \u201cgo out and shoot some towel heads\u201d for the actions of Osama bin Laden. Hate crimes against Muslims and those perceived as Muslims spiked after 9/11. Sikh men grow long beards and wear turbans as a commitment to their faith, and many Americans mistake them for Muslims.  Reports of incidents in the immediate aftermath of 9/11 and concerns that hate crimes would rise prompted the founding of the Sikh Coalition, which has grown into the largest Sikh advocacy and civil rights organization in America. In the first month after 9/11, the group documented more than 300 cases of violence and discrimination against Sikhs in America. In the years since, hundreds of hate crimes have been reported, many of them described by police as cases of mistaken identity, like the September 15, 2001, murder in Mesa. As America marks the 15th anniversary of 9/11 this month, many Sikhs say they feel no safer in this country. A climate of fear has prevailed since the Paris attacks in November; it has surfaced every time shootings and terrorist attacks are blamed on Muslims. Many feel the focus on immigrants in the 2016 presidential election has added to the hatemongering. \u201cI definitely feel the uptick of more hateful rhetoric in the country,\u201d says Singh. The irony of being attacked was not lost on Singh: He had written about the violence against Sikhs, including a New York Times piece after the 2012 mass shooting at a Milwaukee temple. A year later, he, too, had become a victim, finding himself in the uncomfortable position of having to explain to his young son why he was attacked simply because of the way he looks. \u201cWhatever I think the environment is around us, I know children absorb all the messages,\u201d he says. \u201cHow can we prepare them to meet the world that may not be prepared to meet them? \u201cWhy are we being attacked for being Sikh?\u201d he says. \u201cMy tradition teaches me to ask what are we doing as a community to have a far more welcoming embrace of people who are different than us.\u201d Sikhism was founded in the 16th century by Guru Nanak in Punjab, an area that is now divided between India and Pakistan. Nanak rejected the rituals involved with other South Asian religions and stressed the importance of good deeds such as serving others and treating all people equally. The monotheistic religion has more than 25 million followers worldwide and about 500,000 in the United States. Yet a majority of Americans \u2013 60% \u2013 admitted in a 2015 survey that they knew nothing at all about Sikhs. Lawyer and activist Valarie Kaur says the threat of violence seems to have become mainstreamed. Her grandfather settled in California a century ago, and she knows firsthand from her family that discrimination against Sikhs existed long before 2001. But 9/11, she says, was a paradigm shift, a turning point. She used to talk about living in the \u201cshadow of 9/11.\u201d Then the shadow turned out to be long, and what seemed temporary became permanent. \u201cBigotry on the fringe has been cemented,\u201d says Kaur, whose 2008 documentary, \u201cDivided We Fall,\u201d explored Sikhs in the United States and what it meant to be American in a post-9/11 world. \u201cThe threat of hate and racism has become a part of our daily lives,\u201d she says. Despite the current climate, both Singh and Kaur expressed optimism for the future. Both are vocal about their Sikh identities and talk about landmark changes they hope will make things better in America. They point to younger generations of Sikhs who are fiercely proud of their outward identities and to people like Rana Singh Sodhi, who lost two brothers within a matter of months and became a strong voice for his community. On Thursday, Singh Sodhi will again gather with family and friends at the corner of 80th Street and University Drive in Mesa, Arizona. The Chevron station had been the pride of his older brother Balbir, who arrived in the United States in 1988 and worked hard to achieve the American dream. That dream shattered in 2001, and now a small marble-and-granite memorial bears these words etched in gold lettering: \u201cHe was killed simply because of the way he looked.\u201d This is ground zero for the Sodhi family. Balbir\u2019s killer, Frank Roque, told the police: \u201cI\u2019m a patriot and American. I\u2019m American. I\u2019m a damn American.\u201d Losing a father in a shooting Balbir considered himself a patriot, too. An hour before he died, he had driven to a nearby Costco to purchase plants for new landscaping at the gas station. On his way out of the store, he emptied his wallet, donating $74 to the 9/11 victims\u2019 fund. Then he called Rana and asked him to bring a few American flags to display. Balbir was the eldest of eight siblings in a farming family from the Indian state of Punjab. He and his brothers resettled in America and felt indebted to the nation that gave them new opportunities. But 10 months after Balbir\u2019s murder, a second brother, Sukhpal, was also gunned down, while driving his cab in San Francisco. Police said it was not a hate crime, but Rana is certain that both his brothers were killed because of their Sikh identity. \u201cI understand that everyone has to leave this world but not because we wear a turban, wear a beard,\u201d he says. \u201cAmerica is the most diverse country in the world, but people have zero knowledge about who we are.\u201d Rana Singh Sodhi could easily have been consumed by anger or bitterness. Instead he took it upon himself to begin educating people at churches, schools and community events. He\u2019s saddened when he meets Sikh men who shave their beards and abandon their turbans out of fear. \u201cI don\u2019t want to live scared,\u201d he says. \u201cThis is America. I should be able to live the way I want to live.\u201d Sikh Americans suffered their darkest moment on August 5, 2012, when white supremacist Wade Michael Page went on a shooting rampage at a Sikh gurdwara, or temple, in Oak Creek, Wisconsin. Page killed one woman and five men; all the men were wearing turbans. At the time, it was the worst hate crime committed in a house of faith since the 1963 church bombing in Birmingham, Alabama. Although the incident made national news, it did not get the same attention as other shooting incidents, says activist Kaur. \u201cIt happened on Sunday. By the following Sunday, we were bumped,\u201d Kaur says. \u201cThe media did not think the American public had the attention or did not care enough to understand this community. They could imagine a movie theater or an elementary school or a black church. But not a gurdwara.\u201d Sikhism in America Since then, Sikh Americans have made some important gains, Kaur says. That includes an announcement in 2015 that the FBI would begin tracking hate crimes against Sikhs. Sikh Americans had lobbied for years for such documentation, arguing it was a key step in combating such crimes. The first report will be released later this year. \u201cIt is not going to prevent an Oak Creek massacre, but it was a landmark civil rights victory,\u201d Kaur says. Ultimately, she says, the only way to prevent violence and discrimination is for people to get to know each other. Oneness and love, core foundations of the Sikh faith, are the only way to save the Sikh community, she says. Sikhism also embraces a concept called seva, which means selfless service. Kaur says Sikhs must go beyond education or lobbying and engage in seva in their neighborhoods to gain full acceptance in this country. Prabhjot Singh, the Manhattan doctor, agrees. \u201cI deeply believe in the Sikh spirit of seva,\u201d he says. \u201cWorking in our communities where we live is one of the more powerful things we can do. \u201cShortly after I was attacked, I prepared to shift my work, to work in a community context, and learn how to be more rooted in the work of creating a more loving nation. It\u2019s not easy, and I\u2019m no expert. But if anything, being attacked primed me to listen more carefully and feel the consequences of our choices more deeply.\u201d When he sat down with his son, Singh told him their lives were forever connected to the lives of his assailants. And that they would spend a long time thinking and talking about it, just like he asks Hukam to think about times he hurts his younger brother. One man was later arrested in connection with the attack and charged with aggravated harassment and committing a hate crime. No one else has been apprehended. After the beating, Singh knew it was important for the Sikh community that justice was done, but more important for him, he would like to meet the perpetrators. Perhaps, he says, he is na\u00efve, but he believes that getting to know people who are different is the best way to create change. Singh would rather his attackers be taught than caught. He wants the streets of Harlem to be safe for his sons. More than anything, he wants that group of young men and boys to stop hating. Singh posed the question to his son. \u201cWhat should I do to them if I meet them?\u201d Hukam smiled. \u201cYou have to wake up their hearts.\u201d For Singh, that was the right answer.",

            "article_content": "Trump is overwhelmingly losing the black vote to Hillary Clinton He has recently begun to reach out to African-Americans for their vote Donald Trump developed a new campaign pitch this week, arguing that African-Americans have been struggling and taken for granted by the Democratic Party and thus should consider a different direction this November. \u201cYou\u2019re living in poverty, your schools are no good, you have no jobs, 58% of your youth is unemployed \u2013 what the hell do you have to lose?\u201d Trump told an audience Friday in Dimondale, Michigan. (A recent CNNMoney Reality Check has found Trump\u2019s 58% statistic to be true, but misleading.) In the same speech, he predicted that were he to run for re-election after a first term, he would capture 95% of the African-American vote. The next day, in Fredericksburg, Virginia, Trump acknowledged the GOP\u2019s longtime unpopularity with black voters and said he wanted the party to \u201cbe the home of the African-American voter once again.\u201d But his historically low support among black voters and a series of stumbles throughout his campaign suggest he will have some work to do. A new NBC/Wall Street Journal poll found Hillary Clinton beating him among that demographic 91% to 1%. Here\u2019s a brief look at Trump\u2019s history with African-Americans on the campaign trail. Two of Trump\u2019s earliest supporters were a pair of African-American women, Lynnette \u201cDiamond\u201d Hardaway and Rochelle \u201cSilk\u201d Richardson, who became almost instant YouTube stars after posting their \u201cStump for Trump\u201d videos early in his campaign. Trump soon began touting them at his rallies and even bringing them on stage with him a few times, cementing their celebrity status. After a Black Lives Matter protester was shoved to the ground and beaten by a half-dozen white Trump supporters at a rally last November, Trump said on Fox News, \u201cMaybe he should have been roughed up because it was absolutely disgusting what he was doing.\u201d Trump later said he did not condone the physical confrontation. Shortly after the BLM protester was beaten at one of his rallies, Trump announced that he would meet with a large group of black pastors in New York, where they would endorse him. His campaign initially trumpeted the event, but several black pastors invited to the gathering quickly rebutted the endorsement talk, with one calling him an \u201cinsult and embarrassment.\u201d This forced the cancellation of a planned press conference and left Trump in an awkward spot. But he still held the event and highlighted the black pastors who he said were supporting him. \u201cI saw love in that room. I see love everywhere I go,\u201d Trump said. In the thick of the Republican primaries, Trump received the support of former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke. But rather than immediately denounce Duke, Trump claimed to CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper that he did not know him or his affiliations. Trump later blamed his answer on a \u201cbad earpiece.\u201d At a March rally in North Carolina, a white Trump supporter was charged with assault after video captured him sucker-punching a black protester. Only a few weeks earlier, Trump had been criticized for urging his supporters to \u201cknock the crap out of\u201d anybody \u201cgetting ready to throw a tomato\u201d and vowed to pay for their legal fees should they face charges. \u201cKnock the crap out of them, would you? Seriously. OK? Just knock the hell \u2013 I promise you, I will pay for the legal fees. I promise, I promise,\u201d Trump said. While Trump was talking in June about the fallout from the sucker-punch incident at the North Carolina rally, he mentioned how a black supporter of his punched and kicked a white protester at a separate rally soon after. He attempted to point out how much African-American support he had by acknowledging a black supporter in the crowd and saying, \u201cOh, look at my African-American over here. Look at him.\u201d Trump last month hired former \u201cApprentice\u201d star Omarosa Manigault to be his outreach director to black voters. Manigault, who had been a Democrat and supporter of Clinton and President Barack Obama, told NPR she had a 76-page outreach strategy. \u201cHe had no idea, until he started running, how many young black men and women were dying in the streets of Chicago,\u201d Manigault told NPR. \u201cAnd so those are issues that I not only advise him on \u2013 that these are things that have to stop, that we have to find ways to make sure that the value of black lives in inner cities around this country is elevated.\u201d One of Trump\u2019s earliest political supporters, Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions, on Thursday unearthed a nearly 30-year-old controversy: the mogul\u2019s 1989 call to \u201cbring back the death penalty\u201d in light of the so-called \u201cCentral Park Five\u201d case concerning the rape of a white Central Park jogger. Five black and Hispanic teens were falsely convicted in the crime and later exonerated, but Sessions said Trump\u2019s push to reinstate capital punishment in the Empire State proved he\u2019s long been tough on crime.",

            "article_content": "Bernie Sanders and his supporters are expected to fight for control of the Democratic Party's platform this summer The DNC's platform-drafting committee meets in Washington on Wednesday and Thursday Hillary Clinton is the presumptive Democratic nominee, but the party\u2019s civil war is set to continue at the Democratic Convention in Philadelphia as Bernie Sanders and his supporters fight for control of the platform \u2013 the party\u2019s statement of its values and beliefs. Sanders has been pulling Clinton to the left throughout the campaign, on everything from trade to the environment. The crafting of the platform offers a rare chance to enshrine many of those changes and Sanders and his supporters are ready for battle. Sanders won a key concession from the Democratic National Committee last month securing five seats on the 15-member panel writing the platform (Clinton won six seats and DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz picked four members.) One of the first steps will come Wednesday and Thursday when the DNC\u2019s platform-drafting committee meets in Washington to hear testimony on possible changes. Here are the platform fights to watch this summer: America\u2019s relationship with Israel is likely to be the nastiest fight in Philadelphia. The starkest indication that Clinton and Sanders were on two separate worlds when it comes to Israel came at the American Israel Public Affairs Committee\u2019s annual conference in March \u2013 Clinton delivered a fairly mainline argument in support of Israel as a cherished partner in the Middle East. But Sanders, the only Jewish candidate in the field, delivered a broadside from the other side of the country \u2013 skipping the conference and blasting Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. \u201cTo my mind, as friends, we are obligated to speak the truth as we see it. This is what real friendship demands, especially in difficult times,\u201d Sanders said. Driving home that point will be two of Sanders\u2019 five selections for the group which is drafting the platform \u2013 James Zogby, president of the Arab American Institute, once compared Israel\u2019s treatment of Palestinians to the Holocaust and Cornel West, a prominent surrogate for Sanders throughout the campaign, once blasted Netanyahu as a \u201cwar criminal\u201d in a 2014 rally (later in the speech he also called Obama a \u201cwar criminal\u201d for using drone strikes). Zogby defended his role in a rare blog post Monday, after he said he heard two men at a restaurant blasting his involvement in writing the platform. \u201cIn addition to all of the other critical issues Bernie Sanders has raised, he has done our nation and the cause of peace a service by bringing the matter of Israel/Palestine into the national debate. It belongs there and deserves to be discussed on its merits, without rancor and without fear,\u201d Zogby wrote. Sanders has drawn sharp distinctions between himself and Clinton on fracking \u2013 hydraulic fracturing to reach oil and gas deposits \u2013 throughout the campaign, and especially in his run in California. He then said the party itself needs to take a clear stance against the practice. \u201cI hope that the Democratic Party platform decides it is on the side of the American people, and I would hope that the Democratic party makes it clear that it has the guts to stand up the fossil fuel industry. That\u2019s exactly what I expect in the Democratic National Convention, to do what the American people want,\u201d Sanders said last week. Sanders blasted Clinton in April, accusing her of flatly supporting the controversial practice. Clinton supported fracking during her time at the State Department, but has taken a more nuanced approach as a candidate. Count this as a battle Sanders has already largely won, hammering away at the Keystone XL pipeline until Clinton, fairly early in the race, announced her clear opposition to it as well \u2013 after avoiding taking a position on it. Representing Sanders will be the leader of the fight against the Keystone XL pipeline, Bill McKibben, and representing Clinton will be former Environmental Protection Agency Carol Browner \u2013 who fought ardently for carbon dioxide limits as the leader of Obama\u2019s environmental efforts. Sanders has also pulled Clinton to the left on trade, spurring her to oppose the Trans-Pacific Partnership. The platform approved at the 2012 convention calls for \u201cfree and fair trade\u201d \u2013 with a focus on spurring exports while maintaining human rights, environmental and other protections. The key question will be whether the party drops the \u201cfree\u201d from its platform. In one of the most awkward positions of an incredible campaign season, Sanders and Clinton now stand to the left of Obama on trade, eight years after his campaign was given the reins of the platform as the party\u2019s presumptive nominee. Like most battles, on trade, the party has to decide how big its tent will be. Party leaders and delegates have to strike a balance between saying something clear and bold and leaving enough space for the vast majority of Democrats to support, said Christine Pelosi, daughter of House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi and a veteran of party platform battles in California and at the DNC. Each side, she said, should send in their strongest voice with the hopes that their position is adopted and not start from a point of concessions. \u201cThe warriors have the best diplomatic skills because they know what it is to fight, therefore they can be trusted to go back to their people and say \u2018I gave it our all,\u2019\u201d said Pelosi, who also runs trainings for liberal and Democratic activists. \u201cIf you can get them to agree, you can get everyone else to agree. Both sides will say \u2018We all had the strongest voice at the table.\u2019\u201d But, she said, at the end, they have to agree on a statement that will be actually written into the platform \u2013 because otherwise the fight wasn\u2019t worth it: \u201cThere\u2019s no point in having a platform fight if, in the end, people are going to just walk away from it.\u201d Sanders wants Depression-era banking regulations, the Glass-Steagall Act, reinstated and Clinton argues that reinstating old rules ignores the complexities of modern finance. Wall Street has been a glaring weakness for Clinton throughout the campaign as Sanders has blasted her for giving high-dollar speeches to Goldman Sachs and she stumbled in an early debate, citing the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks for her support of Wall Street. Both candidates support keeping a tight rein on Wall Street \u2013 but Sanders and his supporters have been much starker in their language. Like many of the battles, this one is not a question of \u201cWhere does the party go?\u201d but instead, \u201cHow far?\u201d Mo Elleithee, former communications director for the DNC, said most of the fights were already hashed out during the primary and any difference is more a matter of how far to the left does the party shift, versus any dramatic changes. \u201cOn most of the economic, bread-and-butter issue I think it\u2019s a matter of degrees, not a matter of direction,\u201d said Elleithee, who now runs the Georgetown Institute of Politics and Public Service. \u201cBoth candidates and the party as a whole wants to raise the minimum wage. Bodth candidates and the party as a whole believes in Wall Street regulation.\u201d Sanders already successfully pulled Clinton to the left on minimum wage \u2013 pushing her from supporting a $12-an-hour minimum to the $15 minimum. The party itself has already adopted the $15 minimum, following a successful push by liberal activists at a DNC meeting last year. And Rep. Keith Ellison, one of Sanders\u2019 picks for the platform panel, drafted legislation that would set the federal minimum wage at $15 an hour. Protesters being organized by Good Jobs Nation plan to show up to the platform drafting hearing in Washington Wednesday to ensure the $15 stays in the platform. Platforms are typically dominated by the presumptive nominee \u2013 the candidate who had long ago locked up the nomination and was the effective leader of the party heading into the convention. And planks inside the platform have often been reserved as consolation prizes for the runner-up. Universal health care was a consolation prize Clinton won from Obama in 2008, with his promise to make it a centerpiece of the 2008 platform and push for it. But now Clinton is on the other side of that equation, with Sanders and his supporters pushing for the more expansive health care coverage and Clinton defending the new status quo. Some of Clinton\u2019s sharpest attacks throughout the campaign accused Sanders of risking all the expansions achieved through Obamacare. In the heat of the Iowa race, when it appeared Sanders may upset her in the very first contest, Clinton said that Sanders proposal for single-payer health care would risk all the gains made under Obama. \u201cI don\u2019t want us to end up in gridlock. People can\u2019t wait. People who have health emergencies can\u2019t wait for us to have a theoretical debate about some better idea that will never, ever come to pass,\u201d Clinton said. A year ago, the widespread protests over police shootings which created the Black Lives Matter movement, looked like they could tear the Democratic Party apart \u2013 like the Civil Rights and anti-war protests decades earlier. Black Lives Matter protesters shut down a Sanders rally in Seattle last August and, partly in response, Sanders hired a top BLM activist to be his national press secretary. After watching the stunning takeover of the Sanders rally, Clinton met privately with BLM protesters and later released video of the meeting. And at then end of last August, as a preventative measure, the DNC adopted a resolution last August saying that the party stands with BLM protesters. There will be plenty of splits among Democrats in Philadelphia, but Black Lives Matter does not appear to be one of them. In 2012, the party included a platform plank blasting the Citizens United decision, then just two years old. But long before the 2016 race Clinton\u2019s supporters had embraced the reality of super PACs, launching their own \u201cReady for Hillary\u201d in 2013. The dilemma \u2013 accepting super PAC support while blasting the decision that made it possible \u2013 seemed accepted wisdom, but Sanders turned it instead into one of the nastiest battles of the campaign. Sanders built a movement saying he refused to take money from the \u201cmillionaires and billionaires\u201d and promised repeatedly that he would not start his own super PAC. He rarely mentioned her by name, but the campaign finance knocks were aimed squarely at Clinton. The Clinton campaign fired back by noting the nurses union was supporting him with their super PAC. The party will now have to decide whether opposing the Citizens United decision also means flatly opposing super PACs. It\u2019s not technically a fight for the party\u2019s platform, or even one that will be decided in Philadelphia, but what to do with superdelegates \u2013 Democratic party leaders and officials who are not committed based on election results, but instead are free to support whomever they like \u2013 will be one of the biggest fights for the party. The idea itself \u2013 of party leaders making selections separate from election results \u2013 harkens back to before the reforms that Democrats made in the wake of their last seriously chaotic convention, 1968 in Chicago. And even though the party shifted from leaders and officials calling the shots, a small pocket of them \u2013 so-called superdelegates \u2013 were kept as a way for the party to unify behind a candidate after a particularly nasty primary fight, like, say, this one. Clinton is all but certain to win the nomination based on the votes of those superdelegates \u2013 the embodiment of the Democratic establishment Sanders and his supporters have railed against. The Sanders campaign has launched a two-track strategy of attempting to flip those superdelegates to supporting him \u2013 with minimal success so far \u2013 while blasting the system itself. Elleithee, who was a spokesman for Clinton in 2008, pointed out the irony for Sanders: If superdelegates voted in line with their states\u2019 results, Sanders would lose. So he has to exploit the system before he could ever abolish it, he said. He argued it might appear they are swinging the nomination to Clinton, but she would win without them. \u201cI\u2019m not arguing that it\u2019s wrong to have a conversation about the role of superdelegates, all I\u2019m saying is that they have never impacted a nomination,\u201d Elleithee said.",
