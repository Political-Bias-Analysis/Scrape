            "article_content": "Members of a southeastern Idaho youth church group were being driven around by their chaperone last month,delivering Thanksgiving cards in the neighborhood to those they were thankful for when they decided last-minute to stop at the home of the county sheriff\u2019s house, according to a probable cause affidavit later in court. What happened next outside the home of Bingham County Sheriff Craig Rowland has put the small Idaho community in the national spotlight. The sheriff is facing calls for his resignation after charges that \u200bstem from an incident in which he allegedly pointed a gun at his long-time neighbor, and later during an interview with investigators allegedly made disparaging remarks about Native Americans The incident took place on the night of November 9 in the town of Blackfoot, Idaho. The seven girls had hand-traced and cut paper turkeys with messages listing \u201cwhy they were thankful for certain people,\u201d according to the affidavit. The plan was to tape the turkey on the front door of the recipient\u2019s house, ring the doorbell and run away before they were seen, according to the affidavit. But when two of the girls tried to deliver a paper turkey, the sheriff walked out of his house with a gun drawn, according to the affidavit. Chelsea Cox, the group\u2019s chaperone who also lives down the street from Rowland, was told by the girls that the sheriff had seen them, and they couldn\u2019t deliver the card without being caught, according to the affidavit. Shortly afterward, Cox told investigators, she saw Rowland trying to wave her down with a gun in his other hand. When Rowland approached the car, Cox opened the door and she told him that they were \u201cjust here to drop off something for Lisa,\u201d the sheriff\u2019s wife, the affidavit says. Cox told investigators that Rowland then pointed his gun at her and two young girls in the passenger seat and told her to \u201cget the f\u2013k out of the car.\u201d As Cox went to shift her car into park, Rowland moved closer to her and then grabbed and yanked her hair while ordering her to get out of the car again, according to the affidavit. He then allegedly pointed the gun at Cox and asked her what she was doing. When she tried to answer him, the affidavit said that Rowland, \u201cyelled that he could or would shoot Cox.\u201d Rowland made an initial appearance in court Wednesday morning on two felony charges \u2013 aggravated battery and aggravated assault \u2013 in addition to a misdemeanor charge, the exhibition or use of a deadly weapon. Rowland has not yet entered a plea but will have a preliminary appearance on December 29. Rowland\u2019s attorney Justin Oleson says that at that appearance, prosecutors will present their evidence to a magistrate judge who will then determine whether there is enough to proceed with the case. \u201cProbable cause affidavits are someone\u2019s interpretation of what they heard someone else say and are not necessarily accurate or a complete recitation of the facts that occurred,\u201d he said. According to that affidavit, Rowland told investigators in an interview that he believed the people he saw could have been casing the neighborhood, and he said at no time was his finger on the trigger of his gun. Rowland and his wife also told investigators, according to the affidavit, that they had received threats: a former inmate had a discussion with Rowland\u2019s wife in a grocery store and Rowland had been the purported target of harassment by another local resident. When detailing the threats, Rowland allegedly made disparaging comments to investigators about Native Americans. \u201cI have been doing this job for 36 years, I\u2019ve had drunk Indians drive down my cul-de-sac, I\u2019ve had drunk Indians come to my door, I live just off of the reservation, we have a lot of reservation people around us that are not good people, they, they committed crimes, we\u2019ve arrested them, so on and so forth,\u201d Rowland told investigators, according to the probable cause affidavit. Oleson, who says he was present for the interview, said that Rowland is not a racist and that the comments were, \u201ctaken completely out of context.\u201d \u201cIt was a descriptive term; it wasn\u2019t meant to be racial against that type of people,\u201d Oleson said. In the weeks since the incident, there has been a push for the elected sheriff to resign, including from the local police union and the mayor. Speaking to local media, Bingham\u2019s three county commissioners all condemned the comments, but stopped short of calling for his resignation Rowland told investigators that although he had an alcoholic beverage during dinner that night, the affidavit notes that he said the recent daylight saving time change had \u201creally messed me up.\u201d Oleson confirmed that Rowland did take some \u201ctime away from the office to allow the investigation to occur,\u201d but is back at work as the sheriff. The only way Rowland could be removed from office if he does not resign would be to recall him, according to Idaho\u2019s constitution. Some 20% of Bingham County residents who were registered to vote in the last general election would need to sign a petition for a special recall election to be held. During that special recall election, a simple majority would need to vote in favor of a recall to remove Rowland from office. The Shoshone-Bannock tribes, who live \u200bon the Fort Hall Reservation \u2013 which Rowland alluded to in his alleged remarks \u2013 issued a statement on December 16, saying that the sheriff\u2019s remarks were extremely offensive. \u201cWe ask Rowland to officially step down as Sheriff and offer a public apology to the Fort Hall community,\u201d Chairman Devon Boyer said. Bingham County prosecutor Paul Rogers told the Bingham News Chronicle he hopes Rowland considers resigning \u201cto allow Bingham County to begin the healing process and allow the officers and the County to continue on safely and effectively.\u201d CNN has reached out to Rogers for comment, but did not immediately hear back. The Snake River Fraternal Order of Police Lodge #35, whose 125 members work at five law enforcement agencies in the Bingham County area, including the sheriff\u2019s office, joined the call for Rowland to step down, saying that it was disheartened by the incident. The mayor of Blackfoot, Idaho, Bingham\u2019s county seat, also called for his resignation. \u201cHis comments do not in any way reflect the City\u2019s nor the Blackfoot Police Department\u2019s attitudes towards our neighbors at Fort Hall,\u201d mayor Marc Carroll said in a statement. Oleson says the case against his client was politically motivated and should have never been charged. \u201cIt has nothing to do with what happened,\u201d he said, adding the calls to resign are \u201ctruly political jockeying\u201d and \u201cpoliticians at work.\u201d According to the probable cause affidavit, Rowland told Blackfoot Police Department Chief Scott Gay that on November 9 he confronted a vehicle after he said two people approached his house. \u201cHe said he had his gun in hand but no flash light,\u201d Gay wrote in a report sent to the Idaho State Police. \u201cHe saw a vehicle coming back from the end of his road\u2026he approached the vehicle in the road and stopped it.\u201d Rowland then said he grabbed the driver and pulled them from the vehicle by their hair, according to an excerpt of the report mentioned in the probable cause affidavit. He asked her, \u201cwho the f\u2013k are you what the f\u2013k are you doing,\u201d a couple of times, according to the affidavit, until the driver identified herself as his neighbor, Chelsea Cox. CNN reached out to Cox for comment but has not received a response. Cox\u2019s husband told investigators, according to the affidavit, that Rowland had been a close family friend for 30 years, and that Cox had not only grown up in the house next to the sheriff but also lived down the road from him. Oleson said that Cox is like a daughter to the sheriff, and he had the conversation with the Blackfoot Police chief because he was upset and thought, \u201cOh I screwed up and I think I scared my family member.\u201d He also told CNN that Rowland had spoken with Cox since the incident. \u201cSheriff Rowland lifted the gun and pointed it at Cox\u2019s head while holding the gun approximately two inches from her forehead,\u201d the affidavit said. \u201cThat\u2019s when I really got scared because the gun was still at my head and he didn\u2019t know who I was,\u201d Cox told investigators, according to the affidavit. After he asked her who she was again, the affidavit said that Cox said she told him, \u201cChelsea.\u201d The affidavit says that Rowland told her to not ever do this again and that he could shoot her. Authorities also interviewed the seven minors who were in the car at the time, who all appeared to corroborate the series of events described by Cox.",

            "article_content": "Two years after actor Jussie Smollett claimed he was the victim of a racist and homophobic attack, a jury has found the former \u201cEmpire\u201d star guilty of lying to police. The verdict Thursday was the final twist in a case that gripped the nation from the start. Here\u2019s a look at how we got here. Smollett told authorities he was attacked in the early morning hours of January 29, 2019, by two men who were yelling racial and homophobic slurs. He said the two men put a noose around his neck and poured an unknown substance on him, according to Chicago police. Celebrities, politicians and advocacy groups rallied behind the actor, with former President Donald Trump calling the alleged attack \u201chorrible.\u201d In his first public statement since the reported attack, Smollett thanked his fans for the support and attempted to dispel doubts questioning the integrity of his story, saying he had \u201cbeen 100% factual and consistent on every level.\u201d The many twists and turns in the Jussie Smollett investigation Police began an investigation, taking Smollett\u2019s sweater and rope and eventually obtaining video showing the actor entering a Lowe\u2019s store after the alleged attack with what appeared to be a noose around his neck. A day after the alleged attack, police said they found surveillance footage showing \u201cpotential persons of interest wanted for questioning.\u201d About a month later, then-Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson said Smollett allegedly paid two brothers $3,500 to stage the attack to take \u201cadvantage of the pain and anger of racism to promote his career,\u201d saying the brothers confessed to the plot. \u201cAs far as we can tell, the scratching and bruising that you saw on his face were most likely self-inflicted,\u201d Johnson said in late February 2019. Brothers implicated, then cleared, in Jussie Smollett case sue actor's legal team for defamation Smollett was arrested on suspicion of filing a false report and released on bond. Prosecutors alleged Smollett texted a friend, one of the brothers, on January 25 and asked to talk. He laid out the plan and rehearsed it, prosecutors said, and gave the friend, Abimbola Osundairo, and his brother, Olabinjo, a $100 bill to buy clothing and rope for a noose and instructed the duo not to bring their phones to the attack. Phone records indicated Smollett talked to the brothers about an hour before the alleged attack and an hour after, authorities said, citing text messages and hours of surveillance video. The Osundairo brothers told police Smollett first \u201cattempted to gain attention by sending a false letter that relied on racial, homophobic and political language,\u201d Johnson said in February 2019. A week before the alleged attack, a letter containing white powder and a drawing of a \u201cstick figure hanging from a tree\u201d was sent to the Chicago set of \u201cEmpire,\u201d police said. Prosecutors said Smollett told Abimbola Osundairo he was disappointed in the \u201cEmpire\u201d team\u2019s reaction to the letter. The powder turned out to be aspirin. After cooperating with police, the two brothers were released without being charged. After his arrest, Smollett apologized to the show\u2019s cast and crew for any embarrassment the allegations may have caused but maintained he was innocent. In March 2019, Smollett was indicted on 16 felony counts of disorderly conduct by a Cook County, Illinois, grand jury. The indictment said that after the alleged attack, Smollett gave statements to both a Chicago police officer and to a detective but that details in those statements were different. Chief prosecutor did not officially recuse herself from Jussie Smollett case, her office says An attorney for Smollett at the time called the indictment a \u201cprosecutorial overkill\u201d and a \u201cdesperate attempt to make headlines,\u201d adding the actor maintained his innocence. On March 14, 2019, Smollett appeared in court and pleaded not guilty. About a week before the charges were announced, Cook County State\u2019s Attorney Kim Foxx removed herself from the case to address potential concerns of impartiality \u201cbased upon familiarity with potential witnesses in this case,\u201d a spokeswoman from her office said. In a dramatic reversal in the case, Chicago prosecutors dropped all charges against Smollett on March 26, 2019. Revealing little about the reason why, the Cook County State\u2019s Attorney\u2019s Office said the decision came after reviewing the case and after the actor agreed to forfeit his $10,000 bond. Parts of the case were sealed, one of Smollett\u2019s attorneys said. \u201cAfter reviewing all of the facts and circumstances of the case, including Mr. Smollett\u2019s volunteer service in the community and agreement to forfeit his bond to the City of Chicago, we believe this outcome is a just disposition and appropriate resolution to this case,\u201d the state\u2019s attorney\u2019s office said in a statement. All of Jussie Smollett's charges have been dropped, but Chicago's mayor still calls his story a hoax First Assistant State\u2019s Attorney Joseph Magats, the lead prosecutor, said Smollett had no prior felonies and was not a danger to the community. He added that thousands of other cases had similar results but that this one stood out in the media because of Smollett\u2019s celebrity. After a brief appearance in a courtroom, Smollett told reporters he was thankful to everyone who stood by him and that he had been \u201ctruthful and consistent on every single level since day one.\u201d His attorney, Patricia Brown, said the two brothers were Smollett\u2019s trainers and that he only paid them for \u201cnutrition and training.\u201d \u201cThis entire situation is a reminder that there should never be an attempt to prove a case in the court of public opinion,\u201d two of the actor\u2019s attorneys said in a statement. \u201cDismissal of charges against the victim in this case was the only just result.\u201d Attorney for brothers involved in the Jussie Smollett case says they were 'betrayed' by the celebrity City officials condemned the dropped charges, with the former Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel calling the case a \u201cwhitewash of justice\u201d that sent a \u201cclear message that if you\u2019re in a position of influence and power, you\u2019ll get treated one way. Other people will be treated another way.\u201d Johnson, the former police superintendent, said he stood by the investigators\u2019 conclusions that Smollett staged the attack, saying the way Smollett could have cleared his name was \u201cin a court of law so that everybody could see the evidence.\u201d In that same month, the city of Chicago said it wanted Smollett to cover the costs of the investigation into his alleged attack \u2013 more than $130,000 \u2013 and gave him a week to do so, kicking off a legal battle after the actor refused to pay. Following news of the dropped charges, Chicago police released a portion of their investigative reports in the case, which shed light on investigators\u2019 interactions with the Osundairo brothers \u2013 including one instance in which one brother told detectives it \u201cfelt good\u201d to tell the truth. After the reports were made public, the police department was \u201cthen advised of a court order prohibiting such release,\u201d then-police spokesman Anthony Guglielmi said in a tweet. Kim Foxx's chief ethics officer and a special prosecutor submit resignations Meanwhile, the Chicago police union called for a federal investigation into Foxx, the state\u2019s attorney for Cook County, to evaluate her involvement in the case following news reports about text messages between her and an attorney about \u201cdiverting the case from Chicago police department to a federal investigation,\u201d Chicago Fraternal Order of Police President Kevin Graham said in March 2019. The following month, Foxx asked the Cook County inspector general to investigate her office\u2019s handling of Smollett\u2019s criminal case, saying that \u201censuring that I and my office have the community\u2019s trust and confidence is paramount to me.\u201d In June 2019, a Cook County circuit judge approved the appointment of a special prosecutor to independently investigate the handling of Smollett\u2019s case. The special prosecutor would have the authority to pursue charges for any crime committed during the investigation \u2013 including further prosecution of Smollett. A federal judge refuses to dismiss Chicago's lawsuit against Jussie Smollett Also in June, Chicago police released body camera footage showing Smollett with a white rope tied in a noose around his neck on the night of the alleged attack. The footage was part of more than 70 hours of video and more than 400 pages of search warrants and some text messages that police released to the media. A judge later ordered Google to turn over a year\u2019s worth of Smollett\u2019s personal electronic data \u2013 including his search history, photographs, files and geolocation data \u2013 to the special prosecutor. Smollett\u2019s publicist declined to comment on the search warrant at the time. Google did not immediately respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment at the time. A grand jury indicted Smollett in February 2020 for making false reports after special prosecutor Dan Webb, assigned to investigate the handling of the actor\u2019s case, said his office \u201ccompleted all of its investigative steps regarding Jussie Smollett, and has made the decision to further prosecute Mr. Smollett.\u201d The indictment charged Smollett with making four separate false reports to Chicago police officers, according to a statement from Webb\u2019s office released at that time. Several factors went into that determination, \u201cincluding the extensive nature of Mr. Smollett\u2019s false police reports, and the resources expended by the Chicago Police Department to investigate these false reports,\u201d Webb said. The special prosecutor\u2019s office also said it had sufficient evidence to \u201cdetermine that it disagrees\u201d with how Foxx\u2019s office handled the case. Webb said in a statement Foxx was unable to provide \u201cdocumentary evidence\u201d showing \u201cother dispositions of similar cases prior to the Smollett case that would justify this disposition.\u201d Foxx, who had admitted fault in her office\u2019s handling of the case and said it could have been more transparent, dismissed Webb\u2019s decision to indict Smollett weeks before the 2020 primary election as political. In November 2020, she won reelection for a second term. Smollett\u2019s attorney, Tina Glandian, said in a statement following the six-count indictment that the earlier charges were appropriately dismissed \u201cbecause they were not supported by the evidence\u201d and said the new attempt to prosecute the actor \u201cis clearly all about politics not justice.\u201d Nearly two weeks later, Glandian entered a not guilty plea on her client\u2019s behalf. The criminal trial began on November 29 and testimony lasted for just over a week. Both the defense and the prosecution called seven witnesses each. The stars of the prosecution\u2019s case were the Osundairo brothers, who were extras on the \u201cEmpire\u201d TV show. They each testified that Smollett directed them and paid them to stage the attack in an attempt to get media attention. Bola Osundairo, who was closer to Smollett, told the court that Smollett \u201cwanted me to fake beat him up.\u201d He said he agreed to do so because he felt indebted to the actor. \u201cI believed he could help further my acting career,\u201d Bola Osundairo testified. \u201cHe told me that we would need another person to fake beat him up. He mentioned could my brother do it. I said yes.\u201d Prosecution rests after brothers testify Jussie Smollett directed them to carry out a fake racist and anti-gay attack His brother Ola Osundairo told jurors that Smollett \u201chad this crazy idea of having two MAGA supporters attack him,\u201d and that he wanted \u201cto put that on social media.\u201d \u201cMr. Smollett asked you to fake attack him?\u201d deputy special prosecutor Sam Mendenhall asked. \u201cYes,\u201d Ola Osundairo responded. \u201cPretending to be Trump supporters?\u201d Mendenhall continued. \u201cYes,\u201d Ola Osundairo said. \u201cSo he could then post it on social media?\u201d the prosecutor continued. \u201cYes,\u201d Ola Osundairo answered. As per their plan, the brothers met Smollett at about 2 a.m. by his apartment during a cold snap known as a \u201cpolar vortex,\u201d they testified. There, as he had instructed, they yelled \u201cEmpire, f****t, n***er, MAGA,\u201d fake punched him, poured bleach on him and put a noose around his neck, they testified. \u201cIf you had not had advanced discussions with Jussie Smollett how would you know where he would be at 2 a.m. in a polar vortex?\u201d special prosecutor Dan Webb asked. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t,\u201d Bola Osundairo responded. Defense rests in Jussie Smollett trial after prosecution contrasts his version of events with other testimony The defense, however, has repeatedly said Smollett was a real victim of an attack. They have suggested that the brothers were motivated by homophobia and/or an attempt to scare Smollett into hiring them as security. Smollett took the stand to lay out his version of events. He emphatically said he did not plan the attack ahead of time and said he paid the brothers $3,500 for training and nutritional advice \u2013 not for any hoax attack. \u201cHave you ever planned a hoax?\u201d his attorney asked. \u201cNever in my life,\u201d Smollett said. He also cast doubt on the brothers\u2019 true motivations. He said he received a \u201chate letter\u201d in the mail at the \u201cEmpire\u201d studio in Chicago on January 22, 2019, seven days before the alleged attack. Afterward, Bola Osundairo approached him about becoming his personal security guard, something Osundairo had repeatedly asked him, Smollett testified. In addition, he testified that he formed a sexual relationship with Bola Osundairo but said he was \u201ccreeped out\u201d by Ola Osundairo. Bola Osundairo denied he had any sexual relationship with Smollett. CNN\u2019s Steve Almasy, Omar Jimenez, Bill Kirkos and Eric Levenson contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "When Danielle Atkinson\u2019s daughter brought home a second-grade assignment that highlighted Christopher Columbus\u2019s explorations, Atkinson said she began to notice inequities in the curriculum being taught in the school district. There were plenty of lessons about Columbus and other historic White figures, but the contributions of Black Americans were largely missing in the coursework at Royal Oak Public Schools in Michigan, she said. Atkinson and other Black and brown parents felt the students weren\u2019t learning enough about the civil rights movement, the Harlem Renaissance, the desegregation of schools and the importance of Black History Month so they formed the Royal Oak Multicultural Parents Association in 2016. They demanded more culturally diverse curriculum from the district, but Atkinson said she\u2019s seen little progress. \u201cOur children are not having the education around race and history that they should, and it\u2019s to our detriment and it\u2019s a disservice to our children,\u201d said the mother of six, who is also founder of the Michigan-based Mothering Justice, a group that advocates for Black and brown moms. Now Atkinson feels like their calls for inclusion are being drowned out by a strong force of conservative, mostly White suburban mothers who have made national headlines for their efforts to ban critical race theory from schools. The largely White group of parents, many of whom have protested and spoken out at riotous school board meetings, helped ignite a national debate about whether anti-Black racism should be taught in America\u2019s public schools. The concept has become a social and political lightening rod with several states banning critical race theory this year and Republicans pledging to make it core to their midterm election strategy. Educators insist that critical race theory \u2013 which acknowledges that racism is both systemic and institutional in American society \u2013 is generally not included in grade school curriculum. The concept is usually taught in law school or graduate school. Critical race theory has become a social and political lightning rod. This is how we got here Many Black parents, meanwhile, don\u2019t see their voices reflected in the national conversation. They too have shown up at school board meetings, formed parent groups to lobby for Black history curriculum, and rallied against the racism their children experience in the classroom. And they are determined to be heard. \u201cMost of our parents left traditionally Black communities (for majority White schools)\u2026 for us to have a better education,\u201d Atkinson said. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t also have to lose our voice and our children\u2019s cultural education because of it.\u201d Some Black parents believe teaching the history of anti-Black racism would help children understand the harm behind it and where it originated. Monica Hutchinson said her child was in second grade at a school in southwest Virginia when a White classmate called them the n-word about 10 years ago. Hutchinson said she was frustrated that a White teacher did not respond in a way that spoke to the gravity of the racial slur or offered enough historical context to the students about why the word should not be used. \u201cI don\u2019t know a Black parent that doesn\u2019t have stories that they can share,\u201d she said. \u201cJust about every Black parent has got them.\u201d Hutchinson argues the grievances about White parents with critical race theory are often elevated at the expense of all other concerns. In Henrico County, Virginia, where Hutchinson\u2019s two younger children now attend public schools, a White mother at a school board meeting last month spoke out against the book \u201cOut of Darkness,\u201d a 2015 historical young adult novel by Ashley Hope P\u00e9rez that depicts a relationship between Mexican American and Black teens. The book explores sex, sexual abuse and racism \u2014 and has been denounced by conservatives as \u201cpornography.\u201d At the request of a school division administrator, the book has now been temporarily removed from high school libraries across the county while a committee reviews the book. \u201cThis is a way for them to stop, or try to prevent the schools from actually teaching, and practicing, equity, diversity and inclusion across the schools,\u201d Hutchsinon said. \u201cI hear a lot of White mothers say they think their child is too young to learn about racism. You know what, my child\u2019s not too young to experience it.\u201d What critical race theory is -- and isn't The pledge to ban critical race theory was a core part of Republican Governor-elect Glenn Youngkin\u2019s successful gubernatorial campaign in Virginia even though the state\u2019s public schools maintain the academic framework is not part of the curriculum. Some political observers say his campaign against critical race theory was key to his victory. In the final days of the race against Democrat Terry McAuliffe, Youngkin featured White conservative activist and mother Laura Murphy lamenting the content of the Toni Morrison Pulitzer Prize-winning novel Beloved, though Murphy did not specifically name the book in the ad. \u201cBeloved\u201d is considered a seminal work of American fiction and centers on the story of Sethe, a former slave and a mother who kills her child to spare her from slavery. Democratic Michigan Sen. Erika Geiss, a mom of two, shared Hutchinson\u2019s sentiments. Earlier this year, Geiss said she voted against the bill proposed to a Senate committee by Republican Michigan Sen. Lana Theis to ban critical race theory from schools. While the bill was approved by the committee, it is awaiting a full Senate vote, Geiss said. Geiss said conservatives have created a \u201cboogeyman\u201d around teaching critical race theory as if they refuse to acknowledge the country\u2019s past sins. The enslavement of Black people, Geiss said, had a systemic impact on race relations that fueled redlining, the Black maternal health crisis and many other inequities. Children need to learn this so they don\u2019t repeat the wrongdoings of American history, she said. \u201cWe (Black parents) are the ones who when a child calls our kid a slave we have to pick up those pieces and wipe those tears,\u201d Geiss said. \u201cWhen (teaching race) is framed as only an issue that White parents have, they are missing an entire fragment of the population.\u201d Some experts and activists say placing the spotlight on White suburban moms and critical race theory could potentially weaken other movements traditionally led by Black mothers. Jennifer R. Farmer, a prominent publicist who authored a self-help book \u201cFirst & Only\u201d for Black professional women this year, said if she were advising Democrats on counter messaging on critical race theory, she would tell them to \u201cget resources to grassroots groups who are already working on education and equity.\u201d There were 155 efforts to censor books in US schools and libraries, group says For example, Farmer said there have been organizations such as the Advancement Project led by Black mothers to address the school to prison pipeline, which is the link between the disproportionate number of Black minors who receive harsh punishment in schools like suspensions and expulsions who ultimately end up incarcerated. \u201cYou can\u2019t have progress on these issues without talking about race,\u201d Farmer said. Judith Browne Dianis, executive director of the Advancement Project, said Black women and Black educators have always fought for racial justice for youth as well as more inclusive curriculum. But the movement of mostly White moms against critical race theory has become more politicized, particularly leading into the 2022 midterms. \u201cWe know that a school culture that is inclusive is important in ensuring that young people are in an environment that is nurturing and where they are not subject to the school to prison pipeline,\u201d Dianis said. \u201cAnd so there\u2019s like these connections to what could become of our school when these conversations about race and racism and Black history, if they get erased from the school building?\u201d",

            "article_content": "The Milwaukee County district attorney whose office sought low bail leading to the release of the man accused of running over holiday paradegoers in a nearby suburb has been a longtime champion of efforts to reduce mass incarceration by using the discretion afforded prosecutors. Darrell E. Brooks, 39, of Milwaukee, now faces murder charges after authorities said he killed six people and wounded more than 60 others by driving through the Waukesha Christmas parade on Sunday. Brooks was out on bail for two separate allegations of violence, including one where he is accused of using a car to run over a woman less than three weeks earlier. Milwaukee prosecutor John Chisholm\u2019s office released a statement Monday morning, saying his office erred in seeking bail of $1,000 in the most recent case involving violent allegations against Brooks. He posted bail about a week after he was charged and was released from custody. More than a dozen remain hospitalized after deadly Waukesha parade crash \u201cThe State\u2019s bail recommendation in this case was inappropriately low in light of the nature of the recent charges and the pending charges against Mr. Brooks,\u201d according to the statement. \u201cThe bail recommendation in this case is not consistent with the approach of the Milwaukee County District Attorney\u2019s Office toward matters involving violent crime, nor was it consistent with the risk assessment of the defendant prior to setting of bail.\u201d The statement from Chisholm\u2019s office said they were \u201cconducting an internal review of the decision to make the recent bail recommendation.\u201d State law sets out factors for judges to consider in setting bail amounts, including whether someone\u2019s likely to return to court and whether they\u2019re likely to hurt other people, said Julie Rendelman, a former prosecutor of homicides who\u2019s now a defense attorney. One of the charges Brooks faced earlier this month was for not returning to court, and another was for an allegation of violence. \u201cIt looks like they just screwed up,\u201d Rendelman said. \u201cThey dropped the ball, it really is that simple. I don\u2019t think it speaks to bail reform.\u201d Prosecutors across the country this year have confronted a logistical challenge caused by the pandemic, balancing the need to move cases through the system with the risks of exposure that comes with defendants going to court and jail. Officials have sought ways to keep defendants out of the system while still respecting the serious nature of allegations against defendants; in some jurisdictions it\u2019s led to lower-than-normal bail requests or bail amounts in order to keep defendants out of jail. In some cases, those requests dovetail with prosecutor offices whose approach to defendants is more lenient than prosecutors have been for decades. It\u2019s not clear what role that may have played here. Chisholm took office in 2007 after working for years as a prosecutor and holding a senior position under his predecessor, E. Michael McCann, who held that office for 38 years. McCann endorsed Chisholm as a successor in 2006. Chisholm ran unopposed in 2020. In an interview in 2015 with The New Yorker\u2019s Jeffrey Toobin, a current CNN legal analyst, Chisholm said 10% of 15% of cases prosecutors handle were for homicide and gun crimes. The rest were for less serious crime \u2013 the difference between \u201cpeople who scare us\u201d and \u201cpeople who irritate the hell out of us,\u201d he said. Waukesha parade crash suspect appeared to have no emotion as officers tried to stop him, authorities say \u201cThe most important thing we can do with those people is incapacitate them, so they can\u2019t do any more harm,\u201d he told Toobin. Part of his approach was reducing the number of people Milwaukee County was sending to state prison for low-level drug offenses, but attempts to reduce racial disparities in prosecution and sentencing have been complicated by the racial makeup of violent crime victims and offenders, Chisholm said. \u201cWe\u2019re no longer sending low-level drug offenders to state prison, but we are still sending violent criminals, and that\u2019s keeping the African-American numbers up,\u201d Chisholm told Toobin. \u201cIf we do this right, the people who are going to prison should be going to prison. The people who are going to prison are dangerous.\u201d After he won election in 2006, Chisholm told the Milwaukee Journal-Sentinel the next year that it was \u201cguaranteed\u201d that someone his office diverted from jail would go on to kill someone. \u201cIs there going to be an individual I divert, or I put into treatment program, who\u2019s going to go out and kill somebody?\u201d Chisholm told the\u202f Journal Sentinel. \u201cYou bet. Guaranteed. It\u2019s guaranteed to happen. It does not invalidate the overall approach.\u201d Chishom\u2019s office did not respond to CNN\u2019s requests for comment. The term \u201cbail reform\u201d has loosely been used to describe any policy that results in a lower threshold for holding accused criminals in jail before they\u2019re tried before a judge or jury, or before they plead out or prosecutors drop charges. It\u2019s not clear that reform efforts were to blame here: Chisholm\u2019s previous statements have made a distinction between people accused of violence and accused of lower-level crimes. Brooks isn\u2019t alleged to have committed violence while being out on low bail for a non-violent offense. Behind police leaders claims that bail reform is responsible for surge in violence Chisholm was first elected before two instances of police use of force triggered nationwide protests and led to so-called progressive candidates running for election in local prosecutor races. Policies favored by progressive prosecutors are sometimes a sore spot for those in law enforcement, who frame them as being soft on crime. In Chicago over the summer, the city\u2019s police superintendent took issue with a federal judge releasing someone accused of supplying the gun used to kill a Chicago police officer. \u201cIt\u2019s an outrage,\u201d Chicago Police Superintendent David Brown said. \u201cWhen I heard this afternoon that a federal judge had released the man who illegally purchased and then supplied the gun used to murder\u202fOfficer Ella French, I could not believe it.\u201d The issue of reform emerges whenever someone accused of a violent crime that garners significant attention also has a history in the criminal justice system, like Brooks. The significant increase in homicides across America in 2020, and the continuing of that trend in some major cities, has led to more debate. \u201cYou can\u2019t pin cash bail to the spike in violent crime because, for one thing, cash bail affects mainly low-level non-violent offenders,\u201d Jody Armour, a professor of law at the University of Southern California, told CNN over the summer. How crime stats lie \u2014 and what you need to know to understand them \u201cA judge has to make a determination at court ahead of time that the person is safe to reenter society before they can even get cash bail,\u201d he added. Chisholm has said his office should focus on keeping violent people in the system and non-violent people out; Brooks was accused of violence and a prosecutor still sought low bail. It\u2019s not clear why the state sought low bail or why the judge granted the request. In that case, from early November, Brooks is accused of running over a woman with his car while she was walking through a gas station parking lot, leaving tire tracks on her left pants leg. He was charged with recklessly endangering safety, felony bail jumping, battery to a police officer, obstructing an officer and disorderly conduct, according to a statement from the district attorney\u2019s office. His bail jumping charge stemmed from an incident in July 2020. Brooks had made bail on a gun charge earlier this year, in February, according to the statement. Rendelman said prosecutors often have a cheat sheet they use to determine their bail requests, and she said it was unlikely that any bail request guide would suggest $1,000 was appropriate to request considering the allegations of both violence and not showing up for court. \u201cThis case seems different because he has lengthy history, has indications that he\u2019s not going to come back to court, and the case being brought against him, the allegations are extremely violent,\u201d she said. Fact-checking claims bail reform is driving increase in violent crime During a congressional hearing in late June, Sen. Lindsey Graham, a South Carolina Republican, suggested reforms eliminating cash bail could partially be to blame for the summer violence increase. Graham asked FBI Director Christopher Wray if he believed \u201cone of the reasons crime is on the rise is that certain jurisdictions have basically eliminated bail?\u201d Prosecutors have wide discretion in arguing for high or low bail amounts for defendants facing trial, though it\u2019s usually up to a judge to decide. Prosecutors also make those choices locally \u2013 prosecutors in one county might not prosecute a low-level drug offense while prosecutors two counties away seek years of jail time for the same allegation. It\u2019s not clear whether, or how, bail reform efforts are tied to the increase in violent crime, if at all. There\u2019s wide disagreement between law enforcement and academia over how much it\u2019s connected. Studies on certain jurisdictions, such as the county encompassing Chicago, disagree on whether cash bail can be linked to any increase in crime. Two studies from the University of Utah and Loyola University Chicago came to opposite conclusions on whether the bail reform in Cook County led to an increase in crime in the county. These studies of Cook County are a clear example of how researchers disagree\u202f on methodology in studying the effects of bail reform and increases in crime.

            "article_content": "The Brute. The Buck. And, of course, the Thug. Those are just some of the names for a racial stereotype that has haunted the collective imagination of White America since the nation\u2019s inception. The specter of the angry Black man has been evoked in politics and popular culture to convince White folks that a big, bad Black man is coming to get them and their daughters. I\u2019ve seen viral videos of innocent Black men losing their lives because of this stereotype. I\u2019ve watched White people lock their car doors or clutch their purses when men who look like me approach. I\u2019ve been racially profiled. It\u2019s part of the psychological tax you pay for being a Black man in America \u2013 learning to accept that you are seen by many as Public Enemy No. 1. But as I\u2019ve watched three separate trials about White male violence unfold across the US these past few weeks \u2013 the Kyle Rittenhouse trial, the Ahmaud Arbery death trial and the civil case against organizers of the 2017 Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville \u2013 I\u2019ve come to a sobering conclusion: There is nothing more frightening in America today than an angry White man. It\u2019s not the \u201cradical Islamic terrorist\u201d that I fear the most. Nor is it the brown immigrant or the fiery Black Lives Matter protester, or whatever the latest bogeyman is that some politician tells me I should dread. It\u2019s encountering an armed White man in public who has been inspired by the White men on trial in these three cases. Here\u2019s what legal experts say helped acquit Kyle Rittenhouse I\u2019m not suggesting we start racially profiling White men. The vast majority of White men are no menace to society. Countless White men swallowed tear gas and braved rubber bullets while marching with demonstrators during last year\u2019s protests over the murder of George Floyd. Plenty of White men \u2013 like the Rev. James Reeb, a White Unitarian minister \u2013 died for Black people during the civil rights movement. There is nothing inherently violent about White men, or any human being. But recent events have convinced me it\u2019s time to put another character on trial: A vision of White masculinity that allows some White men to feel as if they \u201ccan rule and brutalize without consequence.\u201d This angry White man has been a major character throughout US history. He gave the country slavery, the slaughter of Native Americans, and Jim Crow laws. His anger also helped fuel the January 6 insurrection at the Capitol. It\u2019s this angry White man \u2013 not the Black or brown man you see approaching on the street at night \u2013 who poses the most dangerous threat to democracy in America. That\u2019s a sweeping claim. But these trials represent something bigger than questions of individual guilt or innocence. They offer a disturbing vision of the future, and a choice about what kind of country we want to live in. The facts of the trials are well known to many Americans. In Wisconsin, a jury found Kyle Rittenhouse not guilty of all charges in the shooting deaths of two men and the wounding of another during a racial protest last year. Rittenhouse, who was 17 at the time, said he was in Kenosha during the protests after the police shooting of Jacob Blake to help protect property. He said he shot the men in self-defense. In Georgia, three White men are accused of chasing and killing Ahmaud Arbery, a 25-year-old Black man, last year while he was jogging. The men say they were trying to conduct a lawful citizen\u2019s arrest, and the man who shot Arbery says he acted in self-defense. And in Virginia, a civil trial is underway to determine if organizers of the \u201cUnite the Right\u201d rally intended to incite racial violence. One person was killed and dozens injured there after White supremacists clashed with counter-demonstrators. Race is an inescapable theme that runs through all the trials. At the center of each are White men who are accused of using unjustified violence, either against an unarmed Black man or during racial protests. In Rittenhouse\u2019s case, a jury cleared him of criminal wrongdoing. It\u2019s what\u2019s happening outside these courtrooms, though, that is most frightening. It suggests these trials are a symptom of a dangerous shift. If there was an Exhibit A to describe this shift, it might be an anim\u00e9 video. Earlier this month, Republican Rep. Paul Gosar posted a photoshopped anim\u00e9 video to his Twitter and Instagram accounts showing him attacking President Joe Biden and appearing to kill Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez with a sword. The House voted this week to censure Gosar, with virtually no Republicans backing the resolution. Gosar took down the video after facing criticism but did not apologize, and later retweeted a post that contained the video. Gosar\u2019s video wasn\u2019t an isolated incident. Violent political rhetoric has been escalating among some members of the Republican Party. And while not all of it is fueled by White men, much of it starts at the top \u2013 with former President Donald Trump. Trump\u2019s violent and sexist rhetoric has been well-documented. More White men now identify as Republican, and the gender gap between both major parties is as large as it\u2019s ever been in the last two decades. One New York Times columnist, under the headline \u201cThe Angry White Male Caucus,\u201d said this anger is driven by White men who fear a changing America \u201cin which the privilege of being a white man isn\u2019t what it used to be.\u201d The anger also seems to be getting worse. After President Joe Biden signed an infrastructure bill into law this month, some House Republicans who voted for it reported receiving death threats. Election officials and school board members across the country are also reporting escalating threats.  A recent poll revealed that 30% of Republicans believe that violence is justified to save the country. Political violence is not limited to the GOP. A Bernie Sanders supporter who publicly declared his hatred of conservatives shot five people at a Republican baseball practice in 2017. But talking about assaulting and killing political enemies has become so normal \u2013 and seemingly acceptable \u2013 in conservative circles today that a White man felt comfortable enough to ask a right-wing activist at a public forum in Idaho last month: \u201cWhen do we get to use the guns? \u2026 How many elections are they going to steal before we kill these people?\u201d Add to this toxic political atmosphere another element: Laws that not only protect White vigilante violence but, in some cases, seem to embolden vigilantes. Activists hoped that widely seen videos showing White police officers and White men shooting Black men like Arbery would inspire the courts and state legislatures to revisit laws that made such actions possible. But even after nationwide protests over the murder of George Floyd by a White police officer, little has changed. A growing number of Americans now want police funding increased. And though Georgia overhauled its citizen\u2019s arrest law, a reform bill called the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act died in Congress two months ago. The conservative-leaning US Supreme Court now seems poised to make it easier for people to carry guns in public, based on recent oral arguments over a New York gun control law. The US\u2019 civilian population is already the most heavily armed in the world. And our streets could soon become even more violent. \u201cA significant portion of the gun safety movement\u2019s current agenda is likely to come under attack in the coming years,\u201d Adam Winkler, a UCLA law professor and author of \u201cGunfight: The Battle Over the Right to Bear Arms in America,\u201d recently told Newsweek. \u201cI think bans on assault weapons and bans on high-capacity magazines are ripe for the new Supreme Court, with its newly invigorated Second Amendment, to strike down.\u201d The Supreme Court has also recently ruled once again in favor of \u201cqualified immunity,\u201d the legal doctrine that shields police officers accused of misconduct. There\u2019s been little national movement on reforming \u201cstand your ground laws,\u201d some of which allow people who believe they\u2019re facing an imminent threat to use lethal force without first trying to escape. At least 25 states have such laws, according to the National Conference of State Legislators. And despite the shocking nature of the Arbery video, there\u2019s been little progress on reforming citizen\u2019s arrest laws, which allow private citizens to detain or arrest someone they suspect in a crime. The White men on trial in the Rittenhouse and Arbery cases both said they acted in self-defense. One of the men in the Arbery case testified that the unarmed Black jogger tried to take his gun, and his life was at risk. But consider the potential danger of other White men \u2013 or any person wielding a gun in public \u2013 feeling emboldened to use deadly force against even an unarmed person by evoking the logic in those defenses, said Eric Ruben, a Second Amendment expert. \u201cIn other words, their own decision to carry a gun became a justification to use it, lest it be wrested away from them,\u201d Ruben recently told the New York Times. While prosecutors didn\u2019t show that Rittenhouse was angry that night, there is a perception \u2013 fair or not \u2013 that he went to Kenosha for reasons more than simply maintaining public safety. The comedian Trevor Noah reflected this sentiment in a comment that became a meme: \u201cNo one has ever thought, \u2018Oh, it\u2019s my solemn duty to pick up a rifle and protect that TJ Maxx.\u201d And finally, there\u2019s a growing fear that no one will be severely punished for the January 6 insurrection because most of the rioters were White. The trials of various defendants are winding their way through the courts now. Jacob Chansley, the so-called \u201cQAnon Shaman,\u201d was sentenced to 41 months in prison for his role in the US Capitol riot. But many believe the punishment will never match the severity of the crime. What if, say, a mob of Black Lives Matter protesters attacked the US Capitol in an attempt to overturn the election of a Republican president? How do you think conservative lawmakers would react? We are seeing more threats, more guns and more suspicion that the courts will go easy on White people who employ violence. This is the combustible mix that makes more violence almost inevitable. We have enough problems with White male violence as it is. Mass shootings in the US are committed more often by White men than by any other group. Top law enforcement officials now say the nation\u2019s biggest domestic terror threat comes from White supremacists. And many of the most indelible news images of recent years include angry, red-faced White men, often armed with guns. Consider scenes from the US Capitol riot, which were filled with angry White men wielding crude weapons and pummeling police. Or the snarling faces of young White men holding tiki torches during the 2017 rally in Charlottesville. Or the angry White men who clashed with anti-racist protesters across the US last year. White male anger has become one of the most potent political forces in contemporary America. That anger helped a White man win the White House. Trump\u2019s rise to power is inconceivable without his ability to tap into White male anger and embody it. Has there ever been an angrier modern president? He is the White male id unleashed. This White male anger is causing many people \u2013 including other White men \u2013 to look over their shoulder when they go out in public. The two men who were shot and killed by Rittenhouse in Wisconsin were White, as was the man he wounded. Ijeoma Oluo, author of \u201cMediocre: The Dangerous Legacy of White Male America,\u201d wrote that she lives with the constant fear that angry White men will turn violent toward her and \u201ccountless other black people, brown people, disabled people, queer people, trans people, and women of every demographic.\u201d White male anger could prove to be one of the biggest roadblocks we face in building a successful multiracial democracy. Lee Drutman, a scholar who has studied political violence, recently told the New York Times: \u201cI have a hard time seeing how we have a peaceful 2024 election after everything that\u2019s happened now. I don\u2019t see the rhetoric turning down, I don\u2019t see the conflicts going away. I really do think it\u2019s hard to see how it gets better before it gets worse.\u201d This isn\u2019t hyperbole. It\u2019s history. It happened before. After the Civil War, the US attempted to build the first biracial democracy by incorporating formerly enslaved people into the country\u2019s political and economic life. That period, known as Reconstruction, was destroyed primarily by the violence of White men who used terrorist and vigilante groups like the KKK to assassinate elected officials, prevent Blacks from voting and overthrow state governments. In 1898, for example, a mob of primarily White men staged a coup against the city government of Wilmington, North Carolina, which had elected a multiracial coalition of leaders. More than 60 Black people were killed, and Black residents of the city were barred from voting, and from elected office, for decades afterward. The January 6 insurrection wasn\u2019t unprecedented. In many ways it was a sequel. Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham warned the GOP that \u201cWe\u2019re not generating enough angry White guys to stay in business for the long term.\u201d He was wrong. The angry White guy business is booming. Yet no matter how obvious it becomes that the country has a problem with White male violence, most Americans will escape what Black and brown men experience on a weekly basis. Not many drivers will lock their doors when White men approach at a stoplight. Few women will clutch their purse when they pass a White man on the street. Someone recently posted a meme about this double standard by evoking the memory of Tamir Rice, the 12-year-old Black boy who was killed in Cleveland by a police officer who authorities said mistook his toy pistol for a real firearm. \u201cTamir Rice was 12 and killed for having a fake toy gun. Kyle Rittenhouse, 17, killed two people. Walked by police after killing two people. Got to go home and sleep.\u201d That meme is why it\u2019s hard for me for to tolerate hearing another lecture about \u201cBlack thug culture\u201d or a \u201cBlack culture of violence.\u201d My response to the White men who use these tired phrases: Look in the mirror. And look at these three trials, because they point to one frightening future. This is what that future looks like: More angry White men emboldened by \u201cstand your ground\u201d and citizen\u2019s arrest laws, inspired by a conservative interpretation of the Second Amendment. And more dead Americans.",

            "article_content": "Joshua Halsey was murdered in the November 1898 massacre of Black people in Wilmington, North Carolina, by White supremacists. On Saturday, 123 years later, Halsey was honored with a funeral. Halsey\u2019s unmarked grave is the first identified of the victims \u2013 thought to be more than 100 by the Third Person Project, a historical research group. There could be as many as 250 victims, John Jeremiah Sullivan, who worked with the project, told CNN. It was the tireless efforts by the project to locate the unmarked graves and no small amount of sleuthing \u2013 not just combing through a Black cemetery\u2019s records \u2013 that led to the discovery. That\u2019s after a state report in 1998 \u2013 the 100th anniversary of the massacre \u2013 identified two of the victims of the massacre: Halsey and Samuel McFarland. A century after the Tulsa race massacre, 'you still have a community that's struggling' Elaine Cynthia Brown, a Halsey descendent, said the discovery was \u201csurreal\u2019 for the family. \u201cWe were in shock, because this is so unprecedented,\u201d Brown told CNN. \u201cBut then we said, \u2018You know what? Why not Joshua?\u2019\u201d \u201cWhy not be the beacon of what can happen when we sort of unearth the truth, uncover the truth and unpack it?\u201d Brown said. \u201cYou know, this is where it\u2019s going to start and the stories are going to come out as more victims are found, and we hear their stories. But we now know that it exists. We now know that we can change it. We now are getting the true history of what happened here.\u201d At the time of the massacre, Wilmington \u2013 like Tulsa, Oklahoma, before the massacre there \u2013 had a thriving Black community that had formed a building and loan association, built libraries. They \u201cwere employed in all segments of the workforce, as professionals, skilled artisans, government employees, maritime crew members, industrial workers, laborers and domestics,\u201d the 1898 Wilmington Race Riot Commission found. Black people were even part of the city\u2019s government that White supremacists set out to destroy. Shortly after the Democratic Party \u2013 the party of White supremacy at the time \u2013  won the county\u2019s election by intimidating Black voters and tampering with the returns, according to the commission, armed White men burned down The Daily Record, Wilmington\u2019s Black newspaper and then began attacking Black people. \u201cOn the same day, local elected officials were forced to resign, and were replaced by white supremacist leaders,\u201d according to a timeline of the events by the North Carolina Department of Natural and Cultural Resources. It is often cited by historians as the only violent coup d\u2019etat in the United States. The massacre forever changed Wilmington\u2019s culture. \u201cThe events of the 1898 coup marked a turning point in the post-Reconstruction South that changed the trajectory of race relations in North Carolina and marked the start of Jim Crow laws in the state, which further enforced racial segregation through the mid-20th century,\u201d according to a guide of the events published by the  William Madison Randall Library of the University of North Carolina Wilmington. The ceremony is part of series of events planned from November 1 to 10 by the county, the city of Wilmington and several organizations to commemorate the massacre and honor its victims. On Saturday, a horse-drawn hearse carried to the funeral soil collected from the site of Halsey\u2019s home. Rev. William Barber II of the Poor People\u2019s Campaign \u2013 a social justice movement inspired by Martin Luther King Jr. \u2013  gave the eulogy, surrounded by several of Halsey\u2019s descendents and a crowd of people, both Black and White. \u201cWe must find the vestiges of systemic racism that are still happening today and that are still going on today,\u201d Barber said. \u201cAnd we must call them out in Joshua\u2019s name. I\u2019m here to tell you that what killed Joshua is still alive today.\u201d Gwendolyn Alexis, a great granddaughter of Halsey\u2019s, teaches African American history, including the Wilmington massacre, but she had no idea she was connected to one of its victims. \u201cAnd when I found out that my great grandfather was killed, one of the people killed, it took my breath away,\u201d Alexis told CNN. \u201cBecause not only did I find family, I found history,\u201d and it made it much more real, she said. Though this has been painful, it\u2019s also an opportunity for change, Halsey\u2019s descendents said. \u201cTruth is always difficult to talk about, but the more you talk about it, the more it is, you know what I mean?\u201d Brown said. \u201cThe more you can accept it, the more you can change things, instead of it repeating.\u201d \u201cSo we have to tell the the truth, talk about it and then find ways to deal with this,\u201d she said. \u201cSo this sort of thing doesn\u2019t happen again.\u201d Correction: An earlier version of this story had the wrong last name for John Jeremiah Sullivan.",

            "article_content": "Anti-police candidates and a policing overhaul referendum were rejected on Election Day in Seattle, Minneapolis and Buffalo, continuing a trend of voters and public officials choosing moderate and measured approaches to policing over sweeping or radical changes. The debate over every issue related to law enforcement has played out in city councils and state legislatures across the country since George Floyd died under the knee of a Minneapolis police officer last spring, setting off the largest protest movement in American history. Buffalo Mayor Byron Brown declares victory over socialist challenger Protests and unrest in response to Floyd\u2019s death have shaped local and national politics since. A policy favored by protesters was cutting spending on law enforcement, with proposals that ranged from gradual shift of law enforcement funding to social services to outright abolition of police departments and the role police play in America. In cities where \u201cdefunding the police\u201d was up for discussion on Tuesday, voters rejected the notion. Since Floyd\u2019s murder, reform to law enforcement has been more tailored to local concerns. The set of circumstances Tuesday and the role of safety in the election reflected a \u201chierarchy of needs situation,\u201d said Mark A. Smith, professor of politics at the University of Washington. Without dependable public safety, \u201cit\u2019s hard to have a lot of the other things,\u201d he said. \u201cWhen you don\u2019t have it or feel it slipping away, you\u2019re probably going to leap there as a first response.\u201d In Buffalo, the sitting mayor was reelected by a write-in campaign after he lost the Democratic primary to a \u201cdefund the police\u201d socialist, and Seattle voters elected a mayor who pressed for more officers over a candidate who pledged to slash police spending in half. In Minneapolis voters rejected a plan that would have opened the door to a sweeping law  enforcement overhaul by eliminating the city police minimum staffing requirement and giving the city council greater control of law enforcement efforts. They also reelected the city\u2019s mayor, who refused to commit to abolishing the police. Instead, he said he wanted to ensure an integrated approach to public safety, hire more community-oriented officers, build safety beyond policing, and get serious about reform on a \u201cmulti-jurisdictional level.\u201d Historic wins in cities across the US and a backlash in Virginia. This week's elections, explained Republicans used \u201cdefund\u201d to paint Democrats as soft on crime, and President Joe Biden told Georgia Democrats that Republicans used \u201cdefund the police\u201d to \u201cbeat the living hell\u201d out of Democrats in November elections last year. Prominent Democrats have since called \u201cdefund the police\u201d a mistake. \u201cThat sentiment has proven to be pretty unpopular across the country,\u201d Smith said. \u201cEven in Minneapolis, the site of Derek Chauvin killing George Floyd, it couldn\u2019t even pass there. \u201cYou could tell even in 2020 some of the disorder, homelessness, rising murder rates, people were noticing that and looking for an outlet in how to express it,\u201d he said. \u201cIn a situation of rising disorder and crime and other associated problems, the more law-and-order-ish candidate is going to probably have an advantage.\u201d In cities and states all over, elected officials have taken slower or less sweeping steps that don\u2019t drastically alter the role of law enforcement in America since Floyd\u2019s death. Tuesday\u2019s election results were a continuation of that trend. In some states, attorneys general are conducting investigations into local police departments modeled after federal pattern-and-practice investigations that look for ways to reform policing. Some cities are looking to alter or limit the role of police in calls relating to mental health or substance abuse. Even Democrats are now admitting 'Defund the Police' was a massive mistake Mayors, city councils, governors, and state legislatures have all had opportunity to dismantle, defund, or otherwise overhaul policing through budgets or other normal government deliberations. Few public officials were as vocal as those in Minneapolis, where nine of the city\u2019s 13 city councilors pledged to dismantle the police department last summer after a week of protests and unrest in the city. Voters there had their first chance to weigh in on a concrete policing proposal on Tuesday: a ballot measure that would have made it easier for the city council to overhaul policing by eliminating a staffing requirement and giving the council executive control of the police. Minneapolis residents rejected the measure by a 12-point margin and reelected Jacob Frey, the city\u2019s mayor, who opposed the plan to dismantle the police department. The ballot measure itself was the product of more than a year of litigation and other bureaucratic fighting and didn\u2019t go as far as elected officials had promised. That was a city where there was wide agreement among city officials that policing needed some change. \u201cI think part of it is some reality testing,\u201d said Chuck Wexler, director of the non-partisan Police Executive Research Forum. \u201cPeople are saying look, we want to change the police, but you know we also got a violent crime issue, we have a domestic violence issue \u2026 then there\u2019s a need to reform American police departments. I think you can do that, but I think what people are saying is, let\u2019s do it in a responsible way, let\u2019s involve the community, let\u2019s educate the police, let\u2019s hire better, let\u2019s train better, let\u2019s supervise better, but at the same time you\u2019ve got a significant crime issue and you can\u2019t ignore that.\u201d The mayoral race in Seattle was between two candidates who were both city councilors, were both racial minorities, had similar funding, and had similar name recognition going into the race, Smith said. Where they differed was policing. Seattle saw a spike in homicides last year after the protests and unrest in late May and early June. This year\u2019s total, through the first half of the year, matched last year\u2019s. Seattle, like other West Coast cities, has seen an increase in homelessness and some public parks taken over by homeless encampments. And in June and July last year, protestors took over a six-block area of the city calledthe \u201cCapitol Hill Autonomous Zone.\u201d It followed protests, unrest and looting in Seattle and elsewhere after Floyd\u2019s death. Mayoral candidate Lorena Gonzalez was one of seven to support cutting Seattle police spending by 50 percent. Bruce Harrell was not. Police chiefs are leaving departments at a higher rate than previous years \u201cIt\u2019s as clean a test as you normally get of candidates\u2019 messages and platforms and Gonzalez and Harrel are running on different things,\u201d Smith, the professor, said. \u201cIt\u2019s pretty clear Harrell\u2019s message was far more appealing.\u201d The mayoral election in Seattle wasn\u2019t the only one where policing was central to the race \u2013 voters there have nearly elected a Republican city attorney over a public defender opposed to prosecuting most misdemeanor charges. The projected losing candidate, Nicole Thomas-Kennedy, had also called officers \u201cpigs\u201d and \u201cserial killers,\u201d and her campaign manager called the city\u2019s police chief \u2013 a Black woman \u2013 an \u201cUncle Tom (expletive).\u201d \u201cEven in Seattle where Republicans are not popular \u2026 between a Republican or Nicole Thomas-Kennedy, Seattle said we\u2019ll take the Republican and that\u2019s remarkable,\u201d Smith said. In Buffalo, Mayor Byron Brown declared victory on Tuesday in his campaign for a fifth term against Democratic Socialist India Walton, who won the primary earlier this year. Walton, who secured 41% of the votes, had called for redirecting $7.5 million from the Buffalo Police Department\u2019s budget. Brown has accused Walton of seeking to defund the police \u2013 a term that she has distanced herself from. Walton\u2019s public safety policy agenda was geared toward addressing the root causes of violence rather than heavier policing and punishment after violence occurs, according to her agenda. She describes her approach as \u201cevidence-based, data-driven, and founded on proven practices in Buffalo and elsewhere.\u201d In an interview with CNN before early voting began, Brown said the stakes would be \u201cdire and extreme\u201d if Walton were elected, adding that she would \u201ctake our city horribly back. She would compromise our public safety.\u201d Scott Phillips, an associate professor in the Criminal Justice Department at SUNY Buffalo State, told CNN there isn\u2019t a clear measure of whether Walton was defeated because of her public safety agenda or her Democratic Socialist label \u2013 but it\u2019s possible that her policing policies \u201chad a big role to play.\u201d \u201cWhen you say you\u2019re going to reduce the size of the police department that, like many other cities, is having problems with shootings and homicides, that\u2019s going to be scary for people,\u201d Phillips said. According to Phillips, Walton was not clear enough in her message with regards to the purpose and goals behind some of her policing policies to help the public understand how the changes would affect them, including the downsizing of the police department. State AGs are 'stepping into the police reform business' to hold officers accountable \u201cShe wasn\u2019t explaining these, assumed to be, drastic shifts in how the police would perform their tasks. You don\u2019t have to be a police officer to scratch your head and say, \u2018that doesn\u2019t make any sense.\u2019 A standard citizen is going to say the same thing,\u201d Phillips said. \u201cIn the effort to improve policing, there has to be a much greater debate and discussion regarding what they are talking about.\u202fThe bumper sticker arguments are never going to get you where you want to go,\u201d Phillips added. \u201cAnd so, while the police need reforms, need to be improved, without a deeper understanding of what the research tells us about this stuff, you\u2019re not going to get a successful policy.\u201d Voters in New York City\u2019s Democratic primary chose Eric Adams, a former police officer, as its Democratic candidate for mayor over the summer. His election Tuesday in the general election was widely expected. That city, like most other major American cities, saw a spike in homicides last year and into this year. Smith said there were two issues: one was recognizing problematic use of force by police across the country, the other a question of whether defunding is the proper policy response. \u201cI think (Harrell) probably is hitting the sweet spot. We need police reform, accountability, better training, respect toward citizens. That message paired with, we\u2019re not going to defund, we\u2019re going to have effective, well trained and compensated police,\u201d Smith said. \u201cBut we still need police. That\u2019s the sweet spot. Broadly, that was (Harrell)\u2019s message. Broadly that was Adams\u2019 message. That\u2019s just what\u2019s going to get the largest number of voters.\u201d CNN\u2019s Gregory Krieg contributed to this report.",

Much has happened since, but the consequences of that day continue to reverberate. Here\u2019s a look at the impact of this anniversary, plus everything else you need to Get Up to Speed and On with Your Day. (You can also get \u201c5 Things You Need to Know Today\u201d delivered to your inbox daily. Sign up here.) The House committee investigating the January 6 Capitol riot is trying to move quickly as members face growing concern that their work would be shut down if the 2022 midterm elections result in a Republican-led House. The panel was in court yesterday to fight former President Trump\u2019s efforts to withhold documents about what happened in the White House on the day of the insurrection. Today, the committee is scheduled to hear from Jeffrey Clark, a former Justice Department official who pushed baseless election conspiracy theories and consulted with Trump before the insurrection. Rep. Bennie Thompson, the chair of the select committee, says about 20 more subpoenas are expected\u00a0to go out soon. What\u2019s happening today: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has announced several events at the Capitol that will commemorate today\u2019s anniversary, including a prayer, a moment of silence on the House floor and a conversation led by two historians aimed at preserving narratives of the attack. Lawmakers will also share their accounts, and President Joe Biden is expected to deliver remarks later today. Global warming could be kept to 1.8 degrees Celsius above pre-industrial levels if all the pledges and promises made at the COP26 summit in Glasgow are kept, the International Energy Agency reports. Scientists have said warming needs to be kept to 1.5 degrees or below to avoid the most disastrous climate consequences, but 1.8 degrees is still big news given that the Earth is currently careening toward a 2.7-degree rise. The UK government announced that 23 more countries made commitments to phase out coal power. But some of the biggest greenhouse gas emitters \u2013 namely China, India and the US \u2013 did not sign on. All in all, the international vows fall short of what experts say is needed to reach net-zero coal emissions by 2050. The CDC has updated its recommendations for the Pfizer/BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine booster to include children as young as 12, at least five months after they finish their primary set of shots. Separately, a bipartisan groups of senators floated the idea of more Covid-19 relief as event cancellations, closures and travel woes pile up due to skyrocketing Omicron cases. However, the talks failed to move forward. Europe could face 500,000 more Covid-19 deaths this winter, the World Health Organization warns. The agency raised the alarm over rising cases and slowing vaccination rates, with a WHO regional director saying the pace of transmission across the region is of \u201cgrave concern.\u201d Much of Europe is battling spikes in infections, with Germany reporting its highest number of daily new cases yesterday since the pandemic began. Meanwhile in the US, vaccinations for children ages 5 to 11 are underway, and federal workers can take paid time off to get their kids inoculated. The Biden administration also announced vaccination and testing mandates will take effect January 4 for private businesses with 100 or more employees, certain health care workers and federal contractors. And two studies released yesterday back up a major benefit of the Covid-19 vaccines, concluding that even if vaccinated people get a breakthrough infection, they don\u2019t get as sick.\u00a0And Pfizer said today its experimental pill designed to fight Covid-19 reduced the risk of hospitalization and death for high-risk patients by about 89%. A state of emergency has been declared in Kazakhstan after days of violent political unrest prompted by anger over increasing fuel prices, poor living standards and corruption. Protesters have set fire to city buildings and stormed the airport in the country\u2019s biggest city, Almaty. The Prime Minister and the government resigned during the chaos, causing even more tension. The public is now dealing with a nationwide internet blackout, and a Russian-led military alliance has reportedly deployed \u201cpeacekeeping\u201d personnel to help stabilize the situation. Virginia Gov.-elect Glenn Youngkin\u2019s election victory this week wasn\u2019t the only big GOP gain in the state. Republicans will win at least 50 seats in the House of Delegates, guaranteeing that Democrats will no longer hold full control there. Dems could still tie the number of seats, resulting in a power-sharing agreement. Virginia Republicans also secured the state\u2019s lieutenant governor and attorney general posts. Democrats still control Virginia\u2019s state Senate, where members don\u2019t face election until 2023, but they could face difficulty in blocking any GOP-led overhauls. The formerly Democratic-controlled state\u2019s election fallout this week is seen as a bellwether of sorts for the 2022 midterms. Babies, pregnant women and nursing mothers are among the 97 hostages that have been freed in a series of rescue operations in northern Nigeria. Local police and the military collaborated on the raids, which targeted two well-known kingpins known for kidnapping in the area. Authorities say the hostages were held captive for more than two months. The International Criminal Court will formally investigate allegations of crimes against humanity in Venezuela. Embattled President Nicolas Maduro\u2019s government has been on the ICC\u2019s radar since 2018. That\u2019s when several South American nations and Canada asked the court to investigate the country for alleged crimes, including extrajudicial murder and torture, dating to 2014. Venezuelans have endured years of political and social unrest, and the United Nations recently accused Venezuelan security forces of using excessive force and arbitrarily detaining thousands of people during protests against Maduro\u2019s government. Maduro has agreed in writing to cooperate with the probe. Opposition leader Juan Guaid\u00f3, who has been backed by dozens of countries as Venezuela\u2019s legitimate president, welcomed the decision. Canada has announced a total of $31.5 billion in compensation for First Nations children who were taken from their families and put into the country\u2019s child welfare system. Half of the money will go toward the potentially hundreds of thousands of children affected, and the other half will be used to reform the system that failed them. Indigenous and human rights organizations have long said such systems discriminate against First Nations children. Billionaire heiress gets married in a gown covered in mirror shards 106 points?!

US voters will head to the polls today to decide a series of races and policies that will test the national political landscape a year into President Joe Biden\u2019s administration, and a year before the all-important midterm elections. Perhaps the most critical race today is in Virginia, where Democrat Terry McAuliffe and Republican Glenn Youngkin are vying to be the state\u2019s next governor. Biden handily won the state in the 2020 election, and Democrats are hoping to keep the state blue. Youngkin, meanwhile, has tried to walk a fine line on handling support from former President Donald Trump, and if he wins, it would provide Republicans with a road map on how to leverage Trump\u2019s influence. Other key decisions to be made today: Police reform is on the ballot in Minnesota, New Jersey\u2019s Democratic governor is looking for a historic reelection, and Atlanta and New York City are choosing new mayors. World leaders exchanged promises and deadlines at the first full day of COP26 talks in Glasgow. Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi finally announced a net-zero emissions target, pledging India will become carbon neutral by 2070. The country has been under pressure to join other major UN nations with such a pledge, but Modi\u2019s deadline is a full two decades after the 2050 deadline experts say is critical to reducing warming due to greenhouse gases. President Joe Biden, meanwhile, apologized for the United States\u2019 withdrawal from the Paris Agreement under the Trump administration. Delegates from smaller nations like Barbados called on world powers to do more to curb rising global temperatures, pointing out that their nations were especially susceptible to things like natural disasters and rising sea levels. Today, more than 100 world leaders representing over 85% of the planet\u2019s forests are expected to commit to ending and reversing deforestation and land degradation by 2030.

            "article_content": "Boston is poised to make history in November with two women of color competing for a mayor\u2019s seat that has been won by White men for the last 200 years. City Councilors Michelle Wu, an Asian American, and Annissa Essaibi George, a first-generation American whose father emigrated from Tunisia and whose mother was born in Germany to Polish parents, claimed the two top spots in Tuesday\u2019s primary, forcing City Councilor Andrea Campbell and Acting Mayor Kim Janey to concede. Campbell and Janey\u2019s losses dashed the hopes of many Boston residents and community leaders who believed it was time for a Black woman to break the glass ceiling as the city struggles with an enormous wealth gap, unequal economic opportunity and segregated neighborhoods. In one of America\u2019s oldest cities, the median net worth for White families is nearly $250,000 compared to just $8 for Black families, according to a 2015 study by the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston. \u201cBut a closer look at the Fed study shows the net worth of Black families in Greater Boston is more nuanced,\u201d according to a WBUR report in July. The study was a small sample size, but local activists say it did reveal that \u201cBlack and Latino families in Greater Boston have far less wealth than White families.\u201d The city is 53% White, 25% Black, 20% Hispanic and 10% Asian, according to census data. However, about two-thirds of the Black residents live in the Dorchester, Roxbury and Mattapan neighborhoods. A growing number of the city\u2019s Hispanic immigrants live in East Boston. Janey and Campbell ran on promises for racial equity, with Janey noting Boston\u2019s history of racism. In the 1970s, opposition to busing turned violent. After a federal judge ordered the city to desegregate its public schools through busing in 1974, White residents responded with fierce criticism. Some pelted school buses carrying Black children with bricks and bottles, and angry protesters mobbed schools. The riots garnered national attention. Some historians say the busing crisis exposed a problem that persists decades later. They say policies were designed to keep Black people out of communities with better housing, schools and job opportunities. Supporters hoped Janey would be the one that would help correct these wrongs. As the candidate with deep roots in the city, supporters were confident that she was headed to a November victory after being appointed Boston\u2019s first Black female mayor following the resignation of Marty Walsh. The number of Black women mayors leading major cities to reach historic high. Here is why they are winning But in the last six months, Janey has come under fire for controversial decisions including firing the police commissioner and comparing the idea of providing proof of Covid-19 vaccination to slavery-era freedom papers, political analyst Jon Keller told CNN affiliate WBZ TV. Keller said Janey, Campbell and John Barros ultimately split the Black vote creating an easier path to victory for Wu and George. \u201cWhat you had was three attractive Black candidates\u2026,\u201d Keller told WBZ TV on Wednesday. \u201cIf there had been one candidate who is getting all of that vote, they would be a runaway winner this morning.\u201d Keller said Campbell\u2019s regular attacks against Janey also hurt the acting mayor\u2019s chances. CNN spoke with Tanisha Sullivan, president of the Boston NAACP and a staunch advocate of diversity in city leadership. She said there were several factors that led to Janey and Campbell\u2019s defeat including low voter turnout and neither candidate had a message that resonated with enough White and Hispanic voters. Many residents, including immigrants, White progressives and White conservatives, are concerned about issues beyond racial equity and Boston\u2019s racist history, she said. Wu and George appealed to those voters. This interview has been lightly edited for clarity. Why do you think Kim Janey and Andrea Campbell were ultimately defeated in Boston\u2019s mayoral primary? It is really about turning out your base, those reliable voters who you can count on on Election Day. One of the contributing factors is both Campbell and Janey are district city councilors who prior to entering this race had very low name recognition. And the two candidates who are proceeding to the finals are at-large city councilors who had already run a citywide campaign. So for both Janey and Campbell, they were starting in a position that was behind, from a base standpoint, the two candidates who are ultimately moving forward. Secondly, Election Day is all about voter turnout. The rubber meets the road when people go to the ballot box to vote. What we saw in the city of Boston was relatively low voter turnout. The third piece is that in a moment where we had an open race and an opportunity  to reflect as a city, this was the time for inspirational, bold, visionary campaigns that really motivated people to get out and vote and that required a lot of voter connection. We did not see that, period. And so that allowed for the other two candidates to really ride on name recognition. What do you think this says about the ongoing fight for Black representation in Boston\u2019s mayoral office? I think it\u2019s important for us to understand that we are not the Boston of the 60s, 70s and 80s.The issues in Boston as it relates to economic mobility and equity do have a significant impact on Black and brown communities, but what candidates must understand is that the campaign cannot be about Black and White issues. The campaign has to acknowledge that the demographics of Boston have changed. We have people who are not familiar with the lived experience or the history of Boston so they are not moved by emotion or the historical context. A campaign must be one that is able to speak to the issues, present clear, coherent, aspirational policy solutions and be able to communicate it in a such a way that all of Boston feels they are part of the vision. And I think that was a challenge. Neither Wu or George has a record on issues of racial equality, neither of them has a record that speaks to addressing economic inequality. They stayed on the issues that are critically important to the city Boston but really were somewhat agnostic at it relates to racial and class lines. In order for us to reach the point where we can celebrate the election of a Black mayor, we have to understand that the development of a campaign has to take into consideration that the city has changed and what resonates with voters has changed and it\u2019s not enough to say we need a Black mayor, there has to be a message that resonates citywide. Do you think Boston\u2019s electorate, given the city\u2019s history of inequity and racism, still struggles with the idea of electing a Black mayor? Absolutely. Race played a role in this campaign. Much of the conversation is about the splitting of the Black vote. I think that\u2019s the wrong conversation. That\u2019s not the end of the story. In order to be elected mayor of the city of Boston, you need more than just the Black vote. Across the ideological spectrum, there were White voters who did not choose to go with a Black candidate. We know Michelle Wu had significant support from White progressives and spoke to the issues that are of concern to that community. Annissa Essaibi George had support from moderate and conservative voters and spoke to the issues that mattered most to them. Where we found ourselves as a Black community was in situation where yes, the Black vote was split but there were not enough White voters or LatinX voters who believed that Campbell or Janey were the right candidates. I do believe it speaks to the work that we still need to do in this city as it relates to racial equity. Do you find some level of confidence knowing that the two candidates advancing to the general election are still women of color and do you think they will tackle racial equity? I\u2019m searching to find data to support that for either of them that racial equity is a priority. I haven\u2019t seen any intention that relates to that issue from either of them. Because both Janey and Campbell spoke so explicitly about racial equity in their campaigns and together they garnered 42% of the vote it will be critically important for Wu and George to figure out how to speak to those voters because they will make a difference in the general election in November.",

            "article_content": "Cutting taxes for the rich helps the poor. There is no such thing as a Republican or a Democratic judge. Climate change is a hoax. Some political myths refuse to die despite all evidence the contrary. Here\u2019s another: When White people are no longer a majority, racism will fade and the US \u201cwill never be a White country again.\u201d This myth was reinforced recently when the US Census\u2019 2020 report revealed that people who identify as White alone declined for the first time since the Census began in 1790. The majority of Americans under 18 are now people of color, and people who identity as multiracial increased by 276% over the last decade. New census figures show America is more diverse and multiracial than ever These Census figures seemed to validate a common assumption: The US is barreling toward becoming a rainbow nation around 2045, when White people are projected to become a minority. That year has been depicted as \u201ca countdown to the White apocalypse,\u201d and \u201cdreadful\u201d news for White supremacists.\u201d Two commentators even predicted the US \u201cWhite majority will soon disappear forever.\u201d It\u2019s now taken as a given that the \u201cBrowning of America\u201d will lead to the erosion of White supremacy. I used to believe those predictions. Now I have a different conclusion: Don\u2019t ever underestimate White supremacy\u2019s ability to adapt. The assumption that more racial diversity equals more racial equality is a dangerous myth. Racial diversity can function as a cloaking device, concealing the most powerful forms of White supremacy while giving the appearance of racial progress. Racism will likely be just as entrenched in a browner America as it is now. It will still be White supremacy, with a tan. I don\u2019t like raising such a pessimistic scenario, in part for personal reasons. I want to believe my country is on the verge of this Brown New World where there will be such a rich gumbo of skin hues, hair textures and racially ambiguous people that racism will lose its sting. My family is a symbol of these demographic changes. My mother is Irish; my father was Black. My wife is an immigrant from Central America with a biracial mother and a White \u201cLadino\u201d father who was Jewish and Castilian. My stepmother is Chilean, and half of my siblings are Afro-Latino.   I have one relative with blonde hair and blue eyes who moves through the world as a young White man, but he\u2019s really Afro-Latino. And I have another Black relative who went to court to argue that he was White (he lost). The 2020 Census could have used my family portrait for a poster. There is a yearning embedded in my DNA that a demographic tide will overtake White supremacy \u2013 the belief that White people are superior and they should maintain political, social and economic power over other races. This yearning is not driven by some wish that people of color will someday rule over Whites. It\u2019s a hope for a more just America, a hope that we can somehow escape the tribalism that tore other countries apart. That hope was captured by one of the savviest commentators on race in America, in a passage I can\u2019t seem to forget. After President Obama was re-elected in 2012, David Simon, creator of the HBO series \u201cThe Wire,\u201d wrote: \u201cAmerica will soon belong to the men and women \u2013 white and black and Latino and Asian, Christian and Jew and Muslim and atheist, gay and straight \u2013 who can walk into a room and accept with real comfort the sensation that they are in a world of certain difference, that there are no real majorities, only pluralities and coalitions.\u201d Simon added that \u201cthis may be the last [presidential] election in which anyone but a fool tries to play \u2013 on a national level, at least \u2013 the cards of racial exclusion, of immigrant fear\u2026\u201d We know what happened next:  Donald Trump was elected president. White supremacists marched in Charlottesville. Rioters waved Confederate flags during the Jan. 6 insurrection at the US Capitol. The list goes on. It turns out that the reports of White supremacy\u2019s demise were exaggerated. White supremacy isn\u2019t just more resilient than many assume. It\u2019s also elastic. Consider how Whiteness has been defined. It\u2019s a prime example of how White supremacy adapts. The census suggests that White Americans will be a minority by 2045, but as several commentators have already noted, that date can easily be postponed. Whiteness isn\u2019t a fixed identity; it\u2019s like taffy \u2013 it expands to accommodate new members, if they have the right look. In books like \u201cHow The Irish Became White\u201d and \u201cWorking Toward Whiteness,\u201d scholars have argued that the definition of Whiteness has expanded to include Irish, Italian and Jewish people \u2013 groups that once weren\u2019t considered fully White in the US. The US has broadened its definition of White people throughout history enough to maintain power over Black, Asian and Latino people, writes political scientist Justin Gest in a recent essay, \u201cWhat the \u2018Majority Minority\u2019 Shift Really Means for America.\u201d \u201cThrough a historical lens, being white in America today is like belonging to a once-exclusive social club that had to loosen its membership criteria to stay afloat,\u201d Gest writes. Why do so many racial groups gravitate toward Whiteness? The answer is both pragmatic and psychological. It\u2019s due to a racial hierarchy that places Whiter-looking people at the top and darker-skinned people at the bottom of the socio-economic ladder. \u201cSometimes looking White puts money directly into your pockets,\u201d says Tanya K. Hernandez, author of the forthcoming book \u201cRacial Innocence: Unmasking Latino Anti-Black Bias and The Struggle for Equality.\u201d \u201cYou get access to jobs, opportunities and being viewed as competent.  But there\u2019s also a psychological benefit, that feeling of having enhanced status, of being part of Whiteness.\u201d This racial hierarchy is the foundation of White supremacy. Europeans created it around 500 years ago to justify slavery and colonialism. This hierarchy is where we get the modern conception of race \u2013 how a person\u2019s inherent worth, intelligence or attractiveness can be determined by the pigmentation of their skin. For those who fret about the \u201cdisappearing White majority,\u201d I say look at history: The numbers and types of people who are defined as White may change, but the status and power that comes with being White has remained the same. It\u2019s a hard truth for me to accept, because I see that racial hierarchy at work within my family. I have young male relatives who appear to the world as Black, and one who appears as White. They might as well live in different universes. One is an artistic teenager with curly blonde hair, blue eyes and pale skin who is already more physically imposing than most men. I call him an \u201cUndercover Brother.\u201d When a classmate tried unsuccessfully to get him suspended by accusing him of bullying her, I surprised myself by telling my wife: \u201cThank God he looks White.\u201d If the same accusation had been made against a darker relative of mine, the outcome may have been different. My relative is a proud Afro-Latino. His mother teaches him about his heritage. But I wonder when he becomes an adult \u2013 and competes for jobs and deals with the police \u2013 whether will he come to the same conclusion I did: \u201cThank God I look White.\u201d Someday he may even mark \u201cWhite\u201d on his census forms. Other Latino Americans have already made that same choice. This is another way that Whiteness preserves its dominance. In the 2010 Census, for example, researchers discovered that some 1.2 million Americans who had identified as \u201cHispanic, Latino or Spanish origin\u201d a decade earlier had changed their race from \u201csome other race\u201d to \u201cwhite.\u201d \u201cThe data also call into question whether America is destined to become a so-called minority-majority nation, where whites represent a minority of the nation\u2019s population,\u201d said the The New York Times. \u201cThose projections assume that Hispanics aren\u2019t white, but if Hispanics ultimately identify as white Americans, then whites will remain the majority for the foreseeable future.\u201d That number, however, plunged in the 2020 census. It revealed a drastic drop in the number of Latinos or Hispanics who identify as White. That drop may be due to Black Lives Matter protests and former President Trump\u2019s well-documented hostility to non-White immigrants and his administration\u2019s unsuccessful attempt to reduce the count of Latinos by manipulating the 2020 Census. The future of Whiteness in America may rest with Latino people. It could go either way. A study suggests that Latino identity fades across successive generations as immigrant connections fade away. If large numbers of Latino people identify as White in the future, Whiteness will expand. The enhanced status and socio-economic benefits that come from identifying as White will be too tempting for many to ignore. The link between Whiteness and status is already a reality in some Latin American countries. In places like Brazil and Cuba, mixed-race people and interracial marriages are common. Latin Americans tend to think of themselves not in terms of race, but nationality. Yet discrimination against darker-skinned and indigenous people is common there and many other Latin American countries. There\u2019s still a widespread belief that the Whiter a person looks, the better it is for them. These countries offer proof that a country can have a large and expanding population of Black, brown and multiracial people \u2013 and still be governed by the same racial hierarchy that gave us slavery and colonialism. Consider Brazil. It is home to more people of African heritage than any country outside Africa, and roughly 40% of Brazilians identify as mixed race. But many Brazilians\u2019 economic and educational prospects are still shaped by colorism \u2013 the notion that a person\u2019s inherent worth is determined by their skin color, according to an article in Foreign Policy that looked at the country\u2019s racial landscape. Some 80% of the country\u2019s one-percenters are white, the article said. \u201cToday, Brazilians see themselves as falling across a spectrum of skin colors with a dizzying assortment of names: burnt white, brown, dark nut, light nut, black, and copper,\u201d Cleuci De Oliveira wrote in the article. \u201cWhat ultimately binds these definitions together is an awareness that the less \u2018black\u2019 a person looks, the better.\u201d In a recent twist, the percentage of Brazilians who identify as Black or mixed race has risen slightly because of affirmative action policies and because they identify with the racial protests in the US that followed the murder of George Floyd. Cuba also has a complex history with race. Racism is often described as a relic of capitalism in the communist country. Hernandez, the author, says the country\u2019s late ruler, Fidel Castro, outlawed racial discrimination and political parties built along racial lines. But while racism is banned by law in Cuba, it is \u201calive on the streets.\u201d The country\u2019s Afro-Cuban population is still locked out of most elite circles, which are dominated by Anglo-looking Cubans. \u201cWhat you have is a very highly educated Afro-Cuban population and yet there\u2019s a glass ceiling,\u201d says Hernandez, who is also a professor at the Fordham University School of Law in New York City. \u201cThere\u2019s still a penalty for Blackness where it can only reach so high.\u201d What\u2019s happened in some Latin American countries can easily happen in the United States. There will be cosmetic changes in our racial makeup \u2013 more Black, brown and multiracial people. But the dominant group will remain White people, however they may be defined by 2045. We will have arrived at one what one sociologist calls the \u201cLatin-Americanization of race\u201d in the US. There will be more, not less, racial inequality in the US because people will cite the nation\u2019s growing diversity to \u201cdrown out\u201d those voices of darker-skinned people still fighting for racial justice, says Eduardo Bonilla-Silva, author of \u201cRacism without Racists: Color-Blind Racism and the Persistence of Racial Inequality in America.\u201d \u201cThe apparent blessing of \u2018not seeing race\u2019 will become a curse for those struggling for racial justice in years to come, Bonilla-Silva wrote. You can no longer fight racism if everyone believes their country has moved past race. Some people pin their hopes for a more racially tolerant future on multiracial people. That issue hits even closer to home for me. I\u2019m old enough to remember when biracial children were treated as objects of pity \u2013 confused \u201cmixed nuts,\u201d accepted by neither Black nor White people. That belief is where we get the \u201ctragic mulatto\u201d myth reflected in Hollywood movies like \u201cImitation of Life.\u201d The tragic mulatto, however, has been transformed into what I call the \u201cmagic mulatto.\u201d Being biracial is now cool. People like Barack Obama, Vice President Kamala Harris, golfer Tiger Woods and director Jordan Peele are now seen as inspirational figures. We\u2019re often described as the vanguard of a new racial order in which interracial couples and their children will chip away at White supremacy until it collapses. Sheryll Cashin, author of \u201cLoving: Interracial Intimacy in America and the Threat to White Supremacy,\u201d once said that people who pursue interracial relationships \u201care our greatest hope for racial understanding\u201d because they encourage white Americans to empathize with other races. \u201cEventually, a critical mass of white people will accept the loss of the centrality of whiteness,\u201d Cashin wrote in a New York Times essay.  \u201cWhen enough whites can accept being one voice among many in a robust democracy, politics in America could finally become functional.\u201d But the explosive growth of Americans who now identify as multiracial could also be used to reinforce racial inequality. How? It depends on how we check the box. During his first term in office, President Obama made headlines when he marked his race as \u201cAfrican-American\u201d on the 2010 Census. He could have checked \u201csome other race\u201d because his mother was White, but there are political ramifications for marking \u201cBlack\u201d on Census and other forms. Racial classification numbers are a great tool for uncovering the hidden hand of White supremacy: systemic racism. These numbers are used to enforce civil rights laws, track discrimination and protect voting rights. The US Justice Department, for example, relied on racial classification statistics in its 2015 report to detail how the city government in Ferguson, Missouri, systematically violated the constitutional rights of its Black residents. Police subjected Black citizens in Ferguson to a disproportionate share of unwarranted traffic stops, arrests and \u201cuse of force\u201d incidents, the report found. This pattern of racial discrimination would not have been uncovered, though, if federal officials didn\u2019t have records for the number of Blacks in Ferguson. \u201cThe Census is not an invitation to express yourself,\u201d Hernandez says. \u201cThat race data is central to enforcing our civil rights laws.\u201d There has long been a debate in the multiracial community, though, about how we express ourselves. Some say we shouldn\u2019t confine our choice to the Black box but should instead select \u201csome other race\u201d \u2013 or even White. That debate erupted at the dinner table with my father one day. When I told him that I define myself as Black, he dropped his fork in anger and raised his voice. \u201cWhen you say you\u2019re Black, you deny your mother,\u201d he said. I didn\u2019t know how to explain to my father that if more multiracial people with a Black parent checked the \u201csome other race\u201d box, it could make it easier for institutions to conceal racism. It\u2019s a tricky subject, because some multiracial people feel torn between their loyalty to a parent and to a race. How we check the box, though, can shield White supremacy instead of dismantling its power. Here\u2019s the hard truth we must face about the future: We may live someday in an America where there are no racial majorities, but Whiteness can still reign supreme. Nothing will change, though, unless we go after the racial hierarchy that makes Whiteness such an exclusive club. That requires radical change. It would involve uprooting systemic racism embedded in our public schools, neighborhoods and justice system. It would involve a more equitable sharing of power and resources \u2013 not out of White guilt or compulsion but out of the knowledge that \u201cWe all do better when we all do better.\u201d It will ultimately require that we discard the modern notion of race, the biological fiction that there is something called a \u201cBlack person\u201d or a \u201cWhite person\u201d or an \u201cAsian person.\u201d The modern concept of race has been used too long to enslave and exploit. As Audre Lorde, the poet and activist, once said, \u201cThe master\u2019s tools will never dismantle the master\u2019s house.\u201d We can\u2019t get there, though, if we continue to underestimate the resilience of White supremacy. It is a shapeshifter that can adapt to any environment. It survived a revolution whose leaders declared \u201call men are created equal,\u201d a Civil War, the civil rights movement, several \u201cracial reckonings,\u201d and the nation\u2019s first Black president. It keeps on keeping on. The US may indeed become a majority minority country around 2045. We may become a rainbow nation of varying racial identities, skin tones and interracial unions. But if we don\u2019t dismantle the racial hierarchy that gives status and power to Whiteness, this new version of America won\u2019t really be new. It\u2019ll be just another updated version of White supremacy \u2013 with a tan.",

            "article_content": "When Medgar Evers and Jimmie Lee Jackson were killed amid a yearslong battle for voting rights, it brought a sense of doom and darkness over the civil rights movement of the 1960s. Evers, a NAACP field secretary and civil rights leader who organized voter registration drives, boycotts and protests against school segregation, was shot in the back by a White supremacist in his driveway in June 1963. Fight for voting rights intensifies as the nation marks one year since civil rights icon John Lewis' death Jackson, a church deacon, was shot in the stomach by an Alabama State Trooper while trying to protect his mother during a march for voting rights in Marion, Alabama, in February 1965. Despite the anger and grief in the wake of their deaths, the civil rights movement pressed forward, activists and protesters kept marching and in August 1965, President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act, which prohibited racial discrimination in voting. The leaders of today\u2019s movement say they are carrying that same spirit of resilience as they lobby for Congress to pass federal voting legislation that would counter state-level laws they say are suppressing Black and brown voters. On Saturday, the March on for Voting Rights will take place in Washington DC, Atlanta, Houston, Phoenix and Miami to put pressure on the Senate to pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, which increases the power of the federal government to block discriminatory election rules. The bill was passed in the House earlier this week but faces an uphill battle with the Senate given most Republicans oppose it. But in a loss for Democrats on Friday, the Texas House approved a Republican voting restrictions bill after months of delays. Opponents warned that the bill would make voting harder for people of color, who often back Democrats, as well as disabled people \u2013 in part by outlawing the all-night and drive-through voting that Houston conducted during the 2020 election. Saturday\u2019s mass mobilization will mark the 58th anniversary of the historic March on Washington where Martin Luther King Jr. delivered his \u201cI Have a Dream\u201d speech. That march came just two months after Evers\u2019 death. An anniversary march was also held last year in Washington on the heels of nationwide protests following the death of George Floyd. The March On for Voting Rights comes after the arrests this summer of several civil rights leaders and lawmakers protesting voter suppression. Among them were Rev. Jesse Jackson, Rev. William J. Barber II, Cliff Albright, Rep. Hank Johnson and Rep. Joyce Beatty. The Rev. Al Sharpton, who is helping lead Saturday\u2019s march, said the deaths of Jimmie Lee Jackson and Evers taught many that the road to equality is never easy. A few weeks after Jackson was killed in 1965, John Lewis was beaten by White police officers so badly that he suffered a broken skull during \u201cBloody Sunday.\u201d Lewis and others marched for voting rights across the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Alabama. \u201cIt\u2019s always been darkness before light broke through,\u201d Sharpton said. \u201cWe come out of that tradition.\u201d Civil rights icon Andrew Young said Jimmie Lee Jackson\u2019s death was actually the breaking point that led to the Selma march. Jackson, who had just returned from Vietnam, was attending his first march in Marion, Alabama with his mother and grandfather when he was shot trying to shield his mother from being beaten. Young recalled marching six miles in the freezing rain with other leaders from Jackson\u2019s funeral at a local church to the cemetery. Frustrated with Jackson\u2019s death, they began planning their next move: they were going to march from Selma to Montgomery to demand voting rights. What you need to know about this weekend's March On for Voting Rights Violence from police and White supremacists would never stop their fight, Young said. \u201cIf somebody gets killed doing something right you have to send people there to take their place,\u201d Young said. \u201cBecause if you don\u2019t, you send the message that all you have to do to stop us is to kill someone.\u201d Mary Marcus, a friend of Jimmie Lee Jackson\u2019s family, said Jackson wasn\u2019t a vocal civil rights leader. He was a quiet man who mostly supported the movement behind the scenes, including taking his mother and grandfather to the march the day he was shot. Young said Jackson occasionally volunteered with voter registration efforts. Marcus said she hopes today\u2019s activists understand the battle for equality often requires sacrifice from more than just civil rights leaders, but also the foot soldiers in the background. \u201cHis (Jackson\u2019s) role was supporting those who supported the movement,\u201d said Marcus, 62 of Marion. \u201cAs a result of that when it was his turn to go to the rescue of someone else, he did. As a result of that he lost his life.\u201d Months after Jimmie Lee Jackson was slain and the Selma march happened, Congress passed the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and Johnson signed it. Young recalled going to the White House with Martin Luther King Jr. to meet with Johnson who insisted he did not have enough votes from Congress to get the bill passed. NAACP launches national campaign in latest strategy to combat widespread voter suppression efforts But Selma, Young said, influenced public opinion of voting rights and prompted lawmakers to support the bill. He believes today\u2019s activist\u2019s can learn from the power of their organizing. \u201cWe riled up the nation,\u201d Young said. \u201cThat persuaded the citizens that voting rights needed to be protected and that gave the president the power.\u201d Rev. Jesse Jackson, who was hospitalized last week for Covid-19, said in a statement that he will not be attending the march Saturday and is still receiving medical care. Jackson urged the nation to march whether in DC or at a local demonstration and pressure Congress to pass federal voting bills. He said the right to vote is key to jobs, raising minimum wage, criminal justice reform, expanded health care and improving public education. \u201cSo we want everybody to put on your marching shoes, and keep them on until everyone\u2019s right to vote is protected,\u201d Jackson said. \u201cKeep marching and keep hope alive.\u201d Martin Luther King III, King Jr.\u2019s eldest son who is also leading Saturday\u2019s march, said he has seen fervor in the demonstrators who rallied across the country after Floyd\u2019s death and showed up at last year\u2019s anniversary march. And while the 1963 March on Washington ultimately led to key voting rights legislation \u2013 one of its top demands in addition to jobs and civil rights \u2013 voter suppression efforts in recent years have been a setback, King said. Many of the tactics being used to disenfranchise Black and brown voters are \u201ca more sophisticated form of Jim Crow,\u201d King said. King said he hopes the Saturday march sends the message that there is an urgency to rally around voting rights. He called it \u201cfrightening\u201d that state legislatures are enacting laws that give them control over election outcomes. \u201cWe are not going to just sit by idle and allow our rights to be eroded,\u201d King said. \u201cMy hope is that the community understands this is enough. We\u2019re not going to give up. \u201c",

            "article_content": "People across the United States are marching on Saturday to demand that Congress pass sweeping voting rights legislation and that state lawmakers halt efforts to enact bills that restrict voting access. The \u201cMarch On for Voting Rights\u201d will host its flagship event in Washington DC, but marches will also take place in other major cities, including Atlanta, Miami, Phoenix and Houston. Voting rights march leaders honor the sacrifice made by foot soldiers killed during the civil rights era Marchers in Washington will gather at the Lincoln Memorial to commemorate the 58th anniversary of the historic 1963 civil rights march on Washington, where Martin Luther King Jr. delivered his famous \u201cI Have a Dream\u201d speech. Millions of people are expected to attend marches throughout the country, according to a press release from March On for Voting Rights organizers. This will be the second consecutive year that organizers have commemorated the March on Washington with a renewed effort to fight for equality. The \u201cGet Your Knee Off Our Necks Commitment March\u201d in 2020 in Washington pushed for federal voting rights legislation and police reform, and came at the height of a racial reckoning sparked by George Floyd\u2019s death. Plans for the march were announced in June, one day after Senate Republicans blocked the For the People Act \u2013 a signature voting and election bill that Democrats had pitched to counter state-level efforts to restrict voting access. Republicans denounced the bill as a partisan power grab and a federal overreach into state voting and election systems. Here\u2019s what you need to know. The main march will be held in Washington, but there are other marches planned in more than 40 cities and towns across the US on Saturday. The March On for Voting Rights official website has a map where you can check if there is a march near you. There are also multiple virtual events taking place on the same day. If there isn\u2019t a March On for Voting Rights event near you, organizers will let you host one and will include it on the organization\u2019s map. The schedule for main event in Washington DC is as follows: Check the official website to find out when the march is taking place in your city. People will gather at 8 a.m. at McPherson Square Park at 15th St., NW, and H Street, to march from McPherson Square past Black Lives Matter Plaza, passing the White House and Washington Monument. The closing rally will take place with the backdrop of the National Mall, entering at 12th St. and Madison Drive, gathering from 7th St. to 14th St. between Jefferson Dr. and Madison Drive. Martin Luther King III, the eldest son of Martin Luther King Jr., and his wife, Arndrea Waters King, along with Rev. Al Sharpton, Andi Pringle and other voting rights leaders organized the march in an effort to urge lawmakers to pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act. The bill, which increases the power of the federal government and racial minorities to block or challenge election rules they find discriminatory, was passed by the House on Tuesday. The bill faces a steep climb in the Senate, where the vast majority of Republicans oppose it, calling the legislation a massive federal overreach into the states\u2019 role in elections. At this point, Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski is the only Senate Republican expected to support the bill. \u201cIf you want to understand why the vote is so important, look at the last 4 years, the last 10 years, and the last 100 years,\u201d Rev. Al Sharpton, who heads the National Action Network, said in a statement  \u201cFreedom fighter and Congressman John Lewis knew it was essential that every vote must count in order to assure every voice is represented, but unfortunately through federal voter suppression and gerrymandering, that hasn\u2019t been the case.\u201d \u201cWhether in Congress, in the streets, or during our March On for Voting Rights, this is the summer of activism,\u201d he added. The march is sponsored by Drum Major Institute, March On, the National Action Network, Future Coalition, SEIU, and 51 for 51, and is funded by the #ForJohn campaign. The campaign was launched by Martin Luther King III, and his wife, Arndrea King, to raise money for local organizers in critical states who are fighting for equal voting rights and pressing their Senators to pass election reform legislation. Elected officials, civil rights leaders, youth organizers, community activists and others will join Rev. Sharpton, Martin Luther King III and Arndrea Waters King on the stage. Many speakers, including Martin Luther King Jr.\u2019s granddaughter and activist Yolanda Renee King; Philonise Floyd, activist and brother of George Floyd; NAACP President Derrick Johnson; and Washington DC Mayor Muriel Bowser will address the marchers. \u201cCoretta Scott King told us, \u2018Freedom is never really won, you earn it and win it in every generation,\u2019\u201d Arndrea Waters King, Drum Major Institute president, said in a statement. \u201cNow is the time to earn and win our sacred right to vote. It is up to us to remind Congress they represent the people, and the people demand the passage of the John Lewis Voting Rights Restoration Act.\u201d CNN\u2019s Alex Rogers and Nicquel Terry Ellis contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Decades after Lupe Alem\u00e1n was forced to repeat the first grade three times, her son is making it his life\u2019s work to reverse racial inequity in schools. Enrique Alem\u00e1n Jr., 50, has spent the past few years talking with numerous students in Texas and across the United States about how his mother and other Mexican American children in Driscoll, Texas, were treated in the 1950s by school officials who claimed they couldn\u2019t speak or understand English. But a controversial law that goes into effect on September 1 will restrict how social studies teachers in the Lone Star State discuss race. The law could also make it potentially difficult to discuss why Lupe Alem\u00e1n and at least seven other children went to federal court in the year after the landmark US Supreme Court ruling Brown v. Board of Education in 1954. \u201cI think it\u2019s very bad for students of all races to not talk about the uncomfortable aspects of our history. And it\u2019s especially bad for Latino youth to not understand that Texas has been a violent, racist, discriminatory place to live,\u201d Alem\u00e1n Jr. told CNN. While Texas lawmakers have been embroiled in a battle over election laws in recent months, \u201ccritical race theory\u201d legislation has been another priority for Republicans in the state. In June, Republican Gov. Greg Abbott signed into law HB3979, and an expanded version of that bill is currently being considered by the state Senate in a second special legislative session that began on August 7. Critical race theory has become a social and political lightning rod. This is how we got here HB3979 states that social studies teachers can\u2019t \u201crequire\u201d or include in their courses, the concept that \u201cone race or sex is inherently superior to another race or sex\u201d or the concept that \u201can individual, by virtue of the individual\u2019s race or sex, is inherently racist, sexist or oppressive, whether consciously or unconsciously.\u201d It also notes that \u201ca teacher may not be compelled to discuss a particular current event or widely debated and currently controversial issue of public policy or social affairs.\u201d Teachers, according to the bill, also can\u2019t require or give extra credit for a student\u2019s political activism. The legislation proposed by Senate Republicans, SB3, intends to extend the restrictions to all teachers, regardless of subject or grade level. In 1955, a group of children and their parents sued the Driscoll Consolidated Independent School District for placing Mexican American children in the first grade for a period of three years solely because they were of Mexican descent, according to the federal lawsuit. The school district in Driscoll, a town of nearly 800 people about two hours south of San Antonio, said in court that students were only placed in separate classrooms because of their lack of English proficiency.  School officials said it deprived other students from teachers\u2019 attention and instruction, and not because of their country of origin, court documents show. After several students appeared in court to testify that they were fluent in English, US District Judge James V. Allred ruled in 1957 that it was unreasonable to place students in separate classrooms based their race or origin. CNN reached out to the current superintendent and board members of the Driscoll Independent School District for comment multiple times. Alem\u00e1n Jr. was about 10 years old when he picked up his mother\u2019s high school yearbook and his mother shared two details of her life that, at the time, he didn\u2019t comprehend. As a young girl in Driscoll, Lupe Alem\u00e1n was part of a court case, and by the time she graduated high school, she was nearly 21 years old, Alem\u00e1n Jr. says his mother told him. It was more than two decades later that Alem\u00e1n Jr. realized what his mother was referring to. Alem\u00e1n Jr. was 33 years old when he saw a documentary on TV about Hector P. Garcia, a Texas civil rights advocate who founded the American G.I. Forum, a group that helped Mexican American veterans fight discrimination. The documentary recounts Garcia\u2019s life and activism, including how the group filed a federal lawsuit in the mid-1950s against the school district in Driscoll. \u201cI immediately had a flashback and remembered what my mother told me,\u201d he said. His mother, who was born in Driscoll, lived there until she was a young adult and would have been about 9 years old when the lawsuit was filed, Alem\u00e1n Jr. said. But he couldn\u2019t just pick up the phone and ask his mother about the case. His mom had died a few months before he watched the documentary, he said. \u201cI was amazed and I was upset,\u201d Alem\u00e1n Jr. said, adding that his mother and two of his aunts testified in court. \u201cI didn\u2019t understand why nobody ever talked about it.\u201d As Alem\u00e1n Jr. continued his education and he focused his research on the inequities that Black and brown students face in school, he couldn\u2019t forget about his family\u2019s history. In 2012, he traveled across Texas to meet several of the children who testified along with his mother for the Hernandez v Driscoll CISD case and produced a documentary called \u201cStolen Education.\u201d He learned that some were punished for speaking Spanish in school or had seen classmates being paddled by teachers. Some graduated high school and others dropped out of school to work or join the military, he said. They went on with their lives, Alem\u00e1n Jr. says, but \u201cthere\u2019s still something in them that feels like they didn\u2019t reach their full potential because of the way that they started out.\u201d Educators and advocates say they are concerned the new law will have negative implications for the decades-long effort to make the history being taught in Texas schools more inclusive. More than 52% of the 5.3 million children enrolled in kindergarten to 12th grade across Texas in the last school year were Hispanic or Latino, Texas Education Agency (TEA) data shows. Yet, curriculum standards to teach Mexican American studies, only as an elective high school course, were only approved in 2018 after years of debate. Sonia Hernandez, an associate professor of history at Texas A&M University, who works with the nonprofit Refusing to Forget to shine light on the killings of Mexican Americans by Texas Rangers in the 1910s and 1920s, said she was saddened to see that an \u201cunfounded idea\u201d could become a set back for advocates and educators in the state. \u201cJust so many years of great effort are being pushed aside because of the unfounded idea that if we talk about issues of racial inequality, if we talk about how certain groups of people were marginalized and were treated as second- class citizens \u2013 even if they were in fact US citizens \u2013 that would lead to some kind of unpatriotic history,\u201d Hernandez said. \u201cWe are doing our students a disservice, we are telling them that we think they\u2019re not intellectually equipped to understand a complex history of their own country,\u201d she added. Texas Senate advances bill to restrict how race, nation's history is taught in schools For Tony Diaz, an author and activist, the new law and efforts around the \u201ccritical race theory\u201d legislation echoes the sentiment behind the Arizona law that banned Mexican American studies in public schools about a decade ago. \u201cThose same tendencies are back in a new form,\u201d said Diaz, who campaigned against the ban in Arizona schools by launching Librotraficante, a caravan to take books banned under the same law to Arizona. The Texas law intends to intimidate teachers, Diaz says, and it will take similar \u201cvery profound grassroots campaign\u201d to overturn it. Weeks before the new law goes into effect, it\u2019s still unclear how schools will implement it. The TEA has not yet issued guidance for schools and the agency hasn\u2019t yet responded to CNN\u2019s request for comment. Angela Valenzuela, an education policy professor at the University of Texas, said the law doesn\u2019t address how schools will implement or enforce it. \u201cI think ultimately it is intended to create division at the grassroots level to empower parents that feel their children are being hurt by either teaching concepts like white supremacy, white privilege, the history of racism and slavery,\u201d Valenzuela said. For Alem\u00e1n Jr., who is now a Lillian Radford endowed professor of education at Trinity University and teaches classes for education leaders, the educational system in the state has in part \u201cnever wanted Latinos, African Americans and women to even know their own part\u201d in history. Learning what happened to his mother and other Mexican American children in Driscoll changed the purpose of Alem\u00e1n\u2019s work. It also made him feel close to his mom even decades after she passed away. It\u2019s empowering to know where you come from and that feeling, he says, it\u2019s something he hopes more Latinos and students of color can feel while they are in school.",

            "article_content": "One autumn evening, Nelson Mandela answered a knock at his front door and found himself facing his most dangerous enemy. The man\u2019s name was General Constand Viljoen, and he was dubbed the \u201cultimate enforcer\u201d of apartheid, the brutal system where Whites had ruled over Blacks in South Africa for much of the 20th century. Viljoen was the former chief of the South African Defense Force, which had crushed dissent in Black townships and, some say, assassinated Black activists. He thought Mandela was a terrorist who deserved execution. \u201cAh, hello, General,\u201d Mandela said, greeting Viljoen with a big smile. \u201cHow very good to see you. I have heard so much about you. Thank you very much for accepting my invitation.\u201d It was October 1993, and both men were trying to stop a looming civil war. Many White South Africans were terrified of losing political power in an impending national election. Political factions murdered one another in the streets. And an alliance of White supremacist groups had asked Viljoen to lead an armed insurrection against the government. Viljoen didn\u2019t trust Mandela but accepted his invitation as a last resort to avert war. But then something happened to Viljoen after he talked over tea with Mandela. By the end of the evening, Viljoen had not only accepted Mandela\u2019s request to call off the insurrection; he persuaded other White South Africans to participate in the upcoming election. And when Mandela was inaugurated as South Africa\u2019s President a year later following the nation\u2019s first fully Democratic elections, Viljoen stood in the middle of the new parliament, saluted him, and would later call him \u201cthe greatest of men.\u201d How did Mandela change the mind of a man once described as the \u201cultimate racist?\u201d The answer to that question holds some critical lessons for the treacherous political environment in the US today. As the world commemorates the 103rd birthday of Mandela this Sunday, this is the perfect time to explore how Mandela helped steer South Africa through some of the same racial and political divisions that engulf the US today. \u201cHe took a political divide and racial divisions that go way beyond what you\u2019re living in the US right now, and he managed to build a bridge,\u201d says John Carlin, author of three books on Mandela, and a journalist who befriended Mandela . He took a political divide and racial divisions that go way beyond what you\u2019re living in the US right now, and he managed to build a bridge. John Carlin, journalist and author of \"Knowing Mandela.\" \u201cFor those people in America who would like to explore how to build bridges across chasms that get ever wider in America, he\u2019s worthy of study,\u201d says Carlin, author of \u201cKnowing Mandela,\u201d and \u201cInvictus,\u201d which was made into a Hollywood movie. The standard explanation for Mandela\u2019s success is he forgave his former captors, flashed his luminous smile, and won them over with decency. The truth is more complicated, and so was Mandela. We can learn a lot about how Mandela operated by looking at three crucial decisions he made when facing some of the same issues that divide America today. If you think the mood in the US is ugly today, consider the country Mandela was trying to lead in the early 1990s. A mob of armed White citizens stormed the most important political venue in the country as lawmakers fled for safety in an attempt to derail the upcoming elections. White citizens stockpiled guns. Unscrupulous political leaders egged on street violence to raise their profiles and build followers. It looked in some ways like a sneak preview of the Jan. 6 insurrection at the US Capitol. A country built on White supremacy was trying to become a multiracial democracy, and many observers didn\u2019t think they would make it. At the center of much of the violence was fear of what the Afrikaners \u2013 South Africa\u2019s dominant White ethnic group \u2013 called the \u201cBlack danger,\u201d or \u201cSwart Gevaar.\u201d  Apartheid denied 85% of the population, those born with dark skin, any political power. Blacks couldn\u2019t vote, compete with Whites in the workplace; couldn\u2019t use the same public toilets, buses, beaches, and many lived in squalor. \u201cWhite South Africans were the most privileged people in the world in the 1990s,\u201d Carlin says. \u201cEven if you were a working-class White guy in a factory, you possibly had two [Black] live-in maids and a swimming pool.\u201d Mandela had to sell democracy to a people that had richly benefitted from its absence. That sale became harder on April 10, 1993, when a White supremacist assassinated Chris Hani, a beloved Black South African leader. Hani, widely seen as Mandela\u2019s heir apparent, was a surrogate son to Mandela. But that\u2019s when Mandela made a crucial decision that stopped South Africa from tumbling over what he called \u201cthe brink of disaster.\u201d Mandela went on national radio and television to appeal for calm. He didn\u2019t just focus on the White supremacist that murdered Hani, he highlighted a White hero, a White woman who witnessed the murder, and helped authorities identify the killer by writing down the license plate of the killer\u2019s getaway car. \u201cA White woman, of Afrikaner origin, risked her life so that we may know and bring to justice this assassin,\u201d Mandela said. Afrikaners had caused Mandela a lifetime of anguish. Their regime had sentenced him to life in prison in 1964. They took him away from his family and his wife. They tortured and assassinated his closest friends. And yet, in that moment, he chose the highlight the decency of an Afrikaner woman he had never met. \u201cWhat I know is that if he hadn\u2019t been around, the country would, in fact, have torn itself apart,\u201d Archbishop Desmond Tutu said about Mandela\u2019s conduct after Hani\u2019s assassination during a PBS interview. It\u2019s become customary for people to demonize political opponents in this country. Videos go viral on social media that show commentators \u201cdestroying\u201d their political opponents. Surveys reveal that while Americans are more open to interracial marriage and marriage equality, more now also oppose \u201cinterpolitical\u201d unions, or marriages to someone of another political party. But Mandela turned empathy into a political weapon. He used it not only to diffuse a national crisis but to survive prison. Mandela developed such a close relationship with Christo Brand, his White jailer, that Brand once snuck his infant son into prison just so Mandela could hold his son in his arms. Those who knew Mandela as a younger man say he was a hothead with a temper, but prison changed him. He developed a radial form of empathy that went beyond political expedience. \u201cPrison steeled him, but it broke many others,\u201d Richard Stengel, the author of \u201cMandela\u2019s Way: Fifteen Lessons on Life, Love, and Courage,\u201d wrote. \u201cUnderstanding that made him more empathetic, not less. He never lorded it over those who could not take it. He never blamed anyone for giving in. Over the years, he developed a radar and a deep sympathy for human frailty.\u201d Professional athletes refuse to stand for the national anthem. Protesters clash over the removal of Confederate monuments. People still clash over how racism should be taught in the classroom. Mandela faced many of the same challenges when on April 27, 1994 he became the first democratically elected President of South Africa. He had to decide how South Africa came to terms with the racist symbols of its past. A debate over South Africa\u2019s national anthem revealed how Mandela adroitly faced this challenge. Leaders in the African National Congress, the party Mandela led, voted to abolish the anthem. It was seen as a racist relic because it brazenly celebrated the White conquest and subjugation of Black people. They voted to replace it with Nkosi Sikelel iAfrika, a stately, soulful ballad favored by Black South Africans. When Mandela heard about the decision, he was livid. \u201cWell, I am sorry. I don\u2019t want to be rude,\u201d Mandela started. \u201c\u2026 This song that you treat so easily holds the emotions of many people who you don\u2019t represent yet. With the stroke of a pen, you would take a decision to destroy the very \u2013 the only \u2013 basis that we are building upon: reconciliation.\u201d Mandela proposed instead that South Africa should have two national anthems. The White and Black South Africans anthems would both be sung one after one another at official ceremonies and other public events. His proposal was passed unanimously by the chastened ANC leadership. The anthem was a difficult choice, but it helped, says the Rev. Nontombi Naomi Tutu, a human rights activist, speaker and the daughter of Bishop Demond Tutu, the South African Nobel Peace Prize laureate. \u201cI still struggle with it,\u201d says Tutu, who is also the associate rector at an Episcopal church in Beverly Hills, California. \u201cWhen I get to the part of the Die Stem [the White national anthem], I still have to take a deep breath before I start singing, but I recognize that this was an attempt to say this is all part of our country\u2019s story.\u201d There is a legitimate debate about preserving racist monuments. Mandela, for example, never said that all relics from apartheid\u2019s past should be preserved. What\u2019s important, though, is that he grasped that the cultural symbols of the Afrikaners \u2013 their anthem, their love of rugby (which many Black South Africans disdained because it was seen as the sport of their oppressors) and their monuments \u2013 weren\u2019t just issues to argue about. It offered opportunities to reach them. That\u2019s why Mandela often spoke a few words of Afrikaans at the beginning of his speeches. It\u2019s why he publicly rallied behind South Africa\u2019s 1995 Rugby World Cup Final championship run, an enthralling sports story that was made into a Hollywood movie. And its why, Mandela later explained, he spent his years his prison learning Afrikaans, the language of his oppressor while studying their history and reading their favorite poets. Mandela once said of persuading many Afrikaners to accept him as their leader: \u201cYou don\u2019t address their brains; you address their hearts.\u201d That approach is how he disarmed Viljoen, the South African general who visited his home, Carlin the author says. Viljoen was considered a racist and a criminal by many Black South Africans. Carlin called him the \u201cultimate enforcer\u201d of apartheid because the system was built on the brute force of the South African military. Viljoen was Mandela\u2019s most dangerous adversary because he could have mobilzied a force of about 30,000 White South African soldiers who were ready to wage war for a White homeland. But Mandela charmed Viljoen by speaking to him in Afrikaans, the general\u2019s native language, while spinning parables about Afrikaner farmers who were tough but fair to Black people. Yet he also spoke bluntly to Viljoen about his own anger because he knew that directness was a trait that Afrikaners valued. Mandela knew what notes to hit because he had spent virtually 30 years addressing the hearts of Afrikaners who had imprisoned him. \u201cHe knows the general better than the general knows him,\u201d Carlin says of that meeting. Some may reduce Mandela\u2019s charm offensive had political manipulation, but Carlin and others says it went deeper. They say Mandela had a Lincolnesque ability to appeal to the better angels in his political opponent\u2019s nature. He treated them not as the globally reviled henchmen of a criminal regime built on racism, but also as leaders who could transcend their backgrounds. He knew on some level that they wanted to be seen as more than monsters and dangled opportunities before them to do so. \u201cMandela understood on some profound level that ultimately, whether you are Black or White, right wing or left wing, is ultimately a function of change things for which you have no control,\u201d Carlin says. \u201cPolitical views are like the dress you wear, but underneath them is a flesh and blood human being. If you cut through those and start finding the heart and appeal to their generosity, you\u2019re going to make them feel better about themselves.\u201d That\u2019s why Carlin and others observe a curious pattern when some of the toughest enforcers of apartheid talk about their relationship with Mandela. Many of them cry. Tutu says Mandela made the men realize on some level that apartheid had also victimized them. \u201cThey recognized that the dehumanization of Black South Africans had also led to the dehumanization of White South Africans,\u201d she says. \u201cThey could not fully live as human in a system that dehumanized the vast majority of South Africans.\u201d None of Mandela\u2019s empathy or sensitivity toward his enemy\u2019s culture would have made any difference if he didn\u2019t possess another quality. Calin calls it a \u201cdiamond-like\u201d integrity. The contemporary political scene is filled with slippery leaders who exude dishonesty and moral cowardice. A former president makes it to the White House despite being a habitual liar. A major political party embraces the \u201cbig lie\u201d that a presidential election was stolen. A never-ending stream of scandals routinely reveals the gap between a politician\u2019s public pronouncements and their private conduct. But many say there was little separation between the private and the public Mandela. Sure, he could disarm political opponents with public displays of empathy. But he did the same in private, treating everyone with what he called \u201cordinary respect.\u201d After Mandela left office, he heard that the now-adult son of his former jailer at died in a car accident. The infant boy he once held in a jail cell as he teared up was gone. He flew to his former jailer\u2019s home and spent the afternoon consoling him, Carlin says. \u201cThere was no political payoff to it,\u201d Carlin says. \u201cHe just did it out of kindness and loyalty.\u201d Mandela\u2019s integrity made his political opponents look small. In 1985, when South Africa\u2019s leadership felt the pressure of a growing international campaign to release Mandela, they offered him a deal. Reject violence as a tactic to fight apartheid, obey the country\u2019s security laws, and we will release you. Mandea refused. He composed a response to their offer that was read by one of his daughters at a packed rally in a stadium in Soweto, South Africa. \u201cI cherish my freedom dearly, but I care even more for your freedom,\u201d Mandela wrote. \u201cI cannot and will not give any undertaking at a time when I and you, the people, are not free. Your freedom and mine cannot be separated.\u201d Lies may offer politicians short-term gain, but Mandela\u2019s integrity proved instrumental for one of his greatest triumphs. When Viljoen, the South African general, was asked to identify the decisive factor that persuaded him to abandon leading an insurrection, he cited one person. \u201cThe character of the opponent \u2013 whether you can trust him, whether you believe he is genuinely for peace,\u201d Viljoen told Carlin in the book, \u201cInvictus.\u201d The important thing when you sit down and negotiate with the enemy is the character of the people you have across the table from you and whether they carry their people\u2019s support. Mandela had both.\u201d Viljoen\u2019s paid another public tribute when Mandela voluntarily relinquished power after serving one term as South Africa\u2019s first democratically elected President. He gave a speech praising Mandela in Parliament. This time he spoke in Mandela\u2019s native language, Xhosa. \u201cGo and have yourself a well-earned rest, Mr. President,\u201d Viljoen said as Mandela looked on. \u201cGo and lie in the shadow of a tall tree.\u201d Mandela died in 2013 at the age of 95. What he and countless other South Africans did seems like a miracle today. Their country is still afflicted by many socioeconomic divisions that linger from apartheid. But few are talking anymore about armed insurrections and a country splitting apart. But they are invoking those scenarios in the US today. Many commentators says the county is in the middle a political and cultural civil war. The FBI director recently said White supremacy represents the nation\u2019s biggest terrorist threat. The future looks scary, as it once did in South Africa. We need Mandela\u2019s example more than ever.",

            "article_content": " A year ago, rioters protesting the results of the 2020 election attacked the US Capitol building, infiltrating some of the most hallowed chambers of American democracy and setting off shockwaves of violence and division across the country. Much has happened since, but the consequences of that day continue to reverberate. Here\u2019s a look at the impact of this anniversary, plus everything else you need to Get Up to Speed and On with Your Day. (You can also get \u201c5 Things You Need to Know Today\u201d delivered to your inbox daily. Sign up here.) The House voted this week to create a select committee to investigate the deadly January 6 attack on the US Capitol \u2013 and it\u2019s immediately become a politically fraught assignment. Republicans have made it clear they\u2019re not interested, and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy even threatened to strip party members of other committee assignments if they accepted an offer from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to serve. So far, Republican Rep. Liz Cheney has been tapped as one of the Democratic House speaker\u2019s committee picks. Cheney was previously removed from GOP House leadership after repeatedly criticizing ex-President Trump\u2019s false election claims. Meanwhile, new video from the insurrection is prompting more legal action against people who were there. The Justice Department this week rounded up several new defendants accused of destroying thousands of dollars\u2019 worth of professional broadcast equipment. What\u2019s happening today: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has announced several events at the Capitol that will commemorate today\u2019s anniversary, including a prayer, a moment of silence on the House floor and a conversation led by two historians aimed at preserving narratives of the attack. Lawmakers will also share their accounts, and President Joe Biden is expected to deliver remarks later today. More local officials in the US are sounding the alarm over another possible wave of Covid-19 just as people are setting off for the July 4 holiday. For instance, places in Arkansas have seen a surge, and Gov. Asa Hutchinson says more than 90% of active virus cases are among unvaccinated people. To combat the spread of the Delta variant, the Biden administration is planning to deploy response teams across the US to areas with high infection rates. As for vaccines, Johnson & Johnson says data shows its vaccine provides immunity that lasts at least eight months and appears to provide adequate protection against the Delta variant. The CDC has updated its recommendations for the Pfizer/BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine booster to include children as young as 12, at least five months after they finish their primary set of shots. Separately, a bipartisan groups of senators floated the idea of more Covid-19 relief as event cancellations, closures and travel woes pile up due to skyrocketing Omicron cases. However, the talks failed to move forward. The Supreme Court has dealt a blow to the fight to preserve voting rights. The court yesterday ruled two provisions of an Arizona voting law that restrict how ballots can be cast do not violate the historic Voting Rights Act that bars regulations that result in racial discrimination. Critics see the ruling as essentially gutting what\u2019s left of the Voting Rights Act. This also means the restrictive voting laws that Republican-led states are implementing this year are more likely to withstand legal challenges. The decision also raises questions about the legacy of the court\u2019s 6-3 conservative majority. The Supreme Court term is now over, and attention is turning to Justice Stephen Breyer, the court\u2019s senior liberal who is facing intense calls to retire. A state of emergency has been declared in Kazakhstan after days of violent political unrest prompted by anger over increasing fuel prices, poor living standards and corruption. Protesters have set fire to city buildings and stormed the airport in the country\u2019s biggest city, Almaty. The Prime Minister and the government resigned during the chaos, causing even more tension. The public is now dealing with a nationwide internet blackout, and a Russian-led military alliance has reportedly deployed \u201cpeacekeeping\u201d personnel to help stabilize the situation. Rescue efforts at the Florida condo collapse site could face more challenges soon as a tropical storm approaches and risk of further collapse lingers. Work had to be halted for much of yesterday as engineers assessed the structure still standing. The rest of the building is expected to be demolished in coming weeks. Meanwhile, more ominous details from the years leading up to the collapse are coming to light. The building department in Surfside, Florida, was the target of mounting complaints by residents and contractors in late 2018 \u2013 so much so that the town manager at the time placed the office under administrative review. A family suing the Champlain Towers South condo association also claims an engineering firm that performed a 2018 structural analysis on the building should have been more thorough. Babies, pregnant women and nursing mothers are among the 97 hostages that have been freed in a series of rescue operations in northern Nigeria. Local police and the military collaborated on the raids, which targeted two well-known kingpins known for kidnapping in the area. Authorities say the hostages were held captive for more than two months. The Lower Kootenay Band, a member band of the Ktunaxa Nation, has announced the discovery of 182 human remains in unmarked graves at the site of another residential school in British Columbia. This site, near the city of Cranbrook, was formerly the St. Eugene\u2019s Mission School. This is the third boarding school where vast numbers of human remains have been identified. The discoveries have forced Canada to confront its history of systemic abuse of Indigenous communities, perpetuated in schools like these. The painful discoveries also led some Canadians to discourage celebrations during yesterday\u2019s Canada Day. Canada has announced a total of $31.5 billion in compensation for First Nations children who were taken from their families and put into the country\u2019s child welfare system. Half of the money will go toward the potentially hundreds of thousands of children affected, and the other half will be used to reform the system that failed them. Indigenous and human rights organizations have long said such systems discriminate against First Nations children. All US and coalition forces have left Bagram Air Base in Afghanistan The departure, according to a US defense official,\u00a0marks the end of the American presence at the sprawling compound that became the center of military power in Afghanistan. The full withdrawal of US troops from the country is expected very soon. Billionaire heiress gets married in a gown covered in mirror shards We\u2019re talking pandemic-wise.

            "article_content": "A group of civil rights organizations will host another March on Washington in August to demand that Congress pass sweeping voting rights legislation and that state lawmakers halt efforts to enact bills that restrict voting access. The announcement of the march comes one day after Senate Republicans blocked the For the People Act \u2013 a signature voting and election bill that Democrats had pitched to counter state-level efforts. Republicans denounced the bill as a partisan power grab and a federal overreach into state voting and election systems. The march, set for Aug. 28 with the theme \u201cMarch On for Voting Rights,\u201d will mark the 58th anniversary of the historic March on Washington where Martin Luther King Jr. delivered his famous \u201cI Have a Dream\u201d speech. Marches are set to be held in Washington DC, Atlanta, Miami, Phoenix and Houston. Senate Republicans block signature Democratic election bill in key test vote Martin Luther King III, the eldest son of Martin Luther King Jr., will lead the march with his family\u2019s organization the Drum Major Institute along with March On, Service Employees International Union and the National Action Network. King called it a \u201csad state of affairs\u201d that the voting bill didn\u2019t get the support it needed from Republicans. He said he hopes the march will not only energize people to take a stand against voting rights restrictions in their own states but to get millions more people registered to vote. \u201cWe are suggesting that we are going to continue to exert pressure on policymakers, our Republican senators who represent us in our states,\u201d King told CNN on Wednesday. \u201cThese 50 Republican senators decided that it\u2019s not even worth a discussion and that\u2019s pretty sad.\u201d Rev. Al Sharpton, who heads the National Action Network, said it is critical that Americans march to defend the right to vote. This year, 48 states have introduced 389 bills that would restrict voting access after record turnout in the 2020 election delivered victories for Democrats. Some of the restrictions include banning ballot drop boxes, cutting early voting days and hours, prohibiting serving food and beverages to voters waiting in line and limiting who can vote by mail. 'Dripping in the blood of Jim Crow': Voting rights groups say GOP-backed bills in Georgia target Black voters \u201cIt\u2019s time for all Americans to come together and join this non-violent, non-partisan movement in the spirit of Dr. King and the values he pushed this nation to uphold,\u201d Sharpton said. \u201cI\u2019m proud to be a part of the March On for Voting Rights because there is no democratic right more sacred than the right to vote, and it is under threat across America. We must fight to protect it.\u201d This will be the second consecutive year that organizers have commemorated the March on Washington with a renewed effort to fight for equality. Last year\u2019s Get Your Knee Off Our Necks Commitment March in Washington pushed for both federal voting rights legislation, police reform and came at the height of a racial reckoning sparked by George Floyd\u2019s death. Tens of thousands of people attended the march including several families of Black people who have been killed by police. And while demonstrators marched for both the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act or the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, neither has been passed.",

The Supreme Court has dismissed a challenge to the Affordable Care Act brought on by Republican-led states. The justices decided that the opponents in this case, who urged justices to dismiss the entire 2010 law, weren\u2019t actually harmed by ACA provisions because Congress has reduced the penalty for failing to buy health insurance to zero. This was the third major challenge to the landmark healthcare reform law, and while the decision has preserved the ACA for now, there will undoubtedly be more Republican challenges. One such lawsuit is currently brewing in Texas, in which a group of individuals and businesses are arguing that an ACA provision requiring insurers to offer certain free preventative services is unlawful. About 31 million Americans have health coverage through the Affordable Care Act. Juneteenth is now officially a federal holiday. President Joe Biden signed a bill into law yesterday commemorating June 19, 1865, the day slaves in Texas were told of their emancipation. Juneteenth is the first holiday to be approved since Martin Luther King Jr. Day, which was established in 1983. Since Juneteenth falls on a weekend this year, some state government offices may be closed today in observance. Juneteenth gained wider recognition following the wave of racial justice activism last summer. While many have welcomed the new holiday, other nationwide issues related to race and equality are still being met with division. Congress is all but stalled on police reform legislation, debates are roiling about teaching critical race theory in schools, and several states have passed or are trying to pass laws threatening the voting rights of underserved communities. The Biden administration has announced it will invest more than $3 billion for the discovery, development and manufacturing of Covid-19 antiviral medicines, like a pill someone could easily take at home early in an illness. Meanwhile, the US is still trying to reach a goal, set by President Biden, of at least partially vaccinating 70% of the adult population by July 4. Experts continue to sound the warning of possibly dangerous consequences if the US doesn\u2019t meet such thresholds. In Indonesia, hundreds of health workers have been sickened with Covid-19 even though they received the Sinovac vaccine, raising even more questions about the efficacy of some vaccines against more infectious variants. Voters are heading to the polls today in Iran for a controversial election that is all but guaranteed to deliver a hardline president after all the other serious contenders were barred from the race. The practically uncontested frontrunner is Ebrahim Raisi, a close associate of Iran\u2019s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei. Raisi lost a 2017 election and has headed the country\u2019s judiciary for the last two years. He emerged as the likely victor after an election supervisory body barred his main rivals from the race in a widely criticized move. If he wins, Raisi and his government will have to confront an economic crisis exacerbated by the Covid-19 pandemic, calls for constitutional reform and growing questions around the succession plans for Khamenei, 81, who is the final arbiter of all Iranian affairs. A coronavirus outbreak in a powerful shipping region in China could end up snarling holiday shopping, even though the holidays are half a year away. Last month, authorities in the southern Chinese province of Guangdong \u2013 home to some of the world\u2019s busiest container ports \u2013 canceled flights, locked down communities and suspended trade along its coastline to bring a rapid spike in Covid-19 cases under control. Things have improved, but the shipping damage is already done. The shutdown created a huge backlog of shipping containers and vessels waiting to dock. This congestion has led major shipping companies to warn clients of delays, changes to vessel routes and destinations and spikes in fees. The whole situation could take months to clear.

The White House is cranking up pressure as talks drag on with Republicans over President Biden\u2019s ambitious yet divisive infrastructure plans. The administration had hoped for a deal on the proposal, originally tagged at $2.2 trillion, by Memorial Day. However, there\u2019s still a $700 billion gap between Biden\u2019s original proposal and the GOP\u2019s counterproposals. There are fears among the President\u2019s allies that this ongoing inertia could lead to a \u201csummer slump\u201d that often happens in the first year of a presidency, when unanticipated challenges at home and abroad slow down the early months of a president\u2019s legislative momentum. What\u2019s happening today: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has announced several events at the Capitol that will commemorate today\u2019s anniversary, including a prayer, a moment of silence on the House floor and a conversation led by two historians aimed at preserving narratives of the attack. Lawmakers will also share their accounts, and President Joe Biden is expected to deliver remarks later today. Half the US population is now at least partially vaccinated, which means health experts are less concerned about the crowds that gathered at beaches, bars and other venues over the holiday weekend. Still, they warn that those who aren\u2019t vaccinated remain at great risk of serious illness from Covid-19. The next goal? Biden wants to get 70% of the population at least partially vaccinated by July 4. Meanwhile, the World Health Organization has assigned new labels to key coronavirus variants so the public can refer to them by letters of the Greek alphabet instead of where the variant was first detected. For instance, the UK variant that made its way around the US is now variant Alpha, and the one responsible for India\u2019s most recent deadly surge is Delta. The CDC has updated its recommendations for the Pfizer/BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine booster to include children as young as 12, at least five months after they finish their primary set of shots. Separately, a bipartisan groups of senators floated the idea of more Covid-19 relief as event cancellations, closures and travel woes pile up due to skyrocketing Omicron cases. However, the talks failed to move forward. Texas has become the next battleground in the voting rights fight after state Democrats successfully derailed a restrictive voting bill. Legislators walked off the state House floor late Sunday night, leaving majority Republicans without the quorum they needed to approve the bill before a midnight deadline. The bill would make mail-in voting more difficult, ban early voting on Sunday mornings and prohibit local elections officials from sending out absentee ballot applications to anyone who has not requested one. The measure may be dead for now, but Gov. Greg Abbott made it clear the issue will be top of mind during the next legislative session. States like Georgia and Florida have already passed similarly restrictive voting measures based on falsehoods promoted by former President Trump that the outcome of the 2020 election was somehow fraudulent. A state of emergency has been declared in Kazakhstan after days of violent political unrest prompted by anger over increasing fuel prices, poor living standards and corruption. Protesters have set fire to city buildings and stormed the airport in the country\u2019s biggest city, Almaty. The Prime Minister and the government resigned during the chaos, causing even more tension. The public is now dealing with a nationwide internet blackout, and a Russian-led military alliance has reportedly deployed \u201cpeacekeeping\u201d personnel to help stabilize the situation. Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s 12-year tenure as Israeli Prime Minister could be coming to an end after two political rivals announced they are working toward forming a new government in the Knesset, the country\u2019s parliament. Naftali Bennett, leader of the small right-wing party Yamina, said he is working toward a coalition deal with centrist party leader Yair Lapid to avoid a fifth round of elections, the prior of which have failed to produce a new government. If successful, Netanyahu \u2013 who faces an ongoing trial on bribery and fraud charges \u2013 will be ousted as Israel\u2019s longest-serving PM. Lapid now needs to reach and sign formal coalition agreements with the eight parties involved. Parliament then has a week to vote on the coalition arrangements before the new government \u2013 and a new Israeli prime minister \u2013 could be sworn in. Today marks the start of the Atlantic hurricane season, but the first named storm is already in the books. Subtropical Storm Ana formed in the Atlantic 10 days ago, marking the seventh year in a row when at least one named storm formed prior to the official start of the season. Hurricanes are getting deadlier and deadlier as oceans and the air around them heat up due to the climate crisis. Rising sea levels also raise the risk of destructive storm surges. As we gear up for another potentially dangerous season, Amazon and the Red Cross are partnering on a new disaster hub that will allow for a faster response to locations hit by hurricanes and other natural disasters. And coastal Catholics are calling on a more divine go-between: Our Lady of Prompt Succor, a version of the Virgin Mary known to protect from storms. Canada has announced a total of $31.5 billion in compensation for First Nations children who were taken from their families and put into the country\u2019s child welfare system. Half of the money will go toward the potentially hundreds of thousands of children affected, and the other half will be used to reform the system that failed them. Indigenous and human rights organizations have long said such systems discriminate against First Nations children.

            "article_content": "They tell me I\u2019ve experienced a \u201cracial reckoning.\u201d I keep seeing that phrase pop up in news stories. I hear politicians and CEOs use the term as if there\u2019s no doubt it\u2019s true.  I even put the phrase in one of my own headlines without ever asking myself what a racial reckoning meant. It\u2019s hard to avoid using that phrase, because it reflects a consensus. A year after the death of George Floyd, many Americans routinely describe the protests that followed last summer as a singular, racially transformative moment. But I\u2019ve reached an uncomfortable conclusion: Floyd\u2019s death did not lead to a racial reckoning. And those who care about racial justice should welcome the absence of one \u2013 or at least the version I\u2019m talking about. The \u201cracial reckoning\u201d phrase has become a rhetorical decoy, a way to avoid facing the deepest problems about race in America instead of a call to confront them. I know that sounds blasphemous. Floyd\u2019s death sparked what some called the largest protest movement in US history. White support for the Black Lives Matter reached an all-time high. Demonstrators toppled Confederate monuments. And so many people bought books on antiracism that booksellers had trouble keeping them in stock. It seemed as if we were finally turning the corner. Maryland lawmakers passed a series of police reforms that limited no-knock warrants. The Seattle City Council banned chokeholds and tear gas by police. Small predominantly White towns held Black Lives Matter rallies. A renowned Yale University professor described the wave of protests as an \u201cawakening\u201d that is \u201crare in our history.\u201d \u201cThis is the time to strike, the time to take audacious steps to address systemic racial inequality \u2013 bold, sweeping reparative action,\u201d Yale psychologist Jennifer Richeson wrote in an essay last September. Yet look at what happened in the months after the US experienced its racial \u201cawakening\u201d following Floyd\u2019s death last May. A group of audacious Americans did strike \u2013 at the heart of our democracy. A mob staged a \u201cWhite riot\u201d on the US Capitol in an attempt to overturn the results of last year\u2019s presidential election. Former President Trump, viewed by many as a racist, received more votes than any other presidential candidate in history except for his opponent. And Republican lawmakers in more than 45 states are now mounting what some call the most sustained assault against Black civil rights since the Jim Crow era by introducing more than at least 361 bills to restrict voting, according to an analysis by the Brennan Center for Justice. So why do we keep saying that the country has experienced a racial reckoning? Part of it is habit. White America has been telling itself that it is experiencing a racial awakening for decades. These awakenings are like the cicadas that emerge every 17 years. The phrase resurfaces in headlines whenever some shocking act of racial brutality happens and White America is shocked and moved to tears. Then the moral outrage fades and the news cycle moves on. The evidence of these periodic racial awakenings can be found in old news clippings. \u201cRacial Reckoning Goes to the North.\u201d That was the headline from a story in an August 1974 issue of the Palm Beach Post, which described the furious resistance Northern Whites mounted against busing Black children to their virtually all-White public schools. \u201cFacing a racial reckoning.\u201d That was a headline in a 1987 story in the Christian Science Monitor that described the hate civil rights demonstrators encountered when they marched in a White rural country in Georgia. \u201cA day of racial reckoning.\u201d That\u2019s how one Associated Press reporter described The Million Man March on Washington in 1995. If we keep on having so many racial reckonings, why does it feel like nothing has changed for so many people of color? It\u2019s because we\u2019ve been living with two contrasting definitions of a racial reckoning. For some, a racial reckoning occurs when enough White people suddenly realize that the country\u2019s racial problems are much worse than they thought. It\u2019s often triggered by a brutal image, like the photographs of police dogs lunging at Black demonstrators in Birmingham, Alabama. Or Floyd going limp as a White police officer placed his knee on his neck. It\u2019s that moment of shock that meshes with how the dictionary defines the word, reckoning: an \u201cappraisal or judgment,\u201d a \u201ccomputation\u201d or \u201ccounting of the cost.\u201d Such moments have led to transformative change. The images from Birmingham helped lead to the passage of the 1964 Civil Rights Act, which struck down segregation in public accommodations. That the was the history a BBC correspondent Nick Bryant was thinking of last May when he became the first journalist to use the term \u201cracial reckoning\u201d in connection with Floyd\u2019s death, according to a LexisNexis search.  Bryant wrote a 600-word story declaring that the US is \u201cnow in the midst of another racial reckoning.\u201d \u201cIt struck me as a historical moment, like the pictures of the police dogs lunging at protestors in the streets of Birmingham or the Rodney King beating,\u201d says Bryant, author of the book, \u201cWhen America Stopped Being Great: A History of the Present.\u201d \u201cAs somebody who studied the civil rights movement,\u201d he says, \u201cI knew those kinds of moments led to a reckoning and led to change.\u201d But there is another definition of racial reckoning that many people of color and their White allies subscribe to. In this definition, the emphasis is not on White remorse but on fundamental change. And the expectation is nothing less than a dramatic improvement in the lives of ordinary people of color. Can we honestly say that life is dramatically different for people of color one year after Floyd\u2019s death? The sheer Groundhog Day repetition of seeing one Black person after another die on camera is one reason why some people are furious about the recent shooting of Daunte Wright, a young Black man killed during a traffic stop in Minnesota. The shooting led to nights of protests outside the Brooklyn Center Police Department. Jelani Cobb, a writer for The New Yorker, wrote a recent column on the trial of Derek Chauvin, the officer accused of killing Floyd, in which he asked what has changed since last year\u2019s protests. Cobb cited some changes: the \u201cmercenary corporate endorsements of the phrase \u2018Black Lives Matter\u2019 as well as substantial legislative and policy changes in policing.\u201d He then added: \u201cThe biggest question surrounding this raft of changes has been whether it will translate into a decreased likelihood of Black people dying during routine interactions with law enforcement \u2026 The answer to that question, at least from the vantage point of the hundreds of people who have gathered outside the Brooklyn Center police station for the past two nights, is no.\u201d There\u2019s a hard truth many learn if you\u2019re a person of color. White tears aren\u2019t a sufficient substitute for fundamental change. Sometimes they can even be an enemy of racial progress. It\u2019s far easier for some White people to embrace the symbolic gestures of racial solidarity \u2013 buying the latest anti-racist book, planting a Black Lives Matter sign on their lawn \u2013 than to do the hard work of making racially transformative change possible. Why should a White parent choose to remain in a neighborhood that\u2019s turning majority Black when it\u2019s far easier to slap a Black Lives Matter bumper sticker on their Toyota Prius as they move to an almost all-White neighborhood? Some call this pattern of White behavior \u201cperformative activism.\u201d What then, does a real racial reckoning look like? Some of it includes ending mass incarceration, eliminating restrictions on voting and reforming a public school system that allows affluent neighborhoods to provide more funding to their public schools than poor ones. But get into the details of how that is done, and the \u201cBlack Lives Matter!\u201d chants start to trail off. When I asked Matthew Delmont, a history professor at Dartmouth College, why busing \u2013 an attempt in the late 1960s and early 1970s to racially integrate public schools \u2013 failed in Northern cities like Boston, he said many White people wouldn\u2019t support the civil rights movement if it meant that they had to give up something. Real change can\u2019t happen unless White people are willing to give up some power and resources where they live, said Delmont, author of \u201cWhy Busing Failed: Race, Media, and the National Resistance to School Desegregation.\u201d \u201cThe sign that change is real as opposed to symbolic is that people are making real changes to things close to them in their own backyards, such as supporting more affordable housing in their neighborhood, and programs that would integrate schools,\u201d says Delmont. But a real racial reckoning has to go even deeper than that. That belief is not abstract for me. It\u2019s a reflection of my peculiar upbringing. I used to believe that if enough White Americans saw enough videos like the one of Floyd\u2019s death, a critical mass of people would be finally be awakened and attack our race problems once and for all. I no longer believe that. How many more videos like Floyd\u2019s do some White people need to see? I\u2019ve learned what social science has already confirmed through multiple experiments: Human beings have an almost inexhaustible ability to deny what they see or hear if it doesn\u2019t confirm to their preexisting beliefs. I have seen something, though, that changes people\u2019s racial attitudes in ways I didn\u2019t anticipate. This is the missing ingredient to a true racial reckoning. It\u2019s called \u201cradical integration.\u201d The term \u201cintegration\u201d is outdated and uncool. America tried that and it failed. The concept conjures images of meek and earnest Black people trying to assimilate into White spaces while trying to not make them too nervous. But there is another, more demanding form of integration that Sheryll Cashin, an author and law professor at Georgetown University, has called the \u201cunfinished business of the civil rights movement.\u201d She\u2019s written that the US can\u2019t solve its \u201cconundrum of race\u201d until more White people start building relationships with non-White people and learn to accept their cultural norms. And Black people in turn must pursue changes in policy and laws to achieve racial justice. She and other race scholars talk about a form of integration that\u2019s \u201cmutually transformative.\u201d It\u2019s not just about placing Black people in proximity to Whites. Floyd\u2019s death didn\u2019t create any new momentum for building more interracial relationships. Much of America\u2019s public schools and neighborhoods remain racially segregated. One widely cited 2014 survey found that about 75% of White Americans don\u2019t have a single non-White friend. Many of us have become what Cashin calls \u201cintegration weary.\u201d  We\u2019ve tacitly accepted a contemporary version of the \u201cseparate but equal\u201d doctrine that was used to justify Jim Crow. White people won\u2019t stop seeing Black men as thugs or predators unless they actually get to know some, she says. \u201cThe best way for others to be humanized is for you to make a friend that is not of your own race,\u201d says Cashin, author of the forthcoming book, \u201cWhite Space, Black Hood: Opportunity Hoarding and Segregation in the Age of Inequality.\u201d \u201cIf you got a situation where something like 75% of Whites live in a very White space, how is that going to happen?\u201d she says. All this talk about integration may seem like a \u201cKumbaya\u201d dream, but I know from personal experience how mutually transformative building such interracial relationships can be. I\u2019ve had my own experience with radical integration. I was raised in an all-Black neighborhood in West Baltimore where few residents wanted to have anything to do with White people. The HBO series, \u201cThe Wire,\u201d was set in my community, and the 2015 Freddie Gray riots erupted just two blocks from my childhood home. Nobody told me to dislike or distrust White people. This hostility to White people hung in the air like humidity in my community. I couldn\u2019t see it, but it seeped into my pores. I, too, saw White police officers brutalize Black people. I was about 9 years old when I saw a White police officer tackle and savagely beat a Black woman in front of me who he suspected of shoplifting. Yet my hostility toward White people was complicated by one inconvenient fact: My mother was White. Her family shunned me at birth because my father was Black. I didn\u2019t meet my mother or any members of that side of my family until I was 17. I had to learn to love people who had my father jailed when he first tried to date my mother. It was one of the best things to ever happen to me. There was no diversity manual I could consult when I learned that my mother called my father a \u201cn***er\u201d during an argument. All the fancy knowledge about systemic racism I gained as a journalist covering race was utterly useless when I had to look into the eyes of a White relative who rejected me at birth and decide whether I could say yes to her plea to forgive her. What changed me was the time spent building personal relationships with this other half of my racial identity. There were years of tense meetings, furious exchanges of letters but gradually the anger I felt at them was replaced by something else: a resolve to never define a person, or a group of people, by their worst acts. And now the same people who I wanted nothing to do with are family. Unless we pursue these relationships as eagerly as we should pursue changes in laws and policy, there will be no racial reckoning in this country. There will be, unfortunately, more videos like Floyd\u2019s. They never seem to stop. And neither will some of the ritualized forms of White grief that follow. People will put Black Lives Matter signs on their front porches, CEOs will release statements of support and some White people will once again talk about a new \u201cracial reckoning.\u201d A year after many brave and well-meaning White people hit the streets to protest Floyd\u2019s death, I\u2019m still grateful for what I see and hear from many of our White allies. But I wonder if too many are preoccupied with adopting the symbolic gestures of the latest racial reckoning \u2014 without being willing to pay the price for real change.",

            "article_content": "We lost civil rights icons. They lost friends. The Rev. Jesse Jackson, Xernona Clayton and Andrew Young are some of the last remaining members of a generation of civil rights activists who reshaped the US and challenged their country to become a genuine multiracial democracy. But they are also survivors who have witnessed some of their closest friends in the movement die during a sobering stretch over the past year. John Lewis. The Rev. C.T. Vivian. The Rev. Joseph Lowery.  Vernon Jordan. All towering figures, all now gone. \u201cThey\u2019re still a few of us around, but not really many,\u201d says Young, who was one of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.\u2019s most trusted advisers. \u201cWhen a few of us get together we always start with the song, \u2018By and by, when the morning comes. All of the saints of God will gather home. We\u2019ll tell the story of how we\u2019ve overcome, and we\u2019ll understand it better by and by.\u2019\u201d The three icons can\u2019t help but be reflective for another reason. As the nation marks the one-year anniversary of the murder of George Floyd, these leaders are taking stock of how Floyd\u2019s death has transformed America \u2013 and how so much change is still needed. In recent interviews with CNN\u2019s Suzanne Malveaux, the three offered their perspectives on Floyd\u2019s death and addressed a new generation of activists who may be dismayed that more progress hasn\u2019t been made since last year. But given their personal losses, the conversations also drifted into other topics: Their memories of their departed friends, how they approach their own mortality and why they\u2019re still hopeful about the future. A remarkable moment occurred when Young, the former US ambassador to the United Nations, was being interviewed by CNN about his civil rights activism and its connection to Floyd\u2019s death. Young, 89, was chatting about the links between the Floyd protests and his time with King when he recalled a stark warning that the civil rights leader used to deliver to his closest aides: Most of us are probably not going to make it past 40. \u201cHe didn\u2019t make it to 40. He made it to 39,\u201d Young says about King. \u201cSome of the rest of us who made it are obligated to keep on trying. There is no giving up, no giving in, no retirement because we\u2019ve come too far from where we started from. And nobody told us that the way would be easy, but I don\u2019t believe he brought us this far to leave us\u2026\u201d Young couldn\u2019t finish the thought, though. He stopped speaking in mid-sentence, closed his eyes, and turned away from the camera. He was about to cry. It\u2019s hard not to get emotional given Young\u2019s experience. He\u2019s seen the best and worst of America. He was viciously beaten by racist thugs in 1964 in St. Augustine, Florida during a march for racial justice.  A White mob pelted him with rocks and cherry bombs during another demonstration in Chicago two years later. And he was with King in 1968 when the civil rights leader was assassinated in Memphis. But Young also became the first African American ambassador to the United Nations. He helped draft two epic civil rights laws: The Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act of 1965. And he saw the state of Georgia turn blue during last year\u2019s presidential election and deliver control of Congress to the Democratic Party by electing a Black man and a Jewish man to the US Senate. To those activists who may be disenchanted that more hasn\u2019t changed since Floyd\u2019s death, Young said his generation always knew that their work was a long grind. \u201cFreedom is a constant struggle,\u201d he says. Young says Floyd won\u2019t be forgotten. \u201cI would say to these young people, we\u2019re not ever going to be able to get George Floyd out of our systems, as we will never forget Martin Luther King or John Lewis. And we shouldn\u2019t. \u201d When asked about police brutality against people of color and other forms of racial violence, Young says racism persists because it\u2019s built on a lie. \u201cOur country has been founded on the myth that Black people are inferior,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd everybody White is taught to believe that.\u201d Young points out that enslaved Black people helped build this country. \u201cNobody coming from Europe as an indentured servant knew anything about agriculture or hunting,\u201d he says. \u201cThey were picked up off the streets of London and brought here and just dumped. And if it hadn\u2019t been for the skills of the Black people and then Native Americans, nobody could have survived.\u201d Thinking of the friends he\u2019s lost, Young says activists like Lewis and Vivian decided they were \u201cwilling to march into hell for a heavenly cause.\u201d He made the same decision, and he has no regrets. He says facing the mob in Florida was more important to him than receiving a Presidential Medal of Freedom. \u201cI can\u2019t think of a happier life,\u201d Young says.\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t imagine anybody that had a better life than I had.\u201d One of the most enduring images to come from last year\u2019s summer of protest was the racial makeup of the crowds. Many of the protesters were White, and they stood shoulder to shoulder with people of color, taking rubber bullets to the face and swallowing tear gas to protest racial injustice. They were in essence a mini-Rainbow Coalition. The Rev. Jesse Jackson helped popularize that term to describe the multiracial America he envisioned. His Rainbow Coalition, which included Blacks, Whites, Latinos, Asians, Native Americans and LGBTQ people, helped pave the way for a more progressive Democratic Party. \u201cOur flag is red, white and blue, but our nation is a rainbow \u2013 red, yellow, brown, Black and White \u2013 and we\u2019re all precious in God\u2019s sight,\u201d Jackson once said. Jackson, 79, saw a new form of his coalition take to the streets last summer, but he says today there\u2019s more work to do. He experienced a measure of satisfaction when Derek Chauvin, a White police officer, was found guilty last month of murdering Floyd. \u201cI felt good, but I knew it was limited because it was a first down and not a touchdown,\u201d Jackson says. Jackson says he still can\u2019t get the video of Floyd\u2019s death out of his mind. \u201cIt touched me when it happened in real time, because I could see him begging to live. Begging to live. Let me breathe. They had a knee on his neck and the other two (officers) just standing there,\u201d he says. \u201cCan you imagine if that had been a Black policeman on a White man\u2019s neck? You can bet the nation would have been turned upside down.\u201d Jackson, who is suffering from Parkinson\u2019s Disease, responds quickly when asked what lessons contemporary activists can learn from his generation. \u201cMass coalitions. Multi-racial, Multi-cultural coalitions,\u201d he says. Jackson says people can\u2019t give into paralyzing cynicism because they think change isn\u2019t happening fast enough. \u201cWe cannot give up the country, we cannot let darkness cast shadow on our light. We must see our way through this,\u201d he says.  \u201cRacism is unscientific. There\u2019s no science for a superior race or inferior race.\u201d The light is dimming on the generation that Jackson helped lead. Many of his friends and colleagues have died. \u201cIt gets lonesome,\u201d he says when asked about their passing. He thinks about King often. \u201cI miss him very much,\u201d Jackson says. But he also feels pride, not just sadness, when he thinks about friends like Lewis and Vivian \u2013 \u201ca generation that made things happen,\u201d he says. \u201cBrought light where there was darkness. Hope where there was despair. We\u2019re a new America today.\u201d When asked how he\u2019d like to be remembered, Jackson says: \u201cNever stopped fighting. Never stopped trying.\u201d Commentators often freeze-frame King as a solemn, Mount Rushmore-like figure who seemed almost superhuman at times. But Xernona Clayton was one of the few people who saw another side of King. And she, along with some mischievous friends, were able to summon that unguarded side of King in a moment that was caught on film. King had just finished a meeting with a group of civil rights leaders when a group of his friends surrounded him and began to sing happy birthday. Clayton, who was a close friend of King and his wife, Coretta Scott King, then presented him with a gag gift \u2013 a tin cup that people could drop coins and bills in to help fight poverty. King looked at Clayton, threw his head back and roared with laughter \u2013 a deep, rumbling laugh that echoed through the room. It\u2019s shocking to see King look so happy and relaxed. The surprise birthday party came four months before his assassination. Clayton, 90, says they were trying to lighten the load for King, who had been abandoned by many allies in the final year of his life over his opposition to the Vietnam War. \u201cWe couldn\u2019t get laughter out of him for any purpose,\u201d Clayton says. \u201cIt was Jesse and Andy. They said Xernona\u2019s the one who could change this.\u201d Clayton worked with King at the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, the organization he co-founded, and traveled extensively with him and his wife. After King\u2019s death, she helped desegregate hospitals in Atlanta and once persuaded a Grand Dragon of the Ku Klux Klan to denounce the Klan. She also was one of King\u2019s closest confidants during the last years of his life when he was losing popularity and donors stopped giving to the SCLC. \u201cHis world changed,\u201d she said in another recent interview. \u201cHis friends left him. The money dried up. And he was so disappointed. So disappointed,\u201d she said during a recent interview. \u201c\u2026He would just bare his soul to me. And I\u2019m walking around today with some of his secrets. Because some things he didn\u2019t want known about him: how disappointed he was that the world just turned against him. I always say now that the man died from a broken heart.\u201d Clayton was also a woman in a movement that didn\u2019t typically welcome women as leaders. When she watches the Floyd protests she notices the many women leaders and demonstrators of different races. The Black Lives Matter movement, for example, was founded by women. \u201cAnd so with the Black Lives Matter movement, you saw them from the beginning \u2013 more women than we ever had \u2026 and Whites in great numbers,\u201d she says.  \u201cDidn\u2019t matter who you were, what you looked like. We got a problem in America. Let\u2019s see if we can help do something about it. So I give them lots of credit. I really do.\u201d But she\u2019s dismayed that a new generation is fighting some of the same battles her generation fought. Her home state of Georgia is one of many that have passed new voting laws that will make it harder for people of color to vote. \u201cWe get one thing solved and you realize you got to go back and do it again,\u201d she says. \u201cWe don\u2019t have the commitment in America yet where all of us should be treated equally and fairly.\u201d Like Jackson and Young, she\u2019s also grieving the loss of old friends. She was close to Lewis and Vivian, two legendary civil right leaders. She says the two men were special \u2013 devoted to the cause \u2013 even when the cameras weren\u2019t rolling. It\u2019s a message she tries to share with kids who see Lewis and others as larger-than-life figures. \u201cThey left their mark here,\u201d she tells them. \u201cFollow their lead.\u201d She also tells them that Lewis didn\u2019t need a public relations firm to inflate his exploits. \u201cThat was the real John Lewis. That was a man who walked this earth,\u201d she says. When the talk turns to her legacy, Clayton says she can\u2019t believe her good fortune. \u201cI\u2019m so blessed,\u201d she says. \u201cI can\u2019t thank the good Lord enough. I know he\u2019s tired of me thanking him.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Three years ago, a video went viral of a group of teenage students chanting the n-word at a private party in Southlake, Texas. Now, as the school district tries to incorporate cultural awareness into the curriculum, a group of parents is fighting back. Southlake is not a racist community \u2013 that was the consensus among many parents at a school board meeting for the Carroll Independent School District in Southlake on Monday. The meeting took place after the city\u2019s elections over the weekend, which saw huge wins for candidates opposing the district\u2019s plans. Two candidates for school board, two for city council and the mayoral candidate all won with about 70% of the vote. They were all endorsed by the Southlake Families PAC, a group whose main issue is Carroll ISD\u2019s new Cultural Competence Action Plan, which was formed in response to that 2018 viral video. The plan, which was set to be presented for adoption last August before being postponed, aims to address racism in the district by emphasizing \u201ccultural awareness\u201d among students through anti-bullying programs and assembly speakers, according to a draft. It also requires things like diversity training for the staff. All of that is opposed by the Southlake Families PAC. On its website, the political action committee calls the plan \u201csome of the most extreme liberal positions in the history of Texas public education,\u201d saying the plan is \u201coverreaching\u201d and will \u201cindoctrinate children according to extremely liberal beliefs.\u201d The PAC\u2019s website acknowledges that racism is a problem but says the plan is not a solution: \u201cWe affirm that real racism remains an issue across the globe, and while rare in Southlake, we stand against it. We deny the current CCAP is a solution to any racist issues and, in fact, creates more racism, not less.\u201d At Monday\u2019s school board meeting, many parents and community members echoed those positions while referencing the winning results from the weekend\u2019s election. \u201cSeventy percent of our community disagreed with critical race theory,\u201d one person stated. \u201cSeventy percent deny there is systemic racism at Carroll ISD.\u201d Though the plan does not mention critical race theory specifically, the area of study has become a catch-all for any type of education involving race. The actual plan, however, is focused on cultural awareness, referencing the \u201cincreasingly diverse student population\u201d in the district. \u201cIndoctrination of children is over,\u201d said another speaker. Southlake is a suburb of Dallas-Fort Worth. The city is 79% White, and the median income is about $240,000, according to the US Census Bureau. Following the election over the weekend, the Southlake Families PAC wrote on Twitter, \u201cCritical Race Theory ain\u2019t coming here. This is what happens when good people stand up and say, not in my town, not on my watch.\u201d What critical race theory is -- and isn't A few days later, the group expanded on that position. \u201cCRT is a theoretical framework which views society as dominated by white supremacy and categorizes people as \u2018privileged\u2019 or \u2018oppressed\u2019 based on their skin color,\u201d the group wrote Monday. \u201cIt also teaches kids to hate America. Ask yourself who in their right mind would want this taught in public schools?\u201d CNN emailed the group for further comment, but did not receive a response. The entire situation \u2013 the finger-pointing at critical race theory, the emphasis on indoctrination and the general vilifying of racial education \u2013 is part of a larger trend currently playing out across the United States. Just last week, Idaho moved to ban \u201ccritical race theory\u201d or any racial education in its public schools, including public universities. Though the bill phrased the move as a ban against teaching that \u201cany sex, race, ethnicity, religion, color, or national origin is inherently superior or inferior,\u201d supporters of the bill called out critical race theory specifically, and also claimed students were being indoctrinated \u2013 just like in Southlake. Tuesday, former South Carolina Gov. Nikki Haley wrote on Twitter, \u201cCritical race theory is harmful to a child\u2019s education,\u201d posted above a short video with a graphic reading, \u201cSchools need to stop teaching kids that they\u2019re racist.\u201d Critical race theory, according to those that study it, actually refers to an area of study dedicated to understanding systemic inequality and racism in the United States, arguing that historical systems such as slavery still play a role in society today. \u201cIt\u2019s an approach to grappling with a history of White supremacy that rejects the belief that what\u2019s in the past is in the past,\u201d Kimberl\u00e9 Crenshaw, a founding critical race theorist and a law professor at UCLA and Columbia University, told CNN in October. On the other side is a group called the Southlake Anti-Racism Coalition, a group of past and present Carroll ISD students fighting for change in the district. The group\u2019s demands, according to its website, display an opposite approach to that of the Southlake Families PAC. \u201cWe demand that Carroll Independent School District is actively anti-racist and dismantles their complicity in systemic racism and bigotry. We demand action now,\u201d the group states. Several members of SARC, all of whom graduated from Carroll ISD, spoke with CNN. In regard to the 2018 video that sparked the Cultural Competence Action Plan, all said they weren\u2019t surprised the behavior occurred. \u201cThat happens all the time at Carroll schools,\u201d said Raven Rolle, a 2019 graduate of the district. \u201cI think most people\u2019s reaction in the city was just, \u2018Let\u2019s just leave them alone, they\u2019re getting a lot of hate from this,\u2019 \u2026 not really focusing on the fact that it was racist.\u201d Rolle, who is Black, recalled multiple experiences where White peers used the n-word. Though she reported them to school officials, she says they were never penalized. CNN contacted Carroll ISD multiple times via email and phone to verify these incidents, but did not receive a response. Rolle recalled one specific incident in which a student repeatedly used the word. When she went to the principal\u2019s office to report them, she said the other student denied the whole thing. Meanwhile, she said, the principal told her, \u201cJust don\u2019t let them dim your light, you\u2019ll be fine.\u201d Shawn Duhon, the principal of Carroll Senior High School, said in an email to CNN that he \u201ccannot comment on the specifics of a student or a discipline situation.\u201d \u201cI can acknowledge that there was an incident reported to our Admin Team by a student a couple of weeks before graduation and as an administrator, we worked with the parents of both students involved to address the concern,\u201d Duhon wrote. One former student, who requested anonymity for safety reasons, said they were called the n-word every day during class for two years. \u201cNo one asked me if I was OK, no one did anything to show that they cared about me,\u201d they said. \u201cI didn\u2019t know what to do. I was like, 14.\u201d They are now in their early 20s. CNN spoke with another former student who said she was in class when these instances occurred. This student said, \u201cIt definitely happened. I don\u2019t know that it happened every single day, but there were multiple instances throughout our time \u2026 together\u201d in class. CNN reached out multiple times to the two instructors who taught the class at the time for a statement, but did not receive a response. The problem, several former students said, is that using the slur is often seen as just bullying, not racism. And the faculty doesn\u2019t always see it as a problem, said Maddy Heymann, who graduated in 2017. She used \u201cTo Kill a Mockingbird,\u201d a book they were required to read, as an example. \u201cSomeone in the class will say the n-word when reading the book,\u201d Heymann said, \u201cbecause teachers think it\u2019s an important part about reading the book, when it just further proliferates the idea that it\u2019s an acceptable word to say.\u201d The proposed Cultural Competence Action Plan isn\u2019t perfect, several students said. Anya Kushwaha, who graduated in 2016, noted that the 34-page document references racism only once, and doesn\u2019t address systemic or institutionalized issues. Instead, it focuses mainly on preventing bullying and increasing \u201ccultural awareness.\u201d But it\u2019s better than nothing, Kushwaha said. \u201cAt the bare, bare minimum, any semblance of a plan like this is necessary just because of how far off we are,\u201d they said.",

            "article_content": "The family of Tamir Rice sent a letter to Attorney General Merrick Garland Friday asking him to reopen the investigation into the boy\u2019s 2014 shooting death and to convene a grand jury to consider charges against the Cleveland police officers who killed him. Former\u00a0AG William Barr announced in December that the Justice Department would not pursue criminal charges in Rice\u2019s death, saying there was not enough conclusive evidence against the police officers. Justice Department won't pursue charges against officers in Tamir Rice shooting \u201cThe election of President Biden, your appointment, and your commitment to the rule of law, racial justice, and police reform give Tamir\u2019s family hope that the chance for accountability is not lost forever,\u201d the family\u2019s attorneys wrote in the letter shared with CNN. Rice was shot and killed outside a recreation center by then-Cleveland police officer Timothy Loehmann, who authorities said mistook a black, toy airsoft pistol for a real firearm.\u00a0The death of the 12-year-old by a White police officer helped to fuel the Black Lives Matter movement. Loehmann was fired in May 2017, not for the shooting, but because investigators found he wasn\u2019t truthful about his employment history when he applied for the job, officials said. \u201cTamir would have been 19 years old in June,\u201d Samaria Rice, Tamir\u2019s mother, said in a statement. \u201cI\u2019m still in so much pain because no one has been held accountable for the criminal act that took his life. I\u2019m asking DOJ to reopen the investigation into my son\u2019s case; we need an indictment and conviction for Tamir\u2019s death. I\u2019m building his legacy. The Tamir Rice Foundation is very invested in the community and dedicated to creating change.\u201d In response to a request, Justice Department\u2019s spokesman Anthony Coley told CNN \u201cwe extend our deepest condolences to the Rice family.

            "article_content": "The culture of Arab Americans will be honored this month, with the designation by the State Department of April as Arab American Heritage Month, reflecting the group\u2019s contributions to the US \u201care as old as America itself,\u201d a spokesman said. \u201cThe United States is home to more than 3.5 million Arab Americans representing a diverse array of cultures and traditions. Like their fellow citizens, Americans of Arab heritage are very much a part of the fabric of this nation,\u201d Ned Price, a spokesman, said in a video statement on April 1. \u201cAnd Arab Americans have contributed in every field and profession, many of them, in fact, serve here at the State Department and throughout the interagency.\u201d Advocacy groups say this is the first time the State Department has designated a particular month for Arab American Heritage Month. States that have recognized April as Arab American History Month in 2021 and years past include Arkansas, Hawaii, Michigan, New York, North Carolina and Virginia. Arab Americans trace their origins to 22 Arabic-speaking countries in the Middle East and North Africa. Arabs began immigrating to the US in the late 1800s fleeing war, persecution and economic hardships, according to the Migration Policy Institute. California, New York, Michigan and Illinois have the largest populations of Arab American residents in the country, based on data from the 2015-2019 ACS Ancestry survey. While the State Department made this announcement, Arab American History Month is not officially recognized by the entire US government. A bill sponsored by Rep. Rashida Tlaib, a Michigan Democrat, was introduced to Congress in 2019 and is still pending. Advocacy groups such as the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination Committee (ADC) and the Arab American Institute (AAI) have been advocating to get April designated as a month to celebrate Arab Americans for two decades. \u201cThis is a breath of fresh air,\u201d said Samer Khalaf, president of the ADC, about the State Department\u2019s move. \u201cIt will give the community a sense of pride and it\u2019s a chance to show what the community is all about, to educate people and dispel stereotypes.\u201d Maya Berry, executive director of the AAI, sees the recognition as a high-level opportunity to celebrate Arab American life in a visible way. \u201cThe formality of it coming from an agency at this level is fantastic,\u201d she said. \u201cThis month is about sharing our story with our fellow Americans.\u201d While the State Department has dedicated the month of April to AAHM, Arab Americans still don\u2019t have a racial or ethnic identifier on forms like the Census, forcing members of the community to tick \u201cWhite\u201d or \u201cother.\u201d The ADC and AAI have been pushing for a Middle East and North Africa (MENA) categorization, which is a geographic designation that includes ethnic and racial options, to be adopted by the US government for decades. The Biden-Harris administration drafted a \u201cplan for partnership\u201d with the Arab American community prior to the 2020 election, pledging to \u201csupport the creation of a new Middle East North Africa (MENA) category.\u201d CNN has contacted the Office of Management and Budget, which sets the standards on racial and ethnic identifiers nationally, for comment. The OMB is the agency that will determine if the identifier is added to Census forms and other documents.",

About 74% of experts agree we need \u201cimmediate and drastic\u201d effort, or risk facing trillions in economic damage and growth. Here\u2019s what you need to know to Get Up to Speed and On with Your Day. (You can also get \u201c5 Things You Need to Know Today\u201d delivered to your inbox daily. Sign up here.) Global leaders have called for an international \u201cpandemic treaty\u201d to help ensure the world is prepared for future crises. The leaders of France, the UK and Germany, and members of the World Health Organization are among those leading the call for increased vaccine equity and international cooperation. Countries and trade blocs have clashed over vaccine supplies, especially in Europe where the coronavirus variant first found in the UK is wreaking havoc on the region\u2019s recovery plans. Experts are worried that if Americans don\u2019t stick to safety measures, the variant could do similar damage in the US. Dangerous coronavirus variants are already leading to more hospitalizations and lockdowns in Canada. Republicans in key electoral states like Arizona, Texas, Michigan and Florida are moving forward with restrictive voting bills despite national outcry against similar laws just passed in Georgia. In Arizona, pending bills would repeal the state\u2019s permanent early voting list and require identification for absentee ballots. In Texas, lawmakers want to ban drive-through voting and bar election officials from sending unsolicited absentee ballot applications. Michigan is considering a slate of nearly 40 changes to the state\u2019s voting laws. Voting rights advocates say there are so many measures cropping up in Republican-led states, they may be powerless to stop them all. Kentucky, however, is bucking the trend and just passed a bipartisan bill expanding absentee and early voting. A series of bystanders testified yesterday in the trial of former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, who is charged with third-degree murder in the death of George Floyd last May. Darnella Frazier, the teen who recorded and shared video of Floyd\u2019s last moments \u2013 video that has been instrumental in understanding the incident and sparked worldwide uproar \u2013 took the stand, as did an off-duty Minneapolis firefighter who said she told officers to check Floyd\u2019s pulse as he lay on the ground. To many, Chauvin\u2019s trial represents not only a judgment of the former officer\u2019s actions, but a judgment on how America responds to painful issues of racial justice. However, the judge in the trial has made it clear to jurors they need to separate their own feelings about race and Chauvin from the evidence provided in the courtroom. President Joe Biden will unveil his ambitious infrastructure package in Pittsburgh today, kicking off what\u2019s likely to be months of conversation and controversy among Democrats. The plan will require trillions in spending and will likely receive pushback from major businesses that will balk at things like proposed increases in corporate taxes and the ending of federal subsidies for fossil fuel firms. Right now, the biggest question is how all of it \u2013 a total of $3 trillion to $4 trillion \u2013 will get paid for. The American Society of Civil Engineers says such high sums are sorely needed to fix the country\u2019s crumbling roads, bridges, public transit systems and dams. Their estimate? About $2.6 trillion over 10 years. Myanmar\u2019s military has been conducting airstrikes on an ethnic rebel-controlled area for days now as the junta steps up aggression in the region.

            "article_content": "The children of three late civil rights movement leaders released a joint letter late Monday night to corporate leaders and lawmakers in response to the new voting law in Georgia. Bernice A. King, the daughter of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.; Al Vivian, the son of the Rev. Cordy Tindell \u201cC.T.\u201d Vivian; and John-Miles Lewis, the son of US Rep. John Lewis, said corporate leaders failed to live up to \u201ctheir racial equity commitments\u201d and disrespected their fathers\u2019 tireless work. \u201cRather than sowing seeds to provide democracy the greatest chance to grow today and prevail tomorrow, legislators are attempting to transport us back to the shameful period of American history when mass voter suppression for communities of color was the law of the land,\u201d they wrote in the letter. The three of them join numerous groups urging corporations based in the state to take a stance against the new law, which some consider one of the nation\u2019s most restrictive voting laws. A civil rights hero's posthumous memoir a guidebook for today's activists The law, signed by Republican Gov. Brian Kemp last week, imposes new voter identification requirements for absentee ballots, empowers state officials to take over local elections boards, limits the use of ballot drop boxes and makes it a crime to approach voters in line to give them food and water. Voting rights groups have said the law would target Black residents and other voters of color in the state. \u201cThe new voter suppression laws are a perversion of truth. Our democracy will be destroyed if we use blunt instruments to appease falsehoods,\u201d they wrote. The three children compared the response of Atlanta\u2019s \u201ccivic and business community\u201d following the passing of Vivian and Lewis last year to the groups\u2019 response to the Georgia voting law. They \u201cbecame vocal champions of equity, diversity, and inclusion,\u201d the letter says. \u201cYet, when the first test came challenging our corporations to move from words to action, to stand on behalf of disenfranchised voters, there was shocking silence,\u201d the letter added. \u201cHistorically, companies\u2019 growth and prosperity in Georgia required integration of democracy and free enterprise. The lack of action is not only ethically wrong and morally reprehensible, it hurts the corporate bottom line. Racism is bad for business.\u201d Martin Luther King III: This is what my father would have done Civil rights and voting rights groups have filed at least three lawsuits in federal court challenging the voting law.

The lawsuit alleges the new law makes it harder for Georgians to vote, \u201cparticularly voters of color, new citizens, and religious communities,\u201d the groups said in a statement announcing the lawsuit. Voters of color were able to cast their ballots after they learned of secure ballot drop boxes, took advantage of early voting and received voter education materials in their native language due to the groups\u2019 work, the lawsuit states. Civil rights groups file third federal lawsuit challenging new Georgia voting law Another lawsuit was filed earlier this week by the Georgia NAACP, Georgia Coalition for the People\u2019s Agenda, League of Women Voters of Georgia, GALEO Latino Community Development Fund, Common Cause and the Lower Muskogee Creek Tribe. That lawsuit claims \u201cSB 202 is the culmination of a concerted effort to suppress the participation of Black voters and other voters of color by the Republican State Senate, State House, and Governor.\u201d That lawsuit alleges Republican officials included specific changes that target voters of color after the record turnout and Democratic victories in the November 2020 presidential election and two Senate runoffs in January 2021. The Georgia law is part of a larger effort by GOP legislators across the country \u2013 including in the battleground states of Michigan and Arizona \u2013 to roll back voting access in the wake of the 2020 election. Across the country, according to a February analysis by the liberal leaning Brennan Center for Justice, at least 253 bills have been introduced this year in 43 state legislatures with provisions that would restrict voting access \u2013 more than six times the number of bills for the same time last year.

            "article_content": "Georgia has a long history of attracting national sports events, but a controversial new voting law might have severe repercussions for that tradition. A leading Black civil rights group is calling on the PGA Tour to pull out of the upcoming Masters Tournament in Augusta after Republican Gov. Brian Kemp last week signed into law one of the nation\u2019s most restrictive voting rights. \u201cThe PGA Tour and Masters Tournament have both made commitments to help diversify golf and address racial inequities in this country \u2013 and we expect them to not only speak out against Georgia\u2019s new racist voter suppression law \u2013 but to also take action,\u201d the National Black Justice Coalition said in a statement. The new law imposes new voter identification requirements for absentee ballots, empowers state officials to take over local elections boards, limits the use of ballot drop boxes and makes it a crime to approach voters in line to give them food and water. Voting rights groups have said the law would target the Black residents and other voters of color in the state. Groups file second lawsuit challenging new Georgia voting law The National Black Justice Coalition said professional golfers should refuse to play in Georgia until the law is repealed. CNN has reached out to Augusta National and PGA Tour for comment. Major League Baseball may also be faced with a decision. This year\u2019s MLB All-Star Game is scheduled to take place this summer at Truist Park \u2013  home of the Atlanta Braves. The executive director of the MLB Players Association says the union is open to discussing pulling the MLB All-Star game out of Georgia, according to a story published by Boston Globe on Friday. Tony Clark told the Globe that \u201cplayers are very much aware\u201d of the law, but \u201cas it relates to the All-Star Game, we have not had a conversation with the league on that issue.\u201d CNN has reached out to MLB and the MLB Players Association for comment. Previously, another sporting league changed its plans in response to another state\u2019s legislation. The NBA moved its 2017 All-Star game out of Charlotte, North Carolina, after a controversial transgender bathroom law was passed. The law was later repealed, and Charlotte hosted the All-Star Game in 2019. The Women\u2019s National Basketball Players Association, many members of which have been champions for social justice and racial equality, has also condemned the new law in Georgia. \u201cSB 202 is a direct attack on the historic turnout and participation by voters during the November and January elections \u2013 elections where Georgians voted to elect the first Black and Jewish senators from Georgia,\u201d the WNBPA said in a statement. The statement adds that the law comes after an election where minority voters made their voices heard in record numbers. \u201cThis is a racist backlash designed to silence the people\u2019s voices, mirroring the over 200 bills in state legislatures across the country designed to target voters and suppress democracy,\u201d the statement said.

            "article_content": "Georgia\u2019s controversial sweeping elections bill has been signed into law. And historians and critics are likening the measures to the start of a new Jim Crow era, saying it\u2019s a direct attack on the right to vote for Black Georgians in future elections. According to Adrienne Jones, a political science professor at Morehouse College in Atlanta, firsthand accounts of slavery and Jim Crow America are a reflection of where our democracy could be headed if voting restriction laws keep being passed in state legislatures around the country. \u201cReading slave narratives, you\u2019re experiencing the lives of people who are cut off from participation in their society, who did not have full citizenship. It allows us to view what society will be like from a fully disempowered state,\u201d she told CNN. \u201cThe right to vote was essential in the transition from being a slave to being a citizen. And now these rights are in danger again.\u201d Jones said that it is valuable to revisit these slave narratives in the context of today\u2019s battle over voting rights. \u201cOur understanding of who is worthy of citizenship is affected by our experience with slavery,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd voting is the way that we express citizenship in this country.\u201d Georgia\u2019s new voting restrictions bill, SB202, passed both chambers of the legislature in the span of a few hours before Republican Gov. Brian Kemp signed it Thursday night. The new law imposes new voter identification requirements for absentee ballots, empowers state officials to take over local elections boards, limits the use of ballot drop boxes and makes it a crime to approach voters in line to give them food and water. By changing its election laws, \u201cGeorgia will take another step toward ensuring our elections are secure, accessible, and fair,\u201d Kemp said. Cliff Albright, co-founder of the Black Voters Matter Fund, says that these bills are simply \u201cJim Crow with a suit and tie and maybe a little bit of makeup and cologne on.\u201d This persistent threat to the voting rights of Black Americans is one piece of the country\u2019s enduring racial legacy, historians say. \u201cYou have to go back to the Reconstruction period or post-Reconstruction period to see this type of attack on voting rights,\u201d Albright said. \u201cThey are attacking every phase of voting.\u201d Compiled 71 years after the end of the Civil War, \u201cSlave Narratives: A Folk History of Slavery in the United States,\u201d includes the histories and experiences of more than 2,300 people who were formerly enslaved. A digital copy is available to the public on the Library of Congress website. The narratives were collected between 1936 and 1938 as part of the Federal Writers\u2019 Project (FWP) of the Works Progress Administration, later renamed Work Projects Administration (WPA). Of those narratives, 163 are from Georgians, who recall their early lives on plantations across the state in Athens, Augusta, Columbus, Greensboro, Gwinnett County, Jefferson, Liberty County, Macon, Milledgeville, Washington-Wilkes, and White Plains. Many reflect on the changes, or lack thereof, brought on by emancipation. Struggles that still reverberate through our society today. Professor Leslie Harris agrees. Harris, who teaches African American history at Northwestern University, previously taught at Emory University where she led several public history initiatives on the legacy of slavery. Her father was born in the segregated South just a few years after these slave narratives were collated. She says that the restrictions of today are a disturbing echo of the post-Civil War South. While the passage of the 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments constituted racial reckonings in their own right, the retaliatory Jim Crow laws \u201cwere concerted efforts to stop these changes, just like we\u2019re seeing now with these new voting restriction bills in Georgia.\u201d \u201cIt wasn\u2019t like the laws passed and everything was changed,\u201d Harris added. The fact that former slaves were alive less than a century ago is a stark reminder that the fight for Black freedom and civil rights is not a distant lesson from a history textbook, but still a lived reality for many, Jones said. By reexamining these stories we can appreciate today\u2019s activist efforts as natural continuations of an intergenerational fight for justice. \u201cLife is short. One hundred years is not a very long time,\u201d Jones said. \u201cAfter your great-great-grandfather got emancipated, they lived through Jim Crow for a century and that overlap alone impacts your forward movement.\u201d We tend to conceptualize change in terms of legislation, milestones like the Emancipation Proclamation of 1863, the 15th Amendment of 1870, and the Civil Rights Act of 1964. But, according to Jones: \u201cIt\u2019s not just the law, it\u2019s the culture. \u201cThere needs to be a psychological shift in order for any substantial change to happen,\u201d she said. \u201cBecause you don\u2019t get people to change their ways just by talking at them.\u201d Jones says that it\u2019s no coincidence that these voting restriction laws have been passed following a record turnout from Black voters that secured Georgia its first Black and Jewish senators. According to her, there is always a lag before the mainstream culture catches up with any formal progressive measure, and this lag is often regressive and reactionary. This is historically evident in the passage of grandfather clauses and literacy tests to disenfranchise Black voters after the passage of the Fifteenth Amendment. It is also evident in the resurgence of the Ku Klux Klan during Reconstruction. Former slaves recalled the terror instilled in them by the Klan after emancipation, especially following the assassination of pro-African American politician George W. Ashburn in 1868. That year, the Freedmen\u2019s Bureau reported 336 cases of murder and aggravated assault by Klan members against African Americans. \u201cI sure did keep out of the way of them Ku Kluxers,\u201d recalled Addie Vinson in 1938. She worked as a plow hand in Oconee County. \u201cFolks would see \u2018em comin\u2019 and holler out: The Ku Kluxers is ridin\u2019 tonight. Keep out of their way, or they will kill you.\u2019\u201d Following emancipation, the vast majority of Black Americans were sent into the world with no land or education, and with little legal protections to ease them into life as American citizens. Eugene Wesley Smith was 13 years old when Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee surrendered to Union General Ulysses S. Grant. In the interview with the FWP, he recalled how the Union Army broke the news of his freedom: \u201cAll the Yankees and some of our leading colored men got up there and spoke, and told the negroes: \u2018You are free. Don\u2019t steal! Now work and make a living. Do honest work, make an honest living and support yourself and children. There are no more masters. You are free!\u2019\u201d But what did this freedom mean? Mostly, a lack of food, land, and education that forced many former slaves to continue working for their former masters as sharecroppers. Adeline Willis of Wilkes County and Henry Wright of Buckhead told the FWP interviewers, \u201cwe kept living like we did in slavery.\u201d \u201cIt was two or three years after the war before any of us could save up enough money to start buying land,\u201d Vinson told the FWP in 1938. \u201cAnd then, if we didn\u2019t watch our steps mighty careful, the white folks would find a way to get that land back from us.\u201d Some FWP interviewers described the living conditions of those they interviewed. Several lived in welfare housing in Atlanta, many others in rundown shacks or cabins. Sadie B. Hornsby describes the scene on 156 Willow Street, the home of Alice Green in Athens, as \u201ca tumble down shack set in a small yard, which was enclosed by a sagging poultry wire fence. The gate, off its hinges, was propped across the entrance.\u201d Professor Harris points out that a decade after these interviews were collected, the post-World War II suburb boom led to intense redlining across the United States. These discriminatory housing policies prevented Black Americans from receiving mortgage loans and led to increased disinvestment in majority-Black communities, widening the already-present socioeconomic chasm between Black and White America. \u201cWe still live with those types of suburbs,\u201d she said. \u201cThese actions and legacies don\u2019t disappear overnight. These slave narratives show us that, unless we actively fight for our citizenship, it will not be given to us.\u201d \u201cInequity is intergenerational,\u201d agrees Jones. \u201cIf we don\u2019t understand the slave narratives, we don\u2019t understand why people behave in the ways that they do today, and we don\u2019t recognize how inequitable even the best legislation is at providing the kind of equity that it presumably provides.\u201d Coming to terms with the legacy of slavery and White supremacy ultimately means coming to terms with one of its most prominent vestiges: voting restriction laws. Although the Voting Rights Act of 1965 outlawed discriminatory voting requirements, such as literacy tests, in the decades that followed lawmakers began chipping away at the protections it guaranteed. In 2013, the Supreme Court declared unconstitutional Section 4(b) of the Act, which required districts with a history of racial discrimination to obtain federal approval before implementing changes to their voting laws. With Section 4(b) gone, the Voting Rights Act was effectively declawed. Now, a final push to kill the Voting Rights Act is underway. Even as Brnovich v. Democratic National Committee is being argued in the Supreme Court, lawmakers in more than 40 states, including Georgia, have introduced more than 250 bills that include voting restrictions, according to a tally by the Brennan Center For Justice at New York University. Harris cautions that voters shouldn\u2019t downplay the racial subtext underlying the rhetoric of election security. In fact, she finds a striking parallel between the narrative of the Civil War as a fight over states\u2019 rights and the unfounded claim of voter fraud as an impetus for these new bills. \u201cIf we look back to the Civil War, issues of race led to the literal downfall of this nation,\u201d she said. \u201cBoth the states\u2019 rights narrative and the dog whistle of election fraud completely remove Black people from the story.\u201d Jones says that these new bills are meant to paralyze voting rights activists. \u201cShock is damaging. People say that they can\u2019t believe that this is happening in 2021. Yes, you can. We need to move past shock as quickly as we can and decide how we\u2019re going to move forward and what we\u2019re going to do to combat it. If we waste our energy on shock, we\u2019re losing.\u201d Despite these reactionary efforts, Harris still feels hopeful. \u201cBesides the legacy of slavery and Jim Crow, Georgia has a strong civil rights history that reinforces our understanding of that era,\u201d she said. \u201cTogether, they remind us that horrible things happen but also that great progress is made. What we need to recognize, especially in the context of January\u2019s runoff, is that it\u2019s never one and done. It\u2019s a struggle, and we need to stay vigilant.\u201d CNN\u2019s Fredreka Schouten contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Meimei Xu grew up in Illinois, Florida and Georgia. But that didn\u2019t stop people from asking her, \u201cWhere are you from?\u201d The 19-year-old says growing up Asian American hasn\u2019t been easy. When she was in grade school there were classmates who made hurtful comments. They told her Chinese food was strange and one of them even told her Chinese girls aren\u2019t attractive. But she doesn\u2019t want those experiences defining her. \u201cI would rather define my own existence,\u201d she says. The recent Atlanta-area spa shootings that left eight people dead, including six Asian women, are shining a spotlight on the struggles of Asian American communities across the US. And experts are warning how the rise in anti-Asian violence can leave lasting mental health repercussions. A study by the Center for the Study of Hate & Extremism at California State University, San Bernardino, shows that anti-Asian hate crimes in 16 of America\u2019s largest cities increased 149% in 2020. The first spike occurred in March and April amidst a rise in Covid-19 cases and negative stereotyping of Asians relating to the pandemic. But it\u2019s not just the immediate effect of these hate crimes that people have to worry about. One psychiatrist says anti-Asian racism can have far-reaching mental health repercussions. In an article in the New England Journal of Medicine, Dr. James H. Lee, a first-year psychiatry resident at University of Washington School of Medicine, said that if physicians don\u2019t address the issue with patients who have experienced racism they risk leaving them to deal with mental illness on their own. \u201cI think that one of the consequences of this racism is going to be a lot of anxiety and depression,\u201d Lee said in an interview with UW Medicine. \u201cAnd fear and trauma. I don\u2019t want to miss those. I don\u2019t want our healthcare system to miss those. And I think that the way we\u2019re currently operating we could. We could let a lot of patients fall (through) the cracks.\u201d A Pew Research study published in July 2020 found that 58% of Asian-Americans felt anti-Asian racism had worsened since the beginning of the pandemic. And 26% feared that someone might threaten or physically attack them. Concerns over mental health are especially important when dealing with children and young adults. CNN spoke to high school and college students about the prejudice they\u2019ve faced growing up Asian American in the US. Javon Huynh, 20, says he and his siblings were the only Black Vietnamese Americans growing up in his Georgia hometown. He especially remembers one incident when he was six years old. \u201cI was in the office waiting for my mom to come get me. It was really late, so the lady at the front office and my teacher tried calling her and one of them had a hard time pronouncing her last name. So they started laughing and making jokes about it. And I just remember in my head being mad and upset,\u201d Huynh says. \u201cThey may have thought there is no harm in a little joke and it wasn\u2019t that serious, but it\u2019s my name, my heritage. My name has meaning and a story behind it,\u201d he adds. Huynh says his family celebrates both Asian and American culture. They celebrate Lunar New Year but also enjoy celebrating Thanksgiving. But they try to add some Vietnamese flavor to their holiday meals by having fried rice and egg rolls alongside turkey for Thanksgiving and Easter. Language and cultural differences make it harder for some Asian families when they emigrate. And Huynh feels his mother and aunt had a harder experience when they were growing up. \u201cThey had to learn English and help translate to Vietnamese for my grandparents. It must have been so difficult for them having to learn things like how to buy a house or a car or find a job because it wasn\u2019t easy back in the 80\u2019s trying to get or apply for those things,\u201d he says. Huynh feels the recent spate of anti-Asian hate crimes has been very unnerving. He is very close to his grandparents and says these attacks worry him. \u201cWhen I see older Asians getting attacked, I can\u2019t help thinking \u2018What if they were my grandparents?\u2019\u201d he says. He adds that many Asians don\u2019t speak up about these problems not because they don\u2019t care, but because they are scared and want to avoid conflict. Huynh says negative incidents definitely made it harder for him to fit in as he grew up, especially when people would make him feel that being different was a bad thing. \u201cIt also made me more closed off instead of embracing who I am,\u201d he says. But once he got to travel outside his small town he finally realized he was not alone. Huynh says he really found his niche when he joined band in sixth grade. Band became his \u201chappy place\u201d and that\u2019s where he met lifelong friends. He credits his high school band director with really helping him and becoming like \u201ca father figure I never had.\u201d That\u2019s why Huynh says he wants to become a teacher. \u201cI enjoy working with kids and want to help be a voice for them, especially kids with different cultural backgrounds. I want to have an impact on their lives,\u201d Huynh adds. Meimei Xu says the racial prejudice was most difficult to face when she was in elementary school. \u201cSome of my classmates would pull back their eyes into slits and imitate the language,\u201d Xu says. \u201cIn middle school, I often heard the phrase, \u2018Of course she\u2019s smart, she\u2019s Asian,\u2019\u201d Xu says, recalling that sometimes she felt ashamed of playing the violin and doing well in certain subjects because they seemed stereotypically Chinese. But as she grew older, Xu says, the discrimination has been more subtle. Xu says her family also celebrates both Asian and American culture: Eating a big potluck meal with other Chinese families during Lunar New Year and having Turkey during Thanksgiving. But her parents have helped her stay connected to her roots as well. \u201cI visit my relatives in China every two or three years. We usually stay for a few weeks, spending a few days in different cities since all our relatives live in different places,\u201d Xu says. Xu says as she grew older she fostered strong connections in writing groups. \u201cI felt most welcome in environments that did not put a strong emphasis on racial divides,\u201d she says. She hopes to become a journalist and perhaps also go to law school and work in government one day. \u201cThe negative incidents of racial discrimination in my childhood are no longer something that I see as an integral or even influential part of my growing up. I do not want to give power to other people\u2019s negative perceptions of me. I see my growing up as a process of me finding my own strength, on my own terms and in my own time,\u201d she adds. Tiffany Pham, 17, says sometimes when Asian Americans face discrimination, they\u2019ve been \u201cconditioned to just sit passively and endure it, rather than sticking up for ourselves or fighting back.\u201d \u201cPart of it lies in the linguistic barrier, part of it lies in fear of being ostracized even further,\u201d says Pham, who grew up in Georgia. She says she lived in a community that was very diverse with many immigrant families, including Hispanic and Black families. And they all celebrated each other\u2019s cultures. \u201cWe went to a Buddhist temple every Sunday. It was a place where I could bond with kids who looked like me, and I could relate to,\u201d she says. But during break at Sunday school, she would speak English \u201cand talk about American things.\u201d Pham says her most humiliating experience was probably during a summer camp trip. \u201cA boy was slanting his eyes and making racist jokes in a horrible, mocking Chinese accent. A couple of the kids sitting with him began to laugh too. I remember that I wanted to crawl into a hole at that time. I begged my friend to let me borrow her earbuds so I didn\u2019t have to listen to the taunting. No one really stood up or said anything back to him,\u201d she says. The experience was like a wake-up call. \u201cI realized that this would be an experience that I\u2019d come to encounter more often as I grew up,\u201d Pham adds. She says a lot of Asian American children are conditioned to think that humiliating jokes and comments are something that happens and \u201cnot worth discussing.\u201d But things got better for her in middle school. When she ran for student council one classmate made a derogatory comment. \u201cBut I ended up winning the election,\u201d she says. \u201cIn a way, it sort of solidified my acceptance into American culture. My classmates didn\u2019t perceive me in a discriminatory or prejudiced way because I was Asian.\u201d",

            "article_content": "White and Black Americans\u2019 perceptions of race relations and the circumstances around George Floyd\u2019s death remain split, a new poll has found. Ahead of the trial of Derek Chauvin, a former Minneapolis Police officer charged with the murder of George Floyd, a USA Today/Ipsos poll explored America\u2019s views on race, policing and Floyd\u2019s killing. The poll was conducted March 1 and 2 and based on a nationally representative sample of 1,165  people ages 18 and older. The poll findings come just days before the one-year anniversary of Breonna Taylor\u2019s death in Louisville, Kentucky. Jury selection set to begin in Derek Chauvin's trial in the death of George Floyd. Here's what to expect When asked about Floyd\u2019s death, 64% of Black people described it as a murder, according to the poll. Among White respondents, 28% described it as murder and 33% said \u201cit was negligence on part of the officer.\u201d Clifford Young, president of public affairs in the United States for Ipsos, said the contrast in responses extends to nearly every question in the survey. \u201cBlack Americans, for instance, and minorities in general are still super focused on this issue. It hasn\u2019t gone away. It can\u2019t go away because they live with it every day,\u201d Young said. USA Today/Ipsos conducted a similar poll in June as protests condemning police brutality took place across the United States. Last year, 60% of all respondents described Floyd\u2019s death as murder. That number dropped to 36% in the latest poll. Floyd, a 46-year-old Black man, died on May 25, 2020, after Chauvin placed his knee on Floyd\u2019s neck for nearly eight minutes while Floyd pleaded, \u201cI can\u2019t breathe.\u201d His death sparked a worldwide movement and America became the epicenter of a racial reckoning. In the months that followed, people protested in the streets and headed to the polls with Black, Latino and Native Americans voters flipping some states blue during the presidential election. More recently, critics saw White privilege in the police response to the US Capitol insurrectionists compared to the response to protests over Floyd\u2019s death. After months of racial reckoning, views over whether race relations have changed are also divided. Overall, more Americans (47%) believe race relations have neither improved nor worsened in the past year, the poll shows. But 40% said they feel race relations actually worsened and only 13% said they had improved. Among Black Americans, 54% say race relations have worsened in the past year, while 10% believe they have improved. But more White Americans (51%) feel they have neither improved nor worsened and 35% said they have worsened, according to the poll. Young said researchers were surprised by the results of the poll, which, he says, shows that racial justice is no longer \u201cfront and center\u201d in many people\u2019s minds, especially for those who are not impacted daily. \u201cIt\u2019s disheartening,\u201d Young said. \u201cWhat was very clear for us is that when it comes to racial justice issues, it\u2019s sort of \u2018out of sight, out of mind\u2019 for most Americans,\u201d he added. \u201cIn other words, either there\u2019s an acute problem like the George Floyd killing that brings to the forefront the issue and everyone pays attention, but if not, it\u2019s sort of recede in the memory and people focus on other things.\u201d CNN\u2019s Priya Krishnakumar contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Wanda Cooper-Jones never imagined having to live life without her son Ahmaud Arbery. But in the year since he was killed, that is her reality. She now spends her days thinking about him, visiting his gravestone, reflecting on her \u201cbaby boy,\u201d and recounting the moment she received the call that the 25-year-old was dead. Cooper-Jones said it gets frustrating waiting for justice. The men charged in Arbery\u2019s murder still have no trial date. However, she remains confident they will be convicted. \u201cIt gives me a little push that I have to remain strong and keep my mind in good sanity,\u201d Cooper-Jones said. \u201cI want to be around when justice is served.\u201d Today marks one year since Arbery died after being chased and shot by Gregory and Travis McMichael as he jogged through a coastal Georgia neighborhood. The McMichaels are facing murder charges and remain in jail without bond. William \u201cRoddie\u201d Bryan, who recorded cell phone video of Arbery\u2019s death, was also charged and is being held without bond. Arbery\u2019s death, which didn\u2019t gain national attention until two months after it happened, sparked outrage across the nation. It became yet another example of the many perils visited on Black people engaged in ordinary activities, particularly after the disturbing video of the shooting emerged. Cooper-Jones filed a federal civil rights lawsuit Tuesday alleging a broad conspiracy by law enforcement and the three suspects in a blatant cover up to prevent their arrest. In a court filing obtained by CNN, Cooper-Jones alleges that \u201cfor nearly three months, Glynn County Police Officers, the chief of police, and two prosecutors conspired to hide the circumstances surrounding Ahmaud\u2019s death and to protect the men that murdered him. And none of this would\u2019ve been discovered but for video footage leaked to the media, which showed the horrific and brutal murder of Ahmaud.\u201d Ahmaud Arbery was killed doing what he loved, and a south Georgia community demands justice Arbery\u2019s death renewed efforts to dismantle systems, hold public officials accountable and repeal policies that have historically allowed vigilante violence against unarmed Black people. Activists say while their pursuit for justice in Arbery\u2019s case continues, there has been notable progress. Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp recently announced plans to repeal the Civil War-era citizen\u2019s arrest law; the southern Georgia prosecutor who failed to make an arrest after Arbery\u2019s death was voted out of office in November; an Atlanta area district attorney is now prosecuting the case; and Kemp signed a hate crime bill last year spurred by outrage over Arbery\u2019s death. James Woodall, president of the Georgia NAACP, said these actions are critical to addressing what he says is the racist violence behind Arbery\u2019s death. \u201cThis one-year anniversary is very bittersweet because what was able to be done in the aftermath was we pushed the envelope on policy that continued to allow these acts of vigilante and racial and extrajudicial violence,\u201d Woodall said. \u201cWe were able to identify exactly what we wanted.\u201d It's what I can't see in the Ahmaud Arbery shooting video that also terrifies me Woodall said the Georgia NAACP advocated for the state to repeal the citizen\u2019s arrest law after Waycross District Attorney George Barnhill \u2013 the second prosecutor to oversee the probe last year \u2013 cited the statute to justify his decision not to charge the McMichaels with Arbery\u2019s death. The state law allows private citizens to arrest someone if they have immediate knowledge or reasonable suspicion that the person has committed a crime. The McMichaels told police they believed Arbery was a suspect in recent burglaries in the neighborhood and followed him. Kemp has introduced a plan to replace the law with a bill that removes legal loopholes that could be used to justify vigilante violence.  The new law makes specific allowances for business owners or employees who can detain someone committing a theft in their establishment, private security officers, and police officers who can make arrests outside of their jurisdictions in certain instances. \u201cAhmaud was a victim of a vigilante style of violence that has no place in Georgia,\u201d Kemp said last week. \u201cSome tried to justify the actions of his killers by claiming they had the protection of an antiquated law that is ripe for abuse.\u201d Kemp also signed a hate crime bill last June after Georgia drew criticism for being one of four states that didn\u2019t have a law against hate crimes. The law allows judges imposing sentences to increase punishment against those who target victims based on perceived race, color, religion, national origin, sex, sexual orientation, gender, mental disability or physical disability. Cooper-Jones and civil rights activists say they won\u2019t get justice in Arbery\u2019s death until the McMichaels and Bryan are found guilty and sentenced to life in prison. But there is currently no trial date because of Covid-19 restrictions in Georgia, said Cobb County District Attorney Flynn D. Broady Jr. who is prosecuting the case. The state turned the case over to Cobb County last May after three southern Georgia prosecutors failed to make arrests in the killing of Arbery. Among them was former Brunswick District Attorney Jackie Johnson, who had jurisdiction over the case but recused herself because Gregory McMichael was a retired investigator from her office. Johnson lost her bid for re-election in November. Broady, who unseated the county\u2019s former district attorney Joyette M. Holmes in November, said he expects the trial to begin some time this year and that the McMichaels and Bryan will be tried together. \u201cJustice will come,\u201d Broady told CNN. \u201cAnd I believe as soon as Covid is under control, we will see justice in this case.\u201d Bryan\u2019s attorney Kevin Gough said in a statement that his client is \u201cpresumed innocent\u201d and that his office is pursuing another bond hearing for Bryan after being denied bond seven months ago. The attorneys said they also have a pending motion to dismiss the charges against Bryan. \u201cOur condolences go out to the family of Ahmaud Arbery on the anniversary of his tragic death,\u201d the statement said. \u201cIt is certainly a day that Mr. Bryan will never forget.\u201d The law firm Peters, Rubin, Sheffield, & Hodges P.A., which is representing Travis McMichael, released a statement saying \u201cthe sadness and tragedy surrounding Mr. Arbery\u2019s death will never be forgotten.\u201d \u201cWe join the community in giving our condolences and prayers for Mr. Arbery\u2019s family and friends for their loss,\u201d the statement said. Laura D. Hogue, an attorney for Gregory McMichael, declined to comment on the case saying \u201cthe commemoration of this date belongs to the Arbery family.\u201d Social justice advocates say despite the policy and leadership changes in Georgia, Arbery\u2019s death reflects a structural and societal issue with racist violence in the US. Rashad Robinson, president of Color of Change, said the justice system is unequal and has historically allowed White people to get away with killing Black people. The protests and community engagement that followed Arbery\u2019s death brought attention to this inequity and held law enforcement officials accountable for their lack of action, he said. Now, Robinson said the nation needs more policies that ensure accountability for every case involving racist violence and more investment in Black communities. \u201cWhen the killer is White and the victim is Black in communities around the country, justice isn\u2019t served,\u201d Robinson said. \u201cThere is nothing new about what happened to Ahmaud Arbery.\u201d Cooper-Jones said she knows her son was targeted because he was a Black man. However, she feels encouraged by the outpouring of support from people from all over and the policy changes that have resulted from Arbery\u2019s death. She plans to honor him at a candlelight vigil on Tuesday evening at New Springfield Baptist Church in Waynesboro, GA. \u201cI was a mother, Ahmaud was my baby boy,\u201d Cooper-Jones said. \u201cHe just wasn\u2019t a jogger, he was my son.\u201d CNN\u2019s Amir Vera contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "The Rev. Jemar Tisby describes himself as a \u201ctheological mutt.\u201d He was baptized in a Southern Baptist church, joined a White nondenominational congregation and spent much of his time attending Catholic schools. But once he attended a small Black Baptist church in the Mississippi Delta, he found a home. Located in a former warehouse, the church had concrete floors, metal folding chairs for pews and an elderly congregation of only about 12 people. What they lacked in size, though, they made up for in spiritual fervor. When members of the congregation began to \u201cfeel the spirit,\u201d they cried, moaned and swayed while singing spirituals like \u201cWade in the Water.\u201d \u201cIt was if you were hearing the echoes of the ancestors,\u201d says Tisby, author of \u201cHow To Fight Racism: Courageous Christianity and the Journey Toward Racial Justice.\u201d \u201cIt was almost like you were transported back in time. There was a dignity and ancestral strength that they tapped into.\u201d The Black church rituals that Tisby celebrates are in the national spotlight this week. For over 400 years, the Black church has been the central institution in the African American community, but many of its customs remain a mystery to outsiders. New research and a new documentary film could help change that. The Pew Research Center on Tuesday is publishing a major study, \u201cFaith Among Black Americans,\u201d that takes a sweeping look at African Americans\u2019 religious beliefs and practices. On Tuesday night PBS will premiere \u201cThe Black Church: This is Our Story, This is Our Song,\u201d a two-part documentary series produced and hosted by scholar Henry Louis Gates Jr. Featuring interviews from such luminaries as Oprah Winfrey, singer John Legend and social critic Cornel West, the series examines \u201cthe world within a world\u201d of the Black church\u2019s distinctive style of preaching, gospel music and blending of African faith traditions with Christianity. \u201cThe Black church gave people a sense of value, belonging and worthiness,\u201d Winfrey says in the special. \u201cI don\u2019t know how we could have survived as a people without it.\u201d The Pew study and the PBS special arrive as the Black church is helping transform American politics. Black churchgoers played a critical role in President Biden\u2019s victory and helped Democrats win control of the US Senate with the election of Raphael Warnock, a Black pastor who preaches in the same Atlanta pulpit that the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. once occupied. After four years of White evangelicals grabbing headlines, the Black church is getting its due. The phrase \u201cthe Black Church\u201d has long been used by Black scholars and clergy as an umbrella term for all historically Black Protestant denominations as well as nondenominational churches with predominantly Black congregations, Pew says. The new study, Pew\u2019s most comprehensive look at the religious practices of Black Americans, is based on interviews with at least 8,660 Black adults. For comparative purposes, researchers also posed some of the same questions to 4,574 Americans of other races. It found that Black people are more religious than other groups in the US. While 90% of Americans overall in believe in God or a higher power, 97% of Black adults believe in the same, Pew says. And while 54% of Americans surveyed believe \u201cevil spirits can harm,\u201d 73% of Black adults say the same. Black Americans are also more likely to say religion is \u201cvery important\u201d in their lives, and to believe prayers to ancestors have protective power, the survey found. Most Black adults regularly engage in personal prayer, with 63% saying they pray at least once a day. The Black church is also known for its unique culture. The study found that Black Protestants are far more likely than Black adults of other faiths to go to a church that features highly expressive worship: dancing in the aisles, speaking in tongues and shouts of \u201camen!\u201d The study also explores an integral facet of the Black church: Its stance on social justice. As Pew discovered, that activism remains essential to many African Americans. At least 44% of Protestant Black churchgoers said they heard a sermon, lecture or discussion on race relations or racial inequality in the last year while 29% of all adults heard a sermon on the same topics during the same time period. \u201cMost Black Christians say that opposing racism is essential to being a Christian,\u201d says Besheer Mohamed, who co-authored the report along with Kiana Cox, Jeff Diamant and Claire Gecewicz. The PBS special tells the story behind those numbers, describing the Black church as an \u201cengine for social justice.\u201d Many of the country\u2019s best-known civil rights leaders \u2013 King, Frederick Douglass, the activist Fannie Lou Hamer \u2013 were motivated primarily by their Christian faith and the Black church\u2019s tradition of speaking truth to power. \u201cThis is the story and song our ancestors bequeathed to us,\u201d says Gates, host of the PBS special. \u201cNo social institution in the Black community is more central and important than the Black church.\u201d The Black church\u2019s emphasis on social justice may seem baffling to outsiders who think churches shouldn\u2019t get involved in politics. But the Black church was forged during the crucible of slavery. Enslaved Africans drew hope from stories like Moses leading the children of Israel out of bondage. For them, Christianity was about liberation from injustice, not just personal sin. For decades the Black church was the only independent institution in the Black community that had the sufficient numbers and resources to push for social change, says Tisby, the pastor and author. Today groups like Black Lives Matter aren\u2019t as dependent on the Black church and can mobilize people on social media, he says. That may explain some trends in the Pew survey. Despite the Black church\u2019s key place in Black life, almost half (47%) of African Americans believe that predominately Black churches are less influential today than they were 50 years ago. Only 30% think they are more influential. The study also found that that younger Black adults are less religious and less involved in Black churches than older generations. About half of Black adults born after 1996 attend a Black church, compared to two-thirds of Black Baby Boomers. Still, the Black church still wields tremendous power and resources. The church\u2019s ability to influence the 2020 election is evidence of that, Tisby says. \u201cThe Black church isn\u2019t the only outlet for organizing and protest, but it remains the central outlet,\u201d he says. Tisby says he is not worried about the long-term mission of the Black church. All he has to do is look at the headlines. He cites how many White evangelical churches threw their support behind former President Trump. \u201cI don\u2019t worry too much about the Black church,\u201d he says. \u201cAs long as there is racism within the White church, there will always be a Black church.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Nikki Buskirk was watching vice presidential nominee Kamala Harris and her husband Doug Emhoff wave to supporters at an Election Night celebration in November when the future second gentleman did something that made Buskirk glow with admiration. The couple had just taken the stage in downtown Wilmington, Delaware, when red, white, and blue fireworks suddenly exploded in the evening sky. Buskirk says she watched as Emhoff instinctively stepped toward Harris to protect her. That gesture touched Buskirk because her marriage had set off some fireworks of its own. She\u2019s a proud Black woman and Black Lives Matter activist who had violated an unwritten rule in the Black community \u2013 thou shalt not date or marry White men. The Ohio woman had been told all her life she was supposed to marry a strong Black man and build a strong Black family. But then she met Tyler Buskirk, a self-assured White man who shared her love of \u201cThe Phantom of the Opera\u201d and Dungeons & Dragons. Their marriage shocked some members of both of their families, and Buskirk says she\u2019s gotten plenty of icy, \u201chow-could-you?\u201d stares from Black women and men in public. Seeing Emhoff rush to protect Harris, though, reminded her not of what she\u2019s endured but what she\u2019s gained \u2013 a man who is ready to defend her, no matter what comes their way. \u201cHe\u2019s my rock to come home to after fighting the world, my shield when it becomes too much, and my crusader when I can\u2019t get through,\u201d says Buskirk, 37. The pair live in Columbus, Ohio, where she works in a ministry at a local United Methodist Church. \u201cWhen I see Vice President Harris and her husband, I see us.\u201d Will more Black women begin to see the same potential for romantic love with White men? Harris\u2019 next four years in the White House could help provide an answer. Harris is the first female, Black and South Asian vice president of the United States, but she could also become another type of pioneer. She could inspire some Black women to reexamine a racial taboo that has shaped many of their private lives. Harris has so far shared few private details about her marriage to Emhoff, a lawyer. They were set up on a blind date in 2013, when Harris was California\u2019s attorney general, and married a year later. Harris did briefly respond to criticism of her marriage to a White man in a 2019 radio interview. \u201cLook, I love my husband, and he happened to be the one that I chose to marry, because I love him \u2013 and that was that moment in time, and that\u2019s it,\u201d Harris said. \u201cAnd he loves me.\u201d As President Barack Obama\u2019s mere presence in the White House provoked discussions on biracial identity and Black marriage, Harris\u2019 marriage could lead more Black women to talk openly about this taboo, one scholar says. \u201cI think there is potential, but it depends on how public or private she is about her marriage,\u201d says Dianne M. Stewart, author of \u201cBlack Women, Black Love: America\u2019s War on African American Marriage.\u201d \u201cIf she decides to talk about this aspect of her life and enters conversations about it or allows the broader public to have information about her own journey, it could influence Black women\u2019s thinking,\u201d says Stewart, an associate professor of religion and African American studies at Emory University in Atlanta. She could even change long-held views in the Black community. One White House predecessor might even serve as a role model. Obama helped shift support for same-sex marriage among African Americans when he became the first President to say same-sex couples should be allowed to get married. Many Black women have traditionally shunned White men for a variety of reasons.  Some say they can\u2019t be with a White man because he wouldn\u2019t understand what it\u2019s like to experience racism. Others say they owe it to their race to marry Black men and build healthy Black families. Yet other Black women cite more personal reasons for staying away from White men. They say being with a White man evokes memories of how White plantation owners and others sexually abused Black women during slavery and colonization. They\u2019re afraid of being treated as hypersexualized caricatures.  (Some Asian women are wary of being with White men for some of the same reasons as Black women.) \u201cI haven\u2019t completely reached the point where I can confidently order an Oreo ice cream swirl without some White guy telling me it \u2018looks like us,\u2019 but regardless of the number of \u2018I love the color of your skin\u2019 and \u2018cream to your coffee\u2019 messages that flood my DMs, determining whether a man is fetishizing me or not is not up to the discretion of White people,\u201d Kendall Tiarra wrote  in a recent essay titled, \u201cAm I a Fetish or Just the Prettiest Girl in the Room?\u201d   Some Black women reduce their reluctance to dating White men to one thought \u2013 it\u2019s too much work. For example, they don\u2019t want to expend energy teaching White men about racism or dealing with derogatory comments from friends, family and others. Shamontiel L. Vaughn, a writer and editor, says she\u2019s open to dating White men, but 90% of the men she has dated are Black. She published an essay last year, \u201cDating Black women: interracial dating gone right and wrong,\u201d in which she explained why so many Black women shun dating White men. Vaughn described what she and other Black women experienced on interracial dates:  non-Black men who fetishized their bodies, raised the topic of race when it wasn\u2019t necessary, or tried too hard \u201cto copy every single element of Black men\u201d because they \u201cwatched too much BET.\u201d When Vaughn dates White men, she chooses those who have dated Black women before. She cites one White man she dated who \u201cwas just cool.\u201d \u201cBy the time he met me, he had dated a bunch of Black women. It wasn\u2019t new to him \u2013 like me putting a hair wrap on my head was no big deal,\u201d she says. \u201cHe didn\u2019t ask what it was. He didn\u2019t ask why I oiled my hair. He had already been broken in.\u201d Nikki Buskirk is familiar with many of these arguments. She once believed some of them. She says some in her family raised her with the expectation that she would marry a Black man because such unions helped build strong Black families and strengthened their race. Some of them objected to her dating Tyler and thought she was going through a phase. She experienced some nagging guilt at the time but overcame it. They\u2019ve now been married for 17 years and have three sons, ages 10, 7 and 3. \u201cHe treats me like a queen,\u201d she says. \u201cI can\u2019t let guilt ruin the love we have and the love we built.\u201d Reservations about dating or marrying across races may seem like a relic from the past. Interracial marriage has steadily become more common in the US since the Supreme Court ruled in the 1967 Loving v. Virginia decision that laws banning such unions were unconstitutional. In 2015, one in 10 married people in the US had a spouse of a different race or ethnicity, according to a Pew Research Center study. Popular culture is filled with images of couples such as Prince Harry and his bride Meghan Markle or tennis star Serena Williams with husband Alexis Ohanian. But look closer at the lives of some Black women and the picture looks different. Many Black women seem trapped in a time warp where dating or marrying a White man is still rare. The same Pew report said Black men are twice as likely as Black women to have a spouse of a different race or ethnicity.  Some people try to nudge Black women into the interracial dating pool by citing a 2010 census statistic that found an estimated 71% of Black women between the ages of 25 to 29 had never been married. This historical reluctance to be with White men has generated a stream of articles, books, and talk show segments. One law professor wrote a book arguing that more Black women should \u201cnot marry down but out\u201d \u2013 in other words, consider marrying non-Black men instead of settling for Black men who don\u2019t meet their standards. Yet there are some Black women who don\u2019t want to compromise. As Stewart notes in her book, they are inspired by examples such as Michelle Obama\u2019s marriage and they want what she seems to have \u2013 a Black man they can respect and love. The wait for such a man, though, can be excruciating. Stewart cites a single Black woman who confessed she was emotionally exhausted from living without Black male company. \u201cShe just wanted Black male energy and presence in her life in some way,\u201d Stewart wrote. \u201cShe told me that she could go an entire week, even several weeks, without having a substantive conversation with a Black man who was not her brother.\u201d It\u2019s easy to cite Harris\u2019 marriage as an inspirational model for all people who say color doesn\u2019t matter. But color does matter to some. Consider colorism \u2013 the notion that a person\u2019s value and beauty is determined by the lightness of their skin. Harris is a fair-complexioned woman, Stewart notes. She cites a 2009 study that showed that young Black women who are fair complexioned were twice as likely to have married by age 29 than darker-skinned Black women. Colorism is a complex issue that spills into many areas of Black life, not just interracial marriage. Still, some darker-skinned Black women could look at Harris\u2019 marriage and take a different message about their own self-worth by concluding, \u201cthat could never be me.\u201d Stewart takes this issue head-on in her book. She writes that as more Black women pay attention to women like Harris, more \u201cwill likely transgress cultural prohibitions\u201d and try to date a wider pool of racially and ethnically diverse men. Harris\u2019 marriage could unwittingly reinforce another racist assumption: White men are the best potential marriage partners, while Black men are among the worst. \u201cThere is a conversation out there in social media now that goes something like this: Black women should just open themselves up to men outside their race,\u201d Stewart says. \u201cAnd the default men that a number of these social media influencers have in mind are White men.\u201d The attention paid to Harris\u2019 marriage could also distract people from addressing another huge issue: the precarious state of Black marriage, Stewart says. Stewart contends in her book that White supremacy has waged a systematic assault against Black marriage for 400 years. This attack has taken different forms: slavery, White standards of beauty, and mass incarceration, which removes Black men from the pool of potential partners. Many Black women are single today not because something is wrong with them, Stewart says. Instead, she says, their status is the result of a web of policies, customs and raw racism that make Black marriage \u201cdifficult, delayed or impossible.\u201d Stewart says she\u2019s not opposed to interracial unions. But she\u2019s concerned that encouraging Black women to marry non-Black men distracts people from addressing what many see as a crisis of Black marriage and romantic relationships. \u201cI don\u2019t want to solve this problem by ignoring it and asking Black women to marry outside their race,\u201d she says. Nikki Buskirk has heard the arguments that White men can\u2019t understand what it\u2019s like for Black women to experience racism. She reframes the argument: Can any guy understand? \u201cI can say that about any guy,\u201d she says. \u201cA Black guy might not understand what it means to be a Black woman. Black women are the lowest of the lows when it comes to the hierarchy in America.\u201d Buskirk says she hopes Black women who are leery of dating White men pay attention to how Emhoff treats Harris. \u201cThey could be missing out on something great if they let skin color stop them,\u201d she says. This country\u2019s history, though, is filled with examples of how people have allowed skin color to blind them to other people\u2019s humanity.  And interracial relationships can provoke all sorts of strong and conflicting emotions. When some people see a Black and White couple, they don\u2019t see two individuals \u2013 they see a projection of their own racial myths, insecurities and fantasies. Buskirk\u2019s reaction to Emhoff\u2019s chivalrous Election Night gesture evoked the symbolic power of Barack Obama\u2019s presidency, when seemingly throwaway moments \u2013 the President breaking into \u201cAmazing Grace\u201d at a funeral, Michelle Obama dancing with schoolchildren \u2013 elicited deep affection in Black Americans. Harris could do the same. Her marriage to Emhoff could inspire Black women to think anew about their dating and marital choices. That may depend, though, on whether Harris is willing to talk more about the delicate issues that swirl around her marriage. And whether a nation that is still so divided by race and skin color is ready to listen.",

            "article_content": "President Joe Biden called for racial justice and unity in America on Wednesday, acknowledging that the nation has been deeply divided by political forces and systemic racism. Biden, in his inaugural speech, denounced White supremacy and domestic terrorism and said the nation needs to be repaired and healed. \u201cA cry for racial justice, some 400 years in the making, moves us,\u201d Biden said. \u201cThe dream of justice for all will be deferred no longer.\u201d Biden promises to be 'a president for all Americans' The inauguration came exactly two weeks after White rioters stormed the US Capitol in their refusal to accept former President Donald Trump\u2019s loss. Biden also is assuming the presidency on the heels of Black Lives Matter protests last year that sparked a national reckoning on racism. The frustrations on both sides of this political divide have been exacerbated by a Covid-19 pandemic that has killed people of color at higher rates and Trump\u2019s attempts to undermine the integrity of the election. Black leaders say they are counting on Biden to unify the country and enact policies that address the disparities Black people face in housing, education, jobs, health care and voter suppression. They also want Biden to undo the harm caused by Trump with his offensive rhetoric toward people of color and refusal to address police brutality in the Black community. \u201cRacial equity requires more than individuals in positions. It requires a set of clear outcomes,\u201d NAACP President Derrick Johnson told CNN. Biden \u201chas an obligation to reverse what happened in the last four years. And it\u2019s very doable.\u201d Biden, he said, needs to end economic insecurity in communities of color and the \u201cpredatory\u201d police treatment of Black people, ensure equitable Covid-19 vaccine access, and remove social media platforms that spread hate. According to a CNN poll, 16% of Democrats believe that racial injustice is the most important problem facing the country right now while 65% say it is the coronavirus. Conversely, only 1% of Republicans say racial injustice is the most important issue with 32% choosing political divisions, 30% the economy, and 25% coronavirus. Biden to rescind 1776 commission via executive order Some civil rights leaders say they are confident Biden will keep every promise he made during his speech Wednesday. Richard \u201cMouse\u201d Smith, president of the Delaware NAACP and a lifelong friend of Biden\u2019s, said Biden earned the trust of Black people in Wilmington, Delaware, when he was a New Castle County councilor in the early 1970s who wasn\u2019t afraid to go into the community and discuss their concerns. \u201cHe brought love and respect and care for our community,\u201d Smith said. Wilmington\u2019s Black community was pleased with Biden\u2019s controversial Crime Bill of 1994 because it helped rid their neighborhoods of drugs, crime and slum houses, Smith said. Smith said he believes Biden will lead the policy change that Black people need for equal education, jobs, environmental justice and housing equity. \u201cHe has the ability to heal the country if people want the country to be healed,\u201d Smith said. \u201cHe can be a game changer and put evil and racism down.\u201d Biden\u2019s inaugural speech on Wednesday reflected the same \u201curgency of the moment\u201d with race relations as former President John F. Kennedy\u2019s speech in June 1963, said CNN presidential historian Timothy Naftali. That month, JFK addressed Americans about the need to affirm civil rights for all. Naftali said Biden joins a small group of US presidents that acknowledged civil rights as a moral issue. Notably, former presidents Barack Obama, Bill Clinton, Jimmy Carter, Lyndon B. Johnson and Kennedy were advocates for racial equality. \u201cThe country is begging for a pivot on racial justice issues,\u201d Naftali said. \u201cThe conversation has been started and the promise has been made and now it\u2019s time to watch how that unfolds.\u201d Maurice Mitchell, an organizer for the Movement for Black Lives and national director of the Working Families Party, said Biden is indebted to Black voters because they turned out in droves to elect him. Mitchell said he wants to see a \u201cgoverning agenda\u201d that makes investment in the Black community a priority. Racial justice, Covid-19 relief, climate justice and economic recovery are critical needs of Black Americans right now, he said. \u201cWe think it\u2019s clear that the folks who delivered the defeat of Donald Trump should be first when it comes to honoring the agenda,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cThe Biden and Harris administration have an opportunity to strike a new posture when it comes to the Black agenda as it relates to Black political power.\u201d The powerful duality of Kamala Harris' ascent Biden\u2019s inauguration took place two days after the Martin Luther King Jr. holiday which honors the legacy of the civil rights icon who died in 1968. King\u2019s son, Martin Luther King III, told CNN on Monday that he believes Biden and his administration should lead the country in bringing people together, and address the Covid-19 pandemic, police brutality and misconduct as well as climate change. \u201cWe\u2019re going to see a new air brought in,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will do better, we are much better than the behavior that we\u2019ve seen exhibited over the last few days.\u201d Other Black activists also demanded a concrete plan from Biden. The Rev. Michael W. Waters, a civil rights activist and author of \u201cSomething in the Water: A 21st Century Civil Rights Odyssey,\u201d called for a \u201cpurposeful redirecting of resources\u201d to uplift marginalized and oppressed communities. \u201cMillions of people still voted for Donald Trump and real threats exist to our vision of democracy,\u201d Waters said. \u201cBiden and Harris must embrace a radical platform of equity to redeem the soul of this nation.\u201d CNN\u2019s Jennifer Agiesta contributed.",

            "article_content": "Congress set a new diversity record this year with its highest-ever number of women and racial minorities, including 60 Black lawmakers. But that\u2019s mostly in the House. People of color have historically had a tougher time getting elected to the Senate. Newly elected Raphael Warnock is only the 11th Black US senator since the Senate convened for the first time in 1789. Only two of those have been women. And with the departure of Kamala Harris, the number of Black female US senators is now at zero. Voters in urban congressional districts tend to be more diverse and politically progressive, driving the higher number of minorities in the House. But that has had little effect on the number of Black senators. \u201cBlack US Senate candidates, and especially Black politically progressive Democratic candidates, have found it difficult to get traction and win statewide elections due to the default political conservatism in White majority regions of the US,\u201d says Karlos Hill, chair of African-American studies at the University of Oklahoma. From slavery and Jim Crow laws to suppression of minority voters, Black political candidates have long faced stumbling blocks. Hiram Revels, the first Black US senator, took office in the late 1800s as part of a wave of African American  lawmakers during the Reconstruction era, but he was elected by the Mississippi legislature, not the state\u2019s voters. Decades of voter suppression has limited Black voting power in the South, says Tobin Miller Shearer, director of African-American studies at the university of Montana. Shearer also cites the \u201cincomplete legacy of the 15th Amendment,\u201d which granted everyone the right to vote but was undermined by states in the deep South which disfranchised Black voters through literacy tests, property ownership requirements and other racist measures. It wasn\u2019t until 1965 that these discriminatory voting practices were outlawed by the federal Voting Rights Act. Half a century later Black voters in the South are wielding new power, thanks in part to a push by former Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams and other organizers to register new voters and combat voter suppression. \u201cBlack candidates can compete and win competitive statewide races if they are able to effectively mobilize the Black electorate,\u201d Hill says. \u201cIf the momentum created by Abrams and Warnock\u2019s recipe for mobilizing the Black electorate can be sustained, we could begin to see more Black representation in the US Senate. Only time will tell.\u201d Here are the 11 Black US senators: Hiram Revels was a former barber and minister who served in the US Senate from 1870-1871. Mississippi lawmakers chose him to fill a vacant seat, although he faced fierce opposition from his future colleagues who questioned his citizenship. Their argument was based on a 1857 Supreme Court case that ruled African Americans could not become citizens of the United States. Born a free man in 1827 \u2013 the slavery era \u2013 he was an army chaplain during the Civil War, working at churches in Kansas, Kentucky and Louisiana. After the war ended, he settled in Natchez, Mississippi, where he was an elder at the African Methodist Episcopal Church, and built a reputation as a respected community leader. Mississippi was seeking readmission to representation in the US Congress and needed to fill two Senate seats that had been unoccupied  since 1861, when it seceded from the Union. Revels was offered the shorter of  two terms \u2013 one set to expire in March 1871. Revels took the oath of office 22 days after the ratification of the 15th Amendment, which held that Americans could not be denied the right to vote based on their race. Revels was \u201cthe 15th Amendment in flesh and blood,\u201d civil rights activist Wendell Phillips said. Sen. Blanche K. Bruce of Mississippi was the first African American to serve a full term in the US Senate. Born into slavery, he could not attend school, so he sneaked in some lessons from a tutor hired for his master\u2019s son. He escaped at the beginning of the Civil War and taught Black students in Missouri before moving to Mississippi, where he held several jobs, including a county sheriff and tax collector. Like Revels, he was elected to the US senate by the Mississippi state legislature, not voters. Bruce served from 1875 to 1881. The former slave later became a plantation owner, and lived a privileged life that was a far cry from that of his Black constituents. Despite moving in elite circles, he fought for the rights of freed slaves and was a strong advocate for Black war veterans.  But Black people in Mississippi questioned his commitment to their plight. Sen. Edward Brooke of Massachusetts was the first African American elected to the US Senate by popular vote. He\u2019s also credited with integrating the Senate barbershop with his first haircut on Capitol Hill after his win. The former World War II Army veteran graduated from Howard University and then attended law school at Boston University. He served two full terms in the Senate, from 1967 to 1979. Brooke did not consider himself a trailblazing politician and maintained that he represented all his constituents.  \u201cI do not intend to be a national leader of the Negro people. I intend to do my job as a senator from Massachusetts,\u201d he once declared. He died in 2015 at the age of 95. Carol Moseley Braun shattered barriers as the first Black female US senator. Moseley Braun was also the first woman to serve on the powerful Finance Committee after Democrat Tom Daschle gave up his seat to create a spot for her. The Democrat from Illinois served only one term, from 1993 to 1999. Before joining the Senate, she was a prosecutor in the office of the United States Attorney in Chicago and assistant majority leader in the Illinois House of Representatives. She defeated both the Democratic incumbent and the Republican challenger for a seat in the US Senate, becoming the first female senator from Illinois as well. But she lost her bid for reelection to the Senate and unsuccessfully ran for president in 2004. \u201cI cannot escape the fact that I come to the Senate as a symbol of hope and change,\u201d she said shortly after being sworn in. \u201cNor would I want to, because my presence in and of itself will change the US Senate.\u201d In the nearly three decades since, there has only been one other female Black senator: Kamala Harris. Barack Obama was the fifth Black US senator and only the third one elected by voters. He took the oath of office in January 2005 after serving in the Illinois state senate for almost eight years.  Obama served one term in the Senate before running for President in 2008. A former community organizer in Chicago and the first Black president of the Harvard Law Review, Obama made history again as the first Black President of the United States. He became the 44th President and served two terms. Roland Burris was appointed in 2008 to fill President Obama\u2019s vacated seat in the US Senate. Before taking on that role, Burris was the first African American to win a statewide election when he was elected comptroller of Illinois in 1978. After serving as comptroller for over a decade, he became attorney general of Illinois. He served in the Senate until November 2010, when voters chose his successor in a special election. Citing fundraising difficulties, Burris chose to retire instead of running for a full term. In 2013 Tim Scott of South Carolina became the first African American US senator from the deep South since Reconstruction. The former entrepreneur worked in insurance and real estate, and served in the US House of Representatives before joining the Senate. He was appointed US senator in January 2013 after the resignation of his predecessor, then was elected to a full term in 2016. The lifelong resident of South Carolina has marveled at his family\u2019s remarkable journey, considering his grandfather once dropped out of school to pick cotton. \u201cOur family went from cotton to Congress in one lifetime,\u201d he said last year. William Cowan was appointed to fill John Kerry\u2019s seat after Kerry resigned in 2013 to become secretary of state. Before his appointment, Cowan was a partner in a law firm and served as chief of staff to Massachusetts governor Deval Patrick. His appointment in February 2013, a month after Scott, marked the first time two African Americans served in the US Senate simultaneously. Cowan spent less than six months in the Senate and chose not to run in a special election to decide who would serve the remainder of Kerry\u2019s term. Democrat Edward J. Markey won that race and has since been re-elected twice. Cory Booker was the first African American to represent New Jersey in the US Senate. He was the popular mayor of Newark, the state\u2019s largest city, before he joined the Senate after a special election in October 2013 following the death of Frank Lautenberg. The next year he was elected to a full term. The former Rhodes Scholar and Yale Law School graduate unsuccessfully ran for President in 2020 but was later reelected to the Senate. Kamala Harris was the first Black woman to represent California in the US senate when she took office in January 2017. But she was making history long before then. She was the first Black person and first woman elected district attorney of San Francisco and attorney general of California, a position she held until 2016. And she\u2019s still shattering glass ceilings. This month, she was sworn in as Vice President of the United States \u2013 the first woman, first Black woman and first Asian American to hold that post. Many advocates had called for a Black woman to replace her, but California Gov. Gavin Newsom instead appointed Alex Padilla, California\u2019s first Latino senator. While historic, it leaves no Black women in the upper chamber of the US Congress. \u201cWhen you think about the history of this country, of the challenges that exist for African Americans \u2026 this is a real blow to the African-American community, to African-American women, to women in general,\u201d San Francisco Mayor London Breed said. Rev. Raphael Warnock\u2019s win in a Georgia runoff election earlier this month played a big role in highlighting the growing power of Black voters in the South. Like Revels, his path to the US Senate followed a key role in a pulpit of the Black church. Warnock is a senior pastor at Atlanta\u2019s Ebenezer Baptist Church, where Martin Luther King served as co-pastor. Black voters in Atlanta and its suburbs turned out in big numbers to help him win. In his victory speech, Warnock reflected on his mother\u2019s teenage days picking cotton to in rural Georgia. He acknowledged how far the nation has come. \u201cBecause this is America, the 82-year-old hands that used to pick somebody else\u2019s cotton went to the polls and picked her youngest son to be a United States senator,\u201d he said. Along with Booker and Scott, he is one of three African Americans in the current Senate.",

            "article_content": "Before Proud Boys member Nick Ochs was arrested and charged in connection with the insurrection at the US Capitol, he raised $300 on the Christian-oriented website GiveSendGo.com  to help get him to DC. Following Ochs\u2019 arrest, a supporter turned to GiveSendGo to raise money for his legal defense, a campaign that has garnered nearly $20,000 for the member of the right-wing extremist group. The campaigns for Ochs weren\u2019t the only controversial causes on the site. A CNN review found more than two dozen fundraisers related to protesting the outcome of the presidential election, raising travel funds to attend the January 6 protest in Washington and other right-wing causes. Requests for comment from Alexander, Tarrio and Hoft went unanswered. Former Trump campaign staffers worked on National Mall rally the day of the Capitol riot Though the money raised through GiveSendGo for extremists and other controversial causes \u201cget a lot of limelight,\u201d the company\u2019s co-founder said the site hosts \u201cthousands\u201d of other campaigns that are in no way contentious. Still, the site has emerged as an alternative fundraiser for those who have been kicked off \u2013 or shunned by \u2013 larger crowdfunding platforms, such as GoFundMe. Jacob Wells, the co-founder of GiveSendGo, told CNN just because a cause may be unpopular it doesn\u2019t mean a person shouldn\u2019t have an opportunity to raise money from like-minded supporters. He said the decision at GiveSendGo about whether to allow someone to raise funds on the site is focused on the two-pronged question of whether it\u2019s legal and, if so, whether there\u2019s anything in its stated goal that\u2019s \u201cderogatory to anybody.\u201d GiveSendGo\u2019s terms and conditions prohibit any \u201cabusive or hateful language\u201d on its platform, as well as campaigns for \u201citems that promote hate, violence and racial intolerance.\u201d How Trump allies stoked the flames ahead of Capitol riot \u201cWe\u2019re not here to take sides,\u201d Wells said in an interview with CNN. \u201cWe don\u2019t necessarily condone on our platform a campaign any more than when you tweet on Twitter that Twitter somehow agrees with you,\u201d Wells said. Wells, who said he is a \u201cJesus guy\u201d as opposed to someone motivated by politics, likened the decision to host campaigns for groups or people that some may find unsavory to a missionary looking to save souls in a brothel. \u201cAs best we can, we\u2019re going to represent the hope of Jesus in every situation to people who use our platform,\u201d Wells said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to cover it all with grace.\u201d Critics, however, say GiveSendGo and others in the tech industry enable extremists by refusing to take a firm stand against them. The Proud Boys and other groups like them need \u201can architecture through which they can meet, recruit and finance themselves,\u201d said Imran Ahmed, CEO of the Center for Countering Digital Hate. \u201cBig tech has not just made it easy,\u201d Ahmed added. \u201cIt has turned a blind eye to extremist activities.\u201d Michael Hayden, a spokesman for the Southern Poverty Law Center, which tracks alleged hate groups, offered this blunt take: \u201cWe want to limit the capacity of these groups being able to get money in any way,\u201d he said. \u201cRepeatedly, we\u2019ve seen if the money is not there, the presence will not be there either.\u201d Send a tip:\n\nWe offer several ways to reach our journalists securely. Hayden brushed aside extremist groups\u2019 claims that their fundraising is protected free speech as a \u201cslanted and corrupted\u201d interpretation used to \u201cvilify those who seek to limit their power.\u201d Not every company\u2019s view on who can raise money is as charitable as GiveSendGo\u2019s. PayPal, for example, said it no longer provides services to GiveSendGo, citing unspecified violations of PayPal\u2019s Acceptable Use Policy. But Wells told CNN it was GiveSendGo that cut ties with PayPal rather than adhere to its demand that the company not cater to certain clients. \u201cThis is really coming down ideological lines,\u201d Wells said. \u201cWe\u2019re not just going to cut off one half of the population\u2019s ability to espouse their ideas or desires because the other side yells at us to do it.\u201d CNN did not independently authenticate all the campaigns or verify whether the funds reached their designated recipients. In many of the controversial cases, the campaigns remained on the GiveSendGo website but the ability to donate had been suspended. Wells said that action was not taken by GiveSendGo; rather, he said, it was the result of third-party vendors in charge of processing payments or the individual administrating the account. Not all the contributions on GiveSendGo are monetary. For folks inclined to give spiritual support, rather than financial, there is \u201cpray now\u201d button. The campaign for Help Storm the Captial (sic) Patriots Legal Defense, for example, got $10 from one anonymous donor, but received 12 prayers. Many of the fundraising campaigns GiveSendGo supports are of the sort Wells envisioned when he co-founded the giving platform with his sister seven years ago: A scholarship in the name of a beloved coach. A child in need of surgery. Five hundred dollars for \u201ccat supplies\u201d for a disabled couple caring for 14 rescued felines. The site exploded in popularity among the right over the summer when it began hosting a fundraiser for the legal defense of Kyle Rittenhouse, the Illinois teen charged with killing two people amid the unrest following the police shooting of Jacob Blake in Kenosha, Wisconsin. As first reported by the Daily Beast, GiveSendGo allowed the Rittenhouse fundraiser after it was banned by GoFundMe. Rittenhouse claimed he was there to protect people and property from rioters and opened fire in self-defense. Prosecutors charged the 17-year-old with two felony charges of homicide. While the case had a polarizing effect, Wells told CNN, \u201cIn my opinion, the media tried to paint a very one-sided story about what happened.\u201d Since launching the GiveSendGo fundraising effort, Rittenhouse\u2019s supporters have exceeded their stated goal of half a million dollars, raising $585,940 from more than 13,000 donors, according to the website. GiveSendGo has also provided a platform for a number of police officers involved in controversial uses of force, Wells said, including the police officer charged with killing George Floyd, an officer who pulled the trigger in the raid on Breonna Taylor\u2019s apartment, and the Wisconsin officer who shot Jacob Blake. Authorities have since declined to file criminal charges against any officers for Taylor\u2019s death or for the shooting of Blake. The officer charged with Floyd\u2019s killing is awaiting trial. Wells said GiveSendGo\u2019s growing popularity has coincided with improved financial performance. Once \u201ca labor of love\u201d that made little money, he said he expects campaigns on the site to bring in $20 to $30 million in 2021, from which the company takes a cut of at least 3%. Along with its increased popularity, the site has drawn additional scrutiny from the media, including in a recent article by The Washington Post about fundraising related to the Proud Boys and other controversial causes. Eugene Volokh, a UCLA law professor who specializes in First Amendment issues, said there was nothing illegal \u2013 or, in his view, immoral \u2013 about GiveSendGo\u2019s business. \u201cWhatever you might think about Kyle Rittenhouse, I hope we can agree that he is entitled to a criminal defense,\u201d Volokh said. \u201cIf people want to help hire lawyers, in part because of their ideological views, that\u2019s something that is constitutionally protected.\u201d Ochs, the Proud Boys member, charged in connection with the siege on the Capitol, did not return a phone call seeking comment for this article. He previously told CNN that he was working as a professional journalist when he entered the building, and that he didn\u2019t go into any congressional offices or the chambers. \u201cWe didn\u2019t have to break in, I just walked in and filmed,\u201d he said hours after the siege. CJ Grisham, a Proud Boys member from Texas, who raised funds on GiveSendGo for tactical gear so the group can be \u201cready at a moment\u2019s notice to protect our communities,\u201d said the Proud Boys should be entitled to raise funds just like anyone else. He said his fundraising campaign brought in nearly $5,000 for a cause he explicitly stated was nonviolent, but that he has so far been denied any money because a third-party vendor that processes payments for GiveSendGo decided his campaign was \u201ctoo risky.\u201d \u201cWho gets to decide what a good cause is?\u201d Grisham asked. \u201cAre we gonna let big tech decide what a good cause is?\u201d",

            "article_content": "Ahead of Wednesday\u2019s transition of power, Black voters in Atlanta say they are feeling more represented and are hopeful for the future despite the divisiveness the country has experienced over the last four years. They have been bolstered by their success in helping President-elect Joe Biden win in Georgia on Election Day and by changing the state\u2019s representation in the US Senate in the two runoff elections, races in which Black voters played a crucial role. For the first time, Georgia has a Black senator, Raphael Warnock, who along with fellow Democrat Jon Ossoff defeated Republican candidates Sens. Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue in the January 5 showdown that determined control of the US Senate. And with Kamala Harris about to become vice president, another series of firsts will occur this week \u2013 the first woman vice president, the first Black vice president and the first Indian American vice president. \u201cI have two young sons and just to see people in office that looked like me gives me hope for the future, the future for them,\u201d Tagan Lovett told CNN. Lovett and her friends, Tierra Carter and Lisan Douglas, said they are excited and hopeful that the outcome of these elections will help change the US for the better. \u201cI\u2019m ready for the change. I\u2019m done with the division, and I\u2019m ready for us to unite as a country slowly. I know it\u2019s not going to happen overnight. It\u2019s not going to happen in four years, eight years, maybe even 20, but just a different direction,\u201d Carter said. \u201cHopefully, we\u2019ll have someone in an office that cares about the people, like actually cares about the people,\u201d Douglas told CNN. \u201cWe have a lot of politicians that say they do, and they speak all this rhetoric, but they show no action.\u201d Douglas said she\u2019s ready to see action from lawmakers and officials. \u201cWe\u2019ve heard it all the talk. We\u2019ve heard all the speeches,\u201d she said. \u201cLet\u2019s see the action what\u2019s going to happen. Let\u2019s get it done.\u201d In the face of political divisions that have rocked the country \u2013 and which hit their nadir during the January 6 storming of the Capitol by supporters of President Donald Trump \u2013 these voters think the new faces can help the US turn a new chapter. \u201cMy hope is that we can all come together as a nation. Like we\u2019re all, again, Americans, we\u2019re all living in America and we need to like, just come together,\u201d Lovett said. \u201cThis isn\u2019t gonna work with just this division. It\u2019s just not. And I I\u2019m just hopeful.\u201d Kevin Scandrett, a self-proclaimed ATLien from Atlanta\u2019s West Side, was impressed by the campaign to encourage voting in the state. \u201cTo have the state of Georgia and the city of Atlanta be so pivotal in the presidential election, it\u2019s really, really heartwarming,\u201d Scandrett told CNN. He\u2019s hopeful that Biden will keep his promises and help guide the country away from divisiveness. \u201cIt\u2019s a sense of relief, so much going on, all these last four years. I mean a whole lot of racial tension,\u201d Scandrett said. \u201cIt\u2019s just a good thing that we can finally move forward as a society.\u201d Scandrett\u2019s mother Denise James said the division of the last few years was \u201cvery hurtful.\u201d She said she couldn\u2019t believe what happened on January 6, when a mob of people overtook the US Capitol, sending politicians into hiding and disrupting the formal presidential vote verification. Pentagon chief says 'no intelligence indicating an insider threat' to inauguration as FBI vets National Guard \u201cI thought it was another country. I couldn\u2019t believe that our country was actually fighting each other,\u201d she said, choking up. \u201cWe got to call the National Guard to protect us.\u201d James shares her sons\u2019 hope for a better, less divided future with Biden at the helm following his inauguration on Wednesday. \u201cI feel very hopeful. Not just because of Joe Biden, but because I know that he has the whole world in his hand. So, we are going to be all right. We\u2019re going to be good.\u201d In Atlanta, Black radio remains an important grapevine for voters and the V103 station has kept listeners engaged in the city\u2019s trending topics. Host Big Tigger entertains commuters with his popular radio show, and in 2020, it not only provided entertainment and witty banter, but also political discourse and a platform to reach voters. \u201cWe had Vice President-elect Joe Biden. We had Jon Ossoff.  We had Senator Warnock. I love saying Senator Warnock, we had, Kamala Harris. She called on my birthday, which was awesome. Wish me happy birthday. Uh, we had Stacy Abrams,\u201d Big Tigg said. When Georgia flipped the two Senate seats, Big Tigg and his co-hosts Ms. Basketball and Tylerchronicles, whose real name is Troy Fluker, fielded call after call of excitement and optimism. \u201cPeople were so happy because after having so many bad things happen in 2020, it was like a sigh of relief. Like, yes, something\u2019s finally going our way,\u201d said Christina Granville, AKA Ms. Basketball. \u201cIt felt a lot more hopeful before what happened at the Capitol,\u201d Big Tigg, whose real name is Darian Morgan, told CNN. \u201cBut at the same time, lots of people are hopeful that, OK, now maybe we can get on a better path. We know it\u2019s not gonna all get fixed immediately\u2026We know we have a lot of work still to do, but at least maybe we have the right people that are in our corner that reflect our interests.\u201d Isaac Lee Hayes III, the son of the late soul musician and actor Isaac Hayes, is a record producer and content creator who believes Atlanta and Georgia have helped spark a new movement in the South. \u201cIt was completely critical because there\u2019s so much on the line, especially with healthcare, $15 minimum wage, this pandemic, you know, assistance to people that need it.\u201d Hayes said Black voters in the South have for years been ignored and overlooked.  He thinks the high voter turnout, especially among the state\u2019s Black residents is a positive step. The world has more riding on Joe Biden than any US president in decades \u201cWe showed up heavy, you know what I\u2019m saying? We let our voice be heard. And I think voting is becoming part of our culture. \u2026 Georgia came through with flying colors.\u201d The record turnout of voters in the Peach State signified hope is on the horizon for many.  This was echoed over and over again by Black voters from around the city. \u201cMy hope is that we can all come together as a nation,\u201d Kevin Taylor told CNN. \u201cI\u2019m hoping for more peace, more coming together, more love.\u201d",

            "article_content": "An enraged White man thrusts the sharp point of an American flagpole toward a helpless Black man. A snarling police dog lunges at a civil rights protester. A White police officer presses his knee on the neck of an unconscious Black suspect. Each of these blistering images from history changed the way Americans talked about race and exposed truths that many had long denied. The January 6 assault on the US Capitol has added some new entries to that grim gallery. Many Americans are still reeling from seeing images of what\u2019s been called a \u201cWhite riot\u201d \u2013 an assault on Congress by supporters of President Donald Trump, which left five people dead. It\u2019s been described as \u201cthe most dramatic challenge to the US democratic system since the civil war,\u201d but its impact on racial justice has been undersold. Many have noted the racial dimensions to the insurrection, in which at least one Capitol rioter carried a Confederate flag. One commentator said that if the mob was Black, the Capitol\u2019s marbled \u201challways would be red with their blood.\u201d House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said the mob chose their \u201cwhiteness over democracy.\u201d But I believe the Capitol riot could have a far-reaching impact on racial justice in America \u2013 bigger, even, than last summer\u2019s George Floyd protests. In some ways, it already has. Here are five reasons why the Capitol insurrection offers an opportunity for transformative change. Consider the impact of last year\u2019s George Floyd protests \u2013 what they did, and what they failed to do. Floyd\u2019s death last May at the hands of a White police officer in Minnesota sparked what some consider the largest protest movement in American history. An estimated 15 to 26 million Americans of all races took to the streets to protest police brutality last summer. Local and state politicians proposed laws to reform policing and combat racism. Corporations posted Black Lives Matter on their websites. Sales of anti-racism books soared. But here\u2019s what the protests didn\u2019t do: They didn\u2019t stop Trump from getting 74 million votes six months later in November\u2019s election \u2013 more than any president before him. Trump may be leaving office, but his corrosive influence isn\u2019t going away. Critics say the President is responsible for returning White supremacy to mainstream politics. For years, a large segment of White America continued to support him no matter what he said or did. The Floyd protests didn\u2019t loosen Trump\u2019s hold on the Republican party or large swaths of White America.   The fallout from the Capitol assault, though, may cause irreversible damage to Trump\u2019s brand. The House of Representatives impeached him \u2013 again \u2013 for inciting violence against the US government. Some Republican lawmakers are now openly breaking with him. His approval rating has sunk to its lowest level ever. Corporations and banks are cutting ties with the Trump Organization. \u201cHis entire legacy was wiped out yesterday,\u201d Rep. Nancy Mace, a Republican freshman from South Carolina, told CNN a day after the Capitol assault. It\u2019s true that Trump remains the most dominant force in the Republican Party. It may be premature to write his political obituary. But the stain of the Capitol riot may follow him, his family and their supporters in Congress for the rest of their lives. The shame of the Capitol riot will haunt many of Trump\u2019s followers as well. \u201cThe heartbeat of racism is denial,\u201d the race scholar Ibram X. Kendi once said. \u201cThe American creed of denial \u2014 \u2018I\u2019m not a racist\u2019 \u2014 knows no political parties, no ideologies, no colors, no regions.\u201d It was easier for a segment of White America to deny their racism during the Floyd protests. They could say the four police officers charged in Floyd\u2019s death were just a few bad apples. They could tune out debates about abstract terms like \u201csystemic racism.\u201d They could attack a clumsy political slogan like \u201cdefund the police\u201d to justify defending the status quo. The Capitol riot, though, has made it much more difficult for White Americans to deny our country has a huge problem with White supremacy. It\u2019s forced many Americans to see how dangerous White supremacy is in a way that the Floyd protests did not. You can see this shift in the language people are using to describe members of the Capitol mob. They\u2019ve called the assault an \u201cinsurrection\u201d and a \u201ccoup from below\u201d and argued that White supremacy is incompatible with democracy. Few, if any, described the accusations of police brutality that fanned the Floyd protests in such a stark way. The images of the Capitol mob also show how White supremacy is wielded by many ordinary White Americans. Not everyone in the mob was a White supremacist. But the White people who waved a Confederate flag in the Capitol Rotunda, built a makeshift gallows on the Capitol grounds and forced lawmakers to flee for their lives represented a broad swath of America. \u201cThese were not just the Trump loyalists of lore, that economically marginalized, over-elegized white working class of the heartland, columnist Farhad Manjoo wrote in The New York Times. \u201cNo, the crowd that stormed the Capitol was a big tent of whiteness, a cross-section of American society bridging divisions of class, geography and demography. They were doctors and lawyers, florists and real estate agents, business executives, police officers, military veterans, at least one elected official and an Olympic gold medalist. They\u2019d all come to coup for America.\u201d The Capitol rioters didn\u2019t just embarrass themselves \u2013 they embarrassed the country they profess to love. The riot occurred as the US is jockeying with Russia and China for global influence. Russia and Iran ridiculed the US on social media over the riot, while Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan, whose government has been accused of human rights violations, called the mob \u201ca disgrace for democracy.\u201d The riot occurred the same week that China cracked down on Hong Kong\u2019s democracy movement with mass arrests. \u201cThere is no way to \u2026 ignore the power of the message that these events send to both the friends and the enemies of democracy, everywhere,\u201d the historian, Anne Applebaum, wrote in a recent essay.  \u201cThe images from Washington that are going out around the world are far more damaging to America\u2019s reputation as a stable democracy than the images of young people protesting the Vietnam War several decades ago, and they are far more disturbing to outsiders than the riots and protests of last summer.\u201d But the Capitol crisis also presents an opportunity for racially transformative change at the federal level. It\u2019s happened before, under similar circumstances. The US was locked in a global struggle with Russia for the hearts and minds of people when the civil rights movement took flight in the 1950s and 1960s. Civil rights leaders leveraged our Cold War rivalry to help pass sweeping civil rights laws. The 1963 civil rights campaign in Birmingham, Alabama, offered a classic example. Images of Black protesters being attacked by police dogs and sprayed with firehoses were beamed around the world. Foreign governments attacked American leaders for their hypocrisy in preaching the virtues of democracy abroad while hanging \u201cWhites only\u201d signs at home. White supremacy became a national security issue. The ugly fallout from the protests in Birmingham forced President John Kennedy to propose a bill that became the 1964 Civil Rights Act, which outlawed segregation in public accommodations and made employment discrimination illegal. In a nationally televised speech announcing his bill, Kennedy said the US was \u201ccommitted to a worldwide struggle\u201d to promote freedom, and now was the time for the nation to \u201cfulfill its promise.\u201d \u201cWe preach freedom around the world, and we mean it, and we cherish our freedom here at home,\u201d Kennedy said, \u201cbut are we to say to the world \u2013 and much more importantly, to each other \u2013 that this is the land of the free except for the Negroes?\u201d The Capitol mob has created the same type of political environment for change. The Floyd protests sparked some changes at local and state levels and led a cultural shift among Whites who began to consider their own racism. But they have yet to bring any racially transformative changes at the federal level. The Capitol insurrection, however, has created the conditions for such potential changes under President-elect Joe Biden. Consider the political appetite for racially transformative change in a new Congress where both Houses are controlled by the Democrats and the GOP is now in disarray. Start with voting rights reform. There is no racial issue more important than voting rights. A famous 19th-century Supreme Court decision declared that voting is \u201ca fundamental political right, because [it is] preservative of all rights.\u201d It\u2019s easy to forget, but the Capitol riot was sparked by some voters\u2019 distrust of elections. Trump and some Republican lawmakers claim, without evidence, that the Presidential Election was stolen by voter fraud. Progressives counter that Republicans employ such tactics as voter purges, restricting early voting and closing polling stations in predominantly Black communities. There\u2019s a growing sense that America\u2019s electoral system is broken. One voting rights expert says this is the perfect opportunity for Congress to repair the damage done by the Supreme Court\u2019s 2013 Shelby County v. Holder decision, which opened the door to voter suppression tactics by removing a key enforcement mechanism of the Voting Rights Act. Democrats could pass an updated version of what\u2019s now being called the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, which would block voter purges, ensure easy access to early voting and restore federal supervision of voting changes in states with a history of voter suppression, says Richard L. Hasen, a professor at the University of California, Irvine. The new Congress could also cite the mayhem at the Capitol building as a reason to crack down on social media platforms where users spread misinformation about voter fraud. Several Democratic leaders say social media helped spark the riot. \u201cCongress was attacked \u2026 by a mob that was radicalized in an echo chamber that Facebook and other big platforms created,\u201d said Democratic Rep. Tom Malinowski of New Jersey. These potential changes \u2013 new federal laws expanding voting rights and regulating social media platforms \u2013 aren\u2019t as dramatic as the throngs of protesters that flooded American streets last summer. But they are potentially more racially transformative. Many Americans are still stunned by what happened at the Capitol. An outgoing President who many consider to be a White supremacist tried to incite lawmakers and citizens to overturn a legitimate election and block an incoming administration which includes the nation\u2019s first Black and South Asian vice-president. For some, the Capitol mob\u2019s actions reminded them of White terrorism in the Jim Crow South. White militia groups such as the \u201cRed Shirts\u201d  used violence to intimidate voters and attack Blacks. In 1898, an armed White mob staged a coup against a multiracial government in Wilmington, North Carolina, and killed more than 60 Black people. There\u2019s also a growing recognition that what the Capitol mob did is nothing new. \u201cSince the nation\u2019s founding, a large portion of White citizens have embraced free and democratic elections only when the political system did not require them to share power with people of color,\u201d the historian Joshua Zeitz wrote in a recent essay for Politico. Arnold Schwarzenegger, the Austrian-born former Republican governor of California, said it reminded him of Kristallnacht \u2014 the \u201cNight of Broken Glass\u201d \u2014 an infamous episode in 1938 in which a mob of Nazi sympathizers rampaged through Jewish neighborhoods in Germany, killing Jews and destroying synagogues and Jewish-owned stores. \u201cWednesday was the day of broken glass right here in the United States,\u201d Schwarzenegger said. \u201cThe broken glass was in the windows of the United States Capitol. But the mob did not just shatter the windows of the Capitol. They shattered the ideals we took for granted. They did not just break down the doors of the building that housed American democracy. They trampled the very principles on which our country was founded.\u201d How the Biden administration channels the outrage of people like Schwarzenegger will be critical in the weeks ahead. Many Americans see the Capitol rioters as patriots and freedom fighters. Some on the far right have praised the assault as a \u201csecond revolution.\u201d How future Americans view the Capitol assault will also depend on what vision of America prevails \u2013 Trumpism or the egalitarian principles that Schwarzenegger evoked. If the forces that drove rioters to ransack Congress gain permanent political power, the notion of citizens choosing their Whiteness over democracy won\u2019t seem so offensive. But if America fulfills what Kennedy called \u201cits promise,\u201d those images of White supremacists in the Capitol Rotunda will join the shameful gallery of photos that includes the 1963 Birmingham protests. The rioters will be viewed as symbols of a bygone America its citizens have left behind.",

            "article_content": "The president of an Atlanta synagogue says its website was the target of a cyberattack during its annual Martin Luther King Jr. Shabbat service with US Sen.-elect Raphael Warnock\u2019s Ebenezer Baptist Church. People who tried to watch Friday\u2019s virtual service via the synagogue\u2019s website were unable to, Kent Alexander, president of The Temple, wrote in a letter sent Saturday to the congregation. The Temple\u2019s website service provider told the synagogue\u2019s executive director that \u201c\u2018malicious user agents\u2019 had continuously loaded the Temple website with the objective of shutting it down,\u201d Alexander\u2019s letter said. The executive director was told it was the \u201clargest-ever attack affecting the provider\u2019s network,\u201d Alexander wrote, blocking not just The Temple, but the provider\u2019s other synagogue clients across the country. \u201cEventually, access was restored for all, but The Temple was last,\u201d Alexander said. \u201cOur site was down for over an hour into the service.\u201d Senator-elect Warnock contrasts his election with the Capitol attack in his first sermon back \u201cPresumably, The Temple was singled out by a racist and anti-Semitic group or individual bent on silencing our joint Temple-Ebenezer Baptist Church MLK Jr. Shabbat,\u201d Alexander wrote, noting the service featured a sermon by Warnock, who will become Georgia\u2019s first Black senator after winning a close runoff election earlier this month. For members who missed the service, it is still available to watch on YouTube, Facebook and the synagogue\u2019s website, the letter said. \u201cAuthorities are conducting an investigation,\u201d the letter said. CNN has reached out to The Temple and local authorities for additional information. The MLK Jr. Shabbat service is an annual event honoring King\u2019s legacy held by The Temple, the oldest Jewish congregation in the city, along with the historic Ebenezer Baptist Church, where King was a pastor from 1960 until his assassination in 1968. The Temple has its own historical ties to the civil rights movement. Its rabbi in the late 1950s was Jacob Rothschild, an outspoken advocate for racial equality. In October 1958, The Temple was bombed by suspected white supremacists in response to Rothschild\u2019s activism, though no one was ever convicted of the crime. Rothschild later befriended King, per The Temple and city of Atlanta\u2019s websites, and delivered a eulogy for King at a memorial service organized by Atlanta clergy members.

            "article_content": "The perceived success of last week\u2019s deadly insurrection at the US Capitol is \u201clike putting gasoline on a fire\u201d and may serve as a motivator for attacks in the run up to the inauguration, with electoral battleground states and those that have already seen protests among the most vulnerable, security experts say. The FBI warning that armed protests are being planned in all 50 states in the days leading up to President-elect Joe Biden\u2019s inauguration has prompted governors and police chiefs to deploy thousands of officers and equipment at state capitols around the country to thwart potential violence. What we know about potential armed protests ahead of Joe Biden's inauguration \u201cThe threats are very credible. And you\u2019re coming off a Washington protest that was credible, and let\u2019s just call it \u2018successful\u2019 in the eyes of protesters,\u201d said Timothy Dimoff, a former SWAT team leader who operates a security consulting company. \u201cIt\u2019s going to fuel their confidence that they can continue because we didn\u2019t show \u2018em we could control \u2018em.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s like putting gasoline on a fire,\u201d Dimoff continued. \u201cNow we sent \u2018em home and said you guys had a successful game plan and can do it again. That\u2019s where the problem is.\u201d US officials on Wednesday warned of future attacks, in part because of the success of the siege last week. The FBI bulletin noted that extremists could zero in on government officials and institutions, as well as racial and religious minorities, journalists, and members of the LGBTQ+ community. It also indicated that the Capitol insurrection may have served as a venue for extremists of differing ideological motivations to foster connections. After the attack, people who descended upon the Capitol went home, where a number have since been arrested and charged in their roles in the assault. John Miller, a deputy commissioner of intelligence and counterterrorism in the New York Police Department, called the movement that participated in the attack last week \u201cloosely organized\u201d and noted that people had come together over social media. \u201cThe propensity of the violence sometimes boils down to the individual,\u201d he said Thursday. \u201cNothing compares to any past threats; we have never had Americans fighting Americans on the streets of the nation\u2019s capital probably since the Civil War.\u201d They swore to protect America. Some also joined the riot Other motivations that could fuel future attacks include anti-government sentiment held by extremists, as well as grievances associated with the false narrative that the 2020 presidential election was stolen, according to Wednesday\u2019s bulletin. \u201cWhat you see now is a coalescing of the movement,\u201d said Jason Blazakis, who retired from the State Department\u2019s Bureau of Counterterrorism in 2018. He said various extremist groups that had operated alone over the last four years moved in concert during the assault on the Capitol last week. \u201cThe heave-ho of everyone getting through \u2013 you have Oath Keepers next to Proud Boys next to white supremacists, that\u2019s what makes this a dangerous time,\u201d he said. \u201cThe movement is energized and they\u2019re emboldened by surprise success on [January] 6th. I think they\u2019re surprised. They didn\u2019t plan to Nth degree, and to be able to breach the pillar of democracy, that\u2019s going to motivate them.\u201d The biggest threats to centers of government in the coming days will be in states that previously saw protests, including those against Covid-19 restrictions, and in electoral battlegrounds that were key to Biden\u2019s defeat of Trump, Dimoff said. Capitols in some Midwest states \u201care being targeted because they\u2019re looked at as reasons for Trump not being elected,\u201d he said. \u201cGroups want to blame somebody or something and that\u2019s what they\u2019re doing right now.\u201d \u201cYou can\u2019t take it lightly. You should always over prepare,\u201d Dimoff said. Armed militia members in Michigan, where it\u2019s legal to carry firearms in the open, are planning a protest this Sunday. The state\u2019s attorney general warned the Capitol was not safe. The capital city of Lansing\u2019s mayor has requested the National Guard and police there have put up heavy fencing around the Capitol. Michigan remained a flash point during 2020 as armed protesters gathered at the capitol in April to demonstrate against the state\u2019s pandemic shutdown orders. The state was also the center of an alleged plot by extremists to kidnap the governor prior to the 2020 presidential election. US says Capitol rioters intended to 'capture and assassinate' elected officials In Pennsylvania, the state\u2019s Capitol police agency is keeping special emergency response teams in place and hundreds of the state\u2019s National Guard force have been deployed in the state instead of going to Washington to bolster security at home. There have been demonstrations at the Harrisburg Capitol in Pennsylvania since the election concluded, including at the swearing in of new members of the House and Senate. Protests have remained peaceful, according to State Rep. Joanna McClinton, who fears that those who have protested before now feel emboldened since the events last week in DC. She said that state lawmakers who questioned the election results deserve some of the blame. \u201cThere are state lawmakers who have been co-conspirators in these lies, in questioning the outcome of the election,\u201d McClinton said. \u201cTrump lost, and our local lawmakers in the state Capitol have not been telling that truth. And as a result, maybe they didn\u2019t send anybody to DC on a bus. Maybe only a few of them were down there that we saw on social media, but they\u2019re complicit in this terror.\u201d Far-right groups, said Blazakis, have historically been a \u201cfractured movement.\u201d \u201cThe fracturing we\u2019ve witnessed may be evolving to a point where, if they could find a figurehead it could be really dangerous to unite these organizations,\u201d he said. In the aftermath of the deadly insurrection at the US Capitol, authorities are taking the threat seriously, Blazakis said. \u201cOne could argue [January] 6th was their one shot to strike a real big blow and, in the end, five or six people were killed and it could have been a lot, a lot worse,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd people see how serious it is \u2014 it\u2019s more than just online talk \u2014 and [the attackers] may not be able to replicate it as successfully. The saving grace is they may have missed their one big opportunity.\u201d CNN\u2019s Andy Rose, Kay Jones, Shimon Prokupecz, Barbara Starr, Raja Razek, Jon Passantino, Jason Carroll, Julian Cummings, Konstantin Toropin, Rebekah Riess contributed to this report",

            "article_content": "Hours before President Donald Trump was impeached for his role in inciting last week\u2019s deadly attack, several lawmakers described the rioters as White supremacists. \u201cLet us be clear, this was a domestic terror attack perpetrated by riotist mobs of White supremacists, armed equipped and many skilled in police and military tactics who came to overturn an election in which their candidate Trump lost,\u201d Rep. Joyce Beatty of Ohio and chair of the Congressional Black Caucus said in the group\u2019s hearing. During the impeachment debate Wednesday to excoriate Trump, Rep. Cori Bush of Missouri, who was a veteran BLM activist before becoming a legislator, called the President \u201cWhite supremacist in chief.\u201d \u201cMadam Speaker, St. Louis and I rise in support of the article of impeachment against Donald J Trump. If we fail to remove a White supremacist President who incited a white supremacist insurrection, it\u2019s communities like Missouri\u2019s First District that suffer the most,\u201d Bush said during her speech. Rioters stormed the US Capitol building last week, unleashing a wave of comparisons to last year\u2019s Black Lives Matter protests. The difference in police response was striking and there\u2019s more that sets them apart. People marched by the thousands in both after believing that a wrong had been done to them. The calls for racial justice across America over the summer were backed by the deaths of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and the pain of following generations of anti-Blackness sentiment. Unlike BLM protests, the insurrection at the Capitol was triggered by lies and deeply rooted racist stereotypes, experts say. Convinced that the presidential election was stolen, rioters touted themselves as \u201cpatriots\u201d and repeatedly chanted \u201cUSA, USA\u201d while vandalizing and destroying the building at the heart of America\u2019s democracy. Trump, who has embraced dog whistle tactics such as calling Mexicans \u201crapists\u201d and called the words Black Lives Matter a \u201csymbol of hate,\u201d incited them. \u201cOnce something like that feels true, you can\u2019t dissuade them with the facts,\u201d said Ian Haney L\u00f3pez, the author of \u201cDog Whistle Politics: How Coded Racial Appeals Have Reinvented Racism and Wrecked the Middle Class.\u201d Here\u2019s a look what\u2019s driven the Black Lives Matter movement for nearly a decade and why Trump supporters broke into the Capitol: After weeks of hearing false claims that the presidential election was rigged, Trump supporters flocked to Washington to fight against the ceremonial counting of the electoral votes that would confirm President-elect Joe Biden\u2019s win. Hours before the insurrection, Trump addressed a crowd of supporters gathered on the Ellipse near the White House, fanning false allegations of voter fraud and telling them to \u201cfight like hell.\u201d \u201cI absolutely stand 100% behind what happened here today,\u201d Todd Possett, who was part of last week\u2019s mob, told CNN\u2019s Donie Sullivan.  \u201cIt\u2019s terrible how this election was stolen. I had to come here and do my patriotic duty.\u201d Marc Morial, president and CEO of the National Urban League, said Wednesday the mob was motivated by racial resentment and \u201ca conspiracy theory rooted in the effort to invalidate Black folks.\u201d \u201cThe mob was met with empathy and deference from some in law enforcement and some in a military establishment that harbors White supremacists, let\u2019s say it, amongst its own ranks,\u201d Morial testified at Congressional Black Caucus hearing in response to the riots. After the election, Detroit, Milwaukee, Philadelphia and Camden, New Jersey, were among the cities the Trump campaign had falsely accused of voter fraud and corruption. These cities are either majority Black or have large Black populations. During a press conference in November, Trump\u2019s personal attorney, Rudy Giuliani, said, \u201cYou knew if you lived in Philadelphia. Unless you\u2019re stunod \u2013 that\u2019s an Italian expression for stupid \u2013 unless you\u2019re stupid, you knew that a lot of people were coming over from Camden to vote,\u201d he said. \u201cThey do every year. Happens all the time in Philly. \u2026 And it\u2019s allowed to happen because it\u2019s a Democrat (sic), corrupt city, and has been for years. Many, many years. And they carried it out in places where they could get away from it.\u201d Rioters believed a narrative deeply rooted in racist stereotypes that has been consistent throughout Trump\u2019s administration and used by other politicians in the past 50 years, according to Haney L\u00f3pez, who is a law professor at the University of California, Berkeley. Rioters breached US Capitol security on Wednesday. This was the police response when it was Black protesters on DC streets last year \u201cMainly what they\u2019re trying to trigger is a sense that dangerous persons of color are coming to take over the country,\u201d Haney L\u00f3pez said. \u201cThey believe it because in their hearts it feels true that this multi-racial coalition is taking power,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s just wrong to them that Black people in coalition with Latinos and Asian Americans and Whites should take power.\u201d Political leaders have long used dog-whistle phrases to exploit White America\u2019s racial fears. Some of those terms are \u201cillegal alien,\u201d \u201cthug,\u201d and \u201cWelfare Queen,\u201d which was used by President Ronald Reagan when he ran for the Republican presidential nomination in 1976 to attack welfare chiselers during campaign speeches. In his first public remarks to reporters since the insurrection, Trump insisted his speech inciting the riot was \u201ctotally appropriate.\u201d He claimed the \u201creal problem\u201d is what other politicians said about protests over the summer in Seattle and Portland, Oregon. The insurrection at the Capitol was also a stunning show of force for the fringe movements with several symbols of white supremacist and extremist groups on display. In 2013, the unexpected verdict in the murder trial in the killing of Trayvon Martin, a 17-year-old Black teen who had been walking in his father\u2019s Florida neighborhood, led to the birth of Black Lives Matter \u2013 one of the most well-known organizations fighting for the well-being of Black people. What started as a hashtag became a website, an organization and later grew into more than a dozen local chapters across the US and Canada. They were driven by the series of deaths of Black Americans at the hands of police and vigilantes. According to the BLM website, its mission is \u201cto eradicate white supremacy and build local power to intervene in violence inflicted on Black communities by the state and vigilantes.\u201d But BLM\u2019s goal isn\u2019t just about protesting police brutality. At the local level, the organization advocates for mutual aid, defunding police and access to housing and health care for Black and brown workers. How Black Lives Matter went from a hashtag to a global rallying cry \u201cWe live in a country built to keep us away from these resources that we need,\u201d says Kailee Scales, managing director of the Black Lives Matter Global Network. \u201cFolks in the movement have been consistently fighting to reverse that trend, to raise awareness that this is not the way we\u2019re supposed to live.\u201d Studies show that segregation persists in many American cities, leaving majority Black neighborhoods behind. Black communities don\u2019t have the same access as Whites to health care, quality education, good jobs and other resources. \u201cYou know, for many of us in this country, we know what it is to be treated differently. And we also know what it is to be told that all of the things we experience every single day don\u2019t exist or that if they do exist that it\u2019s our fault (and) that we somehow created the conditions of inequality,\u201d said Alicia Garza, who co-founded the Black Lives Matter Global Network with Patrisse Cullors and Opal Tometi. In the wake of Floyd\u2019s killing last summer, large crowds took to the streets in multiple cities in solidarity with Black Lives Matter. The protests were bigger and more sustained. The BLM signs that popped up in many people\u2019s yards were just the first signs of a nationwide racial reckoning. People marched against police violence, systemic racism, to be seen and heard. \u201cIf you don\u2019t speak up and don\u2019t say anything, you\u2019re just like the officers that stood by and watched,\u201d Randy Fikki, a protester in Kansas City, told CNN affiliate WDAF-TV, referring to the officers involved in Floyd\u2019s death. Critics have responded to the phrase \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d by coining their own slogans, such as \u201cAll Lives Matter,\u201d which some argue minimizes the current struggle Black people face against systemic racism, and \u201cBlue Lives Matter,\u201d referring to the lives of police. Last week, Trump supporters were criticized on social media after using another phrase that has been known as a racial justice call for years. They used the hashtag #SayHerName when referring to Ashli Babbitt, a 35-year-old White woman who was fatally shot as the mob tried to force its way toward the House floor. They appeared to be oblivious to the #SayHerName campaign, which aims to raise awareness of the Black women and girls who fall victim to police brutality \u2013 and who are often overlooked and forgotten. The campaign, launched in 2014 by the African American Policy Forum and Center for Intersectionality and Social Policy Studies, has worked to highlight the cases of dozens of Black women, including Atatiana Jefferson and Michelle Cusseaux, both killed by police in their homes.",

            "article_content": "Bryan Monroe, a journalism professor and former CNNPolitics.com editor who once headed the National Association of Black Journalists and helped guide the Biloxi Sun Herald to a Pulitzer Prize for coverage of Hurricane Katrina, has died. He was 55. Monroe died Wednesday morning of a heart attack at his home in Bethesda, Maryland, where he lived with family, according to Suzanne Malveaux, a longtime friend and CNN national correspondent. \u201cHe liked to connect people who were in different worlds \u2013 whether it was the media world, Hollywood, journalism, academia,\u201d Malveaux told CNN. \u201cHe loved to cook. He brought people to be at his house often \u2013 well, not this past year, unfortunately. And he loved to bake.\u201d In a long journalism career that included stints as vice president and editorial director at Ebony and Jet magazine and assistant vice president of news at Knight Ridder Newspapers, Monroe conducted the first post-election interview with former President Barack Obama. Sam Feist, CNN\u2019s Washington bureau chief and senior vice president, said he first met Monroe in 2008 after the Obama interview. \u201cIt was an extraordinary interview and was one of the reasons I told CNN\u2019s leadership that we should hire Bryan Monroe as our Political Editor,\u201d Feist said in an email. \u201cI\u2019ve never met someone who was as comfortable in any environment \u2013 whether with a group of politicians, students, Black journalists, or white journalists. Bryan navigated those worlds better than anybody and the bridges he built between people and between groups will be around a long long time.\u201d Monroe had the last major interview with pop legend Michael Jackson two years before the latter\u2019s death in 2009. \u201cSure, I was shocked when I heard the news that the King of Pop had left the world,\u201d Monroe wrote in June 2014. \u201cBut, in a way, I was not all that surprised. Jackson, even as troubled as he was, had given his all to the world during his 50 years on the planet. And now he was in the hands of history.\u201d Monroe was the Verizon Chair and professor at Temple University\u2019s Klein College of Media and Communication. Before Temple, he had been named editor of CNNPolitics.com, leading the editorial planning and content strategy for CNN\u2019s online and mobile political coverage from the DC Bureau. \u201cBryan often talked about the importance of \u2018connecting the dots\u2019 in journalism\u2026 the concept of bridging ideas and big picture themes,\u201d Meredith Artley, a senior vice president and editor-in-chief of CNN Digital Worldwide, said of Monroe. \u201cHe brought that to work and also to life. He was a connector of people within CNN and the industry at large. He was a magnet at any work or industry event, always surrounded by people and ready with a good story or an introduction. We were lucky to have him as a leader and thinker at CNN, and in the journalism community at large.\u201d \u201cBryan was a very social person and he loved to bring people together,\u201d Malveaux said. \u201cHe was really good at that. He was always at the big White House correspondents\u2019 events, the balls and the after parties. He was my partner in crime because I was too shy to approach people or introduce myself and he was like a social butterfly.\u201d Before becoming editor of CNNPolitics.com in 2011, Monroe was a visiting professor at Northwestern University\u2019s Medill School of Journalism. He served as president of the National Association of Black Journalists from 2005 to 2007. \u201cI am beyond heartbroken,\u201d NABJ President Dorothy Tucker tweeted Wednesday, adding that an official statement was to follow. \u201cBryan texted me a couple of days ago just to check in and ask if I needed anything. What I need now is to hear this is a dream. My condolences to his family.\u201d As assistant vice president of news at Knight Ridder, Monroe helped lead journalists at the Biloxi Sun Herald in Mississippi to the 2006 Pulitzer Prize Gold Medal for Public Service for coverage of Hurricane Katrina. Malveaux recalled speaking with Monroe on the phone on Tuesday, when they chatted about their families and excitement over the new year. During a tumultuous summer of racial reckoning in America after the death of George Floyd at the hands of Minneapolis police, Monroe lamented the toll the coronavirus pandemic and police violence on the Black community. \u201cIt has set in stark relief how little of this is within our control,\u201d he wrote in a CNN Opinion piece. \u201cWe, mostly, are not the cops on the street. We, mostly, are not the CEOs in the board rooms. We, mostly, aren\u2019t the voters electing the prosecutors and judges. We\u2019re not sitting at the dinner tables with the mildly racist cousins and uncles and in-laws who are snickered at or just tolerated. \u201cThis week has shown how much of what has been happening \u2013 and how many of the things that must change \u2013 are on the white majority. You have the real power. You are in the positions of authority. If this has really affected you at your core, you can actually change white culture. From the inside. We can\u2019t.\u201d A connoisseur of good food, Monroe was excited about starting life as a vegan about six weeks ago, according to Malveaux. \u201cHe was very happy about all these different recipes,\u201d she said. But it was socializing and entertaining and creating connections that impassioned him most, Malveaux said. \u201cHe was on a number of Zoom groups and calls where he was talking to R&B and hip hop artists and journalists and he was always excited about bringing guests to speak to his class,\u201d she said. \u201cHe was always about how can you be your best, and how can I help people connect to each other so they can encourage each other and support each other in being their best.\u201d Monroe was the founder and managing director of the Monroe Media Group, a Washington, DC-based media strategy, crisis communication and personal branding firm, according to LinkedIn. He was a Nieman Fellow at Harvard University. Monroe was born in Germany while his father was in the military. He is survived by his fiancee Abrielle (Abe), his daughter Seanna, son Jackson, a sister and his father.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: This story contains images and descriptions of extremist groups and their beliefs. Flags, signs and symbols of racist, white supremacist and extremist groups were displayed along with Trump 2020 banners and American flags at Wednesday\u2019s riot at the US Capitol. The pictures tell part of the story of the beliefs of some of those who chose to show up on that day \u2013 from passionate and peaceful Trump supporters to extremists who showed their hate with their symbols as well as their actions. The mixing of the groups is one issue that experts who track extremism and hate have long been concerned about. The certification of the election results proved to be exactly the type of event that brought together various groups and could have led to radical ideas being shared, they say. The initial event, which was heavily promoted and encouraged by President Trump, gave all of these groups something to rally around. \u201cThis was an event designed to oppose the results of a free and fair democratic election and the transition of power that would naturally follow,\u201d Mark Pitcavage, a historian and expert in extremism with the Anti-Defamation League said. CNN spoke with him to identify the symbols and understand the chilling messages of tyranny, white supremacy, anarchy, racism, anti-Semitism and hatred they portray. While a noose on its own is often used as a form of racial intimidation, Pitcavage says he believes in this context the gallows were to suggest punishment for committing treason. \u201cIt is suggesting that representatives and senators who vote to certify the election results, and possibly Vice President Pence, are committing treason and should be tried and hanged,\u201d he explains. That treason rhetoric was seen on right-wing message boards in days leading up to the event. The Three Percenters (also known as III%ers, 3%ers or Threepers) are part of the militia movement in the United States and are anti-government extremists, according to the ADL. Like others in the militia movement, Three Percenters view themselves as defending the American people against government tyranny. \u201cBecause many adherents to the militia movement strongly support President Trump, in recent years, Three Percenters have not been as active in opposing the federal government, directing their ire at other perceived foes, including leftists/antifa, Muslims and immigrants,\u201d according to the ADL. The group\u2019s name comes from an inaccurate claim that only three percent of the people in the colonies armed themselves and fought against the British during the Revolutionary War. The flag seen above is their logo on the traditional Betsy Ross flag. Pitcavage says right-wing groups (mainstream or extreme), which think of themselves as patriotic, sometimes co-opt America\u2019s first flag. \u201cRelease the Kraken\u201d flag The flag references former Trump lawyer Sidney Powell\u2019s comments that she was going to \u201crelease the Kraken.\u201d Powell falsely said she had evidence that would destroy the idea that Joe Biden won the presidency. The \u201cKraken,\u201d  a mammoth sea creature from Scandavian folklore, has turned into a meme in circles that believe the election was stolen. The Kraken, they say, is a cache of evidence that there was widespread fraud. On social media, QAnon conspiracy and fringe sites #ReleaseTheKraken has been widely shared along with false theories of fraud. The far right has co-opted the OK sign as a trolling gesture and, for some, as a symbol of white power. The ADL added that symbol to\u202fits long-standing database\u202fof slogans and symbols used by extremists. A photo from the riot at the US Capitol shows several people making the OK hand gesture. Some of the people in the photo are also seen in a livestream from the rally, where they identify themselves as members of the Proud Boys, specifically the Arizona chapter. The man livestreaming the event moves through the crowd at the Capitol saying \u201csupport your local Proud Boys.\u201d In the video, he goes up to a group wearing orange hats and says, \u201cThey wanna know what the orange hats stand for.\u201d One man replies that it\u2019s a way to keep their group together before another chimes in: \u201cIt stands for the best f*cking chapter in the best f*cking organization in the world.\u201d Asked what that organization is, the man in an orange hat declares: \u201cThe Proud Boys.\u201d The Proud Boys has been supportive of President Trump and present in large numbers at \u201cStop The Steal\u201d rallies in Washington, DC. The Proud Boys\u2019 leader, Henry Tarrio, who goes by Enrique Tarrio, was released from police custody Tuesday on\u202fcharges related to allegedly burning a Black Lives Matter banner taken from a Black church last month during protests in the city after a \u201cStop the Steal\u201d event. Tarrio has admitted to CNN he did burn the banner.  He was ordered by a local judge to stay out of DC as he awaits trial, including during this week\u2019s protests. The green, white and black flag was created by some members of the 4chan online community to represent a made-up joke country named for \u201cKek,\u201d  a fictional god they also created. It has long been present at right-wing and far-right rallies. \u201cThe Kekistan flag is controversial because its design was partially derived from a Nazi-era flag; this was apparently done on purpose as a joke,\u201d Pitcavage explained. \u201cYounger right-wingers coming from the 4chan subculture (both mainstream right and extreme right) often like to display the Kekistan flag at rallies and events.\u201d Altered Confederate and Gadsden flags were seen throughout the crowds at the Capitol.  One Confederate battle flag variation included an image of assault rifle and the slogan \u201cCome and take it\u201d to convey an anti-gun control message. The phrase \u201ccome and take it\u201d paraphrases the \u201ccome and take them\u201d retort uttered by Spartan King Leonidas at the Battle of Thermopylae when the Persian King Xerxes told him and his people to lay down their spears in return for their lives, Pitcavage said. The Gadsden flag, which is known to many as the \u201cDon\u2019t Tread on Me\u201d flag, is a traditional and historical patriotic flag dating to the American Revolution. The flag and symbol are also popular among Libertarians.  But it also has been co-opted by right wing groups. Pitcavage explains that while some fly it as a symbol for patriotism, others use it as a \u201csymbol of resistance to perceived tyranny.\u201d A man is seen wearing an Oath Keepers hat inside the Capitol after it was breached. The Oath Keepers is a pro-Trump, far-right, anti-government group that considers itself part of the militia movement charged to protect the country and defend the constitution. The group tries to recruit members from among active or retired military, first responders, or police. Their leader has spouted vast conspiracy theories on his blog, accused Democrats of stealing the election, previously threatened violence if it was necessary on Election Day during an interview with far-right conspiracist Alex Jones and said his group would be armed to protect the White House if necessary, according to the ADL. During the United States\u2019 long Civil War, no Confederate battle flag came within the shadow of the US Capitol, but on Wednesday, an insurrectionist carried one right through its halls. Photographers captured a man carrying it past the portraits of abolitionist Charles Sumner and\u202fslaveholder John Calhoun. The flag was always a symbol of support for slavery. After World War II, it became a prominent symbol of Jim Crow and segregation, Pitcavage says not surprisingly, it is a popular symbol among white supremacists \u2013 even outside the United States. A rioter cloaks himself in an America First flag with the logo of the podcast by far-right commentator Nick Fuentes. Fuentes attended the event at the Capitol, but was photographed remaining outside the Capitol building. \u201cAmerica First\u201d was also a slogan President Trump used in describing his foreign policy. Its adoption was criticized by the ADL, which said it had an anti-Semitic use seeking to keep the US out of World War II. The ADL says Fuentes is part of the \u201cgroyper army,\u201d which the ADL calls a white supremacist group. \u201cWhile the group and leadership\u2019s views align with those held by the white supremacist alt right, groypers attempt to normalize their ideology by aligning themselves with \u2018Christianity\u2019 and \u2018traditional\u2019 values ostensibly championed by the church, including marriage and family,\u201d the ADL explains. \u201cLike the alt right and other white supremacists, groypers believe they are working to defend against demographic and cultural changes that are destroying the \u2018true America\u2019 \u2013 a white, Christian nation.\u201d A rioter inside the Capitol wore a \u201cCamp Auschwitz\u201d sweatshirt. The bottom of the shirt reads \u201cWork brings freedom,\u201d which is the rough translation of the words \u201cArbeit\u202fmacht frei\u201d on the gates of the Nazi concentration camp. Auschwitz was the largest and most infamous Nazi concentration camp, where about 1.1 million people were killed during World War II. Pitcavage says he believes the shirt came from the now-defunct website Aryanwear. The design, which has been around for about 10 years according to Pitcavage, has been popping up on differing websites in recent weeks, though it is often taken down when a complaint is made. A social media image shows Nationalist Social Club stickers on what appears to be US Capitol Police equipment  It\u2019s unclear when the photo was taken, but it was posted Wednesday in a Telegram chat the group uses, which includes a Nazi symbol as part of their name. NSC, apparently a word play on the National Socialists or Nazi party, is a neo-Nazi group that has regional chapters in both the United States and across the globe, according to the ADL. It is unclear if the sticker on the right refers to a New England chapter, or because the group originally called itself the New England Nationalists Club. \u201cNSC members see themselves as soldiers at war with a hostile, Jewish-controlled system that is deliberately plotting the extinction of the white race,\u201d according to the ADL. \u201cTheir goal is to form an underground network of white men who are willing to fight against their perceived enemies through localized direct actions.\u201d There are still many questions about how exactly the attack on the Capitol happened and who led the charge. But the calls for overthrowing the government and for a civil or race war have long been rallying cries in far-right circles. The shirts worn by these men on the Capitol grounds on Wednesday show there was at least an intention to commemorate the day. They wore pre-printed shirts, referencing Trump\u2019s signature Make America Great Again slogan, alongside the words Civil war and the date of the event that turned into insurrection. Many commenters in far-right forums have written since the attack, that this is just the beginning of that civil war that many of them have long desired. Update note: This story has been updated with new CNN reporting on the men pictured in orange hats who say they are affiliated with the Proud boys.",

            "article_content": "Two Trump-appointed federal judges have rejected claims from January 6 defendants that they\u2019re being treated unfairly, because of their conservative politics, compared with left-leaning rioters in Portland, Oregon, in the summer of 2020. Judge Trevor McFadden on Tuesday became the second judge in two weeks to reject the comparisons, which are popular in right-wing circles, after his colleague in Washington, DC\u2019s, federal court Carl Nichols made a similar ruling last week. McFadden and Nichols both said the US Capitol riot defendants\u2019 arguments didn\u2019t have enough evidence to show discrimination. In one January 6 case, defendant David Lee Judd had asked McFadden to dig into Justice Department records about prosecution decisions in Portland and DC, claiming he was being treated unfairly compared with similar defendants on the West Coast. The Capitol rioters were overwhelmingly Trump supporters unhappy with the 2020 election result, while many of the left-leaning protesters in Portland said they were fighting against racial inequality and police brutality in the wake of George Floyd\u2019s murder. Judge rejects Proud Boys' First Amendment claims in January 6 conspiracy case McFadden refused Judd\u2019s request on Tuesday, explaining that the Portland riots didn\u2019t have the same severe consequences as the attempted coup on January 6. \u201cAlthough both Portland and January 6 rioters attacked federal buildings, the Portland defendants primarily attacked at night, meaning that they raged against a largely vacant courthouse,\u201d McFadden wrote. \u201cIn contrast, the January 6 rioters attacked the Capitol in broad daylight. And many entered it. \u2026 Their actions endangered hundreds of federal officials in the Capitol complex. Members of Congress cowered under chairs while staffers blockaded themselves in offices, fearing physical attacks from the rioters.\u201d Judd is charged in a nine-person indictment related to a three-hour battle inside one of the Capitol tunnels. Prosecutors say he threw a firecracker at police while they tried to hold back the mob. He pleaded not guilty. Nichols, weighing the case against another January 6 defendant, Garrett Miller, said on December 21 that the unrest in the two cities had \u201cobvious differences\u201d and the disruptions put hundreds of government officials at risk. \u201cThe Portland rioters\u2019 conduct, while obviously serious, did not target a proceeding prescribed by the Constitution and established to ensure a peaceful transition of power,\u201d Nichols wrote. \u201cNor did the Portland rioters, unlike those who assailed America\u2019s Capitol in 2021, make it past the buildings\u2019 outer defenses.\u201d January 6 panel stands down on request for some Trump documents after pushback from Biden administration McFadden did criticize the Justice Department for dropping cases against the rioters in Oregon \u2013 decisions that prosecutors made during both the Trump and Biden administrations, he noted \u2013 calling the moves \u201csuspicious.\u201d McFadden\u2019s sharp words for the Justice Department are likely to fuel right-wing criticism of the aggressive approach that law enforcement has taken toward hundreds of January 6 defendants, many of whom are now casting themselves as political martyrs. McFadden noted that the Justice Department ultimately dropped 27 cases against Portland rioters, including five that had charged felonies. \u201cRarely has the Government shown so little interest in vigorously prosecuting those who attack federal officers,\u201d he wrote, echoing a similar critique he had made this fall. \u201cEspecially during moments of politically charged unrest, the Justice Department must strive for even-handed justice. Judd raises troubling questions about the Department\u2019s adherence to this imperative in Portland.\u201d The Justice Department has also rejected these comparisons. Federal prosecutors have pointed out that many of the Capitol rioters bragged about their alleged crimes and posted photos online, while most of the rioters in Portland tried to obscure their identities by wearing masks and bandannas and rioting under the cover of darkness.",

            "article_content": "America\u2019s running political conversation defaults to the sitting president. Today, Joe Biden\u2019s legislative struggles, pandemic management and weak approval rating drown out most everything else. But in 2021, the performance of his partisan adversaries mattered at least as much to the nation\u2019s future. And in Washington and state capitals alike, Republicans have compiled a record of dishonesty and aggression that threatens American democracy itself. The January 6 insurrection, incited by then-President Donald Trump to overturn his election defeat, offered them a different path. Deadly violence that endangered their own lives gave Republican lawmakers the strongest possible justification for separating themselves from Trump\u2019s disfiguring pathologies. For a moment, they did. Shaken congressional leaders condemned him and returned to the vandalized capital to affirm Biden\u2019s victory. The moment passed. State legislators gear up to pass a 'tidal wave' of voting restrictions ahead of crucial 2022 midterms Those same Republican leaders later scuttled a proposed bipartisan investigation. GOP legislators in battleground states curbed voting procedures and changed election administration to help future losers succeed where Trump had failed in thwarting the popular will. \u201cUntil recently, when I got up in the morning it didn\u2019t occur to me that American democracy might be in the balance,\u201d observed Richard Haass, a high-ranking national security aide to two Republican administrations who has quit the GOP. \u201cIt\u2019s no longer a given. I don\u2019t think it\u2019s melodramatic to say this is the greatest crisis we\u2019ve faced since the 19th century.\u201d Narrowly, the crisis stems from Trump\u2019s 2016 rise on false promises to the minority of voters most aggrieved by the cultural and economic changes reshaping 21st-century America. But its roots extend back to the decades-old Republican strategy of harvesting support from conservative White opponents of the 1960s civil rights revolution. Those voters \u2013 disproportionately Southern, less educated, rural, evangelical \u2013 now represent the white-hot core of the Trump-era GOP. Analysis: There's nothing more frightening in America today than an angry White man \u201cWhen you think about the DNA of the current Republican Party being built around racial resentment, it\u2019s only one small step,\u201d said Robert P. Jones, an opinion analyst who\u2019s the CEO and founder of Public Religion Research Institute. \u201cThe very idea that some citizens ought to have a privileged place in the eyes of the law is, at its heart, anti-democratic.\u201d Unlike earlier Republican campaigns, Trump barely masked his race-based appeals. He consistently stoked anxiety over lost power and primacy among the shrinking ranks of White conservative Christians. \u201cHaving alienated college-educated suburban voters, many consequential Republicans decided their best bet is to keep their contracting coalition in a state of constant agitation and fear, combatants in a never-ending culture war,\u201d Peter Wehner, a former aide to President George W. Bush, wrote earlier this year. \u201cRight now, the Republican Party is a grave threat to American democracy.\u201d Trump has long expressed admiration for authoritarian strongmen. Fox News star Tucker Carlson in August staged his program in Hungary, the east European nation scholars call an exemplar of eroding democracy. Analysis: Why it's now 'American identity, stupid' in US politics \u201cThere are two key metrics: how do they deal with violence, and do they accept election results,\u201d said Harvard professor Daniel Ziblatt, co-author of the book \u201cHow Democracies Die.\u201d On both counts, Republicans have crept toward authoritarianism. Trump and elected allies turned to praising the January 6 mob and minimizing its lawless violence; some brandish guns on social media or in campaign ads. One congressman circulated a photoshopped anime video that appeared to depict the murder of a Democratic colleague. (He later said he doesn\u2019t \u201cespouse violence or harm towards any member of Congress\u201d and that the video \u201csymbolizes the battle for the soul of America.\u201d) In a recent Public Religion Research Institute survey, 30% of Republicans agreed that \u201ctrue American patriots may have to resort to violence in order to save our country.\u201d In a differently worded American Enterprise Institute poll question last January, 60% of White evangelical Christians agreed that \u201cThe traditional American way of life is disappearing so fast that we may have to use force to save it.\u201d Egged on by Trump, leading Republicans have made affirming or acquiescing in his big lie that the 2020 election was stolen from him a threshold qualification. In the 2022 GOP primary race for Georgia governor, ex-Sen. David Perdue distinguishes himself from incumbent Brian Kemp by saying he would not have certified Biden\u2019s 2020 Georgia win. Deteriorating political conditions for Democrats have positioned Republicans to win control of Congress next year without extra help. But having lost the popular vote in seven of the last eight presidential elections, they\u2019re not taking chances. Vilified by Trump, Liz Cheney explores her political future with backing from GOP elders A cadre of anti-Trump Republicans see glimpses of hope in their effort to change the party from within. Barbara Comstock, a former House member and congressional staffer, cites the Virginia gubernatorial victory in November of private-equity executive Glenn Youngkin, who accepted Trump\u2019s endorsement but eschewed his raw tactics. \u201cHas it been a discouraging year? Yes,\u201d Comstock allowed. \u201cBut I do feel new leaders will step up.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s important to wrench the party back to its senses,\u201d added Kori Schake, a former Bush aide who directs foreign policy studies at the American Enterprise Institute. \u201cI do think it\u2019s possible. I\u2019m still a Republican, standing squarely behind Liz Cheney.\u201d Invoking the Wyoming Republican congresswoman, daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney, only underscores the enormousness of the challenge. House Republicans ousted her as conference chair after she emphatically rejected Trump\u2019s election lies. She and Rep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois have become lone voices seeking to hold Trump and insurrectionist allies accountable and affirm America\u2019s 245-year-old democratic experiment. \u201cHow we address January 6 is the moral test of our generation,\u201d Cheney declared recently. In 2021, her party failed it.",

            "article_content": "A television attack ad from conservative Super PAC Club for Growth Action uses egregiously deceptive editing to build its case that Pat McCrory, a Republican candidate for a US Senate seat in North Carolina, is a \u201cTrump-hater\u201d and \u201cliberal faker.\u201d Facts First: The attack ad dishonestly sliced and diced remarks McCrory made on the Charlotte radio show he co-hosted after his term as North Carolina governor ended in 2017 \u2013 changing the meaning of some of his quotes to transform them into what sounded like direct attacks on former President Donald Trump and Trump supporters. As CNN reported in April, McCrory did make some comments on the radio show that were genuinely critical of Trump. But Club for Growth Action was not content to simply play these comments in the ad. Rather, the ad relied heavily on misrepresentations of other McCrory statements. Contrary to the ad\u2019s suggestion, McCrory\u2019s July 2020 comment urging Trump to \u201cget off the stage\u201d and \u201clet Joe Biden take over the number-one position\u201d was not an endorsement of Biden over Trump. Rather, McCrory actually said Trump could help himself win re-election, as McCrory said he wanted, by \u201coccasionally\u201d receding from the spotlight and letting Americans pay more attention to what McCrory said were Biden\u2019s poor public performances. Another part of the ad was also highly misleading: McCrory did not endorse the rioting that occurred during some of the racial justice protests in 2020 \u2013 he actually condemned that rioting \u2013 and did not issue a broad rebuke of Trump supporters. McCrory\u2019s \u201cwho in the hell do they think they are?\u201d remark featured in the ad was specifically about Capitol rioters who assaulted police officers. In addition, the ad highlighted a McCrory quote praising Mitt Romney, who is now a villain to many Trump supporters, while noting only in small type that McCrory uttered this quote during the 2012 election in which Romney was the Republican presidential nominee. Club for Growth Action, which is the political arm of the conservative organization Club for Growth, is backing one of McCrory\u2019s opponents in the Republican primary for the US Senate seat, Trump-endorsed Rep. Ted Budd. Club for Growth did not respond to a CNN request for comment on the ad\u2019s distortions. McCrory supported Trump\u2019s re-election in 2020 and has said he is a supporter of Trump\u2019s policy agenda. McCrory advisor Jordan Shaw said in an email to CNN this week that \u201cthese ads are bought and paid for by the DC swamp.\u201d The attack ad used a clip of McCrory saying the following words on his radio show on July 24, 2020: \u201cDonald Trump, get off the stage. Let Joe Biden take over the number-one position.\u201d This snippet made it sound like McCrory said he prefers Biden to Trump as president, the country\u2019s \u201cnumber-one position.\u201d But as Washington Post reporter Dave Weigel noted on Twitter on Wednesday, that\u2019s not what McCrory said. McCrory\u2019s comments came during a humorous \u201cMcCrory Top 5\u201d list of \u201cthe five current politicians that love celebrity and the stage a little too much.\u201d McCrory gave the number-two spot to Biden, whom he said has \u201calways loved the stage\u201d but was performing badly in the spotlight. McCrory then said the number-one spot was a tie between then-New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo and Trump. \u201cI hate to say it,\u201d McCrory said with a sigh, \u201cbut he\u2019s my president and I want him to be re-elected \u2013 but he\u2019s gotta get off the stage occasionally and let Joe Biden take over the number-one position if he wants to be president for a second term: Donald Trump.\u201d He then made a reference to Dr. Anthony Fauci\u2019s comically bad ceremonial first pitch at a baseball game that week: \u201cDonald Trump, do not go out throw out the first baseball next week, as I heard you say on Hannity. Don\u2019t do it! You have nothing to gain!\u201d McCrory was no doubt delivering some light ribbing of Trump here. But the attack ad made it appear as if McCrory had seriously declared that he favored Biden over Trump. That\u2019s not true. On his radio show on January 7, 2021, the day after a mob stormed the US Capitol, McCrory condemned both the Capitol rioters and violent participants in Black Lives Matter protests. But the attack ad deceptively chopped up McCrory\u2019s quotes, and framed them with misleading images, to make him seem like an anti-Republican hypocrite who supported violence at Black Lives Matter demonstrations while broadly condemning Trump supporters. He didn\u2019t do either of those things. The ad played McCrory\u2019s voice saying this: \u201cPeople rightfully protested for Black Lives Matter.\u201d The ad then flashed an image of a street fire, suggestive of a riot. The narrator said, \u201cBut Trump supporters?\u201d The ad then showed an image of Trump supporters holding signs that said \u201cPEACEFUL PROTESTER.\u201d Then the ad played McCrory\u2019s voice saying, \u201cRiots by Republicans. Who in the hell do they think they are?\u201d The edits and visuals in this section of the ad were thoroughly deceptive \u2013 twisting McCrory\u2019s comments beyond recognition. Here\u2019s what McCrory actually said. At length, he condemned violence by the \u201cradical left,\u201d by criminals in Charlotte and by violent participants in Black Lives Matter protests. He then said that, up until the \u201cdisgusting\u201d violence at the Capitol the day prior, he had been proud to say there had been \u201cno riots by Republicans.\u201d That \u201cno riots by Republicans\u201d line appears to be the source of the \u201criots by Republicans\u201d audio snippet in the ad. Later in the episode, McCrory denounced the Capitol rioters who had illegally entered the House of Representatives. He continued: \u201cAnd then to see police officers defending themselves and having to spray individuals who were attacking them. It\u2019s inexcusable. Who in the hell do they think they are, carrying an American flag and then assaulting a police officer?\u201d In both the ad\u2019s narration and its use of the \u201cPEACEFUL PROTESTER\u201d signs, Club for Growth Action depicted McCrory\u2019s \u201cwho in the hell do they think they are?\u201d line as a general attack on Trump supporters who had done nothing wrong. It omitted the McCrory words that would have made it clear he was, in reality, delivering a specific condemnation of the pro-Trump rioters who had attacked police officers. And that\u2019s not all. The ad also misleadingly truncated and illustrated McCrory\u2019s comment about Black Lives Matter. McCrory said he didn\u2019t think some of the January 6 rioters at the Capitol had originally planned to be violent; he said they \u201ccrossed the line with me\u201d even if they were \u201cfollowing the mob.\u201d Then he continued by once more criticizing violence during racial justice protests. \u201cWhen you follow the mob, you become part of the mob. I saw this during protests in Charlotte, where people rightfully protested for Black Lives Matter. But then they didn\u2019t stop others, people from breaking the windows. They didn\u2019t defend the police,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the exact same thing happened yesterday in Washington DC. People who had a right to protest did not protest the violence and the breaking of laws, of taking over a hallowed institutional building. It\u2019s inexcusable.\u201d In summary: the ad\u2019s visual of the street fire portrayed McCrory\u2019s \u201cpeople rightfully protested for Black Lives Matter\u201d snippet as an endorsement of rioting during racial justice protests. The ad did not inform viewers that McCrory explicitly and repeatedly condemned such rioting. The ad contrasted McCrory\u2019s criticism of Trump with a comment he made about Romney, whom McCrory called \u201ca man of incredible courage.\u201d But the ad was sneaky about when McCrory uttered this comment about Romney \u2013 making viewers locate small text at the bottom right of the screen to learn that the date of the quote was August 12, 2012. On that day more than nine years ago, Romney was not yet the Utah senator who has angered many Trump supporters with his votes to convict Trump on impeachment charges. Rather, Romney was the Republican nominee for president, running against Barack Obama, and he was campaigning in North Carolina with McCrory, who was then the Republican nominee for governor. Even in small and uncentered type, the disclosure of the date of the quote was more honest than much of the rest of the ad. Still, though, the ad could have been much more transparent on this point.",

            "article_content": "Of the 50-plus defendants who have been sentenced for their role in the January 6 attack on the US Capitol, fewer than half were sent to jail for their crimes. Most received an assortment of lesser penalties, including brief terms of house arrest, a couple years of probation, four-figure fines or court-ordered community service, according to a CNN analysis. The milestone of 50 sentencings was hit on Friday, a busy day in court, with six hearings on the schedule. Four defendants got probation Friday, including a pair of veterans from Wisconsin, while one man who stole a beer from House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s office got 20 days in jail. As federal prosecutors have brought cases against nearly 700 rioters, a heated debate has emerged over what justice should look like for such an unprecedented assault on democracy. This debate has raged on social media and in the halls of Congress. It has also played out among the two dozen judges handling the cases at the federal courthouse in Washington, DC. After 50 sentencings, a split has developed on the bench: One group of judges has handed down stiffer punishments to rioters, including time behind bars. While a more skeptical group of judges have rebuffed the Justice Department and instead imposed fines and probation, which means the rioters will avoid jail but stay under government supervision for years to come. This dynamic won\u2019t last forever \u2013 this initial wave of guilty pleas and sentencings will eventually be followed up by dozens of more serious felony cases with longer prison terms. But for now, the dizzying array of outcomes has caused some headaches. Judges are questioning the department\u2019s approach to January 6, and politicians from both sides have fanned the flames. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t look great that we\u2019re taking a bunch of people who stormed the United States Capitol and letting them go home. Not a lot of people are spending a lot of time in jail,\u201d said a Justice Department prosecutor with knowledge of the January 6 investigation who spoke to CNN on the condition of anonymity. \u201cBut jail isn\u2019t always the best outcome. A lot of them are getting significant terms of supervised release and probation, so they\u2019ve got to keep their nose clean.\u201d These wings of the court don\u2019t fall along political lines. There are GOP-appointed skeptics, and some Democratic appointees handing down tough punishments. But the dynamic is nuanced. This has also forced partisan players on both sides to contort their ideological views to fit the moment. Democratic lawmakers and activists are calling for more incarceration and want judges to throw the book at rioters, while many Republican officials and right-wing influencers have become newfound supporters of improving jail conditions for what they call \u201cpolitical prisoners.\u201d \u201cYou have this wild schism that is occurring in the public eye, with half the country saying these people were all violent and deserve to die in prison, and the other half saying they were simply exercising their rights to protest and to free speech,\u201d said Al Watkins, a defense attorney who represented the so-called \u201cQAnon shaman\u201d and a few other defendants charged in the riot. The nearly 700 cases are divided into two basic groups. The nonviolent rioters, who are only charged with misdemeanors. And then the felony cases, involving rioters who assaulted police, breached the Senate floor, destroyed property or conspired with far-right extremist groups. To help judges, prosecutors created a rubric of what should be considered at sentencing. This includes routine factors, like prior convictions or cooperation with investigators, as well as factors specific to January 6: Did the defendant enter the Capitol? How did they get in? How long were they inside? Did they incite or celebrate violence? Are they still justifying the attack? Federal prosecutors have allowed dozens of nonviolent rioters to plead guilty to a misdemeanor offense, which caps their potential jailtime at six months. Only 19 of the 50 misdemeanor cases ended with incarceration, according to CNN\u2019s latest tally. An additional four defendants were convicted of felonies, and they received sentences ranging from 8 months to 3.5 years in prison. Judges have collectively ordered these rioters to pay at least $70,000 in fines and restitution to the US government. That\u2019s a sliver of the $1.4 million in estimated damages to the Capitol, but for many of the blue-collar defendants, a fine of a few thousand dollars is a hefty financial hit. \u201cThe results so far are not surprising to me,\u201d said Ken White, a former federal prosecutor and current defense attorney who closely follows the January 6 cases. \u201cA lot of these are very minor crimes, so you expect the sentences to be very minor. It\u2019s somewhat unusual for someone to actually get jail time for a misdemeanor in the federal system. It\u2019s usually going to be probation.\u201d District Judge Tanya Chutkan has come to epitomize the court\u2019s more muscular wing. Four of her misdemeanor cases reached sentencing so far, and in all four cases, she went farther than the Justice Department\u2019s recommendation and sent rioters to jail, ranging from 14 to 45 days. An Obama appointee, Chutkan said at one sentencing that \u201cthe country is watching\u201d to see what happens to the Capitol rioters. Prosecutors requested three months of house arrest for Matthew Mazzocco, but Chutkan gave him 45 days in jail, saying, \u201cthere have to be consequences for participating in an attempted violent overthrow of the government, beyond sitting at home.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s remarkably unusual to have federal judges on the record calling out the DOJ for being too soft,\u201d CNN\u2019s senior legal analyst Elie Honig said. \u201cI\u2019ve been part of the opposite scenario, where judges say DOJ is being too aggressive, overcharging a case, or asking for an unreasonably high sentence. But to see judges say DOJ is coming in too low, that\u2019s unusual and noteworthy.\u201d The longest prison sentences so far have been reserved for felony offenders. The judges in these cases have generally agreed to the lengthy prison terms requested by prosecutors. \u201cThe offense that you committed is so in the heart of our democracy that I cannot justify a sentence below the guidelines,\u201d District Judge Royce Lamberth told Scott Fairlamb, who pleaded guilty to assaulting a police officer and obstructing the Electoral College proceedings. Lamberth, a Reagan appointee, sentenced Fairlamb to 41 months in prison, or about 3.5 years. That\u2019s the same punishment he gave to Jacob Chansley, the \u201cQAnon shaman\u201d who went viral for wearing a horned bearskin outfit while rummaging around the Senate floor. (Judges are randomly assigned to cases, and Lamberth happened to get these two prominent defendants.) In a misdemeanor case, Lambeth gave Frank Scavo two months in jail and a $5,000 fine, the legal maximum. Prosecutors sought only two weeks behind bars for Scavo, who organized busses to take 200 Trump supporters from eastern Pennsylvania to DC for the January 6 rally. \u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing on the felony level is troubling, and the trend is just starting,\u201d said Watkins, the lawyer who represented Chansley for most of this year. \u201cAnd I think the misdemeanor cases are getting a little more scrutiny than you\u2019d typically see. This event did not occur in a vacuum.\u201d Other judges on the DC District Court have a gentler approach. About 60% of the misdemeanor cases that have reached sentencing ended without jail for the rioters, according to CNN\u2019s tally. Many of these no-jail sentences came from two Trump-appointed judges, Trevor McFadden and Carl Nichols, though they were mostly in cases where prosecutors asked only for house arrest. For nonviolent rioter Danielle Doyle, prosecutors requested two months of house arrest and three years of probation. McFadden settled on a $3,000 fine and just two months of probation. \u201cI don\u2019t think the government\u2019s recommendation is appropriate,\u201d he said, before telling Doyle that January 6 was a \u201cstrange aberration\u201d for her, and that he hopes she\u2019ll \u201cuse your political passion and love for our country to protect and promote our country,\u201d and not to break the law. McFadden also slammed the Justice Department for not being \u201ceven-handed\u201d with the January 6 defendants, compared to the rioters involved in last year\u2019s racial unrest. He has imposed fines for three Capitol rioters, ignoring requests from prosecutors for short jail stints or house arrest. His first jail sentence came Friday, but with some caveats. Prosecutors wanted 60 days for Andrew Ericson, who stole a beer from a refrigerator in House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s office. McFadden gave him 16 days, and said he can serve on weekends, so he won\u2019t lose his jobs. The most influential skeptic on the court is Chief Judge Beryl Howell, who was appointed by former President Barack Obama and has forcefully condemned the Capitol rioters and what they stood for \u2013 but has repeatedly rebuffed prosecutors when they asked for incarceration. At a sentencing, Howell said the Justice Department was \u201calmost schizophrenic\u201d for stressing the dire consequences of the insurrection while letting rioters plead to a petty offense. She has also balked when prosecutors tried to use rioters\u2019 military service to seek tougher punishments. Most of these no-jail sentences contain significant terms of probation, often three years or longer. This means members of the January 6 mob will be under government supervision through the 2024 election, and will face harsher punishments if they break the law again. The Justice Department official who spoke to CNN on the condition of anonymity said probation would be an important tool to prevent political violence. Prosecutors can seek court-ordered limits on defendants associating with dangerous groups or accessing extremist content online. \u201cPeople are reacting to routine stuff as if it\u2019s horrific, and as if the judge must be crooked,\u201d White, the legal analyst, said about the probation-only sentences for January 6 defendants. \u201cThings that are routine in courtrooms have been spun to create outrage and clickbait.\u201d CNN\u2019s Holmes Lybrand contributed to this story",

            "article_content": "City Councilman Andre Dickens will become Atlanta\u2019s next mayor, CNN projects, defeating City Council President Felicia Moore in a runoff election to determine who will hold the city\u2019s top post. Dickens and Moore had advanced to the runoff after no candidate in a wide field received a majority of the vote earlier this month. The sitting mayor, Democrat Keisha Lance Bottoms, had announced in May she would not seek reelection. Leading up to Tuesday, polls suggested the contest was close with a large swath of the electorate still undecided. Dickens, a former businessman and nonprofit leader, has served on Atlanta\u2019s City Council since 2013. In a race that focused on a recent spike in violent crime as well as controversy over an effort by the residents of the wealthy community of Buckhead to break off from the capital and create their own city, Dickens \u2013 who previously served as the chair of the City Council\u2019s Public Safety Committee \u2013 laid out a public safety plan that prioritized community policing and boosting police resources. Dickens\u2019 proposal calls for increasing the police force by 250 officers during his first year in office while requiring new training for every police department employee on de-escalation techniques and racial sensitivity. Ahead of the November 2 general election, shooting incidents had increased dramatically from 406 at that point in 2019 to 629 this year, according to an October 23 report from the Atlanta Police Department. When Dickens takes office, he also faces concerns about low morale at the Atlanta Police Department and the number of officers who departed the force since June 2020. Tensions were high after Bottoms called for the firing of the officer who shot Rayshard Brooks in the parking lot of a Wendy\u2019s in June of 2020. Bottoms said she had asked the officer be let go from the force one day after the deadly shooting, the Atlanta Journal Constitution reported at the time. Though much of their rhetoric on the need for a safer Atlanta was similar, Dickens took a different approach than his opponent with regard to how he would handle policing in the city. While Moore suggested removing Police Chief Rodney Bryant from his position, Dickens said he would not immediately replace Bryant and instead would give Bryant 100 days to improve the department.",

            "article_content": "A version of this story appeared in CNN\u2019s What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here. Here\u2019s how politicians game the system: The same group of people can vote on the same Election Day with very different results. The gaming happens by drawing congressional and state legislative maps to politicians\u2019 advantage. Republicans have benefited more in recent elections, and they\u2019re off to a solid start this year as states draw new congressional district boundaries to account for the 2020 Census. Some estimates suggest Republicans at large will pick up the five seats needed for a House majority in 2022 simply by redrawing state congressional maps. I\u2019m going to spend more time looking at this issue in the newsletter since gerrymandering, along with restricting access to the ballot box, have emerged as the major challenges to the US form of democracy. I went to Sam Wang, a professor at Princeton University and director of the Princeton Gerrymandering Project, for more on what\u2019s happening right now and what it will mean for US politics in the coming years. Our conversation, conducted by email and edited for length, is below. WHAT MATTERS: Help people understand. If states like Texas and North Carolina have seen growth predominantly in urban areas and with minority communities, how can the maps be drawn to help Republicans? WANG: More and more in recent years, neighboring voters have similar opinions. Voters have also become more consistent in their political loyalty, independent of the candidate. That reliability makes it easy to predict how they will vote in the next election. To disempower Democratic-leaning voters in urban and minority areas, Republican legislators can split them down the middle so they can\u2019t win a race \u2013 or pack them into districts so they win very few races. Either way, it\u2019s possible to use Census and voting data to predetermine the partisan outcome. A Republican-favoring statewide map can be drawn by building lots of efficient Republican wins with 55%-60% of the vote. Then give Democrats very few wins with 65% or more of the vote \u2013 or split them up to stick them with Republican majorities. Using Texas as an example, the Houston and Dallas/Fort Worth areas have been cracked to split up Democratic voters as well as Black, Hispanic and Asian communities. Odd-shaped districts radiating out of the metro areas pair urban voters with rural majorities. This year, gerrymandering offenses are quickly exposed to the light of day, thanks to software, citizen engagement and expert organizations like the Princeton Gerrymandering Project. Casting a harsh light on the process can moderate some of the worst acts and document the offenses in real time. The resulting trail of evidence can help courts undo some of the most extreme maps. WHAT MATTERS: What\u2019s the inverse? How do Democrats draw their own friendly maps in places like Illinois? WANG: Note that even without gerrymandering, there is a basic cause of low competition in US politics: geographic clustering of voters, which makes it hard to draw competitive districts in most places. Redistricting could repair this, but legislators don\u2019t prioritize competition. Instead, they draw the lines to take away the ability of voters of either party to influence election outcomes. Relying on dependable voter habits and armed with mapping technology, both Republicans in Texas and Democrats in Illinois were able to eliminate competition in their new maps, both Congressional and legislative. Democrats have a slightly harder time gerrymandering, because rural and white voters are slightly less lopsided in their voting habits. But rural voters still can be put into districts that snake out from city centers. Or, they can be packed together in an artfully spread-out district. Such Democratic gerrymanders can have lots of county splits and unnatural boundaries. WHAT MATTERS: You give letter grades to states for their maps. Which states have the worst grades and why? WANG: We\u2019ve given out a number of F grades so far, including Congressional maps in Illinois, Ohio, North Carolina and Texas. A fifth gerrymander may occur in New York. That might be it for big-state extreme gerrymanders, since Florida\u2019s legislative and Congressional drafts look better than expected and a Virginia state court appears to be focused on meeting fair-districting criteria. The \u201cF\u201d states\u2019 legislatures \u2013 and it was always a legislature that got an F \u2013 put partisan control ahead of other aims such as competition, minority representation and keeping counties whole and districts compact. In all cases, the common factor was that one political party controlled both the legislature and the governorship. The exception was North Carolina, where the state constitution excluded the governor from the process. WHAT MATTERS: Republicans control more state legislatures and so they have more control over this process nationwide. Do you think they\u2019ll get the five seats they need for a House majority simply through redistricting? WANG: We may not find out in 2022, since midterm elections are usually bad for the President\u2019s party, and Congressional control is so closely divided. Even without gerrymandering, the effect may be dozens of seats. It may take until 2024 to get clarity where redistricting is the key deciding factor. In the meantime, here is what we do know: in 2021, combining the large states that have gotten F grades with single-seat shifts in Utah, Oregon, and Arkansas, we estimate a net shift of five seats to Republicans so far. We still have to see what will happen in Tennessee, Maryland, Missouri and New York, as well as other states. Is it enough by itself to matter in 2022? It\u2019s right on the edge. But don\u2019t forget the big picture: partisan gerrymandering was far worse in 2011, when Republicans got an immediate advantage of at least 15 seats. Since that time, commissions have taken the redistricting power away from legislatures in Michigan, Colorado and Virginia. Divided control in Wisconsin and Pennsylvania should make redistricting more fair. In most of these states, the law requires public input and consideration of communities of interest. One consolation is that even where legislators are in control, state legislative maps are sometimes gerrymandered a little less than congressional maps, perhaps because some state laws require counties and other structures to be preserved. These are mostly under the radar of national reporters, but they are very important for local governance. WHAT MATTERS: Numerous states have enacted changes to end gerrymandering. Do these nonpartisan commissions work? Is there a better way to solve the problem of gerrymandering? WANG: Redistricting outcomes tend to be better if the process is decided by independent commissions and courts, or on a bipartisan basis. Overall, there\u2019s been a lot of progress: commissions in Michigan, California, Colorado and Virginia, and divided government in Wisconsin and Pennsylvania. These add to reforms already in place in California, Arizona and other states. Finally, public pushback may have prevented worse outcomes in Arizona, where the commission received public suspicion beforehand but ended up doing fine. Continued pressure in Georgia and Florida will be important. A second way to address gerrymandering is to sue in court. Lawsuits will challenge maps on racial grounds in Texas and other states, and on partisan grounds in North Carolina and Ohio. North Carolina and Ohio state supreme courts may each have a slim majority to strike down excessively partisan maps, because of specific conservative-leaning justices who appear likely to adhere to nonpartisan ideals. However, lawsuits can take years to resolve. All of these solutions rely on state-by-state solutions, which are available in some but not all states. Addressing these problems on a national level requires passing the Freedom to Vote Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Act. Congressional action on these bills is currently blocked by the current version of the filibuster rule in the Senate.",

            "article_content": "North Carolina\u2019s GOP-controlled state legislature on Thursday approved the state\u2019s new congressional maps, which have boundaries likely to give Republicans an advantage there for the next decade. The state gained a 14th congressional seat after the 2020 census. Ten of the 14 seats will lean Republican, according to the non-partisan Princeton Gerrymandering Project. Republicans currently hold eight of 13 seats. In North Carolina, the legislature is responsible for redistricting, and it doesn\u2019t need approval from the governor for the maps to become law. That means Democratic Gov. Roy Cooper is unable to veto the maps. State House Rep. Destin Hall, one of the top Republicans involved in the redistricting process, said the legislature chose not to use partisan election data in drawing maps, calling the process \u201cthe most transparent process in state history.\u201d \u201cFor the first time ever, the legislature voluntarily decided not to use election data in crafting the maps. We focused only on traditional criteria like keeping counties and cities whole. North Carolinians can be proud of what has been the most transparent redistricting process in state history,\u201d Hall said in a news release. But the maps were immediately met with backlash from voting rights advocates, who claimed they were gerrymandered and a partisan power grab. \u201cNorth Carolinians made it clear at the start of the redistricting process that they wanted to end partisan gerrymandering. Instead of listening to the people, Republican legislators did the opposite today by passing maps that are heavily manipulated in favor of their party and that will deny real political power to the most populous and diverse areas of the state,\u201d said former US attorney general Eric Holder, who is now the chairman of the National Democratic Redistricting Committee. Other critics said the new maps are harmful to Black voters in the state. \u201cWe are troubled that these districts would especially hurt Black voters, harmfully split communities and undermine the freedom of North Carolinians to have a voice in choosing their representatives,\u201d said Bob Phillips, executive director of Common Cause North Carolina. State Senate Democrats had offered alternatives to the final maps, proposals that would have created six congressional districts each for Republicans and Democrats, and two competitive districts, but the proposals were shot down. \u201cI fully expect we will see lawsuits filed against the Republican General Assembly on the claims that they have engaged in both racial gerrymandering and partisan gerrymandering,\u201d state Sen. Jay Chaudhuri told CNN on Thursday. The legislature is already facing one lawsuit filed last week by a group of civil rights groups including the NAACP, over their redistricting process for drawing North Carolina\u2019s state House and Senate districts. The suit claims the process failed to to consider race during the initial stages of the map-making process in ways that could have devastating impacts on the representation of Black individuals in North Carolinia in violation of state and federal law. The Tar Heel State has a history of being sued over its congressional map. In 2017, and the US Supreme Court struck down the state\u2019s congressional district map for racial gerrymandering, forcing the legislature to redraw the map. North Carolina is the tenth state to complete the redistricting process. Thirty-four states have yet to approve congressional maps and six states have only one district. CNN\u2019s Ethan Cohen and Rachel Behrndt contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "In Tuesday\u2019s elections, Republican candidates surged in blue states, cities rejected major police reform and suburban voters showed their independence. The major takeaways? This is a more moderate and centrist country than activists on either the right or left let on, and Donald Trump fever may be breaking. The system is working. Here\u2019s one thing everybody can be happy about: The election results, for the most part, are not being questioned. That may have a lot to do with Republicans doing well. But the results should prove to them that Trump\u2019s voter fraud myth is in fact a myth. RELATED: Voters don\u2019t care about Donald Trump. They care about Joe Biden\u2019s unpopularity From there, things get more situational. Here\u2019s what Republicans and Democrats should take away from the results. Leave Trump behind. Maybe Republicans didn\u2019t need to change voting laws, as they have been doing in key states, attempting to drive down Democratic turnout. Maybe they just needed to drop Donald Trump, as Republican Glenn Youngkin did on his way to winning the governor\u2019s race in Virginia, defeating Democrat Terry McAuliffe. It wasn\u2019t a bomb-throwing wannabe strongman who won over voters in the blue state. It was a smiling rich guy in a zippered vest who toned down but did not abandon racial issues that appealed to Trump supporters and seized on notions of so-called \u201cparental choice\u201d that appealed to suburbanites. His other big issue was ending a tax on groceries. These are literally kitchen table issues. The moderate Republican running for governor in New Jersey, Jack Ciattarelli, achieved a more stunning swing against the progressive Democrat Phil Murphy, who only narrowly leads as votes trickle in. Ciattarelli rejected Trump\u2019s election conspiracy theories and encouraged Republicans to vote. Compare those results with the California recall election in September, when Republicans rallied around a fire-breathing candidate, Larry Elder, a talk radio host. They lost hard, handing a victory to Democratic Gov. Gavin Newsom. Primaries are a problem. Republicans in Virginia got Youngkin rather than a more Trump-friendly politician by doing an end-run around their own voters. They took power from the GOP base and selected Youngkin with a nontraditional process of delegates going to drive-in locations back in May. In Buffalo, four-term mayor Byron Brown lost the primary earlier this year to Democratic Socialist India Walton, so he mounted a write-in campaign \u2013 the politics equivalent of the Triple Lindy. He\u2019ll keep his job. The people who vote get to choose. Democracies don\u2019t reflect the will of the people; they reflect the will of the people who vote. It\u2019s a different set of people who show up in an off-off-year election like this one than in a general election, when the White House and Congress are up for grabs. It\u2019s an even smaller subset that take part in off-off-year primaries. RELATED: These are the people who made history on election night Base voters on the right and left are the kinds of voters who show up to primaries, and they\u2019re also often the ones who have the most extreme views, driving American politicians into partisan corners. Politicians need to listen to what people want. \u201cIt sounds old fashioned, but you go out, you talk to people, you construct a platform based on what they have to say,\u201d said the Republican strategist and CNN commentator Scott Jennings, who is no fan of Trump. He noted Tuesday that in recent years the GOP hasn\u2019t had a platform. \u201cThe platform was whatever Donald Trump woke up that day and was thinking about.\u201d Youngkin\u2019s campaign, however, was built around issues that people care about, said Jennings. That\u2019s the path to victory. \u201cThis campaign had a platform and schools, and crime and quality of life were the core of that platform.\u201d RELATED: Independent voters favor Youngkin as he clinches victory in Virginia, CNN exit poll shows Youngkin took critical race theory, something not currently taught in Virginia schools, and turned it into a potent campaign issue by making voters feel like schools, many of which physically closed during the pandemic, weren\u2019t doing their jobs. Never mind that he likely won\u2019t have the power to do much about it as governor. The slogan \u201cdefund the police\u201d has not aged well. Maybe Democrats need to think long and hard about how to package efforts to remake American policing, particularly in the suburbs. Given the pain and suffering uncovered over the past year, there\u2019s clearly a need for police reform. But finding the answer won\u2019t be easy. First ballot initiative to change policing in Minneapolis fails Even in Minneapolis, where the police killing of George Floyd kicked off a national protest movement, voters rejected a plan to end the city\u2019s police department. Jacob Frey, the mayor targeted for his refusal to radically change policing, cruised to re-election, according to unofficial results. Eric Adams, the new mayor in New York City, won\u2019t be a radical liberal; he is a former cop who pushes law and order alongside the need for accountability. Democrats may need to move on from Trump even as they seek accountability for his attempted coup in Congress. Voters are over it, clearly, since McAuliffe built his campaign around painting Youngkin as a mini-Trump rather than on issues like keeping Virginia schools open. Democrats will now pivot. You can sense the freak-out happening among Democrats. Their moderate members, already worried about the GOP\u2019s historical advantage in next year\u2019s midterm elections, will be even more nervous about the massive social spending bill being pushed by President Joe Biden on Capitol Hill. Conversely, if they don\u2019t pass a version of it, they\u2019ll have squandered a large portion of what\u2019s likely to be their only years clinging to complete power in Washington. They, too, could take the advice of Jennings and talk to voters about what they want rather than keep talking about Trump.",

            "article_content": "Republican and Democratic voters overwhelmingly supported their parties\u2019 candidates in the gubernatorial race between Democrat Terry McAuliffe and Republican Glenn Youngkin, according to the results of CNN\u2019s Virginia exit poll, with independents breaking in favor of Youngkin, who CNN projected would clinch the win. A similar partisan pattern held down ballot in key Virginia races, with CNN projecting Republican Winsome Sears as the next lieutenant governor of the state. Youngkin also carried male voters in this year\u2019s election by a roughly 12-point margin, White women without college degrees by almost 50 points and White evangelicals by about 78 points \u2013 all broader margins than then-President Donald Trump posted over Joe Biden among those demographics in the 2020 election and than Republican Ed Gillespie posted over his gubernatorial rival in 2017. The exit polling also suggests a slim advantage for Youngkin in the suburbs, an area that shifted toward Democrats during Trump\u2019s presidency. Republican Youngkin wins Virginia governor's race, CNN projects Voters\u2019 views of McAuliffe are slightly underwater, while their opinions of Youngkin are modestly more positive. More than 70% of voters \u2013 including similar shares of those backing each candidate \u2013 say they viewed their choice for governor as being more in support of their candidate than against his opponent. Virginia voters in this year\u2019s election hold negative views of both President Biden and Trump. Biden, who won comfortably in Virginia last year, now faces approval ratings significantly underwater in the state, with roughly 46% approving and the rest disapproving \u2013 likely a consequence both of his declining ratings since taking office, and the composition of the electorate that turned out to vote this year. Only about one-fifth of voters say they viewed their votes as a way to express support for Biden, with nearly 3 in 10 saying it was a way to express opposition and the remaining half of the electorate saying Biden wasn\u2019t a factor. Trump isn\u2019t any more popular in the state: Only about 4 in 10 view him favorably. McAuliffe, in the final days of campaigning, had crisscrossed the state, casting its elections as a chance for Democrats to validate their eight years of leadership in the commonwealth by delivering Republicans and the former President a defeat ahead of critical 2022 and 2024 elections. Youngkin, meanwhile, leaned into local issues like education and fashioned himself as a champion for parental rights. About one-third of Virginia voters called the economy the most important issue facing the state, placing it ahead of other topics that dominated headlines in the closing days of the race. Just under one-quarter said education is most important, another 15% chose taxes, about 14% chose the coronavirus pandemic and just under one-tenth chose abortion. McAuliffe voters call the economy their top issue, followed by the coronavirus and education. Among Youngkin voters, the economy is the top issue, followed by education and taxes. Most voters take a positive view of Virginia\u2019s economy, with about 55% rating it either excellent or good. About three-quarters of those with negative views of the economy backed Youngkin, with a slightly smaller share of those with positive views of the state\u2019s economy voting for McAuliffe. Voters were closely divided over which candidate they trusted to handle the economy: Roughly 39% trusted only McAuliffe and about 44% trusted only Youngkin, with the rest trusting both or neither. National debates over masking and Covid-19 vaccine mandates charged the Virginia governor contest, with Youngkin having tapped into frustration with remote schooling for months during Covid-19 to get a hearing for his more partisan messages on the rights of parents to decide how their children are taught about America\u2019s racial history. Although exit polling showed the pandemic isn\u2019t at the top of voters\u2019 concerns, they\u2019re overwhelmingly likely to be vaccinated and a smaller majority are supportive of workplace vaccine mandates. The vast majority of Virginia voters, more than 8 in 10, say they\u2019ve gotten at least one dose of a Covid-19 vaccine, and about 54% say they favor employers requiring their employees to get vaccinated. It's Election Day in several key states McAuliffe holds a commanding lead among voters who call the pandemic the biggest issue. The small minority of unvaccinated voters overwhelmingly support Youngkin, while McAuliffe holds a more modest majority among vaccinated voters. About 80% who back a workplace mandate favored McAuliffe, while nearly 9 in 10 of those who oppose it favored Youngkin. In his closing argument to voters ahead of Election Day, Youngkin sought to center the national implications of the race, in part, on education. Roughly half of Virginia voters say parents should have a lot of say in what their children\u2019s schools teach, with about a third saying parents should have some say and a little over 1 in 10 saying they should have little or no say. That sentiment is even more pronounced among parents with children under 18, more than 60% of whom say parents should have a lot of say. Nearly 6 in 10 Virginia voters say abortion should be legal in most or all circumstances. Around half say that monuments to Confederate leaders on government property should be left in place; in the 2017 election, 57% of Virginia voters said such monuments should be left in place. About half of voters say the Democratic Party is too liberal overall, while about 46% call the Republican Party too conservative. About two-thirds of Democratic voters say their party\u2019s ideology is about right, while about two-thirds of Republicans say the same of the GOP. Independents are less satisfied with either party, with just under one-quarter saying the Democratic Party is generally about right, and about one-third saying that of the GOP. More than 80% of voters say they\u2019re at least somewhat confident that votes in the state will be counted accurately, but slightly below half call themselves very confident. Democrats are roughly four times as likely as Republicans to say they\u2019re very confident about election accuracy. Virginia\u2019s electorate in the governor\u2019s race doesn\u2019t look the same as it has in recent elections, the results also suggest. Roughly 74% of the electorate is White, according to the exit poll, compared with about two-thirds in the 2017 governor\u2019s election and the 2020 presidential election. The electorate is also older than it was a year ago \u2013 only about one-tenth are under 30, compared with 20% in 2020. The Virginia CNN Exit Poll is a combination of in-person interviews with Election Day voters and telephone and online polls measuring the views of absentee by-mail and early voters. It was conducted by Edison Research on behalf of the National Election Pool. In-person interviews on Election Day were conducted at a random sample of 35 Virginia polling locations among 1,840 Election Day voters. The results also include 2,068 interviews with early and absentee voters conducted by phone, online or by text. Results for the full sample have a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points; it is larger for subgroups. This headline and story have been updated with additional developments Wednesday.

It\u2019s normal for the out-of-power party to gain momentum in off-year elections and gain seats in Congress in the midterms. It\u2019s very abnormal for that party to be led by a person who actively tried to engage in a coup and overturn the most recent election results. Tuesday marks the first test of American democracy since the insurrection. What\u2019s happening in Virginia? Most of you don\u2019t live in Virginia like me and many in the national political press and punditry. It\u2019s not the only race being decided in Tuesday\u2019s elections (see the full slate and live updates here!). But you\u2019ve already heard a lot about the Virginia governor\u2019s race, and if Republican Glenn Youngkin pulls off a victory in this state that seemed to be getting bluer every year, you\u2019re going to hear a lot more. Can a vote for a Republican be separated from Trump? As long as Donald Trump is the preeminent Republican claiming credit for GOP wins, it\u2019s hard to argue a win by Youngkin doesn\u2019t also give power to Trump. People of good faith can disagree. And yet it\u2019s equally important to note it\u2019s a state election based on state issues, and there are real policy differences between the parties on social issues, taxes and support or opposition to the social safety net. Trump\u2019s not on the ballot, so this vote shouldn\u2019t have anything to do with him. This is the conundrum for voters. Many Americans genuinely believe in smaller government but also genuinely dislike Trump\u2019s anti-democratic behavior. CNN\u2019s election coverage will be in full effect Tuesday night. Tune in! Here\u2019s more information on how to watch, including poll closing times around the country. CNN\u2019s Dan Merica has an in-depth look at what\u2019s going on in the Virginia race. The obvious narratives are set: Trump light vs. mini-Trump. No matter what happens, CNN\u2019s Stephen Collinson writes Youngkin has established a template for swing state Republicans to appeal to Trump voters while keeping Trump himself at arm\u2019s length, essentially signaling to the hardest-core Trump supporters while speaking to the suburban women who seem to decide elections. And no matter what happens to Democrats, it\u2019s clear McAuliffe\u2019s strategy of relentlessly painting Youngkin as a mini-Trump was not as effective as he might have hoped. Youngkin fed off frustration in Virginia suburbs with issues like banning critical race theory from schools, which he turned into a top issue. It\u2019s not exactly a subtle racial wedge and appeals in particular to the same kinds of White voters who support Trump. Youngkin\u2019s message of parental rights is one that Republicans have already adopted nationwide. Bonus: CNN\u2019s Chris Cillizza writes about an interview between some comedians and a Virginia voter who is completely motivated to vote by the  issue of teaching critical race theory in schools but also has no idea what critical race theory is. Trump benefits from a Youngkin win. There is something else to consider here, however: While Youngkin downplayed Trump and kept him out of the state, his potential victory does a lot for the comeback Trump is plotting \u2013 showing how much he has dominated the GOP. American voters often do contradictory things. The most recent Washington Post-Schar School Virginia poll showed a tied race in Virginia among likely voters and the slightest possible McAuliffe edge among registered voters. Pollsters pull a smaller subset of answers from all registered voter respondents to get that \u201clikely\u201d figure. Trump was not the motivating factor in this race. While most voters in the poll \u2013 71% \u2013 said Youngkin\u2019s ideas and policies are similar to Trump\u2019s, that may not be motivating their votes. The Post\u2019s poll asked likely voters how Trump\u2019s endorsement of Youngkin affected their vote. Most likely voters \u2013 53% \u2013 said it made no difference. More than a third \u2013 37% \u2013 said it made them less likely to support Youngkin. Just 9% said it made them more likely to support him. And the Virginia voters\u2019 views on issues are in a different place than Youngkin\u2019s. More than two-thirds of Virginians said they want abortion laws to either stay the same or be less restrictive. Youngkin does not support the most extreme abortion restrictions, but he does support tightening state laws. Youngkin opposes vaccine requirements, but most registered voters \u2013 61% \u2013 said they support requiring teachers and school employees to be vaccinated against Covid-19, although support has dropped; two-thirds supported vaccine requirements for teachers in September. We may not know the results on election night, according to CNN\u2019s Harry Enten, who notes that early in the country\u2019s history people didn\u2019t even vote on the same day. But the rise of vote by mail means the rise of multiday counting. Virginia will elect a woman of color as lieutenant governor for the first time. New Jersey is a solidly blue state but Phil Murphy could be the first Democratic governor to win reelection in 40 years. There are five mayoral races. Here\u2019s what to watch in Minneapolis, Boston, Atlanta, New York City and Buffalo. Voters in Minneapolis will decide the future of policing in that city. The question goes beyond defunding the police. Six states are voting on 24 statewide ballot initiatives that will affect Covid-19 restrictions, police reform, election procedures and gambling.",

            "article_content": "Whoever wins Virginia\u2019s tight gubernatorial race Tuesday, the commonwealth will offer a fascinating read on where the country\u2019s stormy politics stand a year after Joe Biden beat Donald Trump, and may point to what happens next. In the closing days of the race, both nominees in Virginia \u2013 as well as the current and former Presidents \u2013 have pointed to how the race has national significance and could set the tone for next year\u2019s midterm elections and beyond. \u201cThe entire nation is watching this \u2026 there\u2019s only two statewide elections this year, New Jersey and Virginia, and all eyes are on Virginia. The nation needs us to vote for them too,\u201d Republican Glenn Youngkin declared on his final day on the trail on Monday. Ironically, however, Youngkin has done all he can to keep the campaign local, stressing issues like schools and local taxes \u2013 to avoid getting sucked into the political maelstrom still raging around Trump. Here are the major 2021 races to watch Democrat Terry McAuliffe, who\u2019s vying for a second nonconsecutive term, is hoping that apathy among his party\u2019s voters after a somewhat erratic campaign will not dampen turnout in Democratic strongholds in the commuter belt outside Washington, DC. After anchoring his bid on trying to paint  Youngkin as a less profane version of Trump, he needs fear of the former President\u2019s possible return to motivate his voters. \u201cTrump has now endorsed him for the tenth time today,\u201d McAuliffe said after the former President issued a new statement backing his opponent on Monday. \u201cWhat does that tell you? The little MAGA people, not as excited as you thought.\u201d McAuliffe even went as far as to claim Monday night that Youngkin was \u201cdoing an event\u201d with the former President, although a Youngkin aide confirmed to CNN that the Republican candidate did not call into a tele-rally held by Trump on Monday evening. It can be dangerous to extrapolate too much about the nation\u2019s political destiny from a single race. And what happens on Tuesday will not define critical congressional elections in 2022 or the 2024 presidential duel. But Virginia and New Jersey are often seen as referendums on a new White House since they vote a year after the presidential election. They offer the first real health check on Biden\u2019s first year in office, after he\u2019s endured a brutal summer and has struggled to enact his massive social spending and infrastructure plans. A McAulliffe loss would be billed as a disaster for Democrats and a sign voters have already turned against them. And even a narrow victory in a state Biden won easily in 2020 would likely still be seen as a warning sign for Democrats and suggest their political position has seriously eroded after a year controlling the White House and both chambers of Congress. Why Republicans are poised for gains in 2022 regardless of who wins in Virginia on Tuesday Unusually, the previous presidency \u2013 with its racial overtimes and violent end \u2013 has also loomed over this Virginia campaign, testimony to Trump\u2019s still hugely divisive role in US politics. Bitter cultural and ideological clashes have rocked this campaign and are already beginning to shape the midterm races. Youngkin has leaned into a fierce backlash from conservatives to the push by progressives for transgender equality and an accounting of America\u2019s past racial sins in the teaching of history in schools. Scenes of furious parents at school board meetings in Virginia are being repeated nationwide, heralding a new flashpoint that could inject GOP campaigns with similar energy as the Tea Party movement did before midterms in 2010. And Virginia \u2013 with its wealthy, diverse suburbs and rural, conservative tracts, plus strongholds of African American voters around the state capital of Richmond and toward the coast \u2013 offers a demographic profile of America in miniature. Until then-Sen. Barack Obama won Virginia on the way to the White House in 2008, Virginia was considered a solid, conservative, southern state for presidential votes even while electing some Democrats statewide. But it has gone blue in the last four presidential elections, which is one reason why McAuliffe\u2019s struggles this year \u2013 after a successful term between 2014 and 2018 \u2013 are surprising. (Virginia does not allow governors to serve consecutive terms). Why Democrats are in a lot of trouble in Virginia But if there ever was a time for a Republican governor to win the state back, it may be now. An incumbent Democratic President has endured a miserable few months with his approval ratings dipping into the mid-to-low 40s. Trump was a huge motivating force for Democratic, independent and disillusioned moderate GOP voters in the state last year. But he\u2019s not on the ballot, despite McAuliffe\u2019s relentless efforts to paint Youngkin as a clone of the former President. The patience of voters has also been sorely tested by the pandemic, with cases spiking in the summer despite Biden declaring it all but over on July Fourth. The national cultural fights over masks and vaccine mandates electrified the gubernatorial race, while Youngkin tapped into existing frustration with remote schooling for months during Covid-19 to get a hearing for his more partisan messages on the rights of parents to decide how their children are taught about America\u2019s racial history. He also referred to several alleged assaults in schools in the city\u2019s pro-Democrat Loudoun County that triggered controversy over the rights of transgender students. McAuliffe had left the door wide open with an ill-advised comment in a debate earlier this year, when he said, \u201cI don\u2019t think parents should be telling schools what they should teach.\u201d Youngkin took the comment out of context, but in retrospect, that was the moment when his campaign really gained traction as he chased down his rival\u2019s polling lead in October and made the race a dead heat by Election Day. For all McAuliffe\u2019s claims that a victory for his foe would open the door to another Trump presidential campaign, the Republican former investment banker has done a skillful job of not being Trump. Framing his campaign on local issues, despite its national implications, and vowing to raise spending on education and nix the grocery tax, Youngkin has tried to appeal to suburban Virginians while sending coded messages to Trump voters that he needs to turn out in big numbers. Trump tells backers to 'get out and vote' for Youngkin in Virginia governor's race His vow to ban the teaching of Critical Race Theory \u2013 a preoccupation of conservative media \u2013 in Virginia schools gets the biggest cheers of his rallies, even though it\u2019s not part of the curriculum. But last week, McAuliffe accused him of trading in racial dog whistles after Youngkin ran an ad in which a parent, who turned out to be a conservative activist, complained about explicit content in a book her son was assigned to read. Unnamed in the ad, the book turned out to be \u201cBeloved,\u201d by the late Toni Morrison, a Nobel laureate and one of the country\u2019s most revered African American literary figures. Racial issues are never far below the surface in Virginia, the seat of the Confederacy and the site of a 2017 White supremacist march in Charlottesville, after which Trump equivocated on condemning racist protesters. Youngkin has not campaigned with Trump \u2013 whose low ratings in suburbs nationwide helped doom his party in the US House in 2018 and the Senate and White House in 2020. But the former President\u2019s statement backing Youngkin on Monday looked like an attempt to try to claim credit for his victory should he win. The towering, mild-mannered Youngkin comes across as a poor model for McAuliffe\u2019s Trump-fueled attack \u2013 a problem that Obama, one of the Democratic heavyweights imported to boost McAuliffe\u2019s campaign, took on during a rally last month. \u201cYou can\u2019t run ads telling me you are a regular old hoops-playing, dish-washing, fleece-wearing guy, but quietly cultivate support from those who seek to tear down our democracy,\u201d Obama said. Youngkin does not have to win suburbs in Arlington, Fairfax and Loudoun counties on Tuesday. He just has to do well enough, especially with independents, to limit McAuliffe\u2019s edge while driving out Trump\u2019s base voters downstate. If he wins, Youngkin will validate a possible template for future Republican candidates who want to broaden their appeal but also need to avoid alienating Trump\u2019s base. He has already demonstrated the potency of running a campaign focused on parents frustrated with public schools. And given the size of the task he faced, a Youngkin victory would crown a new star of the GOP \u2013 especially for those conservatives who envision a post-Trump future. A Youngkin victory would raise questions among Democrats about whether tying GOP candidates to the extremism and anti-democratic incitement of the ex-President is a viable strategy for 2022. And yet Trump \u2013 who appears to be using the midterms as a springboard for his own possible 2024 campaign and is backing candidates who promote his lie that the last election was stolen from him \u2013 is likely to be a ubiquitous and explosive presence next year who will be difficult for any downballot candidate to escape. But anything less than a clear victory for McAuliffe would posit that Democratic House seats in Virginia could be in grave danger next year if there is a similar turnout. Given House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s narrow majority, there would be panic among scores of Democrats about a possible GOP rout next year, which could possibly precipitate a wave of retirements from incumbents in threatened seats. A close race or a small McAuliffe victory will also be closely watched for new signs that Trump and his acolytes will seek to fuel their lies about a broken election system and allege voter fraud. Such claims would further damage faith in US democracy \u2013 already gutted among Trump supporters. But it would fuel the ex-President\u2019s personal political goals.",

            "article_content": "Donald Trump is acting like an ex-President with a constitutional crime to hide as the cover-up of his assault on democracy gathers pace alongside his political comeback. The twice-impeached 45th President\u2019s continuing influence on politics, popular culture and national life is broadening on multiple fronts and appears undimmed by his ban from social media platforms. His behavior is mirroring the conduct he showed in office: a driving desire to avoid accountability, a challenge to the US system of checks and balances, a willingness to exploit racial and cultural divides, and an eye for a political opening that could boost his own profile, like an apparent tele-rally on the eve of Virginia\u2019s gubernatorial election. The high-stakes election in a state Trump lost by 10 points last year will be closely watched as an indicator of the political environment heading into the 2022 midterms. A just-revealed list of documents that Trump wishes to prevent the House select committee probing January 6 from seeing \u2013 and over which President Joe Biden has refused to assert executive privilege \u2013 in itself offers a darkly suggestive picture of Trump\u2019s activities leading up to the mob attack by his supporters on the US Capitol. If the committee gets its hands on call logs, memos from senior White House staff and entries from the then-President\u2019s schedule, it will be able to create a much fuller picture than is already known about how far Trump directed events, the depth of his effort to steal the election from Biden and how little he did to stop the January 6 riot once it started. New January 6 court filings reveal what Trump is trying to keep secret from Congress \u201cIn 2021, for the first time since the Civil War, the Nation did not experience a peaceful transfer of power,\u201d the House Committee wrote. \u201cThe Select Committee has reasonably concluded that it needs the documents of the then-President who helped foment the breakdown in the rule of law. \u2026 It is difficult to imagine a more critical subject for Congressional investigation.\u201d While Trump perpetually tries to evade the consequences of his actions, his latest campaign of obstruction is closely linked with his increasing political activity heading into the midterm elections and a possible 2024 presidential campaign. If the committee were to produce a damning report of Trump\u2019s conduct, it would form a powerful public record of an attempt by an ex-President to destroy America\u2019s democratic heritage as he apparently seeks the office again. There is every reason to believe that in a new White House term, and feeling validated, Trump would pose an even greater threat to democratic governance. The lengths to which Trump is prepared to go to prevent Americans from learning the full truth about the Capitol insurrection came to light in late night court filings on Friday and early Saturday. The National Archives for the first time revealed details in a sworn declaration about the trove of documents Trump wants kept secret. Among the 700 pages of documents are handwritten memos from then White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, logs of calls by the then-President and then-Vice President Mike Pence and White House visitor records. Trump lawyer John Eastman said 'courage and the spine' would help Pence send election to the House in comments before January 6 In the Meadows documents alone, there are three handwritten notes about the events of January 6 and two pages listing briefings and telephone calls about the Electoral College certification, the archivist said. The papers could also shed new light on the role of conservative lawyer John Eastman, who drafted a six-step plan for how Pence could have certified the election in favor of Trump, rather than the rightful winner on January 6. Eastman proposed Pence throwing out the votes of enough states that Biden won so that the presidential election would be decided by the House, where each state gets a single vote and Republicans controlled more state delegations. Eastman said on former White House official Steve Bannon\u2019s radio show in January that Pence could pull it off if he had the \u201ccourage and the spine\u201d to do so, according to comments unearthed by CNN\u2019s KFile. CNN reported last week that the January 6 committee would subpoena Eastman if he did not cooperate. The conservative lawyer\u2019s blueprint, which has been derided by many scholars but appears to have been taken seriously by Trump, has prompted some members of the January 6 committee to draft new legislation to head off such schemes in the future. The proposal could offer more specific instructions for when Congress can overturn a state\u2019s slate of electors, and more clearly define the role the vice president plays in counting the votes, CNN\u2019s Jeremy Herb and Pamela Brown reported. Drafting a law would also provide the committee with a \u201clegislative purpose,\u201d that could potentially strengthen its case \u2013 both against Trump\u2019s sweeping executive privilege assertions and against Bannon, who has already been cited for criminal contempt of Congress for ignoring a subpoena and could be prosecuted by the Justice Department. The concept of executive privilege is meant to provide presidents a guarantee that they can receive confidential advice on matters of state from senior officials. However, Trump appears to be using the doctrine to cover-up details of his own role in trying to stage a coup, so the claim that he is seeking to protect the office of the presidency itself rings rather hollow. But even if the House select committee does draft legislation, its prospects are uncertain. It could potentially pass the Democratic-led House, but its chances of surviving a likely GOP filibuster in the Senate \u2013 where only seven Republican senators voted to convict Trump in his second impeachment trial over January 6 \u2013 appear slim. Such GOP appeasement of Trump\u2019s autocratic instincts was cited on Sunday by Illinois Rep. Adam Kinzinger \u2013 a rare Republican critic of Trump and one of just two Republicans on the January 6 committee \u2013 as one of the reasons why he decided not to run for reelection. Another one of the 'Trump 10' heads for the exits \u201cYou ultimately come to the realization that basically it\u2019s me, Liz Cheney, and a few others that are telling the truth, and they\u2019re about 190 people in the Republican Party that aren\u2019t going to say a word,\u201d Kinzinger said on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week.\u201d \u201cAnd there\u2019s a leader of the Republican caucus that is embracing Donald Trump with all he can,\u201d Kinzinger said, referring to House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, who has anchored his party\u2019s hopes of winning back the House next year and becoming speaker, on Trump. The latest developments in the January 6 investigation were not the weekend\u2019s only indicators of Trump\u2019s hold over his party and the influence his tumultuous time in the Oval Office still holds over the country. He is apparently planning to vault himself on Monday into the Virginia governor\u2019s race with a tele-rally on behalf of Republican candidate Glenn Youngkin, who has run a well-pitched campaign that all but ignores the ex-President while sending coded cultural and racial messages to his supporters. Youngkin hopes to make gains in the critical suburban areas around Washington, DC, where Trump is held in disdain. Trump\u2019s maneuver appears to be a naked attempt to claim credit if Youngkin wins a neck-and-neck race in a state where Biden trounced the ex-President. But it might just give Democratic candidate Terry McAuliffe \u2013 who has had limited success with painting his rival as a Trump clone \u2013 an election eve boost. \u201cTrump wants to win here so he can announce for president for 2024. That\u2019s the stakes of this election,\u201d McAuliffe told supporters on Sunday. If McAuliffe \u2013 who served a previous term as governor \u2013 squeezes out a victory Tuesday, it might suggest that Trump remains a drag on swing state GOP candidates, even out of office. But Trump is likely to use a victory for Youngkin to bolster his false claims that vote counts in last year\u2019s elections were tampered with and that he really won in states he easily lost. In a new sign that his return to front-line politics is accelerating, Trump showed up in Atlanta on Saturday night for Game 4 of the World Series and, with the former first lady by his side, relished taking part in the controversial \u201cTomahawk chop\u201d \u2013 a chant and gesture that is a longtime tradition at Braves games but has also been criticized as racist and offensive to Native Americans. Trump\u2019s visit, alongside his personally recruited Georgia senate candidate Herschel Walker, underscored his willingness to embrace politically incorrect causes to send cultural signals to his base \u2013 a technique that is at the center of his political appeal. His visit to the state also brought a reminder of some of his most notorious efforts to steal the 2020 election, including his January 2 call to Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, a Republican, who disclosed on Sunday that he felt threatened by Trump\u2019s pressure to find votes that would overturn his narrow loss in the state to Biden. \u201cAnd so you run down every single rabbit trail, none of it ever was supported by the facts. And so I was never concerned from the standpoint of that, but I heard the threat that he was making,\u201d Raffensperger said on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d Sunday. The ex-President\u2019s influence also hung over the G20 summit in Europe as foreign nations wonder how long Biden\u2019s \u201cAmerica is Back\u201d mantra will last if Trump runs for president in 2024. The current President on Sunday warned the world is \u201ccontinuing to suffer from the very bad decisions President Trump made to pull out of\u201d the Iran nuclear deal. Biden has struggled to get the Islamic Republic back to the negotiating table and the US now appears on the edge of another serious escalation with Tehran.",

            "article_content": "The political world eagerly awaits results from Tuesday\u2019s Virginia gubernatorial race, but they won\u2019t yield much new information about 2022 and beyond. Republican candidate Glenn Youngkin has run a strong race in a Democratic-trending state \u2013 which, if that translates into victory, would match Virginia\u2019s longstanding pattern of rewarding the party that lost the White House the year before. A Youngkin victory would be no surprise, though polls generally show a close race with Democratic opponent Terry McAuliffe. Republicans nationally are poised for gains in next year\u2019s midterm elections - reflecting the nation\u2019s longstanding pattern of rewarding the party that lost the White House two years before. So long as Americans remain uneasy about the pandemic, the economy, and President Joe Biden\u2019s leadership, Democrats stand to lose control of Congress whether or not McAuliffe manages to keep the Virginia governor\u2019s mansion in his party\u2019s hands. \u201cIf McAuliffe wins by one or loses by one, is the message going to be any different?\u201d asked Larry Sabato, who directs the University of Virginia Center on Politics. \u201cNo \u2013 it\u2019s going to be a tough midterm.\u201d One number that should worry every Democrat in Virginia The prospect of 2021 and 2022 elections following established trendlines says little in particular about Youngkin, McAuliffe, Virginia, congressional Democrats, or Biden. They simply represent new cast members in a familiar political play. The same tidal forces shape the odd-year and midterm contests following a race for the White House. As the nation\u2019s highest-profile public official, a new President quickly becomes the focus of prevailing public discontents. Biden\u2019s recent struggles have dragged his approval ratings underwater, nationally and in Virginia. Four years ago, then-President Donald Trump was in even worse political shape in the wake of his erratic behavior, racial provocations, and attempt to repeal the Affordable Care Act. Similar dynamics have produced victories for the party not occupying the White House in 10 of the last 11 Virginia gubernatorial elections. They\u2019ve produced US House seat gains for the party not occupying the White House in nine of the last 11 midterm contests. As early voting nears its end, McAuliffe and Youngkin campaign in decidedly different ways During that period, the pattern offered no clear guidance about the reelection prospects of the presidents involved. Four of them (Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama) won a second term; three (Jimmy Carter, George H.W. Bush and Trump) did not. Occasionally, Virginia and midterm results have diverged. That gives congressional Democrats reason to hope for shifting political winds over the next year even if Youngkin wins on Tuesday. In 1998, during Clinton\u2019s presidency, House Democrats gained seats despite the furor over his affair with Monica Lewinsky. In 2002, with the younger Bush in the White House, House Republicans did the same. Both results followed Virginia gubernatorial victories by the other party. McAuliffe knows the one-of-eleven Virginia exception well. It was his 2013 win for governor after Obama\u2019s 2012 reelection. That did not presage a strong 2014 Democratic midterm. Republicans went on to capture full control of Congress, allowing them to stymie Obama\u2019s legislative agenda for the balance of his term. To some degree, McAuliffe\u2019s 2013 victory reflected Virginia\u2019s long-term trend toward his party as the swelling ranks of moderate suburban voters gained clout at the expense of rural conservatives. After losing the state in 10 straight presidential elections beginning in 1968, Democrats have carried it in the last four. Biden beat Trump by 10 points there last year. That makes last week\u2019s Fox News poll \u2013 showing Youngkin ahead by 8 points among likely voters \u2013 all the more striking for its hint of a major partisan shift. Republican voters cut Youngkin some slack as he walks tightrope on Trump Yet an 18-point swing in election margins from presidential to gubernatorial contest would hardly be unprecedented. After Obama won Virginia by 6 points in 2008, Republican Bob McDonnell won the governorship by 17 points a year later. After Reagan won Virginia by 25 points in 1984, Democrat Gerald Baliles won the governorship by 10 the next year. Polling averages show the McAuliffe-Youngkin race neck-and-neck. As Biden struggles politically \u2013 a new NBC News poll measures his approval at just 42% nationally \u2013 Virginia Democratic strategists fear subpar enthusiasm among their supporters could tilt the race against them. It doesn\u2019t take much electoral acumen to know that if the President remains at 42% next November, national Democratic strategists will have good reason to fear the same thing. McAuliffe\u2019s fate on Tuesday won\u2019t change that. \u201cFrom a political analysis perspective, there\u2019s really not that much difference between a 50-49 win and a 49-50 loss,\u201d Sean Trende, the senior elections analyst for RealClearPolitics, tweeted last week. \u201cIt matters for power, but not really for getting a sense of the state of affairs.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Former President Donald Trump participated in the controversial \u201cTomahawk chop\u201d at Game 4 of the World Series in Atlanta on Saturday night. The chop, a stadium-wide chant and longtime tradition at Braves games, has been under renewed scrutiny as part of a national discussion about racism and racial imagery in professional sports. Several advocacy groups and observers have accused the chant of mocking Native American groups and decried it as racist. But many Braves fans, including Georgia Republican Gov. Brian Kemp, have dismissed the criticism, and the stadium has led the fans in doing the chant in both Games 3 and 4 of the series. Trump has frequently sought to capitalize politically on such controversies as part of an effort to galvanize the White voters who make up much of his political base. 'Dehumanizing' and 'racist.' Native leaders decry Braves' 'Tomahawk chop' ahead of World Series game in Atlanta Accompanying the former president and first lady Melania Trump was former NFL star Herschel Walker, who is running for a US Senate seat in Georgia. The former president\u2019s support of Walker, which came initially over reservations from much of the GOP establishment, has given the former running back a boost ahead of next year\u2019s primary. Republicans are hoping to unseat incumbent Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock in the general election. In a statement earlier Saturday, the former president said he was \u201clooking forward to being at the World Series in Atlanta,\u201d adding that he and Melania were \u201clooking forward to a wonderful evening watching two great teams!\u201d He thanked MLB commissioner Rob Manfred and New York Yankees\u2019 president Randy Levine for the invite. Atlanta Braves CEO Terry McGuirk told USA Today on Wednesday that Trump will not be sitting with team or MLB officials and that the Braves will give Trump his own suite. \u201cHe called MLB and wanted to come to the game,\u201d McGuirk told the paper. \u201cWe were very surprised. Of course, we said yes.\u201d CNN previously reported Wednesday that Trump was planning on attending Game 4, according to a person close to Trump who told CNN. The Braves won 2-0 in Game 3 on Friday, putting them at a 2-1 advantage over the Astros in the best-of-seven series. The former Republican president last year had called for a boycott of baseball after MLB decided in April to move its All-Star Game out of Atlanta in response to Georgia\u2019s restrictive voting laws. The last baseball game Trump attended was in 2019 at Nationals Park in Washington, DC, when the Nationals were hosting the Astros in Game 5. The crowd booed and broke into chants of \u201clock him up\u201d when Trump was shown on the park\u2019s video screen during a salute to veterans. His 2020 presidential campaign also made a seven-figure ad buy during the final game of the 2019 World Series. Trump attended several sporting events during his time as president and received much warmer receptions from the crowds at NASCAR\u2019s Daytona 500, college football games in deep red states of Alabama and Louisiana, and when he did the coin toss at the 119th annual Army-Navy game. Since leaving office, Trump attended a UFC fight card in July and provided commentary on a boxing match on September 11. CNN\u2019s Karl de Vries, Mike Warren and Jill Martin contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "The latest back-and-forth in the race to be Virginia\u2019s next governor is centered on the value of teaching a Toni Morrison novel in commonwealth schools, highlighting Republican Glenn Youngkin\u2019s attempt to make the culture wars around education the major issue of the race as Democratic nominee Terry McAuliffe accuses him of using a \u201cracist dog whistle.\u201d Youngkin released an ad on Monday that features Laura Murphy, a Fairfax County mother and conservative activist, who spearheaded a campaign against \u201cBeloved,\u201d the 1987 Pulitzer Prize-winning novel. The campaign began after Murphy claimed it gave her son, a high school senior at the time, nightmares. The ad fits into the Youngkin campaign\u2019s broader strategy of seeking to pit McAuliffe against parents. McAuliffe seized on the issue at his Tuesday night rally with President Joe Biden. \u201cThis is his closing message. Glenn Youngkin is promoting banning book by one of America\u2019s most prominent Black authors. Just the fact he is even discussing this brings shame here to the commonwealth of Virginia.\u201d The Democrat had earlier responded to the ad by accusing his GOP opponent of trying to \u201cdouble down on the same divisive culture wars that have fueled his campaign from the very beginning,\u201d charging the strategy with being \u201ca racist dog whistle\u201d that looked to \u201cto gin up support from the most extreme elements of his party.\u201d Youngkin, however, has been undeterred, and has continued to use parents\u2019 involvement in public education as the centerpiece of his stump speech in the final weeks of the campaign ahead of Tuesday\u2019s election. \u201cMy fellow Virginians, this is our moment. Right now,\u201d Youngkin told an audience in Henrico on Saturday, adding that \u201cMcAuliffe wants government to stand between parents and their children\u201d and that parents across the country are calling and texting him to \u201cstand up for our children too.\u201d \u201cBeloved\u201d is considered a seminal work of American fiction and centers on the story of Sethe, a former slave and a mother who kills her child to spare her from slavery. Morrison, whose work was recognized with a Nobel Prize for Literature among many other awards, writes of the horrors of slavery in \u201cBeloved,\u201d including rape and bestiality. The Youngkin ad has set off the latest back and forth between his campaign and McAuliffe in what is shaping up to be the most closely watched election of the year. Polls have the race as a dead heat and top Democrats, including Biden and former President Barack Obama, have rallied to support McAuliffe. This back-and-forth began after Youngkin jumped on McAuliffe saying at a debate last month that he was not going to \u201clet parents come into schools and actually take books out and make their own decision\u201d and that he didn\u2019t think \u201cparents should be telling schools what they should teach.\u201d The comments came during a discussion about the role that parents should have in determining curriculum. Since the comment, Youngkin has centered his campaign on the rights of parents, hoping to stir up anger at Democrats primarily in the suburbs, where voters fled Republicans in 2020. Democrats have also gone after Murphy in response to the ad, noting that she is not an unbiased parent and has long given to and advocated for conservative causes. Murphy began her fight against \u201cBeloved\u201d in 2013. Eventually, the effort reached the Republican-controlled Virginia General Assembly, which passed two iterations of a bill in 2016 and 2017 that would have given parents the right to stop their children from reading certain sexually explicit assignments. The bills were eventually vetoed by McAuliffe. Murphy\u2019s fight has turned her into a Republican activist. She and her husband have donated thousands to conservative campaigns and causes, including Donald Trump\u2019s 2020 presidential campaign. Youngkin\u2019s campaign noted that the state bills Murphy advocated for were bipartisan and had the support of some members of Virginia\u2019s Legislative Black Caucus. \u201cThe bipartisan bills McAuliffe vetoed would simply have notified parents of sexually explicit reading assignments and given them the choice of having their own child receive an alternative,\u201d the Youngkin campaign said in a statement. On a call on Tuesday, Louise Lucas, the president pro tempore of the Virginia Senate, said she would hope that the Democrats who backed the bills had \u201clearned the lesson over time\u201d and regret backing them now. Lucas also charged that Youngkin\u2019s push wants to \u201cturn us back to a time when the works and the progress of Black people will not be recognized.\u201d \u201cGlenn Youngkin\u2019s latest ad only further demonstrate his commitment to Trump\u2019s dangerous agenda,\u201d Richmond, Virginia, Mayor Levar Stoney said on the call. \u201cBlack Virginians know it when they see it and they know it when they hear it. To me, it is a racist dog whistle.\u201d On a competing call on Tuesday, Kay Cole James, former Fairfax County School Board member and president of the conservative Heritage Foundation, disputed the idea that the issue was \u201cracial.\u201d \u201cIt shows to me sheer desperation at this point in the campaign to try to paint this that way. Don\u2019t take your eye off the ball,\u201d she said. \u201cAfrican American parents want to be involved in their children\u2019s education just as much as anyone else.\u201d AC Cordoza, a Republican House of Delegates candidate in Hampton, Virginia, added: \u201cThis is absolutely ridiculous that Terry McAuliffe is attempting to frame this discussion around race and it has absolutely nothing to do with that.\u201d The parental grievances issue has become a focal point of Youngkin\u2019s campaign in the closing weeks of the race. After the debate, his campaign launched a \u201cParents Matter\u201d series of events, bringing out scores of people to rail against McAuliffe. Despite it not being taught in Virginia schools, the campaign has also focused on critical race theory, a concept that\u2019s been around for decades and that seeks to understand and address inequality and racism in the United States. Democrats have rejected these concerns, arguing they are nothing more than a political tactic to stoke grievance ahead of an election in order to turn out base Republican voters. \u201cI really get sick and tired of people like Glenn Youngkin and Donald Trump. They constantly are dividing people. They\u2019re constantly turning people against one another,\u201d McAuliffe said in an interview with CNN this month. \u201cAnd why are we doing this to our students?

            "article_content": "Texas Gov. Greg Abbott on Monday signed into law a new congressional map that is expected to bolster the GOP\u2019s majority in the quickly diversifying state. The maps were approved by the state legislature last week, under the once-a-decade redistricting process, days before Senate Republicans in Washington, DC, blocked yet another voting rights bill that would crack down on those kinds of gerrymanders. Legal challenges to the new map are likely now that Abbott, a Republican, has signed it. The new map would consolidate the power of White voters and eliminate political competition in the state\u2019s rapidly changing suburbs. The number of majority-White districts would increase, even though the growing Hispanic population is almost entirely responsible for Texas gaining two seats in the US House in the reapportionment process. Hispanics \u2013 who, like Whites, comprise about 40% of the state\u2019s population, the 2020 Census found \u2013 would make up a majority in just seven of the state\u2019s 38 congressional districts. That\u2019s down one from the previous decade\u2019s maps, despite the explosive growth of the Hispanic population in the state. White voters would make up a majority in 23 districts and eight districts would have no racial majority, according to data from the Texas Legislative Council, reported by The Texas Tribune and FiveThirtyEight. Republicans would be heavily favored to win at least 24 of the state\u2019s 38 districts in next year\u2019s midterm elections and could win one swing district as well, based on a FiveThirtyEight analysis of those new districts\u2019 results in 2020\u2019s presidential election and other recent elections. If Republicans won those 25 seats, they would hold 66% of the US House seats in a state where former President Donald Trump last year won just 52% of the vote. The maps were the result of the first regular round of redistricting to take place since the landmark 2013 US Supreme Court decision that effectively gutted the Voting Rights Act \u2013 a federal law that had required states with a history of discriminatory voting laws, including Texas, to get the federal government\u2019s pre-approval before changing voting laws and implementing new district maps. The state\u2019s previous set of congressional and state legislative maps, approved by lawmakers in 2013, were the subject of court fights into 2019 \u2013 and the most recent round\u2019s maps are also likely to face a number of legal challenges. The new maps also triggered another round of calls from Democratic state lawmakers and activists for Congress to step in. Those hopes, though, were stymied again Wednesday, as Republicans in the Senate successfully filibustered a bill known as the Freedom to Vote Act, which would overhaul how congressional districts are drawn, in addition to other changes such as requiring all states to offer early voting and allow everyone to cast mail-in ballots. It was the latest in a long line of voting rights bills blocked by Republicans on Capitol Hill. Amid opposition in their own party, Democrats \u2013 who narrowly control the 50-50 Senate because of the vice president\u2019s tie-breaking vote \u2013 have not moved to abolish the filibuster, which requires 60 votes for legislation to move forward. A new federal law is likely the only tool Democrats have to check state-level Republicans from drawing favorable maps and imposing new state-level restrictions on voting, which could potentially tilt the landscape of next year\u2019s midterm elections and future contests in the GOP\u2019s favor. Both parties have a history of drawing maps to improve their standing in Congress and protect incumbents, but Republicans have been much more successful at it in recent decades. Seven states have now completed the redistricting process, with 37 states yet to approve maps. Six states have only one congressional district. White House under pressure to act on voting rights, but it's not ready to blow up the filibuster \u201cThere is still time. These federal legislative proposals can still be of help. But the time is running out,\u201d said Valerie Street, the president of Our Vote Texas, a non-profit that advocates for voting rights and registration. State lawmakers shored up the seats of a host of Republican incumbents who saw their districts grow increasingly competitive at the end of the last decade. They did so by shifting more left-leaning voters into the districts of Democratic Reps. Lizzie Fletcher in the Houston suburbs and Colin Allred in the Dallas area, and creating a new 37th District near Austin where Democratic Rep. Lloyd Doggett, who currently represents the 35th District, will run. Texas lawmakers also added a new, Republican-friendly 38th District in the Houston suburbs, and Wesley Hunt \u2013 who lost to Fletcher in 2020 \u2013 has already entered the race for that new seat, with the support of House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy. The new maps, on the heels of the state\u2019s restrictive new voting law that experts say will disproportionately affect urban areas with more diverse and Democratic-leaning populations, lay bare the deep cost of Democrats\u2019 missed opportunities to seize any lever of power in Texas in recent elections, even as the state becomes increasingly competitive. The 2020 Census showed that the population of Whites and Hispanics in Texas is nearly even, and that nearly all of the growth in the state is a result of Hispanics. But the number of Hispanic-majority congressional districts would shrink from eight to seven under the new maps. \u201cThis map is still not reflective of the Texas population. It doesn\u2019t adequately show where we are, where we\u2019ve come, where the growth has happened over the past decade,\u201d Street said. One of those seven is the 15th District, currently represented by Democratic Rep. Vicente Gonzalez \u2013 who is shifting to seek reelection in the neighboring 34th District, currently represented by retiring Democratic Rep. Filemon Vela \u2013 leaving an open seat where Republicans hope to consolidate their gains with Hispanic voters in the 2020 election. During the redistricting process, Republican lawmakers insisted they were not using race as a driving factor in dividing up districts. Calling the maps \u201crace blind,\u201d state Sen. Joan Huffman, the Republican who led the chamber\u2019s redistricting process, said at one hearing, \u201cWe have not looked at any racial data as we drew these maps, and to this day I have not looked at any racial data.\u201d But those claims are disingenuous, others said, because Republicans who drew the maps ignored ways in which non-White communities\u2019 political might was weakened, and produced new districts that don\u2019t reflect the reality of a state in which there will soon be more Hispanics than Whites. Senate Republicans block Democrats' voting and elections bill \u201cThe fact that this gerrymander is achieved at the expense of people of color is not surprising,\u201d said Michael Li, the senior counsel for the Brennan Center\u2019s Democracy Program and a redistricting expert who once led a Texas donor alliance that focused on voter participating in disadvantaged communities there. He pointed to spots in the new congressional maps in which suburbs are carved into small slivers, with right-leaning districts incorporating some of those slivers as well as large rural areas. \u201cThey\u2019re doing to the suburbs now what they used to do to Austin or big cities. That tells you where Republicans are \u2013 that they really need to use the rural areas to neutralize the suburbs,\u201d Li said. \u201cIn a lot of ways, it\u2019s a replay of the battles that have been going on for the last couple of decades, since Republicans gained control of redistricting. The one variant is White voters in the suburbs.\u201d The Texas maps were roundly condemned by state and national Democrats who have loudly criticized GOP lawmakers in Texas over their actions this year in implementing heavily partisan congressional maps and enacting a restrictive new voting law, but have no power to stop those actions. \u201cTexas Republicans have proven time after time that they don\u2019t want to risk fair elections. They know they are out of touch with the majority in the Lone Star State, and instead of adjusting their policies and politics for their constituents, they\u2019re trying to manipulate the structures of our democracy to artificially hold onto power,\u201d said Eric Holder, the former US attorney general who helms the National Democratic Redistricting Committee. \u201cCongress must do its part and pass the Freedom to Vote Act to put power back in the hands of the citizens of Texas and the American people \u2013 where it belongs,\u201d Holder said in a statement.

            "article_content": "The House Judiciary Committee, known for its combativeness, had the opportunity Thursday to question Attorney General Merrick Garland for the first time since he took his perch atop the Justice Department. Republicans repeatedly battered Garland with sensational claims that the department was treating parents like \u201cdomestic terrorists\u201d with a recent memo outlining steps DOJ was taking to address threats of violence against local school officials. Democrats defended Garland from those and other GOP critiques, but had a few matters they sought to grill Garland about as well \u2013 including the department\u2019s approach to civil rights issues and its handling of a defamation case against former President Donald Trump. Here are the takeaways from Thursday\u2019s hearing: One of the most scrutinized decision that Garland will face as attorney general was about to fall in his lap as the hearing was unfolding, with the House also moving towards approving criminal contempt resolution against Steve Bannon. That move puts before Garland a decision on whether to prosecute the adviser to former President Donald Trump for his refusal to cooperate in the House\u2019s January 6 insurrection investigation. Chairman Jerry Nadler referenced that referral and others the DOJ may be receiving from the House\u2019s Capitol insurrection investigation in an early question for Garland. House votes to hold Trump ally Steve Bannon in criminal contempt for defying subpoena \u201cThe Department of Justice will do what it always does in such circumstances, we\u2019ll apply the facts and the law and make a decision, consistent with the principles of prosecution,\u201d the attorney general said. Garland received praise from several Democrats about the department\u2019s broader criminal investigation into the Capitol breach, though they also questioned him about the pace of those prosecutions. Garland said that the time the prosecutions have taken \u201cis really not long at all,\u201d given the challenges of tracking down the defendants, the amount of discovery in the cases, and the way the pandemic affects court room operations. The school board memo dominated Republicans\u2019 questions. It directed the FBI to convene meetings with state and local officials, and to work on opening lines of communications for reporting threats. The top Republican on the committee, Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan equated the DOJ\u2019s approach to creating a \u201csnitch line on parents,\u201d while several Republicans suggested that parents were being viewed as \u201cdomestic terrorists.\u201d On several occasions, Garland pushed back at the claims, telling the committee that \u201cwe are not investigating peaceful protest or parent involvement at school board meetings.\u201d \u201cWe are only concerned about violence, threats of violence against school administrators, teachers, staff, people like your mother a teacher, that is what we\u2019re worried about,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are worried about that across the board. We\u2019re worried about threats against members of Congress. We\u2019re worried about threats against police.\u201d While he fielded Democratic support for the school board memo, Garland did catch a pointed question about how the department is handling a defamation case against Trump. Under Garland, the Justice Department is continuing to argue that Trump, in the case, should be treated as a government official acting in his official capacity, rather than a private defendant. Garland defended the department\u2019s handling of the litigation when it was raised by Rep. Steve Cohen, a Democrat from Tennessee. \u201cSometimes being the attorney general and sometimes being the judge, that means taking positions with respect to the law that are required by the law, but which you would not take as a private citizen,\u201d Garland said. \u201cIn this circumstance, the Justice Department\u2019s briefing is not about whether this was defamation or it wasn\u2019t defamation, it was solely on the question on the application of the Tort Claims Act.\u201d Democrats also grilled Garland on several civil rights matters, including police misconduct and violence in prisons \u2013 which have both been priorities under the current DOJ leadership. Perhaps the sharpest line of questioning on this front came from Missouri Rep. Cori Bush, who pressed Garland on racial discrimination in policing and on the department\u2019s recently announced review of DOJ police grants. Garland punted on a request by Georgia Rep. Hank Johnson that the department brief lawmakers on the results of an investigation announced last month into Georgia\u2019s prison system, which is an expansion of an Obama-era investigation that has not yet yielded public results. \u201cI\u2019m not sure what additional material can be provided outside of what we provide in court, but we\u2019ll look into it for you,\u201d Garland said. 'Big, big shifts': How Biden's civil rights pros have reoriented the Justice Department California Rep. Karen Bass brought up a letter sent to the department by the family of Tamir Rice,12-year-old Black child who was fatally shot by a Cleveland police officer, seeking that the DOJ reopen the inquiry into his killing. Garland, noting department protocol, would not say how the department was responding to the letter. Garland was also unable to answer Bass\u2019 question \u2013 which referenced the 2019 death of Elijah McClain, who died after being injected with ketamine during a police stop \u2013 about whether DOJ has a policy banning chemical restraints during arrest or detention. \u201cI\u2019m not familiar with that specifically, the Deputy Attorney General is doing a review of all of our use of force policies,\u201d Garland said, while pointing to the recently announced DOJ limits on chokeholds. Democrats repeatedly asked Garland about the departments actions to protect voting rights, with New York Rep. Mondaire Jones noting the department has sued only one state \u2013 Georgia \u2013 among several that have passed restrictive election laws this year. Garland noted how \u201clabor intensive\u201d these investigations are, particularly after the Supreme Court gutted a key part of the Voting Rights Act. Garland told Rep. Scott Fitzgerald that the investigation by special counsel John Durham \u2013 who was made a special counsel by Attorney General William Barr in the final weeks oft he Trump administration \u2013 was \u201ccontinuing,\u201d but the attorney general wouldn\u2019t say what Durham was investigating. John Durham outlines grand jury investigation into former Clinton campaign lawyer Garland pointed to the budget that had been publicly approved to fund the Durham probe, telling the Wisconsin Republican that he could draw from that that the work hadn\u2019t ended. \u201cI don\u2019t want to say what it\u2019s about,\u201d Garland said when asked whether investigation was continuing into the Clinton Foundation. \u201cThat\u2019s up to Mr. Durham. I\u2019m not determining what he\u2019s investigating.\u201d ",

            "article_content": "Attorney General Merrick Garland \u2013 whose nomination was premised on insulating the Justice Department from politics \u2013 faces a decision that puts him at the center of a partisan firestorm, with the House\u2019s request that the department pursue criminal contempt against Steve Bannon for his refusal to cooperate in lawmakers\u2019 insurrection probe. It\u2019s a political hot potato that is perhaps unprecedented in US history: How to proceed against an ally of a former President who is accused of dodging a congressional committee investigating an insurrection. The House approved Thursday a contempt resolution against Bannon in a 229-202 vote, which will put in front of the department a decision on whether to move forward with a criminal prosecution. Garland, a former judge on the influential federal DC appeals court, has been hailed by President Joe Biden as \u201cone the most respected jurists of our time.\u201d 'Big, big shifts': How Biden's civil rights pros have reoriented the Justice Department Garland pledged against partisanship at his confirmation hearing, telling senators: \u201cI am not the President\u2019s lawyer, I am the United States\u2019 lawyer.\u201d His tenure atop the department has already attracted skepticism from the left. Those critics have been frustrated by the lack of public indications of Justice Department investigation into former President Donald Trump himself for the Capitol riot, as well as other seemingly Trump-friendly decisions like its effort to try shielding Trump from an unrelated defamation case. At a hearing Thursday with the House Judiciary Committee, Garland was asked about the Justice Department\u2019s approach to the Bannon referral and any other referral put forward by the House\u2019s January 6 probe.\u201cThe Department of Justice will do what it always does in such circumstances, we\u2019ll apply the facts and the law and make a decision, consistent with the principles of prosecution,\u201d Garland said. Already, the matter has put Garland in an uncomfortable position, after Biden, when asked Friday whether witnesses should be prosecuted for not cooperating with the committee, said, \u201cI do.\u201d The Department responded with a strikingly forceful statement that said that it makes \u201cits own independent decisions in all prosecutions based solely on the facts and the law. Period. Full stop.\u201d That didn\u2019t stop Bannon from taking a swipe. Hurry up and wait: Trump's best legal shot at blocking the release of his January 6 docs \u201cThe Justice Department\u2019s trying to unwind and walk back Joe Biden\u2019s massive mistake,\u201d Bannon said on his podcast, referring to the comment about the non-cooperative witnesses. \u201cHe says, \u2018No, the all oughta be put in jail, they all oughta be criminal contempt,\u2019 everything like that. That\u2019s not the way it works, Joe.\u201d Bannon last week blew off a subpoena for private testimony from the House select committee investigating the Capitol attack. His fierce resistance to testifying or turning over requested documents has set him apart, according to lawmakers, from other witnesses whose cooperation the committee has sought. His lawyer has said his participation in the probe will not come until a court weighs in on Trump\u2019s ability to assert executive privilege in the investigation. The committee has pushed back on those legal arguments, noting that Bannon was not a government official during the period lawmakers are investigating, while touting January 5 comments Bannon made on his podcast predicting \u201call hell is going to break loose tomorrow.\u201d \u201cBased on the Committee\u2019s investigation, it appears that Mr. Bannon had substantial advance knowledge of the plans for January 6th and likely had an important role in formulating those plans,\u201d Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney \u2013 a Trump critic and one of two Republicans on the committee \u2013 said Tuesday. Judge who's criticized Capitol insurrection to hear Trump's challenge to House subpoena of presidential records Trump allies in Congress have embraced Bannon\u2019s legal arguments for not cooperating, as they accuse the select committee of going after witnesses for engaging in constitutionally-protected political speech. \u201c(Committee Chairman Bennie Thompson) knows there are willing hands at the Department of Justice ready to receive such a referral and to criminalize our politics\u201d Rep. Matt Gaetz said Wednesday at a hearing to consider the contempt vote. Gaetz, a Florida Republican, is among the top promoters of Trump\u2019s election fraud lies whose phone records the committee has indicated interest in investigating. Garland has insisted that, in the federal prosecutions of the more than 600 alleged participants of the mob, prosecutors are \u201cmaking determinations in every case about what charge fits the offense, what charge fits the law.\u201d His comments, at a New Yorker event earlier this month, came after one judge overseeing the cases suggested that prosecutors are going too easy on defendants. Another judge said the department lacked \u201ccredibility\u201d because it had not sought to prosecute as aggressively violence associated with 2020 racial justice protests as aggressively as it had with the Capitol riot. \u201cI am quite aware that there are people who are criticizing us for not prosecuting sufficiently, and others who are complaining that we are prosecuting too harshly,\u201d Garland said. \u201cThis is, you know, part of the territory for any prosecutor in any case.\u201d In a statement Tuesday, the DC US Attorney\u2019s office said that it would evaluate any contempt referral sent to it by the House \u201cbased on the facts and the law.\u201d Even before his confirmation to the department, Garland was well acquainted with the political firestorms that tend to erupt from the Hill. Trump sues to keep White House records secret, claiming executive privilege His 2016 nomination by President Barack Obama to the Supreme Court seat vacated after Justice Antonin Scalia\u2019s death was met with a several months-long blockade by Senate Republicans that left the seat open for Trump to fill. In the face of plans already made clear by Republicans to stall his nomination, Garland said at the time that \u201ctrust that justice will be done in our courts without prejudice or partisanship is what, in a large part, distinguishes this country from others.\u201d Garland\u2019s self-proclaimed rejection of partisanship is now on close examination as his department weighs the Bannon referral. \u201cThe one thing you can be sure of is Merrick Garland is not going to make a decision based on political calculations whatsoever,\u201d Seth Waxman, a former solicitor general and longtime colleague of Garland\u2019s, told CNN.

            "article_content": "Colin Powell, the first Black US secretary of state whose leadership in several Republican administrations helped shape American foreign policy in the last years of the 20th century and the early years of the 21st, has died from complications from Covid-19, his family said on Facebook. He was 84. \u201cGeneral Colin L. Powell, former U.S. Secretary of State and Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, passed away this morning due to complications from Covid 19,\u201d the Powell family wrote on Facebook, noting he was fully vaccinated. Powell had multiple myeloma, a cancer of plasma cells that suppresses the body\u2019s immune response, as well as Parkinson\u2019s, Peggy Cifrino, Powell\u2019s longtime chief of staff, confirmed to CNN. Even if fully vaccinated against Covid-19, those who are immunocompromised are at greater risk from the virus. \u201cWe have lost a remarkable and loving husband, father, grandfather and a great American,\u201d the family said. Powell was a distinguished and trailblazing professional soldier whose career took him from combat duty in Vietnam to becoming the first Black national security adviser during the end of Ronald Reagan\u2019s presidency and the youngest and first African American chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff under President George H.W. Bush. His national popularity soared in the aftermath of the US-led coalition victory during the Gulf War, and for a time in the mid-90s, he was considered a leading contender to become the first Black President of the United States. But his reputation would be forever stained when, as George W. Bush\u2019s first secretary of state, he pushed faulty intelligence before the United Nations to advocate for the Iraq War, which he would later call a \u201cblot\u201d on his record. Bush said in a statement Monday that Powell was \u201ca great public servant\u201d who was \u201csuch a favorite of Presidents that he earned the Presidential Medal of Freedom \u2013 twice. He was highly respected at home and abroad. And most important, Colin was a family man and a friend.\u201d Though Powell never mounted a White House bid, when he was sworn in as Bush\u2019s secretary of state in 2001, he became the highest-ranking Black public official to date in the country, standing fourth in the presidential line of succession. \u201cI think it shows to the world what is possible in this country,\u201d Powell said of his history-making nomination during his Senate confirmation hearing. \u201cIt shows to the world that: Follow our model, and over a period of time from our beginning, if you believe in the values that espouse, you can see things as miraculous as me sitting before you to receive your approval.\u201d The Point: The Colin Powell Republican no longer exists in the Republican Party Later in his public life, Powell would grow disillusioned with the Republican Party\u2019s rightward lurch and would use his political capital to help elect Democrats to the White House, most notably Barack Obama, the first Black president whom Powell endorsed in the final weeks of the 2008 campaign. The announcement was seen as a significant boost for Obama\u2019s candidacy due to Powell\u2019s widespread popular appeal and stature as one of the most prominent and successful Black Americans in public life. Powell is survived by his wife, Alma Vivian (Johnson) Powell, whom he married in 1962, as well as three children. Alma Powell, who is fully vaccinated against the virus, also tested positive for Covid-19 this month, but only exhibited mild symptoms, a source close to the family told CNN. She was sent home after treatment at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center. People we've lost in 2021 Cifrino told CNN Powell was vaccinated early on and received his second shot in February. He was scheduled to get his booster shot this past week but that was when he fell ill so he wasn\u2019t able to receive it. Covid-19 vaccines are a highly effective tool in preventing severe disease and death, but no vaccine is 100% effective. More than 7,000 breakthrough cases of Covid-19 that have resulted in death have been reported to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention through October 12. By that time, more than 187 million people in the US were fully vaccinated. That\u2019s one out of every 26,000 fully vaccinated people who has died of Covid-19, or 0.004%. Of those breakthrough cases resulting in death, 85% were among people age 65 and older and 57% were among men, according to the CDC. CDC data also show that the risk of dying from Covid-19 is more than 11 times higher for unvaccinated adults than it is for vaccinated adults throughout August. Among seniors, who are more susceptible to severe Covid-19, that gap is smaller. Among those 80 and older, the risk of dying from Covid-19 in August was about five times higher among unvaccinated people than among fully vaccinated people. Powell\u2019s death was met with an outpouring of grief from former and current leaders, including President Joe Biden who described Powell a \u201cdear friend\u201d and a dedicated public servant who broke barriers. \u201cColin embodied the highest ideals of both warrior and diplomat. He was committed to our nation\u2019s strength and security above all. Having fought in wars, he understood better than anyone that military might alone was not enough to maintain our peace and prosperity. From his front-seat view of history, advising presidents and shaping our nation\u2019s policies, Colin led with his personal commitment to the democratic values that make our country strong. Time and again, he put country before self, before party, before all else \u2013 in uniform and out \u2013 and it earned him the universal respect of the American people,\u201d Biden said. Former Vice President Dick Cheney, who served alongside Powell under Bush said he was \u201cdeeply saddened to learn that America has lost a leader and statesman. General Powell had a remarkably distinguished career, and I was fortunate to work with him,\u201d Cheney said in a statement, adding that Powell was a \u201ctrailblazer and role model.\u201d Former Secretary of State Madeleine Albright, Powell\u2019s predecessor at the department, remembered him on Monday as \u201ca wise and principled man, a loyal friend, and one of the kindest people I have ever met.\u201d \u201cAlthough we grew up in different contexts, we bonded over our family\u2019s immigrant stories, our deep love of America, and our belief in the importance of public service,\u201d she said in a statement. Condoleezza Rice, who succeeded Powell at State following his retirement in 2005, said on Monday that he \u201cwas a trusted colleague and a dear friend through some very challenging times,\u201d adding in her own statement that \u201cmuch of his legacy will live on in the countless number of young lives he touched.\u201d Colin Powell's life in pictures And Antony Blinken, the current officeholder, said Monday that Powell \u201cgave the State Department the very best of his leadership, his experience, his patriotism.\u201d Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin said in remarks on Monday that in Powell he \u201clost a tremendous personal friend and mentor.\u201d \u201cHe always made time for me and I could always go to him with tough issues. He always had great counsel. We will certainly miss him,\u201d said Austin, who himself made history earlier this year as the first Black Defense secretary. Colin Luther Powell was born April 5, 1937, in Harlem, New York, to Jamaican immigrants. After growing up in the South Bronx, Powell attended school at the City College of New York, where he participated in ROTC, leading the precision drill team and attaining the top rank offered by the corps, cadet colonel. \u201cI liked the structure and the discipline of the military,\u201d Powell said, according to a CNN profile of him in the early 2000s. \u201cI felt somewhat distinctive wearing a uniform. I hadn\u2019t been distinctive in much else.\u201d The Colin Powell Republican no longer exists in the Republican Party He entered the US Army after graduating in 1958, and later served two tours in South Vietnam during the 1960s, where he was wounded twice, including during a helicopter crash in which he rescued two soldiers. He stayed in the Army after returning home, attending the National War College and rising in leadership. He was promoted to brigadier general in 1979, appointed as Reagan\u2019s final national security adviser in 1987 and was tapped by the elder Bush in 1989 to head the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Powell\u2019s tenure in the elder Bush\u2019s administration was marked by his involvement in some of the most notable American military actions of the late 20th century, including the 1989 Panama operation, the 1991 Gulf War and the US humanitarian intervention in Somalia, though he retired from the Army days before the disastrous Battle of Mogadishu. Although Powell was initially reluctant to commit US troops when Iraq invaded Kuwait in 1990, he became one of the administration\u2019s most trusted spokesmen when the assault on Saddam Hussein\u2019s army finally came. \u201cFirst we\u2019re going to cut it off. Then we\u2019re going to kill it,\u201d Powell famously said at a news conference at the time, referring to the Iraqi army. Following the assault, Powell became something of a national hero, enjoying a 71% favorability rating in the first few years after the war. His efforts during the war also earned him two prominent awards: a Congressional Gold Medal in March 1991 \u201cin recognition of his exemplary performance in planning and coordinating\u201d the US response to Iraq\u2019s invasion, and a Presidential Medal of Freedom. As the elder Bush presented Powell with the award at a White House ceremony in 1991, he said the general\u2019s \u201cdeep compassion for every one of the thousands of men and women under (his) command will always be remembered.\u201d During Powell\u2019s time in the military, which lasted until 1993, he also received a number of other notable awards, including the Bronze Star and two Purple Hearts. He received his fourth star in 1989, becoming the second African American to rise to that rank. In addition to the military awards, Powell also received the President\u2019s Citizens Medal, the Secretary of State Distinguished Service Medal, and the Secretary of Energy Distinguished Service Medal, as well as a second Presidential Medal of Freedom, awarded with distinction, from President Bill Clinton. With a prominent national profile, Powell was floated as a potential presidential candidate in the 1996 election. But in a highly anticipated decision, he declined to participate in the race, citing a lack of \u201cpassion\u201d for electoral politics. \u201cSuch a life requires a calling that I do not yet hear,\u201d he told reporters in 1995. \u201cAnd for me to pretend otherwise would not be honest to myself, it would not be honest to the American people.\u201d Powell was again encouraged to run in the 2000 presidential election, but rebuffed calls for him to mount a bid. He instead endorsed George W. Bush, delivering a speech at the Republican National Convention in which he argued that the then-governor of Texas would \u201chelp bridge our racial divides.\u201d He was Bush\u2019s first Cabinet selection when he was announced as the 43rd President\u2019s nomination for secretary of state, and with his expertise in foreign policy and widespread popularity, he was unanimously confirmed by the Senate. He shared Bush\u2019s reluctance to project military strength across the globe, a view that was quickly displaced by the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. As Bush\u2019s top diplomat, he was tasked with building international support for the War on Terror, including the Afghanistan War, but it was his involvement in the administration\u2019s push for intervention in Iraq, over the concerns of many of America\u2019s longtime allies, for which his tenure at State would become best known. In February 2003, Powell delivered a speech before the United Nations in which he presented evidence that the US intelligence community said proved Iraq had misled inspectors and hid weapons of mass destruction. \u201cThere can be no doubt,\u201d Powell warned, \u201cthat Saddam Hussein has biological weapons and the capability to rapidly produce more, many more.\u201d Inspectors, however, later found no such weaponry in Iraq, and two years after Powell\u2019s UN speech, a government report said the intelligence community was \u201cdead wrong\u201d in its assessments of Iraq\u2019s weapons of mass destruction capabilities before the US invasion. But the damage was already done \u2013 to both Iraq, which the US went to war with just six weeks after Powell\u2019s speech, and to the reputation of the once highly popular statesman, who was reportedly told by Cheney before the UN speech: \u201cYou\u2019ve got high poll ratings; you can afford to lose a few points.\u201d Powell, who left the State Department in early 2005 after submitting his resignation to Bush the previous year, later called his UN speech a \u201cblot\u201d that will forever be on his record. \u201cI regret it now because the information was wrong \u2013 of course I do,\u201d he told CNN\u2019s Larry King in 2010. \u201cBut I will always be seen as the one who made the case before the international community.\u201d \u201cI swayed public opinion, there\u2019s no question about it,\u201d he added, referring to how influential his speech was on public support for the invasion. In his 2012 memoir, \u201cIt Worked for Me,\u201d Powell again acknowledged the speech, writing that his account of it in the book would likely be the last he publicly made. \u201cI am mad mostly at myself for not having smelled the problem. My instincts failed me,\u201d he wrote, referring to the report he used that contained faulty evidence of supposed Iraqi WMDs. \u201cIt was by no means my first, but it was one of my most momentous failures, the one with the widest-ranging impact.\u201d \u201cThe event will earn a prominent paragraph in my obituary,\u201d Powell wrote. After leaving the Bush administration, Powell returned to private life. He joined the renowned venture capital firm Kleiner Perkins in 2005, where he worked as a strategic adviser until his death. For a time, he gave speeches at \u201cGet Motivated!\u201d business seminars, and he authored the 2012 memoir. Though the large majority of Powell\u2019s time as a public servant was spent in Republican administrations, the later years of his life saw him supporting Democratic presidential candidates and harshly criticizing top Republican leaders. By 2008, the longtime Republican\u2019s coveted presidential endorsement went to another party when he announced his support for Obama\u2019s White House bid. At the time, he touted Obama\u2019s \u201cability to inspire\u201d and the \u201cinclusive nature of his campaign,\u201d while criticizing attacks on the Illinois senator by Republican presidential nominee John McCain\u2019s campaign as \u201cinappropriate.\u201d He was later named an honorary co-chair of Obama\u2019s inauguration and endorsed him again in 2012. What Colin Powell's surprise endorsement of Barack Obama revealed about his view of America's future Powell went on to vote for Hillary Clinton in 2016 over Donald Trump, whom he had strongly condemned as a \u201cnational disgrace and an international pariah.\u201d In an extraordinary move that year, three presidential electors in Washington state cast votes for Powell rather than Clinton, resulting in state fines that were later upheld by the Supreme Court. He again snubbed Trump in 2020 during the President\u2019s second campaign, announcing his support for Joe Biden in June of that year while blasting Trump\u2019s presidency. \u201cWe have a Constitution. And we have to follow that Constitution. And the President has drifted away from it,\u201d he told CNN, adding that he \u201ccertainly cannot in any way support President Trump this year.\u201d The retired general later delivered an address in support of Biden during the Democratic National Convention. And after Trump incited a deadly insurrection at the US Capitol in early January 2021, Powell told CNN that he no longer considered himself a Republican, with the longtime grandee of the GOP saying he was now simply watching events unfold in a country he long served. \u201cI can no longer call myself a fellow Republican. I\u2019m not a fellow of anything right now,\u201d he told CNN\u2019s Fareed Zakaria on \u201cGPS.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m just a citizen who has voted Republican, voted Democrat throughout my entire career. And right now, I\u2019m just watching my country and not concerned with parties.\u201d This story has been updated with additional information.

            "article_content": "President Joe Biden on Monday mourned the loss of Colin Powell, describing him as a \u201cdear friend\u201d and a dedicated public servant who broke barriers as the first Black US secretary of state. \u201cColin Powell was a good man,\u201d Biden said in a statement. \u201cHe will be remembered as one of our great Americans.\u201d \u201cColin embodied the highest ideals of both warrior and diplomat. He was committed to our nation\u2019s strength and security above all. Having fought in wars, he understood better than anyone that military might alone was not enough to maintain our peace and prosperity,\u201d Biden said. The President continued: \u201cFrom his front-seat view of history, advising presidents and shaping our nation\u2019s policies, Colin led with his personal commitment to the democratic values that make our country strong. Time and again, he put country before self, before party, before all else \u2013 in uniform and out \u2013 and it earned him the universal respect of the American people.\u201d Powell\u2019s leadership in several Republican administrations helped shape American foreign policy in the last years of the 20th century and the early years of the 21st. His family announced on Facebook that he had died from complications from Covid-19 at the age of 84. A source familiar with the matter said Powell had multiple myeloma, a cancer of plasma cells that suppresses the body\u2019s immune response. Even if fully vaccinated against Covid-19, those who are immunocompromised are at greater risk from the virus. Biden noted that when he was a senator, he worked closely with Powell when he served in Republican administrations as national security adviser, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff and as secretary of state. \u201cOver our many years working together \u2013 even in disagreement \u2013 Colin was always someone who gave you his best and treated you with respect,\u201d Biden said. Biden noted Powell broke racial barriers, \u201cblazing a trail for others to follow.\u201d He said Powell was committed to investing in the next generation of leadership and that his leadership \u201calways included a focus on future.\u201d \u201cAbove all, Colin was my friend,\u201d Biden said. \u201cEasy to share a laugh with. A trusted confidant in good and hard times.\u201d Biden continued: \u201cHe could drive his Corvette Stingray like nobody\u2019s business \u2013 something I learned firsthand on the race track when I was Vice President.\u201d Biden and Powell appeared on an episode of \u201cJay Leno\u2019s Garage\u201d in 2016 and raced each other in Corvettes. The President said he is \u201cforever grateful\u201d for Powell\u2019s support for his presidential candidacy \u201cand for our shared battle for the soul of the nation.\u201d \u201cI will miss being able to call on his wisdom in the future,\u201d Biden said. Powell endorsed Biden in the 2020 presidential election and recorded a video that played at the Democratic National Convention in which he attempted to appeal to more centrist voters. The 2020 election was the fourth straight presidential election in which Powell backed the Democratic presidential nominee over the Republican. He supported Barack Obama in 2008 and 2012, and he endorsed Hillary Clinton in 2016. Biden ordered flags to be flown at half-staff until sunset on October 22 to honor Powell\u2019s life and service to the nation. Vice President Kamala Harris described Powell as an \u201cindependent thinker and a barrier breaker who inspired leaders in our military and throughout our nation.\u201d Harris said she last saw Powell in July at a dinner honoring German Chancellor Angela Merkel. \u201cI was reminded then how he always showed the world the best of who we are. He upheld the highest standards, representing our nation with dignity, grace, and strength,\u201d Harris said in a statement. What Colin Powell's surprise endorsement of Barack Obama revealed about his view of America's future All living former presidents issued statements on Powell, with Donald Trump characteristically breaking decorum to issue a scathing criticism of Powell\u2019s involvement in the Iraq War. Barack Obama called Powell an \u201cexemplary soldier and an exemplary patriot.\u201d \u201cEveryone who worked with General Powell appreciated his clarity of thought, insistence on seeing all sides, and ability to execute. And although he\u2019d be the first to acknowledge that he didn\u2019t get every call right, his actions reflected what he believed was best for America and the people he served,\u201d Obama said. Obama said: \u201cIt was the way Colin Powell saw the world \u2013 not as a starry-eyed idealist, but as someone with deep and abiding faith in this country and what it stands for \u2013 that made him such a central figure.\u201d Bush said Powell was \u201csuch a favorite of Presidents that he earned the Presidential Medal of Freedom \u2013 twice.\u201d \u201cHe was highly respected at home and abroad.\u00a0And most important, Colin was a family man and a friend,\u201d Bush said. Bill and Hillary Clinton called Powell a \u201ccourageous soldier, a skilled commander, a dedicated diplomat, and a good and decent man.\u201d \u201cThe son of immigrants, he rose to the top levels of military, civilian, and non-governmental service through intelligence, character, and the ability to see the big picture and attend to the smallest details,\u201d their statement reads. \u201cHe lived the promise of America, and spent a lifetime working to help our country, especially our young people, live up to its own ideals and noblest aspirations at home and around the world.\u201d \u201cRosalynn and I join so many around the world in mourning the loss of General Colin Powell. A true patriot and public servant, we were honored to work beside him to strengthen communities in the United States, help resolve conflict in Haiti, and observe elections in Jamaica,\u201d Jimmy Carter said. He continued, \u201cHis courage and integrity will be an inspiration for generations to come. We will keep his family in our prayers during this difficult time.\u201d Trump struck a different tone on Tuesday morning, criticizing Powell and the coverage of his death. \u201cWonderful to see Colin Powell, who made big mistakes on Iraq and famously, so-called weapons of mass destruction, be treated in death so beautifully by the Fake News Media,\u201d Trump said in a statement. \u201cHope that happens to me someday. He was a classic RINO, if even that, always being the first to attack other Republicans. He made plenty of mistakes, but anyway, may he rest in peace!\u201d This story has been updated with additional information. CNN\u2019s Devan Cole contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Let me tell you a little story. Nine years ago, Barack Obama won a second term in office, and there was talk of an emerging Democratic majority in presidential elections. Then came Donald Trump, the least liked major party nominee of all time, who won the 2016 election \u2014 albeit without winning the popular vote. Now, there is talk of Democrats potentially being locked out of a Senate majority for a time to come because of trends in the electorate. I am skeptical of this \u2013 at least over the long term. History tells us that parties adjust messaging and tend to find the best pathway to a majority, leaving this to be a 50/50 country on average. Political scientist David Hopkins articulates the idea of this nation being a 50/50 one well. He notes that since the 1980 elections, Democrats and Republicans have won control of the House, Senate and presidency about the same number of times. They have controlled all three for about the same time, including for the Democrats at this point. This shouldn\u2019t be surprising. As political analyst Sean Trende posited in the book \u201cThe Lost Majority,\u201d history is filled with examples of majorities falling apart and the parties coming in and out of power. The book was published before the 2012 elections and has held up quite well. Obama won a second term with a decent economy in 2012. Despite Trump being unpopular as he was, we saw the presidency change hands after 2016 as it often does when one party has been in the White House for more than a term. Then we saw a president lose in 2020 with a weak, though not terrible, economy and a pandemic unlike anything the country had experienced in more than a century. All of these election results were predicted to a fairly accurate degree by fundamentals based political science models. So why would the future be any different when it comes to the Senate? Well it comes down to two pretty simple points. First, Democratic power is more concentrated than Republican power in terms of geography. You can see this in the 2020 results with\u00a0now-President\u00a0Joe Biden\u00a0reaching\u00a0a clear majority in the Electoral College and popular vote, but only winning 25 states. Trump, on the other hand, took 30 states in 2016, despite losing the popular vote and winning with a similar number of electoral votes. Second, and this is key, presidential and Senate voting patterns are more closely aligned than at any point in recent history. Just one state (Maine in 2020) voted differently in the Senate and presidential races that were on the ballot in the last two presidential elections. And since each state has an equal number of senators, a nation that votes 50/50 in the popular vote on the presidential level will have more Republican senators over the long-term because that translates into winning more states. To be clear, the idea of Republicans having a structural advantage in the Senate isn\u2019t a new one. It\u2019s one I made in 2013 when I was trying to rebuff the talk of an emerging Democratic majority, which is why I take the point so seriously. But I\u2019m not sure I was correct eight years ago. The thing I didn\u2019t take into account is that this hasn\u2019t been a 50/50 nation in the presidential popular vote over the last three decades. Democrats have earned more votes nationwide in seven of the previous eight presidential races. That\u2019s the most popular vote wins in eight presidential elections for either party since the Democratic Party was founded in the first half of the 19th century. Republicans, of course, have still managed to win three of the last eight presidential elections. Recently, the party has adjusted to win elections with fewer votes by having their votes are concentrated in the right places. This is something some Republicans note openly. Indeed, the nomination of Trump was a tacit acknowledgment of that strategy. You put someone on the presidential ticket whose support comes disproportionately from White voters without a college degree, which is a group that has a disproportionate amount of power in the Electoral College (in large part because of the Great Lake battleground states). In doing so, you\u2019re losing more voters overall, but allowing you to win with fewer votes because they\u2019re in the right places. Over the long term this has come out to being close to a wash in states won. Since 1992, Democrats have won 25.5 states in the median election. Republicans have won 24.5. On average, Democrats have won 25 states to Republicans 25. In the last three presidential elections, Democrats have won 25 states in the median election and 24 on average. I point out the last three because the strong correlation between presidential and Senate results really only started in the 2010s. If you play out these Senate elections over and over again, you\u2019d probably end up with pretty equal power in the Senate between Democrats and Republicans assuming straight ticket voting between Senate and presidential voting. To be clear, this doesn\u2019t mean that Republicans won\u2019t end up winning the Senate more times than Democrats. If voters are prone to balancing power (which they usually do), Republicans will do well in midterms and that could carry over to more wins overall because only one-third of the Senate is up for election every presidential cycle. Republicans could easily take back control of the Senate in 2022, which I think is the most likely outcome. It\u2019s that\u00a0the default isn\u2019t as pro-Republican as one might assume. I\u2019ll end by saying we have no idea if the current degree of straight ticket voting will stay the same, pick up or even shrink in years to come. We don\u2019t know what the coalitions will look like. Just like Trump came on the scene and exacerbated the educational divide, another candidate may change the electoral calculus in the future. Parties and their messages aren\u2019t stagnant. Just this past election, Biden actually\u00a0performed\u00a0better by\u00a0a few points\u00a0among White voters without a college degree than Hillary Clinton. At the same time, the gap between Whites and people of color (which used to be growing)\u00a0shrunk, something\u00a0I don\u2019t think most thought would happen given Trump\u2019s rhetoric. During the Biden presidency, that racial divide in voter preferences may be going down even more, as\u00a0The\u00a0Washington Post\u2019s Phillip Bump has called attention to. The bottom line is no one knows where voter opinion and election outcomes will go from here.",

            "article_content": "For President Joe Biden and congressional Democrats, the $3.5 trillion budget reconciliation bill was a chance to fulfill their longstanding dreams of expanding health care coverage. The proposed package includes broadening Medicare to provide dental, vision and hearing benefits, expanding Medicaid in the 12 states that refused to adopt the Affordable Care Act provision and making permanent generous premium subsidies for Obamacare policies. To help pay for it, the Democrats would enable Medicare to negotiate drug prices \u2013 another longtime goal. But policy priorities have run into the harsh buzz saw of politics, which is threatening the ability of the party to get more Americans covered and improve equity in health care. The Democrats have fractured over the size of the legislation, with moderate members saying they won\u2019t accept such massive measures. The party needs the votes of all of its 50 senators to pass the bill. West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin has said he\u2019ll support a $1.5 trillion package, though the Democrat acknowledged earlier this month that he wouldn\u2019t rule out going as high as $1.9 trillion to $2.2 trillion. The party is now wrestling with shrinking the package, which will likely mean jettisoning some members\u2019 most coveted provisions or reducing their generosity to fit in as much as possible. One or more of the health care measures are also at risk. \u201cIt\u2019s very difficult to weigh the tradeoffs in these different expansions,\u201d said Tricia Neuman, executive director of the Kaiser Family Foundation\u2019s Program on Medicare Policy. \u201cThere are competing needs. There\u2019s a strong constituency for each of these proposals.\u201d In a letter to colleagues last week, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi suggested that Democrats should do \u201cfewer things well,\u201d but later indicated that she hopes lawmakers won\u2019t have to drop anything and would instead reduce time frames of the provisions. Progressives are leaning towards retaining as many measures as possible and constraining their cost in other ways. \u201cWe\u2019re continuing to have these conversations inside of the caucus, you know. Part of the challenge is we still don\u2019t know what the final number is going to be,\u201d Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock of Georgia told CNN. Warnock, who is up for re-election next year, is one of the biggest advocates in the Senate for expanding Medicaid. Some 14.5% of Georgia residents were uninsured in 2020 \u2013 third highest in the nation, according to a Kaiser analysis of Census data. \u201cWe have a chance, unlike any chance we have had before, to close the coverage gap and save lives,\u201d Warnock wrote in a USA Today op-ed in early October. \u201cNow is the time to take it.\u201d The reconciliation package would extend coverage to a total of more than 2 million low-income adults in Georgia and in the 11 other states that have not broadened Medicaid. It would initially provide them with premium subsidies to buy Affordable Care Act coverage and then shift them to a new federal Medicaid expansion program in 2025, paid for entirely by the federal government. How much this would cost has not been made public yet. This measure, however, isn\u2019t sitting so well with lawmakers from states that have already opted to expand Medicaid \u2013 and pick up 10% of the cost. \u201cThe way it was described to me is the feds are going to pay for the Medicaid. Well, what about Montana? We\u2019ve already expanded it,\u201d said Democratic Sen. Jon Tester of Montana, a GOP-controlled state. \u201cDoes that mean the state\u2019s share still gets paid for by the state because if it does, that\u2019s going to be hard to sell.\u201d Expanding Medicaid to low-income adults would allow the Democrats to deliver for this key demographic ahead of the 2022 midterm election in hopes of maintaining control of Congress. And it would help fulfill the party\u2019s promise to improve racial equity. \u201cThis is the last population and probably the most vulnerable of all the populations that\u2019s left on its own for health care,\u201d said Leslie Dach, founder of Protect Our Care, which seeks to increase coverage. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen the effects of that in this pandemic.\u201d Broadening Medicare benefits would serve a similar purpose for attracting the votes of senior citizens, another key constituency. The reconciliation bill would provide vision benefits starting next October and hearing services the following October. Dental coverage, which would cost far more, would only begin in 2028. Though the Congressional Budget Office has yet to weigh in on this latest proposal, it found that a 2019 House bill to add these benefits would raise spending by about $358 billion over a 10-year period. Nearly half of Medicare beneficiaries, or 24 million Americans, did not have dental coverage in 2019, according to Kaiser. Many also lack vision and hearing benefits. Those enrolled in Medicare Advantage plans are more likely to have coverage for all three services, but the extent of those benefits varies. Sen. Bernie Sanders of Vermont, an independent who caucuses with the Democrats, is the most vocal proponent in the Senate for adding these benefits to Medicare. He has contended that it\u2019s a red line for him and other progressives. \u201cShould we tell elderly people who have no teeth in their mouth, they can\u2019t hear, they can\u2019t afford to buy a pair of eyeglasses that we should not expand Medicare?\u201d Sanders said when asked what could be trimmed in the bill. \u201cWe can afford to do this.\u201d Manchin, however, has raised concerns about expanding a federal program that\u2019s already on shaky financial footing. He\u2019s floated limiting these additional benefits based on income in an effort to reduce the cost. It would be the first time Medicare coverage would be restricted by earnings. As part of their $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package earlier this year, Democrats were finally able to address a major shortcoming of the Affordable Care Act \u2013 its lack of affordability for many Americans, particularly in the middle class. The American Rescue Plan temporarily beefed up the law\u2019s premium subsidies. Making these permanent in the reconciliation package is a high priority for many in the party\u2019s leadership. For this year and next, enrollees pay no more than 8.5% of their income toward coverage, down from nearly 10%, while lower-income policyholders receive subsidies that eliminate their premiums completely. Also, those earning more than 400% of the federal poverty level \u2013 about $51,000 for an individual and $104,800 for a family of four in 2021 \u2013 are now eligible for help for the first time. These changes helped convince an additional 2.8 million Americans to sign up for policies during the special enrollment period Biden enacted earlier this year. Making the enhanced subsidies permanent and filling in the Medicaid coverage gap by expanding eligibility for assistance would reduce the number of uninsured Americans by nearly one-quarter, or 7 million people, in 2022, according to a recent Urban Institute report. The increased cost would add up to $442 billion over 10 years. But letting the beefed up subsidies expire could have the opposite effect. Democrats \u201chave to deal with the reality that they\u2019ve in the short term expanded access and affordability through the ARPA. That would be something that gets rolled back if it\u2019s not extended,\u201d Cynthia Cox, director of Kaiser\u2019s Program on the ACA, said of the American Rescue Plan provision. One way Democrats were hoping to help pay for their massive spending bill was to allow Medicare to negotiate prices with prescription drug manufacturers, which could be used to offset $700 billion of the cost. The House version would require the Health & Human Services secretary to negotiate maximum fair prices for at least 50 and as many as 250 high-cost medications that lack competition, including insulin. The price would be available to Medicare beneficiaries and to individuals enrolled in group health plans. Large majorities of Americans across the political spectrum favor permitting Medicare to negotiate, even after they hear the argument that drug companies need to charge high prices to fund research, a recent Kaiser tracking poll found. Though allowing Medicare to negotiate has been a longtime priority of the party, moderate House and Senate Democrats have resisted supporting it. The powerful pharmaceutical industry has also lobbied hard against the effort. Pelosi indicated Thursday that progressives may have to scrap the proposal in order to get a deal on the massive social safety net package. But she told KQED in San Francisco: \u201cWe\u2019re still making that fight. I\u2019m not even sure we\u2019ll get it in this bill. We\u2019ll get something of that, but it won\u2019t be the complete package that many of us have been fighting for a long time.\u201d CNN\u2019s Manu Raju contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "The United States is officially a member of the controversial United Nations Human Rights Council again, reversing former President Donald Trump\u2019s withdrawal three years ago. The US was elected on Thursday in an uncontested ballot of member countries by the UN General Assembly. President Joe Biden had said he would return the US to the Geneva-based organization. Cameroon, Eritrea and the United Arab Emirates also joined the Human Rights Council on Thursday despite concerns over their own domestic records voiced by human rights organizations. The US got 168 votes, a slight drop from what other countries received to get three-year terms. The UN Human Rights Council describes itself as \u201can inter-governmental body within the United Nations system responsible for strengthening the promotion and protection of human rights around the globe and for addressing situations of human rights violations and make recommendations on them.\u201d Biden on Thursday applauded the US\u2019 election to the council, saying in a statement, \u201cI am grateful for the support of nations from around the world for our campaign, and I look forward to the United States once more being a constructive voice that works to help push the Human Rights Council to live up to its mandate and to protect the values we hold dear for all people.\u201d US Ambassador to the UN Linda Thomas-Greenfield said in a statement celebrating the American reentry to the council that the US\u2019 initial efforts on the council will focus on Afghanistan, Myanmar, China, Ethiopia, Syria and Yemen. She said the US\u2019 goals will be to \u201cstand with human rights defenders and speak out against violations and abuses of human rights.\u201d \u201cMore broadly, we will promote respect for fundamental freedoms and women\u2019s rights, and oppose religious intolerance, racial and ethnic injustices, and violence and discrimination against members of minority groups, including LGBTQI+ persons and persons with disabilities,\u201d she continued, adding that the US \u201cwill press against the election of countries with egregious human rights records and encourage those committed to promoting and protecting human rights both in their own countries and abroad to seek membership.\u201d Notably, Thomas-Greenfield said the US \u201cwill oppose the Council\u2019s disproportionate attention on Israel, which includes the Council\u2019s only standing agenda item targeting a single country. \u201d Then-US Ambassador the UN Nikki Haley accused the council of bias against Israel and failing to hold human rights abusers accountable when the US left the panel in 2018. \u201cFor too long,\u201d Haley said in 2018, \u201cthe Human Rights Council has been a protector of human rights abusers, and a cesspool of political bias.\u201d \u201cHuman rights abusers continue to serve on, and be elected to, the council,\u201d she said. \u201cThe world\u2019s most inhumane regimes continue to escape its scrutiny, and the council continues politicizing scapegoating of countries with positive human rights records in an attempt to distract from the abusers in its ranks. Biden\u2019s Secretary of State, Antony Blinken, announced the US would reengage with the council in February. There are 47 member states on the council, and current members include countries that have been accused of grave human rights abuses such as China, Russia and Venezuela. In a statement issued Thursday, Blinken recognized the US readmission into the group and acknowledged that the council \u201csuffers from serious flaws, including disproportionate attention on Israel and the membership of several states with egregious human rights records.\u201d \u201cTogether, we must push back against attempts to subvert the ideals upon which the Human Rights Council was founded, including that each person is endowed with human rights and that states are obliged to protect those rights,\u201d Blinken added. The council has long been criticized for including countries with tarnished records on protecting human rights in their own territory. Ahead of Thursday\u2019s vote at the UN, the non-governmental organization Human Rights Watch warned that a noncompetitive election \u201cvirtually guarantees seats for candidate countries with abysmal rights records,\u201d calling on UN member countries to refrain from voting for Cameroon, Eritrea, United Arab Emirates specifically among others. And the American Civil Liberties Union urged the Biden administration to prioritize human rights in domestic policy following the US\u2019 reelection to the council. \u201cPresident Biden during his presidential campaign promised to reestablish relations with international partners and center human rights at home and abroad under his administration and to lead by the power of example,\u201d the ACLU statement said. \u201cHowever, despite the election to the council, the United States\u2019 human rights record remains very problematic, not least because the country hasn\u2019t yet ratified or fully implemented key international human rights treaties and failed to implement recommendations made by regional and global human rights bodies.\u201d The US\u2019 reelection to the Human Rights Council is the latest effort to restore US standing on the global stage through involvement in multilateral organizations and treaties spurned by the Trump administration. Biden reversed the US departure from the World Health Organization and the Paris climate accords. The President said in his Thursday statement that he looks forward to participating in a virtual summit for democracy in December. This story has been updated with a statement from President Joe Biden. CNN\u2019s Donald Judd and Jennifer Hansler contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell on Saturday told Attorney General Merrick Garland that parents \u201cabsolutely should be telling\u201d local schools what to teach amid a debate over mask and vaccine mandates, the role of racial equity education and transgender rights in schools that has become a flash point ahead of the 2022 midterms. \u201cParents absolutely should be telling their local schools what to teach. This is the very basis of representative government,\u201d McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, wrote in a letter. \u201cThey do this both in elections and \u2013 as protected by the First Amendment of the Constitution \u2013 while petitioning their government for redress of grievance. Telling elected officials they\u2019re wrong is democracy, not intimidation.\u201d CNN has reached out to the Justice Department for comment. The letter from the Senate Minority Leader comes in response to a Justice Department effort to address the increase in harassment, intimidation and threats of violence against school board members, teachers and workers in public schools. Earlier this week, Garland directed the FBI and US attorneys\u2019 offices to meet with federal, state and local law enforcement leaders \u201cto discuss strategies for addressing this disturbing trend,\u201d the department said in a news release. \u201cThreats against public servants are not only illegal, they run counter to our nation\u2019s core values,\u201d Garland wrote in a memo about the directive. \u201cThose who dedicate their time and energy to ensuring that our children receive a proper education in a safe environment deserve to be able to do their work without fear for their safety.\u201d The National School Boards Association had asked the Biden administration for assistance in dealing with threats against educators for approving mask policies aimed at protecting against Covid-19 and threats over false \u201cpropaganda\u201d about critical race theory being taught in classrooms even though that \u201cremains a complex law school and graduate school subject well beyond the scope of a K-12 class.\u201d Still, Republicans are using talking points similar to McConnell\u2019s ahead of the 2022 contests and members of the party have already sought to harness the recent Republican focus on education issues in the Virginia governor\u2019s race. Virginia Republican gubernatorial nominee Glenn Youngkin quickly turned a comment on the matter by Democratic opponent Terry McAuliffe into an attack ad aimed at invigorating base GOP voters and parents ahead of the November election. The moment came during the second and final debate between the two late last month. \u201cI\u2019m not going to let parents come into schools and actually take books out and make their own decision,\u201d McAuliffe said over what should be taught in schools. The former governor later added, \u201cI don\u2019t think parents should be telling schools what they should teach.\u201d The comments, after getting considerable pick up within conservative media, quickly became a Youngkin ad and have already become a staple of Youngkin\u2019s pitch in the closing weeks of the race to lead the Commonwealth.

His campaign hopes it will serve as a rallying cry that could harness the recent Republican focus on education issues, ranging from what should be taught in public schools to issues around transgender students. But the ultimate goal is to cut into McAuliffe\u2019s support with swing voters in key areas like the vote-rich Northern Virginia suburbs near Washington, DC. Some voters \u2013 particularly those Republicans who were drawn to Youngkin already \u2013 were motivated by Youngkin\u2019s message. Caitlin Davey, a mother from Frederick County, recently pulled her 8-year-old son, Camden, out of Virginia Public Schools. \u201cI can\u2019t wear a mask,\u201d he said as they waited for Youngkin to speak on Wednesday in Winchester. \u201cThat\u2019s part of the reason,\u201d added Davey, who was wearing a T-shirt that labeled the White House \u201cstolen property.\u201d Then she listed other issues: \u201cCritical race theory, same sex transgender issues.\u201d Using the rights of parents as an umbrella, Youngkin has been able to tuck in a number of other issues conservative activists have weaponized to rile up mostly White parents in suburbs across the country, including mask and vaccine mandates in schools, the role of racial equity education and transgender rights. These fights, especially on masks, have been particularly potent in the Northern Virginia suburbs, where political operatives from Washington have helped foment the anger. Critical race theory, a concept that\u2019s been around for decades and that seeks to understand and address inequality and racism in the United States, has become a political catalyst for Republicans, with lawmakers in states like Tennessee and Idaho banning it from being taught. Schools boards across the country, including in Virginia, have also been venues for these complaints. The same is true for the rights of transgender students. Dozens of states have looked to pass laws aimed at curbing the rights of transgender people across the country, including in how they participate in school sports. The issue has been particularly potent in Virginia. McAuliffe has responded to the attacks by accusing Youngkin of modeling himself after former President Donald Trump, a Republican who lost Virginia by 10 percentage points in 2020. \u201cI really get sick and tired of people like Glenn Youngkin and Donald Trump. They constantly are dividing people. They\u2019re constantly turning people against one another,\u201d he said in an interview with CNN\u2019s Sara Murray. \u201cAnd why are we doing this to our students? All we want to do is give them a quality education.\u201d McAuliffe, whose campaign has looked to make the fight against the coronavirus the focus of his bid, also accused Youngkin of being \u201cdesperate,\u201d of using the issue as a \u201cdog whistle\u201d to mobilize some of his voters and obscuring the fact that the Republican\u2019s opposition to mask mandates in schools is \u201clife threatening to children.\u201d The focus on issues like critical race theory and what should be taught in schools is a far cry from what initially motivated Youngkin\u2019s campaign. The businessman-turned-politician began his bid by focusing squarely on election integrity, and he has also looked to push a message that casts him as a political outsider who could bring a business perspective to Virginia. Youngkin, however, clearly sees the issue as a way to knock McAuliffe. \u201cHe not only wants to stand between you and your children. He wants to make government a tool to silence us,\u201d said Youngkin of McAuliffe to a crowd of about one hundred Virginians in Winchester Wednesday evening, mischaracterizing an effort by Attorney General Merrick Garland to address the increasing threat of violence faced by educators and school board members. Youngkin\u2019s campaign, in response to McAuliffe, also launched an initiative called \u201cParents Matter,\u201d circulating petitions and distributing fliers at community events to grow the anger at McAuliffe. Many of the parents in attendance at Youngkin\u2019s event on Wednesday expressed similar views to Davey. They said their children weren\u2019t being taught what they thought mattered and that too many kids were getting participation trophies. Tammy Yoder, whose kids are also private school educated, didn\u2019t like books she saw when she said she researched what was offered in the local school district, defining \u201cwhat marriage is\u201d and \u201cwhat families looks like.\u201d \u201cOur children our suffering,\u201d said Heather Lockridge, a Frederick County parent who also pulled her children, ages ten and eight, out of public school. \u201cThey are creating a divide and children don\u2019t know color.\u201d For Republicans, like Chris Saxman, a former Virginia state legislator and Republican strategist, the latest Youngkin strategy is a winner. \u201cHe made a mistake and Youngkin\u2019s making him pay for it,\u201d Saxman said. He added: \u201cThere\u2019s only so much political advantage you can gain from a particular singular issue. This expands it beyond critical race theory. This brings in everything. It would be political malpractice not to do what Glenn Youngkin is doing.\u201d",

Chutkan added that the rioters \u201csoiled and defaced the halls of the Capitol and showed their contempt for the rule of law.\u201d She said: \u201cThe country is watching to see what the consequences are for something that has not ever happened in the country before.\u201d Her comments came during a sentencing hearing for Matthew Mazzocco of Texas, who pleaded guilty to a misdemeanor charge of illegally demonstrating in the Capitol building \u2013 a typical plea deal that the Justice Department has offered to nonviolent rioters charged with a number of lower-level offenses. On Friday, Judge Trevor McFadden, also of the DC District Court, said during another Capitol rioter\u2019s sentencing that he believes the Justice Department should have been more \u201ceven-handed\u201d in their prosecution of the Capitol rioters, suggesting that they\u2019ve been treated more harshly than the rioters in last year\u2019s racial unrest. The Justice Department has argued the violent breach of the Capitol \u2013 in which members of Congress and the vice president had to be evacuated for their safety, halting the vote confirming the presidential election \u2013 was far worse than other riots, in both the scale of the attack on the federal building and its disruption of the congressional session. Some riot defendants have argued in court that they shouldn\u2019t face felony-level charges for obstructing the congressional proceeding, but judges have not yet ruled on those arguments. Chutkan, without directly commenting on the case McFadden handled, said that the riot was \u201cno mere protest\u201d and that defendants, including Mazzocco, were facing lenient treatment \u201cdespite his deliberate, premediated decision to come to the District and try to disrupt the peaceful transition of power.\u201d \u201cMr. Mazzocco did not go to the United States Capitol out of any love for our country,\u201d Chutkan said. \u201cHe went for one man.\u201d So far, more than 90 Capitol riot defendants have pleaded guilty to federal charges. Twelve have been sentenced. Mazzocco is the sixth Capitol riot defendant who has received jail time.",

Here\u2019s the first of a number of stories we\u2019ll write between now and the end of the year on the most important element of US politics that most Americans don\u2019t spend too much time worrying about: redistricting. It\u2019s a leveling factor in the partisanship of the country. It doesn\u2019t matter quite so much that there are more Democrats than Republicans in this country since Republicans control more state legislatures and, as a result, a lot more of the redistricting process. Pay attention to the drawing of the maps. Now \u2013 between the release of the once-a-decade Census and the next midterms, in 2022 \u2013 is when states redraw their congressional maps and there will be warring proposals, standoffs and court battles across the country before the final lines are drawn. Redistricting. Both parties have a history of drawing maps to improve their standing in Congress and protect incumbents. Republicans have been much more successful at it in recent decades. Gerrymandering. Since the 1800s, when Massachusetts Gov. Elbridge Gerry was accused of drawing a district to look like a salamander \u2013 get it? Gerrymander? \u2013 it\u2019s been a political process. Gerry is also interesting as one of just three delegates who refused to sign the Constitution. He pushed for the Bill of Rights and was later vice president.    There\u2019s art and science in creatively drawing lines to cram people of similar views and party registrations together. The outcome very much affect who controls Congress. That\u2019s especially true this year when Democrats have a 5-seat majority and are heading into a congressional election cycle when the president\u2019s party almost always loses seats. Trivia! Name two of the four times since 1862 when the president\u2019s party DID NOT lose seats in the midterm. Voters don\u2019t generally like overt partisanship in the drawing of these maps. Given the opportunity in statewide elections, they\u2019ve taken authority from state legislatures and handed it to nonpartisan, bipartisan or independent commissions. But as David Daley of FairVote writes in The New York Times, partisan legislature often try to influence the process anyway. He takes the examples of Arizona, Ohio, Michigan, Virginia and Colorado. In Arizona, he points out, the independent commission member is hardly independent. Republicans have an advantage. Most of the states where the process is wholly or mostly controlled by one party are in the South and Midwest, according to a review of by the Cook Political Report. Cook\u2019s analysis of the current state of the process in all 50 states suggests that after Republicans will gain perhaps one or two seats (they say 1.5 seats) when the dust settles from the redistricting process. Reapportionment. Redistricting is the redrawing of lines. Reapportionment is the allocation of seats to each state. When the Census bureau reapportioned seats this year, it gave a net gain to seats controlled by Republicans; that\u2019s where the population grew. However, that does not mean the growth in people equaled a growth in Republicans. \u201cAt the heart of any attempted forecast is a paradox. Republican states picked up the most congressional seats and Republican legislatures control the process in the most states, but Republican counties lost population while Democratic counties gained,\u201d writes Elaine Kamarck at Brookings. Among the states that gained seats after the 2020 Census Among states losing seats after the 2020 Census The Texas example. This year Texas is a good case study to learn about reapportionment and redistricting. It gained more seats through reapportionment \u2013 two \u2013 than any other state after the Census. Republicans control the redistricting process. Much of shift in the state\u2019s demographics is toward Democrats, but as the Princeton Gerrymandering Project\u2019s analysis argues, the first proposed map protects GOP incumbents and it makes most districts more Republican than the state as a whole. They give the map an \u201cF\u201d on their report card. State districts are also on the table. It\u2019s not just congressional districts being redrawn. The Texas Tribune\u2019s review of the state legislative district proposal dissects it from both a racial and partisan standpoint. On the racial makeup of state legislative districts, the Tribune writes that 95% of the state\u2019s population growth captured in the 2020 Census was fueled by people of color. \u201cBut, the new map creates fewer districts where Black and Hispanic people make up a majority of eligible voters. Black and Hispanic Texans make up two racial groups that along with Asian Texans outpaced the growth of white residents in the state over the last decade.\u201d INTERACTIVE Race and ethnicity across the nation It\u2019s against the constitution to draw congressional lines by race, but Texas Republicans say they were \u201crace blind\u201d in proposing these maps. The Supreme Court has also recently taken a hands off approach to gerrymandering for partisan reasons. On partisan leanings, the Tribune writes that the old map includes 76 districts that went for Trump in 2020. The new proposal has 86 that would have gone for Trump. The commission model. Princeton\u2019s Gerrymandering project gives Colorado\u2019s commission-approved map, which is now before the state\u2019s Supreme Court an A for partisan fairness, although it gets lower marks for competitiveness. The map has three seats that lean toward Republicans and four that lean toward Democrats. In Michigan, where neither party completely controls the process and an independent commission made up of citizens draws and enacts the lines, there have been numerous proposed maps that include various combinations of safe and competitive seats that, according to 538, could end up benefiting either Republicans or Democrats. Democrats in charge. In Oregon, where Democrats control the process, it is already completed after the state approved its new map. Nebraska and Maine have also completed their maps. Oregon gained one seat in reapportionment, but emerges from the redistricting process with fewer competitive seats, just one, according to 538. Republicans have accused Democrats of gerrymandering. There are proposals to end gerrymandering. The creation of independent commissions is not the only idea to do away with gerrymandering. Democratic Rep. Don Beyer of Virginia has proposed a new law to neuter the redistricting process. He wants much larger congressional districts that elect multiple lawmakers, forcing candidates to appeal to a broader range of voters. It\u2019s an interesting idea, but it doesn\u2019t have much traction at the moment. *** TRIVIA ANSWER: There are exactly four midterms in the 40 since 1862 when the President\u2019s party didn\u2019t lose seats, according to Brookings.",

            "article_content": "Critics often describe the wave of voter restriction laws sweeping the nation as a new version of Jim Crow, the 19th century minstrel figure whose stage name became the symbol of a brutal era of Black oppression. But if you want to understand how these new voter restriction laws also oppress White people, it\u2019s more useful to invoke another cultural figure: Wile E. Coyote. Wile E. Coyote is the Looney Tunes cartoon character whose obsessive quest to catch the Road Runner always backfires. Though he employs an array of outlandish gadgets such as jet-powered roller skates, the coyote\u2019s schemes to capture his prey inevitably ends up injuring him instead. This comparison is not designed to make light of voter suppression, which is an alarming attack on our democracy. It\u2019s to make a point that doesn\u2019t get emphasized enough as Democrats approach a crucial stretch in their efforts to pass a new voting rights bill: White people \u2013 not just people of color \u2013 have been some of the biggest victims of voter suppression tactics. The Republican Party\u2019s crusade to make voting more difficult isn\u2019t just morally wrong. It\u2019s folly. By obsessively chasing the phantom of widespread voter fraud, they are actually hurting their own base of White voters. So far this year, at least 18 states have passed laws that make it more difficult to vote. All but one are led by GOP-controlled legislatures. Some of the more obvious boomerang effects of these laws have already been noted. Voter restrictions anger and mobilize voters of color. They make it more difficult for older, rural White citizens to vote. And they discourage some White voters from even participating in elections. Even some GOP leaders are now warning that restrictive voting laws are hurting their base.  One commentator went further, saying Republicans are \u201cinadvertently suppressing their own voters.\u201d   That\u2019s the conclusion Joel Mathis came to after examining the results of the recent recall election in California, where Gov. Gavin Newsom decisively thwarted the GOP-led effort to remove him from office. Initial signs suggested Republicans were energized after conservative talk show host Larry Elder entered the race, but almost every major demographic group in the state rejected the recall. The effort to replace Newsom failed, in part, because Elder and other GOP leaders discouraged many of their own supporters from voting by alleging voter fraud in the lead-up to the election, Mathis said in a column in The Week. This was the same dynamic that led to Democrats winning Georgia and control of Congress in the last presidential election, Mathis noted. \u201cWe now have a likely answer to the question of what will happen if Republicans keep manufacturing charges of \u2018voter fraud\u2019 every time they lose an election: Fewer Republican voters will go to the polls,\u201d Mathis said. But there are other, less apparent reasons why voter suppression tactics not only harm White people but can literally cost them their lives. Take, for example, recent comments by Gov. Tate Reeves of Mississippi, which has the highest death rate for Covid-19 deaths in the US and one of the worst vaccination rates in the country. Reeves says every Covid death breaks his heart but told CNN he still opposes President Joe Biden\u2019s vaccine mandates because they are \u201ctyrannical.\u201d The fact that Mississippi has some of the nation\u2019s most restrictive voting laws and an overall health system that\u2019s ranked dead last in the nation may seem unrelated. But some say they\u2019re not, because restrictive voting laws lead to voters electing less competent political leaders who don\u2019t respond to the needs of all their constituents. That\u2019s what Alex Keena, a political scientist, discovered while researching a book he co-authored, \u201cGerrymandering the States: Partisanship, Race, and the Transformation of American Federalism.\u201d Keena says members of Congress who get elected to office in part because of restrictive election laws or partisan gerrymandering often focus on cultural wedge issues or conspiracy theories because they\u2019re in safe voting districts where they don\u2019t have to address a diverse constituency. \u201cIt leads to legislators who are good at getting elected and raising money, but they don\u2019t know a lot about government,\u201d says Keena, a political science professor at Virginia Commonwealth University. This inability to govern can have lethal consequences. Keena says. States that enacted partisan gerrymandering \u2013 redrawing congressional districts to favor the Republican party and deprive Black people of voting power \u2013 tended to have higher infant mortality rates, Keena says. They also were more likely to challenge the Affordable Care Act in courts and were generally less responsive to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020 than Republican-controlled states that didn\u2019t gerrymander, he found. There is a phrase that describes what happens to some White voters in states like Mississippi. It\u2019s called \u201cDying of Whiteness\u201d \u2013 the name of a 2019 book by Jonathan M. Metzl that describes a political dynamic where racial, \u201cbacklash governance\u201d leads to White voters picking political leaders who enact policies that tend to make them sicker, poorer and more likely to die early by gun suicide. This same dynamic is partly why most of the counties in the US with the fewest fully vaccinated people are in Southern states led by GOP governors. \u201cWhen state governments rig the voting rules to suppress the voting power of their opponents, there are measurable decreases in public health and policy outcomes that affect everyone,\u201d Keena says. Republican leaders who seek to restrict voting rights also hurt themselves by turning off young White voters who could make the difference for them in future elections. Some GOP leaders make an effort to appeal to young voters, but their party\u2019s voter restriction laws send another message: We don\u2019t want you to vote. This message hurts young White voters by breeding political cynicism and apathy, says Mary A. Evins, coordinator for the American Democracy Project, a program that encourages civic engagement among youth. She says \u201cthe big chunk\u201d of White voters impacted by voter restriction laws are the youngest voters. Many students already offer all sorts of excuses for not voting: They\u2019re too busy with their classes and they believe their vote doesn\u2019t count. Voting is an acquired habit that needs to be taught and practiced to take root, Evins says. The best way to ensure that students turn into good citizens who vote in every election is through steps such as placing polling places on every college campus \u2013 something discouraged by many new, restrictive voting laws, she says. \u201cMake voting easy and accessible to first-time voters, \u201csays Evins, a history professor at Middle Tennessee State University. \u201cAnd that is precisely what the voter suppression laws expressly opt not to do,\u201d she says. \u201cInstead they limit opportunities, narrow locations and choices.\u201d The Democrats\u2019 voting overhaul bill would address many of Evins\u2019 concerns. The new bill would make Election Day a public holiday, make it easier to register to vote, ensure states have early voting for federal elections and allow all voters to request mail-in ballots. Voter suppression hurts White people in another, more insidious way.  It silences their voice in the political process. A famous 2015 study concluded that the US is not a democracy but an oligarchy where the elites, not ordinary voters, determine public policy. That study validated a belief among many lower- and middle-class White voters that politicians listen to wealthy donors but not to them. Voter suppression laws make it easier for political leaders to do just that \u2013 favor wealthy people over others, says Lindsey Cormack, an expert on voter suppression and elections at the Stevens Institute of Technology in New Jersey. She says that when lawmakers erect additional hoops for Black or brown voters to jump through, they are also making it harder for poor and middle-class White voters to be heard. That\u2019s because those White voters also get less access to the political system and are less likely to contribute to political campaigns. Voter suppression laws \u201censhrine inequalities\u201d by transforming politics into a pay-to-play system where politicians tune out ordinary voters, she says. \u201cVoter suppression laws that make it harder for any poor and middle-class people to vote make it so that members of Congress have less of a reason to listen to the wants of people who are less likely to be able to turn out and vote,\u201d Cormack says. Finally, there is a bigger reason why voter suppression laws could hurt Whites even more in the future. They could weaken the US economy and damage the country\u2019s standing in the world. History tells us this. The first wave of voter suppression laws that targeted Blacks in the South during the late 19th and early 20th century also hurt poor White voters and the Southern economy. The South become an economic backwater where child labor flourished, workers were exploited and state governments did little to invest in social services and public schools for ordinary people. Such measures as poll taxes and literacy tests also prevented poor Whites from voting. The civil rights movement that swept away the apartheid system in the South also helped White people. The fall of Jim Crow lifted the economy of the entire South. It raised the standard of living for White people as new Southern leaders abandoned racial demagoguery to invest more in social services, education and public works that benefitted everyone, Whites included. The passage of landmark civil rights laws like the Voting Rights Act also strengthened the country abroad. It was hard for American political leaders during the Cold War to preach the virtues of democracy when the world was seeing images of Black people being brutalized for trying to vote in Selma, Alabama. The movement that got rid of voter suppression laws inspired Democratic movements around the globe. \u201cWe Shall Overcome,\u201d the civil rights anthem, was sung by pro-democracy demonstrators in China\u2019s Tiananmen Square and in South Africa during the anti-apartheid movement. Why would any political leader want the US return to those days when America\u2019s unequal treatment of its Black citizens made it look like hypocrites on the world stage \u2013 especially at a time when the country is engaged in a geopolitical struggle with autocratic countries like Russia and China that disdain democracy? A return to an updated version of a Jim Crow voting system that led to some of the ugliest chapters in US history wouldn\u2019t just be folly. It would be tragic.",

            "article_content": "For all but eight of the last 30 years, a Republican has occupied the governor\u2019s office in Massachusetts. The state that so many Americans equate with mainline liberalism \u2013 \u201cTaxachusetts\u201d was the GOP\u2019s old derisive nickname \u2013 has a habit of electing Republicans to its top job, even as it sends prominent progressive leaders to Washington. Republicans\u2019 hold on the corner office in Beacon Hill held during the blue wave of 2018, with Gov. Charlie Baker cruising to a second term leading the Commonwealth. But as Baker now weighs seeking reelection again, Democrats are preparing for what is expected to be an uncharacteristically sharp clash over the political character and direction of the Bay State in next year\u2019s gubernatorial race. The contest is already picking up steam as the early entrants to the Democratic primary ramp up their campaigns and try to rev up an intensifying base of progressive voters determined to break what has, for many on the left, become a maddening tradition. \u201cThere\u2019s this real mismatch,\u201d Democratic State Sen. Sonia Chang-D\u00edaz, who entered the race in June, told CNN. \u201cPeople perceive Massachusetts to be a sort of Democratic and progressive bastion. That it\u2019s the land of milk and honey of progressive policies and outcomes.\u201d The reality, she said, is much different \u2013 arguing that years of Republican leadership have been a \u201cdetriment to so many of the fundamental systems that people rely on in our Commonwealth. Schools, public safety, environment, traffic, transportation, economic development systems. These systems have been left to crumble and or haven\u2019t been put in place in the right way in the first place.\u201d As summer comes to an end, there are three prominent Democratic primary candidates: Chang-D\u00edaz, already the first Latina elected to the state senate (and daughter of the country\u2019s first Latino astronaut), would be the state\u2019s first Latina governor; Harvard professor Danielle Allen, an accomplished political theorist who has never run for office, would be the first Black woman to lead the Commonwealth; and Ben Downing, a Pittsfield native who served five terms in the state senate. A high-profile potential fourth entrant, two-term Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey \u2013 the nation\u2019s first out gay state attorney general \u2013 has said she is weighing a bid, but cautioned in July that a decision might not come until the fall. Asked to measure how Healey\u2019s deliberations are affecting the race, Downing was blunt. \u201cIt absolutely has an impact on the campaign, in fundraising and folks who are willing to make commitments one way or the other. And I think that does hold back candidates from starting to build any sense of momentum,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s one of many variables in a really crazy time to be running for office.\u201d Downing, Chang-D\u00edaz and Allen all insisted that, despite Healey\u2019s long shadow, they are focused on crafting the coalitions they believe necessary to defeat Baker \u2013 or, in the event he doesn\u2019t run again, Republican Lt. Gov. Karyn Polito or former State Rep. Geoff Diehl, a Trump-friendly GOP primary candidate. \u201cThere\u2019s a heck of a lot of work to do to change the public understanding of the strengths and weaknesses of the Baker-Polito administration,\u201d Allen said. \u201cAnd that means it requires a heck of a lot of time and a grassroots movement. So the timetable required for beating Baker-Polito is\u2026 it\u2019s already here. Those of us who are working on it, we\u2019re on the timetable that\u2019s necessary.\u201d Since former Gov. Michael Dukakis, the party\u2019s 1988 presidential nominee, left office in 1991, following his second consecutive term and third overall, only one Democrat \u2013 former Gov. Deval Patrick \u2013 has (twice) defeated the GOP gubernatorial nominee. Former state Attorney General Martha Coakley lost narrowly to Baker in 2014. During his nearly eight years in office, Baker has racked up some of the highest approval ratings among the nation\u2019s governors. In an era when state leaders have taken on increasingly high profiles \u2013 first as Democratic executives tried to build a bulwark against former President Donald Trump, and now as Republicans defy President Joe Biden \u2013 Baker has earned a second title of sorts: one of the country\u2019s most popular governors. \u201cThe interesting dynamics are that his popularity is often higher among Democrats than among Republicans,\u201d said MassINC Polling Group President Steve Koczela. \u201cIt was consistent for a while that his favorables were higher among Democrats and Trump\u2019s were higher among Republicans than Baker\u2019s were, even though Baker was extremely popular overall.\u201d That inversion of the typical partisan divide has driven the Democratic candidates to seek out broader coalitions by drawing in new voters. \u201cI have learned a lot of lessons from watching Stacey Abrams,\u201d Allen told CNN. \u201cAnd one of the things she has said consistently is that she goes out there with the goal of connecting with every community in the state.\u201d Chang-D\u00edaz, the only office-holder in the Democratic race at the moment, has enjoyed the highest-profile success so far in attracting the support of movement progressives \u2013 including some of the same young political activists who helped key Massachusetts Sen. Ed Markey\u2019s defeat of former Rep. Joe Kennedy III in a primary last year. Prerna Jagadeesh, a 22-year-old senior at UMass Amherst, was a fellow on Markey\u2019s campaign and an early supporter of Chang-D\u00edaz, who was the subject of an online campaign led by young progressives intent on drafting her into the race. \u201cI think Sonia is really the inheritor to the Ed Markey coalition because she and Ed both share that willingness to buck leadership in support of progressive ideals,\u201d Jagadeesh told CNN, a specific reference to Chang-D\u00edaz\u2019s long fight to pass the state\u2019s 2019 Student Opportunity Act, which guaranteed a new $1.5 billion in funding for K-12 public schools over seven years. Asked why she saw a winner in Chang-D\u00edaz, whose promise to unite and invigorate a progressive, multi-generational coalition has \u2013 in other campaigns, in other states and cities and congressional districts \u2013 met with mixed results, Jagadeesh offered a pointed case. \u201cWhat\u2019s different is that (Chang-D\u00edaz) is no backbencher, she\u2019s no granola hippie who just showed up on the political scene,\u201d Jagadeesh said. \u201cShe\u2019s been doing this work, she\u2019s been making these relationships, she\u2019s been fighting.\u201d Mara Dolan, a Democratic state committeewoman and co-founder of Left of Center, a women-run super PAC, praised the \u201coutstanding\u201d field of Democratic primary candidates, but said that Healey, despite being on the sidelines for now, would have a head start if she jumped in, having already been elected twice statewide. She also contended that Baker\u2019s well-documented popularity with Democrats was not as transferable, at least not under the current political conditions, to the voting booth as some believe \u2013 and that he is not immune to the nationalization of state and local politics, especially with the GOP leaders in places like Texas escalating their efforts to undermine voting rights laws and effectively ban abortion. \u201cDemocrats are going to vote for the Democratic nominee, Republicans are going to vote for the (Republican) nominee. In Massachusetts, though, it\u2019s more true that what\u2019s most important are the unenrolled voters, it\u2019s the centrist voters \u2013 they\u2019re the swing,\u201d Dolan said. \u201cThose voters are looking for someone who\u2019s going to lead on these really important national issues. And that\u2019s something that\u2019s good for Maura Healey, because she\u2019s been doing this all along.\u201d Baker could also face new pressure to tack right, or else risk an uncomfortably close primary race, if Diehl\u2019s campaign picks up momentum and forces him to stick or twist on Trump-era Republican red meat causes. \u201cWhether it will be on issues or just discussion of Trump or voter fraud, the things that Geoff Diehl will say are the things that Republican primary voters might want to hear,\u201d Koczela, the Massachusetts pollster, said. \u201cAnd the things that Charlie Baker will say are probably not those things. So it does set up a very interesting contrast, given that that\u2019s the contest he has to get to your first in order to get to the general.\u201d Baker, who has not yet made his intentions known, is steering clear of campaign chatter. \u201cRight now Governor Baker remains focused on leading the Commonwealth through the pandemic \u2013 not electoral politics,\u201d a senior adviser to governor told CNN. Still, there is some doubt among the progressives in the race now over the degree to which Baker\u2019s shared party affiliation with Trump will disadvantage him in a general election, should he seek a third term and secure re-nomination. In many ways, Massachusetts Democrats say, the dominant Trumpist faction of the GOP has been a boon to the moderate, technocratically disposed Republican \u2013 and that the eventual Democratic nominee will need to do more to connect with voters in the state\u2019s Gateway Cities and among those, across the state, who are increasingly focused on public transit issues and unrelenting traffic. \u201cDemocrats tried to connect Charlie Baker to national Republicans (in 2018) and say, \u2018He\u2019s one of them. You don\u2019t like them. Vote for us.\u2019 Well, Charlie Baker\u2019s not one of them,\u201d said Downing, who is running on an ambitious climate agenda. \u201cI have strong disagreements with Charlie Baker on policy, but he\u2019s not a national Republican. And the second that we as Democrats in Massachusetts try to turn (him) into that, voters disregard anything else that comes out of our mouth.\u201d The challenge of defeating Baker, or any other Republican nominee, Chang-D\u00edaz said, had in some ways been made more straightforward by the fallout from the coronavirus pandemic, which \u2013 as it has around the country \u2013 magnified inequities and frustrations, especially among working class and young voters, that had been papered over for generations. \u201cIf you are a relatively well-off resident of Massachusetts, you live in the right zip codes, you have access to various forms of power, it\u2019s really easy to want to believe that (things are better than they are),\u201d she said. \u201cAnd to let yourself be convinced that everything is OK. But this past year of pandemic and the beginnings of racial reckoning has really laid bare for people the depths of the problems that we have left to simmer for so long.\u201d Allen echoed the point, describing a \u201csplit screen economy\u201d that, in her view, was merging into a singular, more troubling picture as the pandemic makes it more difficult to ignore government\u2019s failings. \u201cWe\u2019ve all gotten used to settling,\u201d Allen said. \u201cWe\u2019ve gotten used to settling for less than we should be seeking.\u201d",

            "article_content": "A North Carolina state court panel on Friday blocked a voter identification law, citing discrimination against Black voters. The law, known as SB 824, was passed in 2018 after Republicans lost their supermajority in the legislature but before the new legislature took over. It was already on hold under a preliminary injunction, after North Carolina\u2019s Court of Appeals said voter ID provisions could negatively impact Black voters. But now the state court has permanently blocked the law, which required photo identification to vote. The majority of the three-judge panel said Friday that the law \u201cwas motivated at least in part by an unconstitutional intent to target African American voters.\u201d \u201cOther, less restrictive voter ID laws would have sufficed to achieve the legitimate nonracial purposes of implementing the constitutional amendment requiring voter ID, deterring fraud, or enhancing voter confidence,\u201d Superior Court Judges Michael O\u2019Foghludha and Vince Rozier wrote in their ruling Friday. The ruling, which comes as voting rights are under attack across the country, could still be appealed. In a statement, Southern Coalition for Social Justice co-executive director and chief counsel for voting rights Allison Riggs and pro bono counsel Andrew Ehrlich \u2013 attorneys who served on behalf of a group of North Carolina voters \u2013 said they \u201chope\u201d the ruling sent \u201ca strong message that racial discrimination will not be tolerated.\u201d The statement continued: \u201cToday\u2019s ruling striking down North Carolina\u2019s latest unconstitutional photo voter ID law is a testament to the overwhelming evidence, including compelling stories of disenfranchisement from voters themselves, which highlighted how the state\u2019s Republican-controlled legislature undeniably implemented this legislation to maintain its power by targeting voters of color.\u201d\u201c However, GOP leaders in North Carolina on Friday called the ruling \u201cpartisan,\u201d doubling down on the claim that voter IDs promote election security. \u201cFor all their talk about a secure democracy, the left, with an able assist from the judiciary, is doing their best to undermine it. Today, a partisan court blocked the will of a majority of North Carolinians who amended their Constitution to require photo voter ID,\u201d North Carolina state Sen. Paul Newton, a Republican, said in a statement. \u201cThe Republican-led legislature has made incredible strides to increase confidence in elections, and Democrats continue to use the judicial branch to thwart the will of the majority of North Carolinians. We will appeal this case,\u201d he said. After the ruling, Sam Hayes, general counsel for North Carolina House Speaker Tim Moore, also a Republican, said, \u201cThis fight is far from over.\u201d \u201cOnce again, liberal judges have defied the will of North Carolinians on election integrity. Voters of this state have repeatedly supported a voter ID requirement \u2013 going so far as to enshrine it in our state constitution. Senate Bill 824 is one of the most generous in the country, and it was modeled on those of other states. At trial, Plaintiffs could not produce a single witness who would be unable to vote because of the law,\u201d Hayes said in a statement. \u201cWe look forward to appealing this partisan ruling on behalf of the people of North Carolina,\u201d he added. In a statement, the plaintiffs\u2019 attorneys brushed off any potential appeal. \u201cShould legislative defendants appeal today\u2019s ruling, we\u2019ll be prepared to remind them of what this court and the state\u2019s constitution mandate: every vote matters,\u201d they said.",

            "article_content": "Update: CNN projects that Michelle Wu and Annissa Essaibi George will advance to the November general election. On Tuesday, Boston voters headed to the polls to decide which two candidates in this overwhelmingly Democratic city will move on to the November 2 general election. Which is how it\u2019s been every four years for a very long time. But this election promises something very different. Of the top five candidates, four are women of color and the fifth is a Black man. Which means that no matter what happens at the voting booth on Tuesday, Boston will elect its first non-White mayor in city history come November. Pretty amazing, right? For more perspective \u2013 and some political handicapping on the race \u2013 I reached out to my friend James Pindell, a political reporter at the Boston Globe. Our conversation, conducted via email and lightly edited for flow, is below. Cillizza: Let\u2019s talk about the obvious first. Four of the top five candidates are women of color. Was that a surprise for veteran Boston politicos? Pindell: This is a good place to start. If people around the United States wanted to sound smart about the Boston mayoral race and just use a single word to describe it, that word would be: \u201chistoric.\u201d Boston has held elections for mayor since 1822, before half of American states were even states. A White man has won every single election. In 2021, the four front-runners for Boston mayor are four women of color. A Black man is in fifth place. This historic change has driven the conversation about the race locally and nationally and rightly so. But was this a surprise for veteran Boston politicos? No, at least once it became clear that the previous mayor, Marty Walsh, would leave to serve as Biden\u2019s Labor Secretary. Even before Walsh got tapped by Biden, two council women of color (both had previously served as council president) were already running for mayor. Boston is a majority-minority city that last elected a Republican mayor 95 years ago and there is a hunger in the city for a diverse mayor. And a White person at that [stage] would have to enter a contest against two women of color who have stature already, and a Black woman who was the acting mayor and weeks from entering the contest herself. Cillizza: Is there a liberal vs. moderate dynamic playing out here? Or some other split or dynamic that differentiates the field? Pindell: Not really. There are ideological differences, but they are subtle. For example, affordable housing is a top issue in the election. One study found Boston is the second most expensive city to buy a home in the United States, behind San Francisco, but ahead of New York City. Before the pandemic, it was the third most expensive city to rent in, but apparently, it dropped to fifth last year. There is a sizable chunk of Boston residents who spend half of their income on housing. I mention this because it\u2019s the backdrop for probably the biggest difference in candidates: the woman topping the polls, Councilor Michelle Wu, a protege of Elizabeth Warren, wants rent control, while the others reject it for one reason or another. Note we aren\u2019t hotly debating other issues that fit neatly on the moderate/liberal scale such as defunding the police, tax cuts, reparations, Covid mandates, or other items you see debated in other city elections this year. Some in the media have tried to suss out that Councilor Annissa Essaibi George is a moderate given her strong backing from law enforcement. And her pitch is \u201cCommon Sense for Boston.\u201d At the same time, she doesn\u2019t really differentiate on issues except for the need to hire more cops, but even that isn\u2019t the main thrust of her campaign. She is no [New York City Democratic mayoral nominee] Eric Adams. She also notes she is the only candidate running who backed Ed Markey for Senate over Joe Kennedy last year. Cillizza: Many of these candidates rose through the Boston political class as a sort-of team. Has that affected the way the campaign has played out? Pindell: Totally. All four women front-runners are all city council members. Three have served as council presidents. The fifth, John Barros, was also part of the system as an aide in the Walsh administration. The point is that none of them are outsiders and none of them can really cast blame on a particular person. This is especially true since the items being discussed on the campaign trail are systemic (schools, racial justice, addiction, gentrification, climate resilience) that all candidates are, in a way, to blame for not fixing. In tone, the race has had some \u201cblunt elbows\u201d between candidates and Super PACs, but no fists. That they all have worked together for years is probably the biggest reason why. Cillizza: What is the general mood in Boston? Are voters happy with how things are going? Or is that a shake-up-the-status-quo election? Pindell: Despite the systemic issues mentioned above, this is not the classic definition of a change election. Boston has a world-class economy in terms of growth. In fact, it is undergoing the largest building boom in the city\u2019s history and neighborhoods have been transformed, especially including my own in South Boston. Voters aren\u2019t faced with bad choices, but instead about how to spend all this new property tax money and how to level out many inequities in the city, especially as it relates to race and class. Four years ago my colleagues at the Globe Spotlight team found the median net worth for a White Boston household was $247,000. For Black families, it was $8. [Note: This is not a typo.] Still, no one is in the mood to throw the bums out (though, again there is no outsider even offering that choice.) There is a sense that a different background leading the city could lead the city to change, but not wholesale change. Cillizza: Finish this sentence: \u201cThe two candidates MOST likely to advance to the general election in November are __________. \u201d Now, explain. Pindell: Given the state of the polling industry, I am hesitant to really go here. But the trendlines of several polls are clear on two points. First, Wu appears to have secured one of the two spots that will go on to the November run-off. Second, there is a three-way race for the other slot that is really too close to call. Those competing are Essaibi George, Acting Mayor Kim Janey and Councilor Andrea Campbell. I can make a compelling argument as to why all three can get second. But when we are talking about how you need just 25% support to move on, smarter people than me on this race, constantly point out that Essaibi George has her own set of voters. So I will take a stand and be willing to bet $5 on Essiabi George. (But not $10 dollars or $10,000 as some former Massachusetts politicians are willing to wage.) If that happens, the post-game analysis will be on how Janey, handed one of the biggest gifts in state politics in decades by being lucky on timing to be the acting mayor and during a pandemic, failed in a Martha Coakley way.",

            "article_content": "The man who was caught with a machete and bayonet-style knife near the Democratic Party headquarters was formally charged Tuesday, as more details emerge of his White supremacist ideology. US Capitol Police said they found Donald Craighead with the two weapons in his truck on Monday, and that the vehicle was outfitted with neo-Nazi symbols, including a swastika in the driver\u2019s-side mirror. During a brief court appearance Tuesday, he pleaded not guilty to one count of carrying a dangerous weapon outside the home. The charge is a felony and Craighead could receive up to five years in prison if he is convicted, though defendants often receive far less than the statutory maximum punishment. Affidavits from investigators contained new detail about the weapons. The machete was 21-inches long while the other knife, which police initially described as a \u201cbayonet\u201d on Monday, was actually a large hunting knife with a 7.5-inch blade. During the hearing, a defense attorney requested a psychological evaluation for Craighead. Investigators who interviewed Craighead said he appeared delusional and exhibited classic signs of mental illness. Craighead told investigators he only planned use the long knives for defensive purposes, according to notes of his voluntary interview. DC Superior Court Judge Lloyd Nolan ordered Craighead to stay in jail until his next hearing. Craighead, a bald White man, was handcuffed and flanked by US Marshals, and was wearing camouflage pants. Court documents unsealed Tuesday shed new light on Craighead\u2019s extremist views. Police officers said in a sworn affidavit that he said to them, \u201cWhy are you all pulling me over when there are brown people hurting White people.\u201d They also said he uttered anti-gay slurs about a prominent Hispanic author and that he blamed the LGBT community for the September 11 terrorist attacks. Police said in court filings that they found a handwritten inscription on the car that said, \u201cdeath to others, White power.\u201d He told investigators that he wasn\u2019t a member of any extremist groups, according to court filings. But police said he was wearing a shirt affiliated with the \u201cBoogaloo Boys\u201d when he was arrested, a violent far-right movement known for anti-government views and for trying to instigate a racial war in the US. Craighead told investigators he only planned use the long knives for defensive purposes, according to notes of his voluntary interview that were made public on Tuesday. National security officials have warned, with increasing alarm in recent months, of the threat posed by right-wing extremists and white nationalists. The Department of Homeland Security has said these extremists are being radicalized by disinformation about the 2020 election and the Covid-19 pandemic.",

            "article_content": "A few months before rioters stormed the US Capitol, the Department of Homeland Security restricted the flow of open-source intelligence reports about \u201celection-related threats\u201d to law enforcement, citing First Amendment concerns, according to documents reviewed by CNN. The revelations not only add to a growing concerns about intelligence gathering, but they also raise questions about a key staffer on the committee investigating the insurrection and his previous role in determining how threat information that came from public sources, was shared with law enforcement prior to the Capitol attack. Joseph Maher, who changed the protocols around disseminating open-source information as head of DHS\u2019 intelligence arm, is now on the staff of the House Select Committee on January 6. That committee has a broad mandate that includes examining why authorities were caught so off-guard by the violence that unfolded at the Capitol \u2013 especially considering law enforcement was aware but ultimately chose not to act on a significant number of warning signs on social media and elsewhere in the public sphere. In a memo dated October 30, 2020, Maher informed DHS officials that all open-source intelligence reports on election-related threats must be approved by DHS leadership and legal counsel prior to release, according to the documents, which were provided to CNN by the Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington. \u201cBecause of the very real concerns about apparent failures to disseminate and act on intelligence in the leadup to the January 6 insurrection, this memo raises important questions about the intent behind the change, the origins of it, and the effect this policy change had on intelligence dissemination,\u201d said Noah Bookbinder, president of CREW watchdog group. \u201cThe January 6 select committee should consider these questions.\u201d Temporary fencing to surround Capitol ahead of September 18 right-wing rally Maher did not respond to a request for comment. The select committee has defended Maher in response to criticism about his handling of intelligence related to domestic extremists while at DHS. But when asked about the October memo, a spokesperson for the bipartisan panel, Tim Mulvey, told CNN that Maher is \u201crecused from any Select Committee matters dealing with DHS\u201d in light of his prior service at DHS and committee policy. \u201cAll members of the Select Committee staff are required to identify areas where a potential personal or organizational conflict of interest may exist, and staff leadership is taking affirmative steps to screen for such conflicts. Any staff member deemed or determined to have an actual conflict or the appearance of a conflict will disclose and recuse themselves from such matters,\u201d he said in a statement. Maher\u2019s October memo also reveals new details on how DHS balanced free speech and the increasingly violent rhetoric surrounding the presidential election last year. Maher noted that there would likely be an increase in open-source intel reports on these issues, and that he was not imposing limits on collecting the intel. But he said such reports would need to go through a \u201cpre-release review.\u201d \u201cWe anticipate that the period leading up to, including, and immediately following the presidential election on 3 November may give rise to physical violence, civil unrest, and other threats related to the election,\u201d Maher wrote. January 6 select committee refutes claim by McCarthy that the Justice Department cleared Trump of any role in insurrection \u201cAt the same time, we recognize that this mission space carries sensitivities and complexities that are not always anticipated or that do not lend themselves to bright line advance guidance,\u201d he added. \u201cCivil unrest and election- or voter-related issues often invoke U.S. Persons and First Amendment-protected activity.\u201d As a result, Maher \u201ccreated additional levels of review before intelligence reports about election-related civil unrest could be sent out to other parts of the government,\u201d according to Bookbinder. Since his hiring was announced by the select committee earlier this year, critics have questioned how Maher can objectively help investigate failures around the dissemination of intelligence on election-related threats and domestic extremists considering they occurred under his leadership. While the October memo provides one of the first concrete examples of how Maher changed department policy in his previous role at DHS, the specific impact of this shift remains unclear. Law enforcement officials who have testified about the security failures around January 6 have pointed the finger at DHS, along with other agencies, as they described the intelligence sharing breakdowns that took place prior to the attack. In February, former US Capitol Police Chief Steven Sund alleged that the FBI, US Secret Service, Department of Homeland Security and the DC Metropolitan Police Department failed to anticipate violence on that day, though he said it was reasonable to rely on that intelligence since earlier pro-Trump rallies had been similarly assessed and ended up not being violent. \u201cThe entire intelligence community seems to have missed this,\u201d he wrote. On January 3, an assessment of the upcoming protests indicated it was \u201cexpected to be similar to the previous Million MAGA March rallies in November and December 2020, which drew tens of thousands of participants,\u201d Sund wrote in his letter to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. The assessment indicated that the far-right Proud Boys and far-left Antifa groups were expected at the Capitol on the January 6 and \u201cmay be inclined to become violent.\u201d A day later, the US Capitol Police\u2019s daily intelligence report assessed the risk of violence at these events as either \u201cremote\u201d or \u201cimprobable,\u201d according to Sund\u2019s letter. That day\u2019s report noted \u201cthe Secretary of Homeland Security has not issued an elevated or imminent alert at this time.\u201d CNN previously reported that the DHS intelligence division did not issue a specific warning about the possibility of violence on January 6, according to two DHS officials, but did author and disseminate several assessments highlighting potential threats surrounding election season. A bipartisan Senate report examining security failures around January 6 also stated that DHS Office of Intelligence and Analysis, which Maher led in the months leading up to the attack, \u201cnever produced an intelligence product, bulletin, or warning specific to the January 6 Joint Session of Congress.\u201d \u201cOne I&A official informed the Committees that he was \u2018not aware of any known direct threat to the Capitol before January 6,\u2019 despite many online posts mentioning violence,\u201d the report adds. \u201cIn briefings with the committees, I&A officials highlighted the difficulty in discerning credible threats from online bravado and constitutionally protected speech, which limits its collection capabilities.\u201d In March, Maher\u2019s successor, DHS acting intelligence chief Melissa Smislova acknowledged that \u201cmore should have been done\u201d to understand the threat of violence ahead of the US Capitol attack, pointing to \u201cconcerning information\u201d that was evaluated in the weeks prior. That breakdown is well within the scope of the select committee\u2019s investigation. Earlier this month, the committee demanded that DHS hand over \u201call documents and communications pertaining to rules, regulations, procedures, or policies that restrict monitoring or reporting related to First Amendment protected activities.\u201d It also requested \u201call documents and communications pertaining to agency review, collection, or dissemination of social media evidence in the 6 months prior to January 6, 2021, relating to events that could or ultimately did transpire on January 6, 2021.\u201d While it remains unclear if the October memo was included in the initial batch of documents DHS says it delivered to the committee last week, its relevance to the probe has fueled questions about Maher\u2019s role on the panel\u2019s staff considering he was in charge of DHS\u2019 intelligence arm for several months until late January. \u201cMaher was in charge. So how can he be a staffer on the Committee investigating whether I&A failed in its job?\u201d asked Mark Zaid, an attorney representing DHS whistleblower Brian Murphy, who served in the same role at DHS until summer 2020. Separately, Murphy has alleged Maher was among the officials who retaliated against him, leading to his demotion. A source close to the select committee probe also told CNN that Maher\u2019s hiring created \u201cbad optics,\u201d and that his previous role at DHS could result in questions about conflicts of interest as the investigation progresses. Maher, who at the time was DHS\u2019 principal deputy general counsel, was installed last summer to lead the intelligence office amid a First Amendment controversy and management shakeup. As the department surged personnel to Portland, Oregon, to assist with the sometimes-violent protests for racial justice and police accountability, a report was published detailing how the Office of Intelligence and Analysis had compiled intelligence reports about the work of two US journalists covering the protests. The revelation prompted public backlash and Murphy\u2019s dismissal. After that report, acting Homeland Security Secretary Chad Wolf also directed the intelligence branch to cease collecting information on US members of the media and ordered a review of the incident. Wolf later told lawmakers that there were three instances of information being distributed as part of the DHS \u201cOpen Source Reporting Program\u201d that identified members of the press. Murphy would later file a whistleblower complaint alleging top political appointees in the Department of Homeland Security repeatedly instructed career officials to modify intelligence assessments to suit President Donald Trump\u2019s agenda by downplaying the threat posed by White supremacists, as CNN first reported last year. The select committee has defended Maher in response to criticism about his handling of intelligence related to domestic extremists while at DHS but declined to comment on the whistleblower retaliation allegations levied by Murphy, noting an inspector general investigation in that case is still ongoing. \u201cThe Select Committee has no reason to believe that Mr. Maher is the focus of this probe and it would be inappropriate for the Select Committee to comment on an ongoing IG review,\u201d the committee spokesperson told CNN. \u201cMr. Maher believes that any allegations implicating him are entirely baseless, that he did not retaliate in any way against anyone.\u201d CNN\u2019s Geneva Sands contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Only Donald Trump knows whether he will mount a run for the White House in 2024. But it\u2019s already clear what such a campaign would look like. It would be built on a lie that he was cheated out of office and would relentlessly politicize and monetize America\u2019s ideological, social and racial divides. As a political neophyte in 2016, Trump tapped into a seam of discontent with the economy and a sense that the Washington establishment was ignoring millions of people. His victimization of Mexican and Muslim immigrants in that campaign played on a fear of outsiders. Some Democrats believe his win was also born from a racist backlash to the country\u2019s first Black commander-in-chief that benefited from his racist and false accusations about ex-President Barack Obama\u2019s birthplace. Already, what looks like a new attempt by Trump to reclaim the White House is shaping up as an even more sinister affair, not least because a twice-impeached President who already incited an insurrection and tried to subvert US democracy to stay in office would be seeking to regain the awesome powers of the presidency. In the wake of Trump's attack on democracy, election officials fear for the future of American elections In recent days, Trump has appeared to sense an opening, with President Joe Biden heavily criticized over his chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan and with the pandemic resurgent, to accelerate his own political aspirations. The former President hasn\u2019t offered any political plans or useful suggestions, for example, of how to tackle the country\u2019s greatest crisis \u2013 the Covid-19 emergency that he so badly botched while in office. Rather his statements and attacks most often suggest that a new presidential campaign would be a vehicle for personal vengeance and the wounded vanity of being rejected by voters after a single term. That was clear this weekend when the country solemnly marked the 20th anniversary of the September 11, 2001, attacks and the former President unleashed a string of political assaults on his successor. There was something rather sad that the most recent ex-President felt unable to join Biden and ex-Presidents Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Obama at official commemorations of the attacks. Trump has never been interested in being a member of the ex-President\u2019s club. And his political brand as an outsider often relies on attacking pillars of the establishment like former Presidents. But his absence underscored gaping divides in a nation that is now unable to even join as one to mark the most unifying event in modern history: the national response to the terrorist attacks that killed nearly 3,000 people. Trump did visit police officers and fire fighters in New York City on Saturday after being criticized for avoiding national observances and for later moonlighting as a commentator at a boxing match. But even then he could not risk political digs, boasting about his previous campaign and his administration, lying that the election in 2020 was \u201crigged\u201d and delivering a broad hint that he would mount another presidential campaign. \u201cI know what I am going to do, but we are not supposed to be talking about it yet from the standpoint of campaign finance laws,\u201d Trump told a questioner, before adding, \u201cI think you are going to be happy, let me put it that way. I think you are going to be very happy.\u201d The former President also savaged Biden over the withdrawal from Afghanistan \u2013 a subject that is worthy of debate and critiques but perhaps not on a day devoted to memorializing the victims of the 2001 attacks. \u201cI hate to talk about it on this day,\u201d Trump said, but then launched into a prolonged attack on Biden and claimed that had he been in charge, the situation would have been different \u2013 even though he set the stage for the pullout by capitulating to the Taliban\u2019s withdrawal demands in a deal with the group. Those waiting for Trump to behave with decorum or to become \u201cpresidential\u201d have long since been disappointed. But his conduct in recent days has been radical even for an ex-President who spent four years tearing down the conventions of the presidency and political and legal norms. While Obama, Clinton, Bush and Biden attended official 9/11 events, Trump spent his time sending out a flurry of political statements. \u201cThis is the 20th year of this war and should have been a year of victory, honor, and strength. Instead, Joe Biden and his inept administration surrendered in defeat,\u201d Trump said in one, sent through his political action committee. \u201cWe will live on, but sadly our Country will be wounded for a long period of time. We will struggle to recover from the embarrassment this incompetence has caused,\u201d the former President wrote. Trump\u2019s defenders may point out that Bush delivered a politicized speech at the memorial site in Pennsylvania dedicated to victims of the fourth hijacked airliner on 9/11 that was brought down when heroic passengers stormed the cockpit. But Bush was defending democracy \u2013 not attacking it as Trump did for much of Saturday. The 43rd President compared domestic violent extremists to the hijackers of 9/11 and clearly drew an analogy between the attacks and the storming of Congress by Trump supporters on January 6 that followed a rally by the outgoing and defeated president. \u201cThere is little cultural overlap between violent extremists abroad and violent extremists at home,\u201d Bush said. \u201cBut in their disdain for pluralism, in their disregard for human life, in their determination to defile national symbols, they are children of the same foul spirit.\u201d Far from confronting such extremism, as Bush counseled, Trump is still seeking to co-opt it, not just with his lies about election fraud that have convinced millions of people but also in its continued weaponization of race. His attacks on the integrity of the 2020 election have left millions of his supporters believing a general election that even Trump\u2019s own Justice Department said did not contain serious corruption was stolen. This is not only a grave threat to faith in the US political system, it is an important part of what it means to be a Republican in 2021. A new CNN poll published Sunday found that about six in ten of Republicans and Republican-leaning independents believed that supporting Trump and believing that he won in 2020 are at least a somewhat important part of identifying with the party. The ex-President\u2019s power in the GOP \u2013 which means he would be a prohibitive favorite in any new campaign for its nomination \u2013 can be witnessed in the way candidates who wish to have his endorsement must buy into his false claims of election fraud. Those who tell the truth about what happened in November 2020 and the Capitol insurrection \u2014 like Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney \u2013 are likely to find themselves with Trump-backed primary races. The House Republican Conference under its leader Rep. Kevin McCarthy has become a wing of the Trump political movement, embracing his falsehoods about the election, whitewashing history and adopting his authoritarian conservatism. Some of Trump\u2019s most damaging behavior comes when he weaponizes race in the service of his political goals. In a statement last week, for instance, the former President condemned authorities in Richmond, Virginia \u2013 the capital of the Confederacy during the Civil War \u2013 over the removal of a statue honoring Gen. Robert E. Lee, the Confederate general who took up arms against the United States in a war to defend slavery. \u201cOur culture is being destroyed and our history and heritage, both good and bad, are being extinguished by the Radical Left, and we can\u2019t let that happen!\u201d the former President wrote. It was not the first time Trump had defended the Confederacy. He did so in the 2020 campaign when he seized on the removal of statues to racist historical figures to fuel the fears of those of his voters who fear their traditional White culture is being overwhelmed as part of the country\u2019s growing diversity. Trump\u2019s belief that Lee was a great general is also challenged by history \u2013 and he appeared to unintentionally expose himself to criticism by arguing that had Lee commanded troops in Afghanistan, \u201cthat disaster would have ended in a complete and total victory many years ago.\u201d Of course, the commander in chief who ran that war from 2017 until January was none other than Trump himself. Trump\u2019s statements lack the immediacy and platform that he enjoyed as president, partly because his insurrectionist rhetoric caused him to be kicked off social media platforms. But they are relayed by his spokespeople and supporters on Twitter and Facebook. The ex-President also appears to have an open invitation for softball interviews with Fox News opinion hosts. Some of his most notable interventions in recent days have occurred as he highlighted the anguish of several parents of the 13 US service personnel killed in a suicide bombing last month outside Kabul airport who support him and criticized Biden. In normal circumstances, it would be more than appropriate for a former President to comfort those mourning the fallen. But Trump has done it in politicized statements that leave the impression that he is exploiting their grief. This adds to a growing impression \u2013 evident in his mismanagement of the pandemic when he trashed public health advice and throughout his presidency \u2013 that there is nothing that the former President will not do in support of his personal goals, including in a possible new bid for the White House.",

            "article_content": "Most Republicans want former President Donald Trump to remain their party\u2019s leader, according to a new CNN poll conducted by SSRS. But differing views about Trump\u2019s role in the party \u2013 and his strength as a future presidential nominee \u2013 highlight divides within the GOP. Republicans and Republican-leaning independents say, 63% to 37%, that Trump should be the leader of the Republican Party. But they are about evenly split over whether having the defeated former President back on the ticket in 2024 would be an advantage: 51% say that Republicans have a better chance of retaking the presidency if Trump is the nominee, with 49% saying the party would be better off with a different nominee. That\u2019s a very different landscape from 2019, when more than three-quarters of Republicans said their party had a better shot in 2020 with Trump as their nominee than they would with a different candidate. Americans turn pessimistic amid concerns over economy and coronavirus Trump\u2019s support isn\u2019t equally distributed throughout the party: 69% of Republicans without a college degree think Trump should head the party, compared with 49% of those who hold a college degree. A 72% majority of conservatives say Trump should head the party, compared to 49% among the smaller bloc of moderates in the party. And 71% of self-identified Republicans want Trump to lead the party, compared with 51% of Republican-leaning independents who say the same. Most Republicans also consider support for Trump \u2013 and his false claim to have won the 2020 election \u2013 to be an important part of their own partisan identity alongside support for conservative principles. About six in 10 say that supporting Trump, and that believing that he won in 2020, are at least a somewhat important part of what being a Republican means to them. More, though, point to more traditional partisan markers, with 69% saying it\u2019s at least somewhat important to oppose Democratic policies, 81% to support the Republicans in Congress, 85% to hold conservative values and positions and 86% to believe the federal government should have less power. Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents are most likely to tie their identity as Democrats to support for progressive policies and more government aid, the most recent poll finds. Perhaps reflecting their status as the party currently in power, they\u2019re less likely than Republicans to place emphasis on opposing the other party: 58% say that, as Democrats, it\u2019s at least somewhat important to oppose GOP policies, 77% to support Biden, 81% to support Democrats in Congress, 84% to hold progressive positions and 93% to believe that the federal government should do more to help people. On the Democratic side, the sharpest divisions come along generational and racial lines. Democrats and Democratic-leaning independents over age 45, for instance, are 28 percentage points likelier than their younger counterparts to call supporting Biden very important, and 22 points likelier to say supporting congressional Democrats is very important. Black Democrats are 14 points likelier than White Democrats to say supporting Biden is very important. And Democrats of color are 12 points likelier than White Democrats to say it\u2019s very important that the federal government should do more to help people. Liberal Democrats are likelier than moderates to place high importance on holding progressive policies (by 32 points), opposing the GOP (14 points), favoring an expanded role for the federal government (14 points), and backing congressional Democrats (12 points), but show far less of a divide over the importance of standing behind Biden (3 points). Both Democrats and Republicans are currently satisfied with the ideological positions their own parties are staking out. The vast majority of Republicans, 86%, call the GOP mainstream; on the flip side, 92% of Democrats see their party as mainstream, and 96% say the same of Biden. Americans are closely split in their views of the Republican Party, with 51% calling it too extreme and 49% saying it\u2019s generally mainstream. They say, 54% to 45%, that the Democratic Party is generally mainstream. Just 14% of Americans view both the Democratic Party and the Republican Party as too extreme. Another 31% say only the Democrats are too extreme, with 37% saying only the Republicans are, and 17% seeing both parties as generally mainstream. Biden is seen as more mainstream than his party as a whole: 61% say he is generally mainstream, compared to 39% who call him too extreme. Between 2010 and 2013, the share of the public that called Democrats too extreme in CNN/ORC polling stood around four in 10, while the share that said the same about the GOP generally rose over that time to a high of 56%. Looking ahead to next year\u2019s congressional elections, the poll finds early preferences on a generic ballot are about evenly split, with 45% of registered voters saying they\u2019d vote for the Democratic Party\u2019s candidate, and 44% that they\u2019d vote for the Republican Party\u2019s candidate. Overall, 28% of voters say they\u2019re extremely enthusiastic about voting for Congress next year, higher than the 18% who reported similar excitement in September 2017, one year ahead of the last midterm elections. Republican-leaning voters are slightly more enthusiastic about casting ballots in next year\u2019s contest than are Democratic-leaning voters (30% on the Republican side, 26% on the Democratic side), and within both parties, those with the strongest ideological leanings are most enthusiastic (38% of very liberal Democratic voters and 44% of very conservative Republican voters say they are extremely enthusiastic). But where Democrats are broadly happy with their current leadership in Congress, Republicans \u2013 especially those with weak ties to the party \u2013 are less satisfied. Most self-identified Republicans, 58%, approve of their party\u2019s congressional leadership. But among independents who lean toward the Republican Party, that number falls sharply to 29%. By contrast, 83% of Democrats approve of their party\u2019s congressional leadership, as do 69% of Democratic-leaning independents. Overall, Americans disapprove of Democratic congressional leaders by a 10-percentage point margin, 55% to 45%, and disapprove of the Republican leaders by a wider 38-point margin, 69% to 31%. That\u2019s a shift from 2019, when CNN polling found both parties\u2019 congressional leaders with identically low ratings. The new CNN poll was conducted by SSRS August 3 through September 7 online and by telephone among a random sample of 2,119 adults recruited from an address-based sample.",

            "article_content": "The 2013 Supreme Court ruling that gutted the Voting Rights Act still finds new ways to scramble the Justice Department\u2019s enforcement of the landmark 1965 law. As legislation that restores a key element of the law makes its way toward a likely Senate GOP filibuster, the Justice Department is heading into the first redistricting cycle in a half century without the Voting Rights Act\u2019s so-called preclearance requirement. At stake is whether millions of minority voters will have their political power protected from certain racial gerrymanders in elections ranging from local school boards all the way up to US congressional seats. Justice Department civil rights chief calls on Congress to pass voting rights bill The preclearance requirement mandated that states or localities with a history of racial voting discrimination get federal approval \u2013 either from the Justice Department or a court in DC \u2013 for election policy changes, including the legislative maps that are redrawn every 10 years. While only a part of the country was covered by the requirement, the process brought transparency to how maps were being redrawn in several large states in the South, like Georgia and Texas, as well as in parts of New York and California. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a mess for the Department of Justice,\u201d William Yeomans, a former acting assistant attorney general for civil rights who now lectures at Columbia Law School, told CNN. \u201cI know they will do their best, but they really are handicapped by the loss of preclearance.\u201d For the first time in decades, the department will in some ways be starting from scratch in understanding whether voters of color are being discriminated against in redistricting. \u201cWhere previously you had the ability of the Justice Department to gather the information, and process it, and make determinations in a timely and resource-efficient manner, that is certainly lost,\u201d said Terry Ao Minnis, the senior director of the census and voting programs for Asian Americans Advancing Justice - AAJC. The onset of the next redistricting cycle has created \u201cadded urgency\u201d for Congress to revive the requirement, Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke told Congress last month. Census Bureau releases population data, starting scramble to redraw congressional lines The Justice Department \u201cwill not have access to maps and other redistricting-related information from many jurisdictions where there is reason for concern, even though this kind of information is necessary to assess where voting rights are being restricted or inform how the department directs its limited enforcement resources,\u201d said Clarke, who leads the department\u2019s civil rights division. The Supreme Court\u2019s 2013 ruling in Shelby County v. Holder opened the floodgates to a wave of restrictive voting laws in previously covered states. Now in those states, map-drawers will be delineating districts without the Justice Department or a federal court looking over their shoulders. This preclearance requirement had a deterrence effect on map-drawers, legal experts say. Not only did legislatures know that those regimes would be scrutinized closely by the federal government, but the burden also was on the map-drawers to prove to the department that their new districts would not adversely affect the ability of minority communities to elect the candidates of their choice. In reviewing maps in the covered states, the department would invite members of those communities to weigh in on whether they should be approved. John Roberts and the Supreme Court might block anything Democrats do on voting rights Now, Clarke said in her written testimony last month, the absence of preclearance means there will be \u201cless incentive\u201d for those jurisdictions to get community input on election rule changes, and local communities will have \u201cless insight into the electoral process and the process of making voting changes.\u201d The deterrence effect extended beyond just the covered states, said Thomas Saenz, the president of the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund. Because the department made its determinations public when it concluded that a map had violated the Voting Rights Act, those objection letters sent a signal to the non-covered jurisdictions what tactics might earn a legal response. While only the jurisdictions in about a dozen fully or partially covered states had to go through preclearance before the Shelby County ruling, the entire nation is subject to the Voting Rights Act\u2019s broader protections for minority voters and could face lawsuits for maps that violate the law. \u201cIf you\u2019re doing something similar, then even if you\u2019re not in a covered situation you should pause, and consider whether you want to go through with it, because the risk you will be sued by a private party or the government is pretty high at that point,\u201d Saenz said. The cases implicating US congressional districts or state legislative maps attract much of the national attention, but the bulk of Voting Rights Act enforcement has historically happened on an extremely local level, in places where school board districts and parish lines are alleged to have violated the law. Private minority rights groups that monitor redistricting will now to pay more attention to those extremely local maps, Saenz said, because local jurisdictions that no longer have to go through the Justice Department review process may believe they can fly under the radar with discriminatory maps and not get caught. The Justice Department released guidance last week reminding jurisdictions of their obligations to comply with the Voting Rights Act in redistricting. The law prohibits intentional discrimination in redistricting, as well as line-drawing that has the effect of diluting the votes of minorities. While its preclearance provision is not in effect, the department can still bring proactive lawsuits against noncompliant jurisdictions under a Voting Rights Act provision known as Section 2. It can also file briefs in support of private groups that bring Section 2 cases. John Roberts takes aim at the Voting Rights Act and political money disclosures, again A Justice Department official told reporters that the department has been preparing for the coming redistricting cycle for \u201csome time.\u201d It could use \u201cpublic records requests or other formal requests from the department for maps, if we are not able to get them in the public sphere,\u201d the official \u2013 whose anonymity the department requested as a condition of the call \u2013 told reporters. Getting that detailed information about a state\u2019s maps is a more complicated endeavor than it may seem. For instance, to analyze whether a map is Voting Rights Act-compliant, one needs to look at past election results, often at the precinct level, and not every state offers such information in a single database, according to Kathay Feng, the national redistricting director for the voting rights group Common Cause. \u201cYou would have to go to each county, and each county would give it to you in a slightly different format, and you have to figure out how that all could be put together,\u201d Feng said As it has waited for the restricting process to start in earnest, the Justice Department has looked at data from the American Community Survey, the department official said, to identify potential hot spots, based on where the largest demographic shifts in the country occurred. \u201cWe are doing our best to anticipate where there may be issues, but based on past experience from past decades, things will come up that we will have to \u2013 not necessarily things that were anticipated,\u201d the Justice Department official said. The pandemic-related delays the Census Bureau faced in getting out its 2020 data \u2013 the redistricting numbers were released about five months late \u2013 are throwing another wrench into the process, as there will be a real time crunch in some states between when the post-2020 maps are released and when the electoral calendar gets underway. The census delays aside, preclearance created an incentive for covered jurisdictions to submit their maps with enough time for the full Justice Department review that would be needed before they could go into effect for the next election cycle. That will likely change now that Section 2 lawsuits are the only tool for blocking noncompliant maps, Nathaniel Persily, a Stanford Law School professor and redistricting expert, told CNN. \u201cIf you are a gerrymanderer, you are going to wait until the last minute,\u201d Persily said.

            "article_content": "Two prominent election lawyers have joined forces to launch a network that will provide free legal assistance to election officials who have faced unprecedented threats during and after the 2020 election. Democrat Bob Bauer, former White House counsel in the Obama administration, and Ben Ginsberg, a leading Republican election lawyer who represented President George W. Bush\u2019s campaign, on Wednesday announced the creation of the Election Official Legal Defense Network. The group will help election officials with a range of issues \u2013 from protecting themselves and their families against threats to navigating partisan subpoenas and a raft of new state laws that impose criminal and civil penalties on election officials who fail to comply with their provisions. The network will be managed by an existing non-profit group, the nonpartisan Center for Election Innovation & Research. \u201cWe see now, still to this day, death threats and other threats being targeted at the professional election officials at the state and local level, and even their families now, even though we are almost a year past the election,\u201d David Becker, the center\u2019s director, told reporters Wednesday. Ginsberg said the new network will send a message to election officials: \u201cNo. 1, you are not alone, and No. 2, we have your backs.\u201d During a virtual news conference, Brian Corley, a Republican who runs elections in Pasco County, Florida, said he and his staff had been threatened repeatedly last year after his office encouraged residents to consider voting by mail during the coronavirus pandemic. \u201cMy staff was called racial slurs, not just once or twice. \u2026 We are talking 30, 40, 50,\u201d he said. \u201cI was called an enemy of the state.\u201d Corley said the problems only escalated after he spoke up publicly against the threats last December \u2013 with angry protesters showing up at his former home, where his former wife and child still lived. He said he ended up seeking help from local law enforcement and the FBI. Election watchers have expressed alarm for months about the threats that officials face and the potential for a mass exodus from the field. Nearly 1 in 3 local election officials included in a recent survey for the liberal-leaning Brennan Center for Justice say they feel unsafe because of their jobs. The problem is so serious that the US Justice Department earlier this year announced a task force to address the rise in threats against election officials. Fulton County, Georgia, Elections Director Richard Barron said Wednesday on CNN that the continuous threats lodged against members of his staff and him had prompted a meeting with the FBI. He detailed some of the threats during an interview on \u201cErin Burnett OutFront.\u201d \u201cA lot of the calls\u00a0dealt with motorcycle gangs on\u00a0their way to our offices, to\u00a0shoot us all in our offices and\u00a0seats.\u00a0A couple members of\u00a0my staff were visited at home by\u00a0people at night at their\u00a0doorway,\u201d he said.\u00a0\u201cAnother lady had her grandma\u00a0visited because they thought she\u00a0was there.\u00a0They\u00a0wanted to make a citizen\u2019s arrest\u00a0and tried to push their way into\u00a0her grandmother\u2019s house.\u201d Officials say they also worry about penalties in new election laws passed this year in Republican-controlled states. A new Florida law imposes a fine of up to $25,000 on election officials who leave ballot drop boxes unsupervised. And a Texas law signed this week by Republican Gov. Greg Abbott establishes criminal and civil penalties for election workers who run afoul of its provisions. The Texas law, for example, grants new access and powers to partisan poll watchers and makes it a crime to knowingly obstruct a poll watcher\u2019s view. \u201cWe just passed another law that\u2019s going to make things more contentious in the polling place,\u201d Michael Winn, who served as elections director in Harris County, Texas, said of the new poll-watching provisions. Winn and Corley are part of a bipartisan advisory board for the new network that also includes Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, a Republican who rebuffed former President Donald Trump\u2019s entreaty to \u201cfind\u201d the votes needed to overturn his 2020 loss in the Peach State. Becker said the group has just started its effort to recruit lawyers who will provide pro bono help to election officials.

            "article_content": "A pro-Chinese government online influence operation is targeting Americans in an effort to exploit divisions over the Covid-19 pandemic and \u201cphysically mobilize protestors in the US in response,\u201d according to a new report from cybersecurity firm Mandiant and experts at Google. The operation, which initially attempted to discredit pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong in 2019, has expanded into a \u201cglobal campaign that\u2019s operating in seven languages, on at least 30 social media platforms and across 40+ website & forums,\u201d experts at Mandiant and Google say, noting parallels to the Russian disinformation campaign around the 2016 presidential election. US officials believe the operation is linked to the Chinese government and have been monitoring its evolution, according to one source familiar with the situation. During the 2020 election, US officials were watching to see if the operation might be used to spread disinformation but ultimately assessed that the Chinese government avoided doing so because it did not want to provoke a response, the source added. Months later, experts have observed an \u201cexplosion of activity\u201d across the world and the move to make physical protests happen in the US \u201cdemonstrates they are a very serious threat,\u201d Mandiant Threat Intelligence Vice President John Hulquist told CNN. As the WHO investigated coronavirus origins in China, Beijing pushed a conspiracy about the US \u201cThis direct call for physical mobilization is a significant development compared to prior activity, potentially indicative of an emerging intent to motivate real-world activity outside of China\u2019s territories,\u201d the report says. \u201cWhile this attempt did not appear to achieve any success, we believe it is critical that observers continue to monitor for such attempts in case greater degrees of organic engagement are later realized by the network.\u201d In April for example, experts saw thousands of fake accounts calling on Asian Americans to protest racial injustice in the US and \u201cdisinformation about the virus\u2019 origins.\u201d While experts found no evidence these posts were successful in mobilizing protesters, the report says \u201cit does provide early warning that the actors behind the activity may be starting to explore, in however limited a fashion, more direct means of influencing the domestic affairs of the US.\u201d While there has been limited engagement with these pro-Chinese accounts, the operation\u2019s massive scope shows the actors responsible have \u201csignificantly expanded their online footprint and appear to be attempting to establish a presence on as many platforms as possible to reach a variety of global audiences,\u201d according to Mandiant\u2019s experts. \u201cOver the past two years, we have seen this threat actor evolve, from the types of content they publish to the tactics they use to amplify it. However the most significant features of this network remain its scale and persistence, in spite of low engagement levels. That is why we\u2019ve taken an aggressive approach to identifying and removing disinformation from this network,\u201d Shane Huntley, Director of Google\u2019s Threat Analysis Group, said. \u201cWe anticipate they will continue to experiment to drive higher engagement and encourage others in the community to continue tracking this actor, shedding light on their operations and taking action against them,\u201d he added. Cyber espionage from China against the United States has spiked since the Covid-19 outbreak began and Beijing has consistently sought to shape the global narrative through overt and covert means. For months, Chinese officials have overtly spread false and misleading information about the virus and its origins. Twitter disputes State Department claims China coordinated coronavirus disinformation accounts But the US and several of its European allies have also been more cautious in attributing disinformation and other malicious cyber activity to China than it has other state actors, namely Russia and Iran in recent years. When pressed on the issue In May 2020, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen denied allegations that the EU watered down a report on coronavirus disinformation after being pressured from China. While experts at Mandiant and Google say they have not seen these specific pro-Chinese accounts wade into election specific content to date, they did warn that the actors responsible could be gearing up for a more expansive disinformation push that could very well be conducted in a similar way to Moscow\u2019s campaign to meddle in the 2016 US election. with similar intent to what US intelligence agencies said was deployed by Moscow during the 2016 race. Beijing isn\u2019t the only US adversary linked with sweeping online efforts to undermine confidence in democratic institutions. German officials on Monday blamed Russia\u2019s GRU military intelligence agency for a hacking campaign targeting politicians ahead of Germany\u2019s general election in September. The same hacking group has also gone after US allies such as Poland with false narratives about NATO, according to researchers. CNN\u2019s Sean Lyngaas contributed reporting.",

            "article_content": "For the first time in 2022, members of Generation Z \u2013 those born after 1996 \u2013 could be elected to the US House of Representatives. While Maxwell Frost, a Florida Democrat, and Karoline Leavitt, a New Hampshire Republican, stand on opposite sides of the political spectrum, the two share a common belief that it\u2019s time to elect more young people to office. With the midterm elections on the horizon, both Frost and Leavitt are ramping up their campaigns to be the first member of Gen Z in Congress. \u201cI\u2019m running for what our generation really wants and is asking for,\u201d said Frost, a 24-year-old gun violence prevention activist who spent the summer of 2020 on the frontlines of protests for racial justice following the death of George Floyd. \u201cWe often talk about what we need to survive. I want to have a conversation about what we need to thrive,\u201d said Frost, who previously served as the national organizing director for March For Our Lives \u2013 the gun violence prevention organization founded in the wake of the Parkland school shooting in 2018 \u2013 and as a field manager with the American Civil Liberties Union of Florida. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t have to worry about whether or not a trip to the hospital will bankrupt us, we shouldn\u2019t fear gun violence and dying, and we deserve clean water,\u201d he said. Members of the House must be at least 25-years-old, according to the US Constitution. Frost \u2013 who turns 25 in January, qualifying his run for office in 2022 \u2013 is running in Florida\u2019s 10th Congressional District for the seat currently held by Democratic Rep. Val Demings. Demings, who won her House seat with 63.6% of the vote in 2020, earlier this year announced her run for US Senate. Over 1,000 miles North, Leavitt, a 24-year-old conservative, is one of the Republicans vying to unseat Democratic Rep. Chris Pappas in New Hampshire\u2019s 1st District. Pappas, first elected in 2018 at the age of 38, held his seat with 51.3% of the vote in 2020. Leavitt \u2013 who will also turn 25 ahead of the midterms \u2013 says she\u2019s running for the House, in part, to bring young voters into the Republican Party. \u201cWe have people in Washington, DC, that have been clinging to power twice as long as I have been alive,\u201d she said. \u201cMy youth is a strength and that is showing on the campaign trail already.\u201d Leavitt grew up scooping ice cream at her family\u2019s local New Hampshire shop. She told CNN that in addition to a desire to inspire young Republicans, she\u2019s also running to protect small businesses, limit government regulation, lower taxes and \u201ccut red tape.\u201d Leavitt, who identifies as a staunch supporter of the Second Amendment, \u201claw and order\u201d and \u201cstrong borders,\u201d said she was first introduced to politics as a student at Saint Anselm College in New Hampshire. After graduating in 2019, she worked as an assistant press secretary in the Trump White House under press secretary Kayleigh McEnany, and following the 2020 election, she served as communications director for GOP Rep. Elise Stefanik of New York, who, when she was elected in 2014 at age 30, was the youngest woman ever elected to Congress. Earlier this year, Stefanik became the No. 3 Republican in the House, ousting Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney as GOP conference chair. Now, Leavitt says, it\u2019s her turn to throw her hat in the ring. \u201cThe Republican Party needs to support, recruit and encourage young candidates because we are losing with young voters,\u201d she said. Both Leavitt and Frost acknowledged that young Americans leaned to the left in the 2020 general election. Though half of young people ages 18-29 voted in 2020 according to research from Center for Information & Research on Civic Learning and Engagement at Tufts (CIRCLE), 60% of that age group cast a ballot for President Joe Biden, while only 36% voted for former President Donald Trump, according to CNN\u2019s 2020 exit polls. Biden carried both of the congressional districts Leavitt and Frost are hoping to represent. Frost said he believes young people voted for Biden \u201cfor specific reasons.\u201d \u201cThey want good infrastructure, good union jobs, and they understand that the climate crisis is happening now,\u201d he said. \u201cYoung folks want to progress, they don\u2019t want to regress.\u201d For her part, Leavitt believes her campaign has the potential to persuade young voters. \u201cOur campaign has the ability to change minds of younger voters,\u201d she added. \u201cWe need to start that work now. We cannot wait another cycle or we will continue to lose as Republicans.\u201d Leavitt plans to host in-person town halls on college campuses, she said, with a goal of engaging in open dialogue with young voters. \u201cI believe if we can have that in-person dialogue, our conservative policies and view point will win and we have the power and ability to change their minds,\u201d she said, citing \u201cindividual liberty,\u201d lessening government spending, and \u201cending the cycle of career politicians that are completely out of touch with future generations of Americans\u201d as conservative issues young voters can get behind.",

            "article_content": "The Texas House approved a raft of new voting restrictions Friday, as majority Republicans seeking to hold on to power in a rapidly changing state finally overcame months of delays by Democrats who said the measure will raise new barriers to the ballot box for marginalized voters. The House voted 80-41 to approve Senate Bill 1. It now moves back to the state Senate to iron out minor differences with the House\u2019s version of the bill before heading to the desk of Republican Gov. Greg Abbott, whose strong-arm tactics \u2013 including calling lawmakers into two special sessions this summer with instructions to approve \u201celection integrity\u201d measures after the Democratic boycott had stymied earlier versions \u2013 paved the way for the bill\u2019s passage. Opponents warned that the bill would make voting harder for people of color, who often back Democrats, as well as people with disabilities \u2013 in part by outlawing the all-night and drive-thru voting that Houston conducted during the 2020 election. \u201cMake no mistake: This is your bill. Your idea. And you would be responsible for the consequences,\u201d Democratic state Rep. Senfronia Thompson, who recalled having to pay a poll tax to vote in Texas prior to 1966, said to her Republican colleagues. \u201cIf you think that you\u2019re winning today by the things that you are putting in this bill, let me give you a prophetic statement: You will reap what you sow. And you know what? It won\u2019t be years or decades from now. It\u2019ll be sooner than you think.\u201d Friday\u2019s vote caps off this summer\u2019s showdown over voting rights, with Republicans in legislatures across the nation seeking to implement new restrictions in the wake of former President Donald Trump\u2019s lies about widespread fraud in the 2020 election. Eighteen states have enacted new laws that make it harder to vote Texas Democrats are now in the same position as the party\u2019s lawmakers in Georgia, Florida and other states that have similarly approved restrictive voting laws this year: dependent on the party\u2019s national leaders to find a way past a Senate filibuster and enact nationwide voter protections. Texas House Democrats had tried for months to halt the GOP\u2019s bill. In the waning hours of Texas\u2019 legislative session in May, House Democrats bolted from the Capitol in Austin to block the chamber from having the quorum necessary to do business \u2013 effectively running out the clock and blocking the bill\u2019s passage. Then, when Abbott called a 30-day special session to try again, those House Democrats fled to Washington, DC \u2013 outside the reach of Republican Speaker Dade Phelan\u2019s order to have them arrested and compelled back into the House chamber to vote. The Democrats spent weeks in Washington organizing a pressure campaign to convince members of Congress to pass federal voting rights protections, which remain stalled on Capitol Hill. The six-week exodus ended after Abbott called a second special session and some Democrats broke ranks and returned to Austin, clearing the path for Republicans to move the measure in the House. Much of SB 1 targets the efforts of Harris County, the home of Houston, to make voting more accessible during the pandemic last year. The county opened drive-thru voting centers and allowed 24-hour early voting \u2013 both of which the bill would prohibit, because it creates a window of 6 a.m. to 10 p.m. in which counties are allowed to conduct early voting. It prohibits local elections officials from sending unsolicited applications to vote by mail, including to voters over the age of 65 who are automatically eligible to cast mail-in ballots. It also places new rules around mail-in voting, increases protections for partisan poll watchers and sets new limits on those who help voters, including those with disabilities, to cast their ballots. The Republican bill authors have repeatedly said the legislation is designed to make it \u201ceasier to vote, harder to cheat.\u201d There is no evidence of widespread voting fraud in Texas. \u201cWe want Texans to be confident in the system,\u201d said Republican Rep. Andrew Murr, the bill\u2019s House sponsor. Opponents, including advocates for voting rights and for people with disabilities told a House committee this month that the bill would disproportionately place new burdens on marginalized groups \u2013 and that the options the measure limits or prohibits were popular with Black and brown voters, including shift workers who cast votes after hours, last year. Democrats could not stop the bill in the Senate earlier this month, though state Sen. Carol Alvarado of Houston filibustered for 15 hours, without being able to take bathroom breaks or drink water. \u201cDo we want access to our electoral process to be more difficult for people with disabilities, or do we want to remove barriers for them?\u201d Alvarado said on the Senate floor. \u201cFor communities of color, do we want to defend the tremendous progress that we\u2019ve made in civil rights and equality or chip away at their voting rights one Senate bill at a time?\u201d In the House on Thursday, as lawmakers began 12 hours of debate on amendments, Phelan, the speaker, began the day by saying he \u201cwould appreciate members not using the term \u2018racism\u2019 this afternoon.\u201d That admonishment incensed some Democrats, who have argued that a measure that disproportionately affects people of color is inherently racist. \u201cIntentional discrimination against people of a certain race \u2013 is that racism?\u201d said Democratic state Rep. Gina Hinojosa. Republicans voted down dozens of Democratic amendments in the House throughout Thursday night, including proposals to allow same-day and automatic voter registration, allow students to use their college IDs to vote, create special voting conditions for people with Covid-19 and require racial impact studies on the changes to voting laws. The January 6 insurrection, in which Trump supporters stormed the US Capitol in an effort to overturn the 2020 election results, also came up during the Texas House\u2019s debate Thursday night. Democratic Rep. Erin Zwiener proposed an amendment that would have added to poll watchers\u2019 oath a pledge that they \u201chave never participated in or encouraged an act of insurrection against this state or the federal government.\u201d Republican Rep. Kyle Biedermann, who was pictured in Washington on that day, accused Zwiener of overstating what had happened on January 6. \u201cYou were not there. You don\u2019t know what happened. All you do is listen to the liberal media,\u201d Biedermann said. Zwiener asked whether Biedermann believed what had happened on January 6 was an insurrection. \u201cOf course not,\u201d he said.",

            "article_content": "Seven US Capitol Police officers are suing former President Donald Trump, Stop the Steal rally organizers and members of far-right extremist groups, accusing them of spreading lies, using White supremacist sentiments to attempt to overthrow the 2020 election, and ultimately bearing responsibility for the riot that injured more than 140 officers on January 6. \u201cPlaintiffs and their fellow law enforcement officers risked their lives to defend the Capitol from a violent, mass attack \u2014 an attack provoked, aided, and joined by Defendants in an unlawful effort to use force, intimidation, and threats to prevent Congress from certifying the results of the 2020 Presidential election,\u201d says the lawsuit, which was filed Thursday in US District Court for the District of Columbia. \u201cBecause of Defendants\u2019 unlawful actions, Plaintiffs were violently assaulted, spat on, tear-gassed, bear-sprayed, subjected to racial slurs and epithets, and put in fear for their lives,\u201d the lawsuit says. \u201cPlaintiffs\u2019 injuries, which Defendants caused, persist to this day.\u201d The new lawsuit is the latest in a string of legal actions against the former President designed to hold him liable for the deadly US Capitol insurrection. CNN has reached out to a Trump spokesperson for comment. Trump has previously denied any responsibility for the  attack at the US Capitol. The 71-page lawsuit also alleges the defendants spread false claims of election fraud and \u201cincited violence against members of Congress and the law enforcement officers whose job it was to protect them.\u201d Among the defendants are alleged members of the far-right extremist groups Proud Boys and Oath Keepers, who are now facing criminal charges for their alleged roles in the riot. Trump makes executive privilege threat as House committee seeks documents from agencies on January 6 attack Last month, police officers who defended the Capitol on January 6 testified during a hearing before the House select committee investigating the events of that day. Their accounts made clear that they are still dealing with physical and mental trauma from the attack. Earlier this year, two US Capitol Police officers sued Trump for inciting the crowd and said they suffered physical and emotional damages because he allegedly \u201cinflamed, encouraged, incited (and) directed\u201d the mob that stormed the Capitol. Democratic lawmakers, including former House impeachment manager Rep. Eric Swalwell of California, have also sued Trump and his associates over the attack. Thursday\u2019s lawsuit comes a few days after the US Capitol Police\u2019s Office of Professional Responsibility determined the USCP officer who shot and killed pro-Trump rioter Ashli Babbitt on January 6 will not face any disciplinary action.

Democrats named the legislation the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancements Act after the civil rights icon and longtime Georgia congressman who died last year. \u201cJohn knew that the fight for justice never truly ends,\u201d tweeted Democratic Rep. Terri Sewell of Alabama. \u201cEach generation must fight & fight again to preserve the progress of the past and advance it. Now it\u2019s our turn.\u201d The bill would restore an aspect of the 1965 Voting Rights Act that allowed the Justice Department to block certain jurisdictions with a history of voter discrimination from changing their voting rules, after conservative justices on the Supreme Court ruled in 2013\u2019s Shelby County v. Holder that the formula used was outdated. Attorney General Merrick Garland recently wrote in The Washington Post that the Voting Rights Act\u2019s \u201cpreclearance\u201d provision was \u201cenormously effective\u201d and led to \u201cthousands of discriminatory voting changes that would have curtailed the voting rights of millions of citizens in jurisdictions large and small.\u201d The bill also responds to the Supreme Court\u2019s 6-3 decision this year in Brnovich v. Democratic National Committee, which limited the ability of minorities to challenge state laws that they say are discriminatory under a different section of the Voting Rights Act. The bill faces a steep climb in the Senate, where the vast majority of Republicans oppose it, calling the legislation a massive federal overreach into the states\u2019 role in elections. At this point, Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski is the only Senate Republican expected to support the bill. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said in June that the bill is \u201cunnecessary\u201d since \u201cit\u2019s against the law to discriminate in voting on the basis of race already,\u201d although the legislation would allow the Justice Department to block a law before it comes into effect.

            "article_content": "Political and population trends are colliding as the steadily escalating tension between red states and their blue cities across the Sun Belt is reaching a breaking point over the volatile issue of school masking. For more than a decade, GOP governors and Republican-controlled legislatures in states from Florida and Georgia to Texas and Arizona, reflecting the priorities and preferences of their primarily White and non-urban coalition, have moved with increasing boldness to override decisions made by Democratic-controlled city and county governments in their states\u2019 racially diverse largest population centers on issues from environmental standards to workplace protections and even police funding. These tensions are reaching a crisis stage in the Sun Belt because they pit the claims of the nation\u2019s core metropolitan economic engines against a GOP management based in the rural-small-town hinterland that still controls the redistricting process and is pulling out all the stops in limiting the urban vote. Mark Muro, policy director, Brookings Institution's Metropolitan Policy Program This steady procession of preemptions has provoked howls of outrage from local officials. But none of those previous overrides \u2013 not even the actions last year by state Republican leaders in those four states to overturn local limits on business hours or capacity during the first months of the pandemic \u2013 has inspired anything like the explicit defiance from local leaders in Florida, Arizona and especially Texas of GOP-crafted state statutes and executive orders that bar public schools from requiring masks for all students and staff. The effort by statewide GOP leaders in multiple states to strip local Democratic officials of their authority over masking \u201cis very consistent with what we\u2019ve been seeing\u201d for years, says David Damore, a University of Nevada at Las Vegas political scientist and co-author of the recent book \u201cBlue Metros, Red States.\u201d \u201cBut now you have a public health issue, so it\u2019s upped the ante compared to a fight over, say, who should regulate Uber. Here it is something that is affecting every community in the country.\u201d The struggle over school masking rules, which is barreling toward decisive rulings in state courts in Florida, Arizona and Texas possibly within days, is crystallizing the conflict between a Democratic coalition that is improving its position throughout the Sun Belt\u2019s largest metropolitan areas and a Republican coalition that still controls statewide power in these states because of its dominance in less densely populated areas. The new Census Bureau figures released last week help explain the intensity of this struggle. Those new data, according to several previously unpublished analyses shared with me, show that in the fastest-growing Sun Belt states, the large metropolitan areas facing the most persistent conflicts with state Republican leaders dominated population growth over the past decade. Sun Belt metro areas like those centered on Atlanta, Dallas, Houston and Phoenix, in fact, are generally among the most dynamic areas anywhere in the nation, soaring not only in population but also in jobs and economic output, and pulling further away from the non-metropolitan areas of their states. \u201cThe reality is that over a decade, there\u2019s been considerably more metropolitan and urban growth in increasingly professional, technologically oriented, fast-growing hubs of states while the non-urban heartland loses people and is losing its economic base,\u201d in industries such as manufacturing and energy production, says Mark Muro, policy director at the Brookings Institution\u2019s Metropolitan Policy Program. \u201cSo in that sense the disjunction has become much wider.\u201d Against the backdrop of these population and job gains, the core underlying question raised by the GOP efforts to preempt local mask requirements is: How long can these metro areas be denied political influence commensurate with their economic clout? \u201cThese tensions,\u201d Muro says, \u201care reaching a crisis stage in the Sun Belt because they pit the claims of the nation\u2019s core metropolitan economic engines against a GOP management based in the rural-small-town hinterland that still controls the redistricting process and is pulling out all the stops in limiting the urban vote.\u201d From any angle, the metro dominance of growth across the Sun Belt leaps from the new census numbers. Jed Kolko, the chief economist for Indeed, the job search site, compared growth in the key Sun Belt states between the very largest metropolitan areas \u2013 those with populations of 1 million or more \u2013 and all other places: He found that the largest metros over the past decade had added population at least three times faster than everywhere else in Arizona, Georgia, Texas and North Carolina, and slightly faster in Florida. \u201cThe fastest-growing places in the country have been the suburbs of big Sun Belt metros, the outlying portions of [places like] Austin or Phoenix,\u201d Kolko says. Muro\u2019s team at Brookings took a broader look, comparing the population growth of all the metropolitan areas in the key Sun Belt states with the remainder living in smaller places. In Texas, Florida and Georgia, the analysis found, the metropolitan areas accounted for about 99% of the states\u2019 increased populations since 2010; in North Carolina, South Carolina and Arizona, the metropolitan areas accounted for more than 100% of the states\u2019 growth, meaning that the smaller non-metropolitan places actually lost population over the past decade. Texas perhaps best crystallizes how much large metros are now driving growth in the Sun Belt. Just the Houston, Dallas-Fort Worth, Austin and San Antonio metropolitan areas \u2013 all jurisdictions where officials are defying Republican Gov. Greg Abbott\u2019s ban on mask mandates \u2013 accounted for fully 87% of the new residents the state added since 2010, according to calculations by Steven Pedigo, director of the Urban Lab at the University of Texas at Austin\u2019s Lyndon B. Johnson School of Public Affairs. Meanwhile, the non-metropolitan areas that favor Republicans remained stagnant, with virtually no population increase over the past decade, he says. The big four metro areas alone now account for 68% of the state\u2019s population, up from 64% in 2010. What\u2019s going on with voting rights is clearly linked to all this as well. If you make it more difficult for your opposition to participate in the election, that\u2019s going to help you in the short run as well. David Damore, political scientist, University of Nevada at Las Vegas \u201cThat\u2019s a pretty significant jump in becoming much more urban,\u201d says Pedigo. \u201cThe Austin metro area in 2010 was 1.7 million; now it\u2019s about 2.3 million. It added about 570,000 people, which is about the size of the District of Columbia.\u201d Meanwhile, he adds, \u201crural Texas is declining: It has 3 million residents, but there is no economic basis there.\u201d These population shifts come as Democrats have improved their standing across these growing metro areas. In 2020, Joe Biden won all of the largest Sun Belt metropolitan areas \u2013 a list that ranges from Charlotte and Raleigh in the East to Phoenix, Denver and Las Vegas in the West \u2013 except for three in Florida (Jacksonville, Tampa and Miami), according to calculations by Damore and the late Robert Lang in a Brookings paper. Biden was the first Democratic presidential nominee to carry all four of the largest Texas metro areas since native son Lyndon Johnson in 1964; he was the first Democrat to win Maricopa County, the core of the Phoenix metro area, since Harry Truman in 1948. If Democrats can sustain those gains, this tilt in the balance of population toward the largest metropolitan centers \u2013 and the concurrent shift toward more racial diversity that the census also documented \u2013 constitutes a fundamental long threat to the GOP dominance in many of the big Sun Belt states, a dynamic already underscored by the breakthroughs from Biden and Democratic Senate candidates in Arizona and Georgia. Still, the population changes alone don\u2019t guarantee that these states will follow the Sun Belt battlegrounds of Colorado and Virginia in moving from solidly Republican in the 1990s to closely contested after 2000 to strongly Democratic-leaning today. Democratic gains are coming more slowly in Texas and North Carolina (another state defined by the split between red rural communities and blue-trending metropolitan ones) and the Republican position in Florida is actually improving, amid a steady inward flow of conservative White retirees and GOP gains among voters with Central and South American roots. And Democrats\u2019 failure last year to win as many US House or especially state legislative seats in Sun Belt suburbs where Biden performed well show that many traditionally Republican-leaning voters in those places haven\u2019t entirely severed their roots. \u201cRemember the urban areas are not monolithic\u201d in moving toward the Democrats, says Bill Miller, a longtime Texas lobbyist and political consultant who has worked for both parties. \u201cIt\u2019s a fractured picture, not a unified picture.\u201d Yet the GOP\u2019s anxieties about the long-term implications of these population shifts are evident in the ferocity of its drive to pass new laws in these states making it more difficult to vote \u2013 and its plans, wherever it has the authority to control legislative and congressional map drawing, for aggressive gerrymanders to dilute the political power of urban areas. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on with voting rights is clearly linked to all this as well,\u201d says Damore. \u201cIf you make it more difficult for your opposition to participate in the election, that\u2019s going to help you in the short run as well.\u201d Amid these conflicting forces \u2013 more urbanization and diversity, consolidating GOP dominance in rural areas and the new wave of voter suppression bills and gerrymanders expected for 2022 \u2013 it\u2019s an open question how long it will take for Democrats to consistently win governorships or state legislative majorities in fast-growing Sun Belt states such as North Carolina, Florida, Georgia, Texas and Arizona \u2013 or whether the party can do it at all. But as the struggle over school masking dramatically illustrates, these states already face an endemic internal struggle. On one side are the rapidly growing major metropolitan areas generally electing Democrats pursuing progressive policy priorities; on the other are rural-based GOP state legislatures and governors that have lost almost any inhibition about overriding those decisions. As Richard Briffault, a Columbia University law professor who studies state preemption, recently told me, \u201cWhat you don\u2019t see is any sense of constraint. What\u2019s so striking now is as soon as an issue gets hot it gets translated into this debate.\u201d The battle between liberal local and conservative state governments across the Sun Belt has covered almost every conceivable issue. Lina Hidalgo, the young Democratic county judge (in effect county executive) in Harris County, Texas \u2013 which includes Houston and is the state\u2019s largest \u2013 spoke for many of her counterparts in large communities when she told me earlier this year that it felt as if GOP state legislators \u201ckeep a to-do list of what counties and cities are doing so they can cancel it out at the next session.\u201d In the modern wave of conflict that traces back roughly to the big GOP statewide gains in the 2010 tea party-fueled election, no issue has been too small for intervention. Over the years, state governments in Texas, Florida and Arizona have blocked cities from banning single-use plastic bags in grocery stores on environmental grounds. North Carolina Republicans, back when they controlled the legislature and the governorship, passed perhaps the most famous of the preemption bills in 2016 when they overturned a city of Charlotte ordinance allowing transgender people to use the bathrooms of the genders they identify with. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis this year signed a law blocking local governments from assessing \u201cimpact fees\u201d on developers for the cost of public infrastructure required by their projects; Texas in 2019 capped local governments\u2019 ability to raise property taxes, at a level too low \u201cto maintain existing programs,\u201d as Austin\u2019s Democratic Mayor Steve Adler says. Georgia has blocked local governments concerned about climate change from limiting new natural gas hook-ups. In the aftermath of the George Floyd racial justice protests, Texas, Florida and Georgia all passed laws making it much more difficult for local governments to cut their police budgets. The Texas state Senate this spring passed legislation (called SB 14) that would eviscerate the authority of local governments to regulate almost any kinds of conditions for workers; among the local statutes that law would overturn are paid leave ordinances in Dallas, Austin and San Antonio (which have already been blocked by state courts) and requirements in Dallas and Austin that construction workers, in a state facing more severe summer heat amid climate change, be given a water break at least every four hours. \u201cIf SB 14 becomes law, then any local ordinance that would deal with employee protections would be a nonstarter,\u201d says Sean Goldhammer, director of employment and legal services for the Workers Defense Action Fund, in Texas. This instinct of Republican statewide officials to preempt Democratic local officials reached a new peak during the initial stages of the coronavirus outbreak last year. Under pressure from then-President Donald Trump, Republican governors such as Doug Ducey in Arizona, Brian Kemp in Georgia, Abbott and DeSantis all repeatedly blocked efforts from Democratic mayors and county officials in their largest metropolitan areas to extend stay-at-home orders, limit business hours of operation or require masks in various settings as the virus raged; Kemp at one point even sued Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms over a mask mandate that she had ordered last summer. In Arizona, Ducey infuriated local officials like Phoenix Mayor Kate Gallego by insisting that golf courses and beauty salons be allowed to stay open even during the worst days of the outbreak.   Yet even those interventions last year didn\u2019t spark anything like the open defiance that has greeted the executive orders in Florida and Texas and the legislation in Arizona barring local governments, including school districts, from requiring masks. (In Georgia, Kemp has avoided full-scale confrontation: He\u2019s rejected calls for statewide mask mandates but also rebuffed demands from conservatives to call a special legislative session to bar any local mask requirements.) Christian Menefee, the attorney for Texas\u2019 Harris County, says that last year \u201cThere wasn\u2019t much of an appetite to go out and file lawsuits\u201d against Abbott\u2019s preemption of local public health rules. But, he says, the heightened level of risk associated with the Delta variant of the coronavirus, which has flooded Texas hospitals with victims, combined with the increased threat it presents to children tipped the balance for many local officials. Once one jurisdiction resisted, he says, others quickly followed: \u201cOne domino fell and then everybody just decided school is about to come in session, the Delta variant is spreading like wildfire, hospitalizations are up, ICU capacity is down \u2026 it\u2019s time for the courts to weigh in on this issue,\u201d Menefee told me. Adds Goldhammer: After years of preemption from state-level Republicans, \u201cwhat\u2019s happening now is kind of like a breaking point.\u201d Briffault says the uprisings against the mask-requirement bans by school and local officials in Florida, Texas and other states remind him of the revolt by national security professionals against Trump\u2019s efforts to strong-arm the Ukrainian government into manufacturing dirt on Biden. \u201cAs professionals, they were appalled by the violation of professional norms and the perverting of national security for ideology, and I think that\u2019s what we are seeing here, especially with the local school boards,\u201d he wrote me in an email. \u201cThese are professional educators, and/or locally-elected officials, deeply concerned about the welfare of their kids and their ability to run their schools safely and effectively. I think this really [is] about the revolt of the professionals against the ideologues.\u201d As both Menefee and Goldhammer acknowledge, the local jurisdictions face long odds of success in the Texas Supreme Court, an elected body composed entirely of Republicans who have steadfastly supported the party\u2019s priorities in the past; indeed, this weekend, the court overturned lower court decisions to issue a temporary injunction against mask requirements in San Antonio and Dallas. The courtroom odds may not be much better for the resisting school districts in Arizona and Florida: Every state Supreme Court justice in both of those states was appointed by Republican governors as well. Given those partisan realities, most expect the GOP governors to ultimately succeed in reversing most of the mask mandates from local Democrats. And at the moment, Republican strategists generally remain confident that they retain the electoral advantage in these states, especially Texas and Florida, where Abbott and DeSantis face reelection next year. One reason is that however the Covid outbreak plays out, next year could be tough for Democrats since the president\u2019s party almost always suffers losses in his first midterm election. Another is that if congressional Democrats don\u2019t pass federal legislation establishing a nationwide floor of voting rights, Republicans could benefit from the restrictive voting laws that Florida, Georgia and Arizona have passed and Texas is attempting to. But if Covid caseloads spike further in these states, particularly among school-age children, success in erasing local mask mandates could prove a Pyrrhic victory, both in political and public health terms, for DeSantis, Abbott and other GOP governors. The price could be especially high if these uncompromising stands alienate suburban voters. With the Republican rural redoubts across the Sun Belt generally losing population and the metropolitan areas burgeoning, experts agree the GOP\u2019s long-term ability to retain power will depend on it holding the line against further Democratic advances in the diversifying and generally well-educated inner suburbs of the big Sun Belt metros, the places Kolko identified as the nation\u2019s fastest growing communities overall. Those suburbs, as Damore puts it, are \u201cthe fault line\u201d in states that are growing more precariously balanced between Democrats dominating center cities and Republicans romping in rural areas. \u201cOnce you start losing the suburbs,\u201d he adds, \u201ceventually there is not enough [other people] left in the state to win.\u201d By aligning so unreservedly with the anti-mask preferences of their conservative and rural base, GOP officials in the burgeoning Sun Belt states may be testing how far they can push even traditionally Republican-leaning suburban voters before too many of them rebel.

            "article_content": "Boyd Camper was set to join the ranks of those pleading guilty in the January 6 insurrection when the federal judge overseeing the case abruptly postponed the plea hearing over questions about whether Camper really believed he did anything wrong. \u201cThen this plea doesn\u2019t go forward,\u201d Judge Colleen Kollar-Kotelly told Camper\u2019s lawyer, who objected to a line in the plea deal that said Camper \u201cunlawfully\u201d entered the US Capitol. \u201cIf he\u2019s in there and doesn\u2019t think he did anything wrong, then there is no plea.\u201d It\u2019s one example of the spectrum of contrition from the Capitol rioters. Some have offered emotional apologies and renounced the \u201cbig lie\u201d about the 2020 election. Others remain defiant and see themselves as \u201cpolitical prisoners.\u201d Some rioters, even while pleading guilty, pushed back when pressed by judges to take responsibility, leading to hiccups and delays at several recent hearings. US Capitol riot judges step up as the conscience of democracy while lawmakers squabble The pushback from rioters comes at a key moment in the national reckoning over January 6 as Congress ramps up its inquiries and as former President Donald Trump and his allies continue to whitewash the deadly attack, often promoting the same self-serving narratives as the rioters. RELATED: US Capitol riot judges step up as the conscience of democracy A lack of remorse could also have legal consequences. Defendants who plead guilty aren\u2019t required to apologize, though it can persuade a judge to show leniency at sentencing. Federal prosecutors have said they\u2019re looking for contrition from the insurrectionists, and they\u2019ve already cited defiant comments from some rioters to argue in court that they deserve time behind bars. Camper, a 54-year-old real estate investor from Montana, came to Washington, DC, to hear Trump speak at the now-infamous rally on January 6. He heeded Trump\u2019s words and marched to the Capitol. Like hundreds of others, he breached the building and got into the Rotunda. He was arrested in March and charged with four misdemeanors. Federal prosecutors offered him the typical deal for nonviolent rioters, and a plea hearing was scheduled for late July. As part of the agreement, Camper was required to admit to key elements of the specific crime he was charged with: Illegally parading, demonstrating, or picketing inside the Capitol building. At a rescheduled plea hearing earlier this month, Camper acknowledged under oath that he entered a \u201crestricted area\u201d and \u201cmade a bad choice.\u201d But when asked if he knew he wasn\u2019t allowed in the Capitol itself, he tried to make the case that police officers \u201cweren\u2019t even trying to stop us\u201d from entering the Capitol. \u201cThe door was literally held up by someone who appeared to be a person of authority,\u201d he said. Nonetheless, the judge accepted his guilty plea, and his sentencing is set for November. Camper\u2019s attorney declined to comment when asked by CNN for evidence backing up his claims about the police. Another pro-Trump rioter, John Lolos, nearly derailed his August 4 plea hearing when he made a similar comment about police supposedly waiving him into the crypt in the Capitol basement. \u201cI just wanted to get that off my chest (and) on the record,\u201d Lolos told the judge. Prosecutors asked if he was trying to renege on the plea agreement. His lawyer said he wanted to move forward with the deal, as written, and might raise the issue at sentencing. Lolos faces a maximum of six months in jail. Still, it might be risky to shift some blame onto the police. Before sentencing, judges closely review recommendations from the prosecutors and the defense. And the Justice Department has said \u201cevidence of remorse or contrition\u201d is one key to getting a favorable recommendation. Calls for violence online similar to before January 6 Capitol attack, DHS Intel chief says \u201cIt boils down to defendants saying that they learned a lesson from all this,\u201d said Michael Zeldin, a former federal prosecutor and criminal defense attorney in Washington, DC. \u201cIf I were still a defense lawyer, I\u2019d have my clients affirmatively doing things to demonstrate that these aren\u2019t just words \u2026 to show they\u2019re sincere in these new beliefs and they\u2019re already acting on them.\u201d That\u2019s exactly what Indiana grandmother Anna Morgan-Lloyd tried to do. She told Judge Thomas Hogan she went through a political transformation after watching movies and reading books about racial inequality. She apologized for her \u201cshameful\u201d participation in a \u201csavage display of violence.\u201d The judge gave her probation. But one day after sentencing, she went on Fox News and offered a very different perspective: She said she only entered the Capitol to protect an elderly woman, called the rioters \u201cvery polite,\u201d and said police were \u201crelaxed\u201d and \u201cdidn\u2019t tell anybody to leave.\u201d The about-face caught the eye of federal Judge Thomas Hogan, who cited Morgan-Lloyd while recently presiding over the plea hearing for a married couple that stormed the Capitol. Hogan said he was \u201cconcerned whether (we\u2019re) getting true acceptance of responsibility\u201d from rioters. Some Republicans have downplayed the attack by comparing it to a tourist visit, falsely claiming that jailed defendants are \u201cpolitical prisoners,\u201d and lionizing the rioter who was killed by police. And the \u201cpolice-let-us-in\u201d theory has popped up in many Capitol riot cases \u2013 and simultaneously emerged as a GOP talking point in Trump\u2019s recent interviews and in congressional hearings. Capitol rioter downplays attack after apologizing for her crimes in court \u201cIn all fairness, the Capitol Police were ushering people in,\u201d Trump told two Washington Post reporters who published a bombshell book about his tumultuous final year in the White House. He repeated this claim in a lie-filled Fox News interview where he said there was a \u201clovefest\u201d between police and rioters, and \u201cthey ought to release the tape to see what really happened.\u201d At an oversight hearing in June, Rep. Glenn Grothman, a Wisconsin Republican, said some of the rioters \u201cappeared to almost be escorted in by the Capitol Police.\u201d He also claimed many of the pro-Trump rioters \u201cwould have had no idea (or) way of knowing they\u2019re breaking the law.\u201d Prosecutors have rebutted these theories in court, and judges have opined that the illegality of the breach should\u2019ve been obvious, because of the alarms, tear gas, and battles with police. \u201cWhen you were standing on the steps with a mob, you thought that was okay?\u201d Chief Judge Beryl Howell of the DC District Court asked Glenn Croy at his plea hearing. \u201c\u2026 What you\u2019re saying here today, under oath, is that you did not know that you weren\u2019t supposed to be there?\u201d Croy responded by saying he \u201cdid not see any barriers\u201d on his walk from the Trump rally to the Capitol, and that he \u201cdidn\u2019t realize at the time\u201d that he wasn\u2019t allowed onto the Capitol steps. \u201cI knew (the police) were trying to get people off those steps, but I had no idea,\u201d Croy said. \u201c\u2026 I didn\u2019t know it was an unlawful assembly until later\u2026 even with the smoke grenades and stuff.\u201d The judge accepted his guilty plea and he will be sentenced in October. Prosecutors recently squared off with another rioter, Robert Reeder, who pleaded guilty but argued that he should receive probation because he only went inside the Capitol to find water after getting pepper sprayed. He also faulted police for ineffectively guarding the building. \u201cThe officers were standing near the walls and neither verbally nor otherwise attempted to keep Mr. Reeder from walking into the building,\u201d his lawyer wrote. Explaining why Reeder stayed inside the building, his lawyer continued, \u201cMr. Reeder, who had never been in the Capitol before, was struck by the awe and the beauty of the Rotunda and began taking pictures and videos.\u201d In response, federal prosecutors wrote that Reeder\u2019s argument \u201cis the equivalent of blaming homeowners for not having a better security system or doing more to stop a mob of burglars.\u201d They also slammed Reeder for claiming in an April FBI interview that the riot was \u201ca plan to allow people in\u201d so the media could \u201cdemonize the Trump people\u201d \u2013 a conspiracy theory that 55% of Republicans believe is true, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll that was conducted in April. Reeder offered \u201ca self-serving rewrite of history that sought to portray himself as a hapless tourist, absolve himself of any wrongdoing (and) place blame on others,\u201d prosecutors wrote, urging the judge to give him two months in jail. His sentencing is scheduled for Wednesday. CNN\u2019s Joe Beare contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "The leader of the Justice Department\u2019s civil rights division told Congress Monday that \u201cvoting rights are under pressure to an extent that has not been seen since the Civil Rights era.\u201d US Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke is testifying in front of a House Judiciary subcommittee hearing about voting rights legislation, as the House prepares to move forward a major element of Democrats\u2019 voting rights push. Her prepared opening statement addressed provisions in the 1965 Voting Rights Act that were gutted by Supreme Court in 2013. House Democrats are preparing to introduce legislation to revive the VRA\u2019s so-called \u201cpreclearance\u201d regime, which, before the 2013 ruling, required localities with a history of racial voting discrimination to get the department\u2019s or a federal court\u2019s approval for election procedure changes. John Roberts and the Supreme Court might block anything Democrats do on voting rights Since that 2013 Supreme Court ruling, Clarke said Monday, according to her written testimony \u201cWe have seen an upsurge in changes to voting laws that make it more difficult for minority citizens to vote and that is even before we confront a round of decennial redistricting where jurisdictions may draw new maps that have the purpose of effect of diluting or retrogressing minority voting strength.\u201d Her testimony called on Congress \u201cto pass appropriate legislation that will restore and improve the Voting Rights Act, enhancing the department\u2019s ability to protect the right to vote in the twenty-first century and beyond.\u201d Legislation to restore the preclearance process \u2013 a bill known as the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act \u2013 has long been in the works. That bill is in addition to the For the People Act, which would establish nationwide ballot access mandates like expanded mail voting and early voting, while requiring that states adopt independent redistricting commissions. The For the People Act passed in the House but it is stalled in the Senate, while the John Lewis bill is expected to be taken up by the House later this month. Pieces of both bills are being considered in Senate negotiations for a voting rights package that would win the support of West Virginia Democrat Sen. Joe Manchin. But even with his support, a filibuster by Senate Republicans will keep the voting rights legislation from reaching President Joe Biden\u2019s desk. Manchin and other Democratic centrists have balked at changing the filibuster rules. Even in the face of the legislative obstacles, the Biden administration has made voting rights a top priority. Clarke, who started her legal practice as a career attorney in the DOJ\u2019s voting section, is one of three attorneys with deep voting rights experience that Biden appointed to top DOJ roles.   Clarke, in her testimony, emphasized the effectiveness of the Voting Rights Act when the preclearance regime was fully functional. Under it, 3,000 voting changes were blocked for their discriminatory intent or effect between 1965 and 2013, according to her written testimony. Still, Clarke said, that was only one percent of all the changes the department considered, and jurisdictions were otherwise able \u201cto institute new voting changes or rules without interference.\u201d She reiterated what Attorney General Merrick Garland alluded to in a recent Washington Post op-ed: that while the Justice Department has the authority to challenge individual laws that threaten voting rights \u2013 the DOJ sued the state of Georgia this summer \u2013 case by case challenges aren\u2019t adequate since litigation is complex, requires vast resources, and is too time intensive to adequately address inequities fast enough. Her testimony also addressed what the absence of a preclearance regime means for the coming redistricting cycle, which will be the first redistricting cycle since the 2013 Supreme Court decision. \u201cWithout preclearance, the department will not have access to maps and other redistricting-related information from many jurisdictions where there is reason for concern,\u201d she said.

            "article_content": "Donald Trump got it. Years before long-awaited 2020 census data published Thursday showed a dramatic picture of a less-White, more diverse, less rural, more metropolitan nation, Trump built a political apparatus on the idea that America\u2019s traditional face was changing. From his racist \u201cbirther\u201d campaign against ex-President Barack Obama to a 2016 campaign launch targeting Mexican immigrants, Trump positioned himself as the spokesman for a racial and social culture he portrayed as under attack. That continued when he became President, with his equivocation over White supremacist marchers in Charlottesville, Virginia (ironically four years to the day before the publication of the census data), to his support for Confederate monuments that lionized the men who fought to preserve slavery. Even now, his political action committee is called Save America, adding to a sense \u2013 fueled by right-wing media titans like Tucker Carlson of Fox News and activists who demagogue teaching about the history of race in schools \u2013 that the country many White culturally conservative citizens always knew is somehow being stolen by outside usurpers and cosmopolitan elites. Trump has always been more of a showman than a political scientist. But his often-dastardly political talents are based on an instinctive reading of the political fault lines of a changing, divided nation. The census data explains many of the trends he set out to exploit with his nativist, populist campaigns, which intuited a demographic tipping point at a dynamic moment of change. But while it adds context to the Trump phenomenon, the census data also suggests that the long-term trends are unfavorable to his strategy of appealing overwhelmingly to a declining base of mostly White, rural Americans. In that sense, this census represents a milestone in one way of looking at events over the last decade-and-a-half of American politics \u2013 as a clash between multiracial, younger Americans represented by Obama\u2019s hope-and-change movement and Trump\u2019s own backlash campaigns with a far older, homogeneous demographic. The new data suggests that ultimately, if politics is dictated by demographics, the future belongs to Obama\u2019s heirs rather than Trump\u2019s, since people of color represented 43% of the US population in 2020, up from 34% in 2010. The non-Hispanic White share of the US population fell to 57% in 2020, down 6 percentage points from the last census in 2010, according to the new findings. The new census also poses questions about how Democrats position their party in the future \u2013 specifically its attitude to a White working-class audience. President Joe Biden\u2019s appeal to these voters was important on the margins in the 2020 election and may have helped to lower Trump\u2019s margins in the ex-President\u2019s best-performing districts in states like Pennsylvania and Wisconsin, both of which Biden won last November. The current President, for instance, won 41% of White voters, according to exit polls, compared with 2016 Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton\u2019s 37%. Much of Biden\u2019s ambitious economic program, including more than $4.5 trillion in proposed infrastructure spending, targets many of these voters in an effort partly designed to puncture the populist appeal of Trump-like candidates. But since the growth of the population is concentrated in more diverse communities, there will be more pressure among Democrats to target the latter group, meaning that Biden\u2019s approach might represent the party\u2019s last dance with a voting bloc that once represented much of its base.   Changing demographics that make the country more diverse do not automatically mean that Democrats always profit and gain more blue states. Trump, for instance, actually improved his standing among Hispanic voters in 2020. Talented campaigners like Obama and Trump create their own coalitions and can change the mathematical laws of politics to win power. But the census data also includes fascinating snapshots that help explain some of the most intriguing political conflicts boiling in a diverse nation. The fastest-growing metro area in the country between 2010 and 2020 was The  Villages, a sprawling retirement community in Florida, which grew from about 93,000 people in 2010 to about 130,000. The area has become a political battleground in recent elections, and its growth should be good news for Republicans, since Sumter County, where it is located, went for Trump over Biden by 62,761 votes to 29,341 in the last election. In real terms, the population increase might seem small. But in 2018, now-Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, who is seeking reelection next year, beat his Democratic rival, Andrew Gillum, by only 32,400 votes statewide, and by 30,000 in Sumter County itself. In another intriguing finding, in the context of the fast growth of many cities, the census helps explain the current forces roiling politics in Texas. It reveals that Houston, San Antonio, Austin and Dallas-Fort Worth are all growing while the populations of many rural areas are declining. Many of the political showdowns in the Lone Star State, including over voting rights and masks in schools amid the Covid-19 pandemic, involve duels between the Republican Gov. Greg Abbott and legislature and the Democratic strongholds in the cities. With this in mind, it is not surprising that Republicans in Texas are pushing for the kinds of changes to voting laws that would make it harder to vote in populous cities \u2013 by cutting down early or mail-in voting \u2013 while preserving or even expanding access to the polls in rural areas. The increasing size and power of cities revealed in the census also suggests that the Republican Party \u2013 which in recent times has tended to portray urban areas as seething with crime and corruption \u2013 may need to rethink and produce candidates and policies that appeal to the vast metropolitan areas that seem likely to account for a higher share of the vote in decades to come. The GOP\u2019s problems also extend to suburban areas around major cities where Trump often performed poorly during the 2020 election. This was an emerging reality that was also true in historically red states, and again helps explain the 2018 Senate race in Texas, where Sen. Ted Cruz only narrowly squeezed past his Democratic challenger, former Rep. Beto O\u2019Rourke. Another state where the census sheds light on current political battles \u2013 and the tensions between America\u2019s booming cities, which tend to contain more liberal voters, and sparsely populated rural areas \u2013 is Arizona.   \u201cThe fastest-growing of these large cities was Phoenix, whose population increased by 11.2% this decade,\u201d said Marc Perry, the senior demographer of the Population Division of the Census Bureau. Phoenix is in Maricopa County, the decisive battleground in Arizona where Biden beat Trump by 45,000 votes on the way to capturing the Grand Canyon State\u2019s 11 electoral votes. It is also the venue for a sham recount by Republican state legislators based on Trump\u2019s lies about electoral fraud. If Republicans couldn\u2019t beat Biden by fair means in the county, they are trying to discredit his victory based on false claims. The evolution of Texas and Arizona, and the broader changes nationwide, do not just point to long-term challenges for both parties. They also provide a compelling rationale for the raft of restrictive voting laws being passed in Republican-run states following Trump\u2019s assault on US democracy. If a party that is more and more appealing to its dwindling White base is not prepared to do more to court a wider range of voters, then it is going to have to find more nefarious methods to stay in power. Making it harder for Democrats, city dwellers and minorities to vote is one way to achieve this end. Martin Luther King III \u2013 the eldest son of the revered civil rights campaigner, and chairman of the Drum Major Institute \u2013 vowed to thwart efforts by the GOP to prevent the changing appearance of the nation from diluting their own power. \u201cSome elected officials are afraid that if they embrace a more diverse America, they will lose their power,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cThose same people are willing to weaponize the new Census data to gerrymander the vote and rig the system against Black and Brown Americans,\u201d he said. The sense that the GOP is seeking to retain power despite its base becoming closer to a permanent minority in the nation is likely to further calls from liberals in the years to come for the abolishment of the Senate filibuster. The chamber\u2019s rule that effectively requires a 60-vote supermajority to pass major legislation is being used by Republicans to stall voting rights reform written by Democrats to counter state voter repression laws. \u201cIf we don\u2019t eliminate the filibuster to pass federal voting protections, we\u2019re once again allowing White minority rule to govern this nation,\u201d said Stephany Spaulding, spokesperson for Just Democracy, a racial justice coalition. That imposes additional pressure on more moderate Democrats like Biden and Sens. Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, who oppose the abolition of the filibuster. In the short term, the census may contain good news for Republicans, since it will kick off the race for the redistricting of congressional seats. As Democrats have only an eight-seat majority in the House of Representatives, even minute changes on the map could have huge implications. Redistricting could result in the loss of a number of seats from blue states and additions in others where Trump won last year. Even so, there are also signs that the redrawing of the maps \u2013 a fraught process featuring complicated lawsuits \u2013 may not be as bad as some Democrats feared. The decline of rural populations and the growing might of cities could mean that some seats must be sketched to include more Democratic voters in a way that may be an omen for political developments in years to come.",

The legislation, known as the \u201cJohn Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act,\u201d is now a focus of the House and is expected to be part of the voting rights package negotiated in the Senate to win over West Virginia Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin\u2019s support. The bill would restore a provision of the Voting Rights Act meant to address racial discrimination that was gutted by the Supreme Court in 2013. Doing so has long been a goal of lawmakers, and one that seemed only remotely possible after Democrats obtained narrow control of Congress while winning the White House. RELATED: \u2018Democracy will be on the ballot\u2019: Secretary of state races emerge as newest US political flashpoint But Democrats have had to move deliberately in how they\u2019ve advanced that aspect of their voting rights push, in the hopes of protecting it from the kinds of Supreme Court cases that have undermined the Voting Rights Act, most recently this summer. \u201cThe bill has to pass constitutional muster,\u201d a House Democratic staffer involved in the process told CNN.  The legislation seeks to revive the VRA\u2019s so-called preclearance process, under which certain changes to voting rules had to get the approval of either the Justice Department or a federal court. The interest in restoring it has only increased as former President Donald Trump\u2019s lies about mass election fraud have ushered in a new wave of state voter restrictions. Senate Republicans block effort by Democrats to advance voting and election bill Still, legal experts remain skeptical that any amount of procedural legwork by Congress would be enough for the current Supreme Court and its 6-3 conservative-liberal majority.\u201cWhichever way congress would go in trying to amend the Voting Rights Act and reestablish some form of preclearance, it\u2019s going to have a Supreme Court where at least some members are going to be extremely skeptical of congressional power in this area,\u201d said Rick Hasen, law professor at University of California, Irvine. The John Lewis bill, named after the late Black civil rights activist who then served in the House for more than three decades, is aimed at addressing the Supreme Court decision Shelby County vs. Holder, which dismantled a major part of the 1965 Voting Rights Act. That 5-4 decision invalidated the formula used to determine which states needed federal approval for changes to their voting practices, because of their history of racial discrimination at the ballot box. Chief Justice John Roberts\u2019 majority opinion for the 5-4 court said that the data the preclearance formula relied on was outdated. Congress may \u201cdraft another formula based on current conditions,\u201d the court said. So, for their current attempt to fix the VRA, Democrats have collected thousands of pages of testimony and documents \u2013 summed up in a 128-page report released last week by the House Administration Subcommittee on Elections \u2013 that they say shows current racial voting discrimination that justifies the revival of preclearance. \u201cWe\u2019re putting it together in a report so that next time there\u2019s a lawsuit, they can\u2019t throw it out on these grounds that the data are old, that we\u2019re basing it on something that is outdated,\u201d a House Administration Committee staff member told CNN. \u201cBecause we\u2019ve gone out and collected evidence and testimony \u2013 thousands of pages of it.\u201d The report was the culmination of a dozen-plus hearings the subcommittee held starting in 2019, in addition to a handful of hearings that have also been hosted by the House Judiciary Committee. Now that the House Administration\u2019s report has been released, the Judiciary Committee will have jurisdiction of the John Lewis bill as it advances to the House floor. The latest version of the bill hasn\u2019t been introduced yet, but is expected soon. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi announced Tuesday night that when the House returns later this month, it will \u201clikely\u201d be taking up the legislation. RELATED: 56 years after the Voting Rights Act of 1965, lawmakers struggle to find common ground A House Judiciary subcommittee will be holding a hearing Monday with US Assistant Attorney General Kristen Clarke, who leads the Justice Department\u2019s civil rights division. In a speech about voting rights earlier this summer, Attorney General Merrick Garland promised that the department would \u201cwork with Congress to provide all necessary support as it considers federal legislation to protect voting rights.\u201d Congress held several hearings and compiled a voluminous record during its 2006 reauthorization of the VRA. That still wasn\u2019t enough to convince the Supreme Court, in Shelby County, to leave the law undisturbed. However, at the time, and despite the warnings of election law professors, Congress didn\u2019t adjust the preclearance formula itself, which singled out states and jurisdictions based on voter registration data from the 1960s and 1970s, among other factors. RELATED: Seventeen states have enacted 28 new laws making it harder to vote While details of the coming version of the John Lewis bill remain to be seen, an iteration introduced in 2019 showed that the House was tweaking its preclearance approach. Rather than using just geography to determine when election procedures need federal approval, the 2019 bill also adopted a \u201ccovered practices\u201d section. Those provisions would subject certain kinds of rules \u2013 such as ID requirements or reductions in multilingual voting materials \u2013 to preclearance. \u201cThe Supreme Court clearly was looking for a dynamic kind of policy that was responding to what was happening in the world,\u201d said Sean Morales-Doyle, the acting director of the Democracy Program at the liberal-leaning Brennan Center, which is one of the voting rights organizations working with lawmakers on the bill. Whether the carefully crafted rollout will be worth it is another question. First there are the legislative obstacles. Once it passes the Democratic-controlled House, the legislation will go the Senate, where its supporters will either need to win the votes of 10 Republicans or convince Democratic centrists like Manchin to change their mind on the filibuster. Currently, there are negotiations ongoing in the Senate about a compromise package that would combine parts of the John Lewis bill with pieces of the \u201cFor the People Act,\u201d a separate Democratic elections bill that includes several voting rights provisions. RELATED: Young people in West Virginia look to push Manchin in hopes of passing federal voting rights legislation Though he balked at the original version of the For The People Act, Manchin has been supportive of the John Lewis bill. But getting the Senate Democratic caucus unified behind a voting rights package won\u2019t solve the filibuster conundrum the legislation faces. If Democrats achieve the unlikely and put a version of the John Lewis bill on President Joe Biden\u2019s desk, what happens in the court is just as treacherous. There is no doubt that it would face a legal challenge that would likely go to the Supreme Court. In the Shelby County decision, and rulings since then, the conservative justices have shown themselves extremely wary of the need for federal intervention in how states run their elections. Notable signals were the majority opinions that Justice Samuel Alito wrote in a 2018 Texas redistricting case and then in this year\u2019s Brnovich v. Hobbs. Those cases dealt with a VRA provision separate from the preclearance requirement. But the rulings set a high bar for when the federal government can step in to address racial voting discrimination in state election practices. John Roberts takes aim at the Voting Rights Act and political money disclosures, again There are currently discussions around inserting in the John Lewis bill language that would address Brnovich, according to activists involved in Congress\u2019 work on the voting rights legislation. \u201cThere are very few avenues that you can challenge discriminatory practices under the Voting Rights Act now,\u201d said Jesselyn McCurdy, the managing director for government affairs at the Leadership Conference on Civil and Human Rights. As the bill is crafted though, lawmakers will be walking a line between making it effective enough to protect the voters who face discrimination, while still targeted enough to convince a conservative judiciary not to knock it down. \u201cThat political impulse is running against a very conservative court,\u201d said Guy-Uriel E. Charles, an election law professor at Harvard University. CNN\u2019s Lauren Fox contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "The blue-collar barricade looms as the most stubborn obstacle to President Joe Biden enlarging his base of support. As both candidate and president, Biden has devoted enormous effort to regaining ground with working-class voters, particularly the White voters without college degrees who have drifted away from the Democrats since the 1970s. But in the campaign, he improved on Hillary Clinton\u2019s anemic 2016 performance with those voters only modestly. And in office, an array of recent polls show he\u2019s failed to increase his approval rating with those non-college-educated White voters much, if at all, beyond the roughly one-third of them who he attracted last November \u2013 even though he\u2019s aimed much of his rhetoric and presidential travel at them and formulated an agenda that would shower them with new government benefits.   Biden\u2019s small gains with these voters last fall still helped him tip the critical Rust Belt battlegrounds of Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, and many Democrats say that any progress with them will be critical to the party\u2019s electoral fortunes in 2022 and 2024. \u201cThe key is you have a president who is speaking to them and fighting for them, non-college-educated voters of all races,\u201d says John Anzalone, who served as a lead pollster for Biden during the campaign. \u201cI think he has their attention, and that\u2019s what is really important for the future, whether the 2022 election or 2024.\u201d But the continuing resistance confronting even Biden \u2013 a 78-year-old White Catholic who highlights his working-class roots at every turn \u2013 underscores the challenge an increasingly diverse and culturally liberal Democratic Party will face in recovering as much support as it attracted from these voters as recently as in Barack Obama\u2019s two campaigns. It may be too strong to say Biden represents the Democrats\u2019 last chance to restore their competitiveness with working-class White voters. But it seems likely that if he can\u2019t do so, there are few others in the Democrats\u2019 next generation of emerging leaders who have a better chance. \u201cI don\u2019t see people on the horizon\u201d who could do better for Democrats, says David Kochel, a Republican consultant based in Iowa, one of the heartland states where the rightward shift of working-class Whites, especially those in rural and exurban communities, has decisively tipped the partisan balance toward the GOP. Working-class White voters constituted the bedrock of the Democratic coalition from the 1930s to the 1960s but the party has lost ground among them, largely because of issues relating to race and culture, in the half century since. For almost as long, the party has debated how much emphasis to place on recapturing those voters. This long-running argument has functioned as a proxy for the larger question of whether Democrats should tack toward the center or move left, particularly on social issues. Party centrists often cite the need to hold as many blue-collar White voters as possible, particularly across the Rust Belt, to justify a more moderate approach; liberals often complain that an excessive focus on those generally culturally conservative Whites leads the party to downplay causes, like aggressive action on climate and racial equity, that could energize more younger and non-White voters, particularly in emerging Sun Belt battlegrounds such as Georgia, Arizona, North Carolina and eventually Texas. All of the obsessing over a 3% uptick in White non-college polling numbers [for Biden] misses the larger and more important reality: There is a ceiling for Democrats [with them] so long as they are seen as the party affiliated with people of color. Are we really supposed to get excited over 32% support instead of [Hillary] Clinton\u2019s 29%? Isn\u2019t the dominant, and consistent, reality the nonsupport? Steve Phillips, founder, Democracy in Color Each side can point to relevant demographic trends for its case. Whites without college degrees have steadily declined as a share of all voters by about 2 to 3 percentage points over each four-year presidential term for decades, while Whites with college degrees and especially non-White voters have expanded in turn. (Although those non-college Whites remain the biggest bloc in the electorate, they fell below 40% of the national total for the first time last fall, according to Census Bureau figures.) As both their overall numbers and support for Democrats have declined, these non-college Whites have fallen by half, from nearly 60% of self-identified Democrats in 1996 to only 30% now, according to analysis by the Pew Research Center. (They remain about three-fifths of all Republicans, Pew found.) On the other hand, blue-collar Whites remain overrepresented as a share of voters in Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin \u2013 the three Rust Belt states that will remain pivotal to Democrats\u2019 White House hopes until they can more reliably win the Sun Belt battlegrounds. Biden\u2019s presidency stands as a potential hinge in this extended debate: If even he can\u2019t significantly improve the party\u2019s position with these voters, it will likely embolden those who want the party to shift its emphasis from the Rust Belt to the Sun Belt; from recovering working-class Whites to mobilizing its emerging coalition of younger voters of color as well as college-educated Whites. \u201cThe electoral danger\u201d in Biden\u2019s strategy of focusing so heavily on recapturing blue-collar voters, says Steve Phillips, founder of the advocacy group Democracy in Color, is that \u201cDemocrats will be so focused on not alienating Whites that they will mute the policy agenda that could excite the sectors of the electorate which are much more receptive.\u201d And those voting blocs, Phillips adds, \u201cpeople of color and young people, are also the growing parts of the population.\u201d It\u2019s difficult to overstate how much Biden has targeted working-class voters, especially White working-class voters, during his presidency. As a recent CNN analysis found, his presidential travel has focused heavily on blue-collar communities, with Pennsylvania, Michigan and Ohio topping the list of states he has visited. And blue-collar White voters clearly have influenced one of the White House\u2019s defining political strategies: to generally limit Biden\u2019s personal engagement with hot-button cultural issues (from gun control to voting rights) and to overwhelmingly focus his public appearances on kitchen table concerns: shots in the arm, checks in the pocket, shovels in the ground. Biden routinely calls his economic agenda a \u201cblue-collar blueprint to build America\u201d and his proposals would shower working-class voters of all races with a wide array of new government benefits. The $1.9 trillion stimulus plan included direct $1,400 payments and a vastly expanded tax credit for families with children that benefited almost all voters without a college education. The bipartisan infrastructure plan expected to receive Senate approval Tuesday is centered on blue-collar jobs rebuilding roads, bridges and water systems. The follow-on $3.5 trillion human capital budget bill Democrats plan to advance this week offers working-class families increased subsidies for health insurance and child care, guaranteed paid family leave, expanded Medicare benefits and, for their children, access to universal preschool and two years of free community college. Some experts have described the cumulative package as the largest expansion of direct government assistance to working families since Social Security during the New Deal. But so far, Biden has very little to show for it in terms of improved approval among White working-class voters. In the latest Gallup Poll for July, his approval rating among Whites without college degrees stood at 34%; he\u2019s exceeded 38% among them in only one of Gallup\u2019s monthly surveys. Surveys released over the last few weeks by Monmouth and Quinnipiac universities, as well as an NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll, likewise put his approval with those voters at just 32-34%. (Another Marist poll showed him at 37%.) In each case, his approval rating among those non-college-educated White voters was about 20 percentage points less than his standing among White voters with college degrees. As this nation becomes majority people of color you will have to think about the broader coalition of the electorate. Taifa Smith Butler, president, Demos With approval from roughly one-third of working-class Whites, Biden\u2019s support now remains essentially unchanged from his vote among them last November: The major data sources (including the network exit polls conducted by Edison Research, the academic Cooperative Election Study and the Pew Research Center\u2019s validated voters study) all showed him winning almost exactly one-third of them. In each case, that was only slightly better than Clinton\u2019s performance in 2016, when most of the data sources showed her winning just under 3 in 10 of those voters. Biden\u2019s performance also remained well below the roughly 40% of these voters that Democrats won in each presidential race from 1988 to 2008, according to the exit polls. Previously unpublished details on the 2020 results provided to me by each of those sources offer a more nuanced picture of Biden\u2019s performance. Democratic analysts who believe the party must continue emphasizing blue-collar White voters often argue that the Democrats\u2019 weakness with them is exaggerated by the large number of culturally conservative evangelical Christians in their ranks. And indeed, the previously unpublished results provided to me from the exit polls, the Cooperative Election Study and Pew all show that Biden lost non-college-educated White voters who identify as evangelical Christians by an even larger margin than Clinton did: All three of those sources showed Donald Trump winning about 85% or more of those voters, up from around 80% in 2016. Trump\u2019s support among White non-college evangelicals reached about 90% in Southern states such as Georgia, Texas and North Carolina, according to the exit polls. By contrast, each of those three studies showed Biden improving over Clinton among the non-college White voters who are not evangelical Christians. Even so, all three studies still showed him losing those non-evangelical blue-collar Whites to Trump and winning only 42% to 47% of them. Comparing each study with its own 2016 results, only in Pew\u2019s did Biden significantly improve over Clinton\u2019s performance with them. For many liberal analysts, the big takeaway in these results is that Biden has made such marginal gains with blue-collar Whites as a candidate and as President. \u201cAll of the obsessing over a 3% uptick in White non-college polling numbers [for Biden] misses the larger and more important reality: There is a ceiling for Democrats [with them] so long as they are seen as the party affiliated with people of color. Are we really supposed to get excited over 32% support instead of Clinton\u2019s 29%?\u201d says Phillips, author of the upcoming book \u201cHow We Win the Civil War.\u201d \u201cIsn\u2019t the dominant, and consistent, reality the nonsupport?\u201d While Biden has framed his public identity around courting blue-collar Whites, Phillips says, the party would be better served by investing more \u201cin efforts to increase turnout of people of color\u201d especially across the Sun Belt; focusing more on causes that energize young people (including racial justice and climate change); and redirecting \u201csome of the millions of dollars spent on research and data analysis on trying to better understand how to increase White support for racial justice instead of the current practice of seeking magic words for Democratic candidates by downplaying any connection to people of color.\u201d Similarly, Taifa Smith Butler, the new president of Demos, a liberal think tank focused on racial equity, told me, \u201cAs this nation becomes majority people of color you will have to think about the broader coalition of the electorate.\u201d Democrats, she said, \u201ccannot kowtow\u201d to an older White electorate at the price of sublimating the priorities of \u201cmarginalized communities \u2026 that we could be lifting up and elevating\u201d rather than \u201ccontinuing to try to appease White moderates.\u201d The counter view in the party is that even the very small gains among working-class voters remain pivotal. Exit polls in 2020 found that among these non-college White voters, Biden did improve slightly over Clinton in Pennsylvania and more substantially in Wisconsin and Michigan. Those gains were modest, notes Sean McElwee, a leading pollster for progressive causes, but they had an outsized impact by helping Biden recapture the three Rust Belt states that keyed Trump\u2019s 2016 victory. Inflation and the overall cost of living is going to bite the non-college working class a heck of a lot more than it is the white-collar upscale college grads. There\u2019s a lot of things working against him that he doesn\u2019t have much control over. David Kochel, Republican consultant \u201cWhen you are dealing with a demographic group as large as non-college Whites, any sort of difference matters,\u201d says McElwee. McElwee says the evidence is that only a very small number of working-class Whites may be open to persuasion from Biden, but \u201cthe problem is that increasingly small groups of people are still determinative in politics.\u201d He adds: \u201cIf you look at how close these margins are in Michigan or in Pennsylvania, we can\u2019t afford to lose 2 to 3 points with non-college Whites because it is such a big demographic. \u201c McElwee is optimistic that Biden\u2019s kitchen table agenda ultimately will propel at least some gains with blue-collar voters: In polling that his company Data for Progress has done for the advocacy group Fighting Chance for Families, for instance, Trump voters who have received the child tax credit express much more positive views about it than those who have not. Anzalone, the Biden pollster, likewise says the picture may look different once families receive more of the tangible benefits Biden is promoting. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of stuff \u2026 people won\u2019t see for a long time,\u201d Anzalone says. \u201cThe bottom line is this is a president who is committed to create opportunities for working families to succeed and be a bigger part of this economy. \u2026 This [political] conversation a year from now may be different. The fact is he\u2019s competing for this demographic, and that\u2019s important.\u201d Republicans, though, generally express confidence that their blue-collar barricade will hold against Biden\u2019s strategy of emphasizing material benefits and downplaying cultural fights. The GOP approach has been less to directly attack Biden\u2019s kitchen table agenda than to shift the subject toward hot-button, racially tinged issues that trigger the cultural conservatism of most White non-college voters, a list that includes crime, \u201ccritical race theory\u201d and above all immigration. Given the potency of those cultural issues, \u201cI\u2019m not sure [Biden] can spend his way to a larger vote share there,\u201d Kochel says. I think Biden\u2019s doing what he can, but these voters lean right on culture and immigration: He\u2019s leaning left on those issues and that holds him back. I don\u2019t think the modern Democratic Party, with its vocal cultural left, can win 40% of non-college whites [again] absent a big GOP misstep. Henry Olsen, senior fellow, Ethics and Public Policy Center Another headwind for Biden, he adds, is the rise in inflation, which Republicans are attributing to his expensive spending proposals. \u201cInflation and the overall cost of living is going to bite the non-college working class a heck of a lot more than it is the white-collar upscale college grads,\u201d Kochel says. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of things working against him that he doesn\u2019t have much control over.\u201d Henry Olsen, a senior fellow at the conservative Ethics and Public Policy Center who studies blue-collar voters, is also dubious that Biden can regain much ground. \u201cI think Biden\u2019s doing what he can, but these voters lean right on culture and immigration: He\u2019s leaning left on those issues and that holds him back,\u201d Olsen told me in an email. \u201cI don\u2019t think the modern Democratic Party, with its vocal cultural left, can win 40% of non-college whites [again] absent a big GOP misstep.\u201d Ruy Teixeira, a veteran Democratic analyst now at the Center for American Progress, agrees that economic issues will take Democrats only so far. Biden\u2019s \u201ctheory of the case is that we are going to deliver for the masses of honest workers in America \u2026 and the people who don\u2019t like us, the suspicious non-college White voters, are going to be able to overcome their cultural reservations about the party,\u201d says Teixeira, who has written extensively on the evolving Democratic coalition. \u201cBut the theory that you can just do good economics stuff and ignore the rest \u2026 is probably mistaken.\u201d Fact-checking Republican attempts to blame inflation on Democrats Teixeira believes Biden\u2019s strategy of downplaying cultural issues is insufficient: He argues that the President must more explicitly reject the left\u2019s positions on issues such as crime, much as Bill Clinton did during the 1990s. Biden has taken some steps in that direction, particularly in publicly rejecting calls to \u201cdefund the police.\u201d But in a coalition that is far less dependent on working-class Whites than it was in Bill Clinton\u2019s era \u2013 and far more reliant on people of color and well-educated White social liberals \u2013 Biden simply cannot move as aggressively as Clinton did to signal sympathy for the culturally conservative views that bind so many blue-collar voters to the GOP. And that means the ceiling on Biden\u2019s potential recovery with blue-collar White voters, whatever economic agenda he passes, is probably lower than he hopes, though not necessarily lower than it takes to improve his position in some closely contested states. \u201cPeople think\u201d the effort to gain the electoral high ground for 2022 and 2024 \u201cis going to happen through one swift katana move,\u201d says McElwee, referring to the sleek Japanese sword favored by samurai, \u201cwhen in fact it\u2019s a really brutal game of inches.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Gabby Cipollone loves her home state of West Virginia. But the 23-year-old says that isn\u2019t the case for many young West Virginians. \u201cOur population is fleeing,\u201d Cipollone said, adding that many of her friends and even her sister have left West Virginia \u2013 a state that she says has felt the impact of the opioid epidemic and a struggling coal mining industry. \u201c[My friends] cite a lack of opportunity and a lack of feeling that their opinion, voice or vote matters,\u201d she said. Still, amid the national conversation on voting rights, the state has become a focus because of Sen. Joe Manchin, whose vote is critical to Democrats\u2019 ability to pass voting rights legislation in Congress. That matters to young people there, Cipollone says, because increasing voter accessibility would help address the various issues plaguing the state. West Virginia is one of the three US states with a shrinking population, according to US Census data. The state\u2019s population is aging, and more people died than were born in West Virginia between 2010 and 2020. Simultaneously, West Virginia witnessed a higher pace of migration out of the state than it had in prior decades and as a result of its population loss, the state is losing a House seat in 2022. Manchin in recent weeks has been part of a group of Senate Democrats \u2013 including Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York, Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota and Sen. Raphael Warnock of Georgia \u2013 working to craft a revised voting rights bill compromise aimed at continuing their work on the issue after Senate Republicans blocked Democrats\u2019 sweeping voting and elections reform legislation, the so-called For the People Act, from advancing. As part of Un-PAC West Virginia, the local branch of a national youth-led voting rights advocacy group and political action committee, Cipollone and other Un-PAC organizers have sought to locally raise awareness about the need for federal voting rights reform. Since May, the young organizers have knocked on doors across the state, with a goal of getting West Virginians of all ages to contact Manchin to express their concern. With voting rights legislation stalled in Congress, Cipollone and other young organizers in West Virginia have ramped up their advocacy efforts, encouraging as many West Virginians as possible to contact their senators to push for the For the People Act. Manchin has said he wouldn\u2019t rule out supporting a modified version of the bill, and proposed updated legislation that declares Election Day a public holiday, expands early voting to at least 15 consecutive days and bans partisan gerrymandering. But in return for his crucial support, Manchin wants to require ID \u2013 or an alternative form of identification such as a utility bill \u2013 to vote. Organizers told CNN they are receptive to Manchin\u2019s proposed changes. \u201cI think there are good things in what\u2019s being called the Manchin compromise,\u201d said David Crawley, the 27-year-old West Virginia state director for Un-PAC. \u201cIf there is going to be a voter ID system, allow it to be accessible,\u201d Crawley said, adding that all citizens should be able to easily obtain an ID. \u201cI don\u2019t want [this bill] not to pass. Work on it, improve it. But at the end of the day, pass it,\u201d he said. Crawley has spent days door knocking in southern West Virginia, an area he described as \u201cleft behind\u201d and \u201cdying\u201d in the wake of a formerly booming coal mining industry. Although the For the People Act was drafted by Democratic members of Congress, Crawley \u2013 who has engaged in conversation with Trump supporters \u2013 says pieces of the legislation have bipartisan support. According to Crawley, the majority of people he has spoken to are in favor of voting reforms such as increased early voting options, adding that constituents in West Virginia across the political spectrum are also receptive to getting money out of politics and limiting the influence of lobbyists. \u201cPeople have been receptive to the idea of a national standard for elections, as most people realize the system doesn\u2019t ensure that everyone has equal access to the polls,\u201d he said. \u201cThis isn\u2019t just people who voted for Democrats, but people who voted for Trump.\u201d For his part, Chris Deluca, a 20-year-old Republican, said he is organizing with Un-PAC because making voting easier is \u201cnecessary\u201d so that more people can participate in the electoral process. \u201cYou see a lot of people who will complain about what\u2019s going on in the country but they don\u2019t vote,\u201d Deluca, a student at West Virginia University, said. \u201cI believe it should be easier because there are so many people that don\u2019t want to.\u201d According to Deluca, the goal of his organizing is to get both Manchin and Republican Sen. Shelley Moore Capito to support federal voting rights legislation.   Deluca said he\u2019s also on board with Manchin\u2019s suggestions for the bill, but only if all Americans are able to access identification for free and proposed granting every American citizen a free state issued ID. \u201cI think as long as we can ensure that all Americans have access to some type of ID for free we should definitely require some ID,\u201d Deluca said. Beyond Un-Pac West Virginia, organizers with Young West Virginia Forward, a youth-led racial justice organization, have for months worked to send a message to both Manchin and Capito that increasing voter accessibility is something that will benefit the lives of young West Virginians. Takeiya Smith, the 27-year-old founder of Young West Virginia Forward, identified job infrastructure, support for young entrepreneurs and the criminal justice system as areas in her community that need improvement. \u201cThere are young West Virginians that want to stay here to fight for a better place to call home, but we can\u2019t do that without the ability to vote for the changes we want to see. Our right to vote is how we access the power needed to positively impact our communities,\u201d she said. \u201cWe\u2019ve talked up over 1,000 people asking them to call Senator Manchin or email Senator Manchin. We\u2019re counting on both Manchin and Capito to do the right thing,\u201d said Smith. \u201cNo matter where you stand on the political spectrum everyone should have the fair and free right to participate in our democracy.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Texas Gov. Greg Abbott has escalated the Republican push to pass new voting restrictions in the state, announcing on Thursday a second special session of the state legislature that could continue the bitter standoff with Democrats in the Texas House who broke quorum and fled to the nation\u2019s capital to prevent action on the bill. The move, which will force Texas Democrats to decide whether to remain out of state for another month, comes as voting rights groups step up their pressure on Democrats in Washington to find a way forward on federal legislation to counteract the raft of new state laws that make it harder to vote. As the lobbying intensifies, Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer has indicated to Democratic senators that votes could come soon on voting rights, according to two Democratic sources. But events remain fluid. And it\u2019s unclear whether a small group of Democratic senators, who have been negotiating behind the scenes on a streamlined voting measure, will reach a final agreement on a new bill before the Senate leaves for its August recess. Voting rights groups, meanwhile, are trying to increase their pressure on the White House and congressional Democrats to do away with the Senate\u2019s filibuster, a procedural tool that requires a 60-vote threshold to advance most legislation in the chamber. A new TV commercial from a Democratic group calls on President Joe Biden to take more aggressive action to pass federal voting legislation. End Citizens United/Let America Vote Action Fund said it plans to spend $1 million on the ad campaign. The commercial invokes the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.\u2019s criticism of the filibuster and implores Biden to \u201cplease tell the Senate: Reform the filibuster. Everything is at stake.\u201d Biden has called the raft of new voting restrictions a \u201c21st Century Jim Crow assault\u201d on voting rights, but he has not publicly advocated dismantling the filibuster that Senate Republicans deployed in June to block consideration of the Democrats\u2019 sweeping voting rights bill, dubbed the For the People Act. \u201cThis moment calls for Presidential leadership, and we\u2019re asking President Biden to fight like heck and use every tool available to him, including using his relationships in the Senate, to call for a reform to the filibuster to protect this sacred right,\u201d Tiffany Muller, president of End Citizens United and Let America Vote Action Fund, said in a statement. Another group, the New Georgia Project Action Fund, said it\u2019s launching a $500,000 ad campaign on Hulu, Instagram and other digital platforms to encourage voters of color to call their senators to demand action on federal election legislation. A handful of Democratic senators now are working on a pared-down version of a voting rights bill, but no language has been released yet. A more substantive debate on voting legislation in the Senate might not happen until the fall \u2013 as the voting legislation has taken a back burner to other priorities, including the roughly $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure bill now making its way through the Senate. Democrats in the House, meanwhile, have labored for weeks on a new version of their legislation to restore parts of the Voting Rights Act that were gutted by the US Supreme Court in 2013. On Friday, the House Administration Subcommittee on Elections will release a report summarizing its findings from the hearings it has hosted on voting rights and racial discrimination at the ballot box. The report is an important step in the House\u2019s preparations to introduce its new version of its Voting Rights Act bill, known as the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act or HR 4. The bill \u2013 which is not expected to be reintroduced for at least a few more weeks \u2013 seeks to restore the so-called preclearance requirement, weakened by the nation\u2019s high court in its 2013 Shelby County v Holder decision. Before that decision, certain states and jurisdictions needed to get federal approval for changes to their voting practices. If the John Lewis bill becomes law, it will undoubtedly be challenged in court. And the report being released Friday will be part of the record that its defenders will point to as they argue for its constitutionality. For now, the effort to advance the legislation travels to the Judiciary Committee, which will usher the bill onto the House floor once it\u2019s reintroduced. So far, 30 news laws restricting voting have been enacted this year in 18 states, according to the Brennan Center for Justice. Republican efforts to pass a far-reaching bill in Texas have been thwarted twice by state Democratic lawmakers. In May, just before the end of the year\u2019s regular legislative session, Democratic legislators walked off the state House floor, leaving Texas Republicans without the quorum they needed to approve the voting legislation in the final hours before a midnight deadline. Then, Texas state House Democrats stalled action during an initial special session when they broke quorum and flew to Washington, DC. More than 50 Democrats have remained out of the state since July 12. Abbott\u2019s proclamation Thursday announcing another special session included \u201celection integrity\u201d among the items on the agenda. This second special session is slated to begin at noon Saturday, twelve hours after the first special session is set to end. \u201cI will continue to call special session after special session to reform our broken bail system, uphold election integrity, and pass other important items that Texans demand and deserve,\u201d Abbott said in a statement. At least one Texas Democratic lawmaker struck a defiant tone on Thursday. In a statement to CNN, Texas Rep. Ron Reynolds vowed to \u201cstay off the House floor to deny a quorum until Governor Abbott drops the voter suppression from his agenda.\u201d Texas Rep. Gina Hinojosa, an Austin Democrat, declined to discuss the lawmakers\u2019 future strategy in detail but told CNN that Texas Democrats \u201care as determined as ever to fight this second suppression session with as much vigor and determination.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re using every tool we have available now, but we can only hold the line so long in Texas,\u201d she added.  \u201cMy thought is that Congress needs to act now; the Senate needs to act now. The President needs to prioritize voting rights above all other issues.\u201d CNN\u2019s Tierney Sneed contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Four of the Republican candidates vying to replace California Gov. Gavin Newsom in the September 14 recall election met on the debate stage Wednesday night, railing against Covid-19 mask mandates and accusing the Democrat of failing the state\u2019s business owners and school children by forcing closures during the worst of the pandemic. Businessman John Cox, former San Diego Mayor Kevin Faulconer, Assemblyman Kevin Kiley and former Rep. Doug Ose all took part at the forum at the Richard Nixon Presidential Library and Museum in Yorba Linda, largely avoiding taking shots at one another but faulting Newsom\u2019s leadership for everything from the state\u2019s homelessness crisis, to rising crime, to the labor shortage. It was their repeated calls for greater personal responsibility and less \u201cgovernment overreach\u201d to halt the spread of the Covid-19 pandemic that created some of the most striking exchanges of the night \u2013 in part because the hands-off approach they proposed to the pandemic would diverge so sharply from the course that Newsom has taken. The Republican-led recall gained steam last year because many GOP voters were angry about what they perceived as Newsom\u2019s overreach \u2013 and the candidates sought to channel that anger Wednesday night by criticizing what they described as an erratic set of Covid regulations and mandates that they claim crushed businesses. Faulconer, who was elected in San Diego in part because he was able to appeal to both Democrats and Republicans, said he would look into whether the governor has the powers to bar mask mandates in individual school districts and localities. \u201cI do not favor mandates; I favor educate,\u201d Faulconer said. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to mandate your way out of the coronavirus.\u201d Kiley said parents \u201cknow what is best for their kids and they should be making decisions themselves\u201d when asked what he would do to prevent mask mandates for children in schools \u2013 and he suggested California would have fared better last year with fewer restrictions. \u201cTo make the case that California got it right, you also have to make the case that all 49 other states got it wrong, and that\u2019s a case that simply cannot be made on the basis of the data.\u201d He added that the level of harm done to children in California through the closures is still not known. \u201cStates that took a different approach, that followed the science that took a balanced approach, and that trusted their citizens, did a lot better,\u201d Kiley said. Cox downplayed the severity of the virus and called Newsom\u2019s Covid management \u201can absolute disaster\u201d that \u201cresulted in far more danger and far more problems.\u201d Ose said he believes the government \u201cis engaged in a significant overreach of its authority,\u201d including the recent guidance from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention that people should wear masks indoors in hot spot areas, even when they are vaccinated. \u201cI happen to have great faith in the ability of people to make decisions of their own,\u201d Ose said. \u201cThe government overreach has to stop. \u2026 Instead of giving people mandates, we need to give them options,\u201d he said. He suggested that Americans should have the option to move their children to a different school or simply choose to shop at a different store if they don\u2019t agree with mask requirements in place in those locations. Forty-six contenders \u2013 of all parties \u2013 have qualified for the ballot and none has commanded the star power that former Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger, a Republican, did when he was elected in the 2003 recall. But the GOP candidate who has recently captured the most attention among Republican voters and donors after his late entrance to the race, conservative talk show radio host Larry Elder, did not participate in the Fox 11 debate because of a preexisting commitment to a fundraiser in Bakersfield. Newsom and GOP candidate Caitlyn Jenner also declined to take part, the network said. Newsom has found himself in an unexpectedly challenging position in this final stretch of the GOP-led effort to recall him \u2013 just as ballots are about to be mailed out to every California voter mid-August. Covid cases are surging again; the state\u2019s wildfire season began early with ferocity; and California is facing a harrowing drought that has created alarming water shortages and led the governor to declare a drought emergency in 50 of the state\u2019s 58 counties last month, covering 42% of the state\u2019s population. Voters will be asked two questions on the ballot: First, yes or no on whether they want to recall Newsom and second, select from a list of candidates to replace him. Though Newsom has maintained a strong approval rating \u2013 with a July survey by the Public Policy Institute of California showing that 56% of likely voters approved of his leadership on jobs and the economy; and 59% approved of his handling of environmental issues \u2013 polls have consistently shown that the overwhelming energy in this special election lies on the GOP side. That has left Newsom allies with a difficult task in these final weeks: generate enough Democratic enthusiasm \u2013 or gin up fear of the alternative \u2013 to move their voters to fill out their ballots supporting the governor and send them back. Democratic voters outnumber Republicans nearly two to one in California. But in interviews on Wednesday, more than half-a-dozen California political strategists noted that it is virtually impossible to predict what the universe of likely voters will be for a special election on a random date in September in the middle of a pandemic when every voter has a ballot on their kitchen table. (To slow the spread of Covid, Newsom signed a law in February extending the state\u2019s rule that every registered voter would receive a mail-in ballot for any election this year). There are no high-profile Democrats challenging Newsom and the governor\u2019s labor supporters are heavily involved in the effort to invigorate reliable Democratic voters, urging them to take the recall threat seriously. Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren is starring in an anti-recall television spot, tying the effort to recall Newsom with attempts by supporters of former President Donald Trump to reverse the 2020 election results and attack the right to vote, warning that \u201cnow they are coming to grab power in California.\u201d California Democratic strategist Michael Trujillo worries that the resurgence of Covid cases due to the Delta variant has made the final grassroots push unexpectedly difficult. \u201cThe biggest challenge is finding the volunteers to knock on doors and the voters to open them,\u201d Trujillo said. \u201cWhen you go from thinking we had suffocated the pandemic to realizing we hadn\u2019t, it means that running an effective field campaign in California is slowly being taken off the table for Democrats. Our volunteers are Covid-sensitive, our voters are Covid-sensitive.\u201d He noted that the most effective way to engage the voters Democrats need most in communities of color is with repeated door-knocks to educate them about the ballot. \u201cIf the number of volunteers that are willing to do that is diminished and the number of voters willing to open their doors is diminished \u2013 you have a real problem communicating why this election is so important,\u201d he said. The GOP contenders largely focused on their ideological differences with Newsom and sought to blame him for some of the deep systemic problems that have faced California for decades, including the way housing costs have squeezed middle class families \u2013 leading some to leave the state. Seizing on one of the hot-button topics that is at the top of the Republican agenda nationally, Faulconer accused Newsom of \u201cenabling\u201d the \u201cdefund the police\u201d movement and faulted him for supporting Proposition 47 in 2014, which reclassified some theft and drug possession offenses from felonies to misdemeanors. \u201cI\u2019ve seen the disasters of these policies on the streets throughout this great state of ours, it\u2019s time to have a governor who is going to put victims first,\u201d Faulconer said. \u201cEvery California family deserves to be safe, to feel safe and to have a safe neighborhood. That is not the reality under Gavin Newsom\u2019s California.\u201d In the midst of a series of meetings on racial injustice in policing last year, Newsom spoke about \u201creimagining\u201d policing, but made it clear that he did not support eliminating police departments. The candidates also had a robust debate over how to handle the deepening crisis of homelessness in California. Cox lamented the number of tents along the streets in San Diego and pledged to take a more forceful approach, which would likely require changes to the law: \u201cIf we have to, we\u2019re gonna force people to get into treatment.\u201d Faulconer said the housing crisis that has thrust so many people out on to the streets is also taking an economic toll: \u201cPeople are leaving California, they are voting with their feet. \u2026 And the reality is that we have a governor who doesn\u2019t seem to think that it\u2019s a problem.\u201d The governor\u2019s team has portrayed the recall effort as a zealous mission led by Trump acolytes \u2013 and Wednesday night\u2019s debate was no exception. Newsom strategist Dan Newman described the face-off as \u201canother proof point that California faces a very clear choice between (Newsom) and installing a Trump-supporting Republican as governor.\u201d Newman said Elder\u2019s late entrance to the race within a field of little-known and little-noticed candidates has clarified the choice for voters. \u201cHe unapologetically opposes Roe v. Wade, supports Trump, says the minimum wage should be $0.00, and that we should be drilling for oil off the California coast. That\u2019s what\u2019s at stake,\u201d Newman said. \u201cOur challenge is to make sure that California voters understand that binary choice.\u201d For his part, Newsom has made a point of appearing to focus on his day job \u2013 traveling the state to highlight his administration\u2019s response to wildfires, for example, and promising that California will have the \u201cstrongest state vaccine verification system in the US\u201d after announcing that the state will require state employees and health care workers provide proof of vaccination or submit to regular testing. \u201cHe\u2019s dealing with a number of crises side by side,\u201d said Mark Baldassare, president and CEO of the Public Policy Institute of California. \u201cThe way these crises are handled over the next month and a half will weigh on how people think about whether it\u2019s important for them to weigh in on the recall and do they want to keep this current governor.\u201d Finding a way to draw Democrats into that discussion and getting them committed to participate remains the biggest hurdle for the Newsom campaign, Baldassare said. \u201cThus far, they haven\u2019t found a way to really engage their core constituents \u2013 and at this point the election is really going to be determined by that.\u201d",

            "article_content": "A pair of special election primaries in Ohio on Tuesday will put the spotlight on tough questions facing both parties ahead of next year\u2019s midterm elections. In the state\u2019s heavily Democratic 11th Congressional District, centered in Cleveland, voters are poised to choose between a progressive champion with close ties to Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders and a moderate county party leader backed by the national establishment. Down in the GOP-leaning 15th Congressional District, Republicans are looking at a possible replay of last week\u2019s special election in Texas, where former President Donald Trump\u2019s endorsement wasn\u2019t enough to sway the race to his chosen candidate. Trump is, once again, facing a test of his influence \u2013 especially with suburban voters \u2013 and questions over his decision to wade into the race at all. Neither result is expected to have much tangible influence on the doings of the current Congress \u2013 the 11th district is a sure bet to stay blue, while the 15th is almost as likely to remain red and the general election isn\u2019t until November \u2013 but voters, as they sift through millions of dollars of outside ads, have the opportunity to send a message to leadership in both parties about the kind of candidates they might favor in 2022. Polls close at 7:30 p.m ET. Ohio\u2019s 11th District race has turned into a proxy war, with the generational and ideological fissures that are simmering within the Democratic Party \u2013 but have remained largely hidden in the early months of Joe Biden\u2019s presidency \u2013 bursting into full view. High-profile surrogates have converged on the district, an overwhelmingly Democratic territory that stretches from Cleveland to Akron. Sanders and New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez campaigned for Nina Turner in the race\u2019s closing days. South Carolina Rep. Jim Clyburn and other members of the Congressional Black Caucus fanned out across Cleveland for Shontel Brown. Clyburn was a kingmaker in the 2020 Democratic presidential primary, when his endorsement catapulted Biden to an overwhelming win in the South Carolina primary \u2013 a victory that set Biden on course to deliver the knockout blow against Sanders days later on Super Tuesday. And in Cleveland over the weekend, Clyburn made clear that his goal was to deliver Biden another ally in Congress and deprive the progressive \u201cSquad\u201d from adding another member and tilting the balance of power within the House Democratic Caucus. \u201cI don\u2019t understand why people think that the entire agenda has got to be yours. That\u2019s not the way the world works,\u201d Clyburn told CNN. \u201cWe have to sit down, find common ground, reconcile the differences and move an agenda forward. That\u2019s what this President is doing and that\u2019s why he\u2019s been so successful.\u201d Progressives have zeroed in on districts like this \u2013 overwhelmingly Democratic, where the primary typically decides the general election winner \u2013 since 2018, when Ocasio-Cortez unseated then-Rep. Joe Crowley in New York. Over the last two election cycles, they have added to their congressional ranks with a series of successful primary challenges. But victory for Turner, the former state senator and a leading Sanders supporter over two presidential election campaigns, would hit differently. Turner did not emerge from political obscurity to run this race \u2013 she is already a national figure and her fate will ripple out well beyond the district\u2019s borders. Though she has highlighted her past support for figures like former President Barack Obama during the campaign, Turner is beloved on the left. She is viewed as a true believer and, at a time when some progressives are uneasy about the progressives\u2019 alliance with the Biden administration, someone who will not be cowed by pressure from the White House and congressional leadership. Other lefty candidates have amassed endorsements from allied groups, but few have attracted the kind of in-person surge of surrogate support that has cycled through Cleveland over the past few weeks. Ocasio-Cortez visited two weekends ago, former NAACP president Ben Jealous has been on the ground, and Sanders, along with Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison and racial justice activist Cornel West, appeared for get-out-the-vote events over the last few days. Ocasio-Cortez and Sanders delivered unusually personal pleas for Democrats to elevate Turner \u2013 and deliver them a trusted ally for the intra-party clashes ahead. \u201cWe need Nina. I need Nina,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez said during her visit. \u201cPlease send me Nina!\u201d Sanders on Saturday struck a similar note: \u201cI would have come (to the district) because Nina is a close personal friend of mine and somebody I admire,\u201d he said. \u201cBut the real reason I am here is that we desperately need her in the US Congress.\u201d A week after a Trump-endorsed Republican lost a runoff for a congressional seat in Texas, the value of the former President\u2019s endorsement will be put to another test in Ohio\u2019s 15th District GOP primary. Trump endorsed coal lobbyist Mike Carey in the race to replace former Rep. Steve Stivers, who resigned to take a job with the Ohio Chamber of Commerce. A pro-Trump super PAC has pumped $350,000 into adds backing Carey. But Carey is facing a crowded field of competitors, including the Stivers-backed state Rep. Jeff LaRe, a former sheriff\u2019s deputy. There are other outside players in the 15th District race, as well: Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul endorsed Ron Hood, a former state lawmaker who has taken up Paul\u2019s criticism of Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation\u2019s leading infectious disease official. And Debbie Meadows, the wife of former Trump chief of staff Mark Meadows, and several other influential conservative activists are aligned with Ruth Edmonds, a former Columbus NAACP president. Special elections are a volatile political atmosphere: Candidates have had only a few months to raise money and campaign. Turnout is likely to be only a small fraction of what the district would see in a midterm or presidential election year. And a crowded field can split even that small share of votes. Polls show an overwhelming share of Republicans remain supportive of Trump. But, now that he is out of office, what\u2019s less clear is whether the party\u2019s voters are eager to purge their ranks of those who aren\u2019t aligned with Trump \u2013 a clear goal of the former President in next year\u2019s midterm elections. Ohio\u2019s 15th District will provide the latest test of how closely Republican voters are willing to follow Trump. No matter the outcome on Tuesday, analysts will be quick to dig into the numbers and study how Carey fared in the Columbus suburbs, which include sections of Fairfield and Franklin counties, and are home to about half of the district\u2019s registered voters. Trump\u2019s overall margin in the district improved during his second run, but a closer look shows \u2013 perhaps unsurprisingly \u2013 that the slight uptick was fueled by stronger numbers in its more rural communities. The 2020 results out of Franklin County \u2013 home to Columbus and its suburbs \u2013 offer some insight into Trump\u2019s soft spot. The former President lost the county in both his elections, with similar shares voting for him, but support for the Democratic nominee jumped from Hillary Clinton\u2019s 59.8% in 2016 to 64.9% for Biden last year. It\u2019s not an apples-to-apples indicator, because only parts of Columbus fall inside the congressional district\u2019s boundaries, but if Carey does poorly in the suburbs, Republicans will have more reason to worry about candidates facing similar electorates \u2013 the exact kind they need to win over in order to claim a House majority in 2022. Whether that kind of warning sign will be enough to convince some swing district Republican candidates to stray from Trump, even if only on his election lies, remains to be seen. But Carey\u2019s performance among a very small set of voters within what\u2019s anticipated to be a low turnout election could have an outsized impact on the big races to come.",

            "article_content": "There comes a point in every awful horror movie where a character does something so careless and shortsighted a viewer loses faith in the storyteller. There\u2019s the hapless victim who can\u2019t flee from the monster without falling, the stubborn homeowner who won\u2019t move out of a haunted house, and my favorite: the person who walks toward, not away, from a sinister noise at night while asking, \u201cHello, is anyone there?\u201d As I watch some Democrats handle the voting rights issue, I\u2019m seeing a replay of a 19th-century political horror story. It ended with Black voters losing faith in the leaders who were supposed to protect them. President Biden has called voting rights \u201cthe single most important\u201d issue and described a wave of voter restriction bills recently passed by Republican legislatures across the US as \u201cJim Crow on steroids.\u201d Yet he has refused to throw the full weight of the Oval Office behind passing two pending voting rights bills in Congress. He has stopped short of embracing calls to jettison the filibuster \u2013 the parliamentary tactic Republicans can use to halt a voting rights bill \u2013 because he says it would \u201cthrow the entire Congress into chaos.\u201d   He\u2019s focused instead on passing a bipartisan infrastructure bill that could rejuvenate the economy and appeal to a broad swath of voters. But for anyone who knows this country\u2019s shameful voting rights history, Biden is following a script that once doomed Black voters and made the rise of Jim Crow possible. Biden and Democratic leaders who prioritize infrastructure in part to broaden their appeal to reluctant White supporters are making the same mistake White political allies of Black voters made in the late 19th century. That\u2019s when the more progressive American political party of that era \u2013 the Republican Party \u2013 abandoned Black voters to focus on an economic agenda that emphasized infrastructure and uniting a country that was bitterly divided by race. That blunder gave us a century of Jim Crow segregation, reduced the Republican Party to a \u201cdying institution\u201d \u2018in the South and forced countless Black Americans to confront an uncomfortable truth that many are now facing again: Our White political allies are rarely willing to match the intensity and cunning of our political opponents. Evoking Jim Crow may cause some people to cringe because the comparison seems overblown. No White vigilantes are gunning down or lynching would-be Black voters. No White mobs are brazenly murdering Black elected officials or launching what\u2019s been described as the nation\u2019s only successful coup \u2013 against a Southern city filled with Black leaders. All of this happened during that era. But there are two lessons today\u2019s Democratic leaders can learn from the mistakes their White counterparts made in the late 19th century: Economic appeals to White voters driven by racial resentment have limited value. And when you refuse to go all out to protect your most loyal voters, the results can be disastrous. These aren\u2019t abstract lessons for me. I am a Black voter in Georgia, the epicenter of the new voting rights struggle. I watched Black voters save Biden\u2019s presidency during his primary run last year.  I glowed with pride when he picked Kamala Harris, my classmate at Howard University, to be his vice president. I watched Black voters flood voting precincts in a pandemic and honk their horns in jubilation after they delivered the Oval Office and control of Congress to the Democrats. What I am seeing now, though, is a rising sense of betrayal among Black voters. Many don\u2019t think Democratic leaders are pushing hard enough on voting rights. More are frustrated by Democratic leaders like Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, who says he won\u2019t support gutting the filibuster and insists on Republican buy-in to support a new voting rights bill. (He did propose a compromise on voting rights legislation that won the support of voting rights activist Stacey Abrams.) Leonard Pitts Jr., a Pulitzer Prize winning columnist, captured some of this bitterness when he called Manchin\u2019s reasoning \u201cnonsensical.\u201d Pitts also alluded to the \u201cFor the People Act,\u201d a bill to expand voting rights, when he posed a rhetorical question to Manchin: \u201cWould you decline to support a For the Chickens Act solely because the foxes refused to sign on?\u201d A Black voter who voted Republican in the late 19th-century South could have related to some of Pitts\u2019 sarcasm. Black voters in the South were then the most loyal supporters of the Republican Party. The Republicans were the party of Abraham Lincoln, the \u201cGreat Emancipator,\u201d and the driving force behind Reconstruction, which lasted roughly from 1865 to 1877. It was the nation\u2019s first genuine attempt to build a multiracial democracy. Those Republicans were strong supporters of Black voting rights. Black Americans were so loyal to the party that Frederick Douglass, the abolitionist and civil rights icon, once said, \u201cThe Republican Party is the ship and all else is the sea around us.\u201d But as White resistance to Reconstruction grew, the Republican Party gradually began to treat Black voters as castaways. GOP leaders said that the party shouldn\u2019t become too dependent on Black voters and should craft an economic message that would appeal to more White voters, says Richard White, author of \u201cThe Republic for Which it Stands,\u201d an acclaimed book that explores US history from Reconstruction to the end of the 19th century. A central part of Republicans\u2019 economic message to reluctant White voters was infrastructure: They vowed to rebuild the roads, railways and ports throughout the South. \u201cThey said we\u2019re going to give you economic opportunity,\u201d says White, a professor of American history at Stanford University. \u201cWe\u2019re going to build an economic infrastructure you can use. You are going to be able to increase your standard of living. And that\u2019s why you\u2019re going to join the Republican Party.\u201d That approach didn\u2019t work in the South. Racism trumped economics. Many White Southerners from the Civil War generation saw the Republican Party as \u201can alien embodiment of wartime defeat and black equality,\u201d the historian Eric Foner said in his classic book on that era, \u201cReconstruction: America\u2019s Unfinished Revolution.\u201d White resistance to Black voting rights ground down the will of many Republican leaders. Black political power was crushed by a combination of White terrorism, a wave of voter suppression laws and an indifferent Supreme Court that turned a blind eye to injustice. Reconstruction roughly ended with the disputed presidential contest of 1876. An election too close to call was resolved after candidate Rutherford B. Hayes agreed to a backroom deal that resulted in him pulling troops out of the South in exchange for the presidency. The Republican Party ceased being a major player in the South. Democrats became so dominant that the region became known as the \u201cSolid South.\u201d What followed was a century of Jim Crow segregation throughout the South that only ended with the rise of the civil rights movement in the mid-1960s. That\u2019s when the Democratic Party began attracting massive numbers of Black voters because of its support for civil rights. The reasons why Reconstruction ended are complicated. But one lesson contemporary Democratic leaders should take from that era is simple: An economic appeal to White voters consumed by racial grievances can only go so far. Many Southern White voters were willing to sacrifice the economic benefits of Reconstruction \u2013 the regions\u2019 first public schools, rebuilt roads and railroads, the construction of public hospitals \u2013 to prevent what some called \u201cNegro Rule.\u201d White, the historian, says Democratic leaders touting the crossover appeal of the infrastructure bill \u201csound like moderate Republicans during Reconstruction.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s why I think the infrastructure argument is ridiculous, because in the South they were more than willing to hurt themselves if in fact they could hurt Black people more,\u201d White says. That impulse among some White voters survives today. Look at the resistance to Obamacare. The Democratic Party\u2019s passage of a national health care law that helps many struggling White families did not turn many conservative White voters into Democrats. Many red states still won\u2019t accept the Medicaid expansion under Obamacare despite the financial and health benefits. Or consider the impact of Biden dispatching stimulus checks to White voters. A Washington Post reporter recently traveled to an impoverished, rural Ohio county whose White voters overwhelmingly voted for former President Trump. Though virtually all of them said they benefited from Biden\u2019s stimulus checks, virtually none said the help would lead them to support Democrats. The lesson: Building a new road won\u2019t build a new bridge to reluctant White voters who despise Blacks. The White political allies of Black voters made another big mistake that Democrats may be making now. They\u2019re forgetting to \u201cDance With the One That Brought You.\u201d That\u2019s the title of a song by country music star Shania Twain. The title also reflects a popular sports expression which advises coaches to stick with the players that helped them win. The Republican Party in the 19th century ignored that rationale. Black voters in the South were crucial to Republicans\u2019 success in the early days of Reconstruction. They were the party\u2019s most loyal supporters. At one point in the late 19th century, there were an estimated 2,000 Black Republicans holding office throughout the South. As White resistance to Reconstruction mounted, though, Republican Party leaders shifted their emphasis from racial equality to big business. \u201cRepublicans started taking the Black vote for granted, and the Republican Party were always divided,\u201d the historian, Foner, said in a USA Today interview. \u201cThere were those who said, \u2018We got to really defend the Black vote in the South.\u2019 And others said, \u2018No, we\u2019ve got to appeal to the business-minded voter in the South as the party of business, the party of growth.\u201d Many Black supporters of the Republican Party felt betrayed. They were the backbone of the GOP in the South but watched Republican leaders do nothing as Black Southerners were being slaughtered while trying to vote. Henry Adams, an ex-slave who fought for the Union in the Civil War, once told congressional investigators in 1880: \u201cThe whole South \u2014 every State in the South \u2014 had got into the hands of the very men that held us slaves.\u201d When a political party allows its political opponents to restrict access to the vote, the impact can last for multiple generations. That happened in the Jim Crow South. The US didn\u2019t become a genuine democracy until the passage of the 1965 Voting Rights Act. Voting rights advocates warn that some version of a Jim Crow 2.0 could repeat itself today \u2013 minus the raw violence but with an array of new tactics that restrict voting by Black Americans. Nse Ufot, a voting rights advocate in Georgia, said that if Democratic leaders can\u2019t replicate the staggering turnout from last November\u2019s presidential election, then \u201cWe\u2019re f\u2014ed.\u201d She used another f-word when she talked about Biden\u2019s recent speech on voting rights. \u201cWhen I think about the f-word that cannot be said on television, I didn\u2019t think it was the filibuster,\u201d she told me. Ufot says she and other Black voters have often felt that the Democratic Party takes their vote for granted. Many now also face the dilemma Black voters faced in the late 19th century South \u2013 the alternative is worse. They can\u2019t envision voting for today\u2019s Republican Party, which they view as dominated by White supremacists. Still, some Black voters could make a third choice that should frighten Democrats: to not vote at all. Ufot says if the voting rights bill fails, many Black voters in swing states like Georgia may wonder if standing in long lines and taking time off for work to navigate a thicket of voting restrictions is worth it. \u201cWe run the risk of people withdrawing from the process because the cost of participation is too high and they don\u2019t feel like any party represents their interests and will fight for their agenda and priorities,\u201d she says. Black voters won\u2019t be the only ones hurt if Democratic leaders don\u2019t go all out to protect voting rights. The party itself could suffer from a modern version of the death spiral that doomed Republicans in the Jim Crow South. If the Democratic Party doesn\u2019t pass new voting protections, it could lose the House, Senate and White House within the next four years, says Ronald Brownstein, a senior political analyst at CNN, in a recent Atlantic magazine essay. He says the country is facing a \u2018turning point\u201d in the voting rights battle that will determine whether its democracy \u201cgrows more inclusive or exclusionary.\u201d He writes that Republican voter restrictions \u201camount to stacking sandbags against a rising tide of demographic change\u201d and that millennials and Gen Zers represent the most racially diverse generation in American history. If Republicans eventually impose red state voting rules on blue states, Democrats may not be able to pass national voting rights rules \u201cfor another 50 years,\u201d said one Democratic senator quoted in Brownstein\u2019s essay. For Democrats, passing a new voting rights bill is a question of survival, Elie Mystal, a writer with The Nation magazine, said during a recent interview with Slate. \u201cThere are entirely too many Democratic senators and establishment folks who do not see the existential threat to their own jobs if these voter suppression laws are allowed to stand,\u201d she said. \u201cThey think they can still convince that middle-of-the-road White person that left the party during the Reagan years\u2026 They don\u2019t understand that the base of their party is these Black and brown people who turn out for them. They don\u2019t understand that they cannot win if they do not have overwhelming turnout from Black and brown communities.\u201d Other voting rights advocates are less pessimistic. They say that voter suppression laws aimed at Black voters can sometimes backfire. \u201cBlack people have a history \u2013 when you make us mad, we turn out,\u201d says Timothy McDonald, an Atlanta pastor who founded the African American Ministers Leadership Council, the group which created the \u201cSouls to the Polls\u201d get-out-the-vote movement among Black churches nationwide. McDonald says it\u2019s time to do away with the filibuster if it\u2019s used to stop a new voting rights bill. But he also supports the Biden administration\u2019s focus on passing what could possibly be two major infrastructure bills. New construction offers tangible signs of progress that could even cause some White, conservative voters to switch their votes to Democrats, he says. \u201cEven Bubba might say, \u2018I don\u2019t like Democrats,\u2019 but that\u2019s a good thing there,\u201d says, McDonald, referring to infrastructure improvements such as new roads and bridges. \u201cWhen he goes into the voting booth, he\u2019s not going to tell his buddies who he\u2019s voting for but don\u2019t be surprised.\u201d But the expectation that Blacks can counter voter suppression by turning out in record numbers amounts to a cruel double standard, Michael Arceneaux argued in a recent column for The Week entitled, \u201cBiden\u2019s voting rights betrayal.\u201d \u201cWhite voters are never asked to \u2018out-organize vote suppression,\u201d he wrote. As I hear Democratic leaders rationalize why now is the wrong time to get rid of the filibuster or push aggressively for voting rights, a question comes to my mind: When did White political allies of Black people ever say the time was \u201cright\u201d for us to demand our equal rights? The time wasn\u2019t right to reclaim Black voting rights in the South until Americans were horrified by images of White state troopers beating marchers in Selma in 1965. The time wasn\u2019t right to press for police reforms until Americans were horrified by the video of George Floyd being murdered on camera in 2020. The time isn\u2019t right to get rid of the filibuster and pass a new voting rights bill now, even though a recent Pew Research Center survey revealed that 48% of White Americans now say that voting is a \u201cprivilege,\u201d not a right. Politics, it\u2019s been said, is the art of the possible. But determined political leaders can often make things happen if they\u2019re passionate enough. The Democratic Party used to know this. When a senator warned President Lyndon Johnson that if he pushed for the passage of the 1964 Civil Rights Act the Democratic Party would \u201close the South forever,\u201d Johnson\u2019s response was resolute, according to a passage in historian Doris Kearns Goodwin\u2019s book, \u201cLeadership In Turbulent Times.\u201d \u201cYou may be right,\u201d Johnson said. \u201cBut if that\u2019s the price I\u2019ve gotta pay, I\u2019m going to gladly do it.\u201d When it seemed like the passage of Obamacare was doomed, Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi told a nervous Democratic leader who wanted to pursue a less ambitious health plan focused on children that she wasn\u2019t going to settle for \u201ckiddie-care.\u201d There are some issues that are so fundamental to a party\u2019s identity and survival that there is no middle ground, no way to finesse a hard choice. As one voting rights activists recently tweeted: \u201cI am uncompromising on voting rights because there is no middle point between the arsonist and the fireman.\u201d Black voters like Henry Adams, the courageous soldier who tried to organize Black voters in the South, had that attitude. But their White political allies took their vote for granted and treated them, in the words of Frederick Douglass, like \u201cfield hands.\u201d If the Biden administration doesn\u2019t pass a new voting rights bill after Black voters help give them the White House and control of Congress, the sense of jubilation I witnessed firsthand in Georgia will evaporate. And if more White Americans continue to regard voting as a privilege rather than a fundamental right, more Black voters will ask Democratic leaders a variation of a question that was first posed by their ancestors in the Jim Crow South: What\u2019s the use of building a new bridge or road when you don\u2019t protect the voting rights of those people who gave you the power to do so in the first place?",

            "article_content": "The House select committee investigating the January 6 attack on the Capitol kicked off its first high-profile hearing Tuesday with harrowing testimony from officers who experienced firsthand the violent events of that day at the hands of a pro-Trump mob. The vivid testimony puts witness accounts on the record and a national spotlight on the insurrection, once again forcing a reckoning over the tragic events of January 6 for lawmakers on Capitol Hill as well as the American public. Regardless of the testimony\u2019s raw power, entrenched partisan battle lines in the months following the attack and during the shaping of the select committee have ensured that few minds are likely to be changed. Democrats have denounced the Capitol riot as an attack on democracy, while Republicans have almost uniformly downplayed and dismissed the insurrection\u2019s implications, especially former President Donald Trump\u2019s incitement of it. The committee heard gripping and emotional accounts from four officers \u2013 DC Metropolitan Police Officers Daniel Hodges and Michael Fanone and Capitol Police Officer Harry Dunn and Sgt. Aquilino Gonell \u2013 and will use the testimony as a jumping-off point for embarking on a probe that could lead to seeking testimony and documents from the former President, his aides and even Republican members of Congress. The officers described the horrors they witnessed and endured as rioters stormed the building after Trump incited them to do so, and recounted the assault they faced on January 6 \u2013 including being beaten with their own equipment, getting crushed in a doorway, being the target of racial slurs and facing rioters who tased them. Their gripping testimony drove multiple lawmakers on the committee to grow emotional as part of their questioning. \u201cI never expected today to be quite as emotional for me as it has been\u201d said Rep. Adam Kinzinger, one of two Republicans on the committee, who appeared to get choked up during his initial remarks. \u201cI\u2019ve talked to a number of you and gotten to know you.\u201d The witnesses made clear that the trauma and injury of the insurrection have had long-lasting consequences that they are still struggling to deal with now. They spoke of how painful it has been to see attempts to whitewash the insurrection, including by members of Congress, and called for a rigorous investigation to get to the bottom of what happened to ensure it is never repeated. \u201cThe physical violence we experienced was horrific and devastating,\u201d Gonell told the committee. \u201cMy fellow officers and I were punched, kicked, shoved, sprayed with chemical irritants and even blinded with eye-damaging lasers by a violent mob.\u201d \u201cI was particularly shocked at seeing the insurrectionists violently attack us with the very American flag that they claimed they sought to protect,\u201d he said. Fanone said that he was \u201cgrabbed, beaten, tased, all while being called a traitor to my country,\u201d and \u201cwas at risk of being stripped of and killed with my own firearm as I heard chants of \u2018kill him with his own gun.\u2019 I can still hear those words in my head today.\u201d Taking aim at efforts to rewrite the history of the insurrection, he said, \u201cWhat makes the struggle harder and more painful is to know so many of my fellow citizens, including so many of the people I put my life at risk to defend, are downplaying or outright denying what happened.\u201d \u201cI feel like I went to hell and back to protect them and the people in this room, but too many are now telling me that hell doesn\u2019t exist or that hell isn\u2019t that bad,\u201d Fanone said. Visibly upset, he said, \u201cThe indifference shown to my colleagues is disgraceful.\u201d Many Republican fmembers of Congress have sought to downplay the insurrection in the weeks and months since it occurred, even some who forcefully denounced the events in the immediate aftermath of the attack. In one notable example of that, GOP Rep. Andrew Clyde has compared some scenes of the insurrection to a \u201cnormal tourist visit.\u201d Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming, the other Republican lawmaker serving on the committee alongside Kinzinger, said in her opening remarks, \u201cOn January 6 and the days thereafter, almost all members of my party recognized the events of that day for what they actually were,\u201d and then said, \u201cNo member of Congress should now attempt to defend the indefensible, obstruct this investigation or whitewash what happened that day.\u201d In his comments, Kinzinger sought to dismantle misinformation and call out his own party for trying to delegitimize the efforts of the select committee. \u201cFor all the overheated rhetoric surrounding this committee, our mission is very simple: it\u2019s to find the truth and it\u2019s to ensure accountability,\u201d Kinzinger said. \u201cMany in my party have treated this as just another partisan fight. It\u2019s toxic and it\u2019s a disservice.\u201d The hearing started with a warning from Democratic Chairman Bennie Thompson that \u201cwe cannot allow ourselves to be undone by liars and cheaters,\u201d while Cheney, one of two GOP members on the panel, called for prompt enforcement of subpoenas. \u201cThe task of this committee will require persistence,\u201d Cheney said in her opening remarks. \u201cWe must issue and enforce subpoenas promptly. We must get to objective truth. We must overcome the many efforts we are already seeing to cover up and obscure the facts.\u201d In a reference to Trump\u2019s role in January 6, Cheney said it is imperative to \u201cknow what happened every minute of the day in the White House. Every phone call, every conversation, every meeting leading up to, during and after the attack.\u201d At the start of the hearing the committee showed video footage with graphic content depicting the violent storming of the Capitol, including rioters making threats directed at House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and former Vice President Mike Pence. \u201cThese rioters were organized. They were ready for a fight \u2026 they came close to succeeding,\u201d Thompson said in his opening statement. \u201cIt\u2019s frightening to think about how close we were. A few inches of wood and glass. An officer turning left instead of turning right.\u201d As he denounced the \u201cBig Lie\u201d spread by former President Donald Trump that the election was stolen, Thompson said, \u201cWe know that efforts to subvert our democracy are ongoing, and a major part of the Select Committee\u2019s work will be to find ways to eliminate that threat.\u201d Body-camera footage shows how Fanone was pulled into the crowd and tased repeatedly with his own stun gun. Gonell was beaten with a flagpole and his hand was sliced open. Dunn has spoken out about the racist attacks he and other Black officers faced that day. And Hodges was the officer in one of the most harrowing and well-known scenes from the riots, when he was writhing and screaming in pain while crushed in a doorway by a crowd of rioters. \u201cThe two sides were at a stalemate at a metal door frame,\u201d Hodges said during his testimony as he recalled the horrific scene. \u201cI inserted myself so the frame was at my back in an effort to give myself something to brace against,\u201d he said, describing how his arms became pinned and \u201ca man seized the opportunity of my vulnerability, grabbed the front of my gas mask and used it to beat my head against the door.\u201d Hodges described the rioters as \u201cterrorists\u201d and likened the mob to a \u201ccult,\u201d saying at one point during his testimony, \u201cterrorists pushed through the line and engaged us in hand-to hand combat \u2026 one latched onto my face and got his thumb in my right eye, attempting to gouge it out. I cried out in pain and managed to shake him off.\u201d Dunn, who is Black, testified that the rioters repeatedly targeted him with him vicious racial slurs and called him the n-word. \u201cIn the days following the attempted insurrection, other black officers shared with me their own stories of racial abuse on January 6,\u201d he said. At one point, he recalled growing emotional and yelling, \u201cIs this America?\u201d as he began sobbing while other officers tried to console him. Testimony during the hearing underscored how the aftermath of the insurrection continues to have a devastating effect on front-line responders and those who witnessed the events firsthand. Recalling the violence, Fanone said, \u201cDoctors told me that I had suffered a heart attack and I was later diagnosed with a concussion, traumatic brain injury and post-traumatic stress disorder.\u201d \u201cI have been left with the psychological trauma and the emotional anxiety of having survived such a horrific event,\u201d he said. During an interview with CNN\u2019s Don Lemon later Tuesday, Fanone said he had received an angry voicemail with a number of profanities and slurs aimed at him while he was testifying earlier in the day. Dunn said in his testimony, \u201cMore than six months later, January 6 still isn\u2019t over for me \u2026 I\u2019m now receiving private counseling therapy for the persistent emotional trauma of that day.\u201d He added, addressing fellow officers specifically, \u201cThere is absolutely nothing wrong with seeking professional counseling. What we went through that day was traumatic.\u201d At the end of the hearing, Thompson asked the officers what they hope the committee will accomplish. Hodges implored the committee to take action, saying, \u201cAs patrol officers, we can only deal with the crimes that happen on the streets \u2026 you guys are the only ones we\u2019ve got to deal with crimes that occur above us.\u201d \u201cI need you guys to address if anyone in power had a role in this. If anyone in power coordinated, or aided or abetted, or tried to downplay, tried to prevent the investigation of this terrorist attack because we can\u2019t do it.\u201d The emotional testimony marks the start of the committee\u2019s investigation into the circumstances surrounding the attack as Democratic leaders look to set the tone for a panel that congressional Republicans have dismissed as a political sideshow created merely to discredit the legacy of the former President. The hearing will be just the beginning. In the weeks ahead, the panel of seven Democrats and two Republicans, all appointed by House Pelosi, will contend with how they can make the biggest impact, how to choose which documents to seek and, perhaps most importantly, to decide whether they will try to force Trump \u2013 as well as some of their Republican colleagues who spoke to him that day \u2013 to testify. Democrats had pushed for an independent commission to get to the bottom of how pro-Trump supporters breached the Capitol in a deadly riot, attacked police officers and disrupted the certification of Joe Biden\u2019s November election win. After Senate Republicans blocked the commission, Pelosi moved forward with a select committee. Pelosi has sought for the select committee to be able to provide an exhaustive accounting of the events surrounding the attack, the former President\u2019s role, how extremist groups were able to organize and how security failures resulted in the deadly clash. But the California Democrat has also taken steps that have infuriated House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, including shutting down two of his picks for the select committee because of their past statements and actions that bolstered Trump\u2019s false narrative about the election being stolen. Pelosi named Cheney to the select committee, and after she rejected Reps. Jim Jordan of Ohio and Jim Banks of Indiana, McCarthy pulled the rest of the Republicans from the committee. Pelosi responded by adding Kinzinger to the panel, in an effort to give it bipartisan credibility even without McCarthy\u2019s participation. Cheney and Kinzinger have faced sharp blowback for joining Pelosi\u2019s committee, with conservatives arguing that they should be removed from their other committee slots. The two members have said those threats won\u2019t deter them. \u201cIf the conference decided or if Kevin decides they want to punish Liz Cheney and I for getting to the bottom and telling the truth, I think that probably says more about them than it does for us,\u201d Kinzinger said Monday.

            "article_content": "The House select committee investigating the January 6 attack at the Capitol held its first hearing on Tuesday with harrowing testimony from four officers who shared their stories of being attacked by the rioters. The three-hour hearing was the opening act for the committee that\u2019s preparing to investigate all of the circumstances surrounding the January 6 insurrection, including the role played by former President Donald Trump. But the first hearing was focused squarely on the violence officers faced at the hands of a mob of Trump supporters. Here are five takeaways from the committee\u2019s first hearing: One by one, the four officers who testified Tuesday \u2013 DC Metropolitan Police Officers Daniel Hodges and Michael Fanone, and Capitol Police Officer Harry Dunn and Sgt. Aquilino Gonell \u2013 recounted their gut-wrenching stories about how they were attacked and their lives were threatened on January 6. Committee members showed the body camera footage from the officers to illustrate their harrowing accounts. Both the witnesses and lawmakers became emotional at multiple points. Hughes described how he was forced to scream out in agony as he was pressed between the rioters and a metal doorframe. Fanone described how he was dragged into the crowd, beaten and electrocuted repeatedly with his Taser. \u201cI was at risk of being stripped of and killed with my own firearm as I heard chants of \u2018kill him with his own gun,\u2019\u201d Fanone said. \u201cI can still hear those words in my head today.\u201d Dunn\u2019s testimony included detailing pro-Trump supporters hurled racial epithets at him, calling him the n-word, something he said he had never experienced while wearing his police uniform. He described afterward how he sat down with another black officer \u201cand told him about the racial slurs I endured.\u201d \u201cI became very emotional and began yelling, \u2018How the blank could something like this happen? Is this America?\u2019\u201d Dunn said. Gonell, who served in Iraq, said he was more afraid working at the Capitol on January 6 than at any point in serving a war zone. \u201cI remember thinking to myself, this is how I am going to die, defending this entrance,\u201d said Gonell, who couldn\u2019t hug his wife when he returned home the following morning because he was covered in chemical spray. The gripping testimony hit home the point, over and over again, about just how violent the January 6 attack on the Capitol really was even as the insurrection has become a political fight in the months that have followed. Trump and some his GOP allies have actively tried to downplay the violence that occurred on January 6. Some congressional Republicans have suggested there was no insurrection, that the rioters weren\u2019t violent or armed, and Rep. Andrew Clyde of Georgia even compared scenes from the January 6 rioters to a \u201cnormal tourist visit.\u201d Trump, in an interview with The Washington Post reporters Philip Rucker and Carol Leonnig for their book released this month, said it was a \u201cloving crowd\u201d on January 6. Tuesday\u2019s testimony sliced through those efforts to whitewash the events of January 6. The body-cam footage was violent and hard to watch. The officers said the rioters they fought against were terrorists. Woven into the stories about how they and their colleagues were attacked \u2013 and in some cases badly injured \u2013 the officers expressed outrage that the violence launched by pro-Trump supporters was being ignored by the very lawmakers they protected that day. \u201cI feel like I went to hell and back to protect them and the people in this room. But too many are now telling me that hell doesn\u2019t exist, or that hell wasn\u2019t actually that bad,\u201d Fanone said. \u201cThe indifference shown to my colleagues is disgraceful!\u201d Fanone continued, raising his voice and slamming his fist on the table in one of the most powerful moments of the hearing. Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney, one of the two Republicans appointed by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi to the committee, asked Gonell specifically about Trump\u2019s comments that the crowd was loving. \u201cIt\u2019s upsetting. It\u2019s a pathetic excuse for his behavior for something that he himself helped to create this monstrosity,\u201d Gonell said. \u201cI\u2019m still recovering from those hugs and kisses that day, that he claimed that so many rioters, terrorists, were assaulting us that day.\u201d Outside of Cheney\u2019s questions, the select committee didn\u2019t turn much of its opening hearing on Trump\u2019s role in the January 6 insurrection, focusing on the rioters who attacked the Capitol and the officers protecting it. But it\u2019s clear that\u2019s where the committee is headed. \u201cThe rioters who tried to rob us of our democracy were propelled here by a lie,\u201d select committee Chairman Bennie Thompson said in his opening statement. \u201cAs chairman of this committee, I will not give that lie any fertile ground. We need to understand how and why the Big Lie festered.\u201d Read: Rep. Liz Cheney's opening statement before the January 6 select committee Cheney, who is facing calls for retribution from Trump and his GOP allies, said that the public deserves testimony from \u201cevery person with knowledge of the planning and preparation for January 6th.\u201d \u201cWe must also know what happened every minute of that day in the White House \u2013 every phone call, every conversation, every meeting leading up to, during, and after the attack,\u201d she said. \u201cIf those responsible are not held accountable, and if Congress does not act responsibly, this will remain a cancer on our constitutional republic, undermining the peaceful transfer of power at the heart of our democratic system.\u201d The Justice Department made it easier for former officials to testify, formally declining to assert executive privilege for the testimony of at least some witnesses related to the January 6 attack, according to a person briefed on the matter. It still remains to be seen whether Trump, his former aides or his allies in Congress will actually testify \u2013 his White House has defied congressional subpoenas before \u2013 but the select committee is already signaling it\u2019s going to try. House Democrats have held numerous high-profile hearings over the past several years aimed at the former President, from the testimony of former special counsel Robert Mueller to the impeachment proceedings over Trump\u2019s efforts to pressure Ukraine to investigate Joe Biden. This was the first time none of Trump\u2019s allies could offer up a defense of the former president. The seven Democrats and two Republicans on the select committee are all of the same mindset about the importance of getting to the bottom of what happened on January 6 and investigating Trump\u2019s role in the insurrection. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy pulled the five Republicans he\u2019d appointed to the select committee after Pelosi rejected two of his selections, and he\u2019s charged that the move shows Pelosi\u2019s select committee is politically motivated. McCarthy and the Republicans held a press conference to attack Pelosi ahead of the hearing Tuesday morning. But the two Republicans who are on the committee as Pelosi appointees sought to rebut McCarthy\u2019s claims at Tuesday\u2019s hearing. Cheney was given a de facto speaking slot after Thompson to give an opening statement about the importance of the committee to get to the truth of what happened on January 6. Rep. Adam Kinzinger, an Illinois Republican added to the panel after McCarthy withdrew his picks, choked up as he spoke to the officers testifying, explaining that he was serving on the committee \u201cnot in spite of my membership in the Republican Party but because of it.\u201d \u201cWe still don\u2019t know exactly what happened. Why? Because many in my party have treated this as just another partisan fight,\u201d Kinzinger said. \u201cIt\u2019s toxic, and it\u2019s a disservice to the officers and their families, to the staff and employees on the Capitol Complex, and to the American people who deserve the truth.\u201d The creation the select committee to investigate January 6 has been swept up in a political fight for months now over how the January 6 insurrection should be investigated. The committee\u2019s work will undoubtedly delve into the political realm as it examines the role of Trump and the reasons the pro-Trump supporters descended on the Capitol, attacked officers and tried to stop the certification of Biden\u2019s November election victory. But Tuesday\u2019s testimony underscored the lasting of impact the attack for those who experienced it up close on January 6. It\u2019s been particularly acute for Capitol Police officers, who have been hampered by low morale and shrinking ranks in the months following the attack. The officers\u2019 testifying on Tuesday became emotional at multiple points as they recounted their stories and expressed raw frustration about how lawmakers they protect at the Capitol have tried to downplay or ignore what happened. \u201cIt\u2019s indescribable. You\u2019re defending the indefensible,\u201d Gonell said of those lawmakers defending the insurrectionists. \u201cIt demoralizes not just the rank-and-file but the future recruits. What do you think people considering becoming law enforcement officers think when they see elected leaders downplaying this. Why would I risk my life for them, when they don\u2019t even care?\u201d In his testimony, Dunn acknowledged the mental toll the January 6 attack had on many officers, saying he\u2019s sought counseling and making a plea to his colleagues to be unafraid do the same. \u201cMore than six months later, January 6 still isn\u2019t over for me,\u201d Dunn said. \u201cI know so many other officers continue to hurt, both physically and emotionally. \u2026 What we went through that day was traumatic, and if you\u2019re hurting, please take advantage of the counseling services available to us.\u201d CNN\u2019s Annie Grayer, Clare Foran and Lauren Fox contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "A version of this story appeared in CNN\u2019s What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here. There\u2019s something new in the air, and it\u2019s not just the Delta variant. Now that the pandemic is isolated mostly to those who won\u2019t get the vaccine, and vaccination rates lag particularly in red states, Republican governors who raced to pander to personal freedom and enact bans on mask and vaccine requirements are pushing their citizens to get the shot as Covid rates rise and their states\u2019 hospitals fill up. After months of pushing vaccine paranoia about government overreach, Fox News is airing a PSA encouraging viewers to visit a government website and get vaccinated. A top Republican lawmaker in the House, Rep. Steve Scalise of Louisiana, after waiting months, revealed he\u2019d finally started the vaccine process this week.   There is a palpable shift in attitude toward the Covid vaccine among some conservative leaders and influencers. Now that they\u2019ve made very clear they think it\u2019s a personal choice to get vaccinated, please for the love of God get vaccinated. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, a polio survivor who has long embraced the vaccine, forcefully encouraged Kentuckians to ignore the anti-vaccine voices \u201cgiving demonstrably bad advice\u201d and get the shot \u201cas rapidly as possible, or we\u2019re going to be back in a situation in the fall that we don\u2019t yearn for, that we went through last year.\u201d And Alabama Gov. Kay Ivey, a Republican whose state has the lowest vaccination rate in the country, was upfront in saying it\u2019s \u201ctime to start blaming the unvaccinated folks\u201d for the rise in cases while pleading for residents in her state to get the vaccine, which she called \u201cthe greatest weapon we have to fight Covid.\u201d But not everyone is on board with this message. Tucker Carlson, the gadfly Fox News host who preaches fear of the government from Fox\u2019s top rated position, was still spewing against the vaccine Wednesday night. Republican lawmakers bristled when CNN asked who among them had gotten the shot. Democrats have said every one of their members in the House of Representatives is vaccinated. But nearly half of House Republicans won\u2019t publicly say what their status is. RELATED: Not all Republicans are embracing McConnell\u2019s vaccine push. Read what some had to say when asked this week \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s anybody\u2019s damn business whether I\u2019m vaccinated or not,\u201d Republican Rep. Chip Roy of Texas told CNN. \u201cThis is ridiculous, what we\u2019re doing. The American people are fully capable of making an educated decision about whether they want to get the vaccine or not.\u201d And yet with the vaccine readily available, a lot of Americans are making the decision not to get it. Less than half the total population (48.8%) is fully vaccinated. Excluding those under 12 who can\u2019t yet get the shot, 57% of the country is vaccinated and nearly 66% have started the process. RELATED: Young people intubated with Covid-19 should be \u2018a gigantic wakeup call,\u2019 Alabama doctor says Cases are up across the country, but generally speaking, states that went Republican in the 2020 election have lower vaccination rates than those that went for President Joe Biden, and they are the focus of this new summer surge. That could make Biden an ineffective messenger for the fact that the pandemic is now focused where people don\u2019t believe the government should take an active role in fighting it. \u201cWe have a pandemic for those who haven\u2019t gotten a vaccination. It\u2019s that basic, that simple. 10,000 people have recently died. 9,950 of them, thereabouts, are people who hadn\u2019t been vaccinated,\u201d Biden said during CNN\u2019s presidential town hall on Wednesday night in Cincinnati, Ohio. 'I was disappointed': Dr. Wen reacts to Biden's answer on Covid-19 vaccine While the new talking point from Biden is that the pandemic is now focused squarely on the unvaccinated, it\u2019s false to think that\u2019s just White conservatives watching Fox News. In fact, racial minorities have felt the brunt of Covid around the country, according to a Kaiser Family Foundation analysis: For example, in California, 30% of vaccinations have gone to Hispanic people, while they account for 63% of cases, 48% of deaths, and 40% of the total population in the state. Similarly, in the District of Columbia, Black people have received 43% of vaccinations, while they make up 56% of cases, 71% of deaths, and 46% of the total population. The size of these differences varies across states. The number of states where the shares of vaccinations received by Black and Hispanic people are more proportionate to their shares of the total population and/or their shares of cases or deaths in the state has grown over time. Politics certainly is a factor, though, in who is and is not getting vaccinated. In a Kaiser survey from June, 86% of Democrats reported getting at least one dose and were the most-vaccinated subgroup. Just 52% of Republicans reported getting at least one dose and were among the least-vaccinated subgroups. Republicans were also, along with rural residents and White Evangelical Christians, the most likely to say they would definitely not get the shot. RELATED: Covid-19 vaccine myths: These reasons for not getting a shot don\u2019t hold up. In fact, they\u2019ll set the US back When CBS/YouGov asked in June why people weren\u2019t getting the shot, allowing more than one answer, mistrust of the government and disbelief in the vaccine featured throughout the results. Forty percent said they don\u2019t trust the government, a third said they don\u2019t trust scientists, more than a quarter said they aren\u2019t that worried about Covid-19 and a quarter said they don\u2019t generally get any kind of vaccine. Half said they thought the vaccine was \u201cstill too untested,\u201d with slightly less than that saying they were worried about allergies or side effects. This is where skepticism in conservative outlets and social media could play an additional role, feeding doubts that exist already. It is not just White, rural and Evangelical people who are skeptical of the vaccine, according to Kaiser. Black adults were less likely to say they would definitely not get vaccinated (9%), but at 60% reporting having gotten the shot, they were also less likely than White adults or Hispanic adults to have gotten it. Doctor: Patients 'beg me for the vaccine' before being intubated Those ratios could be changing. Black people make up about 12% of the US population, but were 14% of the people who initiated vaccination in the last two weeks, according to Kaiser\u2019s more recent analysis of CDC data. There\u2019s even more growth among Hispanics, who represent 17% of the US population and were 30% those who recently initiated the vaccination process. Each state has its own data on current cases, hospitalizations and deaths. And they all tell the same story. Of nearly 9,000 Texas Covid deaths since February, all but 43 were among the unvaccinated. Just about 43% of Texans have been fully vaccinated, however, and the Republican governor, Greg Abbott, said this week it would be inappropriate to ask them to mask up again. RELATED: What if the government got it wrong on masks again? He made the comments explaining why Texas schools would not be allowed to require masks. Schoolkids under 12 are obviously among the 57% of Texans who aren\u2019t vaccinated. Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis, a Republican, actively encourages Floridians to get vaccinated and bragged this week about how his state prioritized senior citizens soon after vaccines were approved. But he\u2019s selling \u201cDon\u2019t Fauci my Florida\u201d shirts on his campaign website, a derisive allusion to Dr. Anthony Fauci, the nation\u2019s top infectious disease expert. RELATED: As Florida cases surge, DeSantis stays the course on Covid DeSantis has also vowed to continue his fight with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and cruise liners that want to require proof of vaccination from passengers itching to get into confined spaces for pleasure cruises. He\u2019ll go all the way to the Supreme Court, he said this week, just as Florida leapt to the top of the list of states with new Covid cases and hospitalizations. He\u2019s also ruled out the possibility of another statewide lockdown and argued local jurisdictions that want to reimpose mask requirements are sending the wrong message, no matter how many new cases there are in his state. \u201cI get a little bit frustrated when I see some of these jurisdictions saying, even if you\u2019re healthy and vaccinated you must wear a mask because we\u2019re seeing increased cases,\u201d DeSantis said Wednesday during a press conference in St. Petersburg. \u201cUnderstand what that message is sending to people who aren\u2019t vaccinated. It\u2019s telling them that the vaccines don\u2019t work.\u201d As if his fight with the CDC over vaccine requirements isn\u2019t doing something similar. But the CDC will have to deal with the logic underlying DeSantis\u2019 opposition to new mask requirements since their push to undo mask requirements as an enticement to get more people vaccinated appears to be wearing off. Former Surgeon General Dr. Jerome Adams wrote in the Washington Post the CDC should reconsider its larger mask guidance immediately and get more people to cover their faces indoors. The government was wrong when it argued against masking early in the pandemic, he argued, and it was wrong to use unmasking as a carrot to get people vaccinated. RELATED: Biden health officials begin discussing mask recommendations as variants surge cases \u201cAfter realizing you\u2019ve erred, the best way forward is to own the situation and hit the reset button. That\u2019s what I did \u2014 and that\u2019s what the CDC needs to do, too,\u201d he said. Biden said at the CNN town hall in Ohio he expects the CDC may recommend masks for unvaccinated students (that means everyone under 12) in the fall. That could lead to another standoff between the federal government and Florida. DeSantis is among the growing list of states to already ban mask requirements for students. RELATED: Pediatricians\u2019 group says all kids should wear masks in school, but some states block such mandates Florida has the most new Covid cases, but Arkansas has the most as a percentage of its population. The Republican governor there, Asa Hutchinson, also signed a bill that bans schools from requiring vaccines. That doesn\u2019t mean he opposes vaccines. He went on a three-day tour of the state to meet vaccinate hostility first hand. Other GOP governors have desperately called on the US Food and Drug Administration to give full approval to the vaccine, a valid argument since just about half the country has gotten it. That final signoff would be another nudge in favor of the vaccine\u2019s safety and clear a roadblock to efforts at requiring it. Biden suggested the approval could come as soon as this fall, although the FDA has yet to set a timeline. For now, the vaccine remains for emergency use even though so much of the country has bought in and leaders are finding it so hard to get the rest of Americans to do the same.

            "article_content": "While the Texas Legislature remains embroiled in a battle over election laws, Republican senators have advanced a bill that would reshape how social studies teachers can discuss race and current events in their classrooms. SB3, which passed the Republican-led chamber in a 18-4 vote last week, now remains stalled in the state House after that chamber\u2019s Democrats broke quorum and went to Washington, DC, to block action on a separate restrictive voting law. Republican Gov. Greg Abbott listed a proposal \u201cconcerning critical race theory\u201d among his priorities for the legislature\u2019s special session that convened earlier this month. With SB3, Republican lawmakers are essentially seeking to replace the entire House bill, which Abbott just signed into law in June and is set to go into effect in September. HB3979 calls on the Texas Board of Education to \u201cadopt essential knowledge and skills that develop each student\u2019s civic knowledge\u201d by using historical primary documents to promote the understanding of a variety of topics, including subjects like: \u201cthe fundamental moral, political, and intellectual foundations of the American experiment in self-government,\u201d the civil rights movement, the history of Native Americans and women\u2019s suffrage. However, the bill states that teachers can\u2019t \u201crequire\u201d or include in their courses, the concept that \u201cone race or sex is inherently superior to another race or sex\u201d or the concept that \u201can individual, by virtue of the individual\u2019s race or sex, is inherently racist, sexist or oppressive, whether consciously or unconsciously.\u201d It also notes that \u201ca teacher may not be compelled to discuss a particular current event or widely debated and currently controversial issue of public policy or social affairs.\u201d Teachers, according to the bill, also can\u2019t require or give extra credit for a student\u2019s political activism. The new legislation proposed by Senate Republicans strikes entire sections of the House bill. It removes references to the teaching of a series of historical primary documents written by George Washington, Thomas Jefferson, Frederick Douglass, Susan B. Anthony, Cesar Chavez and Martin Luther King Jr., among others. Discussion of the \u201ccivic accomplishments of marginalized populations\u201d have also been struck from the bill, including teaching on the history of White supremacy, the institution of slavery and \u201cthe Ku Klux Klan, and the ways it is morally wrong.\u201d The history of Native Americans is also completely omitted from the Senate bill. Opponents of SB3 have argued that limiting teachings around race obscures the truth and attempts to rewrite history. \u201cIncredibly, Senate Bill 3 specifies that a teacher may not discuss current events or controversial issues of public policy or social affairs unless the educator \u2018strives to explore the topic from diverse and contending perspectives without giving deference to any one perspective,\u2019\u201d Democratic state Sen. Judith Zaffirini said during Senate debate on the bill. \u201cHow could a teacher possibly discuss slavery, the Holocaust, or the mass shootings at the Walmart in El Paso or at the Sutherland Springs church in my district \u2018without giving deference to any one perspective?\u2019\u201d Neither bill specifically mentions critical race theory \u2013 a concept that has been around for decades and seeks to understand and address inequality and racism in the US by recognizing that systemic racism is part of American society. But HB3979 and SB3 state that teachers can\u2019t make the concept that slavery was a founding principle of the United States required course curriculum. Opponents of critical race theory and similar teaching requirements have slammed it as poisoning discussions on racism. Former President Donald Trump opposed the teaching of the New York Times\u2019 1619 Project \u2013 the Pulitzer Prize-winning project that reframes American history around the date of August 1619, when the first slave ship arrived on America\u2019s shores \u2013 in schools and his administration banned federal agencies from conducting racial sensitivity training related to critical race theory, calling it \u201cdivisive, anti-American propaganda.\u201d State Rep. Steve Toth, a Republican sponsor of the House legislation, said at the time of HB3979\u2019s passing that \u201cat a time when racial tensions are at a boiling point, we don\u2019t need to burden our kids with guilt for racial crimes they had nothing to do with. Our students are stressed enough already and don\u2019t need one more reason to feel inadequate.\u201d The fate of the Senate bill remains in limbo as it\u2019s unclear when the House could again reach quorum to consider the legislation. The Texas debate is just the latest in state legislatures over critical race theory in the education system. At least two dozen states have banned critical race theory or introduced legislation to ban it from being taught in the classroom.",

At the beginning of the month, the 6-3 conservative-majority US Supreme Court essentially gave Republicans carte blanche to racially discriminate against voters. Through its ruling in Brnovich v. Democratic National Committee, the Court mangled the landmark 1965 Voting Rights Act, whose protections had already been eroded in 2013. The case was a sobering reminder that, while some Democrats like to respond to Republicans\u2019 maneuvering to block access to the polls by saying that voters just need to, well, vote, the problem isn\u2019t that constituents aren\u2019t turning out. After all, in the 2020 presidential election, Joe Biden won a record 81 million votes, even as the US was in the thick of the coronavirus pandemic. The issue is that, all across the country, Republicans continue to enact legislation that restricts voting for those Americans \u2013 largely people of color \u2013 they don\u2019t believe deserve political representation. See, for instance, Georgia, which is facing a lawsuit from the Department of Justice over state voter suppression laws that activists and Democratic lawmakers say target Black Americans. \u201cJust saying \u2018I will vote\u2019 was not enough following slavery & Reconstruction; nor is it an adequate response to current historic systemic attacks on voting rights,\u201d Black Voters Matter co-founder Cliff Albright wrote in a recent tweet. Put a little differently, Republicans have made clear their eagerness to abuse and twist voting rights to their advantage \u2013 and without legislative action and meaningful court reform to defend the sanctity of the ballot box, the party will eventually insulate itself from voters. Here are a few major voting rights stories that underscore the stakes of this history-making political moment: What\u2019s happening: Earlier this month, Texas Democrats suddenly left the Lone Star State for Washington, in an extraordinary attempt to deny their Republican counterparts the quorum necessary to pass anti-voting rights legislation. It can be easy, in some ways, to view the Texas state lawmakers\u2019 move purely as political performance: Democrats, too, like to disturb the normal order of things. But that manner of thinking doesn\u2019t appear to grasp why, exactly, Texas Democrats are so desperate; one has even launched a campaign for higher office since arriving in Washington, in the hope of ousting the Republican currently holding the seat. Why you should care: Already, Texas is the most difficult state to vote in, according to a 2020 analysis from Northern Illinois University. Together, the two voting bills of concern \u2013 SB 1 and HB 3 \u2013 would increase that difficulty by imposing mail-in ballot restrictions, banning drive-thru voting and empowering partisan poll watchers (who, notably, have a fraught racial history), among other things that would disproportionately disadvantage people of color and other Democratic-leaning groups. \u201cThe secretary of state\u2019s office in Texas told us that our elections ran smoothly, securely, and were a success,\u201d Texas Democratic state Rep. John Bucy III told CNN\u2019s Erin Burnett. \u201cSo, you have to question what is the problem these bills are trying to solve? Clearly, all they are trying to do is make it harder for the people of Texas to vote, specifically individuals with disabilities, women and people of color.\u201d Indeed, what\u2019s disturbing about these political machinations is that they\u2019re designed to entrench Republicans\u2019 power. Or as the journalist Adam Serwer recently put it to me, \u201cPublic feedback is necessary for democracy to function. If politicians can get elected without regard for what the public thinks of them, then they have no reason to hew to the public\u2019s preferences or respect their rights.\u201d What\u2019s happening: Meanwhile, in South Dakota, Native Americans are suing the state. The reason is that the state, they say, has repeatedly violated the National Voter Registration Act, aka the Motor Voter Act, a federal law that requires state governments to help people register to vote when they\u2019re seeking services through the Department of Motor Vehicles or other offices that provide public assistance. Why you should care: In violating the act, South Dakota has made it disproportionately harder for Native Americans to cast their ballots. Earlier this month, the Lakota People\u2019s Law Project, Kimberly Dillon of the Rosebud Sioux Tribe and Hoksila White Mountain of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe joined the Oglala Sioux and Rosebud Sioux tribes in a lawsuit that began last September. The plaintiffs have minced no words in pointing out how their voting experiences in deep-red South Dakota echo a Republican-fueled trend across the country \u2013 including in states such as Arizona and Montana \u2013 toward shrinking the power of Democratic-leaning groups. \u201cWe see routine violations of federal law,\u201d Chase Iron Eyes, lead counsel for the Lakota People\u2019s Law Project, said. \u201cIn 2018 and 2020, we worked hard with tribal governments and members to ensure that the voices of Native people were heard at the ballot box. Unfortunately, in many cases, systemic discrimination prevented that. That\u2019s why we\u2019re joining this suit. We\u2019re battling a long history of racism and current nationwide efforts to install new Jim Crow-style laws,\u201d he added. What\u2019s happening: Republicans aren\u2019t inflicting all this damage on voting rights on their own. The US Supreme Court\u2019s conservatives are helping. \u201cTragic\u201d: That\u2019s how Justice Elena Kagan described the Court\u2019s July ruling in Brnovich v. Democratic National Committee that clobbered what remained of the Voting Rights Act following 2013\u2019s Shelby County v. Holder. \u201cThe Court decides this Voting Rights Act case at a perilous moment for the nation\u2019s commitment to equal citizenship,\u201d Kagan wrote in a withering dissent. \u201cIt decides this case in an era of voting-rights retrenchment \u2013 when too many states and localities are restricting access to voting in ways that will predictably deprive members of minority groups of equal access to the ballot box.\u201d Native American activists have expressed this precise concern. \u201cThe Supreme Court had an opportunity to protect our right to vote at a critical moment in our history, but instead decided to let discriminatory voting policies in Arizona stand, making it harder for Indigenous, Black and brown communities to vote,\u201d Northeast Arizona Native Democrats said. Why you should care: While at issue in Brnovich were two Republican-backed restrictive voting laws in Arizona \u2013 where the Navajo Nation played a crucial role in helping Biden put the reliably red state in the Democratic column for only the second time in 68 years \u2013 the Court\u2019s decision will certainly embolden Republicans far and wide. In addition, Brnovich confirmed that the Court\u2019s conservative justices never cared about safeguarding voting rights for everyone. Sure, they didn\u2019t come to Donald Trump\u2019s aid during the 2020 contest, when the blustering former President lied about widespread voter fraud in cities with significant Black populations. But as the attorney Jay Willis wrote in December, \u201cThe greatest trick the conservative legal movement can hope to pull off is convincing people that it was never really a threat.\u201d Kagan\u2019s conservative colleagues are playing the long game. And it ought to be obvious which constituents they\u2019re setting up to be the biggest losers.",

            "article_content": "The House select committee investigating the Capitol riot will hold its first hearing on July 27 to hear directly from Capitol and DC police officers who responded to the deadly attack, Democratic leaders announced Wednesday. The hearing will mark the first time the panel will hear public testimony from first responders and will kick start its efforts to investigate the events on January 6. Chairman of the committee Bennie Thompson said last week he planned to have the committee hold its first hearing as soon as this month, regardless of whether House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy appointed anyone to the panel. While the committee did not provide a witness list, sources tell CNN that staffers reached out to at least two police officers and asked them to testify: United States Capitol Police Officer Harry Dunn, who fought off the pro-Trump mob as they hurled racial slurs at him, and DC Metropolitan Police Officer Michael Fanone, who was beaten, tased and suffered a heart attack while responding to the attack. Both officers, who indicated they\u2019d be willing to appear before the committee, had been vocal about the need for an independent commission to investigate the deadly insurrection and lobbied members of Congress to support legislation to establish one. With the panel\u2019s first public hearing, Democrats are hoping to shine a bright light on the deadly events of January 6 in the face of a GOP-led effort to whitewash the insurrection and who was behind it. Rep. Andrew Clyde, a Republican from Georgia who was on the House floor as rioters tried to breach the chamber, has since said the day looked like \u201ca normal tourist visit.\u201d And other Republicans have floated a wild conspiracy theory that the FBI orchestrated the violent mob attack. McCarthy has yet to name his five GOP members to the panel, telling Fox News earlier this week that he hasn\u2019t decided who \u2013 or even whether \u2014 to appoint anyone. But he is expected to pick members to the select committee before the first hearing, according to a source familiar with the thinking. Wednesday\u2019s announcement effectively set the stop clock for McCarthy, and the source said there is a recognition that it will be important to have GOP members in place for that first hearing. Meanwhile, Democratic sources previously told CNN their strategy is to avoid turning the committee\u2019s efforts into a spectacle and keep most work for the committee behind closed doors. Speaker Nancy Pelosi appointed eight members to the select committee, including one Republican, Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming. In her first interview since being tapped for the investigation, Cheney warned McCarthy against naming Republicans who are still challenging the legitimacy of the 2020 election results or downplaying January 6. \u201cIt\u2019s very important that we have members who are committed to upholding the rule of law and members who are committed to their oaths to the Constitution,\u201d Cheney said to CNN. \u201cAnd I would certainly hope that the minority leader will be guided by that as he makes his choices.\u201d This story has been updated with additional developments Wednesday. CNN\u2019s Jeremy Herb and Ryan Nobles have contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Donald Trump\u2019s final days as president were defined by near-total chaos as House Democrats moved to impeach him for his action (and inaction) during the January 6 riot at the US Capitol even as the soon-to-be-former president sought to use the power of his office to settle scores and reward loyalists. And yet, even amid those last, wild days, there was a sense that for as bad as everything we could see was, there was even worse stuff going on behind closed doors that wouldn\u2019t be made public until Trump left office, and the true reportorial digging began. Which brings me to Tuesday, when two highly anticipated Trump books \u2013 Michael Bender\u2019s \u201cFrankly We Did Win This Election,\u201d and Michael Wolff\u2019s \u201cLandslide\u201d \u2013 went on sale, with a third book \u2013 \u201cI Alone Can Fix It\u201d by Carol Leonnig and Philip Rucker \u2013 scheduled to be released in seven days\u2019 time. All three books focus on Trump\u2019s last year in office. And all three present what can only be described as a terrifying picture of a president consumed by personal hatred and unwilling to even consider the limits his predecessors had placed on themselves in office. THE POINT -- NOW ON YOUTUBE! \nIn each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe! The stories that have already emerged paint a scary picture. Trump calling for the execution of whoever leaked that he had been taken to the White House bunker while Black Lives Matter protesters were marching through the streets of Washington in the wake of the murder of George Floyd in May 2020. His volcanic reaction when Arizona was called for Joe Biden on election night. Trump raging at then-Attorney General Bill Barr about (nonexistent) voter fraud. A shouting match between Trump and chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Mark Milley over the appropriate response to the BLM protests engulfing the country in the summer of 2020. There are more stories that have emerged from these books. And there will be even more once readers \u2013 and reporters \u2013 get their hands on the hard copies and are able to do their own digging into Trump\u2019s final days. But these stories also present a problem: Each one is, yes, appalling. But the nature of our news cycle is such that even as I was writing this piece, I was struggling to remember the individual stories that had already come out of the books. The stories that come out of these books \u2013 released to gin up excitement and, more importantly, sales in advance of their releases \u2013 tend to be fleeting, shining bright for a brief moment when the political universe is all staring at them but quickly disappearing into the vastness of our broader news consumption. That fact is why it\u2019s important not to get too caught up in any one revelation that has or will emerge from these books and instead take a step back and see the broader reality being painted here. And that reality is this: * Faced with a once-in-a-century public health crisis, Donald Trump not only drastically mishandled some of the basics (rapid testing for Covid-19, mask-wearing) but also actively worked to undermine public confidence in the very doctors, epidemiologists and public health experts who were working to keep Americans safe. * Unable to accept that he had lost the election, Trump sought to use the official powers of the government \u2013 including the Justice Department \u2013 to try to find non-existent evidence of fraud. He created an environment in which a large chunk of Americans believed this Big Lie about the election and then not only incited the January 6 crowd but also stood by for hours as they ransacked the Capitol. * Trump, who repeatedly told crowds during the campaign that he had done more for Black people than any president since Abraham Lincoln, failed to grasp either the gravity or the goals of the Black Lives Matter protests. He saw the racial justice protests as nothing more than an uprising against HIM \u2013 and tried to force the military to deploy to states where the marches were most prevalent. This is, in sum, a man deeply unfit for the presidency. (That is not a partisan statement. It is a statement of fact based on the clear portrait we have of how Trump behaved while in the most powerful office in the country.) A man who, by his inability to understand the sanctity of the office he held, threatened to destroy that sanctity for those who would follow him into the White House. And a man who was, without any question, an active danger for every single American \u2013 whether they supported or opposed him. THAT needs to be the takeaway from these books. THAT is the forest through the trees. And THAT is the truth that voters needs to hear if and when Trump tries to reclaim the presidency in 2024.",

            "article_content": "They\u2019re trying to save democracy by walking out on it. Texas state lawmakers, enacting an intricately plotted escape, left their posts and the Lone Star state itself and took flight to Washington on Monday on an extraordinary mission to halt Republican restrictive voting bills built on former President Donald Trump\u2019s fraud lies. After stepping off two chartered jets, they insisted they planned to stay until a highly unlikely scenario unfolds in which moderate Democratic senators kill filibuster rules used by the GOP to block voting rights reform. \u201cWe are coming to DC to put pressure on them to act, because this isn\u2019t just Texas,\u201d Texas Democratic state Rep. John Bucy III told CNN\u2019s Erin Burnett on Monday. \u201cAll over the South and in Republican states, we are seeing voter suppression bills. We need Congress to pass the For the People Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Act,\u201d said Bucy, who unlike his colleagues set off the long drive from Texas to the US capital. The spectacle is the latest stunning example of how the US political system is on the edge of meltdown as a result of turmoil triggered by Trump\u2019s false claims of a stolen election, which are now taken as fact by millions of Republican voters. The move also represents the growing desperation of Democrats who believe that their chances of winning future elections, including in 2022 and 2024, are being undermined by orchestrated assaults on the voting system by the GOP. In effect, the fleeing Texas House Democrats are denying Republican Texas Gov. Greg Abbott a quorum in a special session he called partly to pass a new measure that critics say severely curtails access to voting, especially for Democratic and Black voters. The dramatic gambit is the ultimate act of civil disobedience by the Texas lawmakers. It is intended to provide a stark contrast with federal Democrats \u2013 like West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin \u2013 who are unwilling to break their own conventions to overturn the Senate filibuster. The lawmakers hope that they can hold off the passage of the Texas law to give them time to somehow convince senators to pass new federal measures that would supersede their state\u2019s legislation, which is likely to eventually pass. Chris Turner, chairman of the Texas House Democratic Caucus, told CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper after landing at Dulles International Airport outside Washington that he had a clear message for the US Senate. \u201cYou have to act, and you have to act now. There\u2019s no more waiting,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need Congress to pass federal voting rights legislation to save our democracy because these Republican attacks will continue to occur, over and over again, in Texas and across the country.\u201d But the action of the Texas Democrats raises its own uncomfortable questions about the health of American democracy \u2013 as did walkouts by state Republican lawmakers in Oregon in recent years, for example, to block the passage of progressive legislation by Democratic majorities. While the sincerity of Texas Republicans appears tainted by political opportunism, their majorities in the state legislature and Abbott\u2019s position in the governor\u2019s mansion were themselves the product of fair and democratic elections. In this case it is Democrats, rather than Republicans, disrupting regular order and challenging the principle that power follows certified elections in which the will of voters are expressed. The walkout \u2013 which could force the lawmakers to stay out their home state until the end of the special session, well into August \u2013 also comes as President Joe Biden travels to the incubator of US democracy in Philadelphia Tuesday. He will give a major speech devoted to what the White House says is the \u201csacred, constitutional right to vote.\u201d Biden however so far is not in favor of abolishing the Senate filibuster in order to pass voting rights legislation, despite warning parts of the US are falling back into the days of Jim Crow laws that established barriers Black Americans had to surmount before voting. Given Abbott\u2019s capacity to call any number of special sessions and to take other steps to potentially compel attendance from lawmakers, their exodus may be hard to sustain in the long-term. Democrats are accusing Abbott of rushing through voting measures \u2013 and a raft of other controversial legislation, including a ban on the teaching of critical race theory in schools \u2013 to boost his own reelection race next year among Republican voters and potentially a presidential run in 2024. Their protests \u2013 along with the GOP\u2019s success in thwarting broad voting rights legislation in the Senate and a recent Supreme Court decision further neutering the Voting Rights Act \u2013 might add up to Democratic futility. Such an outcome could mean that the only chance that Democrats in Texas and elsewhere will have in countering Republican restrictive voting laws will be in using them to supercharge turnout in the midterms and the next presidential election. That will be a tall task since the Brennan Center for Justice, a law and policy institute, says there are now 28 new restrictive voting laws in 17 states. The Texas lawmakers say they had no choice but to take desperate measures after walking out of a regular session of the legislature in June to prevent the passage of Senate Bill 7, which would have made mail-in voting more difficult, banned drive-thru voting introduced in the pandemic and prevented 24-hour voting allowed by Houston, one of the state\u2019s most populous Democratic strongholds that is key to that party\u2019s hopes of turning Texas blue. \u201cThis bill will make it harder for the people of Texas to vote. The secretary of state\u2019s office in Texas told us that our elections ran smoothly, securely, and were a success,\u201d Bucy said as he drove from Texas to Washington. \u201cSo, you have to question what is the problem these bills are trying to solve? Clearly, all they are trying to do is make it harder for the people of Texas to vote, specifically individuals with disabilities, women and people of color.\u201d The previous Democratic boycott did appear to work in removing several of the most contentious measures from the legislation. It does not contain new restrictions on the Sunday voting that is popular with Democratic Party activists for maximizing turnout from Black churchgoers. But it does make it harder to cast ballots by limiting the collection of ballots by third parties, introduces new restrictions for voting by mail and takes further steps to water down the non-partisan nature of the counting and certification of ballots. Abbott reacted to the departure of the Texas Democrats by accusing them of failing to show up to work on behalf of their constituents. \u201cAs they fly across the country on cushy private planes, they leave undone issues that can help their districts and our state,\u201d the governor said. So far, Abbott has not mentioned potential sanctions, including the use of law enforcement officers or the possible use of fines against the lawmakers to compel attendance. Texas Republican House leader Dade Phelan vowed to use \u201cevery available resource under the Texas Constitution\u201d to establish a quorum \u2013 the minimum number of members legally required to hold a valid legislative session. And Texas US Sen. John Cornyn mocked the Democrats, saying their behavior insulted the self-image of hard-driving Texans. \u201cIt\u2019s not very Texan. \u201cYou stay and you fight \u2013 you don\u2019t run away,\u201d he told CNN\u2019s Manu Raju. Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, meanwhile, hit the angle that the \u201cimmature\u201d behavior by the Democrats was in itself an affront to the political process. \u201cIt is a disgrace to democracy,\u201d Paxton said in a statement. A source familiar with the group\u2019s plans said they hoped to set up meetings with Democratic senators in Washington. But they have already had a strong endorsement from Vice President Kamala Harris, who mentioned their \u201cextraordinary courage and commitment,\u201d during a voting rights event in Michigan on Monday. \u201cThey are leaders who are marching in the path that so many others before did when they fought \u2013 and many died \u2013 for our right to vote,\u201d said Harris who has been tasked by Biden with leading the administration\u2019s voting rights battle. \u201cI do believe that fighting for the right to vote is as American as apple pie.\u201d Texas Republicans have argued that Democrats should not have advantages \u2013 such as increased voting hours \u2013 that are not available to conservative voters in sparsely populated rural areas. That principle effectively makes it harder to vote in high density cities long known for long lines on Election Day than in regions where polling places are less crowded. There is no evidence of widespread fraud in Texas or anywhere else in last November\u2019s election. Multiple efforts by Trump to prove there was have been thrown out of court \u2013 often by judges appointed by GOP presidents.",

            "article_content": "New county-level findings on Americans\u2019 religious affiliations show the two parties glaring across a deep chasm in America\u2019s changing spiritual landscape. The religious fault line between the two sides is only deepening, adding another explosive dimension to the volatile separation between red and blue America. Whites who identify as Christians composed a vastly larger share of the population in the counties Donald Trump won last fall than those captured by President Joe Biden, according to previously unpublished data provided to CNN by the nonpartisan Public Religion Research Institute from a pathbreaking new study estimating religious affiliation at the county level. What we\u2019re seeing unfolding over the last four years, and coming into full flower now, the divides really are about American identity, much more than they are about a policy or even economics. Today we should probably replace \u2018It\u2019s the economy, stupid\u2019 with \u2018It\u2019s American identity, stupid.\u2019 Robert P. Jones, founder and CEO, Public Religion Research Institute While White Christians have fallen below a majority of the US population over the past decade, they still made up almost exactly two-thirds of the adults in the counties Trump carried \u2013 and an even higher percentage in the counties that provided him his largest margins, according to the new findings. By contrast, White Christians represent only about two-fifths of the population in the counties that voted for Biden \u2013 and an even smaller percentage in the counties that gave him his biggest margins. These new county-level findings fill in the picture that exit polls and other surveys have painted over recent years. On one side they show a GOP coalition still dominated by the White Christians who constituted a majority of the nation itself for most of our history; on the other is a Democratic coalition that has been fundamentally reshaped by America\u2019s growing religious and racial diversity and is now split almost in thirds among White Christians, non-White Christians, and those who adhere to non-Christian faiths or no faith at all, according to the latest PRRI findings. Those latter two groups represent an absolute majority of the population in the counties Biden carried, PRRI found. The grounding of today\u2019s partisan differences in such elemental components of social identity as religion \u2013 as well as race, education and age \u2013 helps explain why the balance of power has grown so difficult for either party to fundamentally shift, despite all the tumultuous events of recent years. It also explains why so many Americans consider the stakes in the political competition higher than ever. The PRRI results point toward a political competition that now revolves less around individual policy disputes than the larger question of whether America\u2019s direction will be set by the predominantly White and Christian voters who have historically wielded the most power or by an emerging America defined by both religious and racial diversity. \u201cWhat we\u2019re seeing unfolding over the last four years, and coming into full flower now, the [political] divides really are about American identity, much more than they are about a policy or even economics,\u201d says Robert P. Jones, founder and CEO of PRRI. \u201cToday we should probably replace \u2018It\u2019s the economy, stupid\u2019 with \u2018It\u2019s American identity, stupid.\u2019 \u201c Jones, like other analysts, believes a pervasive sense of loss and displacement in a diversifying country has solidified the strong affinity for Trump-style politics among many White Christians, especially White evangelical Protestants. \u201cIt really is hard to overstate how central to White Christians\u2019 worldview is this idea of America as a White Christian nation,\u201d says Jones, author of the book \u201cWhite Too Long,\u201d a history of the relationship between Christian churches and racial inequality. A poll of Trump supporters earlier this year by the conservative Ethics and Public Policy Center underscores his point: Fully 87% of them agreed that \u201cChristian faith is an essential part of American greatness.\u201d That number rose to a near unanimous 97% among White evangelical Trump supporters. QAnon is spreading amongst evangelicals. These pastors are trying to stop it Both the Ethics and Public Policy Center polling and the Public Religion Research Institute\u2019s annual \u201cAmerican Values Survey\u201d document deep concern among Trump\u2019s White Christian supporters, especially evangelicals, that social change of all sorts is eroding Christianity\u2019s central position in American life. In the EPPC poll, 89% of all Trump supporters (and 94% of his evangelical backers) said that \u201cChristianity is under attack in America today.\u201d In the latest PRRI polling, three-fourths of White evangelicals agreed that immigrants are \u201cinvading\u201d America and replacing its culture; just over 7 in 10 agreed that Whites now face as much discrimination as Blacks and that the values of Islam are incompatible with American values. Nearly 6 in 10 of them, in a recoil from changing gender roles, said that \u201csociety is becoming too soft and feminine.\u201d This sense of siege, Jones said, has left many conservative Christian voters open to both Trump\u2019s message of resisting social change and to wild conspiracy theories, such as his disproven claims about massive election fraud in 2020. In recent PRRI polling, roughly one-fourth of White evangelical Protestants expressed sympathy for the QAnon conspiracy theory and as many agreed that \u201ctrue American patriots may have to resort to violence\u201d to save the US. \u201cI think as this central tentpole that has been holding up their worldview \u2013 America as a White Christian nation, their own private promised land \u2013 has fallen, just under the sheer weight of the changing country all around them, it has left them vulnerable to grasping at straws and believing in delusions,\u201d Jones says. Behind this weakness for ungrounded political fantasy is an implacable demographic reality: White Christians have been relentlessly declining as a share of America\u2019s population. Whites who identify as Christians composed a majority of Americans through almost all of US history. Even as late as 1968, when President Richard Nixon was first elected, Gallup polling found that 85% of Americans identified as White and Christian. (At that point about 60% of Americans identified as White Protestants and another roughly 25% as White Catholics.) That number has plummeted over the past half century as the nation has grown more diverse racially (reducing the White share of the population) and religiously (reducing the share of Christians). Different surveys plot the change at slightly varying speeds, but they all show the same trajectory, with the nation reaching a dramatic milestone sometime over the past decade. According to the annual General Social Survey by NORC at the University of Chicago, an independent research organization, White Christians fell below majority status in the country for the first time sometime between 2010 and 2012. Gallup, in figures it provided me, put the tipping point to minority status somewhere between 2016 and 2017. Though the Pew Research Center and PRRI did not conduct polls frequently enough to identify a precise tipping point, in surveys over the past decade both also found White Christians falling to well below half of the population. Opinion: America is no longer as evangelical as it was -- and here's why In the PRRI studies, White Christians reached a low point of 42% of the population in 2018. PRRI says the group has rebounded slightly since, to 44% of the population in the latest Census of American Religion, which it released last week. Gallup, though it places the share of White Christians slightly higher, hasn\u2019t found a rebound: It shows their level stable at 47% since 2018. (Neither the General Social Survey nor Pew has numbers more recent than that.) The growth in PRRI\u2019s data came primarily from an unexpected source: a slight increase in the share of Americans who identify as mainline Protestants, a faith that had seemed the most endangered over recent decades. White Catholics have also stabilized in the PRRI data, but the institute found the share of adults who identify as White evangelical Protestants, the bedrock group in the Republican coalition, continuing to slide; in PRRI\u2019s data, evangelicals now comprise 14.5% of Americans, down from about 21% a decade ago. Jones says that while there is no conclusive proof in the data, there\u2019s evidence to suggest that some White Protestants who once might have identified as evangelical have migrated toward more mainline Protestant denominations over unease with evangelical leaders\u2019 unconditional identification with Trump. Notwithstanding their slight differences, all the major data sources agree on the broad trend of growing religious pluralism. The shrinking share of White Christians have been replaced partly by non-White Christians, who have grown from just under one-fourth of the population earlier in this century to slightly over one-fourth now. Even more important has been the rising number of Americans who don\u2019t identify with any religious faith: They\u2019ve increased from about 1 in 6 adults earlier in this century to nearly 1 in 4 now. These powerful currents have washed over both parties, but they have carried Republicans and Democrats to very different places. White Christians still make up 68% of adults who identify as Republicans, PRRI found, with White evangelical Christians (at 29%), the largest religious group in the party (if down from their numbers even in the GOP earlier this century). By contrast, White Christians now compose just 39% of those who identify as Democrats. Non-White Christians contribute about 1 in 3 Democrats, PRRI found, compared with only about 1 in 7 Republicans. The remaining Democrats (nearly 3 in 10) ascribe either to non-Christian faiths or no religion at all; those two groups represent roughly one-sixth of the GOP, only a little over half as much. In all, the two parties now present religious profiles that amount to snapshots through time. Today\u2019s Republican coalition looks something like the religious profile in America overall about 25 years ago (the last time White Christians represented two-thirds of all Americans in the General Social Survey studies was around 1995); the Democratic coalition\u2019s religious breakdown approximates what America itself might look like 10 or so years from now. Jones makes the same point from a slightly different vantage point: He notes that the religious composition of the Republican coalition now closely resembles the profile of Americans 65 and older, while the Democratic composition closely overlaps with the overall profile of adults younger than 30. The new county-level data from PRRI shows just how powerfully and pervasively these contrasts now shape the competition between the parties. In its latest report, PRRI made an unprecedented attempt to document American religious affiliation by county, drawing on 459,822 survey interviews with Americans across all 50 states that it conducted from 2013 to 2019. That report found sharp regional differences in religious affiliation, with all White Christians representing the largest share of the population across the Midwest and outer South, White evangelicals most plentiful in the deep South and unaffiliated, secular Americans most common in the Northeast and especially the West. At CNN\u2019s request, PRRI research director Natalie Jackson crossed those findings with county-level results from the 2020 and 2016 presidential races. The results were striking. In 2020, White Christians made up 66% of the adult population in the nearly 2,600 counties Trump carried, many of them smaller and rural. In the nearly 550 counties that Biden carried (including 91 of the 100 largest), White Christians represented only 41% of the adult population. The difference was especially stark among White evangelical Christians: They composed 34% of the population in the Trump counties, compared with just 15% in the Biden counties. By contrast, non-White Christians represented almost 1 in 4 adults in the Biden counties, compared with about 1 in 10 in the Trump counties. Other Christians \u2013 a diverse group that includes Asian, Native American, mixed-race and Orthodox Christians as well as Jehovah\u2019s Witnesses \u2013 constituted a comparably small share in each man\u2019s counties (about 1 in 16). But those who subscribe to non-Christian faiths or no faith at all were a much bigger presence in the Biden counties (roughly 3 in 10) than Trump\u2019s (about 2 in 10). This divergence was even greater in the counties that gave each side its biggest margins. In the nearly 1,100 counties Trump won by 50 percentage points or more, White Christians made up more than 70% of the population, PRRI found. Trump amassed his biggest margins, beating Biden by 80 percentage points or more, almost entirely in smaller rural counties \u2013 like Roberts, Borden, King and Armstrong counties in Texas or Hayes, McPherson and Grant in Nebraska \u2013 where White Christians represented about three-fourths or more of the population. By contrast, they made up fewer than one-third of all residents in the roughly 170 counties that Biden won by at least 30 percentage points; in Biden\u2019s 20 best counties, most of them larger urban centers, White Christians constituted more than one-fourth of the population in just five. These county-level results confirm the religious divide evident in exit polls and other studies that analyzed the 2020 election results. In the recently released Pew Research Center \u201cValidated Voters\u201d study, for instance, Trump crushed by Biden by almost 70 percentage points among White evangelical Christians and posted solid (if reduced from 2016) margins of about 15 percentage points among both White mainline Protestants and White Catholics. Strong liberal social movements have persisted in both denominations for decades (particularly around issues of racial justice), but the fact that Biden, a White Catholic who positioned himself as a centrist, couldn\u2019t push his vote with those groups much past 40% underscored how many barriers Democrats face with the bulk of their believers. Biden, in turn, dominated among secular voters and non-White Christians (though Trump apparently ran more competitively, as Republicans often do, among Hispanic Protestants, many of whom are evangelicals). Like polls in previous presidential elections, the Pew analysis also found that within each religious denomination Trump, as other Republican nominees before him, generally ran better with the voters who attended religious services most often, while Biden did better with those who attended less frequently, according to detailed results Pew provided me. Jones says it\u2019s too early to tell if the recent stabilization in the White Christian share of the population represents a new plateau or merely a pause in their long decline. One key factor argues for the latter assessment: White Christians make up only a little more than 1 in 4 adults under 30 in PRRI\u2019s data, compared with nearly 6 in 10 of those over 65. As the former continue to replace the latter in American society, that disparity suggests White Christians are more likely than not to continue shrinking through the 2020s. When measuring America by race and religion White Christians will likely remain the nation\u2019s largest single group for years, but without the preponderant numbers that made them the clear first among equals in US life for earlier generations. How White Christians respond to that change in status will play a huge role in determining whether America\u2019s political tensions continue to escalate. (The question is equally pertinent for Whites without college degrees, another core GOP group that also has, for the first time, fallen below a majority of the US population in this century.) As the new PRRI county data for 2016 and 2020 shows, a strong majority of White Christians have flocked to Trump\u2019s promise to \u201cmake America great again\u201d and implicitly restore a social order that placed them at its center. If that large a share of White Christians responded to such arguments when they still constituted a little over 40% of the population, there\u2019s little reason to think that if their numbers shrink further fewer will be drawn to Trump-style messaging \u2013 even as he grows more overtly hostile to democracy. This process of contraction and radicalization is most apparent among White evangelicals, as evidenced by the conflict between relative moderates and militant conservatives in the Southern Baptist Convention. \u201cMy fear is that what\u2019s going to happen is as the group shrinks it\u2019s going to become more extreme and what\u2019ll end up happening is that the moderating voices in that group will leave and then it becomes even more extreme,\u201d says Jones. Such a \u201cradicalization spiral\u201d is very hard to break, he notes, and provides a huge pool of disaffected Whites willing to subvert democratic rules \u2013 or even resort to violence \u2013 if that\u2019s what it takes to prevent a diverse and increasingly secular liberal coalition from, in their view, remaking American society. \u201cIt\u2019s a crisis,\u201d Jones says flatly. \u201cThere\u2019s no other way to say it.\u201d",

            "article_content": "A version of this story appeared in CNN\u2019s Race Deconstructed newsletter. To get it in your inbox every week, sign up for free here. Spare a thought for critical race theory. It wasn\u2019t always a conservative bogeyman. Especially over the past several months, Republicans have distorted CRT \u2013 an academic frame that scholars such as Kimberl\u00e9 Crenshaw have been using in graduate-level courses for decades to interrogate how the legal system entrenches racism \u2013 into a catchall to describe things they don\u2019t like. In this bastardized telling, CRT is whatever Republicans want it to be; it comes in many guises. \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d is one name for CRT. \u201cSocial justice\u201d is another. \u201cIdentity,\u201d yet another. \u201cReparations.\u201d \u201cAlly-ship.\u201d \u201cDiversity.\u201d But to linger on what CRT is, or isn\u2019t, is to miss the more pressing concern: Why have Republicans latched onto a decades-old academic term? \u201d \u2018Strung together, the phrase \u201ccritical race theory\u201d connotes hostile, academic, divisive, race-obsessed, poisonous, elitist, anti-American,\u2019 \u201d explained Christopher F. Rufo, one of the conservative activists who \u2013 with the help of Fox News, a network that\u2019s become its own language \u2013 engineered the panic over CRT. Because so many Americans don\u2019t know what CRT is, it\u2019s the perfect tool for scaring White conservative voters with made-up problems \u2013 for mobilizing them against the racial awakening of the past year. Here\u2019s how we got here: The panic over CRT is hardly the first time that the US has seen such ethnonationalist fearmongering. In a recent Twitter thread, Pomona College politics professor Omar Wasow argued that one way to understand the anxiety over CRT is as \u201ca reactionary counter-mobilization.\u201d Wasow, who was previously at Princeton University and whose research focuses largely on protest movements, said that he was struck by how the present-day backlash to CRT echoes the dynamics of the 1960s. \u201cWhat we saw in some cases in the \u201960s was that, as the civil rights movement was able to capture the moral high ground in a national conversation on race, that knocked pro-segregation forces on their heels,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cThere was a period of trying to regroup and find an issue to mobilize around when, nationally, being pro-segregation became highly stigmatized.\u201d Republicans sought to reframe the world. For instance, they heeded the cruel logic of \u201claw and order,\u201d a dog whistle used against the civil rights protests of the era. This maneuvering was part of what University of Arkansas political science professors Angie Maxwell and Todd Shields call the \u201cLong Southern Strategy,\u201d a series of decisions on race, religion and feminism that Republicans made starting in the \u201960s to court White conservative voters in the South. In the year since the murder of George Floyd and the renewed demands for racial justice, Republicans have once again detected a need to reposition themselves, to turn a cultural shift into a sense of crisis that they can use to their advantage. (Republicans are doing something similar in their war against transgender students, as The Atlantic\u2019s Adam Serwer keenly pointed out.) \u201cWe saw Donald Trump try to run on \u2018law and order\u2019 and lose. It didn\u2019t seem to have the same punch that it did in the \u201960s, when Nixon invoked \u2018law and order\u2019 and won the White House. So, there\u2019s been this process of searching for a new issue,\u201d Wasow said. \u201cThere was a period when leading Republicans were complaining about \u2018cancel culture,\u2019 how Dr. Seuss was supposedly being canceled. But it never seemed to stick. So, I think that we\u2019re seeing this kind of elite process of trying to find an issue to mobilize around for the 2022, and maybe even 2024, elections. And CRT is one that\u2019s really hit a nerve.\u201d Conservative media outlets also play a role in anti-CRT mobilization, broadcasting an invented problem to their millions of viewers. \u201cInstead of debating CRT\u2019s merit, right-wing talkers have simply sought to demonize it,\u201d CNN\u2019s Oliver Darcy wrote for the Reliable Sources newsletter. This conscious obsession with CRT has helped it leap \u201cfrom the TV screen into state legislatures and local communities.\u201d It makes sense to situate the controversy around CRT not only within the history of race and racism in the US but also within the larger arc of demographic change. One crucial dimension of this change: the country\u2019s ballooning racial diversity and its effect on White identity politics, which Duke University political science professor Ashley Jardina describes as White Americans\u2019 increasingly active identification with their racial group. \u201cVarious studies find that when White people are exposed to information about social change \u2013 demographic change, in particular \u2013 they express more politically conservative views,\u201d Wasow told CNN. \u201cSo, there\u2019s a larger conversation happening right now about whether the US is going to be a multiracial democracy \u2013 in which there\u2019s no dominant group \u2013 or hold onto what has historically been a kind of ethno-racial majority, a White Christian-dominant majority.\u201d It\u2019s no exaggeration to say that the assault on the US Capitol on January 6 \u2013 when insurrectionists waving Confederate flags and pledging their allegiance to Trump tried to overturn the 2020 presidential election \u2013 was a deadly manifestation of a White nationalist vision. Wasow added that such dueling visions are at the core of the contest between Trump and his ilk on the one hand and figures such as Barack Obama and Joe Biden on the other. In publicly advocating for the birther conspiracy theory about a decade ago, Trump wasn\u2019t merely slandering one of his political opponents. He was attempting to delegitimize the multiracial coalition that installed Obama in the White House. This battle over a country in transition continues today. \u201cI think that the panic over CRT can be seen as part of this underlying anxiety about the status of White Americans in a changing country. That fear is sharper in moments like the aftermath of a protest movement calling for things like reforming policing and thinking harder about race in schools and hiring,\u201d Wasow said. These demands unsettle the status quo. Anti-CRT mobilization, then, is really a means of reaffirming the perceived legitimacy of the status quo. But let\u2019s give Crenshaw the final word on the controversy. After all, she\u2019s one of the pioneers of CRT. \u201cCritical race theory is not anti-patriotic,\u201d she told CNN\u2019s Jason Carroll. \u201cIn fact, it is more patriotic than those who are opposed to it \u2013 because we believe in the 13th and the 14th and the 15th Amendments. We believe in the promises of equality. And we know we can\u2019t get there if we can\u2019t confront and talk honestly about inequality.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Hillary Clinton called out the Republican-led crackdown on voting rights and urged Americans to fight for access to the ballot box in an op-ed published Wednesday. \u201cWe are witnessing a concerted attempt to destabilize the democratic process and delegitimize our multi-racial democracy, carried out in full view of the American people. As Democrats, it\u2019s not enough to push back one law, one court case or even one election at a time. We need to fundamentally change the way we think about and fight back against this blatant, sweeping effort,\u201d Clinton wrote in the op-ed, which published on Democracy Docket, the progressive platform founded by former Clinton campaign counsel Marc Elias. Republicans \u2013 who control both chambers of 30 state legislatures \u2013 have enacted 28 state laws since the 2020 election that restrict ballot access, according to a tally as of June 21 by the Brennan Center for Justice at the New York University School of Law. The laws in 17 states mark a new record for restrictive voting laws since 2011, when the Brennan Center recorded 19 laws enacted in 14 state legislatures. More than half of these new laws make it harder to vote absentee and by mail, after a record number of Americans voted by mail in November. Clinton addressed the blitz of new voting restrictions, referencing efforts to remove names from voter registration rolls, limitations on drop boxes, early and absentee voting and restrictions on giving voters food and water in polling lines. \u201cEach of these proposals disproportionately prevents people of color from casting their ballots, and each is egregious in its own right,\u201d Clinton wrote, adding the recent crackdown on voting access is the product of years of GOP-backed efforts such as gerrymandering and court packing paired with disinformation. Clinton also chastised the Supreme Court, which last week ruled that two provisions of an Arizona voting law that restrict how ballots can be cast do not violate the historic Voting Rights Act that bars regulations that result in racial discrimination. The 2016 Democratic presidential nominee invoked former President Donald Trump, his efforts to overturn the results of the 2020 election and his baseless claims of election fraud, and said that the insurrection at the Capitol on January 6 \u201cshowed that these fanatical ideas can lead to real, even deadly harm.\u201d \u201cThe emboldening of white supremacists and conspiracy theorists during Trump\u2019s campaign and time in the White House along with the international movement against liberal democracy have exacerbated this perfect storm,\u201d Clinton wrote. Clinton said that while she supports efforts in Congress to pass voting rights legislation, it will take more from American citizens to protect the right to vote. \u201cWe need to call these attacks on voting what they are: part of a clear attempt to move away from a pluralistic, multi-racial democracy and toward white supremacist authoritarianism,\u201d she wrote. \u201cWhen the people make their voices heard in an election, we should respect the results. These aren\u2019t partisan statements; they\u2019re attributes of a functioning democracy. Now is the time for anyone who cares about ours to stand up and fight for it using absolutely every tool in our toolbox,\u201d she said.

            "article_content": "Alvin Bragg is set to win the Democratic primary for the Manhattan District Attorney\u2019s Office, after his top challenger conceded Thursday \u2013 setting the former state and federal prosecutor up to eventually lead the investigation into the Trump Organization. Bragg will likely succeed current district attorney Cyrus Vance, whose term is set to expire at the end of the year, as Manhattan is largely Democratic. He\u2019ll first face Republican Thomas Keniff, a former prosecutor, JAG lawyer, Iraq war veteran and defense attorney in the general election in November. If he wins the general election, Bragg would become the first Black leader of the prominent prosecutors\u2019 office. \u201cThis has been a long journey that started in Harlem. And today, that 15-year old boy who was stopped numerous times at gunpoint by the police is the Democratic nominee to be Manhattan District Attorney,\u201d Bragg said in a statement to CNN. \u201cWe are one step closer to making history and transforming the District Attorney\u2019s office to deliver safety and justice for all.\u201d According to the New York City Board of Elections, as of June 23, Bragg was leading Tali Farhadian Weinstein with 34% of the vote, while she had 30%. There are nearly 40,000 absentee ballots cast that have not yet been reported. Farhadian Weinstein said in a statement that she congratulated Bragg on Friday afternoon for his historic win. \u201cWe had important disagreements throughout the campaign, but I am confident in Alvin\u2019s commitment to justice, and I stand ready to support him,\u201d Farhadian Weinstein said. If Bragg wins the general election in November, he would take the helm of the first criminal case against former President Donald Trump\u2019s company, which was charged Thursday, along with its Chief Financial Officer Allen Weisselberg, in a 15-count indictment that alleged a scheme to defraud, amongst other charges. The former President himself was not charged. Bragg has largely remained silent about how he would handle the investigation, but in January told radio show \u201cEbro in the Morning\u201d he\u2019s prepared to follow the facts in the case. \u201cI\u2019ve seen him up front and have seen the lawlessness that he can do,\u201d Bragg said in the interview. \u201cI believe we have to hold him accountable. I haven\u2019t seen all the facts beyond the public but I\u2019ve litigated with him and so I\u2019m prepared to go where the facts take me once I see them and hold him accountable.\u201d Bragg was most recently a New York State Chief Deputy Attorney General where he oversaw the work of both the criminal justice and social justice divisions. He oversaw a lawsuit against Harvey Weinstein and his company that alleged a hostile work environment. While at the attorney general\u2019s office, he helped sued the Trump administration more than 100 times, and led the team that sued the Donald J. Trump Foundation, which resulted in Trump personally paying $2 million to an array of charities and the foundation being dissolved. Bragg is also a former assistant US attorney in the criminal division of the US Attorney\u2019s Office for the Southern District of New York. Bragg said in a statement Friday that he is committed to ending racial disparities and mass incarceration, and campaigned not to prosecute low level crimes, something his challenger Kenniff said he disagrees with. \u201cI look forward to an informed and spirited race where voters will have an opportunity to decide between my public safety-first platform and my opponent\u2019s permissive approach to criminal justice,\u201d Kenniff said in a statement to CNN Friday.",

            "article_content": "The Supreme Court under Chief Justice John Roberts has hollowed out the historic Voting Rights Act, curtailed regulation of big political donors and limited challenges to partisan gerrymandering. The final two decisions of the court session on Thursday continued this trend of Roberts\u2019 stewardship that cuts to the heart of democracy and generally benefits conservatives over liberals, Republican voters over Democratic voters. The pattern on voting rights traces to Roberts\u2019 early years serving in the Ronald Reagan administration when the young GOP lawyer opposed racial remedies and argued for a constricted interpretation of the 1965 Voting Rights Act. Major 6-3 rulings foreshadow a sharper Supreme Court right turn That emphasis reemerged again Thursday, just as Attorney General Merrick Garland has pointed to a \u201cdramatic rise in state legislative actions that will make it harder for millions of citizens to cast a vote that counts.\u201d Dissenting liberal justices on Thursday observed that \u201cefforts to suppress the minority vote continue\u201d yet \u201cno one would know this from reading the majority opinion.\u201d RELATED: How the Supreme Court laid the path for Georgia\u2019s new election law The annual court session had been largely defined by incremental and often consensus moves, including to reject a third challenge to the Obama-sponsored Affordable Care Act and to compromise on a clash between LGBTQ interests and religious liberty. But the final action in two politically charged disputes showed the justices returning to predictable camps, the six Republican-appointed conservatives prevailing over the three Democratic-appointed liberals. The Roberts Court has also sought over the years to restrain government regulation of money in politics, most notably in the 2010 Citizens United decision. And two years ago, a Roberts-led majority prevented federal courts from ever hearing challenges to extreme partisan gerrymanders, drawn by state legislators to entrench the party in power. In the final decision of the 2020-21 term, as Roberts tossed out the California mandate that nonprofits turn over the names of major donors, the chief rejected the state\u2019s arguments regarding anti-fraud and other law enforcement purposes. He emphasized that \u201cdisclosure requirements can chill\u201d First Amendment free association rights, agreeing with the challengers that donors could be dissuaded by potential public exposure. The challenges were brought by the Americans for Prosperity Foundation, affiliated with the powerful Koch family, and the Thomas More Law Center, a Christian advocacy group. Supreme Court invalidates California's donor disclosure requirement \u201cThe upshot is that California casts a dragnet for sensitive donor information from tens of thousands of charities each year, even though that information will become relevant in only a small number of cases involved filed complaints,\u201d Roberts wrote. Some liberal critics beyond the court said the decision in the case outside the campaign finance context could crimp political regulations and lead to more anonymous contributions, so-called dark money, in campaigns. \u201cToday\u2019s analysis marks reporting and disclosure requirements with a bull\u2019s-eye,\u201d Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote in dissent. \u201cRegulated entities who wish to avoid their obligations can do so by vaguely waving toward First Amendment \u2018privacy concerns.\u2019\u201d Race and election law have long split the Roberts Court and in the past, those controversies came down to 5-4 votes. But with the succession of Justice Amy Coney Barrett for the late liberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg last October, the disputes fell along 6-3 conservative-liberal lines. The three appointees of former President Donald Trump are relatively young, likely entrenching the current trend for years. Roberts, now finishing his 16th term as chief justice, is himself only 66 and based on the usual judicial tenure could serve two more decades. Senior liberal Justice Stephen Breyer is 82 years old. All eyes on Stephen Breyer's retirement plans as Supreme Court term ends The Arizona case offered a new Roberts Court milestone on the breadth of the Voting Rights Act, adopted amid the nation\u2019s epic civil rights struggles and only after the March 1965 \u201cBloody Sunday\u201d attack on marchers crossing the Edmund Pettus Bridge in Selma, Alabama. The disputed Arizona policies required ballots cast by people at the wrong precinct to be wholly discarded and separately criminalized third-party collection of absentee ballots, for example from residents at a nursing home. The Democratic National Committee, along with state Democrats, had argued that wide swaths of Native Americans, Latino and Black voters could be disenfranchised by the restrictions. The Republican National Committee and state Republicans defended the measures as modest steps to protect election integrity. The two sides offered competing views of the Voting Rights Act Section 2, which bars practices that racially discriminate. Challengers can prevail if they show a practice arose from a discriminatory purpose but also if it had the \u201cresult\u201d of denying racial minorities\u2019 equal opportunity to participate in elections. That latter section was at the heart of the case. A federal appeals court had ruled that both Arizona ballot rules violated that so-called \u201cresults\u201d test, in a decision that declared, \u201cFor over a century, Arizona has repeatedly targeted its American Indian, Hispanic, and African American citizens, limiting or eliminating their ability to vote and to participate in the political process.\u201d Hearing the Republican appeal, the Roberts Court picked up where it left off in 2013. John Roberts is all business in his conservatism That decision in Shelby County v. Holder eviscerated a separate VRA provision, known as Section 5, that demanded states with a history of discrimination obtain federal approval for any new electoral change, such as to district lines, ballot ID rules or polling operations. Roberts had authored that 5-4 decision premised on the notion that the country no longer needed to take special steps to prevent voter discrimination based on race. \u201cOur country has changed,\u201d Roberts wrote eight years ago, \u201cand while any racial discrimination in voting is too much, Congress must ensure that the legislation it passes to remedy that problem speaks to current conditions.\u201d Elimination of \u201cpreclearance\u201d generated a raft of new state ballot rules and forced voting rights advocates to rely more on Section 2 of the VRA. On Thursday, the conservative majority said neither Arizona restriction violated the VRA as it enhanced the ability of states to defend themselves against Section 2 challenges. Writing for the majority, Justice Samuel Alito said dissenting liberals were partly fighting the battle of eight years ago. As the senior justice among the six in the majority, Roberts assigned the case to Alito. The two men were appointed within months of each other by President George W. Bush and have been allies on voting rights controversies. Toobin: Voting Rights Act close to being irrelevant The majority rejected the lower court\u2019s dire assessment of the voting restrictions, stating, for example, \u201cHaving to identify one\u2019s own polling place and then travel there to vote does not exceed the \u2018usual burdens of voting.\u2019\u201d Alito also rejected a focus on a voting procedure\u2019s disparate impact on racial minorities or any \u201cartificially magnified\u201d differences. \u201cSmall disparities are less likely than large ones to indicate that a system is not equally open,\u201d Alito wrote. \u201cTo the extent that minority and non-minority groups differ with respect to employment, wealth, and education, even neutral regulations, no matter how crafted, may well result in some predictable disparities in rates of voting and noncompliance with voting rules. \u201cBut the mere fact there is some disparity in impact does not necessarily mean that a system is not equally open or that it does not give everyone an equal opportunity to vote,\u201d Alito\u2019s majority opinion added. \u201cWhat is tragic here,\u201d Justice Elena Kagan asserted in her dissent for the three liberals, \u201cis that the Court has (yet again) rewritten \u2013 in order to weaken \u2013 a statute that stands as a monument to America\u2019s greatness, and protects against its basest impulses.\u201d Kagan said the majority\u2019s approach \u201cignores the sweep of\u201d the VRA objective that \u201cminority citizens can access the electoral system as easily as whites.\u201d She invoked Roberts\u2019 view in the Shelby County case that \u201cthings have changed dramatically\u201d and then said, \u201cMaybe some think that vote suppression is a relic of history\u2014and so the need for a potent Section 2 has come and gone.\u201d But, she concluded, \u201cCongress gets to make that call. Because it has not done so, this Court\u2019s duty is to apply the law as it is written. The law that confronted one of this country\u2019s most enduring wrongs; pledged to give every American, of every race, an equal chance to participate in our democracy; and now stands as the crucial tool to achieve that goal. That law, of all laws, deserves the sweep and power Congress gave it. That law, of all laws, should not be diminished by this Court.",

            "article_content": "All term long the Supreme Court has been the target of political players as members of Congress called for a \u201clegislative solution,\u201d the Biden administration launched a commission to study court reform and progressive groups claimed that court packing measures were necessary to \u201csave\u201d the Supreme Court. Meanwhile, conservatives relished the possibility of a swift right turn with their new 6-3 majority after Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg died last September and Amy Coney Barrett joined the bench the next month. By the last day of the term, the justices finally issued their own verdict. Supreme Court gives Republican-led states green light to impose restrictive new voting laws They handed out a pair of decisions with deep political undertones that will bolster the narratives put forward by the poles of both parties. The justices also foreshadowed fissures that will likely widen next year as the court hears blockbuster cases with broad social implications concerning abortion, the Second Amendment and possibly affirmative action. Which isn\u2019t to say that the term wasn\u2019t entirely made up of 6-3 opinions on ideological lines. Two of the most important cases of the term were 7-2 and 9-0 and there were 29 unanimous opinions. But Republicans and conservatives are finally getting the decisions they pined for as former President Donald Trump changed the face of the courts and liberals are preparing for a bloodbath. The court\u2019s new majority was in full force on Thursday as it limited the ability for minorities to challenge state laws they believe are discriminatory under the historic Voting Rights Act in a case involving two Arizona laws that a lower court said had a disparate impact on minorities in the state. Justice Samuel Alito, echoing comments from Trump and Republican-led states claiming election fraud from last year\u2019s presidential election, reversed and stressed for a 6-3 court what he called a state\u2019s \u201centirely legitimate interest\u201d in the prevention of fraud. He said that the Arizona laws were akin to the \u201cusual burdens of voting\u201d and added that while the Voting Rights Act \u201cexemplifies our country\u2019s commitment to democracy\u201d the law does \u201cnot deprive the States of their authority to establish non- discriminatory voting rules.\u201d His opinion drew a fierce dissent from Justice Elena Kagan who said the majority had \u201cno right to remake\u201d the law and that it \u201cshould not be diminished by this court.\u201d All eyes on Stephen Breyer's retirement plans as Supreme Court term ends Thomas A. Saenz, president of the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund said in a statement that the court\u2019s \u201cmajority is woefully disconnected from social and historical reality, particularly when it comes to the experiences of racial minorities who continue to face daily depredations of basic rights in our country.\u201d President Joe Biden, the Justice Department and liberal groups also criticized the ruling. In another case Thursday, Chief Justice John Roberts, writing for the same 6-3 divide, invalidated a California regulation that required charities to disclose their donors. He said the law \u201ccasts a dragnet\u201d for sensitive information and that the state lacked a good justification. Justice Sonia Sotomayor, writing for the liberals, expressed fear that the decision will likely lead to the invalidation of other donor disclosure laws which would allow more \u201canonymous\u201d money into the political system. In June, the justices also divided along ideological lines in ruling that California cannot allow unions to enter the property of agricultural businesses to address workers, unless the businesses are compensated for the visit, in a case that could have broad property rights implications. Roberts, again showing his solid conservative bona fides, was at the helm as the court dealt another blow to public sector unions. Roberts said that allowing the workers on the property, even for brief periods of time amounted to an unconstitutional \u201ctaking\u201d of the property. Justice Stephen Breyer, writing for the liberal dissenters, feared the decision would \u201cthreaten to make many ordinary forms of regulation unusually complex or impractical.\u201d Barrett\u2019s impact was also felt in fights over religious liberty implications of state Covid restrictions. When Ginsburg was still alive, the court voted in favor of the states with Roberts serving as the swing vote. But after Barrett\u2019s confirmation, the houses of worship won. In one order concerning California, the court actually moved the law on religious liberty, something that doesn\u2019t often occur on what is called the \u201cshadow docket\u201d where emergency orders are produced without the benefit of briefs and oral arguments. John Roberts is all business in his conservatism The vote count in one of the highest-profile cases of the term was 7-2. It concerned what Alito called \u201cthe third installment in our epic Affordable Care Act trilogy.\u201d Republican-led states and individual plaintiffs argued that when Congress amended Obamacare in 2017 bringing the tax penalty down to zero, it removed the legal underpinning of the individual mandate (that the law was legal as a tax) rendering the entire, sprawling law unconstitutional. Seven justices dismissed the dispute on the grounds that the Republican led states did not have the legal right or \u201cstanding\u201d to bring their challenge because they couldn\u2019t show a concrete injury related to the action Congress took. Roberts \u2013 perhaps in an effort to avoid headlines that he had \u201csaved\u201d the law again after his controversial vote in 2012 \u2013 assigned the opinion to Breyer. At oral argument, liberal Justice Elena Kagan, a keen tactician, had hinted at the result when she questioned a lawyer for the Trump administration. \u201cThe United States is usually pretty stingy about standing law,\u201d she said. She left unsaid the fact that conservative justices are also usually more stingy when it comes to who can bring a case to court. Notably, neither Kagan, Breyer nor Sotomayor chose to explain their thinking by writing separately, relieved, perhaps, that the challenge would go away and health care insurance would stand in the wake of a worldwide pandemic. Even conservative Justice Clarence Thomas, who made clear his distaste for previous ruling in favor of the law, agreed that the challenges \u201chave not identified any unlawful action that has injured them.\u201d \u201cAlthough this Court has erred twice before in cases involving the Affordable Care Act, it does not err today,\u201d he said. Alito, writing a dissent double the size of the majority opinion and joined only by Gorsuch, rejected the majority\u2019s standing argument. He said he would have ruled in favor of the states behind the challenge and to invalidate the law. \u201cNo one can fail to be impressed by the lengths to which this Court has been willing to go to defend the ACA against all threats,\u201d Alito wrote. \u201cFans of judicial inventiveness will applaud once again.\u201d And in a footnote, he suggested more challenges to come. \u201cMany other parties will have standing\u201d to bring claims, he said. In another of the term\u2019s marquee cases, all nine members sided with a Catholic foster agency that refused to work with same sex couples as potential foster parents out of religious objections to same-sex marriage. It was a clear win for the agency and a loss for Philadelphia that argued that the agency violated a state anti-discrimination law. Roberts wrote for six of the justices. But Alito, again, was not satisfied with a modest path Roberts took tying the decision in large part to the fact that the contract between the city and the agency allowed for some exemptions even as the city refused to grant the agency an exemption for its religious objections. Justice Samuel Alito swung for the fences on religious liberty and came up short, but isn't done yet This time, Alito garnered the support of Gorsuch and Thomas and wrote a 77-page concurrence (about three times longer than Roberts\u2019 opinion) to lay out how the court should have gone much further to overrule precedent and issue a landmark opinion. He said that his colleagues relied upon \u201cwhat appears to be a superfluous\u201d and \u201cshort lived\u201d feature of the City\u2019s standard annual contract with foster care agencies. \u201cThis decision might as well be written on the dissolving paper sold in magic shops,\u201d Alito lamented. He said if the city \u201cwants to get around the decision \u201cit can simply eliminate the never-used exemption power\u201d and \u201cvoila, today\u2019s decision will vanish.\u201d Court watchers were perplexed by the long-term implications of Roberts\u2019 opinion. Progressives were relieved and divined that Breyer, Kagan and Sotomayor sought common ground in an effort to head off a broader decision that would have overturned precedent from 1990 and make it much harder for the government to pass laws that allegedly impinge upon religious beliefs. In another opinion, the court unanimously sided with student athletes who challenged certain NCAA spending restrictions on educated related benefits. The court again, dealt just with the case at hand, with the majority saying they were not taking a look at the larger question concerning other spending limits that the NCAA say are justified in order to maintain its amateur status. Only Justice Brett Kavanaugh, noted basketball fan and middle school coach, went further. He agreed with the court\u2019s opinion but suggested that the NCAA business model is in trouble. Late in the term the court also left in place a lower court opinion that allowed a transgender male public school student to use the bathroom that he said corresponded with his gender identity. Although another challenge could make its way up to the Supreme Court it was clear victory for LGBTQ rights and only Thomas and Alito noted that they would have taken up the dispute. McConnell haunts Democrats with new threat to block Biden court nominee At the end of the first term with all three of Trump\u2019s appointees on the bench \u2013 Gorsuch, Kavanaugh and Barrett \u2013 proved that Trump did not always get what he wanted in the short term, although in the long-term judges will likely be his most lasting legacy. Asked by Real America about his Supreme Court picks, the former President said he was \u201cdisappointed\u201d with the vote on Obamacare and other rulings. \u201cDisappointed, and that\u2019s the way it goes. \u2026 I fought very hard for them but I was very disappointed with a number of their rulings,\u201d he said. It was that way for him all term. The court rebuffed his hopes to overturn election results. It ultimately allowed his tax returns to go out to a New York prosecutor. And it allowed the ACA, the most important legislative achievement of the Obama administration and that Trump vowed to destroy, in place.",

            "article_content": "The restrictive voting laws that Republican-led states are implementing this year are more likely to withstand legal challenges, experts said, after the Supreme Court on Thursday gave states the tacit green light to go as far as they want in imposing measures they say are intended to combat election fraud \u2013 even at the cost of protections for minority voters. The court\u2019s ruling came in an Arizona case, in which Democrats had challenged two voting restrictions: one requiring ballots cast at the wrong precinct to be thrown out; and one prohibiting campaign workers, activists and others from collecting and returning ballots, a practice that Republicans have called \u201cballot harvesting.\u201d In its 6-3 ruling siding with Arizona, experts said, the Supreme Court signaled that it would likely side with other states enacting new voting restrictions in the name of preventing voter fraud. Republican-controlled statehouses have seized on former President Donald Trump\u2019s lie that widespread voter fraud cost him the 2020 election, rushing to implement new restrictions on practices that Democrats and voting rights advocates say broaden access to the ballot box, including mail-in voting and early voting. \u201cAlthough lower courts will have to sort through exactly how much harder today\u2019s ruling will make it to challenge voting restrictions, the one undeniable point is that more of the post-2020 state restrictions will survive under today\u2019s ruling than would have before today,\u201d said Steve Vladeck, CNN Supreme Court analyst and professor at the University of Texas Law. Already, 17 states have enacted 28 laws since the 2020 election that restrict ballot access, according to a new tally as of June 21 by the Brennan Center for Justice at the New York University School of Law. Georgia and Florida are among the presidential battleground states that have implemented strict new voting laws. The Republican-led legislature in Texas was blocked from doing so when Democrats walked out on the final hours of this year\u2019s legislative session, but GOP lawmakers are expected to try again in a special session scheduled for next week. Pennsylvania\u2019s Democratic governor, Tom Wolf, this week vetoed new voting restrictions approved by the Republican-led legislature there. Republicans who control the Michigan legislature have also advanced measures that would make it harder to vote, and GOP officials there have plotted ways to circumvent Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer\u2019s veto. Rick Hasen, a voting rights expert at the UC Irvine School of Law, wrote in a blog post that \u201cthe conservative Supreme Court has taken away all the major available tools for going after voting restrictions.\u201d He said the court\u2019s ruling makes it harder to prove intentional racial discrimination \u2013 \u201cmaking it that much harder\u201d for the Justice Department to win its recently announced lawsuit challenging a new voting law implemented this year by Georgia\u2019s Republican-led state legislature and GOP governor, Brian Kemp. \u201cThis decision is very harmful and it is going to make it harder for anyone to be able to challenge discriminatory voting laws,\u201d Arizona Secretary of State Katie Hobbs, a Democrat who is running for governor, said on CNN. Former Attorney General Eric Holder said that \u201cthe impact of this activist, ideologically-driven decision will be felt in the future and far outside the borders of Arizona. These laws, and others like them, are unnecessary, and they will result in the effective disenfranchisement of countless American citizens \u2013 especially people of color.\u201d Ultimately, Democrats\u2019 clearest path to halting states\u2019 restrictive voting laws is in Congress \u2013 where the party has broadly backed the For the People Act, which would create an automatic national voter registration system and establish standards for mail-in voting, and the John Lewis Voting Rights Act, a measure named for the late Georgia congressman and civil rights icon that aims to prevent states from implementing racially discriminatory voting laws. The John Lewis Voting Rights Act would do so by reviving a key provision of the Voting Rights Act of 1965: the requirement that states with a history of discriminatory voting laws get federal \u201cpreclearance\u201d before changing their voting laws. The Supreme Court struck that \u201cpreclearance\u201d requirement down in 2013. And in Thursday\u2019s ruling, the court said that the reality that restrictive voting laws could make it harder for Black and brown people to vote should not be \u201cartificially magnified\u201d because of differences in \u201cemployment, wealth, and education.\u201d \u201cTo the extent that minority and non-minority groups differ with respect to employment, wealth, and education, even neutral regulations, no matter how crafted, may well result in some predictable disparities in rates of voting and non- compliance with voting rules,\u201d Justice Samuel Alito wrote in the opinion backed by all six of the court\u2019s conservative members and opposed by its three liberals. The ruling was met with harsh criticism from progressives \u2013 on the Supreme Court, in Congress, on the campaign trail and in left-leaning organizations \u2013 who said it opens the door for more state laws that make it harder for people of color to cast ballots. \u201cWeaken the Voting Rights Act, and predictable consequences follow: yet a further generation of voter suppression laws,\u201d liberal Justice Elena Kagan wrote in her dissent. NAACP President Derrick Johnson called Thursday\u2019s court ruling \u201ca frontal attack on democracy\u201d and said the NAACP \u201cwill fight with everything we\u2019ve got to restore the Voting Rights Act to its full strength and ensure that voters of color are protected in exercising their right to fully participate in our democracy.\u201d The problem Democrats face is that reaching the Senate\u2019s 60-vote threshold to break the filibuster is impossible in the face of wide Republican opposition. And some Democrats, including West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin and Arizona Sen. Kyrsten Sinema, have opposed abolishing the filibuster to clear the way for new voting laws. Eliminating the filibuster has become a popular talking point among Democratic candidates ahead of 2022\u2019s midterm elections. Pennsylvania Lt. Gov. John Fetterman, who is running for the state\u2019s open Senate seat, said the court\u2019s ruling \u201cgave voter suppression the green light\u201d and said he would vote to abolish the filibuster to clear the way for new voter protections. \u201cThe Senate needs to act right now, and if I were in the Senate, I would proudly cast the 51st vote to abolish the filibuster and pass the For the People Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Act,\u201d he said in a statement shortly after the court\u2019s ruling. \u201cOur democracy depends on it.\u201d",

            "article_content": "The Supreme Court on Thursday said two provisions of an Arizona voting law that restrict how ballots can be cast do not violate the historic Voting Rights Act that bars regulations that result in racial discrimination. The ruling will limit the ability of minorities to challenge state laws in the future that they say are discriminatory under the Voting Rights Act. The vote in the case is 6-3 breaking along conservative-liberal ideological lines. Justice Samuel Alito delivered the majority opinion. The case comes as several Republican-led states, encouraged by former President Donald Trump\u2019s unfounded claims of widespread voter fraud, are considering more restrictive laws and Democrats are fighting a frantic battle in courts to combat what President Joe Biden has called an \u201cassault on democracy.\u201d Supreme Court invalidates California's donor disclosure requirement The court upheld two provisions of the Arizona law. The first provision says in-person ballots cast at the wrong precinct on Election Day must be wholly discarded. Another provision restricts a practice known as \u201cballot collection,\u201d requiring that only family caregivers, mail carriers and election officials can deliver another person\u2019s completed ballot to a polling place. \u201cNeither Arizona\u2019s out-of-precinct rule nor its ballot-collection law violates \u00a72 of the VRA,\u201d Alito wrote. \u201cArizona\u2019s out-of-precinct rule enforces the requirement that voters who choose to vote in person on election day must do so in their assigned precincts. Having to identify one\u2019s own polling place and then travel there to vote does not exceed the \u201cusual burdens of voting.\u2019\u201d Alito said that while the Voting Rights Act provides \u201cvital protection against discriminatory voting rules, and no one suggests that discrimination in voting has been extirpated or that the threat has been eliminated \u2026 Section Two of the law does not deprive the States of their authority to establish non-discriminatory voting rules.\u201d And touching on arguments made by Republicans and Trump, Alito said that \u201cone strong an entirely legitimate state interest is the prevention of fraud.\u201d \u201cFraud can affect the outcome of a close election, and fraudulent votes dilute the right of citizens to cast ballots that carry appropriate weight\u201d Alito wrote, adding that fraud can \u201calso undermine public confidence in the fairness of elections and the perceived legitimacy of the announced outcome.\u201d Steve Vladeck, CNN Supreme Court analyst and professor at the University of Texas School of Law, said the high court\u2019s decision on Thursday regarding voting rights and invalidating a California rule that requires charitable organizations that solicit donations to disclose a list of their contributors to the state attorney general, shows \u201cfull flavor\u201d of the court\u2019s new conservative majority. \u201cIn narrowing the Voting Rights Act and striking down California\u2019s donor disclosure rules, the Court is handing two major legal and political victories to Republicans \u2013 decisions that likely would not have been possible as recently as three years ago. One has to assume that it is a distinct and undeniable harbinger of things to come,\u201d Vladeck said Thursday. Justice Elena Kagan, writing for her two liberal colleagues, Justice Stephen Breyer and Sonia Sotomayor, accused the majority of trying to rewrite the law. \u201cNo matter what Congress wanted, the majority has other ideas,\u201d Kagan wrote, saying the court \u201chas no right to remake Section 2\u201d \u2013 only Congress does. \u201cThe law that confronted one of this country\u2019s most enduring wrongs; pledged to give every American, of every race, an equal chance to participate in our democracy,\u201d Kagan said, \u201cdeserves the sweep and power Congress gave it.\u201d \u201cThat law, of all laws, should not be diminished by this Court, \u201d she added. President Joe Biden said he is \u201cdeeply disappointed\u201d in Thursday\u2019s ruling. \u201cIn a span of just eight years, the Court has now done severe damage to two of the most important provisions of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 \u2013 a law that took years of struggle and strife to secure,\u201d Biden said in a statement. \u201cAfter all we have been through to deliver the promise of this Nation to all Americans, we should be fully enforcing voting rights laws, not weakening them.\u201d The 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals had invalidated both Arizona provisions under Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, stressing the state\u2019s \u201clong history of race-based discrimination against its American Indian, Hispanic, and African American citizens\u201d and highlighting a \u201cpattern of discrimination against minority voters has continued to the present day.\u201d While the Democratic National Committee urged the justices to affirm the ruling, Arizona\u2019s attorney general, the state Republican Party and the former Trump Justice Department told the court to reverse a lower court, uphold the provisions and establish legal a standard that could make it more difficult to bring claims under the Voting Rights Act in the future. READ: Supreme Court ruling on Voting Rights Act Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich, a Republican, told the justices that the voting rules represent \u201cappropriate election integrity measures that do not create any disparate impact on racial minorities, but serve us all equally well.\u201d \u201cArizona endorses without qualification the Voting Rights Act goal of ending racial discrimination in voting,\u201d he told the justices, and added that claims demonstrating that the law disparately impacts minovery voters can go forward. Absent such a showing, he said, \u201cSection 2 would exceed Congress\u2019s powers to enforce the Reconstruction amendments, improperly inject race into all voting laws, and impede a state\u2019s ability to run their elections.\u201d Michael Carvin, a lawyer for the state GOP, took a harder line. He asked the justices to hold that no challenges that concern neutral \u201ctime, manner, or place\u201d restrictions could be brought under Section 2. That could help greenlight many of the laws that are currently being passed in states like Texas and Georgia. Texas, for instance, is pushing for a ban on after-hours voting, and a mandate to limit Sunday early voting as well as requiring voters requesting absentee ballots to provide their driver\u2019s license number or Social Security number. For its part, the Biden administration filed a letter with the court agreeing that the two Arizona provisions did not violate the Voting Rights Act, but disagreed with the suggestion to limit future claims under the law. In court, Bruce Spiva, a lawyer for the DNC, reminded the justices that \u201cvoting discrimination still exists, no one doubts this.\u201d He said that minorities were twice as likely to be impacted by the out-ofprecinct law in part due to confusing placement of polling places and that the ballot collection law impacted Native Americans and Hispanic who depended upon it to cast absentee ballots. READ: Supreme Court ruling on California's donor disclosure requirement \u201cMore voting restrictions have been enacted over the last decade than at any point since the end of Jim Crow,\u201d Spiva said, adding that \u201cthe last three months have seen an even greater uptick in proposed voting restrictions, many aimed squarely at the minority groups whose participation Congress intended to protect.\u201d Thursday NAACP President Derrick Johnson said the ruling was a \u201cfrontal attack on democracy\u201d. \u201cThe Court sent the clear message that vote suppressors around the country will go unchecked as they enact voting restrictions that disproportionately impact voters of color,\u201d Johnson said. Eight years ago, Chief Justice John Roberts wrote the 5-4 majority opinion in Shelby County v. Holder, effectively gutting Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act, a provision that required states with a history of discrimination to obtain the permission of the federal government or the courts \u2013 known as \u201cpre-clearance\u201d \u2013 before enacting new laws related to voting. The justices struck down the provision of the law that determined which states would be covered, leaving it to Congress to update the formula. Congress has yet to act. Since then, challengers to voting rules had turned to Section 2 of the law that bars laws that result in discrimination. That section only allows lawsuits after the restriction has gone into effect.   In the years since, states once covered by those pre-clearance provisions have made far-reaching changes to their voting rules. They include Arizona, which in 2016, passed its law restricting who can return a ballot on behalf of a voter. The court\u2019s Arizona decision is considered crucial to the ongoing battles over voting rights because Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act is one of the few legal tools remaining to counteract laws viewed as disenfranchising Black and other minority voters. The US Justice Department is relying on Section 2 to sue the state of Georgia over the raft of voting restrictions the GOP-controlled legislature enacted this year. Those new provisions, which include discarding most out-of-precinct votes and restricting ballot box locations, were passed with the intent \u201cto deny or abridge the right of Black Georgians to vote on account of race or color,\u201d the DOJ alleged. Other groups suing to stop restrictive laws from taking effect in Georgia and other states also have centered their complaints, at least on part, on Section 2\u2019s anti-discrimination provisions. Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger applauded the ruling Thursday and said the Justice Department should \u201cheed this decision and dismiss their wrong, politically motivated lawsuit against Georgia.\u201d A short history of the long conservative assault on Black voting power This year has brought a wave of new laws restricting access to the ballot. Republican sponsors \u2013 spurred on by Trump\u2019s baseless fraud claims \u2013 say the new measures are needed to prevent wrongdoing and restore confidence in a voting system that saw record numbers of Americans cast their ballots by mail and other avenues of voting that opened up during the coronavirus pandemic. Democrats and voting rights advocates say the laws aim to discourage voting, particularly by minorities, college students and people with disabilities. In all, 17 states have enacted 28 new laws restricting voting as of June 21, according to the liberal-leaning Brennan Center for Justice. Sean Morales-Doyle, acting director of the voting rights and elections program at the Brennan Center, decried Thursday\u2019s ruling. \u201cToday the Supreme Court made it much harder to challenge discriminatory voting laws in court. The justices stopped short of eviscerating the Voting Rights Act, but nevertheless did significant damage to this vital civil rights law and to the freedom to vote,\u201d he said. In July, Republicans in the Texas legislature head into a special session where they are likely to revive some of the nation\u2019s most restrictive voting limits. The proposals in Texas could impose limits on absentee voting, grant new powers to partisan poll watches and take aim at new voting methods \u2013 such as drive-through and 24-hour voting \u2013 deployed in populous Harris County, home to Houston, last year. Democrats in Congress are working on a new version of the Voting Rights Act that tries to restore federal government\u2019s ability to pre-approve changes to voting practices in some states. Republican opposition to the legislation, however, makes that update unlikely to pass in an 50-50 Senate unless moderate Democrats agree to dismantle the 60-vote threshold needed to overcome a filibuster in the Senate to advance legislation. In his statement, Biden renewed calls to pass the \u201cFor the People Act\u201d and \u201cJohn Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act,\u201d said the ruling \u201cputs the burden back on Congress.\u201d \u201cThis is our life\u2019s work and the work of all of us,\u201d Biden wrote. \u201cDemocracy is on the line.\u201d This story has been updated with comments from President Biden.",

            "article_content": "More than half a year after the 2020 presidential election, research is starting to provide a more precise picture of the demographic composition of the 2020 electorate, how various groups voted, and what changed from previous elections. The latest entry, released Wednesday by the Pew Research Center, credits Joe Biden\u2019s victory over Donald Trump to shifts in key groups, including suburban voters and political independents, that \u201con balance\u2026helped Biden a little more than Trump.\u201d The report is based on a survey conducted after November\u2019s presidential election. In the months since, researchers went back to validate that participants actually voted by matching them against commercial voter files that aggregate official state turnout records. The results were also weighted to match the final election outcome. It joins an increasing body of election post-mortems, including a report from the Democratic data firm Catalist, as well as data from the 2020 exit polls and VoteCast. Election polls, as 2020 made clear, aren\u2019t precision instruments. The design of these projects helps to mitigate one source of pre-election polling error \u2013 the uncertainty over who\u2019ll eventually turn out to vote. They show a general consensus on some findings, such as the existence of stark divides along educational lines. But they diverge in others, such as their estimates of the precise racial composition of the electorate, a reminder that there\u2019s still significant uncertainty as there is no single source of definitive truth about who voted and for which candidates in US elections. The data can also tell a different story based on whether it\u2019s used to compare differences between multiple demographic groups in the most recent election, or used to track the way a single group\u2019s voting behavior has shifted over time. The new report finds, for instance, that Trump did better with Hispanic voters in 2020 than he did four years prior. At the same time, it\u2019s also true that Biden won broad majorities of Black, Hispanic and Asian voters in 2020, while losing the White vote to Trump. Here\u2019s a summary of Pew\u2019s findings about last year\u2019s election: GENDER: Female voters chose Biden over Trump by an 11-point margin, according to Pew\u2019s data, while male voters were closely divided, giving Trump only a 2-point edge. That\u2019s a significant shift from its view of the 2016 electorate, in which Pew found a much bigger gender gap, with women voting for Hillary Clinton by a 15-point margin, and Trump taking an 11-point lead among men. Other sources show a less dramatic change: Exit poll data, for instance, gave Trump an 8-point advantage with men in 2020, only a 3-point dip from 2016. In Catalist\u2019s reporting, Biden won 47% of the two-way vote among men in 2020, only a slight uptick from 44% in 2016. RACE: White voters went for Trump by a 12-point margin, Pew found, while Biden won Hispanic voters by 21 points, Asian voters by 44 points and Black voters by 84 points. Still,Trump\u2019s numbers with Hispanic voters were a significant improvement from 2016, when he lost that bloc to Clinton by 38 points. Biden\u2019s lead was much stronger among Hispanic voters with college degrees than it was among Hispanic voters who hadn\u2019t graduated from college, the analysis finds: he won by 39 points among the former, compared with 14 points among the latter. RELIGION: Overall, Protestants chose Trump by a 19-point margin, according to Pew, but underlying that figure is a yawning racial divide: White evangelical protestants chose Trump over Biden by a 69-point margin, an uptick from 2016, while Black Protestants went for Biden by an 82-point margin. Catholics were close to evenly split between the candidates, while followers of other religions favored Biden by 32 points. Those unaffiliated with a religious group backed him by a 45-point margin. AGE: Voters younger than 30 favored Biden by a 24-point margin, Pew found, with those ages 30 to 49 favoring him by a more modest 12 points. Trump had an edge of 6 points among those ages 50 to 64, and 4 points among those ages 65 and older. GEOGRAPHY: Biden won by a 33-percentage point margin among urban voters and by an 11-point margin among suburban voters, the analysis found, while Trump won by 32 points among rural voters. Biden performed more strongly with suburban voters than Clinton did in 2016, while Trump improved his performance among rural voters. EDUCATION: Levels of education, which emerged as an important division in the 2016 election, remained so in 2020, particularly among White voters. In Pew\u2019s data, Biden led Trump by 15 points among White voters with a college degree, but trailed Trump by 32 points among White voters who didn\u2019t attend college (a slight improvement for the Democrats from 2016, when Trump beat Clinton by 36 points among the same group.) The different sources for election data, however, diverge significantly in their estimates of the educational and racial divides. Exit polls, Catalist and VoteCast data all found Biden winning White college voters by a narrower margin than Pew\u2019s analysis does. Other data also showed less movement from 2016 among the White non-college vote. PARTISANSHIP AND VOTING HISTORY: Both candidates won the support of the vast majority of their party in 2020, Pew found. Biden won Democratic and Democratic-leaning voters by a 90-point margin, while Trump won Republicans and Republican leaders by an 86-point margin. The remainder of the electorate \u2013 independents who didn\u2019t lean toward either party, or supported another party \u2013 went for Biden by a 9-point margin, up from a near-even split between Trump and Clinton in 2016. Unlike 2016, last year\u2019s election didn\u2019t feature unusually high support for third-party candidates. Third-party 2016 voters who voted last year opted for Biden over Trump by a 17-point margin, with only a tenth again voting third-party. Both Biden and Trump brought in new and infrequent voters. According to Pew\u2019s data, one-quarter of 2020 voters hadn\u2019t voted in the previous presidential election, and 19% hadn\u2019t voted in either 2016 or 2018. Those who hadn\u2019t voted in either 2016 or 2018 were about equally split between the two candidates; Biden led among those who\u2019d voted in the midterms but not 2016, with Trump ahead among those who\u2019d voted in 2016 but skipped the midterms. Voters\u2019 choice of candidates is only one factor in determining an election outcome \u2013 the composition of the electorate also matters. Pew\u2019s analysis found that \u201cdespite notable changes in the demographics of the two candidates\u2019 coalitions,\u201d as well as high turnout and a record level of absentee voting, \u201cthe demographic composition of the electorate as a whole in 2020 did not differ much from that of 2016.\u201d What did change dramatically was the way people voted. Amid the Covid-19 pandemic, a record 46% of voters said they\u2019d voted absentee or by mail. Of that group, 43% said it was their first time ever voting that way. The Pew Research Center surveyed 11,818 US adults in November 2020, 10,640 adults in November 2018 and 4,183 adults in November and December 2016, using the nationally representative American Trends Panel.

They\u2019re supposed to shoot BLM, but they\u2019re shooting the patriots.\u201d That was one of the Trump-supporting insurrectionists who laid siege to the US Capitol on January 6 in a deadly attempt to overturn the election that secured the White House for Joe Biden. She was expressing a sentiment that many Trumpists share: that the US belongs to Donald Trump (who at the time of the Capitol riot was still in the White House) and his overwhelmingly White disciples. The dangerous messaging here is that they\u2019re the real Americans, not the people who reject Trumpists\u2019 beliefs, who want to improve the country and love it \u2013 even though that devotion is rarely reciprocated. I\u2019ve been thinking a lot about the above quote recently. And, ahead of the Fourth of July holiday, I\u2019ve also been wondering about the political machinations that have long been used to define who\u2019s a real American \u2013 worthy of political participation \u2013 and who isn\u2019t. A simple logic governs this politics of exclusion: cruelty. \u201cMost people think of cruelty as an individual problem. And that\u2019s true because all human beings are capable of cruelty,\u201d explained the journalist Adam Serwer, who\u2019s the author of the essential new book, \u201cThe Cruelty Is the Point: The Past, Present and Future of Trump\u2019s America.\u201d \u201cBut cruelty is also a part of politics, demonizing particular groups so that you can justify denying them their basic rights and excluding them from the political process.\u201d Cruelty has been a central component of US politics for centuries \u2013 from slavery to the Redeemers\u2019 violent opposition to Reconstruction to Jim Crow to the aftermath of the 2013 Shelby County v. Holder decision. I recently spoke with Serwer about his book and its exploration of some of the most important issues of our time. The following conversation has been lightly edited for length and clarity. You\u2019ve popularized the defining slogan of an age. Why do you think that \u201cthe cruelty is the point\u201d has resonated so deeply with so many people? I think that the column I wrote popularized the phrase because it articulated in a concise way something that we were all feeling when we watched Trump rallies \u2013 including the people who enjoyed the rallies \u2013 which is that the people at these rallies really have a lot of fun when Trump is attacking the people they don\u2019t like. That ritual of public humiliation didn\u2019t merely diminish Trump\u2019s enemies \u2013 it also forged a kind of community, a bond, between Trump and his audience. As I write in the column, this is a part of human nature. When we\u2019re children, the cool kids tease the nerds, and that\u2019s what makes the cool kids cool and the nerdy kids nerdy. It reminds everybody of their place and draws boundaries. It also forges a strange kind of intimacy, separating the people who are acting in a cruel fashion from the people who are being acted upon. I think that what was distinct about the Trump era \u2013 though not unique in American politics by any means \u2013 was that Trump did all that in an unabashed and unrestrained way, where previous more mainstream Republican politicians weren\u2019t willing to do it until he showed them that it wouldn\u2019t cost them with their own voters. Ahead of the Fourth of July, some Republican politicians are railing against the newly nationally recognized Juneteenth National Independence Day. They make the stunning claim that recognizing or interrogating the dark currents of US history is unpatriotic and even dangerous. Where does this apocalyptic thinking come from? I think that the nature of Republican Party politics in the Trump era is incentivized by the structure of our political system, which substantially increases the influence of the most conservative elements of the polity. And those elements tend to be White. In 2016 and 2015, Trump is essentially repeating back to conservative audiences what he\u2019s consuming on Fox News. And what he\u2019s consuming on Fox News is sort of 24 hours of trying to convince conservative White people that their way of life is in danger, that their entire existence is at risk of imminent destruction because of what liberals or Democrats or people of color are doing. Our political system incentivizes this because the structure of our system allows one party to hold power without winning a majority of the votes. So, it becomes more urgent to persuade that group that they\u2019re on the verge of destruction and anything they do to prevent that destruction is justified. That\u2019s how you end up with attempts to disenfranchise rival constituencies, Muslim bans and laws attacking trans children or justifying vehicular homicide against protesters. The only way to alter this, really, is to alter the system so that the Republican Party has to reach out beyond its traditional base. Republican leaders are pursuing a logical but amoral strategy of scaring their base to death with things that don\u2019t exist. In one of your essays from 2016, you use Redemption \u2013 the racist backlash to Reconstruction \u2013 as an analytical frame to explore Trump\u2019s election to the White House in 2016. Are we seeing similar backlash dynamics in the aftermath of the 2020 presidential election, with the violent January 6 insurrection and GOP-led voter suppression efforts that disproportionately disadvantage voters of color? I think when you look at Trump\u2019s election in 2016, it\u2019s clear that his rise was a response to the election of Barack Obama. In 2020, what you saw was more of a backlash to a racial reckoning that began prior to Trump but was accelerated because of his presence. The protests in Ferguson drew attention to the way that American public policy continues to create racial disparities and discriminate against Black Americans. That awakening happened when we had a Black president. I think that a number of Americans wanted to reexamine: How could this be? It seemed like an archaic kind of unfreedom that didn\u2019t really belong in the Obama era. And then Trump came along and radicalized a number of people because he was such a manifestation of these political, historical and structural trends that had led to this glaring racial inequality despite the presence of a Black president. I think that the restrictions on voting rights are part of a general trend in the Republican Party toward attempting to curtail the influence of Democratic-leaning constituencies. What\u2019s really scary about this is that it\u2019s essentially an attempt to insulate Republican Party power from the electorate. Public feedback is necessary for democracy to function. If politicians can get elected without regard for what the public thinks of them, then they have no reason to hew to the public\u2019s preferences or respect their rights. Obviously, part of the point of representative democracy is that your representatives don\u2019t always do exactly what\u2019s popular. They do what\u2019s right. But what\u2019s distinct here is that Republicans are attempting to prevent American citizens from selecting their own leadership because of who they are. Most people think of cruelty as an individual problem. And that\u2019s true because all human beings are capable of cruelty. But cruelty is also a part of politics, demonizing particular groups so that you can justify denying them their basic rights and excluding them from the political process.",

            "article_content": "Excerpts from three upcoming books revealed previously unknown efforts by then-President Donald Trump to abuse the powers of his office to overturn the 2020 election, deploy the military against racial justice protests and prosecute his political opponents. The excerpts also shed new light on Trump\u2019s increasingly unstable mindset in his final year. They portrayed a president who was obsessed with self-serving conspiracy theories and surrounded by aides who knew he was delusional but were too afraid to tell him the truth. Here\u2019s a breakdown of the latest bombshells from the three books. One set of revelations came from ABC News reporter Jonathan Karl and his book \u201cBetrayal,\u201d which comes out in November. Early excerpts were published in The Atlantic, with details of Trump\u2019s unyielding attempts to have the Justice Department join his election subversion efforts. Then-Attorney General William Barr was one of Trump\u2019s staunchest allies, but he broke with Trump regarding the legitimacy of the 2020 election. Barr turned into a fact-checker of sorts, personally looking into some of Trump\u2019s pet voter fraud theories, only to quickly debunk them as baseless. (Barr did this even though he often pushed similarly dubious claims before Election Day.) Barr details break with Trump on election fraud claims in new book Everything came to a head on December 1, when Trump summoned Barr to the Oval Office. According to the book, one of the attendees said a red-faced Trump had \u201cthe eyes and mannerism of a madman,\u201d ranted and shouted at Barr, and even started banging on the desk. Trump went beyond the election and started hammering Barr for not prosecuting President Joe Biden\u2019s son or former FBI Director James Comey \u2013 two of Trump\u2019s most vilified political targets. The book bolsters recent reports about emails sent to top Justice Department officials by Trump (through his assistant) and Trump\u2019s chief of staff, cajoling them to hunt for voter fraud. Trump responded to the excerpt by attacking Barr and doubling down on his false claims of voter fraud. Weeks after Trump\u2019s meltdown with Barr, his efforts to overturn the 2020 election results came crashing down when a massive mob of his supporters stormed the US Capitol on January 6. A new book from controversial journalist Michael Wolff includes details of what unfolded inside the White House while the Capitol was overrun. The book, \u201cLandslide: The Final Days of the Trump Presidency,\u201d will be published July 27. Excerpts were published in New York magazine. Trump\u2019s senior advisers all knew Vice President Mike Pence would never go along with Trump\u2019s unconstitutional scheme to nullify the results from states that Biden won when Congress met to formally count the electoral votes. They knew Trump was experiencing \u201cderangement,\u201d but were too scared to tell him that his dreams of overturning the election were hopeless, Wolff reported. Honig: Don't buy Bill Barr's latest story about the Big Lie Instead, Trump was stuck in an fact-free feedback loop with his longtime attorney Rudy Giuliani, who led the unsuccessful effort to overturn the results at the local, state and federal level. And Giuliani led Trump even deeper into the election conspiracy theories, according to the book. The book says Trump\u2019s staff begged and pleaded with him to publicly disavow the violence at the Capitol. He waited for hours, and his daughter Ivanka Trump even allegedly said the attack was only \u201can optics issue.\u201d CNN previously reported about Trump\u2019s reluctance to call off the mob, including during a conversation that day with House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy. A new book from Wall Street Journal reporter Michael Bender describes how Trump wanted to invoke the Insurrection Act and use the military to quash social justice protests last summer, some of which descended into riots in large cities. The forthcoming book, \u201cFrankly, We Did Win This Election,\u201d is slated to be released on July 13. Axios reported some key excerpts Monday. Bender reports that there was an unprecedented shouting match in the White House Situation Room between Trump and Gen. Mark Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. Trump exaggerated the level of violence, said he wanted to deploy the military into American cities and put Milley \u201cin charge.\u201d But he was quickly rebuked by Milley, in an expletive-laced argument. \u201cGod damn it! There\u2019s a room full of lawyers here. Will someone inform him of my legal responsibilities?\u201d Milley said to the other officials in the Situation Room, according to the book. Barr then told Trump that Milley was correct \u2013 he couldn\u2019t do what Trump wanted him to do. In response to the excerpt, Trump told Axios that the argument \u201cnever happened.\u201d Bender said the incident was corroborated by \u201cmultiple senior administration officials\u201d that he interviewed.",

            "article_content": "Justice Stephen Breyer has taken a commanding role in the final days of the Supreme Court session, writing decisions preserving Obamacare and bolstering student free speech and, when conservatives ruled against union organizing on agricultural land, forcefully dissenting for the left wing. But what some liberals want to hear from the 82-year-old Breyer as the session ends in upcoming days is when he might retire. For them, the answer, reflecting the politically fraught confirmation process rather than Breyer\u2019s legal contributions, should be \u201csoon.\u201d Everyone may have to wait. No sign has emerged that Breyer would announce he is stepping down this week. That, however, may not be the end of it. Once the end-of-term pressure eases, the justice may still weigh competing considerations this summer, including his new power as the leading liberal (after last year\u2019s death of Ruth Bader Ginsburg), his view that judges should separate themselves from politics and his awareness that waiting another year could imperil President Joe Biden\u2019s choice of a successor. Supreme Court gives victory to transgender student who sued to use bathroom Breyer\u2019s vision about keeping judges above politics, expressed in a Harvard lecture in April, will be published in a book this September. The escalating turmoil of Supreme Court confirmations surely presents a dilemma for Breyer, who appears healthy and enjoys his job but is also wise to the ways of Washington. The Democrats\u2019 majority in the Senate, which has the constitutional \u201cadvice and consent\u201d power over judicial nominees, hangs by a single vote. A 1994 appointee of President Bill Clinton who served as a Senate Judiciary Committee counsel in his early career, Breyer would understand that Democrat Biden has the best chance of promptly filling any vacancy while Democrats control the Senate. He also witnessed the consequences of Ginsburg\u2019s choice to remain on the bench rather than retire when Barack Obama was president and the Senate in Democratic hands. The Biden White House has sidestepped the public debate over Breyer\u2019s possible retirement. Biden officials appear to be respecting his effort to sort out his options. They may also think that some delay of any blockbuster announcement allows them to focus on their infrastructure proposal and other legislative agenda goals. Asked Friday whether Biden hopes to see a justice retire this year, White House press secretary Jen Psaki offered no hint of the President\u2019s wishes: \u201cIt\u2019s a decision for them to make as an individual, and he still would support whatever decision they make.\u201d The Senate\u2019s one-vote Democratic majority would presumably hold at least until after the November 2022 midterm elections. So Breyer could comfortably wait until next June, when the 2021-22 session closes. But there is nothing comfortable about the message from law professors and liberal advocates who raise the specter of a single Democratic death or defection in the chamber, allowing Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell to take over as majority leader. Liberal professors and progressive organizations took out ads in The New York Times and Politico this month urging Breyer to retire soon so that Biden could name a younger liberal. Democratic Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York has been among the Democratic politicians who have said Breyer should retire. Liberals recall the bare-knuckles maneuvers of then-Majority Leader McConnell, who prevented all Senate consideration of Obama\u2019s choice of Merrick Garland for the vacancy caused by the February 2016 death of Justice Antonin Scalia. Yet in late 2020, McConnell moved quickly to fill the Ginsburg vacancy so that Trump\u2019s third appointee, Amy Coney Barrett, was in place less than six weeks after Ginsburg\u2019s death and just days before the November presidential election. The bench, which for decades had been 5-4 conservative-liberal, currently operates with a 6-3 conservative advantage. Any Biden choice of a successor to Breyer would not alter that dynamic. Liberals fear, however, political complications that would weaken their already weak hand. Breyer, a native of San Francisco, taught at Harvard law school and served as an appellate judge before his appointment 27 years ago. Until this year, he labored in the shadow of more senior liberals, including Ginsburg, a 1993 Clinton appointee. As senior member on the left, Breyer has the power to assign the opinion for that wing. In one of the most ideologically loaded cases this session, the conservative majority strengthened property rights as it rejected a California regulation that gave union organizers temporary access to agricultural land to speak to migrant farmworkers. Breyer kept the dissenting opinion for himself, arguing that the expansive approach of Chief Justice John Roberts would threaten many ordinary regulations covering the environment and public safety. John Roberts is all business in his conservatism Over the years, Breyer has helped generate cross-ideological consensus behind the scenes, notably on disputes over Obamacare, which the justices have three times voted to keep alive as Republican challengers tried to end it. In the justices\u2019 private discussions on cases, Breyer now speaks third, by seniority, after Roberts and senior conservative Justice Clarence Thomas and may have a greater chance of influencing the debate that follows. Roberts assigned Breyer two high-profile decisions issued this month. Breyer wrote for the 7-2 majority that dismissed the latest Obamacare challenge and for the 8-1 majority that enhanced student speech rights. The court sided with a cheerleader disciplined by school officials for posting a profane rant on Snapchat when she failed to make the varsity squad. The justices still have five remaining cases to decide, including disputes over Arizona voter restrictions and a California public disclosure requirement for charities\u2019 major donors. Next term, more daunting cases could reinforce the ideological divisions. The justices have agreed to resolve abortion-rights and gun-control disputes and are poised to hear a controversy over the future of university affirmative action. Breyer, who has written important opinions related to abortion rights and racial remedies, may want to remain on the bench to influence new battles. The next session begins on October 4. A few weeks before that, on September 14, Harvard University Press is scheduled to publish Breyer\u2019s book \u201cThe Authority of the Court and the Peril of Politics.\u201d Harvard University Press has been promoting the book on its website: \u201cA sitting justice reflects upon the authority of the Supreme Court \u2013 how that authority was gained and how measures to restructure the Court could undermine both the Court and the constitutional system of checks and balances that depend on it.\u201d Biden has said that when a vacancy occurs he wants to appoint an African American woman, which would be a first for the high court. One of the most prominent candidates could be Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson, whom Biden recently elevated from a US district court in Washington, DC, to the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Three of the current justices were appointed to the high court from that powerful bench, including Roberts. Ginsburg, too, had served on the DC Circuit. Jackson, it so happens, once worked for Breyer as a law clerk, providing, perhaps, yet one more factor for him to consider as he mulls future moves.

            "article_content": "The top US general repeatedly pushed back on then-President Donald Trump\u2019s argument that the military should intervene violently in order to quell the civil unrest that erupted around the country last year. Joint Chiefs Chairman Gen. Mark Milley often found he was the lone voice of opposition to those demands during heated Oval Office discussions, according to excerpts of a new book, obtained by CNN, from Wall Street Journal reporter Michael Bender. Titled \u201cFrankly, We Did Win This Election: The Inside Story of How Trump Lost,\u201d the book reveals new details about how Trump\u2019s language became increasingly violent during Oval Office meetings as protests in Seattle and Portland began to receive attention from cable new outlets. The President would highlight videos that showed law enforcement getting physical with protesters and tell his administration he wanted to see more of that behavior, the excerpts show. Top US general hits back against 'offensive' Republican criticism and defends Pentagon diversity efforts \u201cThat\u2019s how you\u2019re supposed to handle these people,\u201d Trump told his top law enforcement and military officials, according to Bender. \u201cCrack their skulls!\u201d Trump also told his team that he wanted the military to go in and \u201cbeat the f\u2013k out\u201d of the civil rights protesters, Bender writes. \u201cJust shoot them,\u201d Trump said on multiple occasions inside the Oval Office, according to the excerpts. When Milley and then-Attorney General William Barr would push back, Trump toned it down, but only slightly, Bender adds. \u201cWell, shoot them in the leg\u2014or maybe the foot,\u201d Trump said. \u201cBut be hard on them!\u201d The new details about how Milley and a handful of other senior officials were forced to confront Trump\u2019s increasingly volatile behavior during the final months of his presidency only add to an already detailed portrait of dysfunction inside the White House at that time. It also underscores the level of tension between Trump and top Pentagon officials leading up to the presidential election last November. CNN has reached out to Trump about the claims in Bender\u2019s book. A spokesperson for Milley declined to comment. Pentagon anxiety rises as officers wait for Trump's next unpredictable move At times, Milley also clashed with top White House officials who sought to encourage the then-President\u2019s behavior. During one Oval Office debate, senior Trump adviser Stephen Miller chimed in, equating the scenes unfolding on his television to those in a third-world country and claiming major American cities had been turned into war zones. \u201cThese cities are burning,\u201d Miller warned, according to the excerpts. The comment infuriated Milley, who viewed Miller as not only wrong but out of his lane, Bender writes, noting the Army general who had commanded troops in Iraq and Afghanistan spun around in his seat and pointed a finger directly at Miller. \u201cShut the f\u2013k up, Stephen,\u201d Milley snapped, according to the excerpts. CNN previously reported that concerns within the Pentagon about Trump\u2019s potential to make unpredictable decisions during the campaign and beyond reached a boiling point last September. While Milley was among those who were particularly distressed about Trump\u2019s attacks on senior Pentagon leaders, he was said to be on good terms with the President. Still, Milley made a concerted effort to stay in Washington as much as possible during those final months. A significant concern for Milley at the time was how to advise Trump if he decided to invoke the Insurrection Act in the wake of civil unrest \u2013 a move that would have military force on the streets against civilians. Ultimately, Trump never invoked the Insurrection Act but repeatedly suggested doing so during the end of his tenure \u2013 putting Milley and former Defense Secretary Mark Esper in a complicated situation each time. Both Milley and Esper were deeply opposed to the idea when Trump first suggested it last June following protests against police brutality and racial injustice in the wake of George Floyd\u2019s death. According to Bender, Milley viewed the unrest around Floyd\u2019s death as a political problem, not a military one. He told the President there were more than enough reserves in the National Guard to support law enforcement responding to the protests. Milley told him that invoking the Insurrection Act would shift responsibility for the protests from local authorities directly to the President, according to the excerpts obtained by CNN. Milley spotted President Abraham Lincoln\u2019s portrait hanging just to the right of Trump and pointed directly at it, Bender writes. \u201cThat guy had an insurrection,\u201d Milley said. \u201cWhat we have, Mr. President, is a protest.\u201d Those comments have taken on new relevance months after the January 6 attack, when pro-Trump rioters stormed the US Capitol in an attempt to stop Congress from certifying President Joe Biden\u2019s electoral win. Trump\u2019s Republican allies in Congress have staunchly opposed any efforts to investigate the former President\u2019s role in fueling the insurrection, with some simply denying there was anything violent about the protests that day. Recently, some of those same lawmakers have also criticized the Department of Defense\u2019s diversity efforts and alleged embrace of the \u201ccritical race theory.\u201d While testifying publicly before the House Armed Services Committee on Wednesday, Milley, who remains in his post as Chairman of the Joint Chiefs, offered a forceful rebuke of Republican members over their comments related to both issues. Top US general stands firm amid Pentagon turmoil Responding to a question from Rep. Mike Waltz of Florida about the appropriateness of a seminar at the United States Military Academy at West Point called \u201cUnderstanding Whiteness and White Rage,\u201d Milley said: \u201cI want to understand White rage. And I\u2019m White. And I want to understand it.\u201d Tying the question to the January 6 insurrection, Milley asked: \u201cWhat is it that caused thousands of people to assault this building and try to overturn the Constitution of the United States of America? What caused that? I want to find that out. I want to maintain an open mind here.\u201d Milley called it \u201coffensive\u201d that service members were being called \u201cquote, \u2018woke\u2019 or something else, because we\u2019re studying some theories that are out there.\u201d CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper and Michael Conte contributed reporting",

            "article_content": "A Trump supporter who spent 10 minutes inside the US Capitol during the January 6 insurrection was sentenced to probation Wednesday, avoiding jail, becoming the first rioter to learn their punishment in the riot investigation. At a hearing in DC federal court, Judge Royce Lamberth said the insurrection was a \u201cdisgrace\u201d and forcefully rebuked the \u201cutter nonsense\u201d coming from some Republican lawmakers and other right-wing figures who are whitewashing what happened. \u201cI don\u2019t know what planet they were on,\u201d Lamberth said of the GOP lawmakers, without mentioning any names. Recent releases of videos from the attack \u201cwill show the attempt of some congressman to rewrite history that these were tourists walking through the capitol is utter nonsense.\u201d Alleged Oath Keeper pleads guilty in first among major US Capitol riot conspiracy cases Anna Morgan-Lloyd, 49, from rural Indiana, had pleaded guilty to a single misdemeanor for trespassing inside the Capitol as part of the crowd on January 6. She was also assessed a $500 fine. Lamberth said Morgan-Lloyd avoided jail time because she didn\u2019t participate in the violence and condemned those who did. He issued a warning to other defendants that he\u2019ll likely sentence them to jail time if they continue defending their behavior at the Capitol. \u201cSome of these defendants are not going to do what you did. They\u2019re not going to say they did anything wrong. They, to this day, would still participate in the demonstration,\u201d Lamberth said. \u201c\u2026 I don\u2019t want to create the impression that probation is the automatic outcome here, because it\u2019s not going to be.\u201d Still, the judge said what happened on January 6 was \u201ca serious crime\u201d and a \u201cdisgrace\u201d to the country. He praised the media for its coverage of the assault and pointed out that \u201cmuch of the public remains outraged at what occurred.\u201d \u201cThis wasn\u2019t a peaceful demonstration\u2026 it wasn\u2019t an accident that it turned violent,\u201d he said. It\u2019s a benchmark moment in the massive federal probe that has ballooned to comprise nearly 500 defendants from 43 states. As the sweeping investigation approaches its six-month mark, the Justice Department has moved to resolve a few of the hundreds of federal cases. Prosecutors had secured seven guilty pleas as of Wednesday afternoon and have more scheduled for the coming weeks, giving some insight into negotiations happening behind the scenes and how dozens of defendants likely could be facing years in prison, depending on their actions during the siege. The initial set of plea deals and the sentencing are likely to serve as a warning shot as the national dragnet continues in what the Justice Department has described as one of its largest investigations ever and a major law enforcement effort to address domestic terrorism. Also Wednesday, an Oath Keeper conspiracy defendant pleaded guilty. Wednesday\u2019s sentencing for Morgan-Lloyd won\u2019t set the standard for most of the riot cases, as Lamberth noted. But hundreds of other rioters are charged with felonies for assaulting police, taking weapons to the Capitol, destroying property or \u2013 if they went into protected areas of the building \u2013 obstructing the official congressional proceedings to certify the Electoral College vote. Prosecutors so far appear to be unwilling to wipe away that level of charge. One man who went inside the Senate chamber for 15 minutes faces a recommended 15 to 21 months in prison, according to court records. Another man who allegedly posed for photos with his feet on a desk in House Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2019s office, carried a taser and stole an envelope from the office, could face nearly six years or more in prison, prosecutors have said. Morgan-Lloyd was initially accused of four federal crimes, but court filings indicate that she reached a deal with prosecutors, who recommended three years of probation, a $500 fine to cover damages to the Capitol complex and 40 hours of community service. The Justice Department laid out several factors why incarceration isn\u2019t warranted: Morgan-Lloyd didn\u2019t plan or coordinate with others before January 6; she didn\u2019t get violent during the riot; she was only in one hallway for 10 minutes; she immediately cooperated with investigators when they came knocking; she expressed strong regret; and she doesn\u2019t have any criminal record. On the day of the attack, Morgan-Lloyd posted on Facebook that it was the \u201cbest day ever,\u201d according to her court filings, but in advance of the sentencing she submitted a letter to the judge saying she had reshaped her political views since her arrest and was grappling with a family member\u2019s Holocaust denialism. She said she has spent her entire life in a \u201cvery small town\u201d in southern Indiana, which gave her a \u201csheltered life\u201d that made her out of touch with \u201cwhat life is like for others in our country.\u201d She claimed she had gone through a political transformation after her attorney urged her to learn about racial inequality by reading books and watching movies. It is common for defendants in criminal cases to tell judges before sentencing that they\u2019ve experienced changes of heart, in bids to get light punishment. Morgan-Lloyd made that case in her letter, apologized for her crimes and disavowed the rioters who had attacked police officers and trashed the building. \u201cI felt ashamed that something meant to show support for the President had turned violent,\u201d Morgan-Lloyd wrote to the judge. \u201cThis is not the way to prove any point. At first it didn\u2019t dawn on me, but later I realized that if every person like me, who wasn\u2019t violent, was removed from that crowd, the ones who were violent may have lost the nerve to do what they did. For that I am sorry and take responsibility. It was never my intent to help empower people to act violently.\u201d Fact-check: Fox News and Republican lawmakers push new false flag conspiracy that FBI orchestrated US Capitol attack After watching \u201cSchindler\u2019s List,\u201d she criticized her son-in-law for downplaying how many Jews had been killed in the Holocaust. She also said she now opposes the death penalty after reading \u201cJust Mercy,\u201d a book about wrongful convictions of Black Americans. \u201cI\u2019ve learned that even though we live in a wonderful country, things still need to improve,\u201d Morgan-Lloyd said. \u201cPeople of all colors should feel as safe as I do to walk down the street.\u201d Her lawyer, Heather Shaner, said Wednesday on CNN\u2019s \u201cNew Day\u201d that Morgan-Lloyd \u201cwas uninformed and misinformed\u201d before storming the Capitol but the book and movie assignments taught her about \u201cthe relationship between the citizen\u2019s rights and the citizen\u2019s responsibility.\u201d Other Capitol riot defendants have already pleaded guilty to similar one-count low-level charges, but because of how judges determine when sentencings can happen, Morgan-Lloyd was the first. Others, Bryan Ivey of Tennessee and a married couple, Jessica and Joshua Bustle from Virginia, also agreed to allow law enforcement to examine their social media accounts and said they would pay $500 each in restitution for damage to the Capitol by the crowd. The Justice Department has estimated the damage at $1.5 million, according to court records. Robert Reeder, a Maryland man who previously worked for the Transportation Security Administration, pleaded guilty on Wednesday to a misdemeanor charge of illegally demonstrating inside the Capitol. Even with one rioter\u2019s case closed in court, investigators are still pursuing hundreds of leads and seeking dozens of people. Also, a person caught on video leaving pipe bombs near Capitol Hill has not yet been found. Prosecutors have charged additional defendants almost every day since the attack and recently indicated in court filings they continue to pursue as many as 100 more. Republican and lifelong FBI agent debunks GOP conspiracy theory The cases, taken together, have provided more insight into the pro-Trump rioters\u2019 political inclinations, and the Justice Department has noted that the threat of right-wing rhetoric pushing ideas of election fraud and reclaiming the presidency from Joe Biden hasn\u2019t subsided. Lawyers for one defendant said he had watched six straight months of Fox News and contracted \u201cFoxitis.\u201d Another rioter, who allegedly shouted at police, \u201cYou guys like protecting pedophiles,\u201d an apparent reference to the baseless QAnon conspiracy theory, had been convicted in 2010 on a state charge of unlawful sex with a minor, and others charged with assaulting police are police themselves. Prosecutors have also continued to expand conspiracy charges against far-right extremist groups that they allege coordinated and planned to disrupt Congress\u2019 certification of the presidential vote. More than 50 defendants have been linked to far-right extremist groups, and at least two groups of alleged conspirators are accused of finding contacts online, then discussing how they\u2019d travel cross-country with firearms for the event.

Efforts to update the way Americans vote in local elections were met in New York with some grousing, while efforts to streamline the way Americans vote in federal elections were blocked in Washington. In the US Senate, it was a show vote that fell along party lines on a step that would technically have opened debate on the issue of voting rights. The irony of the filibuster, a delaying tactic meant to keep debate going as long as necessary, is that in today\u2019s Washington it functionally means there\u2019s no real debate on much of anything on the Senate floor. So we have not the world\u2019s greatest deliberative body but rather a great barricade to major legislation, which is exactly what Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell wants. Fact check: A look at four false claims about Democrats' big elections bill \u201cThe Senate is only an obstacle when the policy is flawed and the process is rotten,\u201d he said, pledging a GOP united against the voting rights legislation. \u201cAnd that\u2019s exactly why this body exists. Today, the Senate\u2019s going to fulfill our founding purpose, stop the partisan power grab.\u201d The legislation would have done a great many things with the intention of making it easier and more streamlined for more Americans to vote, which is also the opposite of the current GOP platform. Fact check: Breaking down 10 claims about the Democrats\u2019 elections bill While Democrats want more national standards in voting, Republicans are working hard at the state level to make it ever so slightly more difficult, hoping to lop off enough votes at the margins to take back the House and Senate in 2022. There is one simple reason Republicans can use majorities in state legislatures to curb voting access while Democrats can\u2019t use their majorities in Washington to open it up. And that reason is the filibuster, which does not exist at the state level in the ironclad form that has locked up the Senate. Somewhere in the middle of all of this is Sen. Joe Manchin, the conservative Democrat from very red West Virginia. He wants the parties to come together and debate, and this show vote \u2013 proving the parties won\u2019t work together on a key issue \u2013 could have been a moment of conversion for him. Why Democrats were desperate to win Joe Manchin's vote for an already-doomed election bill A Manchin-style compromise would probably strike most Americans as pretty fair. According to CNN\u2019s report, he\u2019s \u201csaid he\u2019s open to backing several of the provisions in the so-called For the People Act, including declaring Election Day a public holiday, expanding early voting to at least 15 consecutive days and banning partisan gerrymandering.\u201d All things Democrats like. But he\u2019s also approving of a GOP priority: \u201cIn return for his crucial support, Manchin wants to require identification to vote, which many progressives view as discriminatory toward racial minorities but which Republicans see as essential to deterring potential voter fraud.\u201d Who needs a voice? Washington, DC, Mayor Muriel Bowser got into a heated exchange on Capitol Hill with Republican Sen. Ron Johnson, who sits on the Senate Homeland Security Committee, on the issue of DC statehood, which most Democrats support but also has zero chance of becoming law. Obama slams GOP's opposition to voting reform Johnson argued statehood is unnecessary for DC residents, because \u201cIn the end, people choose to live here\u201d and \u201cindividuals who are within the District obviously have a vested interest in a very powerful federal government, which is counter to the power vested in the states.\u201d Bowser countered: \u201cSeven hundred thousand people \u2013 hardworking individuals who educate their children, start businesses and work in the District. \u2026 It would be incorrect to say that DC residents have more of an interest in the federal government than other Americans.\u201d What voters want. Most Americans \u2013 71% \u2013 want easier access to earlier voting, which is what Democrats are pushing. Even more Americans \u2013 80% \u2013 support requiring an ID to vote, which Republicans could do in this legislation if they bought in. Manchin has a point that lawmakers should work together for good legislation that people support. He\u2019s among the few people who think they\u2019re capable of doing it in the current environment. Change can be confusing. New Yorkers, from the news reports I saw, seemed a little flummoxed by their new ranked choice voting Democratic primary. What\u2019s ranked choice voting? Here\u2019s an in-depth explainer. In short, a voter selects a top choice and then ranks other candidates in order of preference. If nobody gets 50% on the first round of counting, the bottom vote-getters are taken out of the counting and second choices for those candidates are added in. The process repeats until one candidate gets 50%. Good-government groups argue that it cuts down on spoilers and surprises and lets people prioritize. New York City will be the largest US jurisdiction to use the system, which is already in place in a number of smaller liberal cities and in the state of Maine, which has a population a fraction the size of New York City\u2019s. It\u2019s an interesting thought experiment to wonder if Donald Trump in 2016 (or Joe Biden in 2020, for that matter) would have won their respective primaries in a ranked choice voting environment. Crowded primaries rarely result in a winner who gets a majority of the vote. Current New York Mayor Bill de Blasio got just over 40% in 2013, for instance. That primary would have required the counting of second choices. What else? Watch the Manhattan DA race. That could be the person who prosecutes Trump or his business associates.",

            "article_content": "The beginning of the end of New York City\u2019s long primary season is here, as voters go to the polls on Tuesday to decide who will steer the city through its post-pandemic recovery and confront a rise in violent crime. Up and down the ballot, in races for mayor, comptroller, five borough presidencies, dozens of open city council seats and district attorney jobs in Manhattan and Brooklyn, New Yorkers are poised to send a signal that resonates beyond the city limits \u2013 to Democrats across the country looking to its broad and diverse electorate for a glimpse into the future of the party. The contest for the Democratic mayoral nomination, which will almost certainly determine outgoing Mayor Bill de Blasio\u2019s successor, features 13 candidates, but has in recent weeks appeared to come down to four favorites: Brooklyn Borough President Eric Adams, a retired captain in the New York Police Department; former 2020 presidential candidate Andrew Yang; Maya Wiley, a civil rights lawyer who served as counsel to de Blasio in his first term; and former sanitation commissioner Kathryn Garcia. Adams, who has run on a law-and-order message mixed with a commitment to police reform, is believed by many to be the frontrunner going into primary day, but a combination of sparse polling and the introduction of ranked-choice voting means the outcome is still very much in doubt. Yang appeared to sag as the race dragged on, following a buoyant entry in which he dominated the headlines and overshadowed the lesser known hopefuls. But that early advantage also invited intense scrutiny and persistent questions over his lack of experience. Rising crime in New York has gripped the mayoral race. Eric Adams says he alone can fix it. The desire for a steady, trained hand helped key Garcia\u2019s rise \u2013 which got a massive boost when the New York Times editorial board endorsed her six weeks ago. She is known, from years in government, as a sharp technocrat with deep knowledge of the city and the levers that make it work. Her eleventh hour alliance with Yang \u2013 they campaigned together over the weekend and on Monday, with Yang calling on his supporters to rank her second on their ballots \u2013 could help broaden her appeal. (Garcia has not quite returned the favor, saying her ballot was private and refusing to explicitly encourage her own supporters to rank Yang.) Wiley represents progressives\u2019 best hope to retain the keys to City Hall. The left spent most of the campaign split among her, New York City Comptroller Scott Stringer and former nonprofit executive Dianne Morales. But after Stringer was accused twice of sexual harassment in alleged incidents from two and three decades ago (he has denied both charges) and Morales\u2019 campaign stumbled amid a staff mutiny, movement leaders ultimately consolidated behind Wiley, who has promised to shave the police budget and beef up social services. The mayoral contest has laid bare fault lines familiar to Democratic campaigns across the country and in Washington, DC, where the party \u2013 a fractious coalition even on its best days \u2013 is still negotiating its message and policy priorities during a period of dramatic economic, social and racial upheaval. Here are five major storylines to watch as early results come in on Tuesday night. The implementation of ranked-choice voting means that the one certainty on primary day is that New Yorkers will have to wait \u2013 for weeks \u2013 before most of the biggest races are decided. At some point after the polls close on Tuesday night, the city\u2019s Board of Elections will release the first-choice numbers from early and in-person voting. But that will only provide a narrow view of the results. Absentee ballots will not be counted until July 6 and the ranked-choice process doesn\u2019t kick off until June 29. Under the new system, voters are being given the option to rank five candidates. Once the ballots are in, the candidate with the lowest number of votes will be removed from the running and their voters\u2019 second choices reapportioned. The first candidate to cross the 50% threshold wins. The general consensus among close observers of the campaign and some top operatives is that the eventual winner of the mayoral primary will likely need to clock in above 20% in the initial, election night tally. The same calculus suggests that a lead with anything less than around 35% could easily disappear once the ranked-choice culling begins. Adams and Yang have waged the most fierce, personal campaign-within-a-campaign of the primary. Adams led the charge of criticism after Yang revealed, early in the running, that he spent some of the worst of the pandemic in a second home outside the city, in upstate Ulster County. Yes, Andrew Yang could be New York City's next mayor So it was little surprise that Yang laid into Adams when a controversy over whether the Brooklyn Borough president actually lived in the borough he runs blew up late in the campaign. Adams tried to defuse the questions by offering the media guided tours of an apartment he owns in Brooklyn\u2019s Bedford-Stuyvesant neighborhood, but the episode touched off a barrage of new reporting over Adams\u2019 real estate disclosures \u2013 or, in certain cases, a lack thereof. It\u2019s hard to say whether the issue swayed any voters, but its brief capture underscored unresolved issues \u2013 about home and loyalty in a pandemic-leveled city \u2013 attached to the trauma of the past 15 months and, more narrowly, the bad blood between the two candidates. That dynamic blew up over the weekend, when Yang and Garcia began to campaign together, with Yang encouraging his supporters to rank Garcia second. Surrogates for Adams charged that the alliance was forged out of a desire to keep a Black or Latino candidate out of City Hall. Though Adams has been less explicit himself in making the allegation, his campaign bundled remarks to that effect from prominent supporters and blasted them out to reporters. New York City's chaotic mayoral campaign is jolted by a late twist In an appearance Monday morning on CNN\u2019s New Day, Adams first denied that he was suggesting the alliance was racially motivated before doubling back. \u201cI can say this, that African-Americans are very clear on voter suppression,\u201d Adams said, channeling his supporters\u2019 gripes. \u201cWe know about a poll tax, we know about the fight that we\u2019ve had historically.\u201d That comment appeared to draw in Wiley, who put out a sharp statement later in the morning. \u201cAt a time when this country is seeing real voter suppression laws being enacted, using racism charges to undermine confidence in Ranked Choice Voting is cynical, self-interested and dangerous,\u201d said Wiley, who is also Black. Wiley went on to criticize Yang over comments he made at a recent debate about the mentally ill, which many considered insensitive or offensive, but ultimately argued that his campaigning with Garcia \u201cis not racist and we should not be using this term so loosely against other candidates at the end of a long campaign when New Yorkers are all coming together to make important choices about our collective future.\u201d Garcia and Yang, who both dismissed the allegation as ridiculous, continued to appear together on the stump right up through the eve of the election. It took longer than she might have hoped, but leading progressive lawmakers and organizations ultimately coalesced around the civil rights lawyer in the final weeks of the campaign. Wiley goes into primary day with endorsements from New York Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Jamaal Bowman, state Sens. Alessandra Biaggi and Julia Salazar, and New York City Public Advocate Jumaane Williams, among others, along with the Working Families Party and a long list of grassroots progressive activist groups. National liberal leaders like Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and former Housing and Urban Development Secretary Juli\u00e1n Castro, who campaigned with Wiley last week, are also onboard. The question now: Did it all come together too late in the game? The left is split and searching for a path in topsy-turvy New York mayoral race Ocasio-Cortez threw in for Wiley on June 5, one week before the start of early voting. Williams came out for Wiley days later. He explained his decision in plain, pragmatic terms soon after at a WFP-sponsored rally. \u201cOne of the reasons I decided to endorse is because the conversation is getting too crazy around public safety,\u201d Williams said in a rebuke of Adams and Yang, who have advocated for stepped-up policing. \u201cAnd we started feeding the fears that have allowed the worst things to happen to the same communities over and over.\u201d The late progressive surge undoubtedly provided a sense of momentum \u2013 or \u201cMayamentum\u201d \u2013 to Wiley\u2019s campaign, but the long and often tortured process made clear the left\u2019s rising power in city and state politics is no given and that New York, though painted in some of the deepest blues on the US electoral map, is more politically diverse and complicated than many out-of-towners realize. Longtime Manhattan District Attorney Cyrus Vance Jr., who is on his way out of the office, is expected to leave quite a job to his successor: prosecuting a case against either former President Donald Trump, the Trump Organization or its executives. No decision has been made yet, but if Vance goes ahead, it will likely fall to the winner of Tuesday\u2019s primary to follow through. The leading candidates have mostly made clear that they would relish the opportunity. The NY race that could determine Trump's fate Alvin Bragg has often noted that he sued the Trump administration more than 100 times during his time as chief deputy in the state attorney general\u2019s office. And Lucy Lang, who has worked in the Manhattan D.A.\u2019s office, has said the office should have pressed forward with a different investigation into the Trump Organization, which was not pursued. The eight-person field also includes Tali Farhadian Weinstein, the Hillary Clinton-endorsed former counsel to then-Attorney General Eric Holder. Farhadian Weinstein has been more circumspect when discussing her plans for Trump, calling it improper to comment on an ongoing probe. She has been less shy about spending her own money on the race \u2013 Farhadian Weinstein tapped into her personal reserves to inject more than $8 million into her campaign in the closing stretch of the campaign. While victory for Wiley would represent a stunning comeback story, the story is much different down the ballot. Thanks to a new term-limits law coming into effect this year, there are more than 30 open seats \u2013 out of 51 in all \u2013 to be filled on the City Council. The activist left, led by the local chapter of the Democratic Socialists of America, steered clear of the mayoral primary, in part because none of the candidates energized its members and, perhaps more importantly, it saw an unusual opportunity to gain influence \u2013 while expending fewer resources \u2013 in shaping the city\u2019s legislative body. Tiffany Cab\u00e1n, the former public defender who came within a few votes of winning the 2019 Democratic primary for district attorney in Queens, is now the favorite in her council race. She could be joined by five other DSA-backed candidates. In the comptroller primary, City Councilman Brad Lander \u2013 no DSA member, but a longtime progressive champion \u2013 has promised to bring transformative change to the job. If there is a true test of progressive power among the citywide races, the comptroller contest might be it. The contest, more than the mayoral primary, will also provide clearer insight into the influence of leaders like Ocasio-Cortez, who backed Lander early on, vigorously campaigned for him and appeared in his commercials.

            "article_content": "America is heading into a best of times, worst of times summer as the longed-for promise of deliverance from Covid-19 is tempered by spasms of violent crime, economic false starts and unexpected obstacles on the road to freedom. Things are demonstrably better. A 300 million vaccine effort gave many their lives back and a once-apocalyptic jobs crisis is much improved. A new presidency has restored science to its rightful place. The more than 600,000 dead are honored, not ignored. And the most important antidote in a national crisis \u2013 truth \u2013 has made a White House comeback. But hopes of a sudden transition to a new and carefree \u201cRoaring 20s\u201d are elusive. It\u2019s becoming clear that a shock-and-awe pandemic changed society in unanticipated ways that may take many years to play out. An emerging scenario, for instance, of a nation divided by Covid \u2013 between vaccinated Democratic states and skeptical and sickened conservative bastions \u2013 is deepening an already bitter political estrangement. The America that is slowly regaining its vigor is not the same as the one that went away in March 2020. The omnipresent polarity has worsened and exemplifies the gap between the huge expectations stirred by the long-cherished prospect of reopening and the reality of a complicated return to normality. While Washington has been fixated by former President Donald Trump\u2019s undimmed assault on democracy and the audacious debut of the Biden presidency, the rest of the country has had more immediate concerns. The joy of family reunions, delayed weddings, the urge to travel and traffic returning to clog city freeways speak to a national reawakening that has seen infections and deaths shrink since early in the year. But such rituals have coincided with the jarring return of another quintessentially American rite: the mass shooting, 10 each on the last two weekends alone. Cities like San Francisco and New York are recalling their dangerous after dark reputations of the past. And questions are being raised over whether the pent-up frustration of months of social distancing and consequential mental health issues are combining in a fatal mix with a nation awash in firearms. As states have lifted Covid-19 restrictions and the weather warmed, many US cities were hit by a sudden spike in gun crime, violence and homicides. Mass shootings have proliferated from Oregon to Louisiana and from Utah to Michigan. Last weekend, there were 10 mass shootings across nine states that killed seven people and injured at least 45 others, according to data compiled by CNN and Gunviolencearchive.org. There have been 293 mass shootings \u2013 defined by an incident in which four or more people are shot \u2013 so far this year. President Joe Biden has scheduled a speech on rising crime and violence on Wednesday, in a striking acknowledgment of the problem and a sign that White House understands the political peril of any prolonged crime spree and the opportunity it would afford for Republicans in the run-up to midterm elections. \u201cThere\u2019s been, actually, a rise in crime over the last five years, but really the last 18 months,\u201d White House press secretary Jen Psaki said Monday. Police chiefs around the nation fear a summer crime wave. Emergency rooms filled with desperately ill Covid-19 patients a year ago are now treating the victims of the nation\u2019s other epidemic \u2013 gun crime. In New York City, shootings increased by 73% in the last month compared to May 2020. In Atlanta last week, a worker at a retail store was shot and killed in a dispute over a face mask. Air rage incidents have erupted as passengers relearn the many frustrations of airline travel that are even more onerous in the world of Covid. The national homicide rate is still well short of levels seen in the 1990s. And all data at this point is somewhat anecdotal given the short control period. But some police chiefs feel they are now confronting the possibility that a confluence of factors \u2013 including economic deprivation, psychological strain, booming gun sales and constrained budgets in some political jurisdictions following a racial awakening after the murder of George Floyd \u2013 are joining to create a self-sustaining momentum of violence and unrest. \u201cWe have seen the data change, peoples\u2019 state of mind change, ever since the Covid pandemic has presented so many challenges from the economic hardship, the stress, the anxiety,\u201d Chief Murphy Paul, of the Baton Rouge Police Department in Louisiana, told CNN \u201cNewsroom\u201d on Monday. \u201cWe have to deal with the causes of crime and not just arrest our way of this,\u201d Murphy told CNN\u2019s Alisyn Camerota. A sense of uncertainty is also infiltrating the economy. Leaders of the government\u2019s financial regulation agencies told Biden on Monday that the financial system is in robust systemic condition. Brian Deese, director of the National Economic Council, told CNN\u2019s \u201cNew Day\u201d that \u201cjobs are growing and wages are going up as well.\u201d The centerpiece of Biden\u2019s proposed economic plan is to \u201cbuild back better\u201d by providing affordable housing, expanding home and health care for elderly and sick Americans and to free up more workers by improving childcare. But the economy is also experiencing unique post-pandemic factors not seen after previous economic crises. Vaccinated diners flocking to finally reopened restaurants sometimes find there aren\u2019t enough waiters and line chefs to serve them. Some staff have moved on. Others rely on government unemployment benefits that pay nearly as well as the grind. Millions of Americans are taking to the skies, but a shortage of pilots, maintenance issues with newly recommissioned airliners and even severe weather are straining the aviation network to breaking point. American Airlines just canceled hundreds of flights through July. Key indicators show the economy is on a roll and optimism is high \u2013 jobs openings are way up, the S&P index is up 14% this year, banks are thriving and the housing market is red hot. But the off-ramp to the pandemic seems to have deepened existing inequalities. The huge boom in demand and supply chain woes caused by interrupted global trade routes are exacerbating fears of an inflation spike. The economy has also changed. Many workers are still at home \u2013 and some may never want to return after 16 months online. That will have huge implications for city public transport systems and service economies. In another sign of the kind of economic transformation that is always traumatic for those involved, Washington Prime Group \u2013 a major owner of malls in 100 locations \u2013 filed for bankruptcy on Monday. The firm was hammered by the loss of rents and sales from shops that were forced to close for over a year. This all came with phalanxes of Amazon trucks rolling out into suburbs across the country day after day. The Biden White House has made conspicuous efforts to stress the improvement in American life since the President took office, after Trump\u2019s year of denial and mismanagement of the pandemic disasters \u2013 a message that will be at the center of the Democrats\u2019 midterm election campaign. But the emerging societal strains and problems in a rocky reopening are a reminder of the dizzying succession of challenges and shocks that batter every administration, and sooner or later end up on the President\u2019s desk. The hospitality and hotel industries are \u2013 like the airlines \u2013 experiencing a sharp turn from famine to feast and are finding it is not set up to cope with the sudden shift. \u201cFor 15 months we were trying to find guests anywhere we could,\u201d Chip Rogers, president and CEO of the American Hotel and Lodging Association, told CNN International on Monday. \u201cAnd now that the guests are back, leisure travel is really doing well, we can\u2019t find employees in many critical places. This has been a huge, huge challenge for us.\u201d Rogers said many workers laid off during the pandemic had found jobs elsewhere. Others are still riding out extended unemployment benefits. And even when the industry manages to fill its roster of front desk, staff, housekeepers and others, it will still face challenges, Rogers said. Without the return of white-collar business trips, the industry will never regain its pre-Covid strength. There is a fear that in the age of Zoom, convention travel won\u2019t be the same, a reality that would have grave implications for the economy. It is hardly surprising that the worst domestic crisis since World War II has had far-reaching societal consequences. Past health crises, like plague epidemics in Europe and the 1918 influenza pandemic, triggered political change, unrest and widened already existing fault lines in society. More recently, the effect of the late 2000s financial crisis took years to play out in political terms in chain reactions that helped lead to populist uprisings like the Trump presidency and Britain\u2019s vote to leave the European Union. This crisis is far deeper and affected every single American \u2013 through bereavement, illness, the loss of education or the psychological ordeal of separation and confinement. The path to recovery will be filled with impediments that are not yet obvious. And the America that emerges on the other side remains a work in progress.",

            "article_content": "Lawmakers will resume a slate of tense negotiations this week over voting rights, infrastructure and police reform as President Joe Biden\u2019s agenda enters an important week on Capitol Hill. Looming large over the deliberations is the July 4 recess in the Senate, which begins at the end of the week and could encourage real momentum just as easily as it could disrupt it. Here\u2019s where things stand on Capitol Hill: The Senate on Tuesday is set to vote on whether to advance the so-called For the People Act, a sweeping elections bill that currently lacks Republican support. But Democrats are looking to the vote as a chance to showcase unified support within their party and create a clear contrast with Republicans over the issue of voting access in America. As a result, all eyes are on Sen. Joe Manchin.   Last week, the West Virginia Democrat left open the option that he could support a modified bill after previously opposing the drafted legislation. He said he\u2019s open to backing several of the provisions in the For the People Act, including declaring Election Day a public holiday, expanding early voting to at least 15 consecutive days and banning partisan gerrymandering. But in return for his crucial support, Manchin wants to require identification to vote, which many progressives view as discriminatory toward racial minorities, but which Republicans see as essential to deterring potential voter fraud. Still, Sen. Bernie Sanders, who said he likes the House-passed HR 1, signaled openness to Manchin\u2019s proposed changes. \u201cSounds like I\u2019m open to doing everything I possibly can to protect American democracy,\u201d Sanders, an independent from Vermont who caucuses with the Democrats, said when pressed by CNN\u2019s Dana Bash on \u201cState of the Union\u201d if he supports Manchin\u2019s proposal. The compromise effort was also praised by voting rights champion Stacey Abrams. But even if enough Democrats rally around Manchin\u2019s counter proposal, he has long said that he believes any changes of this magnitude must also have the backing of Republicans \u2013 an exceedingly unlikely prospect. GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham made that much clear on \u201cFox News Sunday,\u201d calling the For the People Act \u201cthe biggest power grab in the history of the country\u201d and Manchin\u2019s proposal still too ambitious. \u201cWell, one, I like Joe Manchin a lot, but we had the largest turnout in the history of the United States and states are in charge of voting in America. So I don\u2019t like the idea of taking the power to redistrict away from state legislators. You\u2019re having people move from red \u2013 blue states to red states,\u201d the South Carolina Republican said. \u201cUnder this proposal, you would have some kind of commission, redraw the new districts, and I don\u2019t like that. I want states where people are moving to have control over how to allocate new congressional seats.\u201d \u201cSo, as much as I like Joe Manchin, the answer would be no,\u201d he added. The sweeping For the People Act, which was passed by the House in March, would bar states from limiting voting by mail, would require prepaid postage on absentee ballots and would mandate voter registration on the same day as the election. It also effectively would overturn voter ID laws by requiring states to allow voters to submit sworn statements in lieu of identification. Negotiations over the legislation come as 14 states have already enacted at least 22 new laws restricting voting this year, according to the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University. And more Republican-controlled state legislatures have joined the march to limit access to the ballot box, motivated by former President Donald Trump\u2019s unfounded claims that voter fraud contributed to his White House loss in 2020. Most of the new laws make it harder to vote absentee and by mail, after a record number of Americans voted by mail in November. Democrats for weeks have pursued two tracks in negotiations over President Joe Biden\u2019s infrastructure proposal \u2013 a bipartisan route and a more partisan route that would potentially allow them to pass a bill with only Democratic votes through a budget process known as reconciliation. White House officials view this week as crucial in their efforts to secure a bipartisan agreement and they entered Monday with a level of optimism something can get done, sources say. It\u2019s expected that President Joe Biden will make this the centerpoint of his week. There will be calls. There will likely be an Oval Office meeting. The biggest caveat being they defer to Democratic negotiators on what will or won\u2019t be helpful. The White House is largely aligned with the bipartisan proposal on the spending side, but are still searching for the right mix of potential ways to pay for it. White House staff has been drafting technical language in an effort to assist the Democratic members of the bipartisan group in bridging the gap on the issue, the sources say. White House officials view the indexing of the gas tax as out of the talks, even as Senate Republicans do not \u2013 for the moment. That could become an issue, but the reality is White House officials know there are Republicans opposed to the issue and think they\u2019re on solid ground getting out in front of the talks. Tax enforcement has really become the central pay-for White House officials are focused on \u2013 and notably White House officials aren\u2019t concerned about how that scores from a pay-for perspective. They know their estimates are likely high, but they\u2019re still willing to use them. If an agreement is reached at some point in the next two weeks, White House officials want a vote on it before the August recess \u2013 an admittedly tight turnaround. Biden is confident if a deal is reached he can find a way to quell the concerns of the left. But White House officials know one of the ways to do that will be some sort of promise from Democratic Sens. Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona that they\u2019ll be good to go on the reconciliation package down the road. So far neither has been willing to give that assurance. White House officials know Biden will need to play a major role in locking that in. Champions of each have grown louder in recent days alongside an urgency to make some progress.   Sanders on Sunday said it\u2019s urgent that Democrats work toward an infrastructure package with a larger price tag that addresses climate change and other related issues. \u201cI sometimes think we get boggled down in numbers and that\u2019s important, but we\u2019ve got to look at what the needs are of the American people, what\u2019s going on right now,\u201d he told CNN. Asked if he had Biden\u2019s blessing to push a separate $6 trillion reconciliation plan, Sanders said the President provided a \u201cserious and comprehensive blueprint.\u201d But some moderate Democrats, including Manchin and Sen. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, are squeamish about the large price tag of Sanders\u2019 plan and some have indicated they would not support it. A bipartisan group of 58 moderate House members proposed a $1.25 trillion infrastructure package earlier this month. The bill proposes $761.8 billion in new infrastructure spending over eight years, but Republicans and Democrats in both the House and Senate are still negotiating over how to pay for the new spending. White House officials are at the very, very early stages on the reconciliation package. They don\u2019t have a timeline on it (though the general idea is late September, early October) and know it\u2019s going to be an arduous and politically fraught process. They\u2019re letting House and Senate leadership lead the way on that for the moment as they stay involved from afar. They have their priorities, as already laid out by Biden\u2019s Jobs and Families plan. They expect they\u2019ll be included. But they aren\u2019t taking any hardlines at the moment. Democratic Rep. Josh Gottheimer of New Jersey and Republican Rep. Brian Fitzpatrick of Pennsylvania, co-chairs of the Problem Solvers Caucus, in a joint interview on Sunday, expressed optimism for the bipartisan infrastructure proposal while also acknowledging some members of Congress won\u2019t support the package. \u201cThis is about physical infrastructure and something that\u2019s urgent that needs to get done and we\u2019ve got bipartisan support for it. \u2026 I believe we can get this done,\u201d Gottheimer said. \u201cYou\u2019re always going to have some that disagree, but this is what this is about, just continuing to work at it.\u201d Fitzpatrick, meanwhile, said the negotiators should consider all possibilities to pay for the bill, including an increase to the gas tax \u2013 something the White House has refused to support. \u201cShould everything be on the table? Of course it should be, because that\u2019s part of compromise,\u201d Fitzpatrick said. \u201cNobody will be totally in love with the plan but everybody will be okay with it.\u201d What\u2019s clear is that where Biden comes down will matter, something Graham suggested in his Fox News interview as he implored Biden to take leadership on the infrastructure package. \u201cI think the difference between this negotiation and the earlier negotiation is we\u2019re willing to add more money to infrastructure in this package, and I am hopeful that if the White House and Joe Biden stay involved, we can get there,\u201d he said.  \u201cI would just say this, \u2018President Biden, if you want an infrastructure bill of a trillion dollars, it is there for the taking. You just need to get involved and lead.\u2019 \u201c Republican Sen. Tim Scott told reporters last month it\u2019s \u201cJune or bust\u201d when it comes to the bipartisan effort to craft a legislative overhaul of policing. That leaves just a small window for Scott and the other two lead negotiators \u2013 Democratic Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey and Democratic Rep. Karen Bass of California \u2013 to strike a deal that will satisfy both parties. Negotiations to this point have been defined by a cycle of promising momentum before long holdups as the group works to combine the Democrats\u2019 House-passed George Floyd Justice in Policing Act with the Senate Republicans\u2019 JUSTICE Act. Booker said earlier this month there\u2019s \u201ca lot of work to be done\u201d but maintained that the parties can still reach an agreement by the end of the month. \u201cI think we are days, but that could be 30 days or 25 days, who knows, and there\u2019s a lot of work to be done in a very short period of time,\u201d the New Jersey Democrat told reporters, when asked whether the negotiators are days away or far from reaching a deal. One of the thorniest issues has been \u201cqualified immunity,\u201d a controversial federal doctrine that protects officers accused of violating the Constitution while on duty. Established by the Supreme Court in 1967, qualified immunity effectively protects state and local officials, including police officers, from personal liability unless they are determined to have violated what the court defines as an individual\u2019s \u201cclearly established statutory or constitutional rights.\u201d The doctrine can be used only in civil cases, not criminal, and allows victims to sue officials for damages only under those circumstances. In April, Scott floated a compromise that would shift the burden of responsibility from individual police officers to their employers: police departments. He said at the time the idea of allowing police departments to be taken to court but not individual officers \u201cseems to be resonating\u201d in his talks with both Democrats and Republicans. \u201cI assume my conference understands where I am, and I\u2019m hopeful and optimistic\u201d about their support, Scott said of the other 49 Senate Republicans. But as recently as this month, Scott described stark differences over qualified immunity amongst the negotiators. While Biden has said he supports the George Floyd act, some leaders say if Congress won\u2019t act, they want to see the White House reviving Obama-era panels to review policing practices and investigating police agencies in more cities. Other civil rights activists, however, say the nation needs police reform legislation more than anything and they are hopeful that Congress will pass it and Biden will sign it.

            "article_content": "Sen. Bernie Sanders on Sunday signaled openness to West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin\u2019s proposed changes to sweeping elections overhaul legislation being debated in Congress. \u201cSounds like I\u2019m open to doing everything I possibly can to protect American democracy,\u201d Sanders, an independent from Vermont who caucuses with the Democrats, said when pressed by CNN\u2019s Dana Bash on \u201cState of the Union\u201d if he supports Manchin\u2019s proposal. \u201cWe\u2019re going to do the best \u2026 I like what the House passed, HR 1.\u201d Sanders told Bash he considers the House bill a \u201cserious, comprehensive effort to protect American democracy,\u201d adding: \u201cWe will see what evolves here in the Senate.\u201d READ: Manchin's list of proposed changes for S1 elections bill The Senate is set to vote on whether to advance the voting legislation, the so-called For the People Act, in its current form that lacks Republican support and falls short of the 60 votes needed to pass. Last week, Manchin left open the option that he could support a modified bill after previously opposing the drafted legislation. He said he\u2019s open to backing several of the provisions in the For the People Act, including declaring Election Day a public holiday, expanding early voting to at least 15 consecutive days and banning partisan gerrymandering. But in return for his crucial support, Manchin wants to require identification to vote that includes a utility bill as an alternative. Many progressives view the requirement as discriminatory toward racial minorities but Republicans see it as essential to deterring potential voter fraud. The compromise effort was endorsed by voting rights champion Stacey Abrams. Manchin has long said that he believes any changes of this magnitude must also have the backing of Republicans. In trying to woo Republicans to back a compromise effort, he held a teleconference call with several GOP senators \u2013 though the prospects of winning 60 votes in the 50-50 Senate are extremely dire. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell criticized the plan and indicated that Republicans wouldn\u2019t support the proposal.

            "article_content": "Legislation moved quickly through Congress this week to establish June 19 as Juneteenth National Independence Day, a US federal holiday commemorating the end of slavery in the United States. The bill overwhelmingly passed the House on Wednesday after the Senate unanimously passed the legislation on Tuesday. But at the same time, key legislation aimed at countering racial inequity and discriminatory policies faces major obstacles on Capitol Hill. A number of stumbling blocks have complicated efforts to strike a bipartisan deal on policing legislation after George Floyd\u2019s death in police custody in 2020 sparked nationwide calls to overhaul policing and address police misconduct and racial injustice. Democrats also face a divide within their ranks and stiff GOP opposition to a sweeping voting and elections bill they have made a signature agenda item and argue is needed to counter state-level Republican efforts to restrict voting access. The Democrat-led House of Representatives passed legislation in March aimed at preventing police misconduct that Democrats named in honor of George Floyd. But there is not yet a clear path forward over the issue in the Senate, where police overhaul legislation would need at least 10 Republican votes to pass. A bipartisan group of lawmakers, led by GOP Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina, Democratic Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey and Rep. Karen Bass of California, has been in talks for months in an effort to find consensus between the two parties and strike a deal that could pass in the Senate. The group has reported progress along the way, but a deal still has yet to materialize and it is not clear if the effort will succeed or stall out. Bipartisan talks have recently been hung up on a key issue: Whether Congress should include new standards for when officers can be charged with crimes. Democrats have proposed adding new crimes for which officers can be charged, something they argue will increase officer accountability. Scott and Republicans remain steadfast that any change to Section 242 \u2013 the standard for criminally prosecuting police officers \u2013 is a red line, so any addition of new crimes would have to exist outside of that provision. Scott said on Thursday that he is open to \u201ccontinuing the conversation\u201d about adding specific additional crimes outside excessive force for which police officers can be charged, a new development in the ongoing negotiations. Sen. Lindsey Graham, the other South Carolina Republican, said this week they were open to adding crimes like sexual assault. \u201cI think there is an important consideration that needs to be had about improving the confidence that the communities have to law enforcement\u2019s response and when you see areas that are easily identifiable, should you solve those issues, the answer is you should,\u201d Scott told CNN. The issue is separate from another sticking point: Whether to change the so-called qualified immunity standard to make it easier to sue officers in civil court. Despite the issues negotiators still must resolve, the lawmakers have sounded optimistic about the prospect that they will get a deal sometime this month. \u201cI\u2019m still optimistic this is the month that it has to happen,\u201d Scott said. \u201cI do still think we can wrap things up this month,\u201d Bass said. \u201cAnd if we have to go into July a little bit, we go into July, but there\u2019s no reason for this to last until the August recess.\u201d Efforts by Democrats to enact voting overhaul legislation face multiple hurdles in Congress, specifically in the Senate. President Joe Biden has urged Democrats to pass the For the People Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act to protect voting access and roll back discriminatory moves against minority voters. But Democrats do not have the 60 votes necessary to pass either piece of legislation in the Senate, the threshold needed to overcome a legislative filibuster. Republican senators have widely panned the For the People Act, a sweeping bill that Democrats say will expand voting access and counter efforts to restrict the right to vote at the state level. Republicans, on the other hand, call the legislation a partisan power grab and a federal overreach into state voting and election systems. Democrats have faced internal divisions over the For the People Act with West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin saying earlier this month that he would not vote for the bill, and arguing that any major voting legislation must be enacted on a bipartisan basis. In response, Senate Democrats have engaged in a quiet courtship of Manchin in an attempt to garner unified party support for the legislation. On Wednesday, Manchin left open the option that he could support a modified bill. Former Georgia gubernatorial candidate and voting rights advocate Stacey Abrams on Thursday praised Manchin\u2019s proposed changes, a notable statement of support from someone who is widely seen as a leader among progressives on the issue. \u201cWhat Sen. Manchin is putting forward are some basic building blocks that we need to ensure that democracy is accessible, no matter your geography,\u201d Abrams, a Democrat and strong advocate for voting rights, said on CNN\u2019s \u201cNew Day.\u201d Manchin is trying to more narrowly tailor the bill so that it is pared back and focused on compromise. The West Virginia Democrat on Wednesday released a proposal that would make Election Day a holiday, ban partisan gerrymandering, mandate at least 15 consecutive days of early voting and institute a voter ID requirement. A test vote on the voting bill is expected to take place next Tuesday, and Democrats are scrambling to try to get Manchin\u2019s support before then so that they can put up a unified front against Republican opposition to the measure. It\u2019s not yet clear if that will happen, however. The vote would be to break a filibuster to open debate and would require the support of 60 senators, which it does not currently have. But even if Manchin were to back the legislation, it is still virtually guaranteed to lack the GOP support to pass in the Senate. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell made that clear on Thursday by throwing cold water on Manchin\u2019s revised proposal and indicating that he did not believe any Republican in the Senate would vote for it. \u201cThere\u2019s now a debate among Democrats over a revised version produced by one of the Democrats yesterday which has been endorsed by Stacey Abrams,\u201d McConnell said. He went on to call the proposal, \u201cEqually unacceptable. Totally inappropriate,\u201d and said, \u201cAll Republicans, I think, will oppose that as well.\u201d The John Lewis voting rights legislation has garnered some bipartisan support, but has still not picked up the votes to pass in the Senate, where Democrats control the narrowest possible majority with a 50-50 partisan split. Republicans have largely dismissed the need for the legislation to restore a key part of the landmark Voting Rights Act. This story has been updated with additional developments Friday.

Asked if she could accept Manchin\u2019s compromise even if a voter ID mandate is part of it, the Georgia Democrat wouldn\u2019t explicitly endorse Manchin\u2019s proposal but she didn\u2019t reject it, either. \u201cWhat has been problematic is the type of restrictive ID that we\u2019ve seen pop up,\u201d she said. \u201cOur point is simply that the restrictions on the forms of ID should meet the needs of the people. And what he is proposing makes sense because it says what we\u2019ve had in this country for so many decades which is that people can prove their identity in various ways but we should not narrow the playing field so much that we push voters out of participation simply because of restrictions that make no sense and do not increase security.\u201d She added, \u201cThis is a first and important step to preserving our democracy.\u201d A voter ID requirement in order to cast a ballot has been viewed by many progressives as discriminatory toward racial minorities, though Republicans have said it is essential to deter voter fraud. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer is planning to move the For the People Act in its current form for votes next week despite Manchin\u2019s opposition. Manchin told CNN on Thursday that he\u2019s undecided on whether he will vote to take up the voting bill, saying he is trying to win over GOP support for his proposal. He also said voter ID is not a red line for him and would not say if Schumer should delay next week\u2019s vote. \u201cThat\u2019s going to be Leader Schumer\u2019s decision to make on that,\u201d he said, adding that he has been talking with Abrams. \u201cI\u2019ve been working across the aisle with all the Republicans trying to get people to understand that that\u2019s the bedrock of our democracy, an accessible, fair, and basically secured voting. That\u2019s it. And right now, in a divided country, it\u2019s not about me, it\u2019s about our country.\u201d Senate Majority Whip Duck Durbin of Illinois told reporters Thursday that he has concerns about what Manchin suggests leaving out of the voting rights bill. \u201cWhat he excludes is troublesome, worrisome,\u201d Durbin said. He also said he believes that it\u2019s important to put a voting rights bill on the floor even though there is no evidence Republicans would support it, adding \u201cmembers need to be on the record.\u201d New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, a Democrat, on Wednesday expressed dissatisfaction with Manchin\u2019s proposed changes to the voting rights bill, specifically drawing issue the requirement for voter ID. \u201cI mean I\u2019m not supportive of voter ID especially nationally and to impose that, I know New Yorkers don\u2019t want that either,\u201d Ocasio-Cortez told CNN.

            "article_content": "This week, voting right activists Cliff Albright and LaTosha Brown will board a 53-foot bus and kick off a tour through the South. Their task: Rally public support for federal legislation to combat the raft of new state laws aimed at restricting voting rights. They face big obstacles. Among them: Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, a centrist who is a key vote in a 50-50 Senate and has opposed a sweeping voting rights bill, in its current form, that the Senate is slated to consider this month. He also has resisted changing Senate rules to allow Democrats to pass legislation by a simple majority, a position that could doom another measure that would restore some voter protections first enshrined in the 1965 Voting Rights Act. But hard jobs are the specialty of these two friends who co-founded Black Voters Matter Fund five years ago to increase political power in African American communities. In 2017, they mobilized voters in Alabama to help Doug Jones become the first Democrat elected to the US Senate in that deep-red state in a quarter century. And in 2020, they were among the Georgia-based activists who helped turn the state blue and elect Joe Biden to the presidency. They helped repeat that feat this year with the runoffs wins of Democratic Sens. Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock in Georgia, giving the party a slim majority in the Senate with Vice President Kamala Harris empowered to break tie votes on some measures. Black turnout in the special election surged, helping drive the Democratic victories. The duo have paid a high price for their activism, however. They\u2019ve faced threats to their safety on the road and back at home in the Atlanta area. On January 5, the day Ossoff and Warnock won their elections, Brown got a call from the FBI, she said, warning her to stay alert for suspicious activity. She said she soon learned the organization\u2019s name was on a list of potential targets devised by a far-right group. So instead of celebrating the Democratic takeover of Washington, Brown and Albright fled their homes \u2013 spending the days following the special election in temporary housing. \u201cNormally, after you secure a victory, there\u2019s some reprieve,\u201d Brown told CNN in a recent interview. \u201cBut we got punished for being successful.\u201d Still, Brown and Albright say that little could deter them from their latest campaign to confront the glut of new laws in Republican-controlled states that limit ballot access. \u201cWhat other choice do I have?\u201d Brown asked. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing these attacks because we are gaining ground, not because we are losing. This isn\u2019t the moment to get dejected and pull back. We have to keep our eyes on the prize.\u201d At least 22 new laws restricting voting had been enacted in 14 states as of May 14 \u2013 beating a record of 19 such laws in 2011, according to the Brennan Center for Justice. They range from provisions that make absentee voting harder to those that empower partisan poll watchers. Black Voters Matters\u2019 latest mobilization campaign, dubbed the Freedom Ride for Voting Rights, starts Saturday on Juneteenth \u2013 the holiday commemorating the day in 1865 that enslaved residents of Galveston, Texas, learned of their emancipation. The nine-city tour comes 60 years after the original Freedom Rides through the South, the bus trips that Black and White activists took together to protest the bus terminals that remained stubbornly segregated despite a 1960 Supreme Court ruling deeming the practice unconstitutional.   The Black Voters Matter tour is part of a broad effort by voting rights groups and Democrats to fight the new restrictions \u2013 with lawsuits, pressure campaigns on lawmakers and voter registration drives aimed at flooding competitive states with new voters likely to back Democrats in next year\u2019s midterm elections. The Texas Democratic Party, for instance, is spending $1.7 million this year on a pilot project that aims to register 2 million likely Democratic voters in the Lone Star State before the 2022 elections, said Luke Warford, the state party\u2019s chief strategy officer. Nationally, the Democrats\u2019 Senate campaign committee this week said it would spend $10 million on new voter protection programs in Senate battlegrounds. Fair Fight Action, the voting rights group founded by former Georgia gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams, recently launched an advocacy campaign called \u201cHot Call Summer\u201d to rally young voters of color to support the For the People Act.  Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer has pledged a test vote this month on the far-reaching elections and campaign finance overhaul. And a coalition of some 70 groups, including Indivisible and Common Cause, has announced a Deadline for Democracy campaign to urge the Senate to pass the bill by August. For Albright and Brown, the tour is a homecoming in many ways. It will begin with stops in Jackson, Mississippi, and Birmingham, Alabama \u2013 the state in which they began their work together. Brown, 50, grew up mostly in Selma, Alabama. Albright, a New Yorker whose activism began when he was an undergraduate at Cornell, followed his wife, April England-Albright, to Selma in the late 1990s, where he became steeped in the city\u2019s living civil rights history. He co-hosted a radio show with J.L. Chesnut, Selma\u2019s first Black lawyer and a pivotal, if lesser-known, figure in the city\u2019s voting rights struggles. One of the first joint projects between Albright and Brown involved offering Black history and leadership training to middle school students in the city. They also worked on an independent campaign in 2000 that helped elect Selma\u2019s first Black mayor and ousted Joe Smitherman, whose tenure as mayor of the majority Black city dated to 1965 \u2013 the year that civil rights icon John Lewis and other activists were beaten on the Edmund Pettus Bridge on Bloody Sunday. The brutality unleashed by the sheriff\u2019s posse and state troopers that day helped spur Congress to pass the original Voting Rights Act. Albright, 51, said a key principle guides their political work: Black voters matter everywhere, including in the Southern states that Democratic political operatives had long written off as Republican strongholds. They work mainly in 11 states: Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, Georgia, Florida, Tennessee, Texas, South Carolina, North Carolina, Michigan and Pennsylvania. They partner with groups on the ground, directing money and other assistance to grassroots organizations that have track records in communities. In 2018, for instance, Black Voters Matter collaborated with organizations in Tennessee to pass a referendum that established a civilian board to oversee the Nashville Police Department. They provided grant money to the groups gathering signatures to put the measure on the ballot, but \u201csome of it was just giving us moral support,\u201d said Sekou Franklin, a political scientist at Middle Tennessee State University and an activist who worked on the Nashville policing effort. \u201cLetting us know that we were on the right side was a big deal for us,\u201d he added. Steve Phillips, a longtime Democratic donor who has worked with Brown for more than a decade, said the group plays a \u201ccritical role\u201d because they \u201care strategically focused on the places that have the greatest untapped potential.\u201d The organization has a combined $27.2 million budget this year between its two nonprofit arms. A recent tax return shows the organization dispensing modest sums \u2013 $6,000 or $8,000 at a time \u2013 to church groups, voting rights organizations and nonprofit child care centers operating in the often-overlooked communities they try to reach. Black Voters Matter also is known for its big, motor-coach tour buses. They serve as traveling office space and mobile advertisements of their activism. Albright and Brown roll into towns, dispensing T-shirts, registering voters and urging their followers to text voting messages to their friends and families. They get very hands-on, too. When voting snarled in heavily African American counties during a Georgia primary last year, Albright joined other activists at a polling place, providing snacks and encouragement to voters who had waited until nearly midnight to cast their ballots. (That practice is outlawed by Georgia\u2019s new voting law, which makes it a misdemeanor to provide food or water to voters waiting in line. The group has sued to stop the law\u2019s implementation, one of at least seven lawsuits challenging Georgia\u2019s new voting rules.) And wherever the Black Voters Matter\u2019s bus shows up, music follows. Brown, a soulful alto who\u2019s developing a one-woman show of freedom songs, often belts out a few bars of the civil rights anthem \u201cKeep Your Eyes on the Prize\u201d to open her talks. \u201cSometimes I have to sing to soothe my own soul,\u201d said the mother of two. Sometimes, though, they and their bus \u2013 emblazoned with their logos and messages of Black empowerment \u2013 receive unwanted attention. Last fall, about 15 minutes after the bus dropped off their group at an Airbnb rental in Cleveland, a neighbor began knocking frantically on the front door, Albright recalled. A trash can next to the house had been set ablaze, in what he believes was an act of vandalism, targeting their group. They both took seriously the FBI warning this year on the day of the Georgia runoffs. The organization paid for private security, and Albright moved with his wife and two of their three sons to a short-term rental for about eight days, he said. \u201cAnytime the FBI calls you, you know something\u2019s up,\u201d said Albright. An FBI official in Washington declined to comment when asked about the bureau\u2019s January 5 warning. This month\u2019s bus tour will wend through the South with stops in cities such as Nashville, Atlanta and Columbia, South Carolina. It will include a visit to Manchin\u2019s home state of West Virginia. Manchin, the only Democrat holding statewide office in a state Donald Trump won by 39 points last year, has proposed changes to the broad voting rights measure in hopes of winning some Republican support. He\u2019s not the only hurdle that voting rights advocates must overcome. Other Democrats have had reservations about the sweeping For the People Act, with its Christmas tree of provisions that include public financing for congressional elections, limits on partisan gerrymandering and ethics rules for Supreme Court justices. And only one Republican, Sen. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, had publicly endorsed, as of Wednesday, another voting rights bill supported by Manchin. That measure, the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act, seeks to restore and could expand a key provision of the original Voting Rights Act: a requirement that states with histories of racial discrimination obtain federal permission, or \u201cpreclearance,\u201d before changing their voting laws. Currently, it takes 60 votes \u2013 which, under the Senate\u2019s current makeup, requires the support of 10 Republicans \u2013 to advance most legislation in that chamber without dismantling the Senate\u2019s filibuster rule. If Congress fails to provide a federal backstop against the new voting restrictions, it will fall to Black Voters Matter and other activists to continue their fight, Albright said. \u201cWe believe we will outwork and out-organize them and find ways to overcome voter suppression,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s been the history of our experience with voting in this country \u2013 having to overcome those barriers.\u201d \u201cBut at the end of the day, we shouldn\u2019t have to make history,\u201d he said.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Editor\u2019s note: This story originally published on June 1 and has been updated to reflect the remaining cases left in the term. The Supreme Court is staring at its self-imposed end of June deadline, but with only weeks to go the justices have not yet released some of the most significant opinions of the term, including a challenge to the Affordable Care Act, the Voting Rights Act and a case on religious liberty involving a Philadelphia foster agency. Recent weeks have seen justices clear their desks of those opinions that produce fewer divisions, as the tension grows for the big-ticket cases. Nothing Justice Stephen Breyer has said publicly suggests he's ready to quit At the same time, eyes are on any retirement plans of Justice Stephen Breyer, 82. His departure would allow President Joe Biden and Senate Democrats to replace him with a much younger liberal. Justices have often announced their retirements at the end of a term. RELATED: The art of persuasion: How past presidents have tried to nudge Supreme Court justices off the bench Here\u2019s what the court has on its docket: Republican-led states \u2013 aided by the former Trump administration \u2013 are trying to get the court to invalidate the entire Affordable Care Act, former President Barack Obama\u2019s most significant legislative achievement. The case marks the third time the court heard a significant challenge to the 2010 law, although the stakes are heightened given the implications of Covid-19, the catastrophic deaths and the current burdens facing the health care industry. As things stand, Texas and other Republican-led states are challenging the law and California and other Democratic-led states, the House of Representatives and the Biden administration support the law. In one of his first acts as president, Biden informed the court that his government was reversing the position taken by the Trump administration. The Department of Justice now argues that even if the individual mandate is constitutional and that even if the court finds otherwise, it should sever the mandate and allow every other provision to stand. Obamacare sign-ups hit 1.2 million in special enrollment period, but pace starts to slow At issue is a major dispute pitting claims of religious liberty against the LGBTQ community. It comes as the new conservative majority has moved aggressively to protect rights under the Free Exercise Clause of the Constitution. In the case heard in early November, Philadelphia froze the contract of a Catholic foster agency because the agency refused to work with same sex couples as potential foster parents. The agency, Catholic Social Services, sued under the First Amendment. Philadelphia defended its action, saying the agency violated anti-discrimination laws that are neutral and applicable to everyone. Supporters of LGBTQ rights support the city, arguing it was within its rights to freeze the contract to an organization receiving taxpayer funds and turning away same sex couples. They fear that a decision in favor of CSS would clear the way for religious organizations to get exemptions from non-discrimination laws in other contexts. Supporters of expanding religious liberty rights hope the court\u2019s conservative majority, expanding upon a trend from last term, will continue to hold the government to a higher standard when it comes to regulations that impact religious believers. The Supreme Court is considering two provisions of Arizona law that the Democratic National Committee says violate the historic Voting Rights Act that prohibits laws that result in racial discrimination. One part of the state law requires that in-person Election Day voters cast their votes in their assigned precinct. Another provision says that only certain persons \u2013 family, caregivers, mail carriers and elections officials \u2013 may deliver another person\u2019s completed ballot to the polling place. A short history of the long conservative assault on Black voting power Eight years ago, Chief Justice John Roberts wrote the 5-4 majority opinion in Shelby County v. Holder, effectively gutting Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act, a provision that required states with a history of discrimination to obtain the permission of the federal government or the courts before enacting new laws related to voting. Since that decision, challengers to voting restrictions have increasingly turned to Section 2 of the law, that holds that no voting regulation can be imposed that \u201cresults in a denial or abridgment of the right of any citizen of the United States to vote on account of race or color.\u201d Democrats fear the new conservative majority on the court will now weaken Section 2. The case comes as Republican state legislators across the country are also moving at a fast clip to pass laws to restrict voting access. The justices are considering a case about when a police officer needs a warrant to enter the sanctity of an individual\u2019s home. In general, in such circumstances a warrant is required, although the Supreme Court has held that under certain exigent circumstances, a warrant is not required. If, for example, an officer is in \u201chot pursuit\u201d of a driver or if emergency aid is needed a warrant is not always necessary. The case at hand explores whether a categorical exception to a warrant holds up if the officer thinks the person he is following in \u201chot pursuit\u201d committed a less serious offense: a misdemeanor. It\u2019s the first time the justices have looked at the scope of the \u201chot pursuit\u201d doctrine when it comes to a minor violation. The case offers the Supreme Court the opportunity \u2013 for the first time in decades \u2013 to examine the relationship between NCAA spending limits and student athletes who are seeking compensation for their talents. At issue is a lower court ruling that struck down spending caps for \u201ceducation related benefits\u201d because, the court held, they violated antitrust laws. The NCAA is asking the Supreme Court to reverse the decision arguing that it is going to allow money to pour into the system under the guise of \u201ceducation\u201d which will destroy the distinction between amateur and pro sports. A lawyer for a class of students said the lower court got it right, and worried about the exploitation of students. The Supreme Court is again considering the power of union organizers in a case that pits agriculture businesses and privacy rights advocates against big labor and raises questions of when the government can allow access to private property without compensation. A ruling against the union position in the case would come after the Supreme Court in 2018 dealt a blow to the funding of public-sector unions. The case is brought by agricultural growers challenging a California state law that allows union organizers onto their property to speak to workers unannounced. They say it amounts to a government \u201ctaking\u201d of the land without just compensation. The Biden administration is supporting the union\u2019s position, a change from the Trump administration, which had backed the employers. Conservative non-profits Americans for Prosperity (a Koch-affiliated group) and the Thomas More Law Center are challenging a California law that requires charitable organizations that solicit donations to disclose a list of their contributors to the state attorney general. The groups say they want to keep their donors secret and that the state has not shown a compelling reason for the law. They argue that the law will chill contributors from coming forward for fear of harassment \u2013 in violation of the First Amendment. Although the information is supposed to be confidential, the groups say that the state may make inadvertent disclosures. Justices skeptical of California nonprofit disclosure law In response, California argues that the groups already have to file the same data with the IRS and the state needs the information as it tries to combat fraud related to charities. Three other states \u2013 New York New Jersey and Hawaii \u2013 have similar laws. The case is being closely watched by those who fear it could lead to more anonymous \u201cDark Money\u201d flowing into the system. \u201cThe nonprofits are asking the Supreme Court to make it harder for the government to require the disclosure of donor information,\u201d said Lloyd Hitoshi Mayer, an expert on campaign finance at Notre Dame Law School. \u201cWhile the case is about a state Attorney General asking for this information, if the Supreme Court raised the bar here, that would likely also apply to election donor disclosure laws down the road.\u201d The justices are looking at a First Amendment case concerning the authority of public school officials to discipline students for what they say outside of school. Then-junior varsity cheerleader Brandi Levy, who didn\u2019t make the varsity squad lashed out on social media while she was off campus, writing, \u201cf\u2013k school f\u2013k softball f\u2013k cheer f\u2013k everything.\u201d The words were accompanied by a picture of her giving a middle-digit salute. After the outburst, the girl was suspended from the squad as having violated team and school rules. Lawyers for the girl sued alleging the school had violated her freedom of speech. The girl won in the lower courts that held that school could not remove her for off campus speech. According to the court of appeals, she did not \u201cwaive her First Amendment rights as a condition of joining the team.\u201d Supreme Court grapples with First Amendment rights of schoolchildren in cheerleader case Back in 1969, the Supreme Court held that public school officials could regulate speech that would \u201cmaterially and substantially interfere with the requirements of appropriate discipline in the operation of the school.\u201d But that decision concerned speech at school. \u201cEmpowering public school officials to censor what students say when they are outside of school would be an epic restriction of young people\u2019s freedom of expression,\u201d said Witold Walczak of the ACLU, defending the student. The Biden administration has weighed in in favor of the school arguing that there is some speech, that \u201cintentionally targets specific school functions\u201d that warrant discipline even if it occurs off campus.",

            "article_content": "Senate Democrats are engaged in a quiet courtship of West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin in an effort to garner unified party support for a sweeping elections overhaul bill despite the long odds that enough Republicans will ever back its passage. The hope, Democrats say, is to create a clear contrast with Republicans over the issue of voting access in America, with party leaders fearing that a Manchin defection would undercut their political argument over an issue central to their agenda. Behind the scenes, conversations have picked up steam in recent days to win over Manchin, their lone holdout, who has faced withering criticism from the left over his refusal to back the bill. On Wednesday, Manchin left open the option that he could support a modified bill after previously opposing the drafted legislation. He said he\u2019s open to backing several of the provisions in the so-called For the People Act, including declaring Election Day a public holiday, expanding early voting to at least 15 consecutive days and banning partisan gerrymandering. But in return for his crucial support, Manchin wants to require identification to vote, which many progressives view as discriminatory toward racial minorities but which Republicans see as essential to deterring potential voter fraud. Manchin, too, has tried to woo Republicans to back a compromise effort, holding a Monday teleconference call with several GOP senators even though the prospects of winning 60 votes in the 50-50 Senate are extremely dire. Manchin has long said that he believes any changes of this magnitude must also have the backing of Republicans. But on Wednesday, the West Virginia Democrat didn\u2019t go that far when asked if he\u2019d be open to a revised bill that lacked the support of the GOP. \u201cWe need a good bill that basically protects voters, protects states and protects states\u2019 rights,\u201d Manchin, a former West Virginia secretary of state, told CNN. \u201cA good voting bill has to be accessible. It has to be fair. It has to be secure.\u201d The Senate Democratic Caucus is meeting Thursday to discuss the issue further \u2013 ahead of a crucial test vote expected next week. Manchin believes that only bipartisan legislation can last in Washington, and has told others that he believes he can secure Republican support for the bill. \u201cThe right to vote is fundamental to our American democracy and protecting that right should not be about party or politics,\u201d Manchin\u2019s office said in a memo obtained by CNN. \u201cCongressional action on federal voting rights legislation must be the result of both Democrats and Republicans coming together to find a pathway forward or we risk further dividing and destroying the republic we swore to protect and defend as elected officials.\u201d But it\u2019s highly unlikely that 10 Republican senators will join Democrats in passing the bill. When the House passed its version of the legislation in March, every Republican voted against it. Manchin said, \u201cNo, I\u2019m not confident\u201d that Democratic leaders will make the changes he\u2019s proposed. \u201cI owe it to them to let them know\u201d of his proposals, Manchin said. \u201cI made the statement that I could not support the bill in its present form. I owe it to them and I\u2019ve done that.\u201d READ: Manchin's list of proposed changes for S1 elections bill Among the other changes Manchin has proposed are to require states to send absentee mail ballots to voters if they are unable to vote in person due to an \u201celigible circumstance.\u201d The West Virginia Democrat had previously pushed for his party to pass a different voting rights bill, known as the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act. That legislation would renew a part of the 1965 Voting Rights Act, which had blocked certain jurisdictions with a history of voter discrimination from changing their voting rules up until 2013, when the Supreme Court ruled the formula used by the Justice Department unconstitutional. Manchin noted the bill named after the late Georgia congressman had the support of Alaska GOP Sen. Lisa Murkowski, and floated on Wednesday proposals aimed at more Republicans, including decreasing the attorney general\u2019s authority to determine voting right violations and creating \u201cobjective measures\u201d in identifying patterns of discrimination. A handful of Senate Democrats have been working with Manchin for several weeks to try to address his concerns. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York met with other moderate Democrats on Tuesday and signaled that members should not try to pressure Manchin to support of the legislation. Virginia Democratic Sen. Tim Kaine told CNN that the goal is to get \u201c50 out of 50 Democrats\u201d; otherwise Republicans could claim there is bipartisan opposition to the bill. \u201cManchin is the person,\u201d said Kaine. \u201cHe\u2019s been real cooperative in laying out his specific concerns and we\u2019re trying to address them.\u201d \u201cLook, he was the secretary of state in West Virginia, so he knows voting issues,\u201d Kaine added. \u201cHe\u2019s never said that he would vote against a good bill.\u201d CNN\u2019s Lauren Fox, Ted Barrett and Morgan Rimmer contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Alabama pastor Ed Litton will be the next president of the Southern Baptist Convention following a narrow election win Tuesday \u2013 a victory for the more moderate establishment against a conservative insurgency in an ongoing fight within the nation\u2019s largest Protestant denomination. The vote comes as the SBC has been grappling with questions about racial reconciliation, gender roles within the clergy and how to handle sex abuse cases. Litton defeated the favored candidate of conservative Southern Baptists, Georgia pastor Mike Stone, in a runoff, receiving support from 52% of the delegates (called \u201cmessengers\u201d) to the SBC\u2019s annual meeting in Nashville. \u201cMy prayers and congratulations are with Pastor Ed Litton as Southern Baptists continue to serve our churches and our communities,\u201d said Stone in a statement Tuesday evening. The outcome was uncertain in the days and even hours before the vote, which took place at one of the largest annual meetings in SBC history. More than 13,000 messengers voted in person Tuesday, a year after the 2020 meeting was canceled due to the Covid pandemic. Southern Baptists grapple with race, gender, sex and God in pivotal annual meeting Lindsay McDonald, the wife of a pastor from Casey, Illinois, told CNN that she and her husband voted for Litton in part because of his \u201ccompassion\u201d and understanding of \u201cdifferent people groups\u201d in communicating the Gospel. But she says she expected the race to be close. \u201cComing into the convention, we believed that Mike Stone was going to be a very good contender as president,\u201d said McDonald, who has been attending SBC annual meetings for 14 years. \u201cWe were thankful that Ed Litton was the one that did win.\u201d Despite the talk of unity, Southern Baptists appeared headed for a major split over the sorts of culture-war issues usually reserved for politics, such as race and gender. The internal conflict took on a particularly Trumpian tone, pitting a populist group of self-identifying \u201creal\u201d Southern Baptists against those they say would transform the church into something unrecognizable to many traditionalists. Beyond the presidential race, the fight over the future of the SBC played out over a series of votes on hot-button issues like the use of critical race theory, which the SBC adopted as acceptable in 2019. While conservatives had hoped to see language rejecting critical race theory, the SBC\u2019s moderate wing appears to have carried the day here, too, as a resolution was passed to reaffirm the church\u2019s position on racial reconciliation and to condemn racism. \u201cIf some people were as passionate about the Gospel as they were about critical race theory, we\u2019d win this world for Christ tomorrow,\u201d said James Merritt, a pastor and former SBC president who chaired the rules committee, during the floor debate over the resolution on race. In addition, the convention passed a resolution to permanently disqualify those who commit sexual abuse from holding pastoral positions. Conservatives had sought unsuccessfully to change that language in order to allow for more local control over those decisions. The SBC, an evangelical church, is also overwhelmingly White and has become increasingly aligned with political conservatives. Like most Christian denominations in the US, the SBC faces shrinking membership \u2013 a frequent topic of discussion during the first day of the meeting, on Tuesday. But where the church\u2019s moderates have advocated a conciliatory approach on race in an attempt to attract a broader group of adherents, a conservative vanguard has coalesced to beat back what it considers an embrace of \u201cwokeness\u201d by the Southern Baptist establishment. For months, the organizing energy has been on the side of conservatives. The spirit of revolt against the church\u2019s so-called liberals has been driven largely by the work of the Conservative Baptist Network, which encouraged fellow travelers to register as messengers for Nashville. Stone, who is closely associated with the Conservative Baptist Network, was these conservatives\u2019 favored candidate. He has criticized the church leadership\u2019s adoption of a nonbinding resolution in 2019 that accepted critical race theory as a useful tool for understanding systemic racism. Stone told a Georgia congregation in March in a pitch for his candidacy that he supported passing a resolution in the upcoming meeting rejecting critical race theory. \u201cOur Lord isn\u2019t woke,\u201d Stone said in remarks first reported by the Wall Street Journal. There were plenty in attendance on Stone\u2019s side \u2013 but not enough to make a majority on most issues. During the floor debate on Tuesday afternoon, one messenger from Las Vegas rose to argue for amending a resolution condemning racism to also reject the use of critical race theory. \u201cTwo years ago, we approved CRT [critical race theory] as a teaching tool and now we need to address it by its name and this resolution doesn\u2019t do so,\u201d the messenger said. \u201cIf we do not have the courage to call a skunk a skunk, let\u2019s not say anything.\u201d Despite his objection, the resolution passed without that amendment. Conservatives also objected to the tolerance by the SBC of member churches that ordained female pastors \u2013 an exceedingly rare practice in the faith. Chad Tivs, a Louisiana pastor, used the session devoted to resolutions to call out one well-known California church for this break with tradition. \u201cI move that we, the SBC, would break fellowship with Saddleback Baptist Church as they have ordained three ladies as pastors, and all other churches that would choose to follow this path. At the very least, I am asking that the validity of this matter be looked into and a report given at the 2022 convention,\u201d Tivs said. Outgoing SBC President J.D. Greear, a moderate who dutifully heard out objections and amendments and points of order from conservatives throughout the day, said Tivs should refer his motion to a separate committee \u2013 and quickly moved on.

            "article_content": "As President Joe Biden makes the case for democracy overseas, his agenda back home is facing major obstacles in Washington, where early progress on several key items has stalled in Congress. Plodding negotiations and calls to drop bipartisan overtures could imperil \u2013 or even unravel \u2013 headway on infrastructure, police reform and voting rights. And a raft of revelations about former President Donald Trump\u2019s Justice Department is threatening to draw focus on Capitol Hill elsewhere this week. Here\u2019s where things stand in Congress: The coming days will bring a better sense of where lawmakers stand on the $1.2 trillion infrastructure package that a bipartisan group of 10 senators announced last week. While the deal amounted to the most significant development yet in negotiations, the effort is already facing stiff resistance from liberal Senate Democrats eager to abandon bipartisan talks. \u201cLet\u2019s face it. It\u2019s time to move forward,\u201d Sen. Elizabeth Warren, a Massachusetts Democrat, told CNN last week about the talks with the bipartisan group. \u201cThe Republicans have held us up long enough.\u201d While the group didn\u2019t publicly reveal specifics of the agreement, several sources told CNN they crafted a package that includes: \u201cWe\u2019re focusing on the traditional infrastructure definition: roads, bridges, airports, seaports, waterways, highways, broadband, and I think that makes sense,\u201d GOP Sen. Susan Collins told CBS\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation\u201d on Sunday. But many Republicans are wary that the price tag is too high, while many Democrats prefer a much more ambitious and expensive plan that they think will boost the economy, aid the climate and create jobs. The result is a two-track path for Democrats: Party leaders say they are pursuing Biden\u2019s massive infrastructure and social safety net package along both bipartisan and partisan lanes. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer is preparing to begin the budget process next month, setting the stage for advancing a bill along straight party lines, something that can only succeed if all 50 Democrats endorse such a process known as reconciliation. Where the White House comes down on the plan will matter a lot. While many Democrats expressed concerns that their party\u2019s negotiators were giving up too much in the talks, if the President endorses the plan, it could force many to fall in line. \u201cThe President appreciates the Senators\u2019 work to advance critical investments we need to create good jobs, prepare for our clean energy future, and compete in the global economy,\u201d White House spokesman Andrew Bates said in a statement last week. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, for her part, said Sunday she\u2019s \u201cvery pleased\u201d that a deal was reached, but she warned the proposal might be a tough sell to the House Democratic Caucus if more isn\u2019t included. \u201cI do think that it is predicated on an infrastructure that is of the last century. We have to be thinking in a more forward way. We must build back better. So if this is something that can be agreed upon, I don\u2019t know how we can possibly sell it \u2026 to our caucus unless we know there is more to come,\u201d she told CNN\u2019s Dana Bash on \u201cState of the Union.\u201d Deliberations over a broad policing reform bill remain stalled on a number of key issues as negotiators race to meet their deadline for an agreement before the end of June, when a two-week July Fourth recess begins.

Tim Scott of South Carolina, the top Republican negotiator, described to CNN last week how in addition to resolving the stark differences over qualified immunity \u2013 which deals with whether individual officers could be sued for wrongdoing as Democrats want but Republicans reject \u2013 there are still challenges in combining the Democrats\u2019 House-passed George Floyd Justice in Policing Act with the Senate Republicans\u2019 JUSTICE Act. \u201cIt\u2019s a little more complicated than just the top four or five issues that we\u2019ve been covering, because the devil in the details of the actual body of the pieces of legislation are complicated and there are very big differences,\u201d he said. Asked by CNN why the talks, which have stretched on for many weeks, are taking so long, Scott said combining the two very large bills is proving to be complicated. \u201cHave you read the two bills? They\u2019re long,\u201d he said. \u201cSo, I don\u2019t mean that to be sarcastic. In all honesty, comparing the two bills, and then coming to a solution on the two sides is really hard.\u201d Sen. Cory Booker, the key Senate Democratic negotiator, agreed Thursday that there\u2019s \u201ca lot of work to be done\u201d but maintained that the parties can still reach an agreement by the end of the month. \u201cI think we are days, but that could be 30 days or 25 days, who knows, and there\u2019s a lot of work to be done in a very short period of time,\u201d the New Jersey Democrat told reporters, when asked whether the negotiators are days away or far from reaching a deal. Pressed on whether he\u2019s concerned about some progressive organizations not wanting a compromise on qualified immunity, Booker said, \u201cI\u2019m going to get the best deal we can possibly get, and if it\u2019s not making substantive and meaningful reform that will, you know, create more transparent policing, more accountable policing and potentially save lives then I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any reason to do it.\u201d Supporters of the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act say it would boost police accountability and help eradicate racial bias in policing. While Biden has said he supports the bill, some leaders say if Congress won\u2019t act, they want to see the White House reviving Obama-era panels to review policing practices and investigating police agencies in more cities. Other civil rights activists, however, say the nation needs police reform legislation more than anything and they are hopeful that Congress will pass it and Biden will sign it. While Schumer has said he will put the For the People Act (or S 1) \u2013 a sweeping election and voting rights package \u2013 on the floor this month, the legislation currently doesn\u2019t have the votes to advance. The broad package, which was passed by the House in March, would bar states from limiting voting by mail, would require prepaid postage on absentee ballots and would mandate voter registration on the same day as the election. It also effectively would overturn voter ID laws by requiring states to allow voters to submit sworn statements in lieu of identification. The bill\u2019s proponents are expected to hammer out changes to the roughly 800-page bill to make it more palatable to all members of their caucus and address the concerns of local election officials. The current version, for instance, mandates 15 consecutive days of early voting with polls open at least 10 hours a day. But Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, one of the Democrats guiding the measure through the Senate, has sought to exempt jurisdictions with fewer than 3,000 registered voters and those that mail ballots to all voters, following feedback from election officials. Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia is the only Democrat who is not a co-sponsor of the original legislation, but other Democrats have expressed concerns with the current draft of the bill in private meetings. \u201cI believe that partisan voting legislation will destroy the already weakening binds of our democracy, and for that reason, I will vote against the For the People Act. Furthermore, I will not vote to weaken or eliminate the filibuster,\u201d Manchin wrote in an op-ed published in the Charleston Gazette-Mail last week. Activists say they are preparing for a range of outcomes, including an all-out drive against the filibuster during the senators\u2019 July Fourth recess, if the bill falters in the Senate later this month. The showdown in the chamber will play out as more GOP-controlled states move ahead with limits on voting, inspired by former President Donald Trump\u2019s unfounded claims that voter fraud contributed to his White House loss in 2020. As of late last month, 14 states had enacted at least 22 laws restricting ballot access since the 2020 election, according to the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University School of Law, with an additional 61 bills advancing through legislatures in 18 states.

            "article_content": "Most presidents stop trying to define the nation\u2019s future once they leave office. But Barack Obama and Donald Trump are refusing to concede the battle for America\u2019s soul on which they first clashed more than a decade ago. No modern former commanders in chief have been so present or outspoken about politics, or each other, after returning to private life. But the 44th and 45th Presidents just renewed their battle over the country\u2019s political lifeblood \u2013 democracy \u2013 which has rarely faced a graver assault than from Trump\u2019s election fraud lies. No two individuals better exemplify the current chasm between the two halves of the country: one racially diverse and socially liberal, the other mostly White and conservative. Obama unlocked the aspirations of the first to launch his hope and change crusade and two-term presidency. Trump launched a political movement with a racist conspiracy about Obama\u2019s birthplace and used the latter group to fuel a populist backlash to the nation\u2019s first Black presidency. And even though a new President, Joe Biden, is now in office, his immediate predecessors \u2013 who revile one another but will be forever linked in history \u2013 still embody the dominant forces tearing at the nation. Obama issued his latest alarming warning that the democratic values that have prevailed for generations are in danger of failing in an interview with CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper that aired Monday evening. The former President warned the Republican Party that sought to neuter his presidency had taken a much darker turn as many of its key lawmakers now support Trump\u2019s falsehoods about non-existent electoral fraud and whitewash his role in inciting an insurrection against Congress on January 6. \u201cWe have to worry,\u201d Obama said, \u201cwhen one of our major political parties is willing to embrace a way of thinking about our democracy that would be unrecognizable and unacceptable even five years ago or a decade ago.\u201d That was some statement from a former President whose own administration was blocked at almost every turn by the GOP, and who once hoped in vain that the conservative \u201cfever would break\u201d with his reelection in 2012. The interview with Obama aired just two days after Trump unveiled his most flagrant manifestation yet of the Big Lie of a stolen election, as he took his first steps on a comeback trail with a demagogic appearance in North Carolina. \u201cI\u2019m not the one trying to undermine American democracy. I\u2019m the one that\u2019s trying to save it,\u201d Trump said, spinning a new and pernicious reality in which his millions of supporters can take refuge from the truth of the events of 2020. Multiple courts, election officials in key states and official audits established that Trump lost fair and square to Biden last November, as the ex-President\u2019s spurious suits alleging fraud fell apart. But Republican state legislators have nevertheless acted on his narrative of lies to pass a raft of electoral laws making it harder for Democrats, and especially Black Americans, to vote and to make it easier for partisan local officials to influence the outcome of future elections. The intensifying struggle over democracy coincided with several other developments that underscore the primacy of this nation defining political theme in 2021. Moderate Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia said that he would oppose a sweeping bill his party hoped to pass to counter the GOP moves. His decision, in a 50-50 Senate where the GOP can block Biden\u2019s agenda, makes it hard for his party to halt a drive many Democrats think is a bid to steal the 2024 election. Biden meanwhile is preparing to depart for Europe on his first foreign trip since moving into the White House. He plans to rally Western democracies against the tide of autocracy powered by strongmen in China and Russia. His summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin will have domestic as well as international significance given US accusations that Moscow twice interfered in US elections to help Trump, who is now trying to dismantle US democratic norms. Back in the US, meanwhile, there are new revelations of anti-democratic behavior while Trump was in office. The New York Times reported over the weekend that former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows tried to force the Justice Department to investigate absurd voting conspiracy claims. And CNN on Monday broadcast new tapes that depicted a phone call in which Trump\u2019s former lawyer Rudy Giuliani sought to pressure Ukraine to announce a probe into conspiracy theories about Biden. In other words, an operative acting on behalf of the former President offered benefits for a foreign power to interfere in an American election. There are not many clearer abuses of power. The style in which Trump and Obama are prolonging their long-distance tussle over America\u2019s future encapsulated the vastly difference experience of their presidencies that played out over the last 12 years. Obama, in a sit-down interview, was temperate and spoke in well-sculpted paragraphs. Trump delivered his new assault in a rambling 90-minute screed at a political event that previews a new round of summer swing state rallies. Still, Obama has become far more outspoken about the toxicity that he sees as taking over the Republican Party than he was in while in power. The 44th President had originally planned to stay out of politics after his two terms in office ended, but he was so alarmed by Trump\u2019s behavior that he decided to speak his mind. No modern president has ever made such strident warnings that the core of American democracy is under threat, as he did for instance during the Democratic convention last year. While Republicans argue that the former Illinois senator was hyper-political himself and did not live up to his own calls for unity, events have proven the 44th President\u2019s warnings as prescient. After all his successor denied his election loss, brought a mob to Washington that destroyed America\u2019s tradition of peaceful transfers of power and Republicans nationwide have tried to remove the guardrails that confirmed Biden\u2019s election as president. \u201cWe occupy different worlds. And it becomes that much more difficult for us to hear each other, see each other,\u201d Obama said on CNN\u2019s \u201cAnderson Cooper 360.\u201d He blamed the root causes of the country\u2019s deep divisions on economic and racial \u201cstratification\u201d and the siloing of the media that means that millions of Americans only hear news that suits their politics. \u201cWe occupy different worlds. And it becomes that much more difficult for us to hear each other, see each other,\u201d Obama told Cooper. It is clear that bitter experience and what would once have been seen as unthinkable political turmoil in modern America have scorched the worldview of the man who as a youthful Illinois Senate candidate wowed the nation with his career-making assurance that there is not a \u201cliberal America and a conservative America\u201d or a \u201cBlack America, a White America\u201d but \u201cthere is the United States of America.\u201d Trump has never subscribed to the ideal of unity Obama invoked at the 2004 Democratic National Convention in Boston. His political method weaponizes division, makes a virtue of chaos and distills grievance into power. \u201cBad, bad things are happening to us, perhaps like never before,\u201d the most recent ex-President said in North Carolina. He argued that radical leftists are destroying American freedom. \u201cThey want to silence you, they want to silence your voice,\u201d Trump told his supporters. By unveiling a Senate race endorsement for North Carolina Rep. Ted Budd \u2013 who voted not to certify Biden\u2019s election win \u2013 Trump made clear the price for his support in a party he still dominates is full fealty to his election fraud lies \u2013 and that endorsement only came after his daughter-in-law, Lara Trump, decided against running. Trump last month ordered Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky and House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy of California to kill a bill setting up a bipartisan, independent commission to probe the Capitol riot. His former national security adviser Michael Flynn recently agreed that the US needed a coup like Myanmar, an impoverished nation long suppressed by a dystopian military dictatorship where pro-democracy advocates are imprisoned, and peaceful protestors are shot and tortured. He later tried to deny he said what he said, even though it was on tape. A rare Republican with the courage to stand up to Trump, Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming, was stripped of her third-ranking GOP leadership post in the House. In an appearance on David Axelrod\u2019s \u201cAxe Files\u201d podcast, Cheney said on Saturday that Trump\u2019s incitement of the Capitol insurrection was the \u201cmost dangerous thing, the most egregious violation of an oath of office of any president in our history.\u201d Perhaps the most remarkable aspect of the autocratic transformation of the Republican Party, which once styled itself as the guardian of global democracy, is that it profits from and advances a parallel attack by Washington\u2019s former Cold War foe Russia. As well as the election interference to benefit Trump, US intelligence agencies blame Russia for a flurry of cyberattacks on US government facilities and companies.  A fresh spate of ransomware attacks on US infrastructure is also believed to originate in Russia. The degradation of US democratic standards and the corruption of the political system looks familiar to one of Obama\u2019s closest White House aides. Ben Rhodes, a former deputy national security adviser, just published a new book \u201cAfter the Fall\u201d that examines the slide into autocracy in nations like Russia and Hungary. He noted that the latter\u2019s leader, Viktor Orban, had orchestrated a right-wing populist backlash to the financial crisis, packed the courts with conservative justices and redrawn legislative districts and laws to benefit his voters. Orban also enriched cronies and weaponized a propagandistic media machine while wrapping the entire push in a nationalist bow. \u201cI\u2019m thinking this sounds like a familiar playbook, it\u2019s what I\u2019ve lived at home,\u201d Rhodes told CNN\u2019s Bianna Golodryga on CNN International on Monday, referring to Trump\u2019s 2016 campaign and presidency. \u201cOn January 6, we learned it can happen here too.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Former President Barack Obama said Republicans have been \u201ccowed into accepting\u201d a series of positions that \u201cwould be unrecognizable and unacceptable even five years ago or a decade ago,\u201d telling CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper he is worried about the state of democracy in the United States in an exclusive interview that aired Monday. Obama, in an interview that comes after his latest memoir, \u201cA Promised Land,\u201d was published in late 2020, said he never thought some of the \u201cdark spirits\u201d that began rising within the Republican Party during his tenure would get this dark and reach the epicenter of the party. \u201cWe have to worry,\u201d Obama said, \u201cwhen one of our major political parties is willing to embrace a way of thinking about our democracy that would be unrecognizable and unacceptable even five years ago or a decade ago.\u201d The clearest example of this, Obama said, was the January 6 insurrection and how there are now \u201clarge portions of an elected Congress going along with the falsehood that there were problems with the election.\u201d The insurrection at the US Capitol by Trump supporters came on the same day that 147 Republican lawmakers voted not to certify Joe Biden\u2019s electoral victory in key states. The falsehood that the 2020 presidential election was stolen has been pushed by former President Donald Trump himself, who has since cheered on baseless Republican audits of elections. Asked by Cooper about Republicans leaders briefly going against Trump following the insurrection, Obama said, \u201cAnd then poof, suddenly everybody was back in line.\u201d \u201cNow, the reason for that is because the base believed it and the base believed it because this had been told to them not just by the President, but by the media that they watch,\u201d Obama said. He later added: \u201cMy hope is that the tides will turn. But that does require each of us to understand that this experiment in democracy is not self-executing. It doesn\u2019t happen just automatically.\u201d Obama wrote at length in his memoir about how his historic election in 2008 created a wave of bitter and divisive turmoil that fueled Republicans\u2019 obstructionism and ultimately changed the party into its current iteration. Trump, Obama argues in the book, encapsulates this, because to \u201cmillions of Americans spooked by a Black man in the White House, he promised an elixir for their racial anxiety.\u201d But Obama also looked beyond Trump in the memoir, noting that the real rise of this brand of Republicanism began when Arizona Sen. John McCain, Obama\u2019s 2008 opponent, tapped then-Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin to be his running mate. \u201cThrough Palin,\u201d Obama argued in the book, \u201cit seemed as if the dark spirits that had long been lurking on the edges of the modern Republican Party\u2026 were finding their way to center stage.\u201d Obama lauded some Republicans in his interview with CNN for protecting the presidential election, notably Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, who the former president said was \u201cvery brave,\u201d despite being \u201cviciously attacked for it.\u201d Raffensperger became the target of Republican ire after he defended the election results in Georgia, which gave the state to Biden. Trump has has endorsed Raffensperger\u2019s primary challenger, Rep. Jody Hice. But some the former President\u2019s most searching commentary came when asked about the root causes to the deep divisions in the country, rifts that Obama attributed, in part, to questions about sources of information and race. \u201cWe occupy different worlds. And it becomes that much more difficult for us to hear each other, see each other,\u201d Obama said, something the former President attributed to a nationalization of both media and politics. \u201cWe have more economic stratification and segregation. You combine that with racial stratification and the siloing of the media, so you don\u2019t have just Walter Cronkite delivering the news, but you have 1,000 different venues,\u201d Obama said. \u201cAll that has contributed to that sense that we don\u2019t have anything in common.\u201d The solution, Obama said, is more face-to-face meetings where people are hearing each other\u2019s struggles and stories. \u201cThe question now becomes how do we create those venues, those meeting places for people to do that,\u201d he said. \u201cBecause right now, we don\u2019t have them and we\u2019re seeing the consequences of that.\u201d At the heart of some of these divisions, Obama argued, is race \u2013 a through line that defined Obama\u2019s rise in politics and his election as the first Black president. The former President said during the interview that it remains \u201chard for the majority\u2026 of White Americans to recognize you can be proud of this country and its traditions and its history and our forefathers and yet, it is also true that this terrible stuff happened.\u201d \u201cThe vestiges of that linger and continue,\u201d Obama said. \u201cAnd the truth is that when I tried to tell that story, oftentimes my political opponents would deliberately not only block out that story but try to exploit it for their own political gain.\u201d As he does in the memoir, Obama points to his decision to criticize the arrest of Harvard Professor Henry Louis Gates in 2009, who was detained trying to get into his own home in Cambridge, Massachusetts. Obama\u2019s comments on the arrest \u2013 \u201cThe Cambridge police acted stupidly in arresting somebody when there was already proof that they were in their own home,\u201d he said in 2009 \u2013 set off a firestorm and, according to the former President, tanked his polling with White voters. \u201cAnd it gives a sense of the degree to which these things are still\u2026 they\u2019re deep in us. And, you know, sometimes unconscious,\u201d Obama said in the interview. \u201cI also think that there are certain right wing media venues, for example, that monetize and capitalize on stoking the fear and resentment of a White population that is witnessing a change in America.\u201d While Obama jokes during the interview that he is a \u201clittle too gray-haired\u201d to get back into community organizing, his daughters \u2013 Sasha and Malia \u2013 participated in Black Lives Matter protests after George Floyd was killed in Minneapolis in 2020, giving their father a \u201cgreat source of my optimism.\u201d \u201cMy daughters are so much wiser and more sophisticated and gifted than I was at their age,\u201d Obama said with a laugh during the interview. \u201cWhen people talk about\u2026 how do I think about my legacy, you know, part of it is the kids who were raised during the eight years that I was president. There\u2019re a bunch of basic assumptions they make about what the country can and should be that I think are still sticking. They still believe it. And they\u2019re willing to work for it.\u201d Obama\u2019s interview with CNN largely centered on his participation in a so-called BAM \u2013 or Becoming a Man \u2013 circle. The program, aimed at mentoring and supporting boys and young men, started in Chicago in 2001, but Obama first joined one of the circles in 2013 and has continued to be a part of the program ever since. The program was a key reference when Obama launched My Brother\u2019s Keeper in 2014, as he worked to reverse trends showing young men of color are more likely to drop out of school, get in trouble with the law or be unemployed. During the interview, Obama also reflected on his somewhat unlikely path to the presidency, arguing that his struggles early in life were \u201csimilar\u201d to those of the young men he mentors in Chicago. Obama wrote in his memoir that he was an \u201cincessant, dedicated partyer\u201d while he was growing up and that he and his friends \u201cdidn\u2019t discuss much beyond sports, girls, music and plans for getting loaded\u201d while they were going to school. Obama has been up front about not being focused on his future at a young age, telling students at an event in 2014 that he often \u201cmade bad choices\u201d growing up. \u201cI have to be careful not to overstate. I was not, you know, going around, beating up kids and setting things on fire,\u201d he told Cooper in the CNN interview. \u201cBut I understood what it meant to not have a father in the house. I understood what it meant to be in an environment in which you were an outsider.\u201d He added, \u201cThe violence and drugs and some of the issues that the guys were dealing with day to day were different. But the mistakes I made, the struggles I was going through, were similar.\u201d Through the program, which is said to work with 8,000 youth in 140 schools each year, the former President meets for group conversations with young men in Chicago. During that time, Obama tries to convey that even though he went on to become the President of the United States, he struggled with many of the things these young men deal with on a daily basis. \u201cThe first time I sat down with these guys, the most important thing for me to communicate at that time, and I was President of the United States, was in many ways, (you) are ahead of me, of where I was at your age,\u201d Obama said. \u201cI just had certain advantages you guys don\u2019t. I could make a mistake and land on my feet.\u201d The advice is both broad and practical. During the meeting, one participant noted how he had never learned how to tie a tie or the difference between forks at a dinner. \u201cI didn\u2019t learn that \u2018til I got the White House,\u201d Obama joked in response. Obama wrote in his memoir that it wasn\u2019t until college \u2013 first at Occidental College in California and later at Columbia University in New York \u2013 that he began to develop an academic curiosity. He noted that for three years while living in New York, he \u201clived like a monk \u2013 reading, writing, filling up journals, rarely bothering with college parties or even eating hot meals.\u201d In the memoir, he wrote that he got lost in his own head about success and failure, something that has become a central question in his work with students in Becoming a Man. \u201cThese kids are just as talented. They\u2019re just as smart. They could achieve just as much,\u201d Obama said in the interview with Cooper. \u201cThe single most important thing I learned\u2026 the line between success or failure in this society so often is dictated not by anybody\u2019s inherent merits.\u201d He added, \u201cIt has to do with the circumstances in which they\u2019re in. That doesn\u2019t mean they don\u2019t have individual responsibility. \u2026 But it also means that we as a society continue to fail them.\u201d This story has been updated with additional details from the interview.",

            "article_content": "Dontaye Carter pauses to think what he would want George Floyd to know. He takes a long breath before growing emotional as he lists what he wishes he could apologize for: that Floyd\u2019s life wasn\u2019t valued, that an officer didn\u2019t think enough to \u201ctake that knee off your neck.\u201d And then there is the deep pain as Carter speaks of Floyd\u2019s daughter, and his three-year-old daughter Kyleigh. \u201cHe\u2019s not going to be here for his little girl,\u201d Carter says, with tears rolling down his face. \u201cThat\u2019s the part that hit me the hardest.\u201d Carter was one of many activists protesting in the wake of Floyd\u2019s murder in Minneapolis at the hands of police. And now a year later, Floyd\u2019s death is a big part of the reason why many activists are running for local office across the country. Carter decided to run for mayor in Sandy Springs, Georgia, after he said he grew emotionally exhausted from attending what felt like unending protests for Black people killed during police encounters and other racists attacks. \u201cEverything that you\u2019re fighting for you can change,\u201d he recalls telling himself. Videos capturing the killings of Ahmaud Arbery, a Black man shot and killed while running in a Georgia neighborhood, and George Floyd gave him something to point out the inequalities Carter knew, but perhaps others hadn\u2019t seen. This is the state of policing in America a year after George Floyd was killed For Carter, it\u2019s about more than just social justice movements. He believes his city\u2019s leadership, especially the executive office, should reflect the population. Sandy Springs is the second-largest city in the metro Atlanta area. The once predominantly White community, criticized by some for a history rooted in segregation, is now made up of more than 40% racial minorities. For Carter and other activists-turned-political candidates, making the decision to run felt like an actionable step after a year of such frustration and anger. Their runs, channeling that pain into political power, mirror the path of activists who ran for office after the death of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Missouri. Or the throngs of women who ran for office after the election of President Donald Trump. \u201cI\u2019ll be honest, that was the first time I\u2019ve ever felt like I had control over my life, like I made a decision that I control that decision from top to bottom, Carter said, describing the moment he filed paperwork to run for office. He says it was a welcome feeling after the hopelessness of watching the more than nine-minute video that captured Floyd\u2019s death. Twenty-three-year-old Chi Oss\u00e9 says he cannot shake how he felt after watching the video. \u201cIt filled me with anger, and it filled me with this passion to stand up and do something about it,\u201d Oss\u00e9 said. \u201cI wish no Black person was killed by law enforcement, but what (Floyd) started is something that\u2019s going to create some everlasting change for individuals that look like him, and look like me.\u201d Oss\u00e9 is running for a seat on the city council representing his district in Brooklyn, New York. If elected, he would become one of the youngest, and one of the first self-described queer city council members in New York City. He created a name for himself while leading marches and protests following the deaths of Floyd and Breonna Taylor, a Black woman shot and killed by police in Louisville, Kentucky. Isolation due to Covid-19 quarantine, combined with the Floyd video helped elevate the young man\u2019s push for social justice and systemic reform. \u201cI think this one hit differently because of the quarantine and isolation that I was in. You know I was unable to look away from these videos, and these images that many of us were seeing,\u201d Osse explains. LaTonya Tate is not new to the fight to make the justice system more just. As a Black woman in the South and part of a family with a history of activism, it has been ever-present. And as a retired parole officer, she knows a good deal about the justice system and its failures. In the video of Floyd\u2019s death, she saw those failures play out in agonizing detail. \u201cI wasn\u2019t taught that in our academy,\u201d Tate says. \u201cIf a threat is not there, and the person is in handcuffs, you have policies and procedures that you have to follow.\u201d She believes she can lead desperately needed and uncomfortable conversations if she is elected to the city council in Birmingham, Alabama. \u201cWe can no longer ignore what is going on. Now, we\u2019ve got to have these hard conversations whether people want to have them or not,\u201d Tate says. Tate took on criminal justice reform years before protests for Floyd took over streets across the country. After her own son was incarcerated, she experienced the justice system\u2019s complexities, and was inspired to create the Alabama Justice Initiative, a social justice group pushing to end mass incarceration. As Tate campaigns for office, she walks through Birmingham\u2019s Kelly Ingram Park, a historic gathering point, whose walkways are lined with statues dedicated to civil rights icons, including Martin Luther King Jr. The park served as a place for demonstrations in the 1960s and again for George Floyd in 2020. Those demonstrations in the 1960s, and others throughout the South, helped propel many prominent activists to move into politics, including Andrew Young, one of Martin Luther King Jr.\u2019s most trusted advisers who later became mayor of Atlanta. The late Rep. John Lewis, who survived a brutal beating by state troopers during a landmark 1965 march in Selma, Alabama, became a towering figure of the civil rights movement before being elected to Atlanta\u2019s City Council and later to Congress. Cori Bush, a Black Lives Matter activist in Ferguson, won a House seat in Missouri, becoming the state\u2019s first Black woman to represent the state in Congress. The park, and the movement it pays tribute to, reminds Tate of the history of segregation and racism, including the 16th Street Baptist Church bombing in Birmingham as well as her own family\u2019s activism in the movement. Tate is advocating for community policing. She believes in reallocating funds from police to invest in the community with mental health training, health care, education, youth programs and social services. Francois Alexandre believes that a community policing role is crucial for accountability. It\u2019s what he\u2019d like to change when it comes to law enforcement in his district in Miami if he wins a seat on the Miami City Commission. For Alexandre, 35, Floyd\u2019s murder took him back to June 2013. After the Miami Heat won the NBA championship, Alexandre found himself among a crowd gathered near his apartment. According to the police report, police received reports of the crowd overturning cars. Police formed a line in front of the crowd. Alexandre began filming on his cell phone and can be heard shouting at police as they stood in formation. As the tension escalated and police moved in, cell phone and surveillance video show an officer grab Alexandre in a chokehold. \u201cThey just started pounding on me,\u201d Alexandre says. Changes to qualified immunity in policing deal face Senate GOP resistance Alexandre says he woke up in the hospital with a bruised face, a broken eye socket and an injured shoulder. In a court order, a federal judge indicated the officers\u2019 \u201cuse of force was excessive\u201d in an order saying the case should go to trial for violating fourth amendment rights. The Miami Police Department said they would not comment on the case because of pending litigation. Alexandre says he doesn\u2019t talk about that night often. He was 27 years old then and says he was worried about getting arrested and kicked out of school. Seven years later, the video of George Floyd reignited his desire to fight for social justice. He points out he got to come home, but Floyd didn\u2019t. \u201cGeorge Floyd\u2019s life didn\u2019t have to be taken,\u201d he said. \u201cNor did I have to be beaten.\u201d Charlotte, North Carolina City Council member Braxton Winston knows the path these activists are taking well. He was the subject of an iconic photo depicting the tension between police and protesters after an officer shot and killed Keith Scott, a Black Charlotte resident in 2016. The photo captures a shirtless Winston displaying a raised fist as he faced baton-holding police officers. Shortly after, he says he decided to run for office to \u201cdisrupt the status quo\u201d and was elected in 2017. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a long history of electing Black, and brown, and women,\u201d Winston says. \u201cIt\u2019s not just good enough to get people elected, but it\u2019s learning how to use the tools of the system, to understand how to use the budget and budget processes, to learn how to understand the land use processes that control what gets developed and what doesn\u2019t. It\u2019s understanding how to ask the right questions.\u201d Winston\u2019s gained victories to defund chemical agents for crowd control, which he says led to a broader conversation about the overall role of government in ensuring public safety. He says he has learned that support and political will are essential and in ways he is not set up to succeed. \u201cThe most difficult thing is that this game is not set up for people like me to serve. It\u2019s set up so rich, wealthy older people can do it,\u201d Winston says. \u201cWhen you pay somebody $20,000 a year to do a job that you can spend every hour of the day on, then you prohibit the working person.\u201d The Black Voters Matter organization, which aims to increase power in the black community through voter outreach and advocacy, says efforts are underway to engage black voters and to build voting power. In June, the organization plans to launch a bus campaign to engage Black voters while commemorating the 60th anniversary of the Freedom Rides movement, bus tours taken by civil rights activists in the \u201960s to fight segregation in the South. While much has changed since the civil rights movement, there is still so much work to do, the activists say. Carter hopes this can be a moment where the country looks deep into its soul and reckons with its past. \u201cWe\u2019ve got work to do,\u201d he says. \u201cAnd we can\u2019t ignore the history of racism and the impact that it\u2019s had on this country. And I think it\u2019s not until we face these things, until we face these demons that we\u2019re able to make this a more equitable society.\u201d",

            "article_content": "The battle lines have been drawn in the voting rights wars as several Republican-led states consider ever restrictive laws and Democrats fight a frantic battle in courts to combat what President Joe Biden has called an \u201cassault on democracy.\u201d Now, within the next few weeks, the Supreme Court will enter the melee and weigh in on the scope of the Voting Rights Act in a way that could bolster efforts by Republicans in states like Georgia and Texas to limit access to the polls. The decision will come down in the last turbulent weeks of the court\u2019s term, and supporters of voting rights fear the new conservative 6-3 majority will pick up where the court left off eight years ago and gut another provision of the historic law. Revolt by Texas Democrats heaps pressure on Washington to act on voting reform It\u2019s the first time the justices have considered the scope of the Voting Rights Act as it applies to the denial of the vote since Chief Justice John Roberts wrote a 5-4 opinion in 2013 effectively invalidating Section 5 of the law. That section required states with a history of discrimination to obtain federal approval before making any changes to their voting laws. \u201cOur country has changed,\u201d Roberts wrote for the majority. Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg\u2019s dissent, comparing the court\u2019s action with \u201cthrowing away your umbrella in a rainstorm because you are not getting wet,\u201d led to the establishment of her persona as the \u201cNotorious RBG.\u201d Since the decision in Shelby County v. Holder, states have moved forward with new laws, an effort further fueled by former President Donald Trump\u2019s unfounded claims of widespread voter fraud in the 2020 presidential election. For their part, Democrats have turned lately to a different section of the Voting Rights Act, Section 2, which bars regulations that result in racial discrimination. It has principally been used in the past for issues such as redistricting challenges. \u201cSection 2 is one of the only tools we have left to challenge discriminatory policies,\u201d said Sean Morales-Doyle of the Brennan Center. \u201cThe wave of restrictive laws being introduced and passed in state legislatures across the country highlights once again how important it is to have a strong Voting Rights Act to protect voters.\u201d On Tuesday, President Joe Biden named Vice President Kamala Harris to lead the administration\u2019s efforts to protect voting rights. Kamala Harris to lead Biden administration's efforts on voting rights The case before the justices involves two Arizona regulations that a lower court held violated the Voting Rights Act. One is a 2016 prohibition on assisting a voter with the return of her ballot. It\u2019s a practice that civic groups in Arizona have used to help Native American voters in rural areas who do not receive postal service at their doorstep. The second is a longstanding practice of wholly discarding ballots that are cast at the wrong precinct rather than partially counting them. Arizona\u2019s out-of-precinct policy is among the strictest the nation because it discards votes for local candidates, but also for president, senators and members of the House of Representatives. The 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals invalidated both provisions, stressing the state\u2019s \u201clong history of race-based discrimination against its American Indian, Hispanic, and African American citizens\u201d and highlighting a \u201cpattern of discrimination.\u201d Obamacare, LGBTQ rights, voting laws in play during Supreme Court's final month Unlike fights against voting restrictions in Georgia and Texas, however, Democrats are divided on whether the two Arizona laws should be allowed to stand. The Democratic National Committee argues the rules should fall, but the Biden administration told the court that the laws passed legal muster. The larger fight in the case is about the standard that the court comes up with to deal with future challenges that are currently ricocheting through the lower courts. \u201cOn the surface this case is about two relatively narrow practices in one state, but it could have quite broad implications for the application of the Voting Rights Act in the future,\u201d the ACLU\u2019s Dale Ho, who has filed a brief in the case opposing the laws, said a recent event hosted by the liberal Constitutional Accountability Center. Biden asks Americans to choose country over party as restrictive Texas voting bill advances Michael Carvin, a lawyer for the Arizona Republican Party, for example, asked the justices to hold that no challenges that concern so called \u201ctime, manner, or place\u201d restrictions could be brought under Section 2. That would green light many of the laws that are currently being passed in states like Texas and Georgia. Texas, for instance, is pushing for a ban on after-hours voting, and a mandate to limit Sunday early voting as well as requiring voters requesting absentee ballots to provide their driver\u2019s license number or Social Security number. \u201cIf the Supreme Court weakens the Voting Rights Act as they are being asked to do, it will make it much harder to stop the kind of legislation we saw Texan lawmakers try to ram through over the weekend,\u201d Morales-Doyle said. Arizona\u2019s Attorney General Mark Brnovich takes a more nuanced position than the state GOP, arguing that a Section 2 violation requires a showing that the law produces a \u201csubstantial\u201d disparate impact. He told the justices during oral arguments that the laws at issue survive scrutiny because they are \u201ccommonsense\u201d and \u201ccommonplace\u201d and prevent voter fraud. The justices did not seem interested in the standard put forward by Carvin but that still leaves open plenty of room to limit Section 2 with a ruling that on its face may not appear to be too sweeping but still have a dramatic impact.   Ho and others are worried that the court could issue a ruling, for instance, that required evidence that there is a significant racially disparate impact on voter turnout. Such a standard would be hard for challengers to satisfy because it is difficult to always make a direct connection between fluctuations in voter turnout based on a single law. He is also concerned that the court could uphold the provisions based on the fact that they exist in other states with different circumstances. There is also apprehension on the part of progressives that the court could point to fraud prevention as a justification for the laws, even if voting rights experts say it is not a prevalent problem. Progressives seized on comments made by Carvin at oral arguments suggesting that the laws were necessary for pure politics. \u201cIt puts us at a competitive disadvantage relative to Democrats,\u201d he said in March. \u201cPolitics is a zero sum game, and every extra vote they get through unlawful interpretations of Section 2 hurts us.\u201d",

            "article_content": "American democracy \u2013 under a relentless, multi-front assault from pro-Donald Trump Republicans \u2013 is about to show whether it is strong enough to save itself. Such a premise would have been considered absurd through much of history. But since Trump left office after destroying the tradition of peaceful transfers of power in a failed attempt to steal the 2020 election, it has become clear that his insurrectionism was only the first battle in a longer political war as his allies tout ridiculous fantasies about returning him to power to applause and online acclaim. The mechanisms of American institutions that barely survived Trump\u2019s attempt to illegally stay in power are still being manipulated by Republicans to make the country less democratic. The GOP\u2019s efforts to stack the electoral decks are staggeringly broad. From Georgia to Arizona and Florida and in many other states, Republicans are mobilizing behind efforts to shorten voting hours, crack down on early and mail-in balloting and to throw out legitimate ballots \u2013 all under a banner of election security. While Trump may be banned from Twitter, he sends out daily statements pulsating with lies and incitement that percolate among supporters on social media. The ex-President\u2019s planned resumption of rallies next month will bring that anti-democratic stream of falsehood to a wider audience. And in the US Senate, Republicans will use filibuster rules \u2013 which critics see as the antithesis of democracy \u2013 to thwart Democratic legislation that seeks to combat all those efforts. President Joe Biden, who is in the White House because American democratic guardrails stood firm after his victory last November, raised the alarm on Tuesday after another bout of the GOP flexing its anti-democratic muscles. Just as Republicans are using the institutions to damage democracy, Biden and Democrats are targeting new laws that they believe would preserve it. Biden tasked Vice President Kamala Harris with leading an effort to protect the right to vote. \u201cThis sacred right is under assault with incredible intensity like I\u2019ve never seen \u2026 with an intensity of aggressiveness we\u2019ve not seen in a long, long time,\u201d Biden said in Tulsa, Oklahoma. The President was marking the 100th anniversary of a massacre of Black Americans, a scar on US history that he implicitly placed in the wider struggle of generations to perfect US democracy. But time is short to reverse democratic rollbacks by Republicans that are already causing fears that GOP officials could overturn future elections if their candidates are rejected in a majority vote. Trump tried to do exactly this with his unsuccessful pressure on local officials to steal the 2020 election in Georgia. The GOP capture of the House in 2022 midterm elections could make such a stolen election scenario a real threat in 2024. \u201cBy the time we get to the 2024 election, my fear is that election will be sent to the House of Representatives to decide if there are disputed electors,\u201d Daniel Ziblatt, a Harvard professor and co-author of the book \u201cHow Democracies Die,\u201d told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper on \u201cThe Lead.\u201d \u201cYou could very well imagine a situation where the 2020 and the 2021 January crisis was a dress rehearsal for what\u2019s to come in 2024.\u201d As Democrats try to prevent that happening, the Senate will shortly consider sweeping voting rights laws designed to establish national standards on issues like early voting, and to restore protections for Black voters removed by the Supreme Court and GOP legislators. A preview of that battle in Washington is currently playing out around the nation in the country\u2019s statehouses, most recently in Texas. Democratic state lawmakers in the Lone Star State walked out of their chamber over the weekend to deprive their Republican colleagues of a quorum needed to pass a restrictive voting bill built on Trump\u2019s Big Lie of election fraud. But Greg Abbott, the Republican governor of Texas, is vowing to call lawmakers back in a special session to pass the legislation and threatening to halt their pay over the walkout. He collected his reward on Tuesday with a reelection endorsement from the former President. The two voting rights bills in the US Senate face an unpromising future, since Republicans are vowing to halt what they are branding a Democratic power grab. Several Democratic senators, including West Virginia\u2019s Joe Manchin and Arizona\u2019s Kyrsten Sinema, would have to drop their firm opposition to abolishing or amending supermajority filibuster rules for the bills to pass. For the second time in a week Tuesday, Biden \u2013 who preaches national unity and bipartisanship and has treated Manchin with kid gloves \u2013 flashed irritation about the limitations of deadlocked Washington politics. Last week he held up a list of GOP senators who voted against his Covid-19 rescue law but claimed credit for some of its provisions among their constituents. In Tulsa, the President aimed an apparent swipe at Sinema and Manchin. \u201cI hear all the folks on TV saying, \u2018Why doesn\u2019t Biden get this done?\u2019 Well, because Biden only has a majority of effectively four votes in the House and a tie in the Senate, with two members of the Senate who vote more with my Republican friends,\u201d he said. It is not clear, given these apparently cemented political realities, exactly how Harris can turn back the tide of challenges to democracy. She could bring more visibility to the cause and perhaps help to organize popular opposition to restrictive voting bills. And she could be a powerful galvanizing force for Democratic turnout in 2022 that could make an end run around some new laws. But the entrenched reality of Republican power in many states and the obstructive mechanism of the Senate makes progress difficult. Harris may be able to test whether there is scope for a reworking of bills like the For the People Act to attract the support of more lawmakers. But there is concern even among some Democrats that the legislation is too broad, including as it relates to campaign finance regulations. It is highly unlikely she can persuade Republicans to vote for a measure that would reverse many state-level efforts to fortify their chances against demographic changes that threaten to consign White, conservative, religious Americans to permanent minority status. The vice president is however promising to devote energy to a task that Biden said on Tuesday would \u201ctake a hell of a lot of work.\u201d In a statement sent first to CNN, Harris said she would \u201cwork with voting rights organizations, community organizations, and the private sector to help strengthen and uplift efforts on voting rights nationwide. And we will also work with members of Congress to help advance these bills.\u201d A second bill \u2013 The John Lewis Voting Rights Act, also passed by the House of Representatives \u2013 is awaiting Senate action. The measure would restore a requirement for states with a record of racial discrimination in elections to submit changes to electoral laws to the federal government for review. The protections were gutted by a 2013 Supreme Court ruling that opened the way for a raft of current efforts to prejudice the rights of minority voters. While the GOP seeks to tilt elections, some of its members are pressing ahead with a whitewash of the 2020 contest. Wisconsin Sen. Ron Johnson, adding to the growing blanket of denial around Trump\u2019s Capitol insurrection on January 6, says he\u2019s conducting his own investigation to create an \u201caccurate historical record\u201d after voting against a bipartisan, independent probe into the outrage that would have done just that. The Republican filibuster blockade against the commission was a transparent attempt to protect Trump from further damaging revelations, after the ex-President all but ordered GOP leaders in the Senate and House to oppose it. But the attempt to pervert American democratic freedoms is not limited to elected Republicans. Former Trump national security adviser Michael Flynn indicated over the weekend the US needed a coup like the one in Myanmar. The Southeast Asian nation has been ruled by a paranoid and brutal military junta for much of the last 60 years. In its most recent coup, it moved to thwart a tentative path towards full democracy and the military has opened fire on hundreds of peaceful protesters and detained many more in inhumane prisons where torture is rife. Flynn later tried to walk back his comments, but the lack of any condemnation by senior Republican figures of his actions reflects a party wherein extremism is tolerated and therefore grows. Asked how worried he was about American democracy on a scale of 1-to-10, Ziblatt replied, \u201cEight,\u201d and pointed out that Trump had never been supported by a majority of Americans. But he also explained to Tapper why the current raft of anti-democratic actions in US institutions by Republicans was so concerning. \u201cAs long as the majority can speak, democracy is safe,\u201d Ziblatt said. \u201cI think the thing we have to worry about is that the institutions are being manipulated in a way to try to create a much more uneven playing field and that would be very dangerous.\u201d",

            "article_content": "New York City mayoral candidate Andrew Yang on Thursday accused a New York Daily News cartoon of engaging in racist tropes and playing on an idea of Asian-Americans as permanent tourists and outsiders. The cartoon, drawn by artist Bill Bramhall, depicts Yang exiting the Times Square subway station as a souvenir shop owner says, \u201cThe tourists are back!\u201d The candidate has at times taken heat for not voting in past mayoral races and for leaving the city at the height of the Covid-19 pandemic, though he said that Times Square was his favorite subway station. \u201cI think that anyone objective looking at that cartoon knows that it\u2019s playing on an idea of Asian-Americans as permanent tourists and outsiders. And we\u2019re at a point in our history, unfortunately, when Asian-Americans are getting beaten on the streets of New York and told to go back where we came from, or that we don\u2019t belong,\u201d Yang told CNN\u2019s John Berman Thursday on \u201cNew Day,\u201d referencing the surge in reported hate crimes and discrimination against the Asian American community amid the pandemic. Daily News\u2019 editorial page editor Josh Greenman has defended the cartoon against Yang\u2019s accusations. \u201cAndrew Yang is a leading contender to be mayor of New York City, and as commentators, his opponents and The News editorial board have recently pointed out, he\u2019s recently revealed there are major gaps in his knowledge of New York City politics and policy. Nor has he ever voted in a mayoral election,\u201d Greenman said. \u201cBill Bramhall\u2019s cartoon is a comment on that, period, end of story. This is not a racial stereotype or racist caricature.\u201d Greenman said that Bramhall changed his original, online cartoon for the newspaper print edition after \u201cpeople reacted badly to how Yang\u2019s eyes were drawn.\u201d \u201cBill altered the drawing out of sensitivity to those concerns, without changing the concept of the cartoon, which he and we stand by,\u201d he told the newspaper. From Bill Bramhall/New York Daily News Yang hit back on Thursday, telling CNN that \u201cThe Daily News characterizing it as simply a political commentary that does not include race just rings false.\u201d \u201cThe cartoon does not work if it\u2019s a person of a different race,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd I said Times Square is my favorite subway stop because I live blocks away in Hell\u2019s Kitchen and use that stop to get around the city. It goes just about anywhere in the city because there\u2019s so many lines that converge there.\u201d Born in Schenectady to Taiwanese parents, Yang has lived in New York City for 25 years and his wife, Evelyn, is from Queens. A former businessman, Yang had been faring well in the mayoral race due to his high level of name recognition following his 2020 Democratic campaign for president, during which he attracted attention for his freedom dividend plan and earned himself a devoted following. But he has been criticized over his lack of government experience. Asked Thursday how he would argue he knows as much about New York City politics and government as the other candidates, Yang told CNN, \u201cI am a public school parent. I know what families are going through here in the city.\u201d Yang is one of several candidates vying to replace Mayor Bill de Blasio in a competitive Democratic primary set for June 22. A second debate is scheduled for next Wednesday, and a third debate is set for June 16.",

            "article_content": "Nothing is sacred in a political age fueled by outrage. Even a few years ago, it would be an extraordinary thought that the Holocaust, in which millions of European Jews were wiped out in Adolf Hitler\u2019s crimes against humanity, would become the latest grubby Washington battlefield. No one who has visited the bleak preserved horror of the Auschwitz-Birkenau rail yard or walked into its gas chambers would make an analogy as offensive as Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene\u2019s appropriation of the Holocaust to protest mask wearing. And America already knows where the Republican Party\u2019s appeasement of this kind of extremism can lead. For four years, party leaders explained away, or enabled, former President Donald Trump\u2019s racial, social and cultural demagoguery. Their cowardice nurtured the Capitol insurrection and an unprecedented attack on American democracy. Now, by failing to punish another example of far right-wing zealotry in their ranks, they risk further swelling a tide of violent threats and incivility that is now a dominant feature in US politics and brings its own dangers. It took five days for the Republican House leadership to respond to the claim by Greene, a first-term Georgia congresswoman, that requiring people to don masks in a pandemic was comparable to the persecution of millions of Jews who were forced to wear fabric stars by the Nazis and later taken off to extermination camps. Greene\u2019s apparent escape from serious consequences for her rhetoric cheapens one of history\u2019s worst crimes. The use of the Holocaust in such a context also represents another rejection of basic, provable facts by a key member of the GOP in a grab for political power. And Greene\u2019s complaint about mask wearing being a form of persecution comparable to the Nazis also underscored the vibrant strain of self-victimization and grievance that runs deep in Trumpism, which its leaders use as a galvanizing force. And when they did react, statements by leaders \u2013 the same ones who forced Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney out of her leadership job because she stood up to the authoritarian extremism of Trump \u2013 were tainted by political opportunism. House Republican Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, who has worked to rehabilitate Trump\u2019s reputation after his attempted coup, released a statement saying, \u201cMarjorie was wrong,\u201d and that her comparison was \u201cappalling.\u201d \u201cLet me be clear, the House Republican conference condemns this language,\u201d the California Republican said. But the only reason it wasn\u2019t clear was because McCarthy took so long to say it, likely reluctant to rebuke a lawmaker supported by Trump. Greene is also a new star in conservative media and is beloved by the ex-President\u2019s supporters who the GOP will need in the midterm elections. Like his other leadership colleagues, McCarthy turned his statement into a partisan attack, accusing Democrats of ignoring and fomenting anti-Semitism. He later weaponized the fight against that scourge by introducing a bill that lashed out at liberal Democrats like New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and blamed their criticism of Israel for inciting violence against American Jews. The conflict between Israel and the militant group Hamas did spur considerable criticism of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu\u2019s government from Democrats. And it also triggered an alarming spike of hatred and attacks against some American Jews from California to New York to Florida. Sometimes in the past, criticism of Israel by prominent Democrats has crossed the line into anti-Semitism. Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota was, for instance, forced to apologize by party leaders for using anti-Semitic tropes about Israel\u2019s US supporters. But by drawing a direct equivalent between criticism of Israel \u2013 over issues like disproportionate deaths of Palestinian civilians in the Gaza conflict \u2013 and anti-Semitism, McCarthy may be making an already fraught issue more complicated. Some US Jewish groups have, for example, tried to point out during Middle East conflicts that criticism of Israeli policy does not automatically equate to anti-Semitism. Greene\u2019s willingness to speak so casually of the Holocaust is the latest example of a trend of ahistorical analogizing that often seeks to compare modern day events to history\u2019s most painful chapters. The custodians of the Auschwitz Memorial site in Poland thought so too. \u201cThe instrumentalization of the tragedy of Jews who suffered, were humiliated, marked with a yellow star, isolated in ghettos & murdered during the Holocaust, in a debate on different systems that aim at protecting public health is a sad symptom of moral and intellectual decline,\u201d the Twitter account for the Auschwitz Memorial posted on Tuesday. Ill-informed comparisons to Hitler\u2019s murderous regime are not a phenomenon unique to Republicans. Sometimes, during the Trump administration, activists on the left used to compare statements or actions by the former President with those of Hitler. While his presidency did end in a riot of lawlessness and anti-democratic violence, nothing he did came anywhere near the vile inhumanity of the Nazis. For decades, while World War II veterans were alive and Holocaust survivors provided personal testimony about the evils of the past, offensive comments like Greene\u2019s were harder to justify in public. But now that generation is mostly faded away, the lessons of its experience of inhumanity are at risk of being forgotten or de-emphasized. The late Elie Wiesel, a human rights campaigner and survivor of the Auschwitz and Buchenwald concentration camps, spoke to the obligation of future generations when he said that \u201cwhoever listens to a witness becomes a witness.\u201d Casual and flippant references to the Holocaust dishonor that duty. In many ways, Greene\u2019s behavior \u2013 after being stripped by a Democratic-led House of her committee assignments for past anti-Semitic statements and condoning violence against Democratic leaders \u2013 is in the image of Trump. She seems to pick the most incendiary possible comment, designed to attract outrage and attention, and that brings down a media storm \u2013 which she (and Trump) then turns on its head to suggest she is the one being persecuted. \u201cThe media and Democrats and everyone feeding into it is allowing them to hide the truth, which is the digusting (sic) anti-semitism within the Democrat Party,\u201d Greene said in a tweet thread on Tuesday. As is often the case in such controversies, her statement, which was really a new attack filled with rage, contained an apology that was not an apology. \u201cSorry some of my words make people uncomfortable, but this is what the American left is all about,\u201d Greene wrote. The Georgia lawmaker\u2019s firebrand reputation has made her a celebrity in conservative media \u2013 and one of her party\u2019s most prolific fundraisers since she arrived in Washington in January. The next likely stage of the latest Greene saga could be expected to feature pro-Trump media propagandists claiming that \u201cmainstream\u201d journalists are willfully misinterpreting her remarks, powering new disinformation on biased news networks that helped to convince millions of Republicans that Trump\u2019s lies about a stolen election are true. Such a whitewash occurred when Trump said there were \u201cvery fine people, on both sides\u201d of a clash between white supremacists and anti-racism groups in Charlottesville, Virginia, in August 2017. And the price of Republicans excusing Trump-style extremism was laid bare when the ex-President told the Proud Boys \u2013 members of which allegedly stormed the Capitol on January 6 \u2013 \u201cto stand back and stand by\u201d during a presidential debate. Trump fans denied that the ex-President ever offered legitimacy to the group even though he made the comment on live television. In recent weeks, some Republican members of Congress have sought to deny the facts that millions of Americans saw on their television about his culpability in the Capitol insurrection and the violence of Trump\u2019s mob. Their denial has led the party to turn against the idea of a bipartisan, independent probe into the Capitol Hill invasion and further cementing a narrative that the GOP has turned against truth and democracy. The transformation in a party that once stood for the preservation of such pillars of a free society still puzzles Illinois Rep. Adam Kinzinger, one of the handful of Republican lawmakers ready to stand up to Trump and Greene. \u201cWhat we can do as a party is take a stand and say, \u2018You don\u2019t belong in our conference.\u2019 That\u2019s what I think we should do,\u201d Kinzinger said during a Politico Playbook interview on Monday. \u201cIf there was a kind of organic, within-the-conference movement to oust Liz Cheney, certainly we can have the same kind of movement to oust somebody that is trying to compare wearing a mask to the Nazis.\u201d",

            "article_content": "President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris on Monday condemned recent attacks toward the Jewish community after several Jewish people were targeted in cities across the US and abroad as tensions flare over the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. \u201cThe recent attacks on the Jewish community are despicable, and they must stop. I condemn this hateful behavior at home and abroad \u2013 it\u2019s up to all of us to give hate no safe harbor,\u201d Biden tweeted Monday. Harris added later: \u201cThe surge in anti-Semitic attacks against the Jewish community in the U.S. and around the world is despicable\u2014it must be called out, condemned, and stopped. As a country, we must stand united against hate of any kind.\u201d The attacks appear to be inspired by the latest round of violence in the Middle East between Israel and Palestinian militant group Hamas, with the perpetrators in one incident in Los Angeles being identified as pro-Palestinian men. They have added to a climate of fear in the Jewish community that has been exacerbated by conspiracies propagated by politicians in the US, said Jonathan Greenblatt, CEO and national director of the Anti-Defamation League. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen a series of acts of vandalism and harassment, and the abuse online \u2026 has been staggering,\u201d Greenblatt said Sunday on CNN\u2019s \u201cNewsroom.\u201d \u201cAnd so when you see wild conspiracy theories about the Jewish people or the Jewish state, we shouldn\u2019t be surprised where there are real world consequences when Jewish people get harmed and hurt.\u201d Police departments in two of America\u2019s largest cities are investigating anti-Semitic incidents that took place over the last week and are bracing for more. The New York Police Department is stepping up its presence in New York City\u2019s Jewish communities following two anti-Semitic incidents in Brooklyn\u2019s Borough Park neighborhood on Saturday evening, Mayor Bill de Blasio said Sunday afternoon.\u00a0And in California, the Los Angeles Police Department is investigating an altercation last week near Hollywood in which witnesses said Jewish people dining at a restaurant were targeted by a group of pro-Palestinian men driving past in vehicles. The LAPD is treating the incident as a possible hate crime. Last week, Israel and the Palestinian militant group Hamas agreed to a ceasefire after more than a week of conflict.\u00a0Over 11 days, the Israel Defense Forces carried out a devastating aerial bombardment of Gaza, while Hamas fired thousands of rockets into Israel. Israeli airstrikes and artillery fire killed 248 Palestinians, including 66 children, according to the Hamas-run health ministry in Gaza. At least 12 people in Israel, including two children, were killed as a result of Palestinian militant fire, according to the IDF and Israel\u2019s emergency service. While the recent violence in the Middle East appears to be the inciting incident for the attacks in New York and Los Angeles, the US has seen a wider trend of politicians being willing to embrace anti-Semitic tropes and groups with a history of racism. Then-President Donald Trump refused to condemn white supremacists during the 2020 campaign, telling the far-right Proud Boys to \u201cstand back and stand by.\u201d He frequently downplayed the threat from white supremacists during his presidency and made stoking racial tensions key to his reelection strategy. And when Trump and other members of Congress falsely claimed the election was stolen, many people at the January 6 Capitol insurrection displayed symbols of racist, white supremacist, and extremist groups. Last week, Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Georgia Republican, sparked bipartisan outrage when she sought to tie a mask mandate on the House floor to the Holocaust. During an interview with the Christian Broadcasting Network\u2019s David Brody on his Real America\u2019s Voice TV show \u201cThe Water Cooler,\u201d Greene accused House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a California Democrat, of being a hypocrite for asking GOP members to prove they have all been vaccinated before allowing members to be in the House chamber without a mask. \u201cYou know, we can look back at a time in history where people were told to wear a gold star, and they were definitely treated like second-class citizens, so much so that they were put in trains and taken to gas chambers in Nazi Germany,\u201d Greene said. \u201cAnd this is exactly the type of abuse that Nancy Pelosi is talking about.\u201d Greene has since doubled down on that comparison, claiming that \u201cany rational Jewish person\u201d would agree with her. Rep. Liz Cheney, a Wyoming Republican, called Greene\u2019s initial comments \u201cevil lunacy\u201d in a tweet, but Republican leadership has been silent on the matter so far. The Georgia congresswoman\u2019s anti-Semitic comments aren\u2019t the only prejudiced sentiments propagated in the United States Congress. Rep. Scott Perry spread the racist \u201creplacement theory\u201d during a House Foreign Affairs Committee hearing last month. In 2019, Rep. Ilhan Omar, a Minnesota Democrat, was reprimanded after making reference to an anti-Semitic trope while criticizing Republican support of the American Israel Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC). Two teenagers aged 18 and 17 were approached in New York by two men who \u201cdemanded that the victims repeat anti-Jewish statements,\u201d according to an NYPD statement. When the victims refused, one of the men put the 17-year-old in a \u201crear chokehold,\u201d the department said, adding that one attacker also chased the victims while \u201cbrandishing a baseball bat\u201d as they ran away. The alleged attackers fled in a blue Toyota Camry, according to police. Within the same hour that evening, three male occupants of a blue Toyota Camry began \u201cto yell anti-Jewish statements\u201d toward four male victims in front of a nearby synagogue, the NYPD said in another statement. Last week, a man was arrested after a 29-year-old Jewish man was punched, kicked and pepper-sprayed Thursday during an incident in New York\u2019s Times Square, CNN previously reported. The assault involved about five to six men who allegedly yelled anti-Semitic statements, CNN reported. The New York Police Department\u2019s Hate Crime Task Force tweeted that it is investigating the incident and Gov. Andrew Cuomo, a Democrat, has directed the State Police Hate Crimes Task Force to assist in the investigation. A woman who said she was dining at the restaurant in Los Angeles told CNN that the people in the cars began throwing bottles at the group and yelled anti-Semitic slurs, including the words \u201cdirty Jew.\u201d Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti condemned the attack and said the city would meet the incident \u201cwith a full force of law.\u201d \u201cOur police department together with our sheriff\u2019s department, our FBI, and other partners is rightly investigating this assault as a hate crime,\u201d he said.

            "article_content": "One of the original culture war conflicts may be poised for a resurgence \u2013 with potentially explosive political consequences. The Supreme Court\u2019s recent decision to consider the legality of Mississippi\u2019s restrictive law prohibiting abortions after 15 weeks of pregnancy could trigger the most serious and sustained political debate over the procedure since the final decades of the 20th century. And that could dramatically widen the already gaping demographic and geographic fissures between red and blue America. Public opinion over abortion today is much more polarized along party lines than it was in the first decades after the Supreme Court established a nationwide right to it in the 1973 Roe v. Wade decision. Reflecting those divisions, red and blue states are poised to hurtle in radically different directions if the court grants them more leeway to regulate abortion by retrenching, or even reversing, the Roe decision through its ruling in the Mississippi case. Roe v. Wade Fast Facts The battle over abortion that erupted in the 1970s helped trigger a decades-long political realignment that has re-sorted the two parties\u2019 coalitions more along lines of cultural attitudes than class interests. But since the Supreme Court reaffirmed the Roe ruling in 1992 in another landmark decision, that debate has been largely abstract and distant, with relatively few Americans seriously believing that the right to abortion could be revoked, pollsters say. A new Supreme Court ruling providing states greater freedom to restrict abortion access, which could come before the 2022 elections, would dramatically change that equation by making the debate far more tangible. \u201cIt\u2019s one thing to say it\u2019s a symbolic issue that signals what team you play for,\u201d says Robert P. Jones, founder and CEO of the Public Religion Research Institute, a nonpartisan group that studies Americans\u2019 attitudes about cultural issues. \u201cBut it\u2019s another thing to say this is something that is actually going to affect people\u2019s lives on the ground, their health, their ability to plan their families. All of these are very concrete ways in which this issue could come out of the abstract intellectual debate into the streets in a way we haven\u2019t seen\u201d for decades. Put another way, while many of today\u2019s most volatile social issue disputes involve statements of values that will touch vanishingly few Americans in their daily lives \u2013 very few people, for instance, will ever have to decide whether to bake a cake or take the photos for a same-sex wedding \u2013 the potential for significant new restrictions, or even bans, on abortion would amount to a culture war with more widely felt consequences. Abortion was part of the explosive complex of issues that shifted the axis of American politics during the 1960s and 1970s. During the first decades after World War II \u2013 the years of electoral dominance for what became known as the Democrats\u2019 \u201cNew Deal\u201d coalition \u2013 the principal dividing line in the electorate was economic: Most people above a certain level of income and education voted Republican and most below it voted Democratic. But starting in the mid-1960s with civil rights and voting rights for African Americans \u2013 and then continuing with fierce debates over crime, welfare and changing attitudes about family, sex and the role of women in American life \u2013 the central dividing line between the competing coalitions started to shift, with Democrats drawing more voters who approved of the ways society was changing and Republicans more of those who felt threatened by it. Abortion contributed to that process when the Supreme Court, in its January 22, 1973, Roe v. Wade decision, established a constitutional right to abortion in every state. The first backlash to the Roe decision came primarily from groups representing US Catholics. Initially through the mid-1970s, many White evangelical Protestant ministers, who were just beginning their own activism in conservative politics, resisted allying with Catholics (with whom they had bitter, centuries-old religious differences) to oppose abortion. But as the decade proceeded, the desire to build the broadest possible coalition of cultural and religious conservatives prompted leaders from Catholic political strategist Paul Weyrich to evangelical minister Jerry Falwell to link arms behind the anti-abortion cause in the hope of assembling what they called a \u201cmoral majority.\u201d Faced with \u201cthe imperative of fighting the liberals on every front,\u201d wrote historian Rick Perlstein in his recent book on the late 1970s, \u201cReaganland,\u201d \u201cpolitical necessity begat theological flexibility\u201d among the awakening evangelical activists. But the shift from a political system primarily based on class to one that revolves mostly around culture still took decades to fully unfold, and for years after the Roe decision Democrats won support from many culturally conservative voters, just as Republicans did from those with more liberal social views. The result was that initially the right to abortion divided both parties\u2019 coalitions. \u201cIt really cut across party lines for a long time,\u201d says Alan Abramowitz, a political scientist at Emory University. Figures provided to me by the Gallup organization underscore his point. Since the mid-1970s, Gallup has been asking Americans whether abortion should be legal in all circumstances, legal in certain circumstances or always illegal. In an April 1975 poll, the results among Republicans and Democrats were virtually identical, with around one-fifth of each saying abortion should always be legal, half saying it should be so in certain circumstances and the rest saying it should always be illegal. In a May 1981 poll, a few months after Ronald Reagan won election on a platform of opposition to legal abortion, slightly more Republicans than Democrats believed abortion should be legal, either always or in certain circumstances, Gallup found. Results Abramowitz analyzed for me from the University of Michigan\u2019s American National Election Studies, a long-standing election-year poll, point toward the same striking conclusion. In his losing 1980 race against Reagan, Democratic President Jimmy Carter won almost exactly the same share of the vote among those who said abortion should never be available as those who said it should always be legal; those who said abortion should never be legal actually gave Carter more support than those who said it should be allowed rarely or sometimes. As Abramowitz notes, this cross-cutting pressure on abortion within each party \u201cwas reflected in the kinds of people who were getting elected. For a long time, you would get quite a few pro-choice Republicans and pro-life Democrats.\u201d That was displayed during Reagan\u2019s presidency when conservatives mounted their most serious legislative attempt \u2013 arguably to this day \u2013 to eliminate the right to abortion. That effort culminated in a June 1983 Senate vote on a \u201cHuman Life Amendment\u201d to the Constitution that would have overturned Roe and allowed states again to ban abortion. The amendment, which needed support from two-thirds of the Senate, failed, drawing only 49 votes in favor, with 50 opposed. In a pattern almost unimaginable today, 15 Senate Democrats, many of them from the South, voted for the amendment, while 19 Republicans, many from the Northeast or West Coast, voted against it. Over the succeeding decades, and especially in this century, cultural and racial attitudes have increasingly displaced class interests as the central glue of the parties. That current widened the differences between the parties on abortion. By the time a closely divided Supreme Court reaffirmed the nationwide right to abortion in the 1992 Planned Parenthood v. Casey decision, a gap had opened between Republican and Democratic views. In 1991 Gallup results, Democrats were 8 percentage points more likely than Republicans to say abortion should be legal in all circumstances; in the 1992 election, according to the American National Election Studies data, Democrat Bill Clinton ran about 25 points better among those who said abortion should always be legal than with those who said it should never be available. But even so, in both his 1992 and 1996 elections, Clinton (who famously declared that abortion should be \u201csafe, legal and rare\u201d) won nearly half the voters who wanted abortion available either never or rarely, the National Election Studies found. Since then, as the electorate\u2019s re-sorting along cultural lines has proceeded, the distance between the parties on abortion has exploded. While the share of Republicans who believed abortion should always be legal rose from the 1970s through the 1990s, Gallup found that by 2020, it had fallen to just 13%. By contrast, the share of Democrats who said abortion should be legal in all circumstances soared to 49% in 2020, well over double its level in the 1970s and early 1980s. In the 2020 presidential race, according to the National Election Studies data, Joe Biden won more than four-fifths of voters who said abortion should always be legal, but only one-fifth of those who said it should always be illegal and fewer than 3 in 10 of those who wanted it only \u201crarely\u201d available. Roe vs. Wade was enacted in order to make sure that every woman in every state could have access to abortion and therefore choice over their lives. And it should not be dependent on their ZIP code. Democratic Rep. Judy Chu of California The same polarization was evident when congressional Republicans, during Donald Trump\u2019s presidency, advanced legislation to ban abortion after 20 weeks. In contrast to the extensive partisan defections in 1983, just two Senate Republicans in 2020 opposed that bill (Lisa Murkowski of Alaska and Susan Collins of Maine) and only two Senate Democrats (Bob Casey of Pennsylvania and Joe Manchin of West Virginia) backed it. The ban fell well short of the 60 votes needed to overcome a Senate filibuster. In all these ways, a Supreme Court decision eliminating or further restricting abortion rights would land in a country where the issue divides the parties far more starkly than it did at the time of Roe. The separation extends beyond Washington through the states. If the Supreme Court gives states more freedom to limit abortion, nearly two dozen states have laws on the books that would either ban abortion entirely or cut off access much earlier in pregnancy, according to a tabulation by the Guttmacher Institute, a research and advocacy group that studies reproductive issues. Almost all of those states were won by Trump. With the prospect in sight that a more conservative Supreme Court may authorize tighter limits, Republican-controlled states are passing laws at an accelerating pace that clearly undermine Roe\u2019s protections: This year alone, Idaho, Oklahoma, South Carolina and Texas have all approved legislation banning abortions after a fetal heartbeat is detected, which can occur as early as six weeks into pregnancy, in practice a near-total prohibition. Arkansas went further, banning abortion \u201cexcept to save the life of a pregnant woman in a medical emergency,\u201d and Oklahoma passed a similar law in addition to its heartbeat measure. For now, Roe prohibits the enforcement of those laws, but that could change depending on how the court rules in the Mississippi case. In practice, red states already impose many more obstacles to abortion than blue ones, but conservatives welcome the prospect that the court would allow them to diverge further on the core legal question of access to abortion at all. We did some focus groups around this issue a while back and one of the things we found is that many of the references to coat hangers and back-alley abortions and fears of returning to a pre-Roe world were kind of lost on young people, and it\u2019s largely because they grew up in a world where abortion is legal. It\u2019s just a fixed part of the legal landscape, even the cultural landscape, for them. So I think they\u2019ve never really thought of it as something under threat. Robert P. Jones, founder and CEO, Public Religion Research Institute Allowing states to set their own disparate rules on abortion \u201cwould certainly stabilize the issue by returning the question back to the hands of the American people,\u201d Penny Nance, CEO and president of Concerned Women for America, a social conservative group, wrote me in an e-mail. \u201cThis is the work of freedom, allowing our citizens to debate the issue and develop new policies by convincing one another of what is best.\u201d But Kristin Ford, national communications director for NARAL Pro-Choice America, a leading abortion rights group, says the court would precipitate pitched political battles even in the red states if it weakens or reverses Roe. \u201cOnce these [state] bills can become law and it is less of an intellectual exercise, I think there will be significant backlash,\u201d Ford says. \u201cIt is not the case that voters in red states believe abortion should be completely illegal or inaccessible.\u201d James Henson, executive director of the Texas Politics Project at the University of Texas (Austin), largely agrees. In a recent University of Texas/Texas Tribune poll, a 49% to 41% plurality of Texas adults said they supported the six-week abortion ban that state Republicans approved this month (but which cannot be implemented unless the Supreme Court revises Roe). But Henson says he does not believe \u201csupport would hold up\u201d if the law could actually go into effect because \u201cit\u2019s effectively a ban on abortion.\u201d And while many Texans \u201care very open to making the process of obtaining an abortion a strict one,\u201d he told me, a consistent majority want to ensure \u201cthe option is there.\u201d Support for such a restrictive limit, he predicts, would erode if the issue switched from \u201cthinking about a poll question or hearing an opinion leader talk about it\u201d to \u201cthe experience actual real women are going to have\u201d in not even necessarily realizing \u201cthat they are pregnant before they hit the six-week marker.\u201d Henson\u2019s comments point toward the potential for the Supreme Court to ignite a much more intense conflagration over abortion than the nation has seen in decades. For all the heated rhetoric on either side, and all the moves red states have undertaken in recent years to reduce access to abortion (for instance by tightly regulating abortion clinics), the bedrock legal right to the procedure has not been seriously threatened since the Casey decision nearly three decades ago, legal scholars agree. As a result, many Americans, especially younger ones, consider abortion largely a settled issue, public opinion analysts note. \u201cWe did some focus groups around this issue a while back and one of the things we found is that many of the references to coat hangers and back-alley abortions and fears of returning to a pre-Roe world were kind of lost on young people, and it\u2019s largely because they grew up in a world where abortion is legal,\u201d says Jones of the Public Religion Research Institute. \u201cIt\u2019s just a fixed part of the legal landscape, even the cultural landscape, for them. So I think they\u2019ve never really thought of it as something under threat.\u201d Just the prospect of a Supreme Court decision revising Roe will spotlight more attention on abortion in coming months. Democratic Rep. Judy Chu of California told me in an interview that by early June she will reintroduce her legislation codifying in federal law the legal right to abortion established under Roe; White House press secretary Jen Psaki reaffirmed last week that Biden supported such a bill. In the last Congress, the bill attracted 216 Democratic co-sponsors, and abortion rights advocates are confident that amid the risk of an adverse high court ruling it could draw enough votes to pass the House. \u201cRoe vs. Wade was enacted in order to make sure that every woman in every state could have access to abortion and therefore choice over their lives,\u201d Chu told me. \u201cAnd it should not be dependent on their ZIP code.\u201d The question of whether a baby at 15 weeks gestation deserves legal protection is a losing political strategy for Democrats. Penny Nance, CEO and president, Concerned Women for America But Chu also says it\u2019s not clear whether House Democrats will take up the legislation before the Supreme Court rules in the Mississippi case, which might not come until June 2022. And even if the House approves it, a law codifying Roe would join the long list of liberal priorities that have no chance of clearing the Senate unless the Democratic majority there agrees to retrench or eliminate the filibuster. (Even reaching 50 votes for such a bill might not be guaranteed there.) Yet even if Congress stalemates on abortion, that might only make a Supreme Court decision restricting it more salient in the 2022 and 2024 elections. The safest prediction is that more focus on abortion would reinforce the dynamics already polarizing the parties along lines of education, religious practice and geography. A full-scale battle over abortion would likely help Republicans further strengthen the hold over culturally conservatives Whites that the party has solidified in this century, and potentially make further inroads among anti-abortion Hispanics, especially those who are evangelical Protestants. Nance says conservatives are confident they can win the argument for imposing limits on abortion at least as strict as those Mississippi is seeking. \u201cThe question of whether a baby at 15 weeks gestation deserves legal protection is a losing political strategy for Democrats,\u201d she wrote me. But most Democratic strategists, and even some Republicans, believe that a renewed focus on limiting abortion would exacerbate the GOP\u2019s already formidable problems with college-educated White voters, as well as younger and more secular voters. In the Public Religion Research Institute\u2019s latest polling, more than two-thirds of college-educated White women and nearly two-thirds of both college-educated White men and all adults under 30 said abortion should remain legal in all or most circumstances. So did more than four-fifths of adults who don\u2019t identify with any religious tradition \u2013 now about one-fourth of the population. Though a renewed focus on abortion would surely feed the forces separating the parties demographically and geographically, the bottom line still tilts toward the Democrats: Most Americans have consistently expressed the desire to maintain Roe\u2019s basic protections since the ruling almost 50 years ago. Overall, the Public Religion Research Institute found, a solid three-fifths majority of Americans believed abortion should remain legal in all or most cases. In Gallup\u2019s polling since the 1970s, no more than about one-fifth of adults have ever said abortion should be completely banned; even among Republicans, only a little over one-fourth support that step today. Supreme Court to take up case next term that could limit Roe v. Wade In a reversal of the initial political reaction during the 1970s, the Public Religion Research Institute found that White evangelical Protestants are now the only religious group in which a substantial majority say abortion should be illegal in all or most cases; even a narrow majority of White Catholics believe abortion should mostly remain legal. (Slightly more Hispanic Protestants opposed than supported legal abortion, the only other major group for which that was true.) Ford of NARAL says that Republican elected officials over recent years have had the best of both worlds: \u201cThey have walked this tightrope for a long time of throwing red meat to their most extreme base\u201d by voting for severe abortion restrictions in the states or in Washington, while secure in the knowledge that those laws could not be implemented, and potentially trigger a backlash, because of Roe. The Supreme Court\u2019s Mississippi decision could unsettle that balance by allowing more \u2013 or conceivably all \u2013 of those restrictive laws to go into effect, thrilling some voters and terrifying others. And that could trigger powerfully disruptive new tremors along the fault line over abortion that runs deeply through the American electorate but has remained mostly dormant for decades.",

            "article_content": "The essay described congressional extremists, their rejection of truth, a party turning into authoritarians or \u201can apocalyptic cult.\u201d It bore a striking headline: \u201cLet\u2019s just say it: The Republicans are the problem.\u201d It didn\u2019t mention Marjorie Taylor Greene, the deadly January 6 insurrection or Donald Trump\u2019s Big Lie. In fact, the words \u201cDonald Trump\u201d did not appear at all. Published in 2012, that Washington Post piece demonstrates more than the foresight of its political scientist authors, Tom Mann of the center-left Brookings Institution and Norm Ornstein of the center-right American Enterprise Institute. It shows the disease within the Republican Party had spread long before Trump metastasized it. Their conclusions \u2013 that the GOP had become \u201cideologically extreme, scornful of compromise, unmoved by conventional understanding of facts, evidence and science, dismissive of the legitimacy of its political opposition\u201d \u2013 did not gain wide acceptance then. Many journalists joined leading Republicans in dismissing them. Here are the 63 Republicans who voted against the anti-Asian hate crimes bill \u201cUltra, ultra liberals\u201d whose views \u201ccarry no weight with me,\u201d sneered Senate GOP leader Mitch McConnell. \u201cI thought they overstated things,\u201d Republican Charlie Dent, then serving his fourth term in the House from Pennsylvania, recalls now. \u201cPeople like me were thinking, \u2018Yeah, there are some kooky people around, but c\u2019mon,\u2019\u201d says William Kristol, who was then editing the conservative Weekly Standard magazine. With John Boehner as House speaker and Mitt Romney winning the GOP presidential nomination, Kristol saw the Republican mainstream still in command. All have since gotten slugged by reality. What ailed the party in 2012 has worsened. Kristol\u2019s magazine, having diverged from Trump-era orthodoxy, no longer exists. Of his earlier sources of reassurance: Boehner fled Congress to author a book decrying his colleagues\u2019 dysfunction; Romney has become a pariah as the only Republican senator who twice voted to convict Trump on impeachment charges. Dent, now a CNN political commentator, quit the House after moderates like him became further marginalized. McConnell was shaken by violence inside the US Capitol for which he declared the defeated Republican President \u201cpractically and morally responsible.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t get much satisfaction out of being right,\u201d says Mann, now retired in California. \u201cA country, and a system, like ours has to have two strong governing parties. The fact is, we only have one.\u201d How a once-bipartisan commission to investigate the Capitol Riot fell apart \u201cIt\u2019s a grim picture for the foreseeable future,\u201d adds Ornstein. \u201cWe have a serious risk of losing our democracy.\u201d GOP office-holders keep showing why. Denying the scientific facts of climate change no longer suffices. House Republican have made honesty a disqualification for party leadership. They fired Rep. Liz Cheney as conference chair for refusing to obscure the truth about President Joe Biden\u2019s victory. Most rank-and-file Republicans, polls show, believe Trump\u2019s lies about voter fraud. Mann and Ornstein described party leaders\u2019 refusal to rein in lawmakers like Allen West of Florida, who falsely asserted that \u201c78 to 81\u201d congressional Democrats were communists. Out of Congress and relocated, West now chairs the Texas GOP. His 2021 successors have grown loonier. Greene won a House seat from Georgia last year after expressing support for bizarre QAnon fantasies, which link Democrats with pedophilia. When Mann and Ornstein wrote their 2012 piece, Tea Party Republicans had menaced the American economy with a debt crisis. But this year\u2019s insurrection created physical menace \u2013 for Capitol Police, lawmakers of both parties, even then-Vice President Mike Pence. Cheney warns that Trump may incite further violence. She told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper that House GOP colleagues voted against impeaching Trump because they were \u201cafraid, in some instances, for their lives.\u201d A White Missourian who gained fame by pointing a gun at racial justice protesters got invited to speak at Trump\u2019s 2020 nominating convention; he has now launched a GOP Senate candidacy. An AEI poll this year found most Republicans agree \u201cthe traditional American way of life is disappearing so fast that we may have to use force to save it.\u201d Republicans choose power over truth as hopes for bipartisan January 6 commission dim What alarms them are the evolving demographic, cultural and economic realities of 21st century America. The country continues to become less White, less Christian, less financially rewarding for workers without advanced technical skills or higher education. The GOP voting base is increasingly dominated by older, blue-collar, evangelical Whites in economically lagging towns and rural areas. Conservative media outlets stoke nativist anger over their loss of status and power. Democrats have drawn more popular votes in seven of the last eight presidential elections. So in key states like Georgia, using Trump\u2019s lies as fuel, Republicans now seek new election rules to help them win. \u201cI don\u2019t like where we\u2019re heading, but don\u2019t think it\u2019s inevitable that we get to that terrible place,\u201d says Dent. He recently joined more than 100 prominent Republicans in a letter imploring the GOP to \u201crededicate itself to founding ideals.\u201d \u201cFor the people who want to tell themselves that the Republican Party\u2019s salvageable, there\u2019s always just enough hope,\u201d Kristol says. McConnell\u2019s January condemnation of Trump suggested the most powerful remaining Republican in Washington might chart a new path. After the insurrection was quashed, the seven-term Kentucky senator angrily assailed \u201ccriminal behavior\u201d that \u201ctried to disrupt our democracy.\u201d But like his House counterpart Kevin McCarthy, McConnell cares most about recapturing the majority in next year\u2019s elections. For obvious reasons, Trump opposes the House-passed measure creating a bipartisan, 9/11-style commission to investigate the insurrection. Dependent on the former President\u2019s support, McCarthy led the overwhelming majority of House Republicans last week in voting no. McConnell, too, fell in line. \u201cI\u2019ve made the decision to oppose the House Democrats\u2019 slanted and unbalanced proposal,\u201d he said. That virtually ensures it will die in the Senate by Republican filibuster.",

            "article_content": "West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin, a Democrat, and Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski, a Republican, issued a letter this week urging Congress to find a bipartisan path forward to reauthorize the decades-old Voting Rights Act. The missive to congressional leaders in the House and Senate seeks to break through the impasse on voting rights legislation as Republican-led states around the country erect new barriers to the ballot box. \u201cSince enactment, the Voting Rights Act of 1965 has been reauthorized and amended five times with large, bipartisan majorities,\u201d the senators wrote. \u201cProtecting Americans\u2019 access to democracy has not been a partisan issue for the past 56 years, and we must not allow it to become one now.\u201d But partisan battles have dominated voting rights debates in Washington and in the states, and bipartisan compromise appears elusive on any of the federal voting bills. Here\u2019s a look at the competing election bills in Congress and obstacles to their passage: These sweeping measures, designated as S.1 in the Senate and H.R.1 in the House, touch on everything from the ground rules for voting to new disclosure requirements for presidents and changes to campaign finance law. On elections, they would set a federal baseline for election rules and thwart some of the voting restrictions passed in key battleground states this year. Among other things: They would mandate 15 days of early voting and neuter states\u2019 strict voter ID requirements by allowing voters casting ballots in federal elections to submit a sworn affidavit instead of identification. They also would require automatic and same-day voter registration and pre-paid postage on absentee ballots. Although iterations of the bills have been around for several years, their proponents say the push to clamp down on access to the ballot in Republican-led states give them new urgency. Republicans in Congress, including Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, call the push a partisan takeover of elections and show no signs of ever backing the bills \u2013 a problem in a Senate that\u2019s divided 50-50 along partisan lines. (Vice President Kamala Harris can break ties, giving Democrats a narrow edge on some matters, such as confirming executive branch nominees.) \u201cOur democracy is not in crisis,\u201d McConnell declared last week during committee debate on the For the People Act, \u201cand we are not going to let one party take over our democracy under the false pretense of saving it.\u201d The For the People Act passed the Democratic-controlled House earlier his year. But it\u2019s mired in the Senate, where it lacks Manchin\u2019s support and faces a wall of resistance from Republicans. Last week, members of the evenly divided Senate Rules Committee deadlocked 9-9 on moving it out of committee. Although Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, has procedural avenues to bring the bill to the floor, it\u2019s unlikely to ever pass unless the 60-vote threshold to overcome a legislative filibuster is dismantled. And Manchin, along with Republicans and several other moderate Democrats, opposes abandoning the filibuster. This proposal, named after late Georgia Democratic congressman and civil rights icon John Lewis aims to restore enforcement provisions of the Voting Rights Act. It first became law in 1965, shortly after a bloody law enforcement attack on peaceful voting rights activists on a bridge in Selma, Alabama, shocked and shamed the nation into action. The Voting Rights Act\u2019s requirements \u2013 that nine states and parts of others with a history of racial discrimination win federal approval, or \u201cpre-clearance\u201d before changing their election procedures \u2013 were nullified by the Supreme Court in its 2013 Shelby County v Holder decision. (The court didn\u2019t strike down pre-clearance but said the law relied on an old formula that needed updating. Congress hasn\u2019t agreed on a new formula in the intervening years.) Soon after the ruling, states began erecting new barriers to voting, ranging from voter ID laws to signature-matching requirements. And those efforts ramped up this year with many Republican-controlled states proposing a raft of new voting restrictions, spurred on by former President Donald Trump\u2019s false claims of voter fraud in the 2020 election. A recent version of the new John Lewis Act would extend pre-clearance to states that have incurred multiple voting rights violations in the last 25 years \u2013 an attempt to get around the Supreme Court majority\u2019s concern in Shelby that states were being punished for decades-old misdeeds, rather than current discriminatory practices. Although a version of the Voting Rights Act rewrite passed the House in an earlier Congress, the John Lewis Act is not actually a bill right now. Committee hearings to fine-tune its provisions are planned as a precursor to its reintroduction in the House. Many Democrats and voting rights activists say both the For the People Act and the John Lewis bill are needed. Sen. Raphael Warnock, a Georgia Democrat on the ballot next year in a state that has upended its election rules, is urging passage of both measures. He recently described it this way to reporters, according to The Washington Post: \u201cThe John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act builds for us the fire station to protect us against future fires. But the house of democracy, as a result of these voter suppression bills all across the country, is on fire right now.\u201d Manchin wants Congress to focus on passing an update of the Voting Rights Act. In their letter Monday to House and Senate leaders, Manchin and Murkowski urged Congress to pass a version of the bill that could garner bipartisan support. \u201cInaction is not an option,\u201d they wrote. \u201cCongress must come together \u2013 just as we have done time and again \u2013 to reaffirm our longstanding bipartisan commitment to free, accessible, and secure elections for all.\u201d Manchin has offered some clues of what the bill should look like. He told ABC News last week that the pre-clearance provisions should extend to all 50 states and territories \u2013 not just those with a history of racial discrimination. That could help address another concern of the majority in the Supreme Court that gutted the Voting Rights Act in the first place: that the law imposed unequal burdens on states, by subjecting only some states to federal review. But the court\u2019s makeup has shifted even more to the right since 2013, with a new 6-3 conservative majority. And Manchin\u2019s insistence that Congress advance a new version of the Voting Rights Act may get nowhere unless he\u2019s willing to budge on the filibuster. After all, Murkowski was the only Republican in the Senate to co-sponsor the Voting Rights Act rewrite in the last Congress.",

            "article_content": "The Sunrise Movement, a youth-led climate activist group, on Monday announced its endorsement of former Ohio state Sen. Nina Turner, further bolstering her campaign\u2019s progressive support ahead of a special election for an open US House seat in Ohio. Turner, a top ally of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, is running to succeed former Rep. Marcia Fudge, whom the Senate confirmed in March as secretary of Housing and Urban Development, leaving an open congressional seat in Ohio\u2019s 11th District. The heavily Democratic northeast Ohio district will hold a special election in November, with a Democratic primary in August. Turner is running in a crowded Democratic field that includes Cuyahoga County Democratic Party Chairwoman Shontel Brown, who is also a member of the county council, and former Cleveland City Councilor Jeff Johnson. Sunrise is the latest in a line of progressive groups, including Justice Democrats and the Congressional Progressive Caucus PAC, to throw its support behind Turner. It\u2019s Sunrise\u2019s first congressional endorsement of 2021. \u201cOhio\u2019s 11th deserves a Congresswoman who will be a fierce advocate for the Green New Deal and progressive policies amidst the twin economic and climate crises we\u2019re facing. Nina is that leader \u2013 she understands what our communities are going through and is not afraid to stand up and work against the tide when it comes to helping her people,\u201d Shant\u00e9 Wolfe, electoral politics director for the Sunrise Movement, said in a statement. In response to the endorsement, Turner said, \u201cI\u2019m incredibly honored to have their endorsement. This is a group of young people and young adjacent people who have been on a mission to deal with climate chaos in this country and they have been bold about it.\u201d \u201cThe most important thing about the Sunrise Movement\u2019s endorsement is their vision. They understand that we must stop climate chaos right now for them and for generations yet unborn,\u201d she said. Turner \u2013 a former Cleveland city councilor who was appointed to the state senate in 2008 and reelected in 2010 before losing a race for secretary of state four years later \u2013 told CNN last week that she is committed to fighting for environmental and racial justice and believes in the need for a Green New Deal, the sweeping progressive climate proposal first brought to Congress in 2019 and championed by Sunrise. \u201cThe Green New Deal is multifaceted. Not only does it force us to answer the needs of mother Earth, it will also help to create jobs, and we need those jobs,\u201d said Turner, who noted that as a state senator she helped protect Lake Erie and co-sponsored a bill that helped exempt renewable energy facilities throughout Ohio from property taxes. \u201cThere is a racial justice component to the Green New Deal as well because we can really go into the communities that suffer the most and revitalize those communities in a way that will not only green those communities, but also get the jobs that we need,\u201d Turner added. Turner has also secured the backing of Sanders and a number of other progressive leaders including Reps. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Jamaal Bowman of New York, Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, Cori Bush of Missouri, Rashida Tlaib of Michigan and Pramila Jayapal of Washington. \u201cI\u2019ve gotten to know Nina Turner over the last five years. She deeply cares for working families and she has the heart to be an effective, unwavering fighter for them in Congress,\u201d Sanders said in December. Turner led Our Revolution, the outside group that grew out of Sanders\u2019 2016 campaign, before taking a leave of absence to become a co-chair of his 2020 run. She also served as a delegate for former President Barack Obama at the 2008 and 2012 Democratic National Conventions. Since its founding in 2017, Sunrise has backed a number of progressive primary challengers to Democratic incumbents, including Bush and Bowman. But the group also rallied behind Massachusetts Sen. Ed Markey, a co-author of the Green New Deal who emerged as the progressive favorite when former Massachusetts Rep. Joe Kennedy tried to end his decades in office.

            "article_content": "A version of this story appeared in CNN\u2019s What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here. The current drama in the GOP is the latest and most concrete evidence that the party is undergoing a very painful evolution. Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney, the daughter of a former vice president and a power in her own right, was excised from House leadership because she would not stop criticizing former President Donald Trump\u2019s continued lying about his 2020 election loss. House GOP picks Stefanik to replace Cheney as conference chair Republicans under Abraham Lincoln were the party that ended slavery. Southern states began seceding before he could be sworn in. Republicans under Dwight Eisenhower were the party of Cold Warriors, and then under Ronald Reagan they became the party of ever-smaller government. Republicans under Trump became the party that appealed to White supremacists and made protecting Confederate statues a campaign issue. Once the party specifically pushing the importance of the Constitution and the rule of law, it is now unacceptable for party leaders like Cheney to do anything but tolerate the attempted overthrow of valid election results \u2013 the bedrock principle that makes the American political system work. The result is that a major US political party is now wedded completely to an anti-democratic ideology. More than 100 Republicans who have had it are creating a new organization. They include George Conway, who helped run the Lincoln Project of disaffected Republicans bent on defeating Trump in 2016, but they are far from a mass movement. They aren\u2019t even really calling themselves a party. \u201cI don\u2019t think a third party necessarily works in the kind of political system we have,\u201d Conway told CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper on Wednesday night. \u201cBut there is a need for people who have a conservative to moderate point of view and want to believe in the rule of law and they need a place to go and a place where they can organize and support candidates that are consistent with that.\u201d The split between Republicans willing to stand for the truth and those happy to accept its attempted overthrow does not necessarily signify a complete reorienting of US parties, which have been moving and evolving since government leaders first split into factions in the early 1800s. US history is full of splinter parties and at least one complete party implosion, but the wreckage has always formed back into the two-party system. If you were to recap it as succinctly as possible, it might look like this: Early on, Federalist supporters of a stronger national government opposed Democratic-Republican defenders of the primacy of states. Federalists faded away and Democratic-Republicans split into Jacksonian Democrats and Whigs, who were united against Andrew Jackson, who they viewed as a wannabe king, but ultimately split apart over slavery. Along the way there were others, like the Know Nothings, which started as a secret society. Opposition to adding slave states in the West largely created the Republicans, who later faced splintering of their own with Bull Moose Progressives led by Theodore Roosevelt, who was frustrated at the direction his party took after he left the White House and was worried about ties between business and politics. That a faction of Republicans was once progressive seems ironic today, since Democrats like to be referred to as progressive, but that\u2019s only after they faced their own splinters, like Dixiecrats, old Southern segregationists in the 1940s. The South, and in particular White voters, was a growing part of Republicans\u2019 strategy. Now the South has gone from largely Democrat to Republican, although a changing population is upsetting that dynamic in some states. The North and the West Coast have moved from being dominated by Republicans to Democrats and what largely separates Democrats and Republicans is how involved the government should be in guaranteeing racial and economic equality. Ronald Brownstein writes this week for CNN abut how a shifting population is changing the current parties\u2019 fortunes. He says the decisive portion of the country in presidential elections has for decades been in the Rust Belt and the Midwest. No Republican has ever won the White House without Ohio, for instance. And that state seems to become more friendly to Republicans each year. But Democrats, who lost the White House in 2016 without Pennsylvania, Michigan and Wisconsin, won in 2020 by reclaiming them. \u201cContinuing a decades-long trend, the latest census numbers on total growth show a shift in population, and with it Electoral College votes and seats in the House of Representatives, away from Rust Belt states in the Northeast and upper Midwest \u2013 such as Ohio and Pennsylvania \u2013 toward Sun Belt states across the South and West \u2013 like North Carolina, Texas and Colorado,\u201d Brownstein writes, adding that with the changing population is coming a new politics. \u201cSimultaneously, the new census results on voting show that compared with the Rust Belt, the electorate in the Sun Belt is evolving more rapidly in a direction that benefits Democrats, with a growing share of non-White voters and a shrinking share of blue-collar Whites. That means the Sun Belt states, most of which leaned solidly Republican until recently, are likely to grow more competitive, even as their clout in the House and Electoral College steadily increases.\u201d Parties, then, can\u2019t help but change. That does not mean this is a realignment of their makeup: Even if their values have shifted, the party has for decades actively appealed to White Americans and religious conservatives. That has not changed, even if Trump has crossed a line by adding an anti-democratic paranoia to the mix. \u201cI don\u2019t view this as a realignment based on what we see in voter behavior,\u201d said Andra Gillespie, a political scientist at Emory, who said the old view of a realignment \u201cwould be characterized by a sort of jumbling up of the demographic components of a partisan coalition.\u201d Realignments are viewed in hindsight. And that is not exactly happening today, when we see slow shifts happening in real time. \u201cThey don\u2019t all happen at the same time and they don\u2019t happen over the course of one election,\u201d Gillespie said, pointing to the slow move of Black voters to the Democratic Party from the New Deal up to the 1960s, and then a specific moment \u2013 Barry Goldwater\u2019s selection as the GOP nominee in 1964 \u2013 that made them the most reliably Democratic voting group. But there is clearly something going on in the GOP, when a woman like Cheney, whose father was a Republican vice president, is essentially defrocked from her leadership position. There have been moments of parties splintering, such as when Democrats committed to states\u2019 rights and frustrated by civil rights legislation, just as Black Americans were shifting toward Democrats, tried to create their own Dixiecrat party. After talking to Gillespie I read more about Dixiecrats and came across a Clifford Berryman cartoon at the Library of Congress of Harry Truman plowing with a mule between Strom Thurmond, the Dixiecrat, and Henry Wallace, the Progressive. Despite a split on both wings, Truman still won in 1948. Republicans today are being pulled in opposite directions \u2013 Trump\u2019s anti-democratic tendencies vs. those who respect the outcome of the election. Dixiecrats won 39 electoral votes in the 1948 presidential election, all from Southern states. Those Southern states went back to Democrats four years later, but the rest of the country went Republican, and elected Eisenhower in a landslide. Twenty years later, in 1968, most of those Dixiecrat states went to George Wallace, the former segregationist Democrat running with the American Independent Party, handing Richard Nixon a narrow victory. The existing two-party system, as limited as it seems to anyone who wants more than a binary choice on Election Day, is still better than a one-party system \u2013 which inevitably becomes autocracy. \u201cWithout this clash of parties we don\u2019t have a capacity to move forward,\u201d said the author Jon Meacham during an appearance on CNN last week.",

            "article_content": "This past March, John Kavanagh, a Republican member of the Arizona House of Representatives, insisted that his antidemocratic position on voting rights was about election security. \u201cDemocrats value as many people as possible voting, and they\u2019re willing to risk fraud,\u201d the lawmaker said, rehashing former President Donald Trump\u2019s baseless tub-thumping about mass voter fraud in the November election. \u201cRepublicans are more concerned about fraud, so we don\u2019t mind putting security measures in that won\u2019t let everybody vote \u2013 but everybody shouldn\u2019t be voting.\u201d Then Kavanagh went even further, suggesting that not all eligible voters are of the same quality. \u201cNot everybody wants to vote, and if somebody is uninterested in voting, that probably means that they\u2019re totally uninformed on the issues,\u201d he added. \u201cQuantity is important, but we have to look at the quality of votes, as well.\u201d Everybody shouldn\u2019t be voting. The quality of votes. Kavanagh\u2019s support for voting restrictions is part of a much, much broader Republican effort to block access to the ballot box in the wake of President Joe Biden\u2019s victory over Trump \u2013 but it\u2019s also consistent with a long US history of political machinations intended to ensure power for White men and keep it at a distance for everyone else, most especially Black Americans. Lawmakers in 47 states have introduced 361 bills this year with provisions that restrict voting access, according to a March 24 tally from New York University Law School\u2019s Brennan Center for Justice. (For a rough comparison: The Brennan Center\u2019s tally in early February 2020 identified 35 restrictive bills in 15 states.) \u201cTo paraphrase George Orwell,\u201d Columbia University history professor Eric Foner told CNN, \u201cthere are those who feel that some voters are more equal than others. And that\u2019s an attitude being implemented right now in some legislatures.\u201d To the surprise of no one, much of this maneuvering disproportionately targets voters of color \u2013 in particular Black voters, who played a critical role in helping Democrats secure both the White House and the US Senate. For instance, in Georgia \u2013 a state that last year backed the Democratic presidential nominee for the first time since 1992 \u2013 the Republican-controlled legislature briefly considered, then dropped, a proposal that would\u2019ve limited early voting on Sundays, when Black churches traditionally hold their \u201csouls to the polls\u201d events, which are popular get-out-the-vote initiatives. The current assault on participatory democracy is disturbing not because it\u2019s new \u2013 but rather because the country has been here so many times before. US history is rife with examples, many of them violent, of attempts to quash Black voting power, stretching back to at least the mid-19th century. The crowning achievement of Reconstruction \u2013 the period that by some accounts began in about 1863, toward the end of the Civil War \u2013 was the ratification of the 13th, 14th and 15th Amendments, which together ended slavery, secured all persons due process and equal protection of law, and extended the right to vote to Black men. Even during this groundbreaking time, Black Americans\u2019 hard-fought rights remained a point of fierce dispute. \u201cIt must be acknowledged that in the progress of nations, Negroes have shown less capacity for government than any other race of people,\u201d President Andrew Johnson, a Democrat, railed in an 1867 message to Congress, less than three years before the ratification of the 15th Amendment. \u201cNo independent government of any form has ever been successful in their hands. On the contrary, wherever they have been left to their own devices, they have shown a constant tendency to relapse into barbarism.\u201d Many White Americans didn\u2019t stop at racist invective. Most infamously in the South, there was also violence that challenged the newfound political strength of Black men. One notable example occurred in 1868. In the spring of that year, Louisiana voters ratified a state constitution that enfranchised Black men. Many White people in Opelousas, a city in St. Landry Parish, didn\u2019t like that, though. Over the course of about two weeks beginning on September 28, White men in the area killed around 250 people, mostly Black Americans. The reason: to terrorize Black voters (and anyone who supported Reconstruction efforts) in the run-up to the November presidential contest between Ulysses S. Grant \u2013 whose incarnation of the Republican Party backed legislation supporting Black Americans \u2013 and Democrat Horatio Seymour, pitched as the \u201cWhite man\u2019s candidate.\u201d The brutality had its intended effect. Though Grant became the country\u2019s 18th president, the former Union Army leader didn\u2019t receive a single vote in St. Landry Parish. (It\u2019s worth remembering that today\u2019s Republicans are the contemporary successors to the 19th-century Democrats. In fits and starts over much of the 20th century, the two parties realigned, propelled largely by the matter of civil rights reforms.) Such political violence continued with depressing regularity. Another key example came on April 13, 1873, when a mob of about 150 armed White men in Colfax, the seat of Grant Parish, Louisiana, killed between 60 and 150 Black Americans who had taken over the local courthouse and been defending it from possible Democratic seizure following the state\u2019s controversial 1872 gubernatorial election. \u201cThe Colfax Massacre taught many lessons, including the lengths to which some opponents of Reconstruction would go to regain their accustomed authority,\u201d Foner documents in his 1988 book, \u201cReconstruction: America\u2019s Unfinished Revolution, 1863-1877.\u201d As in 1868, power was at the heart of the issue. Most of the attackers were ex-Confederate soldiers, and many of them also belonged to the Ku Klux Klan. Through arson and murder, the group fought to bolster White supremacist policies and keep formerly enslaved people away from the polls \u2013 out of the polity. By the end of the 19th century, it was clear that there were other methods for restricting access to the ballot box. Governments in the South, in complete violation of the 15th Amendment, began to take away Black men\u2019s right to vote \u2013 not explicitly but obliquely, via an elaborate mix of, among other things, registration requirements, poll taxes, literacy tests and understanding clauses (where a would-be voter had to prove to a registrar that he understood the state\u2019s constitution; amazingly, Black men never seemed to understand it). The Reconstruction governments were gone. This was a new era of racial subjugation, captured in the term \u201cJim Crow.\u201d \u201cThe plan,\u201d Emory University African American studies professor Carol Anderson writes in her 2018 book, \u201cOne Person, No Vote: How Voter Suppression Is Destroying Our Democracy,\u201d \u201cwas to take years of state-sponsored \u2018trickery and fraud\u2019 and transform those schemes into laws that would keep Blacks away from the voting booth, disenfranchise as many as possible and, most important, ensure that no African American would ever assume real political power again.\u201d In other words, while the approach evolved \u2013 became just slightly less egregious \u2013 the aim never wavered. Crucially, political violence remained rampant. It underpinned the Jim Crow racial regime. On November 10, 1898, a White mob overthrew a legitimately elected biracial government in Wilmington, North Carolina, which had a flourishing Black community, and installed White supremacists. As many as 60 people were killed. Also lost during the massacre was the progressive Black newspaper The Daily Record; the horde set the building aflame. \u201cThe Constitution of the United States contemplated a government to be carried on by an enlightened people,\u201d Democrat Alfred Waddell, who led the coup d\u2019\u00e9tat, said the day before the assault, reading from the so-called White Declaration of Independence. \u201cIts framers did not anticipate the enfranchisement of an ignorant population of African origin. \u2026 We will no longer be ruled, and will never again be ruled by men of African origin.\u201d Writing for Time magazine last year, journalist David Zucchino, author of the 2020 book, \u201cWilmington\u2019s Lie: The Murderous Coup of 1898 and the Rise of White Supremacy,\u201d fit the episode into a broader story of political turmoil. \u201cThe 1898 coup capped a months-long White Supremacy Campaign in North Carolina designed to strip Black men of the vote and remove them from public office forever,\u201d he explained. It wasn\u2019t until the mid-20th-century civil rights movement \u2013 when President Lyndon B. Johnson, a Democrat, signed into law the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and the Voting Rights Act (VRA) of 1965 \u2013 that there was something of a reversal of systematically preventing Black Americans across the South from staking a claim to US democracy through the ballot box. Notably, there was also what University of Arkansas political science professors Angie Maxwell and Todd Shields call the \u201cLong Southern Strategy,\u201d which was a series of decisions on religion, race and feminism that Republicans made in an effort to court White Southern voters. While the strategy began in earnest in the \u201960s, political leaders reformed it over the course of several decades. Former Republican strategist Lee Atwater summarized the racial dimension of the strategy the following way. \u201cYou start out in 1954 by saying, \u2018N****r, n****r, n****r.\u2019 By 1968, you can\u2019t say \u2018n***r\u2019 \u2013 that hurts you, backfires,\u201d he said in 1981. \u201cSo you say stuff like \u2018forced busing,\u2019 \u2018states\u2019 rights\u2019 and all that stuff. You\u2019re getting so abstract now (that) you\u2019re talking about cutting taxes. And all these things you\u2019re talking about are totally economic things, and a byproduct of them is (that) Blacks get hurt worse than Whites.\u201d The progress achieved during the civil rights movement, which many historians refer to as the Second Reconstruction, is in jeopardy \u2013 and has been for some time. For instance, in 2013, the US Supreme Court\u2019s 5-4 decision in the landmark case Shelby County v. Holder freed jurisdictions with histories of racial discrimination in voting from having to gain federal approval, called \u201cpreclearance,\u201d before changing their election laws. By doing away with direct federal oversight of election laws, the Court empowered wannabe John C. Calhouns and George Wallaces. Chief Justice John Roberts, who delivered the majority opinion, backed the decision by writing that \u201cracial disparity in (voter registration and turnout numbers in the covered jurisdictions) was compelling evidence justifying the preclearance remedy and the coverage formula. There is no longer such a disparity.\u201d Not everyone on the Court agreed. Underscoring the wrongheadedness of the decision, the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg wrote in her powerful dissent that \u201cthrowing out preclearance when it has worked and is continuing to work to stop discriminatory changes is like throwing away your umbrella in a rainstorm because you are not getting wet.\u201d The fallout from Shelby County ended up illustrating Ginsburg\u2019s point, not Roberts\u2019. The decision paved the way for more restrictive voting laws. \u201cOne of the lessons, unfortunately, was what can happen to your rights in the hands of a conservative Supreme Court,\u201d Foner told CNN. Of course, the battle over voting rights isn\u2019t limited to one Court decision. Currently, Arizona\u2019s attorney general and its Republican Party are the plaintiffs in Brnovich v. Democratic National Committee, a case that, as my CNN colleague Joan Biskupic has explained, could allow the new 6-3, conservative-liberal bench to continue chipping away at the VRA. And across the country, Republicans are shepherding a variety of draconian bills through state legislatures, bills that would, among other things, shrink the number of early-voting days, impose stricter voter identification requirements and limit ballot drop boxes, all of which are measures that observers say would disproportionately disadvantage Black voters and contribute to the predominantly White conservative doom loop. The avowed reason for proposing such legislation is election security. But that explanation is little more than a canard, in light of the fact that Americans weren\u2019t really worried about election security until Republicans started talking about it, and Republicans didn\u2019t start talking about it until they started losing recent elections. \u201cThere\u2019s a growing trend on the right in which any election they lose is dismissed as illegitimate,\u201d Princeton University history professor Kevin M. Kruse said. \u201cThe proponents of voter suppression have created a fiction in which they are the victims of mass voter fraud. They are never able to provide any proof of that, but they believe it all the same.\u201d But voting rights advocates aren\u2019t taking all of this lying down. HR 1 (the For the People Act) and HR 4 (the Voting Rights Advancement Act) are two bills working their way through the US Congress that could help check Republicans\u2019 voter suppression efforts. The former, which the Democratic-led House passed in March, would expand voting via policies such as automatic and same-day voter registration. The latter would revise parts of the VRA that were gutted as a result of the 2013 Shelby County decision. Both bills, however, face long odds in the 50-50 Senate at least in part because of the filibuster, a tactic that\u2019s long been used to thwart civil rights progress and bolster White supremacy. In his maiden floor speech, newly elected Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock \u2013 who, along with Sen. Jon Ossoff, also a Democrat, was declared a winner in Georgia\u2019s January 5 runoff elections on the same day that a Confederate flag-waving mob laid siege to the US Capitol \u2013 placed the contemporary battle over voting rights, and over Black political power, into a wider historical context. \u201cWe are witnessing right now a massive and unabashed assault on voting rights unlike anything we\u2019ve ever seen since the Jim Crow era,\u201d Warnock said in March. \u201cThis is Jim Crow in new clothes.\u201d Warnock\u2019s focus on the past makes good sense. After all, \u201cif one cannot use the past, one cannot function in the present,\u201d James Baldwin argues in \u201cNothing Personal,\u201d his 1964 book with Richard Avedon. \u201cAnd so one can never be free.\u201d The task today is to use the past \u2013 to understand its racial hierarchies and how they persist \u2013 in order to create a tomorrow in which everyone is equal.

            "article_content": "On Thursday, Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis signed an elections bill that makes it more difficult to vote. The Florida law is part of a cross-country Republican effort \u2013 in the wake of President Donald Trump\u2019s lies about the integrity of the 2020 election \u2013 to impose new restrictions on voter access.   DeSantis said Thursday that the new law will make Florida elections more secure. But Florida elections were already highly secure: DeSantis boasted in November about how well the 2020 general election had gone, saying Florida was now being seen as \u201cthe state that did it right and that other states should emulate,\u201d while Republican Secretary of State Laurel Lee, a DeSantis appointee, said in December that her department had \u201csuccessfully administered three safe, secure and orderly elections\u201d in 2020. County elections supervisors from both parties have criticized various provisions of the new law. Voting rights activists, some of whom have already filed lawsuits, say the new law is an undemocratic effort to suppress the votes of racial minorities and others. We can\u2019t list every provision of a 48-page bill. But since elections laws tend to be the subject of furious political spin, here is a simple look at 10 of the law\u2019s most significant provisions. The law reduces the number of hours that ballot drop boxes can be made available to voters. The law says drop boxes can only be used during early voting hours, other than boxes located at an office of a local elections supervisor. This means that, except at supervisors\u2019 offices, drop boxes are allowed for a maximum of 12 hours per day. Previous Florida law did not limit the hours drop box could be open, though the DeSantis administration sent out controversial instructions in October 2020 that tried to insist on hours limits. The new requirement to match drop box hours to early voting hours, except for boxes at supervisors\u2019 offices, also means reductions in the number of days the boxes can be open. For example, boxes not at supervisors\u2019 offices can no longer be open on Election Day or the day before, since Florida ends its early voting period two days before Election Day. The law also requires that each drop box be monitored in person by an employee of the supervisor\u2019s office; previous law only said they had to be \u201csecure.\u201d (Drop boxes are very secure without in-person monitoring; many counties around the country use video surveillance.) And the law creates a vague requirement about where counties need to put their drop boxes, saying boxes \u201cmust be geographically located so as to provide all voters in the county with an equal opportunity to cast a ballot, insofar as is practicable.\u201d One Republican elections supervisor, Alan Hays of Lake County, told CNN that he has \u201cno idea\u201d what that wording means. The law says that if \u201cany\u201d drop box is left accessible to voters in a manner that violates the new rules, the supervisor is subject to a civil penalty of up to $25,000. The law requires Florida voters to do extra labor to obtain mail-in ballots. Under the previous law, a voter had to file just one application to get a mail-in ballot for every election during two election cycles. In other words, under the previous law, a Florida resident could have filed an application in 2021 to get a mail-in ballot for both the 2022 congressional midterms and the 2024 presidential election. Now, a voter\u2019s application gets them a mail-in ballot for a single election cycle. So an application filed in 2021 would obtain a 2022 ballot but not a 2024 ballot as well. The new law does include a grandfather clause. Voters who filed applications before the 2020 election will still get mail-in ballots for the 2022 election as previously planned. The law requires voters to provide a form of identification \u2013 their driver\u2019s license number, Florida identification card number, or last four digits of their Social Security number \u2013 to obtain a mail-in ballot. (Florida already had identification requirements for in-person voting.) Under the old law, a voter could file a change of address by calling an elections supervisor and providing their date of birth. Now, the voter making that call has to provide both their date of birth and one of the above kinds of identification. The law makes it a first-degree misdemeanor to possess or deliver more than two mail-in ballots per election, other than a voter\u2019s own ballot and the ballots of \u201cimmediate\u201d family members. In other words, it is now a crime for someone in Florida to drop off the sealed ballots of, say, two elderly neighbors and a disabled cousin, or two nieces and a nephew who work long hours and don\u2019t have cars. (There is an exception for ballots collected during supervised voting periods at nursing homes and assisted living facilities.) DeSantis said this provision is aimed at preventing political operatives from collecting large numbers of ballots to submit, a practice DeSantis and other Republicans describe as \u201cballot harvesting.\u201d The previous law already prohibited people from getting paid to deliver more than two ballots other than their own and those of immediate family members, but that previous law let volunteers deliver an unlimited quantity of ballots. The law says state and local governments are not allowed to send a voter a mail-in ballot unless the voter has requested one. (There are exceptions for ballots sent to overseas voters and voters with disabilities, and for local referenda.) In 2020, because of the coronavirus pandemic, some state officials around the country decided to send out mail-in ballots to registered voters without requiring a request. The bill prohibits agencies and elections officials from accepting a donation from an individual or non-governmental entity to fund election-related expenses, voter education, voter outreach or voter registration. (There is an exception for donations of space to be used as a voting site.) Similar prohibitions are being promoted by Republicans in other states. They appear to be, at least in part, a response to hundreds of millions of dollars in 2020 donations from Facebook chief executive officer Mark Zuckerberg and his wife Priscilla Chan. Some Republicans called the donations inappropriate, while some local elections officials said the money was needed to fund changes necessitated by the pandemic. The law broadens Florida\u2019s restrictions on the \u201csolicitation\u201d of voters within 150 feet of voting locations. The law adds drop boxes to the list of voting locations covered by the 150-foot no-solicitation zone. And the new law says illegal solicitation in the 150-foot zone includes not only seeking votes, seeking signatures and handing out leaflets but \u201cengaging in any activity with the intent to influence or effect of influencing a voter.\u201d The new law does not explicitly ban people from giving out food and drink to voters within the 150-foot zone. But since even giving out a cup of water might well be perceived by some as an activity with the intent to influence a voter, the law could deter people from providing such refreshments within the zone. (The law says nonpartisan staff or volunteers working with local elections supervisors are permitted to hand items to voters.) The law requires any third-party organization that conducts voter registration work to tell residents that the organization might not deliver their application on time for the next election, and to also explain to residents that they can submit a registration form on their own rather than relying on the group to send it in. Voter registration groups say this mandatory warning will reduce trust in their efforts and make it more difficult for them to get people registered. The law says that a candidate, party official, political committee official or a designate of these people has to be given \u201creasonable access,\u201d if they request it, to \u201creview or inspect ballot materials\u201d \u2013 before votes are counted. The law says these ballot materials include \u201cvoter certificates on vote-by-mail envelopes, cure affidavits, corresponding comparison signatures, duplicate ballots, and corresponding originals.\u201d Hays, the Republican supervisor in Lake County, noted that a single ballot might include more than 15 different races. He said it doesn\u2019t make sense to allow so many people into the room with elections staffers while they are doing critical high-intensity work. \u201cThe worst possible time to have a conflict in an elections office is in the last three weeks of an election,\u201d Hays said. He said he intends to define \u201creasonable access\u201d as allowing the partisan observers to watch the proceedings from outside the room \u2013 through large interior windows and on a 55-inch television screen. \u201cWe have nothing to hide but we will not allow the administration of the election to be interrupted,\u201d he said. The new law eliminates the previous requirement that an election be held to replace a local official who resigns to run for another office. Under the new law, the governor gets the power to fill these \u201cresign-to-run\u201d vacancies. This provision may have an immediate impact, since county commissioners from heavily Democratic Broward County are among the candidates running to fill the congressional vacancy left by the April death of Rep. Alcee Hastings.",

            "article_content": "Weeks before Elizabeth Warren launched her first senatorial campaign, she made a call to a woman she said was a longtime Democratic activist in Massachusetts. She recalls telling the woman she was going to run for Senate. \u201cMartha lost,\u201d Warren says the woman responded, according to her new memoir. The woman was referencing Martha Coakley, who was the first female Senate nominee of a major party in Massachusetts, but lost two statewide campaigns. \u201cOof,\u201d Warren responded. That\u2019s just one of many anecdotes the Massachusetts senator recalls in her new memoir out this week where she reflects on gender and loss in the 2020 presidential campaign.

I didn\u2019t need to be heralded as the First Something. I just wanted a chance to fight for the things I cared about \u2013 economic opportunity, racial justice, halting climate change, combating Washington corruption, improving our education system. I had been talking about these issues for a long time.\u201d She goes on to write: \u201cBut there\u2019s always another possibility, a much more painful one: in this moment, against this president, in this field of candidates, maybe I just wasn\u2019t good enough to reassure the voters, to bring along the doubters, to embolden the hopeful.\u201d Throughout her memoir \u2013 the third book Warren has written as a politician \u2013 she reflects on the role her gender played in her presidential campaign. While she never directly blamed sexism for losing the nomination, it\u2019s a theme that comes up again and again in anecdotes of her life that are intertwined with decisions she\u2019s made or views she has on issues. In one, she recounts thinking as she lay in bed after her first day fundraising for her presidential bid, \u201cI wondered whether anyone said to Bernie Sanders when he asked for their support, \u2018Gore lost, so how can you win?\u2019 I wondered whether anyone said to Joe Biden, \u2018Kerry lost, so clearly America just isn\u2019t ready for a man to be president.\u2019\u201d She added: \u201cI tried to laugh, but the joke didn\u2019t seem very funny.\u201d Warren sprinkles commentary about her then-2020 rivals throughout the memoir. She calls Sanders \u201cfearless and determined\u201d and Biden \u201ca good leader and fundamentally decent man.\u201d With Sanders specifically, she referenced him telling her a woman couldn\u2019t win the election. (Sanders denied the characterization of that conversation in a statement to CNN at the time.) \u201cThe news caused a stir. But the question of whether a woman could win the presidency was clearly on voters\u2019 minds, and it would come up in debates and town halls,\u201d she said. \u201cWhen asked, I always told an upbeat story about why I believed success was within our grasp, but I was under no illusion \u2013 I knew that winning would be an uphill battle.\u201d There is one presidential rival Warren does not compliment in her memoir \u2013 Michael Bloomberg. Warren recalls her first debate performance against the former New York City mayor and billionaire where she felt he was not listening to her attacks against him. \u201cLike so many women in so many settings, I found myself wondering if he had even heard me,\u201d she wrote. Many attributed Warren\u2019s debate performance that night in Las Vegas as to why Bloomberg dropped out of the race. But Warren reflects on what critics said about what she told Bloomberg that night \u2013 about how she came off, according to one analyst, as \u201cmean and angry.\u201d \u201cAnd there it was, the same damn remark made about every woman who ever stood up for herself and threw a punch. Repeat after me: fighting hard is \u2018not a good look,\u2019\u201d she wrote. Warren also goes into detail about several parts of her past, including a story she often told on the campaign trail about being fired from her teaching job when she was pregnant. A portion of her memoir is devoted to memorializing her brother Don Reed Herring, who died of coronavirus last year and whose death, she wrote, \u201cdidn\u2019t need to happen,\u201d blaming the Trump administration\u2019s handling of the pandemic. Warren also acknowledges her claims to Native American heritage as a \u201cbad mistake.\u201d \u201cI should never have identified as Native American. I\u2019ve never been a citizen of a tribal nation. Tribal nations \u2013 and only tribal nations \u2013 determine who their citizens are,\u201d she wrote. Still, Warren\u2019s memoir is not just about her past, but about what she wants to continue to do in the future, she wrote. \u201cThis book is not a campaign memoir. It is not a rehash of big public events. It\u2019s a book about the fight that lies ahead,\u201d she wrote. \u201cIt\u2019s about the plans we need \u2013 no surprise there! \u2013 but it\u2019s about much more than plans. It\u2019s about the passion and commitment that underlie those plans, and the human connection that will keep us in this fight until we see real change.\u201d",

            "article_content": "President Joe Biden laid out his ambitious plan to remake the social contract between government and citizens during his first address to a joint session of Congress Wednesday night. Appealing to both patriotism and morality, he told Americans they should expect to get more out of their government and that those who are most successful should have to pay more in. The single most important sentence in Joe Biden's big speech His vision \u2013 for more government money to pay for child care, community college, health care, and infrastructure like roads and bridges and the power grid \u2013 would add up to trillions in new spending, but he argued we need to invest to prime ourselves for the battle of ideals \u2013 democracy vs. autocracy \u2013 with China and Russia. \u201cAutocrats think that democracy can\u2019t compete in the 21st century with autocracies because it takes too long to get consensus,\u201d Biden said, speaking about China\u2019s Xi Jinping. \u201cTo win that competition for the future, in my view, we also need to make a once-in-a-generation investment in our families and our children.\u201d I went line-by-line through the speech and annotated it. Read it here. The scope of Biden\u2019s plan \u2013 built on progressive goals for a more active and generous government \u2013 is in line with Franklin Delano Roosevelt\u2019s New Deal, which not only got the country rebuilt during the Great Depression but created Social Security so older Americans would not be in poverty. It\u2019s no less ambitious than Lyndon B. Johnson\u2019s Great Society, which gave older Americans guaranteed health care. And it builds on the legacy of Biden\u2019s former boss Barack Obama, who tried to extend health benefits to the rest of the country through the Affordable Care Act.   For an appraisal of similarities between Biden and Roosevelt, read this CNN Opinion by David Gergen, who advised four presidents from both parties. There are many differences between Biden and those other presidents, but there\u2019s one key distinction that could stand in the way of any massive and meaningful permanent legislation, and it\u2019s this: Biden\u2019s trying to build a big time legacy with a small time majority. Each of those other Democratic presidents had a massive majority in the Senate \u2013 60 or more \u2013 that helped them change the safety net with support in both parties. Social Security: 69 Senate Democrats, 76 total \u201cyes\u201d votes, including 16 Republicans. Roosevelt came to office in 1933 after a landslide win. His Democrats gained another nine seats in the 1934 Midterm elections. There were 69 Democratic senators when Social Security was passed. Medicare: 68 Senate Democrats, 70 total Senate \u201cyes\u201d votes, including 13 Republicans. Johnson came to office after John F. Kennedy\u2019s assassination at a similar moment of brewing racial upheaval. He beat filibusters of civil rights legislation and almost simultaneously got Medicare passed, in 1965. He did it with a 68-seat Senate majority. Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act was nearly defeated when Democrats lost a 60-seat majority after the death of Masschusetts Sen. Edward Kennedy, JFK\u2019s younger brother. But that example is more modern and it has everything to do with overcoming the filibuster. The time before cloture and filibuster took over. Neither Medicare nor Social Security was the subject of an official filibuster in the Senate, even though back then an even smaller minority could have destroyed either bill. The practice was basically nonexistent in the 1930s. There were no \u201ccloture\u201d filings to limit debate in all of 1935. Today nearly everything requires \u201ccloture\u201d to get around the threat of filibuster. In 1965, civil rights legislation was filibustered, but not Medicare. (There were a grand total of 7 cloture filings in 1965. There have been 37 in the 100 days of Biden\u2019s presidency.) That doesn\u2019t mean passing Medicare was easy. Princeton history professor Julian Zelizer wrote about the Senate jockeying in The New Yorker back in 2015: \u201cThe passage of Medicare and Medicaid, which shattered the barriers that had separated the federal government and the health-care system, was no less contentious than the recent debates about the Affordable Care Act,\u201d he wrote, although back then Republicans were actively part of the debate. Where is the bipartisanship? Both Medicare and Social Security ultimately passed with large bipartisan majorities, something Biden \u2013 and I feel comfortable making this most obvious prediction \u2013 is unlikely to get. We know that Republicans will claim he\u2019s not being bipartisan. We know that if he waits for Republican votes, he won\u2019t get anything done. Changing the country without a big majority. What\u2019s left for Biden is to use is bare majority and exploit Senate rules for budget \u201creconciliation,\u201d as he did for his Covid relief bill and as Republicans did for their tax cuts bill under Trump. He\u2019ll need complete Democratic unity to work this way and it\u2019s clear West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin, the Senate\u2019s most important Democrat, has little appetite to enable new spending. Landslides lead to legislation. Another key difference between Biden\u2019s efforts now and the social programs of the 1930s and 1960s is in the strength of FDR and LBJ\u2019s election wins. FDR won the vast majority of states in 1932, except the Northeast, and he bucked the trend of an incumbent losing power by gaining nine Senate seats in 1934. Months later, he was signing Social Security into law. In 1964, Johnson won the vast majority of the states, except in the South. Zelizer told me in an email that Medicare was a campaign issue that year between Johnson and Republican Barry Goldwater, who opposed Medicare. Republicans were terrified of being like him so they started to compromise,\u201d Zelizer said, although he added there are other key differences, including the growing cost of those previous programs. \u201cBut Biden is showing that a lot is still possible if you can keep every Democrat on the same page and are willing to use tools like reconciliation,\u201d he said. Can Biden win a stronger majority? 2022 is closer than you think, and picking up a workable Senate majority, would help him be less reliant on the whims of Manchin. A filibuster-proof majoirty seems like pipe dream, but anything more than their current 50 would be a step in the right direction for Democrats, who also have to hold a slim House majority. There\u2019s little room for either party to move. Of the 10 Senate seats most likely to flip, according to CNN\u2019s Simone Pathe, 6 are held by Republicans and four are held by Democrats. Only two of the at-risk seats \u2013 Republican Sen. Ron Johnson in Wisconsin and retiring Republican Sen. Pat Toomey in Pennsylvania \u2013 are in a state won by the opposing party in the presidential election. The writing on the wall, at least for now, is that the Senate majority in 2023, whoever holds it, will be slim. Again. That leaves Biden\u2019s hopes pinned to keeping Democrats united and hoping for the miracle of Republicans will work with him, or exploiting loopholes in Senate rules if he wants a Roosevelt-style rewrite of the social safety net.",

            "article_content": "Brendan Hunt \u2013 whose father is a retired judge and who allegedly threatened the lives of House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, now-Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer and Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez \u2013 was found guilty of one count of threatening to assault or murder US officials by a jury in Brooklyn federal court on Wednesday, according to the Eastern District of New York. Federal prosecutors charged and tried Hunt, the son of retired New York City family court judge John Hunt. Brendan Hunt will be sentenced in June and faces up to 10 years in prison, the Eastern District said in a statement. Hunt took the stand in his own defense on Tuesday, telling the court that he didn\u2019t really mean what he said in videos and messaging apps about killing elected officials. Hunt testified that he didn\u2019t think his rhetoric about killing elected officials could bear real penal consequences because he\u2019d seen the prevalence of \u201ckill Trump\u201d rhetoric, especially from celebrities. Mark Lesko, the acting US attorney for the Eastern District of New York, praised the trial\u2019s outcome on Wednesday. \u201cWith today\u2019s verdict, the defendant is now a convicted felon, not for his repugnant, racist rants, but because he threatened to attack and kill members of Congress to prevent them from carrying out their constitutional duties, and that is a federal crime,\u201d Lesko said in a statement. \u201cThis Office will not tolerate threats of violence against public officials who are entrusted with upholding the Constitution.\u201d Prosecutors argued that Hunt had posted videos of himself at his Queens home in January discussing the January 6 riot at the US Capitol, threatening to kill senators and encouraging others to go back to the Capitol on Inauguration Day and take their guns. In a Facebook account registered to HuntBrendan, prosecutors said, Hunt posted his praise in December for people who have fought back against Covid-19 mitigation protocols \u2013 and praised violence against police but also said people should instead \u201cgo after a high value target\u201d like Pelosi, Schumer or Ocasio-Cortez. The prosecution posed questions during the cross-examination about his academic history and intelligence, repeatedly establishing his adulthood. Hunt said he\u2019s a \u201cpretty immature 37-year-old\u201d and after reflection during his stint in prison since his January arrest, he regrets the language he used. \u201cI had a lot of time to think in prison. I\u2019ve been in prison for three months. A lot of that in solitary confinement,\u201d Hunt said. \u201cAnd I had to come to grips with the fact that a lot of my language was very inappropriate, it was irresponsible, careless and immature in a lot of ways.\u201d He blamed his behavior partly on marijuana and excessive drinking while being increasingly isolated in his apartment. \u201cI had made that video one night when I had been having a bunch of beers, smoking a little weed, taken a few bong rips, and I kind of did this spur of the moment video, just spewing out some rhetoric, and I didn\u2019t think anything was wrong at the time,\u201d Hunt said. \u201cI thought it was sort of amusing in a way. And then a day later I checked back into it with a bit of a sober mind and saw that it wasn\u2019t really sparking the dialogue that I had hoped to get going.\u201d Prosecutors previously showed the jury text messages that Hunt allegedly sent to his father last November, around the time of the presidential election. In the string of messages, Hunt allegedly mentioned Adolf Hitler and said the American people would support then-President Donald Trump if he overrode the democratic process like Hitler did to remain president despite the election looking like it was leaning in now-President Joe Biden\u2019s favor. When asked about discriminatory rants to his father in private text messages, Hunt testified that he purposely said extreme statements to anger his dad but doesn\u2019t actually hold racist beliefs. \u201cI might have said a racial slur once or twice other times in my life. But that\u2019s not something that I believe,\u201d Hunt said in court. \u201cThat\u2019s not something that I ascribe to. And it was said to kind of get a rise out of him and get him mad at me almost to see if he would even criticize me in any way.\u201d The defense and prosecution gave their closing arguments Tuesday afternoon. The entire trial process took eight full days in court.",

            "article_content": "Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina criticized President Joe Biden and argued he is failing to deliver on his promises in the GOP rebuttal to the President\u2019s first address to a joint session of Congress on Wednesday evening. \u201cPresident Biden promised you a specific kind of leadership,\u201d Scott said in his remarks. \u201cHe promised to unite a nation, to lower the temperature, to govern for all Americans no matter how we voted.\u201d While rebuttals typically offer the opposing party a chance to critique the President\u2019s message, Scott\u2019s speech directly called out Biden and his party, as the Republican senator touched on a wide range of issues, offering up praise for the Trump administration and slamming Democrats as divisive. \u201cOur nation is starving for more than empty platitudes,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need policies and progress that bring us closer together. But three months in, the actions of the President and his party are pulling us further and further apart.\u201d Scott, the only Black Republican in the Senate, was selected by his party\u2019s leadership to deliver their response, giving him a prominent national platform to speak to the country and the opportunity to draw a contrast between the GOP and Biden\u2019s agenda. Scott waded into an array of hot-button policy debates and issues, including infrastructure, voting rights, policing reform and racism and discrimination, saying at one point that \u201cAmerica is not a racist country.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m an African American who has voted in the South my entire life. I take voting rights personally,\u201d he said, offering a defense of Republicans who pushed through changes to Georgia\u2019s election laws that impose significant new obstacles to voting and gives the Republican-controlled state government new power to assert control over the conduct of elections. Read Republican Sen. Tim Scott's response to Biden's address to Congress \u201cRepublicans support making it easier to vote and harder to cheat,\u201d Scott said. Scott used his remarks to speak in deeply personal terms during the speech, saying, \u201cI have experienced the pain of discrimination,\u201d though he cited his experience as a critique of left-leaning politics. \u201cI get called \u2018Uncle Tom\u2019 and the N-word \u2014 by progressives, by liberals,\u201d he said, \u201cBelieve me, I know firsthand our healing is not finished.\u201d In his remarks, Scott criticized higher education institutions as well as businesses for \u201cdoubling down on the divisions we\u2019ve worked so hard to heal\u201d and profiting off of racial politics. \u201cFrom colleges to corporations to our culture, people are making money and gaining power by pretending we haven\u2019t made any progress at all,\u201d he said. Later he added, \u201cYou know this stuff is wrong. Hear me clearly: America is not a racist country.\u201d Scott credited the Trump administration with the development of effective vaccines to address Covid-19 and cited school closures during the pandemic as a key issue. \u201cThe coronavirus is on the run. Thanks to Operation Warp Speed and the Trump administration, our country is flooded with safe and effective vaccines. Thanks to our bipartisan work last year, job openings are rebounding,\u201d he said. \u201cSo why do we feel so divided and anxious?\u201d He criticized school closures, a hot-button issue amid the ongoing pandemic. \u201cLocking vulnerable kids out of the classroom is locking adults out of their future,\u201d he said. \u201cOur public schools should have reopened months ago. Other countries did. Private and religious schools did. Science has shown for months that schools are safe.\u201d Scott also slammed Biden\u2019s sweeping infrastructure push, saying that Republicans are ready and willing to work to advance traditional infrastructure priorities, but that Democrats \u201cwon\u2019t even build bridges to build bridges\u201d and instead are trying to jam through a liberal wish list of unrelated agenda items. The Republican rebuttal comes as Scott has been seen as a key negotiator on Capitol Hill, known for working across the aisle and being praised by Democrats. Scott has served in the Senate since 2013 and previously served in the House of Representatives representing his state\u2019s 1st Congressional District. In the wake of George Floyd\u2019s death last year, he drafted legislation aimed at overhauling policing, an effort that ultimately failed on the Senate floor. Now he\u2019s at the center of a new bipartisan effort. Scott\u2019s discussions over a bipartisan Senate bill overhauling policing with Democratic Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey and Democratic Rep. Karen Bass of California, the author of the House-passed George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, have intensified in recent weeks. Their goal remains crafting a compromise bill, according to a source familiar with the talks. During his speech Wednesday, Scott said, \u201cIn 2015, after the shooting of Walter Scott, I wrote a bill to fund body cameras. Last year, after the deaths of Breonna Taylor and George Floyd, I built an even bigger police reform proposal. But my Democratic colleagues blocked it.\u201d \u201cI extended an olive branch. I offered amendments. But Democrats used the filibuster to block the debate from even happening. My friends across the aisle seemed to want the issue more than they wanted a solution,\u201d he lamented. \u201cBut I\u2019m still working. I\u2019m hopeful that this will be different,\u201d he said. A new political environment in a non-election year and an increasing sense of urgency spurred by a number of police shooting deaths across the country have given this effort a better chance of bipartisan success. But key sticking points remain \u2013 a challenge that will put the ability of the lead negotiators to forge compromise to the test. This story and headline have been updated with additional developments Wednesday. CNN\u2019s Daniel Dale, Diane Gallagher and Ali Zaslav contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Sen. Tim Scott, a key player in the bipartisan congressional effort to overhaul policing, will step into the national spotlight Wednesday, handpicked by GOP leadership to give the Republican rebuttal to President Joe Biden\u2019s first address to a joint session of Congress. The speech offers Scott a national platform and a chance to speak to many Americans for perhaps the first time at a moment in which he is playing a critical role in the effort to weave together a policing bill that can pass the narrowly divided US Senate. While Scott is keeping many of the details of his speech to himself, the South Carolina Republican said he\u2019s done \u201can appropriate level of practice.\u201d \u201cYou do your homework and you do your best to \u2026 anticipate what he\u2019s going to say and be in a position to share with the nation a different way, at least what I think is a better way,\u201d Scott said on Tuesday. Scott would not elaborate on which issues he plans to address or if he would be discussing the effort to overhaul policing. \u201cI think it should be a surprise to everybody,\u201d he said of his speech, but, as a well-known fan of colorful socks, he did divulge that he had bought a new pair especially for the occasion. Scott\u2019s appearance comes as his profile has continued to rise on Capitol Hill. He is the only Black Republican in the Senate and has spent years highlighting racial tensions with police. He proposed legislation in 2015 to create a national database of police use-of-force incidents that resulted in death after an unarmed Black man, Walter Scott, was killed by a police officer in Scott\u2019s hometown of North Charleston, South Carolina. In 2016, he gave an impassioned, deeply personal series of speeches on the Senate floor detailing his experience as a Black man in America. Last summer, in the wake of George Floyd\u2019s death, he drafted legislation aimed at overhauling policing, an effort that ultimately failed on the Senate floor. Now he\u2019s at the center of a new bipartisan effort, a delicate process encased in cautious optimism from both sides of the aisle. Scott\u2019s speech comes as his discussions over a bipartisan Senate bill overhauling policing with Democratic Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey and Democratic Rep. Karen Bass of California, the author of the House-passed George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, have intensified in recent weeks. Their goal remains crafting a compromise bill, according to a source familiar with the talks. During last summer\u2019s failed effort, both sides drafted their own bills, with Scott\u2019s receiving a 55-45 floor vote in the then-Republican-controlled Senate, falling short of the 60 votes needed to pass. But a new political environment in a non-election year and an increasing sense of urgency spurred by a number of police shooting deaths across the country have given this effort a better chance of bipartisan success. States tackling 'qualified immunity' for police as Congress squabbles over the issue Bass, Booker and Scott met in person last week and on Monday night as they work to find compromises on the sticking points, according to a source familiar with the meetings. Though they have said they agree on a lot, serious issues remain. Two of them are qualified immunity, a legal defense used to protect police officers from civil litigation, and Section 242, a part of federal law that sets the bar for criminally prosecuting police officers. On qualified immunity, Scott has suggested shifting the responsibility from individual officers to police departments, while Bass recently said the officer and department should both be held accountable. Scott previously said Section 242 was \u201coff the table for him,\u201d but Democrats want to change the language to make it easier to criminally prosecute officers, allowing them to be charged for \u201creckless\u201d conduct as opposed to \u201cwillful\u201d misconduct, which is the current language and a higher legal bar. Bass recently told CNN that lowering the standard is essential to cutting a final deal. \u201cBecause the point is that we have got to hold police officers accountable,\u201d Bass said. \u201cEssentially now the standard that\u2019s used to prosecute an officer is so high. That\u2019s why they\u2019re never held to account. So you need to lower it just like you would for anybody.\u201d On Tuesday, Scott declined to say if the group had resolved those two key issues. First to CNN: Ilhan Omar reintroduces policing legislation as progressives eye ongoing bipartisan talks \u201cI think we\u2019re actually making progress overall,\u201d Scott told CNN. \u201cI hate to litigate and/or fight with through the press on these issues. They are really important issues to communities that are very vulnerable. We are trying to get to a place where we can solve those issues.\u201d Booker said Tuesday that the group is getting closer to its goal. \u201cIt has to be meaningful, substantive reform. We\u2019re not going to get everything done in one bill. There are larger, deeper problems in our country around policing that we have to try to address, but this bill must make meaningful strides to making real reforms and making people safer, making policing more accountable and more transparent and making sure that we hopefully curtail or end certain practices that we shouldn\u2019t have in the United States,\u201d Booker said. But it could take some time. Bass has said she hopes to have a deal by the anniversary of Floyd\u2019s death on May 25. All eyes remain on Bass, Booker and Scott, who will ultimately decide if a deal can be reached. There is genuine friendship and respect among the three, who have spoken effusively of one another as this has played out. \u201cA very healthy relationship,\u201d Scott said of the trio. \u201cThat does not mean we all agree, but the good news is I think we trust each other enough to actually make progress on substantive issues where there is disagreement. I think it\u2019s really helped.\u201d \u201cTim is a friend and an honest broker,\u201d Booker said on Tuesday. \u201cWe may disagree on a whole host of things, but we have worked together to get major bills done in the past. I have a lot of faith in him. I believe we\u2019re in a historical moment. History has its eyes on us. And there\u2019s an urgency in our country, and may we both rise in this Senate negotiation to get something substantive and meaningful done.\u201d Booker added that Scott is a \u201cgood faith actor, and he\u2019s also a Black man in America who knows a lot of these issues personally. If anybody can get it done on his side, he\u2019s the right person to be negotiating with.\u201d Why this GOP senator could be a low-key 2024 favorite Bass has praised Scott as a \u201cwonderful ally and partner.\u201d When Bass was seen heading to Booker\u2019s office on Monday to meet with Scott and him, she was carrying vegan cupcakes. Booker, who is a vegan, was about to celebrate his birthday. The three also bring with them the strong backing of their leadership and the understanding that if they agree to it, their leadership will as well. Booker said this week that he\u2019s confident Scott can deliver GOP votes if they are able to get a deal. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell has publicly supported Scott\u2019s current efforts on overhauling policing after asking him last summer to craft the original GOP proposal. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said Tuesday that he had met with Booker and Sen. Dick Durbin, an Illinois Democrat who is Senate majority whip and chairs the Senate Judiciary Committee, for an hour earlier this week to discuss a potential bill. Booker has said he\u2019s been given \u201cwide latitude\u201d to do everything he can to get a deal. \u201cThey\u2019re making good progress with Sen. Scott,\u201d Schumer said on Tuesday. \u201cThis is a serious problem. We need strong legislation. And we\u2019re hopeful that the Booker-Scott negotiations can produce just that.\u201d CNN\u2019s Manu Raju, Lauren Fox and Ali Zaslav contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Republican-controlled legislatures are charging forward with a raft of new state laws imposing limits on voting. GOP lawmakers in Montana recently passed new voting restrictions. And GOP legislators in Florida, Arizona and Texas soon could follow \u2013 as Republicans scramble to change the ground rules for future elections. \u201cIt\u2019s continuing full-speed ahead on this nationwide trend by state legislators to restrict voting access,\u201d said Jonathan Diaz, legal counsel for voting rights at the nonpartisan Campaign Legal Center.   One of the most closely watched states: Florida, a major political battleground where lawmakers are scheduled to adjourn by week\u2019s end. Bills under consideration there would limit who can return absentee ballots on behalf of voters, add identification requirement for absentee voting and bar outside groups from providing water to voters within 150 feet of a polling place. One Florida provision would require voters to reapply for absentee ballots for every election, rather than remain on an absentee voting list. The state Senate voted Monday on a largely party-line vote to advance its voting restrictions. The Republican-led moves nationwide come as Democrats in Washington have run into roadblocks on federal election legislation that proponents say could serve as a counterweight to the new restrictions. The speed with which GOP-led states are moving to clamp down on ballot access has put fresh attention on federal efforts to pass the For the People Act, a sweeping election, campaign finance and ethics overhaul pushed by Democrats. Among other things, it would require states to have at least 15 days of early voting in federal elections, allow for automatic and same-day voter registration, restore voting rights to former felons and bar states from prohibiting mail-in and curbside voting. It also says states must allow voters to submit sworn affidavits in lieu of photo identification. The bill has passed the Democratic-controlled US House and is set for consideration by the Senate Rules Committee on May 11. But it has run into a wall of opposition from Republicans who cast it a partisan power grab. It also has not won over the support of all Democrats, who hold just 50 seats in the 100-member chamber. The US Chamber of Commerce, one of the nation\u2019s most influential business organizations, also is lobbying against the bill, saying it curbs the political advocacy of business groups. One of the biggest potential obstacles: the reluctance of moderate Democrats, particularly Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia, to gut the Senate filibuster rules, which require 60 votes to advance legislation. Still, Manchin has expressed support for expanding voting access. Faced with the likely prospect of Senate inaction, some members of the Congressional Black Caucus are discussing a different strategy: advancing a more focused voting rights bill named for the late Rep. John Lewis in the hopes of breaking through the impasse. That bill, now under consideration in the House, seeks to restore key pillars of the Voting Rights Act, which required states and localities with a history of racial discrimination to first get federal approval on any changes to election laws or practices. In a 2013 ruling, the US Supreme Court gutted that requirement. Rep. Anthony Brown, a Maryland Democrat who\u2019s a member of the Congressional Black Caucus, said Democrats should consider adding the narrow voting provisions of the For the People Act to the John Lewis bill. \u201cWe need action sooner rather than later,\u201d Brown told CNN on Friday. By focusing on voting rights, he said, \u201cwe might be able to get Democrats who are clinging to the filibuster maybe to accept a narrow exception for voting rights, civil rights legislation.\u201d But some watchdog groups are lobbying Democrats to pursue the full array of measures in both the For the People Act and the John Lewis bill. They argue that the voting provisions alone are no more likely to pick up support than a broader overhaul that tackles government ethics and campaign finance. \u201cThere is no reason to not go for everything when we\u2019ve done so much work to get to this point,\u201d said Lisa Gilbert, executive vice president of Public Citizen. While the debate rages in Washington, states are enacting new restrictions and more court battles are under way. Laws signed recently by Montana Republican Gov. Greg Gianforte end same-day voter registration and change the identification requirements for voting. A student with a college-issued ID, for instance, now needs a second proof of residency to cast a ballot in Montana. Montana Democrats have sued to stop enforcement of the new laws. Lawsuits also are pending against new voting restrictions enacted this year in Iowa and Georgia. But on Friday, Kansas Democratic Gov. Laura Kelly bucked the Republican-controlled state Legislature to veto two bills that would have imposed new election restrictions. She called the legislation a \u201csolution to a problem that doesn\u2019t exist\u201d and said it would antagonize the kinds of businesses the state is trying to recruit. One bill sought to limit the number of ballots an individual could deliver to election officials on behalf of another voter. Another would have banned the governor, the executive branch or the judiciary from changing the state\u2019s election laws. It mirrored efforts in other states to strip governors and the courts of their power to change election rules \u2013 after election officials made it easier to vote during the pandemic last year and voters cast ballots in record numbers. More fights are coming. In Arizona, a bill that voting rights activists say would purge more than 100,000 people from the state\u2019s permanent early voting list stalled recently after an unexpected revolt from one Republican senator. That defector, Sen. Kelly Townsend, has pushed tougher restrictions and said she was holding out for the results of a controversial audit of some of the 2020 ballots demanded by Senate Republicans before she would support any voting measure. That audit kicked off Friday. The bill to remove voters from the early voting list still could be revived before Arizona lawmakers conclude their legislative session. In an interview Friday on CNN\u2019s \u201cNew Day,\u201d Arizona state Sen. John Kavanagh argued that the state needs to fix the voting list, even without proof of any election fraud. \u201cWe\u2019re moving forward to do bills to correct problems that came up during the election that need to be solved, regardless of whether there was actual fraud or nonexistent fraud,\u201d said Kavanagh, the chamber\u2019s president pro tempore. Texas, a traditionally red state where demographic shifts are changing the face of the electorate, is one of the next major battlegrounds over voting rights. The Republican majority in the state Legislature is advancing sweeping measures to overhaul voting procedures. One bill would ban drive-through voting and limit extended early voting hours \u2013 measures undertaken last year by local officials in heavily Democratic Harris County to make it easier to vote during the pandemic. Texas lawmakers also want to give partisan poll watchers broader authority, including allowing them to record voters who receive assistance while filing out ballots. Voting rights activists say that could lead to voter harassment and intimidation. Legislative action is just beginning in other key states. In Michigan, a presidential swing state that flipped to President Joe Biden in 2020, lawmakers are at work on a package of 39 election bills. Republicans there have said they want to exploit a quirk in Michigan law to circumvent a likely veto by Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer. If Republicans gather 340,000 signatures in a petition drive, the House and Senate can enact legislation without the governor having the power to veto it. In Ohio, a political battleground with a key US Senate race next year, Republican lawmakers recently announced their planned election overhaul, which includes a limit on ballot drop boxes. \u201cThis wave of voter suppression is not over,\u201d said Eliza Sweren-Becker, who is tracking the state laws as voting rights and election counsel at the liberal-leaning Brennan Center for Justice. \u201cIn many states, they are just getting into the swing of their legislative sessions.\u201d CNN\u2019s Kelly Mena, Veronica Stracqualursi, Pamela Kirkland and Eric Bradner contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "The Supreme Court is staring at its self-imposed end of June deadline, but the justices have not yet released some of the most significant opinions of the term, including a challenge to the Affordable Care Act, the Voting Rights Act and a case on religious liberty, an issue that has split the justices along familiar ideological divides this year. In the coming weeks the justices will enter what the late Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg used to call the \u201cbusy season\u201d where drafts fly between chambers and the justices seek to release all remaining opinions. The term, like the second half of last term, has been groundbreaking. Instead of appearing in their majestic chamber, participating in a freewheeling give-and-take with arguing counsel, the justices have convened by telephone for more stilted, less spontaneous arguments. Justice Amy Coney Barrett finally meets the other 8 Supreme Court justices for a class photo But the term has been most impacted by the death of Ginsburg last September, a personal blow to many of the justices who served with her during part of her near 30-year tenure. Each time a new member takes the bench, it changes the court, and now the justices are adjusting to their newest colleague, Justice Amy Coney Barrett, especially as they finish up the most controversial cases. Finally, eyes are on any retirement plans of Justice Stephen Breyer, 82. His departure would allow President Joe Biden and Senate Democrats to replace him with a much younger liberal. Here\u2019s what the court has coming up: On Monday, the justices will hear a challenge brought by conservative non-profits Americans for Prosperity (a Koch-affiliated group) and the Thomas More Law Center, to a California law that requires charitable organizations that solicit donations to disclose a list of their contributors to the state attorney general. The groups say they want to keep their donors secret and that the state has not shown a compelling reason for the law. They argue that the law will chill contributors from coming forward for fear of harassment \u2013 in violation of the First Amendment. Although the information is supposed to be confidential, the groups say that the state may make inadvertent disclosures. The art of persuasion: How past presidents have tried to nudge Supreme Court justices off the bench In response, California argues that the groups already have to file the same data with the IRS and the state needs the information as it tries to combat fraud related to charities. Three other states \u2013 New York New Jersey and Hawaii \u2013 have similar laws. The case is being closely watched by those who fear it could lead to more anonymous \u201cDark Money\u201d flowing into the system. \u201cThe non profits are asking the Supreme Court to make it harder for the government to require the disclosure of donor information,\u201d said Lloyd Hitoshi Mayer, an expert on campaign finance at Notre Dame Law School. \u201cWhile the case is about a state Attorney General asking for this information, if the Supreme Court raised the bar here, that would likely also apply to election donor disclosure laws down the road.\u201d On Wednesday, the court will hear a First Amendment case concerning the authority of public school officials to discipline students for what they say outside of school. A junior varsity cheerleader \u2013 identified in court papers as \u201cB.L.\u201d \u2013 who didn\u2019t make the varsity squad lashed out on social media while she was off campus, writing, \u201cf\u2013k school f\u2013k softball f\u2013k cheer f\u2013k everything.\u201d The words were accompanied by a picture of her giving a middle-digit salute. After the outburst, the girl was suspended from the squad as having violated team and school rules. Lawyers for the girl sued alleging the school had violated her freedom of speech. The girl won in the lower courts that held that school could not remove her for off campus speech. According to the court of appeals, she did not \u201cwaive her First Amendment rights as a condition of joining the team.\u201d Stephen Breyer worries about Supreme Court's public standing in current political era Back in 1969, the Supreme Court held that public school officials could regulate speech that would \u201cmaterially and substantially interfere with the requirements of appropriate discipline in the operation of the school.\u201d But that decision concerned speech at school. The Biden administration has weighed in in favor of the school arguing that there is some speech, that \u201cintentionally targets specific school functions\u201d that warrant discipline even if it occurs off campus. \u201cEmpowering public school officials to censor what students say when they are outside of school would be an epic restriction of young people\u2019s freedom of expression,\u201d said Witold Walczak, of the ACLU who is defending the student. \u201cIt would impact not only harmless outbursts like B.L.\u2019s, but would threaten young people\u2019s right to speak about important political, religious, and cultural matters, which is exactly the wrong lesson to teach young people.\u201d At issue is a major dispute pitting claims of religious liberty against the LGBTQ community. It comes as the new conservative majority has moved aggressively to protect rights under the Free Exercise Clause of the Constitution. In the new case heard in early November, Philadelphia froze the contract of a Catholic foster agency because the agency refused to work with same sex couples as potential foster parents. The agency, Catholic Social Services, sued under the First Amendment. Philadelphia defended its action saying the agency violated anti-discrimination laws that are neutral and applicable to everyone. Supreme Court again blocks California Covid restriction on religious activities Supporters of LGBTQ rights support the city, arguing it was within its rights to freeze the contract to an organization receiving taxpayer funds and turning away same sex couples. They fear that a decision in favor of CSS would clear the way for religious organizations to get exemptions from non discrimination laws in other contexts. Supporters of expanding religious liberty rights hope the court\u2019s conservative majority, expanding upon a trend from last term, will continue to hold the government to a higher standard when it comes to regulations that impact religious believers. Republican-led states \u2013 aided by the former Trump administration \u2013 are trying to get the court to invalidate the entire Affordable Care Act, former President Barack Obama\u2019s most significant legislative achievement. The case marks the third time the court heard a significant challenge to the 2010 law, although the stakes are heightened given the implications of Covid-19, the catastrophic deaths and the current burdens facing the health care industry. Biden's moves on Obamacare attract new signups -- and a second look from red states As things stand, Texas and other Republican-led states are challenging the law and California and other Democratic-led states, the House of Representatives and the Biden administration support the law. In one of his first acts as president, Biden informed the court that his government was reversing the position taken by the Trump administration. The Department of Justice now argues that even if the individual mandate is constitutional and that even if the court finds otherwise, it should sever the mandate and allow every other provision to stand. The Supreme Court is considering two provisions of Arizona law that the Democratic National Committee says violate the historic Voting Rights Act that prohibits laws that result in racial discrimination. One part of the state law requires that in-person Election Day voters cast their votes in their assigned precinct. Another provision says that only certain persons \u2013 family, caregivers, mail carriers and elections officials \u2013 may deliver another person\u2019s completed ballot to the polling place.   Eight years ago, Chief Justice John Roberts wrote the 5-4 majority opinion in Shelby County v. Holder, effectively gutting Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act, a provision that required states with a history of discrimination to obtain the permission of the federal government or the courts before enacting new laws related to voting. Since that decision, challengers to voting restrictions have increasingly turned to Section 2 of the law, that holds that no voting regulation can be imposed that \u201cresults in a denial or abridgment of the right of any citizen of the United States to vote on account of race or color.\u201d Democrats fear the new conservative majority on the court will now weaken Section 2. The case comes as Republican state legislators across the country are also moving at a fast clip to pass laws to restrict voting access. The justices are considering a case about when a police officer needs a warrant to enter the sanctity of an individual\u2019s home. In general, in such circumstances a warrant is required, although the Supreme Court has held that under certain exigent circumstances, a warrant is not required. If, for example, an officer is in \u201chot pursuit\u201d of a driver or if emergency aid is needed a warrant is not always necessary. Judges are split on how seriously to take John Roberts' abortion opinion The case at hand explores whether a categorical exception to a warrant holds up if the officer thinks the person he is following in \u201chot pursuit\u201d committed a less serious offense: a misdemeanor. It\u2019s the first time the justices have looked at the scope of the \u201chot pursuit\u201d doctrine when it comes to a minor violation. The case offers the Supreme Court the opportunity \u2013 for the first time in decades \u2013 to examine the relationship between NCAA spending limits and student athletes who are seeking compensation for their talents. At issue is a lower court ruling that struck down spending caps for \u201ceducation related benefits\u201d because, the court held, they violated antitrust laws. The NCAA is asking the Supreme Court to reverse the decision arguing that it is going to allow money to pour into the system under the guise of \u201ceducation\u201d which will destroy the distinction between amateur and pro sports. A lawyer for a class of students said the lower court got it right, and worried about the exploitation of students. The Supreme Court is again considering the power of union organizers in a case that pits agriculture businesses and privacy rights advocates against big labor and raises questions of when the government can allow access to private property without compensation. A ruling against the union position in the case would come after the Supreme Court in 2018 dealt a blow to the funding of public-sector unions. The case is brought by agricultural growers challenging a California state law that allows union organizers onto their property to speak to workers unannounced. They say it amounts to a government \u201ctaking\u201d of the land without just compensation. The Biden administration is supporting the union\u2019s position, a change from the Trump administration, which had backed the employers.",

            "article_content": "President Joe Biden\u2019s remarks before and after the conviction of Derek Chauvin for George Floyd\u2019s murder were clear and decisive. He called the evidence \u201coverwhelming,\u201d said he was \u201cpraying that the verdict is the right verdict\u201d and argued for the country to come together following a verdict that was a step toward racial justice in a country with systemic racism. Few presidents (certainly not the last one) would have made those comments. But while Biden\u2019s words may have stood out, they shouldn\u2019t have been surprising. Biden might never have become president without having the appeal he did in 2020 on uniting the country on issues such as race relations. Go back to last year. Biden\u2019s 2020 campaign was on its last legs by the time of the South Carolina primary. He had lost the three previous contents and didn\u2019t come close to winning any of them. Then he won the South Carolina primary by nearly 30 points. As 100 days mark approaches, Biden must consider how he moves forward on racial justice Biden won that primary, fueled by Black voters who supported him overwhelmingly and have been the most likely to say race relations were a top issue. When South Carolina primary voters were asked what issue mattered most to their vote, those who said race relations chose Biden by 40 points. South Carolina was no aberration. Biden won the plurality of voters who said race relations was their top issue in every single primary in which an exit poll crosstab is available. In all of those states, he carried a larger share of the race relations vote than he did statewide. In every single one of these states, Biden won a larger share of the race relations vote than he did on any other issue. All told, he emerged with an average 34-point margin among voters who selected race relations as their most important issue. Biden\u2019s appeal during the primary wasn\u2019t just about race relations, though. It was also about uniting people \u2013 one of the central tenets of his campaign. Again, remember South Carolina. Biden won those who said uniting the country was most important by an astounding 46-point margin. These large margins would continue as Biden rolled through the rest of the primary system. He ended up carrying voters who said uniting the country was a candidate\u2019s most important quality by an average 46 points. In those same states, Biden won overall by an average of just 13 points. He even won the unite the country vote in Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders\u2019 home state. Floyd was murdered in the late spring, and video of his death was replayed over and over again, as protests filled the streets. Biden spoke with Floyd\u2019s family following his death and called for the country to unite and for there to be justice. It marked quite the difference from former President Donald Trump, who stoked tensions. In the fall, Biden won the election. The exit polls reveal at least part of the reason why. Among voters who said uniting the country was most important, Biden won by 51 points. It was far and away the candidate quality on which Biden won the most by. Many voters were sick of what they saw as Trump\u2019s divisiveness. Indeed, a big reason why Biden won was independent voters who flipped from voting for Trump in 2016 to Biden in 2020. Biden won independent voters who said uniting the country was a candidate\u2019s most important quality by 53 points, according to the exit polls. The exit poll did not ask about race relations in particular, but an October Kaiser Family Foundation poll did. Just like in the primaries, race relations was a strong issue for Biden. Biden led Trump by 50 points among voters who said the issue of race relations was very important to their vote. The issue was of particular importance to Black respondents, who were over 20 points more likely to list it as a very important concern than respondents overall. Now as president, Biden must lead to bring the country together and heal the wounds that many voters perceived after four years of Trump. He needs to solve for the fact that less than a quarter of Americans are satisfied with the state of race relations (a near record low). Biden wants to be a president who unites the country instead of one, like his predecessor, who 70% of Americans thought left the country more divided than united after his time in office. We\u2019ll see if Biden\u2019s words and actions, such as those following the Chauvin verdict, ultimately do that.",

            "article_content": "A prominent pair of liberal donors is urging fellow contributors to back Virginia Democrat Jennifer McClellan in an effort to catapult the state senator ahead in the crowded gubernatorial field of this year\u2019s closely watched contest. In a letter going to donors Thursday, and shared first with CNN, California husband-and-wife team Steve Phillips and Susan Sandler, ask their donor network to plow money into McClellan\u2019s bid for the Democratic nomination \u2013 even as her rival, former Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe, scoops up key endorsements and campaign cash. If elected, McClellan would become the nation\u2019s first Black female governor. She trails far behind McAuliffe in fundraising. The couple is asking donors to help contribute $300,000 to McClellan\u2019s campaign and is putting up a $150,000 match to encourage giving. Virginia has no limits on the amount contributors can give directly to candidates. The letter is going to 500 donors. In an interview, Phillips singled out McClellan\u2019s work to help write a sweeping new law in Virginia that expands voting protections. The Richmond-area senator also sponsored the resolution in her chamber that helped Virginia become the 38th state to ratify the Equal Rights Amendment and has authored laws aimed at disrupting the so-called \u201cschool-to-prison pipeline.\u201d One eliminated the requirement that principals report to law enforcement any student behavior that may constitute a misdemeanor. The issues McClellan has championed and the history-making potential of her candidacy could help spur Virginians of color to head to the polls, Phillips told CNN. In an increasingly diverse state, he said, \u201cit\u2019s important to have a person who meets the moment.\u201d McAuliffe\u2019s \u201cwhole candidacy is about the past,\u201d Phillips added. \u201cElections are about the future.\u201d The Democratic primary in Virginia is June 8. The field is crowded. In addition to McAuliffe and McClellan, other major candidates include state Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax and former state Delegate Jennifer Carroll Foy, both of whom are African American. McAuliffe, who served as Virginia governor from 2014 to 2018, entered the race last December and quickly amassed a substantial campaign war chest. He also led fundraising during the first three months of this year, collecting nearly $4.2 million, according to figures compiled by the nonpartisan Virginia Public Access Project. Carroll Foy had the second largest haul, at $1.8 million. McClellan, who was prohibited by state law from fundraising during the parts of this year when the Virginia General Assembly was in session, raised a little more than $635,000. Gov. Ralph Northam, a Democrat, recently endorsed McAuliffe. Northam cannot run again because Virginia law prohibits governors from serving two consecutive terms. And on Thursday morning, Carroll Foy picked up a big endorsement, earning the support of EMILY\u2019s List, a fundraising powerhouse for women in politics. \u201cIt is long past time to elect a Black woman governor who will dedicate herself to bettering the lives of Virginia\u2019s working families and communities of color, as we know Jennifer will,\u201d EMILY\u2019s List said in a statement about Carroll Foy. McAuliffe, a former CNN political commentator, has \u201cgot the biggest name ID and he\u2019s got the most money to spend,\u201d said Kyle Kondik, who analyzes races at the University of Virginia Center for Politics. \u201cIf a single candidate could consolidate the non-McAuliffe vote, that person might be able to catch up,\u201d he added. \u201cBut I don\u2019t know if anyone is able to do that in the time remaining before the primary.\u201d The ask from San Francisco-based Phillips and Sandler could draw national attention to McClellan. They are veteran donors and were early financial backers of Stacey Abrams\u2019 political ambitions in Georgia, with Sandler making a seven-figure investment during Abrams\u2019 primary bid in 2018. Abrams was the first Black woman in the country to become a major-party nominee for governor. She lost the general election. But Abrams has gained a national following for her work to expand voting rights and is credited with helping turn Georgia blue in the recent presidential and US Senate contests. \u201cWe were on the cusp in 2018,\u201d Phillips said of the effort to elect Abrams and other African Americans to governors\u2019 mansions that year. \u201cWe may have been slightly early in 2018. Now, we are overdue in 2021.\u201d The savings-and-loan fortune of Sandler\u2019s late parents long has helped bankroll progressive projects, including helping start the Center for American Progress, a liberal think tank. Last year, Sandler committed $200 million to support racial justice groups. CNN\u2019s Chandelis Duster contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "The New York state legislature passed a bill on Wednesday that would automatically restore voting rights to people convicted of a felony once they are on parole. The bill is intended to improve upon a 2018 executive order granting voting pardons to the 35,000 New Yorkers on parole, according to Assembly member Daniel O\u2019Donnell, a co-sponsor of the bill. Currently, parolees must wait a period of four to six weeks to receive a pardon and then must register to vote on their own. The legislation would restore voting rights at the time of release and would require Department of Corrections employees to provide parolees with a voter registration form. Some Republican assembly members argued that a felon\u2019s debt to society isn\u2019t paid until they finish parole, but the bill was ultimately passed with a Democratic majority in both chambers of the legislature. The bill will be sent to Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo\u2019s desk, although there is no set timeline for when that will happen.   CNN has reached out to the governor\u2019s office for details about whether he will sign the bill. New York is among several Democratic-led states that are expanding voting rights and access to the ballot at a time when Republican lawmakers are seeking to impose new restrictions following former President Donald Trump\u2019s baseless claims about widespread fraud in the 2020 election. \u201cParole disenfranchisement in New York was designed to prevent Black men from voting, and we see the legacy of these laws in the largely Black and Latinx parolee population today,\u201d O\u2019Donnell said in a statement announcing the bill\u2019s passing. \u201cWith the passage of this bill, we are one step closer to dismantling the vestiges of segregation-era felony disenfranchisement in New York. We are sending a clear message to the rest of the country: the right to vote is foundational to our democracy and should be expanded, not restricted.\u201d O\u2019Donnell, who previously was the chair for the assembly\u2019s Standing Committee on Correction, told CNN that a version of this bill was originally drafted in 2005 and that he has been pushing for it ever since. \u201cSomeone who is successfully on parole, they are living a law-abiding life,\u201d he said. \u201cWhy can\u2019t they participate?\u201d The Brennan Center for Justice, which is deeply involved in voting rights issues across the nation, also lauded the legislature for its work. \u201cBy passing this bill, the state assembly has sent a clear message: if you live in the community, you should be able to vote,\u201d said Sean Morales-Doyle, deputy director of voting rights and elections at the Brennan Center. \u201cDisenfranchising people on parole is a vestige of Jim Crow and because of the racial disparities plaguing New York State\u2019s criminal justice system, it has had an enormous impact on Black and Latino New Yorkers. We look forward to the governor putting an end to it by signing this bill into law,\u201d he continued. Earlier this month, Democratic Washington Gov. Jay Inslee signed legislation that will automatically restore the voting rights of more than 20,000 people convicted of a felony once they\u2019re released from prison, even if they are remain under community supervision. \u201cWhile other states are restricting the right to vote, I\u2019m glad that in Washington, we are expanding access to democracy,\u201d Inslee said on April 7 in remarks before signing the bill. And in March, Virginia Gov. Ralph Northam, a Democrat, took executive action to immediately restore former felons\u2019 voting rights as soon as they complete their prison terms, a move that will immediately apply to more than 69,000 formerly incarcerated Virginians.

            "article_content": "The conviction of Derek Chauvin showed George Floyd\u2019s life really did matter to a justice system on trial. Now, millions of Americans wait to see whether a moment of rare hope will spur political leaders to deliver similar justice by reforming policing and eradicating systemic racism. A jury of 12 Minnesotans did more than convict ex-policeman Chauvin Tuesday on all counts of murdering Floyd by squeezing the life out of him with a knee to the neck. In a profound moment of modern American history, they offered a measure of optimism that Americans of all races will one day be treated equally and that malign police officers can be held accountable to the laws they are meant to enforce. The verdict will not bring Floyd back from an unnecessary death. Nor will it erase the millions of injustices faced by Black Americans not recorded on cellphone video, or the Black community\u2019s dread during encounters with police. Proof of that came in police shootings and harassment of Black Americans as the trial went on, in situations that might not have ended so tragically for Whites. But the moment when Chauvin was led to a jail cell, hands cuffed behind his back, triggered relief and, in places, disbelief. It validated a social and political movement, championed by celebrities and athletes, that spanned the globe after Floyd\u2019s murder last May that sent citizens of all ethnicities into the streets during a pandemic to demand justice. \u201cThis is monumental, this is historic. This is a pivotal moment in history,\u201d Floyd\u2019s brother Philonese told CNN\u2019s Sara Sidner. Brandon Williams, Floyd\u2019s nephew, poignantly noted that many Black men and women still live in fear every day. \u201cSo when I say today is a pivotal moment, it is chance for America to take a turn in the right direction,\u201d he said. \u201cWe can\u2019t stop here,\u201d President Joe Biden said at the White House, calling Tuesday\u2019s verdict \u201ca much too rare\u201d step forward for Black men. Vice President Kamala Harris said: \u201cWe are all a part of George Floyd\u2019s legacy and our job now is to honor it and to honor him.\u201d The method for making the most fundamental set of changes to policing in a generation, the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, is already sitting in the Senate. Democrats say it would end racial and religious profiling, ban chokeholds on suspects, eliminate no-knock warrants on drugs cases, make it easier to prosecute offending police officers and would overhaul police training to build trust with the communities in which officers serve. Yet its path is challenging given the opposition of many Republicans to the concept of Washington establishing federal standards for police. Obamas on Derek Chauvin verdict: 'We cannot rest' It was noticeable that \u2013 amid a torrent of Democratic reaction to Chauvin\u2019s conviction \u2013 there were few statements from Republicans, months after a general election in which former President Donald Trump sought to paint protests at Floyd\u2019s death as symptomatic of left-wing anarchy. His extremism is in line with what ex-Republican President George W. Bush Tuesday branded \u201cnativist\u201d sentiment in the party. Many Republicans, who can stop the bill with filibuster blocking tactics, are more keen to claim all Democrats agree with their most radical members on calls to abolish the police. As the jury wrapped up deliberations Tuesday, Republicans were fixated instead on a censure motion in the US House of Representatives accusing California Democratic Rep. Maxine Waters of inciting violence over the trial. Even more moderate Republicans may take the position that the justice system worked in convicting Chauvin and that further changes may be unnecessary. \u201cI have trust in our justice system and the great institutions that have always formed the basis of our society, obviously pleased that the temperature will hopefully be brought down a bit,\u201d Utah Sen. Mitt Romney, one of those moderate Republicans, told CNN. Rep. Karen Bass, one of the authors of the bill named for Floyd, said the verdict gave her hope for the legislation as she continues informal talks with GOP colleagues about a potential compromise. But there is still a wide gulf between Democrats and Republicans on reforming qualified immunity, which protects officers in civil court. And there\u2019s no guarantee yet that all Democrats in the 50-50 Senate are on board. With his speech following the verdict at the White House alongside Harris, and in his telephone call promising action to Floyd\u2019s family that was captured on camera, Biden appears fully committed on police reform. There had been some question previously over how much political capital a new President with a massive agenda and a historic kinship with the police would commit to passing legislation with an apparently unpromising path. Perhaps in a nod to intense political pressure he faces, as a President who owes his victory in last year\u2019s election in large part to Black voters, Biden said publicly Tuesday that he was praying for the right verdict, all while the sequestered jury was still deliberating. It\u2019s possible nationwide reaction to Chauvin\u2019s conviction builds both elevated expectations for the President and a wave of momentum that could change the political atmosphere, if handled skillfully. The attitude of police unions, forces and individual officers will also be critical to hopes of civil rights activists for a change of culture. Prosecutors made clear in closing arguments in the Chauvin case that they were putting an individual officer, not all police, on trial. And the case was notable for the parade of fellow officers who lined up to testify against their former colleague and to repudiate his conduct. \u201cThe main question is, will we let politics divide us?\u201d asked Floyd family attorney L. Chris Stewart on Tuesday. \u201cBecause that is what happens. Republican or Democrat, you are going to stick to your sides. Unify \u2026 and get this bill passed and save people so you don\u2019t have to board up your cities for situations like this.\u201d Countless leaders and activists, along with the President of the United States, underscored the point Tuesday that one verdict cannot produce the sea change needed in American society to root out the brutality and prejudice faced daily by people of color in their dealings with police. Poignantly invoking their point, activists named some of the thousands of other lost young men and women \u2013 including Eric Garner, Michael Brown, Tamir Rice, Breonna Taylor and Philando Castile. The harsh reality that police killings have continued even after a year of public outrage has been underscored by the recent deaths of 20-year-old Daunte Wright, killed by an veteran officer in the Minneapolis suburb of Brooklyn Center, and 13-year-old Adam Toledo, shot by a Chicago police officer responding to reports of gunfire after a chase down a darkened alley in March. Leading figures from former President Barack Obama to Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison emphasized that there is a long journey ahead that will hinge on the willingness of Americans to keep up the pressure as they seek an end to senseless deaths at the hands of law enforcement. Ellison, who headed up the team that prosecuted Chauvin, said he could not call the verdict justice, because that would imply \u201ctrue restoration. But it is accountability, which is the first step toward justice,\u201d he said. \u201cNow the cause of justice is in your hands \u2013 and when I say \u2018your hands\u2019 I mean the hands of the people of the United States,\u201d Ellison said during a news conference. BJ Wilder, a 39-year-old Minneapolis resident who listened to the verdict with other jubilant demonstrators in George Floyd Square, was one of many activists hopeful that Chauvin\u2019s conviction would be a turning point that leads to an awakening in America and accountability for officer misconduct. \u201cThis is something different. This is new,\u201d Wilder told CNN\u2019s Omar Jimenez moments after the verdict. \u201cWe\u2019ve been here so many times before and honestly the first thing that I really thought about was the Rodney King situation,\u201d he said, referring to the acquittal of four Los Angeles police officers who had beaten King \u2013 an event that led to the 1992 Los Angeles riots. \u201cAnd I thought it could have been something similar to that, just because we all saw that too. And this feels like \u2013 just feels like we can breathe. This feels like something new. It\u2019s hopefully a new day in America.\u201d CNN\u2019s Maeve Reston contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "A new wave of Black women are breaking barriers as they ascend to mayoral seats in cities with deeply rooted histories of racism and inequality. On Tuesday, Tishaura Jones will be sworn in as the first Black female mayor of St. Louis after winning the election earlier this month. Her victory came just two weeks after Kim Janey was appointed Boston\u2019s first Black female mayor following the resignation of Marty Walsh, who is now the US Labor Secretary. Janey recently announced she would run for a full term in this year\u2019s mayoral election. With the ascension of Jones and Janey, there will be a historic high of nine Black women serving as mayors of the nation\u2019s 100 largest cities. Other major cities led by Black women include Atlanta, San Francisco; Chicago; Baton Rouge, Louisiana; New Orleans; Washington, DC; and Charlotte, North Carolina. Political observers say the growing number of Black female mayors signals they are gaining electoral strength and appealing to voters in races that have been historically won by White men. They say Black women have proven they are relatable with an ability to lead, organize and engage new voters. Black women are also speaking out against the racial disparities in their communities at a time when the nation is having to reckon with systemic racism and police violence against Black people. Kimberly Peeler-Allen, a visiting practitioner at the Center for American Women in Politics at Rutgers University, said as more Black women rise to political power, the electorate is seeing the importance of having diverse voices making decisions. \u201cBlack and brown women are running with a message that is a totality of their life experiences, which transcends race or gender,\u201d Peeler-Allen said. \u201cAnd there are people who are saying \u2018she may not look like me but I know we share the same experience, because she is wrestling with credit card debt, or she has a family member with addiction or she\u2019s a small business owner, she\u2019s a veteran.\u2019\u201d Peeler-Allen said she believes the advancement of Black women in all levels of government could also be inspiring more to run for office. In the last few years, Kamala Harris became the first Black female vice president, Ayanna Pressley became Massachusetts\u2019 first Black woman elected to Congress, and Tish James was elected New York\u2019s first Black female attorney general. Black women helped push Democrats to the finish line in Georgia. Here's how they can do it again Stacey Abrams narrowly lost her bid to become the nation\u2019s first Black woman governor in 2018, but is now a powerful advocate for voting rights for people of color. Some political analysts view Abrams as a viable candidate for Georgia\u2019s gubernatorial election in 2022. Both Jones and Janey have vowed to make racial equity a priority while reflecting on their own lived experiences as Black women. Jones said during her victory speech that she would not stay silent or ignore the racism that has held St. Louis back. She told CNN she wants to address the exodus of Black residents in recent years and why they don\u2019t feel welcome in St. Louis. The city\u2019s Black population dropped from 51% to 45% in the last 10 years. Jones said she wants to revitalize the northern part of the city where she grew up because the neighborhoods have been neglected. \u201cI am ready for St. Louis to thrive instead of just survive,\u201d Jones said on CNN \u201cNew Day\u201d earlier this month. \u201cWe need to provide opportunities for everyone to succeed, no matter their zip code, the color of their skin, who they love or how they worship.\u201d Kayla Reed, executive director of the grassroots racial justice group St. Louis Action, said she believes Jones can relate to the plight of Black people in St. Louis because of her lived experience as a single mother from a marginalized neighborhood. The city, Reed said, struggles with segregation, disparities in education, employment and housing, overpolicing and violence in the Black community. Reed said Jones has embraced the demands of a racial justice movement that started in 2014 when unrest broke out in nearby Ferguson following the police killing of Michael Brown. Ferguson elected its first Black woman mayor Ella Jones last year. Jones is listening to the concerns of organizers and giving them a seat at the table, Reed said. \u201cShe understands the unique inequality that our communities face,\u201d said Reed, who campaigned for Jones and sits on her transition team. \u201cAnd it gives her an advantage to think through creative, innovative solutions to shift outcomes and conditions.\u201d In Boston, Janey has promised to answer the call for equity in a city with a reputation of being racist. Boston struggles with an enormous wealth gap, unequal economic opportunity, neighborhoods that are segregated along racial lines and disparities in access to education. The median net worth for White families is nearly $250,000 compared to just $8 for Black families, according to a 2015 study by the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston. There is also a racial disparity in city contract awards, with a recent study showing that only 1.2% go to Black and Latino-owned businesses. Black and Latino workers also face higher unemployment rates than White workers in Boston. Janey wrote in a Boston Globe op-ed that she will tackle these inequities with new policies and creative solutions. She also reflected her experience with racism as a child on the frontlines of school desegregation in the 1970s. Janey said rocks and sticks were thrown at her bus while people yelled racial slurs. Janey told CNN that she believes there is an added burden to being the first woman and the first Black person to serve as mayor of Boston. \u201cI know there is a perception and a reputation that Boston has, but I think what is important is that the reality and the opportunities that we create for residents here is one that is focused on equity, on justice, on love and ensuring that there is shared prosperity in our city and shared opportunities,\u201d Janey told CNN\u2019s Abby Phillip. \u201cIt\u2019s not to say that we\u2019ve solved everything when it comes to racism, but I think we have come a long way.\u201d Tanisha Sullivan, president of the Boston NAACP, said civil rights leaders have spent decades advocating for diversity in city leadership. Black people have been able to win seats on city council and Rachael Rollins was elected the first Black female district attorney of Suffolk County in 2018. However, Black Bostonians have hit a \u201csteel wall\u201d with the mayor\u2019s office before now, Sullivan said. These Black women are on the frontlines of the fight against Covid-19 \u201cThere has been more of a concerted effort and focus on breaking through with the belief that having more diversity in that office leading the way would result in public policy that was intentional about racial equity and so many other quality of life measures that would be good for our city as a whole,\u201d Sullivan said. Sullivan said racial justice advocates are now hoping Janey will create momentum around electing a woman of color as mayor in November. There are two Black women \u2013 Janey and Andrea Campbell \u2013 and one Asian woman, Michelle Wu, running for mayor. Sullivan said it is past time for a Black woman to win the mayor\u2019s office in Boston. \u201cWe have for generations now been the engine behind the ascension of so many others to political office,\u201d Sullivan said. \u201cIt has been our strategy, it has been our sweat equity, it has been the soles of our shoes that been worn out for others. It is not only our time, we have earned our spot.\u201d Jones and Janey are joining the tide of Black women mayors who have emerged onto the national stage in recent years. San Francisco Mayor London Breed gained national attention when she was one of the first to lock down her city when the Covid-19 pandemic hit US soil last year. Atlanta Mayor Keisha Lance Bottoms was one of the top contenders to be President Joe Biden\u2019s running mate. She was also lauded for her assertive response to protesters looting in city streets during uprisings last summer and speaking out against Gov. Brian Kemp\u2019s decision to lift Covid-19 restrictions last spring. Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot has made headlines for defending her city and standing up to sharp criticism from former President Donald Trump who threatened to send in federal law enforcement officers to fight violent crime there. Black women in New York are also hoping to join the short list of Black female mayors making history. Both Maya Wiley and Dianne Morales, who identifies as an Afro-Latina, are vying to become the first Black woman to lead the nation\u2019s largest city. Wiley has garnered the support of Black female celebrities including Gabrielle Union and Tichina Arnold. Rep. Yvette Clarke announced earlier this month that she was endorsing Wiley. Some activists say the success of Black women in mayoral offices is creating a pipeline for them to run for state and national office in the future. \u201cWe still have not had a Black woman governor, we still have not had a Black woman who has been speaker of the house, there is not a Black woman now in the US Senate,\u201d Reed said. \u201cSo, there are gaps, but I\u2019m confident that with the election on the local level, not only are we changing things but we are building a pipeline to answer those questions.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Incendiary warnings by Democratic Rep. Maxine Waters about the potential outcome of the trial of the ex-police officer charged with killing George Floyd could spike tensions, were legally unwise and raise questions of Democratic double standards. But they also drew out the hypocrisy of pro-Donald Trump Republicans over incitement to violence and ought not to overshadow the profound issues of race and justice raised by a harrowing four weeks in court. Waters\u2019 inflammatory remarks in Minnesota on Saturday justifiably caused an uproar as they came at a hyper-sensitive moment of one of the most racially sensitive and emotionally wrenching trials in years, with US cities on edge as jurors begin deliberations. Indeed, Republicans argue that her call on protesters to \u201cget more confrontational\u201d if they don\u2019t like the verdict would have resulted in swift punishment from leadership in Congress if they were uttered by a Republican. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy of California will likely try to force a House vote on a resolution to censure Waters on Wednesday, but Democrats will likely move to table it, House aides familiar with the matter tell CNN\u2019s Manu Raju. Michigan GOP Rep. Lisa McClain complained on the House floor that if Waters were a member of the GOP she would have already stripped of her committee assignments. \u201cAre they not the words someone would use if they wanted to incite more violence?\u201d McClain asked. That the presiding judge in the trial warned that the Waters comments might have given the defense of ex-police officer Derek Chauvin an opening during any eventual appeal against conviction raise the level of seriousness even more. And Waters, from California, has gifted a narrative to conservative media that pundits can use to distract from the eventual verdict and avoid discussing crucial questions about race and policing in America. Yet it\u2019s also hard to underestimate the sanctimony of Trump-enablers like McCarthy and Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene, a Georgia Republican, leading the charge against Waters after skipping over or excusing the ex-President\u2019s Capitol insurrection and backing his lies about election fraud that led to it. In Washington, clearly, incitement is in the eye of the beholder. During Trump\u2019s second impeachment trial, Republicans mobilized behind his defense lawyer\u2019s claim that his calls on his angry crowd to \u201cfight like Hell\u201d before they stormed Capitol Hill were metaphorical and \u201cordinary political rhetoric.\u201d They\u2019re not giving Waters, a veteran of the civil rights movement and its marches and protests, similar benefit of the doubt. Hear Maxine Waters' controversial remark about Chauvin trial The instant and politicized controversy that erupted over remarks by Waters in Minnesota probably complicated efforts to seek unity and political remedies once the jury returns a verdict. Waters told reporters while in a Minneapolis suburb that recently experienced another killing of a Black man \u2013 Daunte Wright \u2013 by police, that if the jury didn\u2019t find Chauvin guilty of murder \u201cwe\u2019ve got to stay on the street. We get more active, we\u2019ve got to get more confrontational. We\u2019ve got to make sure that they know that we mean business.\u201d In an interview with theGrio that was published on Monday morning, Waters said she was \u201cnonviolent\u201d and said her remark about being \u201cconfrontational\u201d was in regard to changing the justice system in the US. Had McCarthy been concerned about easing political tensions, he might not have issued a statement on Monday evening that poured more fuel on the fire. CNN has reported that President Joe Biden and his aides fear the country may be a \u201ctinderbox\u201d as it awaits the verdict. \u201cWe\u2019ve heard this type of violent rhetoric from Waters before, and the United States Congress must clearly and without reservation reprimand this behavior before more people get hurt,\u201d McCarthy said, unveiling a resolution to censure Waters and to get lawmakers on the record to \u201cstand up for peace on America\u2019s streets.\u201d Berman on Cruz's latest tweet: 'The pot calling the kettle violent' This is the same McCarthy who initially said Trump \u201cbears responsibility\u201d for the invasion of the Capitol by supporters on January 6 but then later traveled to pay homage to the ex-President at his Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida. He also tried to reinvent history by saying he didn\u2019t back the former President\u2019s attempt to overthrow a democratic election on the basis of flagrant lies about fraud and he has put Trump at the center of his midterm election campaign. McCarthy has also resisted punishing Rep. Mo Brooks from Alabama for his exhortation to Trump supporters on January 6 that \u201ctoday is the day American patriots start taking down names and kicking ass.\u201d While some Republicans wanted Brooks reprimanded, McCarthy demurred. Greene, a pro-Trump first-term member of Congress, said she would seek to pass a resolution on expelling Waters from the House for \u201cinciting Black Lives Matter terrorism\u201d \u2013 a symbolic measure given Democratic control of the chamber but one that will earn another conservative media blitz. But Greene herself has utilized extremist language in promoting her own brand of politics. A CNN KFile investigation this year found that in January 2019, Greene liked a social media comment that said \u201ca bullet to the head would be quicker\u201d to remove House Speaker Nancy Pelosi. In other posts, Greene liked comments about executing FBI agents who, in her eyes, were part of the \u201cdeep state\u201d working against Trump. The context of the comments by Waters \u2013 amid the immediate tension surrounding the trial and also filtered through the decades of racial struggles and the history of police violence toward Black Americans \u2013 is crucial. Hennepin County Judge Peter Cahill has made scrupulous efforts during the trial to insulate the jury from the exceedingly sensitive environment stirred by the death of Floyd. He appeared furious about Waters\u2019 remarks that had been raised by the defense seeking a mistrial on the grounds that the jury, which was not sequestered until after closing arguments Monday, may have been threatened and intimidated. \u201cI will give you that Congresswoman Waters may have given you something on appeal that may result in this whole trial being overturned,\u201d Cahill told defense trial Eric Nelson in denying the motion, though the judge said the failure by politicians to respect the trial were \u201cabhorrent.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m aware of the media reports, and I\u2019m aware Congresswoman Waters was talking specifically about this trial, and about the unacceptability of anything less than a murder conviction,\u201d Cahill said. \u201cI wish elected officials would stop talking about this case, especially in a manner that is disrespectful of the rule of law and to the judicial branch and our function.\u201d Earlier in the trial, Cahill had expressed frustration that that the city of Minneapolis announced a $27 million civil award to Floyd\u2019s family, though denied a defense effort to move the proceedings to another jurisdiction on the grounds that the jury could no longer be neutral. While Cahill\u2019s anger at Waters was palpable and politicians have a duty to avoid any steps that might be seen to influence jurors, he also ultimately decided that the controversy should not halt the trial. \u201cA congresswoman\u2019s opinion really doesn\u2019t matter a whole lot,\u201d Cahill said. L. Chris Stewart, co-lead counsel for Floyd\u2019s family, dismissed concerns that the Waters comments could threaten a conviction and said the defense was trying to cover up a weak case. \u201cThey were just trying to take their basketball and go home because they are losing,\u201d he told CNN\u2019s Erin Burnett on \u201cOutFront\u201d Waters, 82, has a long history of combative political speech that even observers without a political axe to grind might consider inflammatory. Yet there are also many examples of White, male politicians who have also clearly used similar and even more dangerous rhetoric \u2013 most notably Trump himself. So double standards can work both ways. Waters\u2019 comments undoubtedly channel the deep frustration of many Black Americans about their treatment by law enforcement officers and the burden of race that non-minority Americans cannot truly understand. It also follows multiple instances every year of Black Americans being shot by police in situations where Whites would likely have been treated differently. In a small insight into this pain, Mike Elliott, the mayor of Brooklyn Center suburb of Minneapolis where Waters spoke, told CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer on \u201cThe Situation Room\u201d on Monday he had experienced prejudice from his own police department. \u201cIt\u2019s not safe to drive in Minnesota while you\u2019re Black,\u201d Elliott said. \u201cThe fact of the matter is there\u2019s so many of us who drive, and if we see police behind us, we\u2019re afraid, you know, we\u2019re trembling. That is a kind of terror that no citizen of the United States should ever have to face. It\u2019s constant. It\u2019s ever present.\u201d Pelosi said Waters was not inciting violence and did not need to apologize. But after Cahill\u2019s remarks and McCarthy\u2019s intervention, there were signs of a more organized defense for the veteran Democrat. Democratic caucus chair Hakeem Jeffries tweeted from his campaign account, accusing McCarthy of double standards, writing: \u201cThis from the guy who supported a violent insurrection. And voted to overturn a lawful election. Maybe you should sit this one out.\u201d And Florida Rep. Val Demings, a Democrat who\u2019s a former police chief, said on CNN that Cahill \u201chas to do what he needs to do,\u201d but added that Waters was simply looking for justice. \u201cWe all need to focus on justice being served,\u201d she said.",

            "article_content": "Minnesota \u2013 and the rest of the country \u2013 is on a knife\u2019s edge waiting for a verdict in the murder trial of Derek Chauvin, the police officer charged in the death of George Floyd. It\u2019s a fraught moment \u2013 coming after four years of a president who weaponized race (and racists) for his political benefit and the mounting evidence of how race unduly influences policing. It\u2019s in these situations when the country\u2019s leaders need to, well, lead. Our elected officials \u2013 from President Joe Biden on down \u2013 need to urge calm and restraint while reminding people of our common humanity. Which is the opposite of what California Democratic Rep. Maxine Waters did over the weekend in Brooklyn Center, Minnesota, at a Black Lives Matter rally to protest the killing of Daunte Wright. (Wright was killed when a police officer apparently grabbed her gun rather than her Taser to restrain him.) \u201cI hope we get a verdict that says guilty, guilty, guilty,\u201d she said in response to reporters\u2019 questions. \u201cAnd if we don\u2019t, we cannot go away. We\u2019ve got to stay on the street. We get more active, we\u2019ve got to get more confrontational. We\u2019ve got to make sure that they know that we mean business.\u201d There\u2019s not much dot-connecting necessary here. Waters said that if Chauvin is not found guilty \u2013 closing arguments in the case began Monday \u2013 then \u201cwe\u2019ve got to get more confrontational.\u201d And she said it in a city that has seen protests and arrests in its streets for the last week. That sort of rhetoric \u2013 at a moment of such heightened tensions \u2013 is irresponsible coming from anyone. It\u2019s especially irresponsible coming from an elected official like Waters. The judge in the case admonished Waters on Monday for her comments. \u201cI wish elected officials would stop talking about this case, especially in a manner that is disrespectful to the rule of law and to the judicial branch and our function,\u201d said Judge Peter Cahill. He told the defense that Waters\u2019 comments may be grounds for the case to be overturned on appeal. Defending herself to theGrio in an interview, Waters said, \u201cI am nonviolent. Republicans will jump on any word, any line and try to make it fit their message and their cause for denouncing us and denying us.\u201d THE POINT -- NOW ON YOUTUBE! \nIn each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe! Of course, this isn\u2019t the first time she\u2019s done something like this. At a rally in June 2018, which came shortly after then White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders had been kicked out of a restaurant, Waters said this to crowd at a rally: \u201cIf you see anybody from that Cabinet in a restaurant, in a department store, at a gasoline station, you get out and you create a crowd and you push back on them and you tell them they\u2019re not welcome anymore, anywhere.\u201d In both instances \u2013 the one in 2018 and this latest one \u2013 Republicans demanded that House Democrats punish Waters for what they took to be dangerous incitement. \u201cMaxine Waters is inciting violence in Minneapolis \u2014 just as she has incited it in the past,\u201d tweeted House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, a California Republican. \u201cIf Speaker Pelosi doesn\u2019t act against this dangerous rhetoric, I will bring action this week.\u201d McCarthy made it official late Monday, saying in a statement that he is introducing a censure resolution against Waters. Yes, it is more than a little rich for Republicans to express outrage about incitement given that former President Donald Trump quite clearly incited the crowd at the January 6 \u201cStop the Steal\u201d rally \u2013 which led directly to the violent insurrection at the US Capitol. And because almost 150 House Republicans voted to oppose the Electoral College results after that riot. And many of whom \u2013 Mo Brooks, Jim Jordan, etc. \u2013 continue to insist, contra all available evidence, that Trump was cheated out of the election. And several of whom circulated a flier last week promoting the creation of the \u201cAmerica First\u201d caucus that promised, among other things to foster \u201ccommon respect for uniquely Anglo-Saxon political traditions.\u201d (The caucus has apparently been scrapped.) Yes, it\u2019s beyond ridiculous for Republicans to display selective outrage about Waters when they spent the last four years not just ignoring but enabling Trump\u2019s conduct \u2013 much of which was aimed at dividing the country along on racial, ethnic and gender lines. But simply because that is undeniably true doesn\u2019t mean that Democrats \u2013 especially Democratic elected officials like Waters \u2013 should have carte blanche to say and do whatever they want. For all of the people making the \u201cwhat about Republicans!!!\u201d argument, remember this: You can only claim the moral high ground if you don\u2019t get down in the dirt yourself. Republicans are wrong for aiding and abetting Trump. Period. Waters is wrong for encouraging confrontation and violence in a situation that requires the exact opposite of our leaders. Period. That\u2019s not to say the two actions are equal. Lying about an election and then failing to take responsibility for a violent insurrection that left five people dead is far more grave than what Waters is doing. But it still doesn\u2019t make what she is doing right \u2013 or responsible. This story has been updated with further developments.",

            "article_content": "In the beginning stages of Pennsylvania\u2019s high stakes Democratic Senate primary, even the most progressive of candidates are downplaying the label. Republican Sen. Pat Toomey\u2019s decision to retire next year means that for the first time in more than a decade, voters in what has become one of the country\u2019s most hotly contested swing states will not see an incumbent senator on the ballot in 2022. The opening has gifted Democrats both a chance to expand their narrow advantage and  \u2013 depending on who captures the nomination \u2013 the opportunity to introduce a pathbreaking new lawmaker to the Senate\u2019s mostly wealthy and buttoned-down, White male ranks. Following President Joe Biden\u2019s victory last November \u2013 and his early success in coalescing Democratic lawmakers behind his agenda \u2013 overlapping questions of representation and ideology are simmering again in Pennsylvania as the Senate primary field grows. Though progressive policies have largely been embraced by the Democratic mainstream, the contest is shaping up as a test of whether candidates who support ambitious projects like \u201cMedicare for All\u201d and aggressive action on climate change can succeed in such a politically divided state. Moderates are also under pressure \u2013 this time to find a candidate who can match the verve of the more progressive early entrees and motivate the party\u2019s increasingly liberal base to turn out in what is expected to be a challenging midterm season for their party. The field is already three-deep, with one more preparing to jump in, and could potentially double in size by the time next year\u2019s primary swings into full gear. Lt. Gov John Fetterman \u2013 the only current Senate candidate to have won statewide office \u2013 made the first big splash of the race when he announced a $3.9 million first quarter fundraising haul, a remarkable sum that his campaign said \u201c(solidified) his position as the clear Democratic frontrunner in Pennsylvania.\u201d But the release of the gaudy numbers followed news a day earlier that Braddock Mayor Chardae Jones, Fetterman\u2019s successor, chose to endorse another leading progressive, the Philadelphia-based State Rep. Malcolm Kenyatta, who is already running with the support of the national Working Families Party. Kenyatta told CNN that he hoped Jones\u2019 support \u2013 which he proactively sought \u2013 should be a sign to voters that \u201ca year out, this campaign is certainly not locked up for anybody.\u201d State Sen. Sharif Street on Friday announced the creation of an exploratory committee at a news conference in Philadelphia, where he was joined by Bob Brady, chair of the city\u2019s Democratic Party. Though he has not yet committed to a run, Street\u2019s decision to test the waters underscores how competitive the race will be to consolidate the vote in the state\u2019s Democratic hub. In separate interviews this week, Fetterman and Kenyatta declined to frame the coming campaign as a referendum on any wing of the party. Both praised the new President and played up their progressive bona fides, but backed off the label tag itself \u2013 a potential sign that the first class of Biden era Democratic candidates are keen to portray their views as mainstream and, in the case of Kenyatta, emphasize a potentially barrier-breaking background to excite primary voters. Kenyatta, 30, was an early endorser of then-candidate Biden ahead of the 2020 Democratic presidential primary \u2013 a decision he believes was validated not only by Biden\u2019s electoral success but the President\u2019s ability, so far, to unify competing factions of the party in support of his legislative agenda. Though his own politics are more closely aligned with Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, Kenyatta downplayed the implications of the party\u2019s ideological divisions. His campaign, he said, was fueled more by a frustration with the makeup of the Senate \u2013 where the challenges faced by a Black gay man like him and a working poor family like his, are for most lawmakers almost entirely academic. \u201cYou can\u2019t learn everything based on a white paper or based on a briefing you got from a staffer,\u201d Kenyatta said. \u201cI mean, with some of this sh*t, you just kind of had to be there.\u201d For the young state lawmaker, whose parents had both died by the time he turned 27, that meant moving around a lot as a kid and watching his mother, a diabetic, ration her insulin so she could afford to buy food for him and his siblings. \u201cMy mom, before she died, I think the highest wage she ever got was $12.50 (an hour). That\u2019s not represented in the Senate,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd yet, working people are told, \u2018Don\u2019t worry, don\u2019t worry, working person, we\u2019ll take care of you. We\u2019ll be fighting for you.\u2019 And it\u2019s like, will you? Will you, really?\u201d Kenyatta is also pitching himself as the candidate best-suited to rev up Democratic voters, especially those who have historically sat out non-presidential campaigns, ahead of next fall\u2019s general election. \u201cWe need to be doubling down, tripling down, trying to make sure those voters turn out. If you think about midterm elections, you always see a downturn in African-American turnout. You see a downturn in turnout among young people,\u201d Kenyatta said. \u201cWhen Black folks are on the ballot, more Black people vote. When young people are on the ballot, more young people vote.\u201d But as the field grows in Pennsylvania, new candidates \u2013 with compelling personal stories and credible claims to a winning coalition of support \u2013 seem to emerge by the day. On Monday, Dr. Valerie Arkoosh, chairwoman of the Montgomery County Board of Commissioners, made her official entry into the race to the delight of some Democrats hoping to elect the state\u2019s first woman senator. Street, like Kenyatta, represents a district in Philadelphia and is expected to formally launch a campaign soon. And that\u2019s before a trio of House Democrats \u2013  Reps. Conor Lamb, Chrissy Houlahan and Madeleine Dean \u2013 decide whether to join the contest. The House members will first have calculations to make about what their districts will look like after being redrawn by a GOP state legislature and, particularly in Lamb\u2019s case, whether a Senate run might mean effectively handing over his seat in western Pennsylvania to a Republican. Houlahan, an Air Force veteran, has stockpiled about $3.5 million in campaign cash, according to spokesman Connor Lounsbury, and Dean\u2019s star has risen in progressive circles since her turn as an impeachment manager in the second impeachment trial of Trump. The Fetterman campaign\u2019s claim to frontrunner status was echoed by a number of Democratic operatives and Keystone State political veterans. Former Gov. Ed Rendell told CNN that he considers Fetterman the favorite to win the Democratic nomination and marveled at the lieutenant governor\u2019s unique \u201ccapacity\u201d to raise small dollar donations. But Rendell, for so long the moderate totem of Pennsylvania politics, also expressed concern that Fetterman might be both too progressive to succeed in a general election and, because he is a relative stranger to the Democratic strongholds in Philadelphia and its suburbs, could struggle to compete there with more familiar faces. The lieutenant governor\u2019s sometimes gruff political style and appearance \u2013 he\u2019s 6-foot-9 and unafraid of the tattoo artist\u2019s needle \u2013 were, Rendell said, less of a worry. \u201cHe\u2019s a little unusual \u2013 different. These days in politics, maybe that\u2019s more of an asset than it would\u2019ve been five years ago,\u201d Rendell said. \u201cHe\u2019s going to be an attractive candidate in the primary.\u201d In an interview, Fetterman spoke about the politics of the last decade, but only to remind voters that, while the political dynamics around him have changed, his message has not. Where his longtime support for gay marriage and marijuana legalization once made him an liberal outlier, those issues have since become mainstream Democratic causes. \u201cI went from being considered a very strong, progressive voice in 2015 and now I don\u2019t even consider it progressive. I think the argument is over within the Democratic Party, and I think anyone who\u2019s fair-minded would agree with that,\u201d Fetterman said. On issues like the $15 minimum wage, \u201clegalizing marijuana or common sense gun reform, the support for unions, support for infrastructure \u2013 I mean, these are all (considered) common sense things now. I don\u2019t really consider that \u2018progressive\u2019 in that sense.\u201d What did change for Fetterman, and what he said ultimately sealed his decision to run for Senate, was the aftermath of the 2020 election, as mainstream Republicans routinely parroted Trump\u2019s lies about election fraud in a disinformation campaign that culminated with the deadly Capitol insurrection. \u201cI was appalled. And then, of course, like for many people, January 6 was just astonishing to me,\u201d Fetterman said, referring to the Trump supporter-led riot. \u201cI joked early on (in the campaign), I said, \u2018If I\u2019m your next senator, I promise to be 100% sedition-free.\u2019 So everything just kind of crystallized.\u201d Though Fetterman has not backed off his political message, his desire to litigate intra-party rifts is all but gone. He demurred when asked to describe the makeup of his coalition, instead pointing to the electoral scoreboard \u2013 one that, after finishing a distant third in the party\u2019s 2016 Senate primary, showed him overwhelming the Democratic primary field in his 2018 run for lieutenant governor. Fetterman and incumbent Gov. Tom Wolf blew out their Republican rivals in the fall, outpacing Wolf and former Lt. Gov. Mike Stack\u2019s margin four years earlier. \u201cMy coalition is the one that I\u2019ve already assembled. My coalition is being one half of a team that smashed (GOP gubernatorial nominee) Scott Wagner back to the Stone Age back in 2018, by 850,000 votes. And won 40% in a crowded Democratic primary,\u201d Fetterman said. \u201cMy coalition are the people that agree with these core, basic, moral, fundamentally fair and equitable policies.\u201d This time out, though, with the stakes even higher and in the aftermath of last summer\u2019s national reckoning on racial inequality, Fetterman has faced renewed questions over a January 2013 incident in which he left his home, shotgun in tow, to confront what turned out to be an unarmed Black jogger, after hearing the sound of gunshots in the area and calling 911. Asked about controversy surrounding the episode, Fetterman said that \u201cat no point during that episode was I ever aware of this individual\u2019s race\u201d and noted, as he has in other interviews and a Medium post, that the Sandy Hook massacre had taken place a little more than a month before. The jogger, he said, was going in the direction of a local elementary school. \u201cProfiling and the history in minority communities is a real thing,\u201d Fetterman added, \u201cso I understand why people might be concerned, but this had nothing to do with race.\u201d Kenyatta mostly passed on criticizing Fetterman over the confrontation. But he did question the his rival\u2019s decision-making \u2013 and the potentially troubling example it might set for others. \u201cWe cannot have people dishing out vigilante justice in communities and be able to say, well, you know, there\u2019s gun violence in this community, thereby, if I heard something, then I\u2019m justified in going out and taking whatever weapon I have to chase down whoever the person is,\u201d Kenyatta told CNN. \u201cI\u2019ve said that repeatedly and so my hope is that John apologizes, that he understands why that situation is problematic.\u201d No matter who ultimately emerges victorious from the Democratic primary, the Republican Party\u2019s Senate campaign arm is already working to cast the nominee as an out-of-step liberal running in a more conservative state than outsiders realize. \u201cCampaigns are marathons, but Democrat candidates in Pennsylvania are already sprinting as far left as possible, embracing Bernie Sanders\u2019 agenda to ban fracking and destroy Pennsylvania energy jobs,\u201d said National Republican Senatorial Campaign committee spokeswoman Lizzie Litzow. Neither Fetterman or Kenyatta support a fracking ban, though both have argued that the state needs to pivot \u2013 alongside energy companies \u2013 to clean technologies. Kenyatta said he supported a \u201cmoratorium on new wells\u201d and suggested there could be jobs in capping old, disused ones. Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee spokesman Stewart Boss made no secret of the fact that Pennsylvania \u201cis a top target\u201d for the party in 2022, and he expressed confidence that the party\u2019s candidates would enter the cycle in good stead, owing to the popularity of Biden\u2019s signature $1.9 trillion Covid relief bill. \u201cWith Washington Republicans already obstructing desperately needed coronavirus relief and now pledging to oppose a historic investment in rebuilding our infrastructure and creating good-paying jobs,\u201d Boss said, \u201cthe Republican nominee will have to defend an agenda that\u2019s deeply out of touch with Pennsylvania voters.\u201d The Republican primary, which is equally unsettled, could also pose challenging questions to a GOP still reckoning with its future in the shadow of a former President, who reportedly plans to be an active campaigner \u2013 and would-be kingmaker \u2013 in next year\u2019s contests. He has already begun to dole out endorsements to loyalists and prod prospective challengers to take on those who have crossed him. Jeff Bartos, a real estate developer who lost the lieutenant governor\u2019s race against Fetterman in 2018, recently announced he raised nearly $1.2 million in the first three weeks of his campaign. Rep. Mike Kelly and former Rep. Ryan Costello, one of the vanishingly few Republicans who have been publicly critical of Trump in the past, along with Trump\u2019s ambassador to Denmark, Carla Sands, and his Navy secretary, Kenneth Braithwaite, are other potential GOP candidates. Trump has not yet weighed in on the primary.",

            "article_content": "As President Joe Biden launches a new era of judicial appointments, the old guard of the bench is in its twilight. The judges of the Ronald Reagan era who pioneered the modern conservative revolution in American law are down to just a handful among the 870 total spots on the three-tier federal bench. Those few are still writing some of the most contentious, attention-grabbing opinions, for example to restrict voting, regulate abortion and limit free press. At the same time, influential liberals of President Bill Clinton\u2019s two terms, those most prominent in countering conservatism, are leaving and making way for Biden nominees. Judges David Tatel, on the influential District of Columbia Circuit, and Robert Katzmann, of the New York-based 2nd Circuit, announced their retirements soon after Biden\u2019s inauguration. This pattern reflects the enduring impact, along with innately political character, of judicial selection, whether seen in the young firebrands Reagan selected in the 1980s or the broad diversity Biden seeks today. Stephen Breyer worries about Supreme Court's public standing in current political era Of the 11 nominees Democrat Biden unveiled last month, nine are women, including three African American lawyers announced for powerful US appellate courts. Because federal judges are appointed for life, they can effectively carry out a president\u2019s legacy for decades. And much of a president\u2019s immediate success or failure can turn on the courts. US judges, still resolving challenges to former President Donald Trump\u2019s policy initiatives, are now taking up early lawsuits against Biden\u2019s agenda. Public attention typically focuses on the nine-justice Supreme Court, which is the ultimate arbiter of the law. But because the justices hear so few cases, the second tier of appellate judges remains the last stop for most cases in America. While there are no longer any Reagan appointees on the high court, there are still six active Reagan judges on US appellate courts, many known for their robust right-wing views, such as J. Harvie Wilkinson on the Richmond-based 4th Circuit, Frank Easterbrook on the Chicago-based 7th Circuit and Edith Jones, on the New Orleans-based 5th Circuit. Wilkinson penned a fervent dissent last year in a North Carolina voting rights dispute that was then cited by Supreme Court conservatives opposed to an extended deadline for mail-in ballots. \u201cOur country is now plagued by a proliferation of pre-election litigation that creates confusion and turmoil and that threatens to undermine public confidence in the federal courts, state agencies, and the elections themselves,\u201d Wilkinson wrote when the 4th Circuit majority allowed North Carolina to add days to its deadline for absentee voters amid pandemic worries. The Supreme Court, by a 5-3 vote, let the 4th Circuit majority opinion stand. Another of the six remaining Reagan appellate judges, Jerry Smith, who sits with Jones on the 5th Circuit, wrote the decision upholding a Louisiana abortion regulation that went all the way to the Supreme Court last June. (The 5th Circuit decision involving June Medical Services was reversed.) Easterbrook in Chicago has also been one of the bench\u2019s most consistent voices to narrowly interpret abortion rights. One other high-profile Reagan appointee, DC Circuit Appeals Court Judge Laurence Silberman, is semi-retired and not among the remaining six active Reagan judges listed in the Federal Judicial Center database. Even though, Silberman continues to make headlines, as he did in March with a dissenting opinion attacking the news media and urging reversal of the 1964 First Amendment landmark New York Times v. Sullivan that shields the press from lawsuits brought by public figures. \u201cI readily admit that I have little regard for holdings of the (Supreme) Court that dress up policymaking in constitutional garb,\u201d Silberman wrote. Judge Tatel was the author of a decision in the voting rights battle known as Shelby County v. Holder. As a court broadly upheld the 1965 Voting Rights Act, Tatel highlighted the \u201csecond generation barriers\u201d that minority voters still face in certain parts of the country. The Supreme Court reversed that decision in its 2013 ruling that scaled back the Act based on the notion that America\u2019s racial divisions have faded. RELATED: How the Supreme Court laid the path for Georgia\u2019s new election law How the Supreme Court laid the path for Georgia's new election law Tatel and Katzmann, only two of several Clinton judges who have signaled imminent retirement, also happened to have authored the appellate decisions involving subpoenas for Trump documents. Their respective circuit court majorities upheld the subpoenas issued, respectively, by committees of the US House of Representatives and a Manhattan grand jury. The Supreme Court in July largely affirmed the New York decision and rejected much of the House case, sending both back to lower courts for further proceedings. Chief Justice John Roberts often speaks of the ideal of judges severing allegiance to the presidents who appoint them. But it is axiomatic that jurists generally seek to leave the bench when a president of their own party has the opportunity to name the successor. As she was dying last September, Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg, according to NPR, told her granddaughter, lawyer Clara Spera: \u201cMy most fervent wish is that I will not be replaced until a new president is installed.\u201d Trump nominated Amy Coney Barrett shortly thereafter, and the GOP-controlled Senate confirmed her before Election Day. Reagan, who held office from 1981-89, generated a judicial selection process that tapped young conservative thinkers for coveted appeals court slots. For example, Antonin Scalia, a University of Chicago law professor, was appointed to the DC Circuit in 1982 then elevated to the Supreme Court in 1986. In addition to a total four Supreme Court appointments, Reagan placed 83 judges on appellate courts, a number no president since then has equaled. Republican presidents have tried to adopt the Reagan team\u2019s ideologically focused approach, and former President Trump had remarkable success, aided by While House counsel Don McGahn, controlling the screening of candidates, and then-Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, speeding the Trump selections through the Senate. In his single term, Trump was able to appoint 54 appellate judges, just one fewer than Obama\u2019s appeals court total for two terms, 55 judges. Obama\u2019s judicial efforts were regularly stalled by McConnell, who ensured that when Trump came into office in January 2017, about 100 vacancies existed across the judiciary. In contrast to the Trump choices that were overwhelmingly white men, Biden has made diversity a priority, exemplified by his first three appellate court nominations: Ketanji Brown Jackson to the DC Circuit; Candace Jackson-Akiwumi to the Chicago-based 7th Circuit, and Tiffany Cunningham to the Federal Circuit, which hears intellectual property disputes. All three are African American women with Ivy League credentials and diverse experience. John Roberts dissents alone and doesn't hold back Jackson, 50, currently serves as a trial judge on a US district court in Washington. Former President Obama, who had appointed Jackson to that post, considered her among several candidates in early 2016 for the Supreme Court vacancy caused by that February\u2019s death of Scalia. (Obama eventually chose DC Circuit Judge Merrick Garland, who was then blocked by Majority Leader McConnell from any Senate consideration. Biden named Garland attorney general.) Before appointment to the bench, Jackson served as a vice chair on the US Sentencing Commission and worked in the Federal Public Defender office. A Harvard law graduate, she served as a law clerk in the 1999-2000 session to Justice Stephen Breyer, the member of the Supreme Court most likely to retire soon. The 82-year-old Breyer, a 1994 Clinton appointee, has declined to comment on any retirement plans. On deck for the 7th Circuit, Jackson-Akiwumi, 41, worked for a decade as a staff attorney at the Federal Defender Program in the northern district of Illinois before becoming a partner at a law firm in Washington. She holds a Yale law degree. Nominated to the Federal Circuit, Cunningham, 44, currently specializes in patent litigation in Chicago. She holds a Harvard law degree. These three candidates would join a small band of pathbreakers, as there currently are only four Black women actively serving as appeals court judges, according to the Federal Judicial Center. All are in their late 60s or older. During the presidential campaign, Biden made a single vow related to any appointment for the Supreme Court. During a February 2020 debate in Charleston, South Carolina, he said: \u201cI\u2019m looking forward to making sure there\u2019s a Black woman on the Supreme Court, to make sure we in fact get every representation.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Justice Stephen Breyer, who may be nearing the end of his Supreme Court tenure, expressed concern on Tuesday about the standing of the high court and the possible erosion of public confidence in its decisions. In an expansive, two-hour lecture at Harvard Law School, Breyer bemoaned the common practice \u2013 by journalists, senators and others \u2013 of referring to justices by the presidents who appointed them and of describing the nine by their conservative or liberal approach to the law. \u201cThese are more than straws in the wind,\u201d the 82-year-old Breyer said. \u201cThey reinforce the thought, likely already present in the reader\u2019s mind, that Supreme Court justices are primarily political officials or \u2018junior league\u2019 politicians themselves rather than jurists. The justices tend to believe that differences among judges mostly reflect not politics but jurisprudential differences. That is not what the public thinks.\u201d When Justice Stephen Breyer rules (on retirement), the White House might know first Breyer also warned against proposals to expand the size of the Supreme Court from its current nine members. Public trust was \u201cgradually built\u201d over the centuries, he said, and any discussion of change should take account of today\u2019s public acceptance of the court\u2019s rulings, even those as controversial as the 2000 Bush v. Gore case that settled a presidential election. \u201cThe public now expects presidents to accept decisions of the court, including those that are politically controversial,\u201d he said. \u201cThe court has become able to impose a significant check \u2013 a legal check \u2013 upon the Executive\u2019s actions in cases where the Executive strongly believes it is right.\u201d He said people \u201cwhose initial instincts may favor important structural \u2026 changes, such as \u2026 \u2018court-packing\u2019\u201d should \u201cthink long and hard before embodying those changes in law.\u201d Court expansion proposals have been raised by liberal advocates disheartened by the long building conservatism of the Supreme Court and its relatively new 6-3 conservative-liberal makeup, since last fall\u2019s death of Ruth Bader Ginsburg and former President Donald Trump\u2019s selection of Amy Coney Barrett to succeed her. Breyer is one of the three liberals, yet he emphasized on Tuesday he believes his differences with colleagues are jurisprudential, rather than based on ideology or politics. Biden unveils first slate of judicial nominees featuring diverse and history-making selections The court\u2019s six conservatives were appointed by Republican presidents, the three liberals by Democratic presidents. Breyer said in his speech that decades earlier such political references would not have been part of news coverage. But decades earlier, there was not such neat political and ideological symmetry. Republican appointees, such as Justice John Paul Stevens, a 1975 choice of President Gerald Ford, ended up voting with the liberal wing of the bench. Stevens, who retired in 2010, was the last of his kind in this modern era, when presidents carefully screen for ideology and justices rarely break expectations. He also lamented the state of today\u2019s Senate screening of judicial candidates. \u201cThe Senate confirmation process has changed over the past two or three decades, becoming more partisan with senators far more divided along party lines,\u201d he said. \u201cSenators will often describe a nominee they oppose as too \u2018liberal\u2019 or too \u2018conservative.\u2019 What they say, reported by the press to their constituents, reinforces the view that politics, not legal merits, drives Supreme Court decisions.\u201d Breyer\u2019s speech, delivered as he stood against a Harvard Law crimson backdrop and carried over Zoom, reflected his own broad reading of constitutional guarantees, as well as his aspirations and fears for today\u2019s judiciary. Breyer has written some of the most forceful opinions attempting to preserve landmarks on abortion rights and school desegregation. Unlike his colleagues on the right wing, he has also endorsed the broad regulatory power of government to protect workers, consumers and the environment. Justice Clarence Thomas suggests US should regulate Facebook, Google and Twitter A former law professor who never lost his academic air, Breyer devoted most of his speech to the high court\u2019s roots of power before delving into some of his current concerns. \u201cIt\u2019s a long lecture,\u201d he warned at the outset of the event, noting that he would take a break midway through. He wove in references to his Capitol Hill service for the late Massachusetts Democratic Sen. Ted Kennedy in the 1970s and concluded with references to Albert Camus\u2019 \u201cThe Plague,\u201d a favorite of Breyer\u2019s even before the country was seized by the coronavirus pandemic. Since President Joe Biden\u2019s January inauguration, Breyer, who was appointed to the bench in 1994 by Democratic President Bill Clinton, has seen regular news commentary by fellow Democrats urging him to retire while Biden has a Democratic majority in the Senate, if only by the current one-vote margin. Breyer has declined to talk about his retirement prospects and on Tuesday avoided the topic altogether. If Breyer, the eldest of the nine, does announce his retirement in upcoming months, he would give Biden an opportunity to appoint the country\u2019s first Black woman justice, as Biden has vowed. That would likely not change the ideological makeup of the bench, but it would enhance its diversity and relative youthfulness. How the Supreme Court laid the path for Georgia's new election law Tuesday\u2019s Harvard lecture was part of an annual event in honor of the late Justice Antonin Scalia. Breyer advocates a judicial approach that expansively interprets the Constitution, the opposite of Scalia\u2019s method, known as originalism, tied to the 18th Century understanding of constitutional guarantees. Yet Breyer and Scalia, who died in 2016, were friends and in Tuesday\u2019s lecture, Breyer joked about their appearances on the law school circuit. In his nearly 27 years of service on the high court, Breyer has tried to bridge relations with conservatives, saying he abhors dissents and considers them a \u201cfailure.\u201d Who will be the next Antonin Scalia? Conservatives fight over his legacy Some of Breyer\u2019s most compelling opinions, it should be noted, have been written in dissent. In 2007, for example, he objected to an opinion by Chief Justice John Roberts rejecting school integration plans in Seattle and Louisville. Roberts said districts could not consider a student\u2019s race when making school assignments to reduce racial isolation throughout the school district. \u201cThis is a decision that the Court and the Nation will come to regret,\u201d wrote Breyer, whose father, Irving Breyer, was a long-serving school board member in San Francisco. Breyer still wears the wristwatch his father received upon his retirement from the district. Breyer said the Roberts opinion threatened \u201cthe promise of\u201d the 1954 Brown v. Board of Education decision. Breyer said Tuesday that differences with his colleagues were based on their distinct views of the structure of the Constitution or how they interpreted statutes. He did not refer to instances in which his colleagues themselves have publicly questioned each other\u2019s motives. Breyer did allow that sometimes justices weigh public opinion or the future ramifications of a decision. And he acknowledged that the nine are products of their individual backgrounds and experiences. Still, he said, \u201cjudicial philosophy is not a code word for \u2018politics.\u2019\u201d",

            "article_content": "Virginia and New Jersey this week joined other Democratic-led states moving ahead with new laws that would expand voting access \u2013 a stark contrast to the Republican rush in statehouses across the country to make voting more difficult. According to the Brennan Center for Justice, which has tracked voting measures across the country, 843 bills that would expand voting access, largely offered by Democrats, have been introduced in 47 states. Republicans press ahead with voting restrictions in key states, even as legal fights mount over new Georgia law Republican lawmakers have introduced 361 restrictive bills in a different set of 47 states. Texas, Arizona and Georgia \u2013 states that are competitive in presidential elections, but where Republicans have full control of statehouses \u2013 have seen the largest numbers of restrictive bills introduced, according to the Brennan Center. The crush of new voting rules comes after former President Donald Trump\u2019s lies about widespread fraud in the 2020 election ignited a new, fiercely partisan flame under the fundamental issue of voting access. There are rare exceptions: Kentucky\u2019s Republican-controlled legislature this week passed bipartisan voting reform legislation, sending to Democratic Gov. Andy Beshear\u2019s desk a bill allowing no-excuse in-person early voting on Thursday through Saturday in the week before an election, but backing away from the emergency expansion of mail-in voting that took place last year amid the coronavirus pandemic. Largely, though, states that have expanded voting access are controlled by Democrats. And those that are making voting harder \u2013 Georgia and Iowa already have new laws on the books; Arizona, Florida, Texas, Michigan and other key states are currently advancing bills that would impose new restrictions \u2013 are led by Republicans or, in Michigan\u2019s case, have a GOP-controlled legislature that plans to circumvent the Democratic governor. A number of those GOP measures would even prohibit Democratic-led counties, such as Harris County, the largest in Texas and home of Houston, from implementing their own efforts to ease voting access. \u201cYour access to the ballot depends a lot on where you live,\u201d said Jon Greenbaum, chief counsel of Lawyers\u2019 Committee for Civil Rights under Law, \u201cand the divide is growing.\u201d It\u2019s part of the reason voting rights activists and Democrats have pushed to establish baseline voting rules for all Americans. But those proposals, including the House-passed \u201cFor the People Act,\u201d which would expand early voting, allow same-day registration, require automatic voter registration, ease ID requirements and more, has not attracted enough Republican support to clear the Senate. The rush to change voting laws and the heightened attention both parties\u2019 bases are paying to the issue shows the hyper-partisan nature of what could be the most significant battle over voting access since the civil rights era. It\u2019s a departure from a more recent period in which some overhauls of voting laws were implemented with bipartisan support. Early shifts to mail-only voting, for example, occurred in Republican-dominated Utah and in Oregon, where the change was backed by GOP lawmakers. Previous expansions of voting access often happened \u201cin what we would deem non-competitive states,\u201d including traditionally red states such as Alaska, which has automatic voter registration, Sylvia Albert, director of voting and elections at Common Cause, said in an online briefing with journalists Wednesday. But following Trump\u2019s falsehoods about election fraud, \u201cwhat we are now seeing is that any state, that is, you know, Republican-controlled, is trying to move forward on voter-suppression measures, and many Democratic states \u2026 saw the greater outcomes from the last election \u2013 greater turnout and access \u2013 and are moving forward with expansions.\u201d That\u2019s not true in every single state, she said, but \u201cwe are seeing trends, and they are often breaking down\u201d along partisan lines. In Washington, the state legislature has sent to Democratic Gov. Jay Inslee\u2019s desk a bill that would automatically restore the voting rights of people convicted of a felony once they are released from prison. The measure was approved despite Republicans\u2019 objections to restoring the voting rights of those who are on parole or probation. In Delaware, the state Senate has approved a bill to automatically register voters when they visit the Department of Motor Vehicles. That bill now heads to the House. Virginia \u2013 where Democrats won control of the Senate in late 2019, giving the party its first majority in both chambers of the legislature since 1994 \u2013 has been the most aggressive in expanding voting access. The state in recent months has repealed its voter ID law, made Election Day a holiday, allowed 45 days of no-excuse absentee voting and established automatic voter registration for anyone who obtains a driver\u2019s license. Democratic Gov. Ralph Northam last month took executive action to immediately restore former felons\u2019 voting rights as soon as they complete their prison terms, a move that will immediately apply to more than 69,000 formerly incarcerated Virginians. Northam this week also approved the Voting Rights Act of Virginia, which would make the state the first to enact its own version of the federal Voting Rights Act. He made minor technical changes to the measure, which must be approved by the legislature before it becomes law. The measure would require local elections officials to take public feedback or get advanced approval from the state\u2019s attorney general before making changes such as moving voting precincts. It allows the attorney general to sue over voter suppression, and prohibits racial discrimination or intimidation related to voting. \u201cAt a time when voting rights are under attack across our country, Virginia is expanding access to the ballot box, not restricting it,\u201d Northam said in a statement. Lawmakers in New Jersey have sent the state\u2019s Democratic governor two election bills that together would expand voting rights for residents in the state, as GOP-led states move to restrict access to the ballot box elsewhere. The first bill, given final passage from the state Senate on Thursday in a 28-8 vote, would allow residents to vote 10 days before a general election at specially designated polling sites, according to a release from the New Jersey Senate Democrats. The bill only applies to a June primary or a November general election, according to the lawmakers, but municipalities could adopt an early voting period by ordinance for other elections. A spokesperson for Gov. Phil Murphy said that the governor intends to sign the early voting bill on Tuesday. A second bill sent to the governor gives the county board of elections the ability to determine the location of ballot drop boxes, the lawmakers\u2019 release said. The state General Assembly and Senate gave final approval to the measure on Thursday. CNN\u2019s Taylor Romine and Devan Cole contributed to this report.",

Ralph Northam on Wednesday approved the Voting Rights Act of Virginia, which aims to eliminate voter suppression and intimidation in the state \u2013 a move that\u2019s in stark contrast to Republican-led efforts to restrict voting access in key states around the US. Virginia is the first state to enact its own version of the federal Voting Rights Act, according to Northam\u2019s office.

The Democratic governor made minor technical changes to the bill, which must be approved by the legislature before it becomes law, according to Alena Yarmosky, senior communications adviser to Northam. \u201cWith the Voting Rights Act of Virginia, our Commonwealth is creating a model for how states can provide comprehensive voter protections that strengthen democracy and the integrity of our elections. I am proud to support this historic legislation, and I urge Congress to follow Virginia\u2019s example.\u201d The legislation would require local election officials to get feedback through public comment or pre-approval from the attorney general\u2019s office in order to make any changes in voting regulations, according to a release from Northam\u2019s office. It also requires that local election officials provide voting materials in foreign languages as needed. Individuals who experience voter suppression will also be allowed to sue, where any civil penalties awarded will go toward a newly established Voter Education and Outreach Fund.   The bill comes after Northam restored voting rights to 69,000 former felons through executive action earlier this month. This also comes as a handful of states have recently moved to expand access to the ballot. On Tuesday, Kentucky\u2019s Republican-led General Assembly passed bipartisan voting reform legislation setting rules for absentee and early voting. In New Jersey, lawmakers approved two voting bills aimed at expanding early voting and the use of ballot drop boxes. While the Delaware state Senate advanced a measure this week that would establish automatic voter registration in the state. As of February, state lawmakers have carried over, prefiled, or introduced 704 bills with provisions that expand voting access in a different set of 43 states, according to a tally from the left-leaning Brennan Center for Justice. Voting rights groups, including the Lawyers\u2019 Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, hailed the passage as a victory for voters of color. \u201cNow, all commonwealth communities, no matter their racial and ethnic demographics, have an equal opportunity to cast their vote and have their voices heard,\u201d Marcia Johnson-Blanco, co-director of the Voting Rights Project at the Lawyer\u2019s Committee, said in a statement on Wednesday. \u201cAs our nation continues its reckoning with structural racism and systemic inequality, we hope that other states will follow suit and expand voting rights protections so communities who have been traditionally disenfranchised will no longer have to worry about egregious barriers to the ballot box,\u201d Johnson-Blanco said.",

            "article_content": "Late civil rights leader Rep. John Lewis\u2019 posthumous graphic novel, \u201cRun: Book One,\u201d is set to be released this summer, as the fight for voting rights intensifies in Lewis\u2019 own state of Georgia and efforts are under way to restrict voter access in more than 40 states. The novel is a sequel to Lewis\u2019 graphic novel memoir, \u201cMarch,\u201d and chronicles the period following the passage of the Voting Rights Act in 1965, an \u201coften overlooked chapter of civil rights history,\u201d according to the book\u2019s publisher, Abrams ComicArts. The novel begins \u201cwith John Lewis and his colleagues facing another arrest as the Ku Klux Klan prepares their largest hooded march in years,\u201d per a release from Abrams. \u201cLewis recounts the highs and lows of a movement fighting to harness their hard-won legal protections to become an electoral force as the Vietnam War consumes the American political landscape\u2014all while the forces of white supremacy gather to mount a decades-long campaign to destroy the dream of the \u2018Beloved Community\u2019 that John Lewis, Dr. King, and so many others worked to build,\u201d the release states. The son of sharecroppers who survived a brutal beating by police during a landmark 1965 march in Selma, Alabama, Lewis became a towering figure of the civil rights movement, championed voter rights and served as a longtime US congressman before his death in July at age 80 following a six-month battle with cancer. A Democrat who served as the US representative for Georgia\u2019s 5th Congressional District for more than three decades, Lewis was widely seen as a moral conscience of Congress because of his decades-long embodiment of nonviolent fight for civil rights. \u201cIn sharing my story, it is my hope that a new generation will be inspired by Run to actively participate in the democratic process and help build a more perfect Union here in America,\u201d Lewis said in a statement before his death released by Abrams. \u201cRun: Book One\u201d is set to be released August 3. Lewis\u2019 message takes on a new significance in light of Georgia\u2019s new election law, part of a larger effort by GOP legislators across the country \u2013 including in the battleground states of Michigan and Arizona \u2013 to roll back voting access in the wake of the 2020 election. The Georgia law, signed by Republican Gov. Brian Kemp last week, imposes new voter identification requirements for absentee ballots, empowers state officials to take over local elections boards, limits the use of ballot drop boxes and makes it a crime to approach voters in line to give them food and water. Voting rights groups have said the law would target Black residents and other voters of color in the state. The law has faced swift outcry, already facing multiple lawsuits from civil rights groups. Georgia state Rep. Park Cannon was arrested and removed from the Georgia Capitol on Thursday after she refused to stop knocking on the governor\u2019s office door as he signed the bill. Lewis\u2019 son John-Miles Lewis, as well as the children of fellow late civil rights movement leaders the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and the Rev. Cordy Tindell \u201cC.T.\u201d Vivian, released a joint letter late Monday night accusing corporate leaders of having failed to live up to \u201ctheir racial equity commitments\u201d and disrespected their fathers\u2019 tireless work. \u201cRather than sowing seeds to provide democracy the greatest chance to grow today and prevail tomorrow, legislators are attempting to transport us back to the shameful period of American history when mass voter suppression for communities of color was the law of the land,\u201d they wrote in the letter.

            "article_content": "Several civil rights and voting rights groups have filed a lawsuit challenging the Georgia\u2019s new voting law, which was signed last week by Republican Gov. Brian Kemp. The suit \u2013 filed by the Georgia NAACP, Georgia Coalition for the People\u2019s Agenda, League of Women Voters of Georgia, GALEO Latino Community Development Fund, Common Cause and the Lower Muskogee Creek Tribe \u2013 claims \u201cSB 202 is the culmination of a concerted effort to suppress the participation of Black voters and other voters of color by the Republican State Senate, State House, and Governor.\u201d This is the second federal lawsuit to challenge the election law that brings a raft of new voting restrictions to Georgia. The law specifically imposes voter identification requirements for absentee ballots, empowers state officials to take over local elections boards, limits the use of ballot drop boxes and makes it a crime to approach voters in line to give them food and water. Republicans cast the measure, dubbed The Election Integrity Act of 2021, as necessary to boost confidence in elections after the 2020 election saw former President Donald Trump make repeated, unsubstantiated claims of fraud. But the new lawsuit alleges Republican officials included specific changes that target voters of color after the record turnout and Democratic victories in the November 2020 presidential election and two Senate runoffs in January 2021. \u201cUnable to stem the tide of these demographic changes or change the voting patterns of voters of color, these officials have resorted to attempting to suppress the vote of Black voters and other voters of color in order to maintain the tenuous hold that the Republican Party has in Georgia,\u201d the lawsuit states. \u201cIn other words, these officials are using racial discrimination as a means of achieving a partisan end. These efforts constitute intentional discrimination in violation of the Constitution and Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act.\u201d The lawsuit was filed late Sunday in the US District Court for the Northern District of Georgia in Atlanta against Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger and members of the State Election Board. The Democrats\u2019 go-to election attorney, Marc Elias, had filed a lawsuit Thursday on behalf of the New Georgia Project, Black Voters Matter and Rise Inc. on similar grounds. \u201cIn large part because of the racial disparities in areas outside of voting \u2013 such as socioeconomic status, housing, and employment opportunities \u2013 the Voter Suppression Bill disproportionately impacts Black voters, and interacts with these vestiges of discrimination in Georgia to deny Black voters (an) equal opportunity to participate in the political process and/or elect a candidate of their choice,\u201d that lawsuit states. Still, the Georgia law is part of a larger effort by GOP legislators across the country \u2013 including in the battleground states of Michigan and Arizona \u2013 to roll back voting access in the wake of the 2020 election. Across the country, according to a February analysis by the liberal leaning Brennan Center for Justice, at least 253 bills have been introduced this year in 43 state legislatures with provisions that would restrict voting access \u2013 more than six times the number of bills for the same time last year.

            "article_content": "President Joe Biden and other Democrats could tackle both voting rights and infrastructure legislation at the same time, Democratic Sen. Raphael Warnock insisted Sunday, while White House shifts its focus to the country\u2019s infrastructure as his home state of Georgia has enacted a strict new voting law. \u201cWe can walk and chew gum at the same time. We\u2019ve got to work on the infrastructure of our country \u2013 our roads and our bridges \u2013 and we\u2019ve got to work on the infrastructure of our democracy,\u201d the Georgia senator told CNN\u2019s Dana Bash on \u201cState of the Union\u201d when asked whether Biden should prioritize voting rights over infrastructure.   \u201cI think the President is engaged on this issue,\u201d he added, referring to voting rights. \u201cAnd when I\u2019ve talked to him, he\u2019s agreed that voting rights are foundational \u2013 that this is the work we have to do.\u201d The comments from Warnock come three days after Georgia\u2019s Republican governor enacted into law a sweeping elections bill that imposes tight new voting restrictions, which the senator called an \u201cassault\u201d on democracy. Republican lawmakers in other states are also moving to pass bills with voting restrictions, something congressional Democrats have seized on in their push to take federal action on voting rights. But as Republicans in statehouses push to restrict voting access, the White House is shifting its focus to Biden\u2019s next key initiative after he signed the latest coronavirus stimulus package, with advisers prepping a two-part, $3 trillion proposal that would focus on jobs, infrastructure and clean energy, as well as what\u2019s being termed the \u201ccare economy\u201d that zeroes in on key domestic economic issues. Asked by Bash what his message would be on Sunday, Warnock, the senior pastor of Ebenezer Baptist Church, invoked a Biblical story to describe the GOP efforts to roll back voting rights. \u201cIt\u2019s Palm Sunday and Jesus confronts the powers and we all have a decision to make. There was a governor that he confronts in that moment named Pilate. And the governor has a decision to make,\u201d he said, tacitly referring to Georgia Republican Gov. Brian Kemp\u2019s recent signing of the election law. \u201cI think that all of us has a decision to make: are we going to stand on the side of truth and righteousness and justice? Are we going to stand up on the right side of history? This is a defining moment in the American nation and all of us have a role to play.\u201d The new law in Georgia, dubbed The Election Integrity Act of 2021, imposes voter identification requirements for absentee ballots, empowers state officials to take over local elections boards, limits the use of ballot drop boxes and makes it a crime to approach voters in line to give them food and water. Republicans in the state cast it as necessary to boost confidence in elections after the 2020 election saw former President Donald Trump make repeated, unsubstantiated claims of fraud. But Democrats, including Warnock, have sharply criticized the measure as voter suppression. The senator vowed Sunday \u201cto do everything I can to pass the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act and the For the People Act so that we can expand our democracy, rather than contract it,\u201d telling Bash: \u201cThe governor is taking us back, we intend to go forward.\u201d Analysis: Georgia's restrictive voting law puts the GOP at a crossroads Warnock also urged Georgians to vote during his Palm Sunday sermon at Ebenezer Baptist Church later Sunday. \u201cExercise your constitutional right to vote. \u2018Why are you talking about that on a Sunday morning, preacher?\u2019 Because your vote is your voice. Your voice is your human dignity. I believe that the right to vote, I believe that democracy, is the political enactment of a spiritual idea that all of us are children of the living God and more people than ever in Georgia stood up and said I want my vote,\u201d he said. The Georgia law is part of a larger effort by GOP-led legislatures across the country to pass restrictive voting measures in key states like Arizona, Michigan and Florida. As of February, state legislators in 43 states have introduced more than 250 bills with restrictive voting provisions, according to a tally from the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University. Democratic Rep. Jamaal Bowman of New York also blasted the new Georgia law on Sunday, telling CNN\u2019s Abby Phillip on \u201cInside Politics\u201d that its provisions are \u201cinhumane.\u201d \u201cWe need to make sure we give people better access to voting, not just in Georgia, but across the country and we can do that if we pass HR-1 and HR-4 in the Senate,\u201d he added, referring to voting rights bills passed in the US House of Representatives. Though Biden has also denounced Republican efforts to restrict voting in many states as \u201cun-American\u201d and \u201csick,\u201d comparing the efforts to Jim Crow laws that enforced racial segregation in the South, the White House is making plans to shift its focus to the nation\u2019s infrastructure.   The $3 trillion plan aides are working on would mark a sweeping move toward enacting the key elements of the \u201cjobs\u201d agenda that Biden laid out in large part during his campaign for president, with a suite of potential tax increases on corporations and the wealthy as options to finance any longer-term spending in the final proposal. The proposal would focus heavily on money for roads, bridges and rails, and would include hundreds of billions in spending for climate-related measures, as well as climate-related research and development. It also would include $100 billion for education infrastructure. The domestic economy piece of the plan, meanwhile, would include key Biden campaign priorities such as universal pre-K, significant spending on child care, care-giving and proposals designed to try and address portions of the workforce hit hardest by the pandemic economy. White House officials have stressed that no final decisions about the final path forward have been made at this point, and Biden still has to review the proposals and plans to consult heavily with Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi about the scale and legislative sequencing of the issue. This story has been updated with additional details Sunday.

            "article_content": "By passing one of the nation\u2019s most restrictive voting bills, Republican lawmakers in Georgia have forgotten a lesson from the past and are setting themselves up for defeat in the future. The sweeping bill, signed into law Thursday by Republican Gov. Brian Kemp, imposes new voter identification requirements for absentee ballots, limits the use of ballot drop boxes and makes it a crime to approach voters in line to hand them food and water. Kemp said the law allows Georgia to \u201ctake another step toward ensuring our elections are secure, accessible, and fair.\u201d Voting rights advocates, though, said it\u2019s a thinly disguised and racist attempt to suppress the Black vote. \u201cNo one but Pee Wee Herman believed them when they talked about the \u2018integrity of the vote,\u2019\u201d says the Rev. Tim McDonald, an Atlanta-based pastor who founded the African American Ministers Leadership Council. His group created \u201cSouls to the Polls,\u201d a get-out-the-vote movement among Black churches nationwide. Earlier versions of the Georgia elections bill would have virtually eliminated early Sunday voting, which is popular with Black voters. \u201cBlack folks are not stupid. We know their tricks. We know their motivation,\u201d McDonald says. \u201cThey are the [Ku Klux] Klan in three-piece suits.\u201d   What\u2019s happened in Georgia is part of a national trend. So far this year Republican lawmakers in more than 40 states have introduced more than 250 bills to restrict voting. But it may prove to be a clumsy political miscalculation. There\u2019s growing evidence to suggest that voter restriction laws sometimes backfire against their proponents. By attacking voting rights Georgia Republicans have abandoned a GOP political strategy that helped them win close elections. And they have angered a powerful bloc of Black voters in Georgia who have already mobilized against them. Consider one of Georgia Republicans\u2019 first big mistakes: targeting \u201cSouls to the Polls\u201d in earlier versions of their voting bill. Restrictive voting laws are more effective if they\u2019re dressed in race-neutral language such as \u201celection integrity\u201d or \u201cballot security.\u201d But the Georgia GOP floated proposals earlier this year to virtually eliminate early Sunday voting, which was seen as a direct attack on the Black electorate. Many Black churches ferry voters to the polls on Sundays during the early voting period. The \u201cSouls to the Polls\u201d tradition was launched in 1998 by McDonald, the Atlanta pastor, and a group of fellow church leaders. Members of the group had traveled to South Africa to witness the nation\u2019s first free elections and were inspired by the variety of early voting options offered there. They came up with the slogan over dinner at a Washington hotel. McDonald says that by targeting \u201cSouls to the Polls,\u201d Georgia Republicans didn\u2019t even try to disguise their hostility toward Black voters. \u201cThey know it\u2019s being perceived as racist, but they are so racist that they don\u2019t care,\u201d says McDonald, senior pastor of the First Iconium Baptist Church in Atlanta. Georgia Rep. Barry Fleming, who co-sponsored the voting bill and is chairman of the state legislature\u2019s Special Committee on Election Integrity, did not respond to an interview request from CNN. A spokesman for the Georgia Republican Party did not respond to a similar request for comment. Brad Raffensperger, Georgia\u2019s secretary of state, released a statement Friday saying the new Georgia law expands access to voting and offers new security measures. \u201cThe cries of \u2018voter suppression\u2019 from those on the left ring hollow,\u201d said Raffensperger, a Republican. \u201cI\u2019m a straight shooter. I call it like I see it. I did that to the chagrin of many in my own party when I spoke out against the false claim that Georgia has systematic voter fraud. And I\u2019m doing it now. \u201cTheir cataclysmic predictions about the effects of this law are simply baseless,\u201d he added. \u201cThe next election will prove that, but I won\u2019t hold my breath waiting for the left and the media to admit they were wrong.\u201d   But Raffensperger\u2019s words may do little to undo the Republicans\u2019 alienation of Black churchgoers, a group that the GOP used to court with notable success. Not long ago, the GOP saw Black church members as natural allies and aggressively encouraged them to vote. Black voters tend to skew liberal on politics but conservative on many social issues. Only 29% of Black voters consider themselves liberal, according to a 2020 Pew Research Center survey. President George W. Bush saw Black pastors as potential allies and launched an aggressive outreach to Black churchgoers with his brand of \u201ccompassionate conservatism\u201d during his two terms in office. Bush and the Republican Party appealed to Black voters by highlighting issues such as abortion, same-sex marriage and school vouchers. They also launched a faith-based initiative that provided grants for social services to Black churches. As Bush\u2019s political strategist Matthew Dowd once said: \u201cThe minister is the No. 1 influencer in the African American community.\u201d In return, Black churchgoers helped Bush win reelection in 2004. In Florida, for example, Bush received 13% of the Black vote \u2013 almost twice the 7% he received in 2000. And in Ohio that year, Bush more than doubled his share of Black voters from four years earlier. Republicans under Bush made such dramatic inroads with Black voters that GOP leaders talked boldly of a \u201crealignment\u201d that would begin with support from Black churches. Bush won 13% of the Black vote in 2004, but some Republicans talked about winning a quarter of the Black vote. Bush was appealing to a conservative tradition that has long existed in the Black community, says Jemar Tisby, author of \u201cHow to Fight Racism.\u201d Tisby is a historian who has written about the relationships between Black and White evangelical churches. Tisby alluded to a trend that surprised some observers of last year\u2019s presidential election. Former President Donald Trump won a larger share of the Black vote in 2020 than he did in 2016. Some traced his appeal to growing support from Black men. \u201cThere has always been a strand of Black people, particularly Black men, who have been enticed by the conservative rhetoric of the Republican Party,\u201d Tisby says. \u201cThe Republican talking points about individual responsibility and fiscal conservatism appeal to some Black religious folks who say we don\u2019t need a handout because we can create Black businesses and communities of our own.\u201d That strategy has since changed, Tisby says. \u201cI don\u2019t see the Republican Party trying to connect with the Black church (anymore),\u201d he says. \u201cThey\u2019re doing voter suppression so they don\u2019t have to reach out to Black voters.\u201d By supporting voter restrictions, Republicans are now alienating Black pastors such as Bishop Rudolph McKissick, Jr., senior pastor of the Bethel Church in Jacksonville, Florida, one the oldest and largest Black churches in the state. McKissick remembers when the Republican-controlled legislature in Florida passed laws in 2011 that eliminated early Sunday voting.  He says the move \u201cgalvanized his church.\u201d Pastors ramped up voter education and found creative new ways to get Black voters to the polls. It appears to have worked. In 2012, President Barack Obama received 196,657 votes in Duval County, where Jacksonville is located \u2013 more than 5,000 votes more than he got there four years earlier, before the state law was changed. Eight years later Joe Biden received 252,556 votes in Duval County, becoming the first Democratic presidential candidate to win the county in more than 40 years. McKissick believes the debate over \u201cSouls to the Polls\u201d and other proposed voter restrictions in Georgia may backfire. \u201cIt can, but only if Black leaders push the passion button on people and say we refuse to let them take us back to the days when we had no rights,\u201d he says. Black leaders won\u2019t have to push the passion button in Georgia, because that button was pressed a long time ago. Georgia has some of the most organized and mobilized groups of Black voters, thanks to Stacey Abrams, who may be the shrewdest and most tenacious voting rights advocate in the nation. Many of these Black voters remember when Abrams lost a close race for Georgia governor in 2018, a contest tainted by allegations of voter suppression. Kemp, Abrams\u2019 opponent, ran for governor while also holding onto his position as the state\u2019s chief elections officer \u2013 a position many viewed as a conflict of interest. The perception that the GOP is trying to suppress the Black vote will only make Black voters in Georgia more determined to vote in 2022, when Abrams is widely expected to run against Kemp again, says the Rev. Jamal Byrant, senior pastor of New Birth Missionary Baptist Church in Lithonia, Georgia. \u201cGeorgia is frankly becoming browner and more progressive, and the Republicans are having anxiety about the upcoming gubernatorial election and they\u2019re trying to do everything in their power to stop the wave,\u201d Bryant says. \u201cYou\u2019re going to see a whole lot of first-time voters, younger voters and disillusioned and disenfranchised voters heading back to the polls because they realize what\u2019s at stake,\u201d Bryant says. There is evidence to back up Bryant\u2019s prediction. A growing body of research suggests that the passage of voter ID laws may in some cases motivate Black voters and spark voter organizing efforts. One study examining the impact of the Supreme Court\u2019s 2013 Shelby decision, which gutted the Voting Rights Act, suggested that voting restrictions may actually increase Black turnout in elections. The Shelby decision made it easier for states to pass voter restriction laws after the high court removed the \u201cpreclearance\u201d provision from the Voting Rights Act. Under preclearance, a state with a history of racial discrimination in elections had to get permission from the federal government for instituting any changes to how they run elections. The study, which was cited in the New York Times, said the Shelby decision may have actually increased Black turnout in the 2016 presidential election in some states where preclearance was removed. \u201cOverall, the removal of preclearance did not decrease Black turnout,\u201d says Kyle Raze, a Ph.D. candidate at the University of Oregon, who authored the study. \u201cIf anything, the removal of preclearance increased Black turnout in some states during the 2016 election.\u201d Political scientists have found laws that make voting more difficult don\u2019t always succeed in changing election outcomes, because voters and parties take steps to counteract what\u2019s happening. McDonald, whose group coined \u201cSouls to the Polls,\u201d doesn\u2019t need a study to show him how resilient Black voters can be. He cites how Black voters reacted to another form of voter restrictions last year. The Black community in Georgia was hit hard by the Covid-19 epidemic, but Black voters still showed up in record numbers in November\u2019s election to turn Georgia blue. McDonald says what\u2019s happening in Georgia is part of a battle the Black church has been fighting for centuries \u2013 mobilizing Black people to fight for their equality. \u201cWe endured slavery, Jim Crow and lynching by being creative and strategic,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019re going to use their own tools and throw them back at them. We have to beat them at their own game.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Georgia\u2019s voter restrictions were dashed into law Thursday by Republicans shaken over recent election losses and lies about fraud from former President Donald Trump, yet the measures also developed against a backdrop of US Supreme Court decisions hollowing out federal voting rights protection. In another world, before the 2013 Shelby County v. Holder decision written by Chief Justice John Roberts, Georgia would have had to obtain federal approval for new election practices to ensure they did not harm Blacks and other minority voters. And at another time, before the Roberts Court enhanced state latitude in a series of rulings, legislators might have hedged before enacting policies from new voter identification requirements, to a prohibition on third-party collection of ballots to a rule against non-poll workers providing food or water to voters waiting in lines. But the conservative court has increasingly granted states leeway over how they run elections. Supreme Court conservatives want to topple abortion rights -- but can't seem to agree on how As the justices have turned away challenges to state policies, they have expressed sympathy for local officials who face potentially intrusive federal regulation and protracted litigation. Led by Roberts, the court has also dismissed concerns about the consequences for minority voters as it has curtailed the reach of the 1965 Voting Rights Act. \u201cOur country has changed,\u201d Roberts wrote in the Shelby County landmark, \u201cand while any racial discrimination in voting is too much, Congress must ensure that the legislation it passes to remedy that problem speaks to current conditions. \u2026 (V)oter registration and turnout numbers in the covered states have risen dramatically in the years since.\u201d   That case from Shelby County, Alabama, centered on a provision of the 1965 act that required states with a history of discrimination to seek approval from the Department of Justice or a federal court before changing electoral policy. By a 5-4 vote, the court invalidated the provision that still covered nine states, including Georgia. \u201cThe signal the conservatives on the court have sent is that they are willing to tolerate a lot of partisanship in how elections are run,\u201d said Professor Richard Hasen, at the University of California, Irvine, law school. \u201cThe question is whether things will change now that the 2020 elections showed how precarious our election system is and voter confidence is.\u201d He added: \u201cI think people are going to be looking to the Supreme Court for leadership and looking for it to go beyond partisanship.\u201d Supreme Court conservatives poised to uphold Arizona's curbs on voting The justices are now considering, in a recently argued Arizona case, the strength of a separate Voting Rights Act provision that prohibits any measure that denies someone the right to vote because of race. Unlike the \u201cpre-clearance\u201d provision previously in dispute, this section of the law comes into play after legislation has taken effect and puts the burden on those protesting the law to initiate a lawsuit. Resolution of that Arizona case, known as Brnovich v. Democratic National Committee, will have repercussions for controversy over laws like Georgia\u2019s, which were immediately challenged Thursday night by advocates who say they will disproportionately hurt Blacks. Across the country, Republican legislators have proposed voting changes that would reverse the pandemic-era steps that made it easier for people to vote last November, especially by mail, and led to record numbers of votes cast. Congress passed the 1965 Voting Rights Act soon after the Bloody Sunday march in Selma, Alabama. The law reflected the reality of the time that although the Fifteenth Amendment barred racial bias in voting, Blacks were still deterred from casting ballots through poll taxes, literacy tests and other rules. Who will be the next Antonin Scalia? Conservatives fight over his legacy Roberts highlighted how much he believes times have changed since then. \u201cIn 1965, the States could be divided into two groups: those with a recent history of voting tests and low voter registration and turnout, and those without those characteristics,\u201d he said. \u201cToday the Nation is no longer divided along those lines, yet the Voting Rights Act continues to treat it as if it were.\u201d Roberts has also made clear that he abhors remedies tied to race, saying in a 2006 voting-rights case: \u201cIt is a sordid business, this divvying us up by race.\u201d Yet in the aftermath of the polarizing 2020 election, the country and the high court may be headed for a new chapter of voting-rights cases of a deeper partisan character, intensifying concerns about the future of the Voting Rights Act, as well as First Amendment guarantees of free speech and association. Texas Republicans target Houston with raft of bills seeking new voting restrictions Georgia\u2019s law, signed by Gov. Brian Kemp on Thursday, emerges from Republican efforts nationwide, particularly in battleground states that experienced record turnout and Democratic victories last November. Among its myriad provisions, the Georgia law imposes new voter identification requirements for absentee ballots and empowers state officials to take over local election boards. The three voting rights groups that sued - the New Georgia Project, the Black Voters Matter Fund and Rise Inc. \u2013 grounded their complaint in the Voting Rights Act and in the First and Fourteenth Amendments. \u201cRather than promote public confidence in Georgia\u2019s elections and ensure election integrity,\u201d they asserted, the law \u201cwill make voting more difficult, result in disenfranchisement, and shatter voter confidence.\u201d It's now illegal in Georgia to give food and water to voters in line The challengers emphasized Georgia\u2019s history of racial discrimination. \u201c(V)oting in Georgia is highly polarized, and the shameful legacy of racial discrimination is visible today in Georgia\u2019s housing, economic, and health disparities,\u201d they wrote, adding that the new law \u201cinteracts with these vestiges of discrimination\u201d to deny equal opportunity in the political process. Lower federal court judges have struggled over the standard for assessing the denial of voting rights, and that dilemma is at the heart of the Supreme Court\u2019s new Arizona controversy. In dispute are laws require ballots cast by people at the wrong precinct to be discarded and bar most third parties \u2013 beyond a relative or mail carrier \u2013 from collecting absentee ballots, for example, at a nursing home. Here's why voting rights activists say Georgia's new election law targets Black voters During oral arguments, Roberts and fellow conservatives focused on potential voter fraud and highlighted state authority for overseeing elections. Arizona officials argued that the measures would help prevent voter coercion and other irregularities, as the challengers contended that the new requirements would especially disenfranchise Native Americans and other minorities. The high court\u2019s resolution of the Arizona controversy could have a dramatic impact on the raft of new legislation and ultimately how easy it is for minorities to register and vote. Resolution is expected by the end of June. \u201cThe Arizona case is going to be one of the most significant that the Roberts Court decides,\u201d said New York University law professor Richard Pildes. \u201cWe\u2019re about to learn much more about exactly of how the court understands the constitutional dimensions of the right to vote and the Voting Rights Act.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Former President Donald Trump\u2019s campaign of lies about a stolen election just delivered a huge victory with a new Georgia law that could suppress the votes of many of the citizens who helped eject him from the White House. Republican state lawmakers rushed through a broad law Thursday making it harder to vote that disproportionately targets Democratic and Black voters in a battleground vital to the 2020 election and future presidential and congressional contests. The move confirms the Peach State as the epicenter of the fight for American democracy that raged through Trump\u2019s presidency and during the insurrection he incited against the US Capitol \u2013 and now threatens to taint future elections as Republicans in multiple states pursue new laws to limit voting. \u201cWhat I\u2019m worried about is how un-American this whole initiative is. It\u2019s sick. It\u2019s sick,\u201d President Joe Biden said at the first news conference of his presidency that afternoon. The Georgia law raises the question of whether election safeguards that prevented Trump\u2019s energetic efforts to rig the 2020 White House race after the fact in the state will stand firm in future elections amid false claims of electoral fraud by a president.   It was drawn up after Democrats captured Georgia in the presidential election for the first time since 1992 amid massive turnout nationally as voting methods, including mail-in ballots, were expanded to make it easier for Americans to fulfill their fundamental democratic rights in a pandemic. Georgia Republicans also lost two US Senate seats that handed Democrats control of the 50-50 chamber on the basis of huge Black turnout in runoff elections in January. After leaving office, Trump demanded that Republican state legislatures pass laws to ban mail-in voting and to prevent courts from weighing in on electoral disputes. Using his massive popularity in the GOP, the former President has made the acceptance of his false conspiracy theories about voter fraud in 2020 a litmus test for Republican candidates seeking his support in upcoming primary elections. The ex-President is meanwhile intensifying his lies about the deadly assault on the US Capitol on January 6 as Congress was meeting to certify Biden\u2019s election victory. The invasion represented one of the most brazen attacks on democracy in US history. \u201cIt was zero threat, right from the start, it was zero threat. Look, they went in, they shouldn\u2019t have done it. Some of them went in, and they are hugging and kissing the police and the guards, you know, they had great relationships,\u201d Trump told Fox News on Thursday night. \u201cA lot of the people were waved in, and then they walked in and they walked out.\u201d The Georgia bill is only one example of GOP efforts in multiple states \u2013 including many crucial electoral battlegrounds \u2013 to not only build voter suppression on Trump\u2019s big lie but to hold back a diverse demographic tide in cities that favor Democrats, which critics see as an attempt to cement minority rule in the United States. Iowa has already passed a measure to limit absentee balloting and voting hours. Texas is taking steps to cut voting hours and absentee balloting in big Democratic cities like Houston. New voting laws are being pushed by Republicans in another swing state Trump lost, Arizona. GOP leaders justify the voter suppression measures by arguing that they are needed to crack down on fraud and to restore the public\u2019s faith that US elections are fair. But multiple courts and Trump\u2019s own Justice Department found there was no widespread electoral fraud in 2020. And voter mistrust was largely fueled by Trump\u2019s blatantly false claims that he had been cheated out of office in a corrupt election, which were incessantly broadcast by conservative media outlets. Georgia\u2019s action threw a political grenade into the debate over a Washington campaign by many Democrats to abolish Senate supermajority rules that Republicans could use to block their sweeping election bill, known as the For the People Act. The measure would establish national standards and reverse restrictions like those that are now the law of Georgia. Republicans brand the Democratic bill as an unconstitutional power grab. The drama in the Georgia Legislature unfolded as Biden condemned restrictive state legislation as a remnant of the Jim Crow era that institutionalized racism and hinted that he could ultimately back abolishing the Senate filibuster to get the Democrats\u2019 House-passed bill through the chamber. But Biden declined to reveal his strategy for getting the voting rights bill into law. The new law in Georgia requires more stringent voter verification requirements for absentee ballots, allows state officials to take over election boards and limits ballot drop boxes that make it easier for people to vote. The law allows any Georgian to make unlimited challenges to voter registrations, and, incredibly, makes it a misdemeanor crime for anyone to offer food and water to voters stuck in long lines to cast ballots. Black voters hampered by the restrictions of voting in urban areas have often found themselves lining up for hours to vote in inclement weather. The clear targeting of African American voters in Georgia and elsewhere recalls some of the ugliest racial episodes of America\u2019s past, and is fueling claims of open Republican racism. The Georgia law was quickly signed by Republican Gov. Brian Kemp, who incurred the wrath of Trump last year for refusing to play along with his attempt to override Biden\u2019s victory by 12,000 votes in the state, which was confirmed by several audits. Kemp claimed that the law \u201cmakes it easier to vote and harder to cheat.\u201d In a statement to CNN, Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, a Republican who defied Trump\u2019s pleas in a telephone call to find votes to overturn Biden\u2019s victory, said he would still stand up for voter freedoms but did not criticize the law. \u201cIn implementing this law, I will ensure that no eligible Georgia voter is hindered in exercising their right to vote, and I will continue to further secure our elections so that every Georgian can have confidence in the results of our elections,\u201d Raffensperger said. Earlier this week, Trump announced that he was backing Rep. Jody Hice in his effort to beat Raffensperger in a primary contest. Georgia state lawmaker arrested protesting voting restriction bill outside governor's office Kemp\u2019s swift signature on the law was another sign of the fierce pressure that Republican politicians who hope to have a political future face from Trump and his acolytes in their states. Kemp is up for reelection in 2022 and could face Democrat Stacey Abrams, a former state lawmaker and prominent voting rights advocate who played a crucial role in Biden\u2019s victory in Georgia. \u201cAs the FBI continue to round up seditionists who spilled blood to defend a lie about our elections, Republican state leaders willfully undermine democracy by giving themselves authority to overturn results they do not like,\u201d Abrams said in a statement. \u201cNow, more than ever, Americans must demand federal action to protect voting rights as we continue to fight against these blatantly unconstitutional efforts that are nothing less than Jim Crow 2.0.\u201d The Georgia law, which critics fear could allow state officials to deny counties the right to certify their own election results, and other measures suppressing the vote are likely to face rigorous challenges in court. Indeed, by Thursday evening, a suit challenging the Georgia law had already been filed by three voting rights groups. Damon Hewitt, acting president and executive director of the Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, a nonpartisan organization, said the measure directly targeted voters of color who took part in record numbers in the 2020 election. \u201cThis should be marked as Exhibit A in making the case that discriminatory voter suppression is alive and well, and makes clear why we need federal voting rights legislation to stop these laws in their tracks,\u201d Hewitt said. \u201cWe stand ready to take action and protect the fundamental right to vote through the courts.\u201d The For the People Act awaiting action in the Senate would create automatic voter registration nationwide and restore portions of the Voting Rights Act that were gutted by the Supreme Court. It would also strengthen mail-in voting and permit early voting across the country, while taking steps to cut wait times at the polls.",

            "article_content": "Republicans in Georgia sped a sweeping elections bill into law Thursday, making it the first presidential battleground to impose new voting restrictions following President Joe Biden\u2019s victory in the state. The bill passed both chambers of the legislature in the span of a few hours before Republican Gov. Brian Kemp signed it Thursday evening. By changing its election laws, \u201cGeorgia will take another step toward ensuring our elections are secure, accessible, and fair,\u201d he said.   Kemp, who is up for reelection next year, had refused to give in to former President Donald Trump\u2019s demands last year that he overturn Biden\u2019s victory \u2013 earning Trump\u2019s public condemnation. But on Thursday, Kemp said \u201calarming issues\u201d with the 2020 election demonstrated the need for change. He predicted critics of the new law \u201cwill threaten, boycott, sue, demonize and team up with their friends in the national media to call me everything in the book.\u201d The new law imposes new voter identification requirements for absentee ballots, empowers state officials to take over local elections boards, limits the use of ballot drop boxes and makes it a crime to approach voters in line to give them food and water. \u201cIt\u2019s like the Christmas tree of goodies for voter suppression,\u201d Democratic state Sen. Jen Jordan said on the Senate floor as lawmakers prepared to vote on the nearly 100-page bill Thursday. Republicans cast the measure, dubbed The Election Integrity Act of 2021, as necessary to boost confidence in elections after the 2020 election saw Trump make repeated, unsubstantiated claims of fraud. By Thursday evening, a lawsuit challenging the new law had already been filed by a trio of voting rights groups: the New Georgia Project, the Black Voters Matter Fund and Rise Inc. \u201cIn large part because of the racial disparities in areas outside of voting \u2013 such as socioeconomic status, housing, and employment opportunities \u2013 the Voter Suppression Bill disproportionately impacts Black voters, and interacts with these vestiges of discrimination in Georgia to deny Black voters (an) equal opportunity to participate in the political process and/or elect a candidate of their choice,\u201d the lawsuit states. Biden calls state GOP voting restrictions efforts 'sick' and 'un-American' The package is part of a national Republican effort that aims to restrict access to the ballot box following record turnout in the election. Biden, in his first White House press conference Thursday that he will \u201cdo everything\u201d in his power to halt efforts to restrict voting rights, saying that he thinks the efforts underway in state legislatures are \u201cun-American.\u201d Voting rights advocates say the state\u2019s rapid-fire action \u2013 and plans in other Republican-controlled states to pass restrictions of their own \u2013 underscores the need for federal legislation to set a national baseline for voting rules. Stacey Abrams, the founder of Fair Fight Action and a former Democratic gubernatorial nominee in Georgia, said the state\u2019s Republicans showed they were intent on \u201creviving Georgia\u2019s dark past of racist voting laws.\u201d \u201cNow, more than ever, Americans must demand federal action to protect voting rights,\u201d she said in a statement.The Georgia bill underwent major change in recent days \u2013 growing from a narrow, two-page bill into a sweeping omnibus package to becoming law in a little over week. Activists and Black religious leaders in the state held rallies and threatened corporate boycotts in an unsuccessful attempt to disrupt its progress through the General Assembly \u201cThey have rammed this through as quickly as possible,\u201d said Jonathan Diaz, an election lawyer with the Campaign Legal Center in Washington. \u201cI suspect because they know many of the provisions in this bill are not very popular.\u201d Advocates said they were alarmed by measures that will allow any Georgian to lodge an unlimited number of challenges to voter registrations and eligibility, saying it could put a target on voters of color. And Democrats in the Georgia Senate on Thursday lambasted measures that boot the secretary of state as chairman of the state elections board and allow lawmakers to install his replacement, giving lawmakers three of five appointments. Voting rights groups argue that granting the state new powers over county elections bucks the tradition of local control and could lead to a scenario in which state officials swoop in to prevent a county from certifying its election results. Another provision shortens the runoff cycle from the current nine weeks to just four weeks During Thursday\u2019s floor debate, Republican state Rep. Barry Fleming \u2013 a key architect of the new law \u2013 argued it would provide \u201cmore accountability\u201d to the election process in the state. Republicans scaled back some restrictive provisions from earlier iterations of the legislation, including a proposed repeal of no-excuse absentee voting. The bill is part of a larger effort by GOP-led legislatures across the country to pass restrictive voting measures in key states like Arizona, Michigan and Florida. As of February, state legislators in 43 states have introduced more than 250 bills with restrictive voting provisions, according to a tally from the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University. \u201cThis is nothing less than a concerted nationwide effort to restrict voting rights access to everyday Americans, but especially for voters of color and voters who are, quite frankly, more likely to support Democrats,\u201d Diaz of the Campaign Legal Center said. Officials with Heritage Action for America \u2013 one of the national Republican groups leading efforts to clamp down on ballot access in the name of \u201celection integrity\u201d \u2013 praised Kemp, lawmakers and the 20,000 conservative activists it said had lobbied lawmakers to pass the overhaul. Georgia\u2019s new law makes \u201cthe state a model for the rest of the country,\u201d Heritage officials said. The state\u2019s changing demographics had made the longtime Republican stronghold a key political battleground last year. Last November, Biden became the first Democrat in nearly three decades to win the state. And strong voter turnout in January helped send two Democrats to the US Senate, flipping control of the chamber to their party. One of those new senators, Raphael Warnock, captured his seat in a special election and will be on the ballot again in 2022. In that election, voter will confront broad changes. Voters will have to request absentee ballots 11 days before an election, rather than the Friday before Election Day as currently allowed. And voters who seek absentee ballots have to provide a copy of their identification or the number of their Georgia driver\u2019s license or state ID to both apply for and return the ballot. The also prohibits the secretary of state\u2019s office from sending unsolicited absentee ballot applications, as it did before the 2020 primaries due to the coronavirus pandemic.",

She will be officially sworn in on March 24, according to the city. \u201cI come to this day with life experiences different from the men who came before me,\u201d Janey wrote in a Boston Globe op-ed about her new role. When then-President-elect Joe Biden tapped Boston Mayor Marty Walsh to be his labor secretary in January, Walsh\u2019s departure meant Janey would become the city\u2019s acting mayor. As the Boston City Council president, Janey was next in line for the mayor\u2019s office. Janey officially became acting mayor at 9:01 p.m. Monday, after Walsh was confirmed by the Senate and then resigned from his role as mayor, according to the Dorchester Reporter. Janey will serve out the final year of Walsh\u2019s term ahead of an election this November. In the Globe, Janey promised \u201cbold, courageous leadership\u201d during her time in office, and in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic, a \u201ccitywide agenda of recovery, reopening and renewal.\u201d While the November mayoral race is expected to be contentious and draw a wide field of candidates, Janey has not announced a bid for a full four-year term as mayor. A lifelong Bostonian, Janey is a fourth-generation resident of the Roxbury neighborhood, a traditionally Black enclave. She also experienced Boston\u2019s tumultuous desegregation efforts firsthand. \u201cWhen I was just 11, school busing rolled into my life,\u201d Janey wrote in her op-ed. \u201cI was forced onto the front lines of the 1970s school desegregation battle. I faced rocks and racial slurs thrown at my bus, for simply attending school while Black.\u201d The Boston Foundation, a local philanthropic organization, called Janey\u2019s ascension \u201ca remarkable milestone for the city.\u201d In 2017, Janey was first elected to the Boston City Council to represent a district that includes Roxbury and parts of Fenway, the South End and Dorchester. Her victory then was also historic: She was the first woman ever elected to represent the district. \u201cToday is a new day for Boston,\u201d Janey said in the Globe. \u201cAs your mayor, I promise to bring my life experiences and passion to make this city better for everyone. I will strive to make positive change across our city.\u201d",

            "article_content": "If you\u2019re like me, you\u2019ve filled out an NCAA college basketball tournament bracket. Many Americans do, and it seems that taking part in the fun is one of the least controversial things you can do. There\u2019s a good reason for that. Even as most things in our society have become hyperpolarized, college basketball stands out as an exception. You can see this in a 2017 Washington Post poll. They asked respondents whether or not they were a fan of a lot of different sports, including college basketball. A very similar percentage of Democrats said they were a college basketball fan (41%) as did Republicans (39%). More recent polling back this up as well: Democrats and Republicans are about as likely to be college basketball fans. When we dig into Google trends, we see something similar. Back in late 2017, others and I looked at how different sports were searched in different media markets. With the exception of the NFL, no other sport tested had a lower correlation between the 2016 presidential election results and searches in a market. Just 2% of the variation in college basketball searches was explained by the presidential results. For comparison, 30% of the variation in NASCAR fandom was explained by the 2016 presidential election results. NASCAR fans were much more likely to be in regions where Republican Donald Trump did well. The 2016 presidential election results also had predictive value for other sports. They had eight times the explanatory value of college football fandom than it did college basketball. Like with NASCAR, Trump did better in college football friendly markets. The opposite was true of the NBA. Trump did significantly worse in markets where the NBA was more popular, which matches the poll of the NBA being a big Democratic sport. While the 2017 study did not look at the WNBA, polling over the last few years indicates that WNBA fans were more Democratic than fans of any other professional sport. Historically, the NFL was one of the least polarized sports leagues. Trump, however, lashed out against the players for kneeling during the national anthem to protest social injustices. A 2017 Gallup poll found that Democrats were 11 points more likely to be NFL fans than Republicans. A 2020 Marist College poll put the gap at a similar 8 points. Baseball was the other of the other big three sports in America that had a fairly low search correlation between Trump strength and Google searches. The polling backs this up: baseball fans are as likely to be Democrats as they are Republicans. The crossover between college basketball fans and baseball fans, however, is interestingly low. Just 36% of fans of either sport say they are fans of both of them in the Washington Post poll. This gets at another fact of life that can sometimes get lost: not all divides in this country are political, even if they\u2019re often related. They can be racial (i.e. college basketball fans are more likely to be Black than fans of sports in general) or regional. Baseball\u2019s strongest region is the Northeast, which happens to be one of college basketball\u2019s weakest regions. Just 25% of Northeasterners said they were college basketball fans in the Washington Post poll. This makes sense because with a few exceptions (e.g. The University of Connecticut), college basketball championships elude schools in the Northeast. On the other hand, the Boston Red Sox and New York Yankees have won a lot of World Series. This year doesn\u2019t look like it will be an exception for college basketball\u2019s ultimate winner. None of the teams thought to have any real shot of winning the tournament are in the Northeast. I guess we can always hope for some March Madness.",

            "article_content": "Republicans\u2019 response to losing control of the White House and Senate has been to try and make voting harder in a number of states. Most notably, perhaps, is Georgia, where they\u2019re going after ways of voting that were popular for Black voters and Democrats in 2020 (e.g. mail voting). Democrats and Black advocacy groups are, of course, up in arms and trying to stop the GOP. We can\u2019t know how these changes, if they come to pass, would affect future elections. But by looking at two of the most prominent moves Republicans are trying to make, we can see it\u2019s not at all clear that Republicans will succeed in helping their electoral prospects. Let\u2019s take a look at two ways of voting Republicans are trying to limit: vote by mail and early Sunday voting. Starting with vote by mail, Democrats are upset for a simple reason: they overwhelmingly won no-excuse absentee voting nationally and in Georgia. There\u2019s also a racial aspect to this in Georgia. The Brennan Center\u2019s Kevin Morris points out that Black voters were more than 5 points more likely to vote by mail than White people. When you try and limit no-excuse absentee voting to those 65 years and older (as some Republicans are trying to do in Georgia), you\u2019re limiting absentee voting to a whiter and more Republican crowd. The Georgia exit poll reveals that Donald Trump\u2019s vote share was 16 points higher among absentee voters 65 years and older than those under the age of 65. But as I noted previously, the idea that expanded absentee voting was responsible for Trump\u2019s defeat and President Joe Biden\u2019s victory nationally is far from clear. Democrats won a load of elections (including the 2018 midterms) in the Trump era when mail voting was far more limited than it was in 2020. There\u2019s nothing inherently Democratic about voting by mail. Democrats and Republicans did so at about equal rates in 2016. In Georgia, specifically, Trump actually won absentee voting by mail in 2016 by a few points. The higher use of absentee voting was more a product of the coronavirus pandemic than it was anything else. Democrats are far more likely to fear the virus, while Trump railed against mail voting. Further, the higher turnout this election likely wasn\u2019t because of mail voting. While we\u2019ll need more data to confirm this, the network exit polls showed that voters who were of voting age in 2016 and did not vote that year were actually less likely to vote by mail in 2020 (22%) than those who had voted by any method in the previous election (36%). They were far more likely to vote on Election Day in 2020 (49%) than those who had voted in 2016 (32%). Indeed, the state of Texas provides a very good case study for the effects of voting by mail in 2020. As Republicans are trying to do in Georgia, Texas limited no-excuse absentee voting to those 65 years and older. If no-excuse absentee voting were responsible for higher turnout, we would have seen a very large turnout boost between 64- and 65-year-olds in Texas. It didn\u2019t happen, according to a study from Stanford University. This finding holds when you control for partisanship. Voting by mail isn\u2019t the only thing Republicans are trying to stop. Not too surprising, they\u2019re going after Sunday early voting in the Peach State. Trump won early voting overall in the state, but Sunday early voting is quite popular with Black voters. They were nearly 10 points more likely to vote early in-person than other days of the week, while Whites were 13 points less likely. The eventual electorate effect of this move, if implemented, is not certain, however. Sunday early voters made up only about 72,000 of 5 million votes cast in the election. We don\u2019t know exactly how these groups cast a ballot, but we can estimate. We\u2019ll assume those White voters and voters of color who voted early on Sunday voted the same way as those who voted early overall in those demographic groups. With that estimate, Biden\u2019s margin would have shrunk by between about 6,000 and 7,000 votes. This would not have been enough to erase Biden\u2019s statewide win of a little less than 12,000. It is also fairly safe to assume at least some portion of those Sunday early voters would vote on other days of the week, if early in-person voting was disallowed on Sundays. We know at least some did in Florida\u2019s 2012 election, when some Sunday early voting was eliminated there after the 2008 election. This doesn\u2019t mean that what Republicans are doing in Georgia is right, and it doesn\u2019t mean that this time they won\u2019t help their chances. The bottom line is, though, that voters aren\u2019t static. What\u2019s often been found by political scientists is that moves that try to make voting more difficult don\u2019t succeed in changing election outcomes. The reason is that voters and parties make moves to try and counteract what\u2019s happening.",

            "article_content": "Chinese officials dismissed Secretary of State Antony Blinken and national security adviser Jake Sullivan as \u201ccondescending.\u201d An unnamed US official said the Chinese were \u201cgrandstanding.\u201d And with that, any chance the US and China might shift course after four turbulent years of the Trump administration quickly faded. The tense and unusual diplomatic clash Thursday between senior US and Chinese officials signals a tough road ahead as the world\u2019s two largest economies maneuver a relationship that is not going to improve easily or quickly, analysts said, and instead, may only get harder to navigate. The typically dull prelude to diplomatic meetings spiraled quickly out of control in part because of mismatched expectations and because both sides delivered speeches meant just as much for their domestic audiences as for their counterparts. Blinken and Sullivan finish 'tough and direct' talks with Chinese officials The Biden administration wants to maintain a tough line on China, particularly on areas of sensitivity for Beijing, such as human rights, and is not likely to ease up with China hawks in Congress ready to criticize any sign of weakness. Meanwhile, Beijing is intent on signaling that it is not intimidated by the US or swayed by American claims to global leadership. \u201cWe didn\u2019t expect to see anything in terms of substantive dialogue for the meetings, so the fact that they fell apart didn\u2019t surprise us, but the fact that they fell apart so quickly and in such spectacular pattern was really notable,\u201d said Cailin Birch, a global economist at the Economist Intelligence Unit. The testy start could make progress difficult in areas where the two nations have an interest in cooperating, such as trade, analysts said. \u201cOverall,\u201d Birch concluded, Thursday\u2019s meeting demonstrates that \u201cthere is little scope for an improvement in US-China relations in the near term.\u201d Blinken and Sullivan were in Anchorage to meet with China\u2019s foreign policy chief Yang Jiechi and State Councilor Wang Yi for two sessions on Thursday and a third on Friday. The event went awry right almost immediately when the two sides gathered for what is usually a ceremonial exchange of remarks before the press. After Blinken\u2019s description of Washington\u2019s \u201cdeep concerns\u201d about some of Beijing\u2019s human rights record and aggressive behavior overseas, Chinese officials ignored protocol to blast the US, the state of its democracy, and its record on racial justice. Blinken then countered with his own unscripted rebuttal. Both sides insisted cameras stay in the room to capture their remarks. Alaska dispute between US and Chinese officials an inauspicious start to a new era of relations The two US officials raised a slew of issues, ranging from ongoing repression in Xinjiang that Blinken has called genocide to China\u2019s cyber attacks. But the speeches were likely meant as much for audiences at home as for each other. \u201cA lot of it was probably theater for domestic audiences, there\u2019s definitely some of that for the US and some of that for China,\u201d Birch said. In a long set of remarks, Yang made clear that China feels the US has no right to meddle in its \u201cinternal\u201d affairs, claim a right to global leadership, or even to promote its vision for democracy and human rights, given the domestic controversy about the 2020 election and the injustices laid bare by US racial justice protests. \u201cThe US does not have the qualification to say it can speak from a position of strength,\u201d foreign policy chief Yang Jiechi scoffed. Pointing to the \u201cintensity\u201d and \u201cvociferousness\u201d of Yang\u2019s rebuttal, Birch said, \u201cit was probably meant to show China is not intimidated and it was a show of disrespect too \u2013 China is making clear that it\u2019s not going to follow the rules.\u201d A senior Republican aide suggested that Blinken and Sullivan were probably aware that lawmakers were watching too. \u201cThey cannot afford to give them an inch right now,\u201d this aide said of the Biden administration\u2019s approach to China. \u201cWe all know China is now the biggest issue geopolitically, especially for the Hill on foreign policy. They could not give an inch. They had to be strong, they had to be tough.\u201d It\u2019s not just Republicans the Biden administration has to be mindful of, the aide said. \u201cIf the administration is too weak on China,\u201d they said, \u201cyou may have a bipartisan group of people who may amp up and put restrictions on that effort, so there are domestic concerns they have to balance as well. The question is what happened behind closed doors.\u201d Staffers for the Senate Foreign Relations Committee have asked the administration for readouts of the meetings on Monday. Sullivan said Friday they had been \u201ctough\u201d and that he and Blinken would return to Washington to consult with Congress and allies on the talks. \u201cWe expected to have tough and direct talks on a wide range of issues, and that\u2019s exactly what we had,\u201d Sullivan said. Blinken said that, \u201con economics, on trade, on technology, we told our counterparts that we are reviewing these issues with close consultation with Congress, with our allies and partners, and we will move forward on them in a way that fully protects and advances the interests of our workers and our businesses.\u201d Another factor contributing to the friction was the very different expectations the two sides had about the meetings. \u201cChina was hoping for a reset and at least in theory was hoping to have one introductory, low-key meeting to set the tone,\u201d Birch said. \u201cObviously, with Blinken\u2019s comments, that possibility went out the window. The US team was coming in planning to discuss really sensitive issues for China \u2013 its human rights record and territorial ambitions.\u201d On Friday, President Joe Biden signaled that Blinken had his full backing, telling reporters he was \u201cvery proud\u201d of the top US diplomat after his verbal showdown with the Chinese officials. Stephen Orlins, president of the National Committee on United States-China Relations, said that Biden\u2019s message of \u201cunequivocal support\u201d proves that, \u201cthis administration is not like the previous administration and speaks with one voice on China \u2026 They are all reading from the same playbook.\u201d Insults fly as Biden locks horns with Russia and China By emphasizing the Biden administration\u2019s concerns about human rights and the threat China poses to smaller countries and US allies, Blinken and Sullivan also signaled that the Trump administration\u2019s transactional, trade-oriented, go-it-alone approach is over. Speaking to reporters on Friday, Blinken said he and Sullivan had two priorities for the talks. \u201cFirst: we wanted to share with them the significant concerns we have about a number of the actions that China\u2019s taken and the behavior it\u2019s exhibiting, concerns shared by our allies and partners. And we did that,\u201d said Blinken. \u201cWe also wanted to lay out very clearly our own policies, priorities, and worldview. And we did that too.\u201d Blinken and Sullivan emphasized that they\u2019ll continue to work with China on areas of mutual interest, including Iran, North Korea and Afghanistan, but climate \u201cis maybe the only real possibility for near term, substantial progress,\u201d Birch said. \u201cIt\u2019s the only real area where we see the two countries being aligned and where their partnership would spin well for both governments, whereas even a sign of cooperation on trade would be hard to sell at home, especially in the US.\u201d",

            "article_content": "A former chief of Washington, DC\u2019s police force on Thursday condemned Sen. Ron Johnson after the Wisconsin Republican last week suggested that he would have felt less safe during the January 6 Capitol riot if the protesters supported the Black Lives Matter movement and Antifa instead of being largely White. \u201cSen. Johnson is clearly part of the problem,\u201d Former DC Police Chief and CNN Law Enforcement Analyst Charles Ramsey told CNN\u2019s Jim Sciutto and Poppy Harlow on \u201cNewsroom.\u201d \u201cThose comments were racist. Now if you ask him, he\u2019ll say, \u2018Oh, no racial overtones at all.\u2019 It\u2019s ridiculous. He is part of the problem, and he is not alone.\u201d Appearing on the radio talk show \u201cThe Joe Pags Show\u201d last week, Johnson said, \u201cEven though those thousands of people that were marching to the Capitol were trying to pressure people like me to vote the way they wanted me to vote, I knew those were people that love this country, that truly respect law enforcement, would never do anything to break the law, and so I wasn\u2019t concerned.\u201d He was discussing his recent comments downplaying the danger that day and he has said he \u201cnever really felt threatened.\u201d \u201cNow, had the tables been turned \u2013 Joe, this could get me in trouble \u2013 had the tables been turned, and President Trump won the election and those were tens of thousands of Black Lives Matter and Antifa protesters, I might have been a little concerned,\u201d Johnson continued. January 6 fallout: Congress stalls on independent probe while House GOP-Capitol security tension grows Johnson, who has repeatedly made incendiary comments mischaracterizing the riots, has denied that his remarks about the protesters were racist. \u201cThis isn\u2019t about race, this is about riots,\u201d he said earlier this week. \u201cIt\u2019s still pretty shocking that it would take what I consider completely innocuous comment and turn it into, you know, use the race card on me and say there\u2019s some kind of racist comment involved in that there was none.\u201d In the wake of the riot, some conservatives have sought to draw a false equivalency between the violence of January 6 and the unrest that took place over the summer in the wake of several high-profile police killings of Black Americans. Although there were incidents of violence and property destruction last summer, the January riot at the Capitol resulted in five deaths, including a Capitol Police officer, and more than 100 other police officers were injured. Johnson has also advanced the conspiracy theory that there had been professional provocateurs within the mob at the Capitol. The FBI has said there is no evidence that Antifa or any other groups of leftist instigators were part of the January 6 crowd \u2013 much less were the ones inciting violence \u2013 and nearly a dozen Trump supporters charged in connection with the insurrection have said that such groups weren\u2019t involved in the attack. Many of the people arrested identify with far-right groups like the Oath Keepers, not with any groups on the far left. Ramsey on Thursday said comments such as the ones made by Johnson contribute to recent violence and an uptick in hate crimes in the US. \u201cIt goes beyond just our House and our Senate.\u201d he said. \u201cI mean, the rise in hate crimes in this country \u2013 whether it\u2019s directed toward Asian Americans, African Americans, Latinos, it doesn\u2019t matter \u2013 we have to take a stand against it. It\u2019s just something that can\u2019t be tolerated anywhere in this country. But to hear it come from an elected official, a senator, I mean that pretty much says it all.\u201d CNN\u2019s Caroline Kenny contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "The massive stimulus plan President Joe Biden signed last week sets up a critical real-world test of an argument that has divided political professionals for decades: Can Democrats win back White working-class voters drawn to conservative Republican messages on culture and race by offering them more tangible economic benefits? Social policy experts say the $1.9 trillion bill will channel more direct government financial assistance to families on the middle and lower rungs of the income ladder than any single piece of legislation since at least President Lyndon Johnson\u2019s Great Society during the 1960s \u2013 and possibly well before that. Irwin Garfinkel, one of the nation\u2019s leading social policy scholars and co-director of the Center on Poverty and Social Policy at Columbia University, says that in terms of putting a short-term infusion of cash into the pockets of families at or below the median income \u2013 particularly through a historic expansion and reconfiguration of the child tax credit \u2013 the bill\u2019s immediate impact compares favorably even to the crowning achievement of President Franklin D. Roosevelt\u2019s New Deal. \u201cIt ranks historically right up there next to the Social Security Act,\u201d says Garfinkel. \u201cAnd in terms of children, maybe even bigger than the Social Security Act in the actual short-term outcomes.\u201d Stimulus payments hitting some Americans' bank accounts Though the bill directs its greatest benefits, in percentage terms, toward the lowest-income families \u2013 reversing the priorities of the tax cut that President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans passed in 2017 \u2013 it also showers substantial assistance on families well into the middle class through that expanded child tax credit, the $1,400-per-person direct stimulus checks, expanded federal unemployment benefits and much larger subsidies for purchasing health insurance through the Affordable Care Act, among other provisions. That means those directly benefiting from the law will include millions of the working-class White families who have become the bedrock of the Republican electoral coalition; just considering the expanded child tax credit, one recent study by the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, a liberal policy analysis and advocacy group, found that White kids will compose about half of the roughly 65 million beneficiaries nationwide, and a clear majority of those receiving the enhanced benefits in key Rust Belt states such as Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, Ohio and Iowa. The vast scale of this material assistance to financially strained families of all races will test whether any conceivable set of government economic benefits can loosen the GOP\u2019s hold on working-class Whites \u2013 or the modest but measurable gains that Trump recorded in the 2020 race among working-class Hispanics and even some Black voters (especially men in each case). Working class White voters \u2013 usually defined as Whites without four-year college degrees \u2013 were the cornerstone of the \u201cNew Deal\u201d coalition assembled by Roosevelt, which dominated American politics from 1932 through 1968. But since the mid-1960s, the defection of those blue-collar White voters \u2013 heavily concentrated among Catholics in Northern states, evangelical Protestants in Southern states and rural residents in both regions \u2013 to the GOP has been a constant source of frustration and anxiety for Democrats. If it becomes permanent \u2026 the child tax credit is a potentially landmark achievement that is up there with the ACA, with things that Lyndon Johnson did, Franklin Roosevelt did. It\u2019s a history book achievement. Chuck Marr, senior director of federal tax policy, Center on Budget and Policy Priorities In Election Day exit polls conducted by a consortium of media organizations going back to 1980, no Democratic presidential candidate has carried most of those non-college White voters except for President Bill Clinton in 1996, who won a razor-thin 44% plurality of them in a three-way contest that included independent candidate Ross Perot. The 2016 exit polls conducted by Edison Research for a consortium that included CNN showed Trump crushing Hillary Clinton among them by 66% to 29% \u2013 the strongest showing with those voters for any candidate in either party since Ronald Reagan in 1984. Other post-election studies of the 2016 vote showed comparable deficits for the Democrats. In the 2020 election, Biden \u2013 an older White Catholic who projected a culturally compatible \u201cScranton Joe,\u201d working-class image \u2013 recovered only modestly with these blue-collar White voters: The exit polls showed Trump still beating him with them by 67% to 32%. (The VoteCast analysis from The Associated Press and the National Opinion Research Center gave Trump only a slightly narrower 30-point advantage.) The exit polls did show Biden recording bigger gains in the critical states of Wisconsin and Michigan \u2013 where he won about two-fifths of these voters, compared with about one-third for Hillary Clinton. But Biden remained mired at about one-third support among them in Pennsylvania and Ohio, and Democrats\u2019 failure to win more of these voters was a critical factor in their Senate defeats in states including Maine, Iowa and North Carolina. For decades, many Democratic strategists have argued that a key to regaining support among White working-class voters is to deliver them material economic assistance as a means of dispelling the widespread belief among them that government cares mostly about the poor (a view spiked with racial animosities linked to stereotypes such as \u201cthe welfare queen\u201d). The conviction that Democrats needed to demonstrate such concern about working- and middle-class families, for instance, helped drive the mammoth political struggles by Bill Clinton and President Barack Obama to expand access to health insurance. But neither effort fulfilled that political aim (though Obama, succeeding where Clinton failed, passed his Affordable Care Act into law). In each case, polls showed that Republicans persuaded many White voters to view the Democrats\u2019 health care proposals as a kind of welfare program that imposed new obligations on them while mostly benefiting poor people. White voters then keyed enormous gains for the GOP in the midterm elections immediately after the congressional struggles over Clinton\u2019s and Obama\u2019s health care plans, with those without college degrees leading the stampede away from Democrats each time. With every congressional Republican opposing the new stimulus plan, some in the GOP have already signaled their intent to reprise these arguments. Sens. Mike Lee of Utah and Marco Rubio of Florida, for instance, have portrayed the expanded child tax credit \u2013 which will provide $3,600 annually per child younger than 6 and $3,000 for those aged 6-17, regardless of whether the parent is working \u2013 as a handout that reverses the welfare revisions of the 1990s. Here's what you need to know about the new stimulus child tax credit \u201cThat is not tax relief for working parents; it is welfare assistance,\u201d the two insisted in a joint statement last month. \u201cAn essential part of being pro-family is being pro-work. Congress should expand the Child Tax Credit without undercutting the responsibility of parents to work to provide for their families.\u201d But the breadth of the stimulus bill\u2019s assistance will complicate those efforts. It makes the child tax credit available at that full amount to married couples earning up to $150,000 annually, a huge swath of American families. The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities calculates that 90% of American children will receive at least some increased assistance from the law. Just by itself, the group calculates, the new law will reduce the number of children in poverty by 4.1 million; by comparison, the combined effect of the existing child tax credit and the Earned Income Tax Credit for low-income working families, policies that have been in place for decades, reduces the number of poor kids by about 5.5 million, notes Chuck Marr, the group\u2019s senior director of federal tax policy. \u201cIn one law, one fell swoop, you are doing the equivalent of decades worth of policy gain,\u201d Marr told me. This rescue plan isn\u2019t solving somebody else\u2019s problem; it\u2019s solving everyone\u2019s problem. People are not going to view this as a zero-sum policy solution where somebody else is benefiting and they are losing. Instead, they view this as a rescue from a pandemic where everyone was losing. Jesse Ferguson, Democratic consultant In figures provided exclusively to CNN, the Institute on Taxation and Economic Policy, which generally advocates for a more progressive tax code, similarly calculated that households headed by Whites will make up 67% of those receiving the bill\u2019s direct cash payments, 64% of those benefiting from its expanded child tax credit and 62% benefiting from its enhancements to the Earned Income Tax Credit. Families in the middle of the income distribution (two-thirds of whom are White) will see their income rise by nearly 7% as a result of the bill, while families with children in that income bracket will receive even more assistance, the group calculates. A married couple earning about $40,000 annually with one child at home, the group projects, could see their income rise by nearly $6,000, a 15% increase. And even this doesn\u2019t exhaust the bill\u2019s potential benefits for middle-income and working families. It also includes substantial food and housing assistance, and above all it expands eligibility for subsidies to purchase health insurance under the ACA to more middle-income families and increases the size of the subsidies available to them. The Center on Budget and Policy Priorities calculates that a family of four earning $50,000 annually would see its premiums on the ACA marketplace plummet from $252 to $67 per month, while a family of four earning $110,000 annually would experience a reduction from $1,445 to $666 per month. Rarely, if ever, has a single piece of federal legislation provided so much direct financial assistance to so many families, particularly those in the bottom half of income distribution. \u201cI think this is by far the largest,\u201d Marr says. The big caveat to that judgment is that the bill\u2019s key provisions \u2013 particularly the child tax credit and increase in ACA subsidies \u2013 are only temporary. But, Marr adds, \u201cif it becomes permanent \u2026 the child tax credit is a potentially landmark achievement that is up there with the ACA, with things that Lyndon Johnson did, Franklin Roosevelt did. It\u2019s a history book achievement.\u201d Garfinkel at Columbia agrees. \u201cIt may be the biggest single increase that we\u2019ve ever had,\u201d he says, in direct government assistance to families at the median income or below. But what makes the legislation especially distinctive, he says, is that it doesn\u2019t stop there; it spreads benefits well into the middle class. \u201cThere is no question that the big beneficiaries are those at the bottom, but it\u2019s also quite different from the ACA and other Democratic Party efforts that focus programs only on the poor,\u201d he says. \u201cWe\u2019ve limited and targeted benefits. Even the Earned Income Tax Credit is incredibly targeted at the bottom, food stamps even more so, [welfare] was even more. But the child allowance is going to be a near-universal program and in the short term people well into the middle class will benefit.\u201d Is the GOP's extremist wing now too big to fail? Not only the breadth of the bill but also the extent of the distress that prompted it could change the political equation. Virtually all Americans had their lives disrupted in some ways from the pandemic, which could make it much more difficult for Republicans to paint the stimulus plan as a response to \u201csomebody else\u2019s problem\u201d \u2013 which was, in effect, the label they initially attached to the ACA and Obama\u2019s 2009 stimulus plan. Because even so many Republican-leaning White voters \u201cwere desperate [and] so on the edge,\u201d amid the economic devastation of the pandemic, \u201cI think they are going to struggle to turn it into welfare,\u201d says Stanley B. Greenberg, a veteran Democratic pollster. John Brabender, a longtime Republican consultant who has often directed races in heavily blue-collar states such as Pennsylvania, agrees the GOP needs to be cautious about portraying the plan as a form of welfare. \u201cThat\u2019s a dangerous message because there\u2019s a lot of hard-working people [benefiting from it] and the last thing they want to do is think of this as welfare,\u201d he says. Early polling finds that the public\u2019s first reaction is to see the plan providing broadly shared benefits. A CBS/YouGov national survey released Sunday found that more than two-thirds said the plan was likely to benefit Black and Hispanic communities, but roughly three-fifths said it would benefit Whites, the nation\u2019s economy overall, rural areas and, most important, people like them. Though Whites without college degrees are usually the principal audience for Republican efforts to portray Democratic initiatives as welfare, they were as likely as Hispanics (and more likely than Whites with college degrees) to agree in the survey that the plan would benefit them personally. Just as important, all of those numbers were more favorable for the plan than polling released a few days earlier by the Navigator project, a Democratic polling consortium; that suggests the plan might be growing more popular as Americans hear more about it. \u201cThis rescue plan isn\u2019t solving somebody else\u2019s problem; it\u2019s solving everyone\u2019s problem,\u201d says Jesse Ferguson, a longtime Democratic consultant who advises the Navigator project. \u201cPeople are not going to view this as a zero-sum policy solution where somebody else is benefiting and they are losing. Instead, they view this as a rescue from a pandemic where everyone was losing.\u201d Largely agreeing, Brabender suggests Republicans focus less on attacking the stimulus plan head-on than on trying to shift the subject to issues where more GOP-leaning voters \u2013 particularly those blue-collar Whites \u2013 distrust Democratic priorities. That instinct was evident during the stimulus debate, when Republican House leaders such as Kevin McCarthy of California and Liz Cheney of Wyoming made only token efforts to discredit the bill and instead pivoted to condemning alleged censorship of Dr. Seuss and the growing number of unaccompanied minors arriving at the US border. Brabender says the flow of liberal priorities rapidly passing through the House \u2013 on issues from gun control to police and election revisions to LGBTQ equality \u2013 will provide Republicans plenty of targets next year to win back culturally conservative voters, even those who might welcome help from the stimulus bill. Democrats, Brabender says, \u201cdon\u2019t realize\u201d how much trouble they will have with some of these congressional votes, particularly in districts or states with large numbers of blue-collar voters. \u201cWhat seems like a safe vote at the moment may not be as safe as they think it is,\u201d he says. Why the GOP's cancel culture pitch is good politics That could produce a 2022 election season organized around familiar coordinates, with Democrats portraying themselves as defending working- and middle-class families\u2019 economic interests while Republicans target their cultural values (and, in the case of White families, their sense of racial identity). While advancing an aggressive agenda on social and racial issues, Democrats may try to keep the focus, as much as possible, on their direct economic assistance to working families. It\u2019s virtually certain that Democrats, before the 2022 elections, will seek to make permanent at least the expansion of the child tax credit and the ACA subsidies. And in that process, Greenberg notes, Democrats will likely create another sharp contrast by proposing to pay for those benefits partly through repealing elements of the Trump/GOP tax cut that benefited corporations and top earners \u2013 an argument that may appeal precisely to the blue-collar White voters drawn to Republicans on racial and cultural grounds. \u201cThese voters are strongly for raising taxes on the rich; Republicans will fight it,\u201d says Greenberg, whose wife, Democratic Rep. Rosa DeLauro of Connecticut, was a principal sponsor of the child tax credit. \u201cThat\u2019s another part of the battle for the midterm. Biden doesn\u2019t have a populist side, but he will on taxes. Having cut [working class families\u2019] taxes and having raised them on the rich, Biden is going to look like an economic populist.\u201d The number of Whites without college degrees has been steadily shrinking for decades, as a share of both society and the electorate. Yet because of their large numbers in states at the tipping point of both the Electoral College and the battle for Senate control, they retain a disproportionate political influence. With Republicans in the Trump era so explicitly voicing many of those voters\u2019 racial and cultural anxieties, Democrats are resigned to the GOP holding a clear majority of them, even after they receive the substantial material assistance in the stimulus plan. But given the Democrats\u2019 improving performance with college-educated White voters, and the growing presence in the electorate of the racially and religiously diverse younger millennials and Generation Z, the party would need only modest improvement with these working-class Whites to significantly fortify their electoral position. \u201cWhat matters here are small numbers,\u201d says Greenberg. The sweeping stimulus plan may constitute the party\u2019s best chance in years to achieve small blue-collar gains that could have big political consequences.",

He said a year ago that the economy had to fully re-open in spite of the coronavirus. And, he\u2019s insisted that the deaths from the virus are necessary sacrifices to keep the economy up and running. And late last week, Johnson did it again. Again. Here\u2019s Johnson on with conservative talk radio host Joe Pags : \u201cEven though those thousands of people that were marching to the Capitol were trying to pressure people like me to vote the way they wanted me to vote, I knew those were people that love this country, that truly respect law enforcement, would never do anything to break the law, and so I wasn\u2019t concerned\u2026 \u201d \u2026 Now, had the tables been turned \u2013 Joe, this could get me in trouble \u2013 had the tables been turned, and President Trump won the election and those were tens of thousands of Black Lives Matter and Antifa protesters, I might have been a little concerned.\u201d (Sidebar: If you hear yourself saying \u201cthis could get me in trouble,\u201d stop speaking. Immediately. Just close your mouth mid-sentence. Trust me on this.) THE POINT -- NOW ON YOUTUBE! \nIn each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe! Now, what ever could be the difference between the rioters that stormed the Capitol and those who populated the Black Lives Matter protests over the summer? What. Could. It. Be. It certainly wasn\u2019t the level of violence exhibited by the two groups. Because the US Capitol riot left five people dead and dozens more injured, with images and videos emerging in the aftermath of rioters attacking police officers, a gallows being constructed in front of the Capitol building and people chanting things like \u201cHang Mike Pence.\u201d And of course, only one of the two groups actually penetrated one of the most prominent symbols of the democracy in this country, ransacking it in the process. But Johnson said he \u201cnever really felt threatened\u201d even as rioters were pouring into the Capitol because they were \u201cpeople that love this country\u201d and \u201cthat truly respect law enforcement.\u201d (Johnson must have missed all of the footage of rioters attacking the police \u2013 both physically and verbally.) So what could the difference be then? Since it seems that, on every measure, that the riot at the US Capitol was far more dangerous? Simple: The vast majority of rioters on January 6 were White. The crowds at the Black Lives Matter protests in the summer of 2020 were not predominantly White. That\u2019s it. That\u2019s the difference Johnson is talking about. He wasn\u2019t worried about being in danger from the demonstrably dangerous group of rioters on January 6 because they, like him, were White. But he would have been worried if it was the (mostly peaceful) demonstrators at the BLM rallies because they were Black. On Monday, Johnson defended his comments and said he was the real victim: \u201cThere is nothing racial about my comments. Nothing whatsoever. This isn\u2019t about race, this is about riots. \u2026 The few of us that have pushed back on that, we get mercilessly attacked, I mean I was, I was quite honestly, I wasn\u2019t \u2013 I wasn\u2019t surprised, but it\u2019s still pretty shocking that it would take what I consider completely innocuous comment and turn it into, you know, use the race card on me and say there\u2019s some kind of racist comment involved in that there was none.\u201d That double standard is striking \u2013 and informed by racist stereotyping. That it was uttered by a sitting US senator is shameful.",

            "article_content": "For the Democratic left, President Joe Biden\u2019s mammoth victory on Covid relief has inspired new hope of rebalancing America\u2019s increasingly unequal economy. Nothing will test that hope more severely than Biden\u2019s goal of reinvigorating the labor movement as a way to do it. His aspiration to be \u201cthe most pro-union president you\u2019ve ever seen\u201d stems from his upbringing in post-World War II Scranton, Pennsylvania, where he witnessed the early stage of Rust Belt decline. Labor movement experts see early evidence of commitment in a recent video he recorded affirming the right to organize as Amazon workers in Alabama vote on whether to form a union. \u201cArguably the most pro-union public statement by a president\u2026in the entirety of American history,\u201d tweeted Erik Loomis, a labor historian at the University of Rhode Island. \u201cNothing like it before,\u201d agreed Nelson Lichtenstein, who directs the Center for the Study of Work, Labor and Democracy at the University of California/Santa Barbara.   The question is whether even a supportive president can reverse the decline in union power that economists say has helped hollow out America\u2019s middle class. Neither organized labor nor sympathetic politicians have managed to do that for decades. Labor union membership peaked in the 1950s, as Biden became a teenager, at just over one-third of the workforce. Ever since, an interconnected array of economic, cultural and political factors has driven that proportion down to just over 10% overall, and even lower among private-sector workers. The decline, propelled by business executives and conservative politicians who consider unions a drag on profits and growth, has occurred in advanced economies around the world. Republican President Ronald Reagan punctuated it in the US by firing striking members of the air traffic controllers union in 1981. But Democratic commitment to the union cause has also waned with labor\u2019s dwindling power. For votes and campaign donations, the party\u2019s candidates have increasingly relied on more affluent, socially liberal professionals and rising economic sectors such as Silicon Valley. Accommodating the imperatives of globalization, Democratic Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama backed major trade expansion agreements. Biden himself voted for both the North American Free Trade Agreement and normal trade relations with China. Recent union-backed attempts to boost worker pay, safety and organizing have made only limited headway. The Clinton administration\u2019s \u201cergonomic\u201d regulation to protect workers from repetitive stress injuries got rolled back under President George W. Bush. \u201cCard-check\u201d legislation permitting union elections by signature card rather than secret-ballot election foundered in Congress under Obama. Trump diluted Obama-era regulations expanding eligibility for overtime pay. In a ballot initiative last November, Californians voted to let ride-share companies classify drivers as contractors rather than employees with job benefits. Yet each of the two most recent presidents, in different ways, highlighted contemporary working class struggles. Trump appealed most emphatically to the cultural resentments of blue-collar Whites. Biden invokes the economic plight of workers across racial lines. Union leaders say that presents an opening with Democrats now controlling Congress and the White House. \u201cYou cannot fix inequality of wealth until you fix inequality of power,\u201d said AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka. \u201cOf all the presidents I\u2019ve been around, Joe Biden understands the importance of collective bargaining in restoring the balance.\u201d So far, Biden has fired the Trump-appointed general counsel for the National Labor Relations Board and signed executive orders bolstering workplace safety and wages paid on federal projects. He shielded teachers unions from pressure to reopen schools before educators get vaccinated. Here's why 2021 could be a big year for labor unions His Covid relief bill is sending $350 billion in aid to state and local governments, diminishing the threat of layoffs among unionized public employees. It\u2019s sending $86 billion to bail out financially strapped union pension plans, safeguarding benefits for more than 1 million retirees. Biden hasn\u2019t joined Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, a 2020 Democratic rival, in backing legislation to let workers select 40% of directors on corporate boards. But he has called for doubling the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour, hired a raft of left-leaning economic advisers and nominated former union President (and Boston Mayor) Marty Walsh as labor secretary. White House officials say it all represents a chance to enhance labor\u2019s clout. They acknowledge modest expectations on lifting union membership. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to get to one-third overnight,\u201d said Seth Harris, deputy director of the National Economic Council and previously Obama\u2019s acting labor secretary. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to get to 20% overnight. But growth is possible.\u201d Biden backs the legislative answer favored by congressional Democrats. The Protecting the Right to Organize Act even drew five Republican votes as it passed the House last week. But its only realistic chance of enactment lies with ending the Senate filibuster, which requires 60 votes to advance legislation. Democrats have just 50 senators. \u201cI\u2019m not sure that it\u2019s possible to get 10 Republican votes for the PRO Act,\u201d said American Federation of Teachers President Randi Weingarten. Pro-labor lawmakers insist Biden can make progress by shifting public attitudes even without the legislation. In an Oval Office visit, Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown of Ohio thanked the new President for merely uttering the word \u201cunion\u201d so often. \u201cJust like Trump\u2019s racism made it more likely racists would speak up,\u201d Brown explained, \u201cBiden\u2019s speaking about unions has really made people sit up and think, \u2018This is a really important part of our country.\u2019 \u201c The Amazon union vote, which concludes March 29, will provide one early measurement. A breakthrough at the tech behemoth, labor advocates say, would be the modern equivalent of organizing unions at manufacturing titans Ford and US Steel a century ago. The effort drew an unexpected endorsement last week from conservative Sen. Marco Rubio, a Florida Republican who\u2019s a potential 2024 presidential hopeful. But repeated disappointments still temper labor\u2019s expectations about the outcome. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t exactly call it optimism,\u201d observed Loomis. \u201cWe don\u2019t allow a lot of optimism.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Georgia Republicans have advanced a sweeping bill in the state Senate that further restricts voting \u2013 keeping a state that was pivotal to the 2020 elections at the forefront of the GOP backlash against expanded voting. The expansive package, which passed by a narrow margin Monday, would repeal no-excuse absentee voting for many Georgians \u2013 a method 1.3 million of the state\u2019s residents used to cast ballots in last November\u2019s general election. The measure now moves to the Georgia House, which has passed its own slate of proposed voting restrictions. The developments in Georgia come amid a flurry of activity around the country by Republican-controlled legislatures to make it harder to vote after the GOP lost the presidency and the US Senate majority in the 2020 elections. On Monday, Iowa became one of the first states to enact new restrictions as the Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds signed a new law that makes it harder to vote early. But Monday\u2019s vote in the Peach State \u2013 which came on the final day that the Senate could send its voting package to the state House for consideration \u2013 also underscored fresh tensions building among Republicans over how much to restrict paths to the franchise. Republican grassroots activists mounted a weekend campaign to ensure the bill\u2019s passage. In the end, the measure survived by only a one-vote majority of the Senate\u2019s 56 senators, once abstentions were taken into account. And the No. 2 GOP official in Georgia, Lt. Gov. Geoff Duncan, opted to boycott Monday\u2019s debate. Voting-rights groups also have vowed to bring pressure on legislators in the weeks to come to keep the state from rolling back an array of voting policies that helped drive a record number of Georgians to the polls amid the coronavirus pandemic in the 2020 general election and Senate runoff elections. The efforts to restrict voting come after the traditionally red state backed Democrat Joe Biden for the presidency last year and sent two Democrats to the US Senate, Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff. CNN analysis: Georgia's proposed weekend voting restrictions would strike at Black voters The ACLU of Georgia executive director Andrea Young said her group would use \u201cevery tool\u201d available to block the voting restrictions, including taking the fight to the state\u2019s corporate interests. \u201cAs a business community, you can\u2019t talk about racial justice and then stand by and let voting rights be pushed back,\u201d Young told CNN in an interview Monday. Lauren Groh-Wargo \u2013 the CEO of Fair Fight Action, the voting rights group founded by former Democratic gubernatorial nominee Stacey Abrams \u2013 promised to \u201cfight in Georgia, in the courts and in Congress to make sure that Georgians\u2019 voting rights are not infringed.\u201d In one sign of the controversy over the measures, Duncan, who normally presides over the Senate, left the chamber Monday during the debate to signal his opposition to ending no-excuse absentee voting, his spokeswoman Macy McFall said. \u201cThe Lt. Governor has been crystal clear that he does not support the roll-back of absentee voting, and instead believes that modernizing and updating the system is more appropriate,\u201d McFall said in a statement to CNN. The state\u2019s Republican Gov. Brian Kemp has not declared whether he would sign the bill in its current form into law, but his spokeswoman Mallory Blount told CNN via email that Kemp \u201chas been clear about his support for strengthened voter ID provisions on absentee voting.\u201d The sweeping measure would establish new ID rules, requiring Georgians to submit an approved form of identification when both when requesting absentee ballots and when they return the ballots.   More broadly, Kemp wants to \u201censure Georgia\u2019s elections are secure, accessible, and fair \u2013 and that it must be easy to vote and hard to cheat in Georgia,\u201d Blount added, echoing Kemp\u2019s standard line about voting. Leading up to Monday\u2019s vote, Georgia Republicans faced pressure from grassroots GOP activists to pass voting restrictions. Former President Donald Trump has made repeated and baseless claims that election fraud contributed to his defeat in Georgia and elsewhere. And Trump has lashed out against Kemp, who is up for reelection in 2022, and other Republicans in the state who refused to back his fraud claims. 'Dripping in the blood of Jim Crow': Voting rights groups say GOP-backed bills in Georgia target Black voters The former President lost the state by nearly 12,000 votes last November, and there\u2019s no evidence of widespread fraud that would have overturned the election\u2019s outcome in Georgia or anywhere else, federal and state officials have said. Debbie Dooley, a Trump supporter and Tea Party activist in the Atlanta area, worked to rally support for the bill ahead of the vote. \u201cRepublicans either stand for election security and integrity or they stand with Democrats,\u201d she said in a phone interview with CNN Monday, shortly before the Senate vote. \u201cThe Republican base is united in this, and I dare Brian Kemp to veto a strong election security bill that comes to his desk,\u201d she said. \u201cHe\u2019s in enough trouble as it is. I know a lot of Republicans that have pledged not to support him under any circumstance.\u201d Much of the debate in Georgia focused on the ways the Senate bill would limit voting by mail. The bill aims to dismantle a 2005 Republican-backed law allowing no-excuse absentee voting. Georgia is one of 34 states that do not currently require an excuse to vote by mail, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. Biden signs executive order expanding voting access Under the measure approved Monday, to qualify for an absentee ballot, voters must be 65 years old or older, absent from their precinct, observing a religious holiday, required to provide constant care for someone with a physical disability, or required to work \u201cfor the protection of the health, life, or safety of the public during the entire time the polls are open,\u201d or be an overseas or military voter. A new analysis by the liberal-leaning Brennan Center for Justice at New York University concludes that allowing people who are 65 or older to cast their absentee ballots easily \u2013 while making it harder for younger voters to do so \u2013 would likely benefit White Georgians, who have made up a bigger share of older vote-by-mail participants. \u201cIt\u2019s an example of how a \u2018race neutral policy\u2019 can end up having racially disparate impacts,\u201d said Kevin Morris, a Brennan Center researcher. \u201cYou don\u2019t have to use the word \u2018race\u2019 to carve up the electorate in racially disparate ways.\u201d The Georgia legislative session ends March 31.",

            "article_content": "Black Georgians disproportionately cast their ballots on the weekend days that Republican lawmakers want to eliminate as options in future elections, according to a CNN analysis of voting data from last November\u2019s general election. A measure moving swiftly through the Georgia legislature would reduce the number of weekend days available for in-person early voting and ban casting ballots on the final Sunday of the early voting period. Voting rights activists say the move attacks the \u201cSouls to the Polls\u201d programs that help drive turnout among Black churchgoers, a key Democratic constituency.   Only 26.9% of the voters who cast in-person early ballots in Georgia during the general election were Black, state voting records showed. But CNN\u2019s analysis shows Black voters made up 34.6% of the voters who cast early ballots on the three weekend voting days that could be eliminated under the proposal from Georgia lawmakers \u2013 about 48,000 people, significantly more than President Joe Biden\u2019s victory over former President Donald Trump in the state. Biden won Georgia by just shy of 12,000 votes. Georgia sits at the epicenter of a nationwide battle over voting rights \u2013 following repeated and baseless claims by Trump that he lost the White House last fall because of fraud. Around the country, Republican-controlled state legislatures now are relying on election falsehoods to mount aggressive changes to voting rules. As of February 19, lawmakers in more than 40 states had introduced more than 250 bills that included voting restrictions, according to the liberal-leaning Brennan Center of Justice at New York University, which is tracking the bills. Georgia stands out for expansive Republican efforts to erect new barriers to voting, after the GOP lost the presidential election and two Senate contests. The Democratic victories in the state helped send Biden to the White House and gave Democrats a narrow majority in the US Senate. A sweeping package of new election rules that recently passed the Georgia House would \u2013 in addition to reducing the number of weekend days for early voting \u2013 restrict absentee voting, end automatic voter registration and limit access to drop boxes that voters use to return their absentee ballots. The bill has moved to the Georgia Senate, which is weighing its own list of new restrictions \u2013 including ending no-excuse absentee voting. Cliff Albright of the Georgia-based Black Voters Matter Fund called his state \u201cthe voter suppression capital of the country.\u201d \u201cThe breadth of this attack and the speed with which it\u2019s coming is unlike anything we\u2019ve seen since Jim Crow,\u201d Albright told CNN this week. Georgia Rep. Barry Fleming, the primary author of the package that passed the Georgia House, declined to comment for this story. But Fleming, who chairs a special House committee on elections, has said the provisions would address voter perceptions that they couldn\u2019t trust Georgia\u2019s election results. \u201cThe challenge for the legislature is to see what kind of changes we can make in our election system to try to increase that public confidence,\u201d Fleming said during a recent online discussion organized by the Georgia First Amendment Foundation. \u201cBecause if one thing we probably know, going forward in Georgia, we\u2019re going to have close elections.\u201d In the voting package passed this week, Republican lawmakers in the Georgia House retreated from an initial plan to ban Sunday voting entirely, amid public outcry. But the measure still cuts down on weekend voting. Under current law, local registrars in Georgia are allowed to offer in-person early voting on any of the four weekend days during the state\u2019s nearly three-week early voting period. The bill that passed the Georgia House this week would restrict that, only allowing early voting on two weekend days: either the first Saturday or Sunday of the early voting period \u2013 a decision left up to the registrar \u2013 as well as the second Saturday. In the leadup to the 2020 general election, roughly 138,000 voters cast in-person early ballots on the three days of early voting that could have possibly been eliminated had the new bill been in effect \u2013 the first Saturday and Sunday of the early voting period, October 17 and October 18, and the final Sunday of early voting, October 25. Those days saw disproportionately high rates of Black and minority turnout as compared to other early voting days, according to absentee voting records published by the Secretary of State\u2019s office. More broadly, White Georgians were less likely to vote on weekends than those from other racial and ethnic backgrounds. Only 8.6% of White voters who cast early in-person ballots did so on a weekend, compared with nearly 12% of Black and Latino voters and almost 15% of Asian voters. The CNN analysis used a copy of the Georgia voter file that includes voters\u2019 race, which was provided by Michael McDonald, a University of Florida professor who studies elections. Georgians self-report their race and ethnicity when they register to vote. Racial and ethnic data were not available for about 7% of voters who cast early in-person ballots in the 2020 general election. Shawanda Williams, a hospital administrator who lives in the Atlanta suburb of Conyers, cast her ballot on the last Sunday of the early voting period \u2013 a day that the House bill would exclude from early voting in future elections. In an interview with CNN, Williams said she appreciated the opportunity to cast her vote that day because she usually got home from work after her local early voting site had closed. On the last Sunday of early voting, she said, \u201cFootball was on, I figured nobody\u2019s going to be there \u2013 and I was able to run in and out.\u201d Without the opportunity to vote that day, Williams, who supported Biden, said she would have made time to cast her ballot \u2013 but it would have been a much bigger hassle. \u201cIt does seem like they\u2019re trying to change the rules to make it harder for people to vote,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s like voter suppression.\u201d Having multiple weekend voting options is particularly important for working-class Georgians, said Atlanta City Councilman Antonio Brown, who founded a social-justice group, The People\u2019s Uprising. \u201cMost working families are working two or three jobs, and don\u2019t have the capacity to be able to vote, like a normal person working a normal job where the hours of that job kind of coincide with their ability to go into a voting precinct and actually cast the ballot,\u201d Brown said. And across Georgia, Black churchgoers have a tradition of heading to the polls together after Sunday services \u2013 driving to the polls or riding in church vans to cast their ballots during the early voting period. Bishop Victor Powell is active in voting rights as pastor of the Rhema Word Cathedral in Albany, Georgia \u2013 in the heart of the state\u2019s rural \u201cBlack Belt.\u201d He said the \u201cSouls to the Polls\u201d push on the final Sunday of early voting offers convenience. \u201cYou\u2019ve got a ready-made audience that you can talk to and say, \u2018Before you go to dinner, go to the polls.\u2019 \u201c But Powell said he\u2019s always encouraged his congregation and the broader community to use every available path to the franchise. \u201cWe don\u2019t wait until the last day\u201d to vote, he said. \u201cAnything can happen.\u201d Georgia\u2019s push to restrict paths to voting comes as Republicans around the country \u2013 led by Trump \u2013 continue to promote the falsehood of election fraud. Speaking to activists over the weekend at the Conservative Political Action Conference, Trump repeatedly made false claims about the election and called for more restrictions, including proof of citizenship to cast a ballot and limits on mail-in voting. This week, former Vice President Mike Pence joined the criticism, taking aim at a Democratic bill that passed in the US House of Representatives on Wednesday that would set uniform standards for voting. The bill, dubbed The For the People Act, would deliver the biggest overhaul to US election law in decades. Among other provisions, it would mandate automatic voter registration, expand mail-in voting and restore voting rights to former felons. In an op-ed in The Daily Signal, Pence claimed the 2020 election was \u201cmarked by significant voting irregularities\u201d and described the work under way in state legislatures as needed \u201creform to restore public confidence in state elections.\u201d There is no evidence of widespread voter fraud that would have changed the outcome of the 2020 election. Allegations of voter fraud are \u201cjust code for historic Black turnout,\u201d said Sherrell Byrd, who helps run SOWEGA Rising, a community organization in southwest Georgia. \u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019s being attacked right now,\u201d she said. \u201cThe things we fought for. That our grandparents were fighting for. They said, \u2018Fine, we\u2019ll give you those rights.\u2019 We exercised those rights. We did what we were supposed to do, and it worked.\u201d \u201cSo, they continue to try to change the game,\u201d Byrd said of Georgia lawmakers. Black voters in Georgia helped propel Democrats to big wins. Exit polls show 88% of the Black electorate supported Biden last November. And in January, Democratic Sens. Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock saw even bigger support, capturing 92% and 93% of the Black vote in their runoff elections, respectively. Warnock, who won a special election, is on the ballot again in November 2022. Faced with the barrage of bills moving through the Georgia legislature, activists are turning to other forms of public pressure. This week, Black Voters Matters Fund launched an advertising effort with other voting-rights groups that calls on corporations in Georgia to speak out against the voting restrictions. And this weekend, the NBA is teaming with a group founded by Los Angeles Lakers superstar LeBron James to promote voting rights during Sunday\u2019s All-Star Game in Atlanta. Powell, the pastor from Albany, said he\u2019s hopeful that Black voters in the state and elsewhere won\u2019t retreat, even if Georgia\u2019s proposed voting restrictions become law. \u201cAn awakening has taken place, not only in places like Georgia, but in Pennsylvania and Wisconsin,\u201d Powell said, ticking off battleground states that saw strong Black voter turnout last year. \u201cPeople will find a way because they witnessed what happens when we get engaged and come together.\u201d",

During oral arguments Tuesday in an Arizona voting rights case with national implications, Roberts sounded ready to hew to that latter path. The court\u2019s ruling could diminish the ability of Native American, Latino and Black voters to claim discrimination under the 1965 law. In 2013, Roberts led a narrow high court majority to eliminate separate Voting Rights Act coverage related to states with a history of bias. They no longer are required to obtain federal approval for new voting districts, poll closings or other electoral change \u2013 which prompted some states to enact new voter ID requirements and polling changes. Supreme Court conservatives poised to uphold Arizona's curbs on voting Tuesday\u2019s case, tied to a section of the law covering claims of intentional discrimination once a regulation is in place, could have greater repercussions arising as several states consider new voter restrictions, some based on lingering and unproven allegations of fraud from the 2020 election. Lawyers for the Democratic National Committee and Arizona Secretary of State told the justices wide swaths of Native Americans and other minorities could be disenfranchised by Arizona laws requiring ballots cast by people at the wrong precinct to be tossed and prohibiting most third parties \u2013 beyond a relative or mail carrier \u2013 from collecting absentee ballots, for example, at a nursing home. Roberts focused on potential voter irregularities, highlighting a finding from a 2005 bipartisan commission on absentee ballot fraud. Countering arguments that rural Native Americans and Latinos rely disproportionately on third parties to collect their ballots, Roberts questioned whether that should force states \u201cto tolerate\u201d possible fraud. The justices to Roberts\u2019 right appeared even readier to back the Arizona regulations. In the past as the justices wrestled with difficult social dilemmas, Roberts has inched to the center, sometimes with other conservatives, for a moderate ruling in these polarized times. Based on the tenor of oral arguments, the court majority appeared headed to the hard right. The new 6-3, conservative-liberal bench seemed to have sufficient votes to reverse a US appellate court and uphold the Arizona restrictions. The crucial additional question that would affect future litigation nationwide is what standard the majority adopts to resolve claims of voter discrimination based on race. A decision siding with Arizona Republicans and a tough standard for assessing the denial of voting rights would deepen the pattern of the 66-year-old Roberts, who has demonstrated he believes government remedies tied to race, whether in voter protections, public school integration plans or university affirmative action, violate the constitutional guarantee of equality and, in the end, disserve racial minorities. As a young lawyer in the Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush administrations, Roberts wrote that voting-rights law interfered with state authority. It was a theme he carried to the bench. Soon after joining the Supreme Court in 2005, Roberts wrote in a 2006 voting rights case, \u201cIt is a sordid business, this divvying us up by race.\u201d The following year, as he rejected school integration plans, he said, \u201cThe way to stop discrimination on the basis of race is to stop discriminating on the basis of race.\u201d Affirmative action opponents ask Supreme Court to hear case over Harvard's policy The Arizona controversy picked up from Roberts\u2019 consequential 2013 opinion that now prevents federal officials from pre-screening potentially discriminatory voting rules in states with histories of racial bias. Roberts said the problems that section of the Voting Rights Act was designed to correct no longer existed. His decision in Shelby County v. Holder preserved the separate VRA section related to direct government discrimination and now at issue as the justices consider various standards for determining legislative intentions and when a person\u2019s right to vote is unconstitutionally impinged. Why millennials and Gen Z have the most to lose in the voting wars Referring to Roberts\u2019 opinion in the case, Bruce Spiva, representing the Democratic National Committee, said Tuesday, \u201cThe Court acknowledged that voting discrimination still exists. \u2026 This is proven not just an accurate description of the times in 2013, but also prophetic. \u2026 The last three months have seen an even greater uptick in proposed voting restrictions, many aimed squarely at the minority groups whose participation Congress intended to protect.\u201d But during an earlier exchange, the chief justice questioned how judges could assess legislators\u2019 potentially discriminatory motives, particularly if only two of 100 lawmakers, for example, voice \u201cclear racial motivation.\u201d Spiva said the record in Arizona was not so scant: \u201cWhat we have here in this record \u2026 is far from that.\u201d \u201cI thought the evidence of racial intent was really quite limited in this case,\u201d Roberts countered. \u201cIt\u2019s actually well beyond what you normally have,\u201d Spiva said, as Roberts continued to express doubts. Justice Clarence Thomas reveals some sympathy for Trump's baseless fraud claims The Arizona Republican Party and Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich have appealed to the justices a California-based US appellate court decision rejecting both Arizona measures. The appeals court pointed up the state\u2019s long history of bias against Native American, Hispanic and Black voters and found the new regulations disproportionately fell on minorities. In their arguments, Brnovich and Michael Carvin, who separately represented the Arizona Republican Party, emphasized state power to set election procedures and said the challengers failed to show voting rights were sufficiently burdened to prove a VRA claim. Brnovich said challengers must show a \u201csubstantial impact\u201d on minorities\u2019 ability to participate and elect the candidate of their choice. Roberts questioned how to define \u201csubstantial.\u201d Brnovich said judges should consider \u201cthe totality of the circumstances,\u201d including whether there are several ways to cast a vote, in person and by mail. Overall, Brnovich said the Arizona restrictions are \u201ccommon-sense and commonplace\u201d measures to prevent voter fraud and coercion. The Democratic challengers, however, contended Arizona frequently changes polling locations in minority areas and that minority voters were twice as likely to have their votes rejected for being out-of-precinct than white voters. Separately, Arizona\u2019s Native American and Latino communities were found to have limited access to mail delivery and often relied on third parties to deliver their ballots. Democrats in Congress begin sweeping effort to overhaul election laws Roberts, questioning lawyer Jessica Amunson, referred to the 2005 commission on Federal Election Reform led by former President Jimmy Carter and former Secretary of State James Baker that warned that people who vote with mail ballots at nursing homes, work and church were more susceptible to pressure or intimidation. \u201cThey said that absentee ballots are the largest sort of potential voter fraud,\u201d he said. Amunson said some states may have an interest in limiting ballot collection \u201cbut when you look at the particular facts here, that does not appear to be Arizona\u2019s interest.\u201d She said the record in the case showed that Native Americans and Latinos relied more on ballot collection than white voters. Roberts dismissed that as \u201cracial proportionality\u201d and said, \u201cI\u2019m just asking you if that requires you to tolerate the difficulties in problems and pressures that President Carter and Secretary Baker outlined in that report.\u201d Amunson said Arizona officials were not trying to secure ballots and prevent fraud. \u201cWhat Arizona was acting to do,\u201d she said, \u201cwas to limit the participation of Hispanics and Native Americans in particular.\u201d",

            "article_content": "The Supreme Court is poised on Tuesday to hear a case that supporters of voting rights fear will lead the court\u2019s new conservative majority to weaken a key provision of the Voting Rights Act that prohibits laws that result in racial discrimination. The dispute comes in the aftermath of a contentious election which prompted former President Donald Trump to make unfounded claims of voter fraud and inspired his supporters to storm the US Capitol in an attempt to overturn the election. Republican state legislators across the country are also moving at a fast clip to pass laws to restrict voting access. According to the Brennan Center for Justice, as of February 19, state lawmakers have carried over or introduced 253 bills with provisions that restrict voting access in 43 states. Republican legislators around the country seek to strip governors and officials of emergency election powers Eight years ago, Chief Justice John Roberts wrote the 5-4 majority opinion in Shelby County v. Holder, effectively gutting Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act, a provision that required states with a history of discrimination to obtain the permission of the federal government or the courts before enacting new laws related to voting. RELATED: Ruth Bader Ginsburg\u2019s most notable Supreme Court decisions and dissents Since that decision, challengers to voting restrictions have increasingly turned to Section 2 of the law, that holds that no voting regulation can be imposed that \u201cresults in a denial or abridgement of the right of any citizen of the United States to vote on account of race or color.\u201d (Unlike a challenge brought under Section 5, a Section 2 challenge occurs after the voting rule is in place.) Now the court, with its strong 6-3 conservative-liberal majority, will consider the standards courts will use to determine if a rule violates Section 2. Member of Biden legal team reacts to Trump's election lies Brnovich v. DNC concerns a challenge brought by the Democratic National Committee against two provisions of an Arizona law. The first is a requirement that in-person Election Day voters cast their votes in their assigned precinct. Another concerns the so called \u201cballot-collection law\u201d that permits only certain persons \u2013 family, caregivers, mail carriers and elections officials \u2013 to handle another person\u2019s completed ballot. While several states have versions of both laws, they function differently from state to state. Arizona, for instance, has one of the most strict \u201cout of precinct\u201d regulations and it has a significant Native American population living on rural reservations without traditional mailing addresses and limited access to mail. \u201cFor that reason, they are more likely to rely on ballot collection to turn in their mail in ballots,\u201d said Sean Morales-Doyle of the Brennan Center for Justice. Arizona Republicans propose giving lawmakers -- not election officials -- final review of election results A federal appeals court invalidated the provisions, stressing the state\u2019s \u201clong history of race-based discrimination against its American Indian, Hispanic, and African American citizens\u201d and highlighting a \u201cpattern of discrimination against minority voters has continued to the present day.\u201d Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich, a Republican, and the Arizona Republican Party, appealed the case to the Supreme Court, defending the laws as \u201ccommonplace election administration provisions\u201d used by Arizona and \u201cdozens of states.\u201d The provisions \u201chelp to ensure the smooth operation of elections and to safeguard the integrity of the process,\u201d said Jason Snead of the Honest Elections Project, a group that filed a brief in support of Arizona. Trump\u2019s acting solicitor general, Jeff Wall, backed Arizona in December, arguing that the state allows eligible voters to cast ballots in \u201ca variety of ways.\u201d Wall said that to violate Section 2 a plaintiff has to show that members of one racial group are \u201cless able\u201d than others to vote. Arizona GOP censures Flake, Ducey and McCain, signaling a fractured party in a key swing state \u201cA rule that leaves all voters readily able to vote and simply eliminates a method some prefer does not abridge anyone\u2019s ability to vote and keeps the voting process equally open,\u201d Wall wrote. Marc Elias, a lawyer for the DNC who handled dozens of cases fighting efforts to block the counting of votes and switching Electoral College votes in the aftermath of the 2020 presidential election, responded that Supreme Court precedents and the law \u201ccompelled the lower court to conclude that Arizona\u2019s wholesale rejection of ballots cast out-of-precinct and its criminalization of ballot collection violated Voting Rights Act.\u201d When the legislature considered the laws, the record was \u201cdevoid of any evidence that fraud had in fact occurred,\u201d Elias said. Why millennials and Gen Z have the most to lose in the voting wars President Joe Biden\u2019s Justice Department has also weighed in with a letter to the court, departing from the position taken by the DNC and agreeing with the Trump administration that the Arizona laws didn\u2019t violate Section 2. However, the Biden DOJ made clear it didn\u2019t agree with the reasoning behind the Trump administration\u2019s brief. That could be key. It would mean that the DNC could lose the case at hand, but prevail in a cascade of similar cases that could reach the court in the coming years. \u201cUnder the Trump administration, the DOJ\u2019s brief suggested a sizable change to existing law that would do real damage to the Voting Rights Act,\u201d Justin Levitt, a voting law expert at Loyola Law School, said in an interview. He said that the fact that the Biden and the DNC don\u2019t fully agree should be seen as a good sign. \u201cThat shows a welcome return to normal standards at DOJ, where high-profile cases once again follow the best view of the law \u2013 even when it means that the President\u2019s party loses an election case,\u201d Levitt said. Amy Coney Barrett grilled on voting rights as 2020 election is underway RELATED: Republican legislators around the country seek to strip governors and officials of emergency election powers The court is hearing Brnovich v. DNC concurrently with a related case, Arizona Republican Party v. DNC. Oral arguments will be held by telephone, as the court has for nearly a year now due to the coronavirus pandemic. That means not all of the justices will see the stark fencing surrounding the US Capitol, site of the Trump-inspired riot in January. \u201cI think an insurrection that looks like it was led by White nationalists and other extreme groups, that was aimed at stopping the election, should serve as a stark reminder both as to why we still need protections and why we still need to be worried about the role that race plays in our democracy,\u201d Morales-Doyle said.",

            "article_content": "In an epic struggle over voting rights, the future political influence of the diverse generations now aging into the electorate could pivot on the fate of legislation the House is expected to consider this week. Even as Republican-controlled states, drawing on former President Donald Trump\u2019s groundless claims of massive fraud in 2020, are advancing a wave of proposals making it tougher to vote, House Democrats this week will consider HR 1, sweeping legislation that would establish a nationwide baseline of voting rights. Although many of the provisions in HR 1 would ease the way for more young people to participate in politics, particularly important may be its measures requiring every state to create systems for automatic, same-day and online voter registration. That could significantly reduce what many experts consider the biggest barrier to more young people voting in American elections: a complex and varying registration system that far fewer younger than older voters have been able, or willing, to navigate. That barrier is often especially daunting for younger voters of color, who represent a growing share of the nation\u2019s emerging electorate. In fact, in many of the states where Republicans are moving most aggressively to erect new obstacles to voting \u2013 including Georgia, Arizona, Texas and likely Florida \u2013 young people of color composed a clear majority of everyone who has turned 18 since the 2016 election, according to census figures. The goal of a democracy should be that the people who are participating in it look a lot like the people who live in it. Right now, the electorate is older, Whiter and wealthier than the population writ large. Ben Wessel, executive director, NextGen America If that barrier is entrenched, it could suppress for years the political emergence of these younger generations. Conversely, advocates argue, the nationwide standards of voting and registration rights established in HR 1 could greatly accelerate the pace at which millennials, Generation Z and eventually their younger siblings \u2013 the most racially and religiously diverse generations in American history \u2013 achieve political clout commensurate with their growing numbers. The nationwide floor of voting rights in HR 1 would \u201cmake the electorate look more like the population,\u201d says Ben Wessel, executive director of NextGen America, a group that mobilizes young voters for progressive causes. \u201cThe goal of a democracy should be that the people who are participating in it look a lot like the people who live in it. Right now, the electorate is older, Whiter and wealthier than the population writ large. And this rights that wrong.\u201d Thousands of young progressives say they want to run for office While HR 1 is certain to pass the House \u2013 every House Democrat has endorsed it \u2013 it is also virtually certain to die beneath a Republican filibuster in the Senate unless Democrats vote to eliminate or retrench that legislative tactic. (At this point, two Democratic senators, Joe Manchin of West Virginia and Kyrsten Sinema of Arizona, are opposed to ending or curtailing the filibuster.) That decision could shape not only the balance of power between the parties through the coming decade, but between the generations as well. \u201cThat rising American electorate, however you want to characterize it, their voice is very dependent on being able to access these baseline standards when it comes to registering and voting across the country,\u201d Democratic Rep. John Sarbanes of Maryland, the chief sponsor of HR 1, told me. Though multiple studies and investigations have found that voter fraud is extremely rare, Republicans for more than a decade have sought to impose tougher restrictions on voting across a wide range of states. Their political assumption has been that Republicans benefit when turnout is lower, because their base of middle-aged and older Whites are often the most reliable voters. Ironically, Trump\u2019s success in turning out huge numbers of previously nonvoting Whites (especially those without college degrees) has demolished the theory that higher turnout always benefits Democrats. But that hasn\u2019t stopped the GOP offensive against voting access; instead, with Trump conditioning most Republicans to vote solely on Election Day itself, state Republicans are targeting the voting tools that encourage participation by Democratic-leaning constituencies of young people and minorities \u2013 among them mail ballots and early voting days. Trump, in his speech Sunday at the Conservative Political Action Conference, signaled his support for nationwide rules that would severely restrict the former and ban the latter. Conservative Supreme Court majority gets another crack at the Voting Rights Act The immediate context for the surge of proposals in Republican-controlled states that would make it more difficult to vote or register is Trump\u2019s unfounded claims of massive fraud in the 2020 election, which polls consistently show about three-fourths of Republican voters say they believe, despite the rejection of his supposed \u201cevidence\u201d by courts across the country. But the larger context is that this ferocious struggle over access to the ballot \u2013 what some analysts consider the broadest assault on voting rights since the Jim Crow era in the segregated South \u2013 is occurring at a moment of profound generational and racial transition. Particularly in rapidly changing states across the Sun Belt, the voter suppression measures Republicans are advancing amount to stacking sandbags against a rising demographic tide. The baby boom generation \u2013 which is predominantly White because America admitted very few immigrants from 1924 through 1965 \u2013 is ending a nearly four-decade run as the dominant generation in the US electorate. Baby boomers have made up the largest generation of eligible voters since 1980, according to calculations by the nonpartisan States of Change project, which studies voting trends and demographic change. But in 2024, the group projects, the diverse younger generations of Americans born in 1981 or after \u2013 millennials and Generation Z \u2013 for the first time will represent a much larger share of eligible voters (nearly 45%) than the baby boomers and \u201csilent generation,\u201d born before 1964 (who will compose about 35% of voters). By 2028, millennials and Generation Z will make up almost exactly half of eligible voters, and those born before 1964 will fall below 3 in 10. Young leaders ask Biden administration for a seat at the table The forward edge of this transition is already reshaping the electorate, particularly in many of the Sun Belt states where Republicans now control state government with a coalition that revolves around older, non-college and non-urban Whites. From 2016 through 2020, a clear majority of the young people who turned 18 \u2013 and thus became eligible to vote \u2013 were people of color in Florida, Georgia, North Carolina, Arizona and Texas, according to calculations provided to me by demographer William Frey of the Brookings Institution\u2019s Metropolitan Policy Program. All of these numbers point toward a potential shift of political influence. But the impact of these burgeoning generations is diluted because they don\u2019t turn out to vote at near the rate of the oldest voters: The States of Change project, for instance, forecasts that even though young people born after 1981 will exceed older Americans born before 1964 among eligible voters in 2024, the older group, because of much higher turnout, will still equal them as a share of actual voters. Wessel, whose group focuses on turning out younger voters, says the complex voter registration rules, which vary from state to state, are a key reason for that disparity. Census figures from 2020 aren\u2019t yet available, but in 2018, only about half of eligible young adults aged 18-24 were registered to vote, compared with three-fourths of seniors and around 7 in 10 of those aged 45-64. \u201cHaving to register to vote is one of the biggest barriers to getting young people to participate in our elections,\u201d Wessel says. \u201cRegistration is an intentionally complicated process in many states \u2026 for young people who are itinerant, who aren\u2019t used to filling out government forms like this \u2026 who are intimidated by not wanting to screw something up in general \u2013 all of which defines people who are just entering adulthood.\u201d Democratic Sen. Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, who\u2019s been a leading proponent of registration revisions, agrees. \u201cSo many times, when you have students and young people and they are new at this \u2026 you just have to make it easier,\u201d she told me. For Klobuchar and other Democrats, the answer is the three big registration mandates in HR 1 and its Senate equivalent, S 1. The bills would require every state to adopt \u201cautomatic voter registration,\u201d in which eligible adults are automatically registered to vote whenever they come in contact with government agencies, usually the department of motor vehicles. It would also require every state to permit \u201csame day registration,\u201d in which voters can register when they show up to cast their ballots, either during an early voting period (which is also mandated by the bill) or on Election Day. Finally, it would also require every state to allow voters to register online. All but 11 states already permit online registration (though the holdouts include the key states of Texas and North Carolina). But only about 20 states now offer either automatic or same-day voter registration. Most of the states that make these options available \u2013 particularly the automatic voter registration \u2013 lean toward the Democrats. One exception to this pattern has been Georgia, a changing but historically red state, which provides for automatic registration (though not same-day registration). Last October, the state\u2019s Republican secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger, issued a news release celebrating the milestone that the state had reached an all-time high of nearly 7.6 million adults registered to vote; automatic registration through the state\u2019s Department of Driver Services accounted for more than 5 million of those voters, his office reported. Data provided to me by Catalist, a Democratic targeting firm, show that the number of registered voters has grown substantially for all racial groups in Georgia since the state adopted automatic voter registration in 2016. But under the automatic system, new registrations have grown much faster for Blacks, Asian Americans and Hispanics than for Whites: From 2016 to 2020, the state added roughly twice as many new Black voters and almost 10 times as many new Hispanic voters as it had from 2010 through 2016, the Catalist figures show. Automatic registration does not account for all of that change \u2013 state Democrats led by 2018 gubernatorial candidate Stacey Abrams have mounted a sustained effort to register and mobilize voters in recent years \u2013 but it has eased the process. Even Raffensperger noted in his release last fall: \u201cThe continued growth of Georgia\u2019s registered voting population is a testament to the simple and easy registration options the Secretary of State\u2019s office provides to Georgia voters, including automated registration through DDS.\u201d What we saw this past election was confusion and chaos caused by inconsistent standards and last-minute changes to established election laws by state officials and activist judges. It\u2019s now more clear than ever that there is a serious need for major reforms to our election systems. US Sen. Rick Scott, a Florida Republican These racial trends may help explain why a committee in the Republican-controlled Georgia Senate voted last Friday to end the state\u2019s automatic voter registration system. (The same committee voted to revoke the state\u2019s law allowing any voter to cast an absentee ballot on request. On Monday, the Republican-controlled Georgia House of Representatives approved a separate slate of voting restrictions, including new voter ID requirements for mail ballots and cutbacks in the Sunday early voting \u201csouls to the polls\u201d option popular with African American churches.) Republican Sen. Rick Scott of Florida, along with several GOP colleagues, recently proposed legislation that would ban any state from using automatic voter registration for federal elections. \u201cWhat we saw this past election was confusion and chaos caused by inconsistent standards and last-minute changes to established election laws by state officials and activist judges,\u201d Scott insisted in a statement. \u201cIt\u2019s now more clear than ever that there is a serious need for major reforms to our election systems.\u201d Yet the states that have implemented automatic and same-day voter registration have mostly seen positive results. In a 2019 study, the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University Law School concluded that states with automatic registration saw consistent boosts in the share of eligible voters who registered; another study, by the University of Southern California and California Civic Engagement Project, found more uneven impacts, with little change in some places, but clear positive impacts in other states. Political scientist Michael McDonald of the University of Florida, a leading student of voting patterns, told me in an email that \u201cnumerous studies have found about a 5-7 point voter turnout increase\u201d in states that use same-day registration. Colorado is one of the few states that already offer automatic, same-day and online registration, the trifecta of revisions that HR 1 would mandate. Secretary of State Jena Griswold told me that 90% of eligible voters were registered for the 2020 election, an extraordinary number. (Roughly three-fourths of eligible Colorado voters cast ballots last fall, among the highest turnout rates in the country, according to McDonald\u2019s U.S. Elections Project.) Though 2020 figures aren\u2019t yet available, the Census Bureau found that in 2018, the share of young people aged 18-24 who were registered in Colorado greatly exceeded the national average. \u201cIt\u2019s 2021, and I think Americans expect things to be accessible,\u201d Griswold says. \u201cAutomatic voter registration, same-day voter registration and online voter registration are a modernization of our elections that Americans should expect. Being able to sign up to exercise your constitutional right to vote should be accessible, and that\u2019s what those three programs do.\u201d Like Griswold, Myrna Perez, director of the Brennan Center\u2019s voting rights and election program, says the registration policies in HR1 could work together synergistically. \u201cOne of the things to remember is just like one anti-voter policy is not going to stop everyone from voting, one pro-voter policy isn\u2019t going to be the magic bullet that gets everybody voting,\u201d she says. \u201cYou need different policies because different communities are different.\u201d Klobuchar, for instance, notes that of these policies, \u201cSame-day registration particularly helps young people who haven\u2019t voted before and don\u2019t have a registration that\u2019s always been in place for, say, 20 years before.\u201d If you happen to be a person of color voting in Alabama you should have the same access as in Colorado. Jena Griswold, Colorado secretary of state Estimates vary on how many new voters could be added to the rolls if the registration provisions in HR 1 become nationwide law. But evidence from the states that have adopted these rules is prompting some dramatic forecasts. Jacob Hacker, a Yale University political scientist known for his writing on political polarization, recently estimated that the HR 1 changes could lead to as many as 50 million more registered voters; the Brennan Center has also concluded gains of that magnitude are possible, though other factors would matter too, such as whether Americans remain as engaged in politics as they have been during the past few years, notes Perez. Looming over every aspect of this debate is the profound generational and racial transition in which the diverse cohorts of young people born since 1981 now constitute a majority of the American population \u2013 but still a distinct minority of voters. With a nationwide baseline of guaranteed registration and voting rights, those emerging generations could rapidly reshape the electorate over the next decade. But their influence could grow much more slowly, and unevenly, if they face barriers to participation across most of the red states \u2013 which include many of the Sun Belt states at the epicenter of the demographic change. For that reason, the split-level struggle over access to the vote \u2013 with Republicans in the states mostly seeking to limit it while Democrats in Washington try to expand it \u2013 returns to a core question that is becoming even more urgent as the nation inexorably grows more diverse: Will all Americans have equal opportunity to participate in the democracy? \u201cWe are talking about Americans\u2019 constitutional rights, and I believe that all Americans should have access to exercising those rights,\u201d says Griswold. \u201cIf you happen to be a person of color voting in Alabama you should have the same access as in Colorado. It\u2019s not about the state: It\u2019s about the voter.

            "article_content": "In a critical voting rights case, conservative Supreme Court justices on Tuesday suggested they were ready to uphold two provisions of an Arizona voting law that Democrats argue violate the historic Voting Rights Act. Supporters of voting rights are fearful that the court\u2019s new 6-3 solidified conservative majority will weaken a key provision of the act that prohibits laws that result in racial discrimination. For over two hours of telephonic arguments, the justices grappled not only with the Arizona law at hand but with a standard that courts should apply when considering such laws going forward. Lawyers challenging the provisions came under consistent attack in various forms from all of the conservatives on the court who seemed skeptical of the tests put forward by a lawyer representing the Democratic National Committee. Why millennials and Gen Z have the most to lose in the voting wars Justice Samuel Alito told the DNC lawyer that his position in the case \u201cis going to make every voting rule vulnerable to attack\u201d under the law. \u201cPeople who are poor and less well educated on balance probably will find it more difficult to comply with just about every voting rule than do people who are more affluent and have had the benefit of more education,\u201d said Alito, a conservative appointed by President George W. Bush. He asked whether it would \u201cnot be possible to show with respect to just about every voting rule\u201d statistical disparities can emerge. What was less clear from arguments is what test the justices will settle on that could impact a raft of new voting restrictions introduced throughout the states. The Arizona law being challenged requires that in-person Election Day voters cast their votes in their assigned precinct. Another provision says that only certain persons \u2013 family, caregivers, mail carriers and elections officials \u2013 may deliver another person\u2019s completed ballot to the polling place. Chief Justice John Roberts noted at one point, that a bipartisan commission had determined that such laws may be necessary to combat voter fraud. Justice Brett Kavanaugh agreed on that point and asked a DNC lawyer whether there might be a \u201cstrong justification\u201d for the laws that are also common in other states. Bruce Spiva, a lawyer for the DNC, reminded the justices that \u201cvoting discrimination still exists, no one doubts this.\u201d \u201cMore voting restrictions have been enacted over the last decade than at any point since the end of Jim Crow,\u201d Spiva said, and added that \u201cthe last three months have seen an even greater uptick in proposed voting restrictions, many aimed squarely at the minority groups whose participation Congress intended to protect.\u201d While several states have versions of both laws, they function differently from state to state. Arizona, for instance, has one of the strictest \u201cout of precinct\u201d regulations and it has a significant Native American population living on rural reservations without traditional mailing addresses and limited access to mail. \u201cFor that reason, they are more likely to rely on ballot collection to turn in their mail in ballots,\u201d said Sean Morales-Doyle of the Brennan Center for Justice. Last year, a federal appeals court invalidated the Arizona provisions, stressing the state\u2019s \u201clong history of race-based discrimination against its American Indian, Hispanic, and African American citizens\u201d and highlighting a \u201cpattern of discrimination against minority voters has continued to the present day.\u201d Justice Clarence Thomas, an active participant in the telephonic arguments, asked a lawyer for the state \u201cwhat percentage\u201d of minorities who cast ballots in the state were affected by the policies. A lawyer for Arizona\u2019s secretary of state responded it was \u201cless than 1%.\u201d But when Justice Amy Coney Barrett pushed Michael Carvin, a lawyer representing the Arizona Republican Party, as to the GOP\u2019s interest in the two laws, Carvin didn\u2019t mention that it was necessary to combat voter fraud. Instead he talked about pure politics. \u201cIt puts us at a competitive disadvantage relative to Democrats,\u201d he said. \u201cPolitics is a zero sum game, and every extra vote they get through unlawful interpretations of Section 2 hurts us.\u201d Liberal justices, meanwhile, focused their attention on future challenges concerning laws that on their face don\u2019t seem problematic but result in racial discrimination. The dispute comes in the aftermath of a contentious election that prompted former President Donald Trump to make unfounded claims of voter fraud and inspired his supporters to storm the US Capitol in an attempt to overturn the election. Republican state legislators across the country are also moving at a fast clip to pass laws to restrict voting access. According to the Brennan Center for Justice, as of February 19, state lawmakers have carried over or introduced 253 bills with provisions that restrict voting access in 43 states. Eight years ago, Roberts wrote the 5-4 majority opinion in Shelby County v. Holder, effectively gutting Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act, a provision that required states with a history of discrimination to obtain the permission of the federal government or the courts before enacting new laws related to voting. Since that decision, challengers to voting restrictions have increasingly turned to Section 2 of the law, that holds that no voting regulation can be imposed that \u201cresults in a denial or abridgement of the right of any citizen of the United States to vote on account of race or color.\u201d (Unlike a challenge brought under Section 5, a Section 2 challenge occurs after the voting rule is in place.) Liberal justices on Tuesday focused their attention on future challenges concerning laws that on their face don\u2019t seem problematic but result in racial discrimination. Justice Elena Kagan used her time to posit several hypotheticals about laws that might seem legitimate on their fact but result in  racial discrimination. She mentioned an array of circumstances including ballot places that could be closed on Sunday, placing polling places at country clubs or poling hours limited to the hours of 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. At another point she seemed to be searching for a line the court could draw. \u201cThere are some things that are really quite obvious burdens, which you just know looking at them is going to lead to read difficulty for black voters or for Native American voters or for Latino voters,\u201d Kagan said. Justice Sonia Sotomayor was critical of a standard put forward by Carvin. \u201cAren\u2019t you rewriting Section 2?\u201d she asked. She also pointed out that a district court found \u201cno meaningful threat\u201d that a ballot collection law leads to fraud. In court, Arizona\u2019s Attorney General Mark Brnovich told the justices that the two provisions  \u201cdo not create any disparate impact on racial minorities but serve us all equally well.\u201d Justice Stephen Breyer pushed back on the notion that a law could  pass legal muster if all voters still had the same opportunities to vote. He referenced literacy tests used early in the nation\u2019s history to disenfranchise voters. \u201cOne question,\u201d he asked, \u201cis a literacy test, does that provide people with the same opportunity?\u201d This story has been updated with additional details from oral arguments.

            "article_content": "The January 6 riot on the US Capitol was a cataclysm \u2013 incited by a President willing to lie for political gain and a political party willing to accommodate him out of fear of political retribution. Nothing, apparently, has changed. Witness Rep. Steve Scalise (Louisiana) during an appearance on ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week\u201d hosted by Jon Karl: Karl: But \u2013 but, wait a minute, I mean, [Donald Trump] hasn\u2019t taken responsibility. You heard Kevin McCarthy say \u2013 I mean, do you agree with what Kevin McCarthy said there, that the President must take responsibility, that the facts demand that he take responsibility for what happened on January 6? Scalise: Well, first of all \u2013 now, I wrote a Wall Street Journal editorial about where I think the responsibility lays for January 6. And surely, there\u2019s a lot of blame to go around. But at the end of the day, the people who stormed the Capitol on January 6, it was a disgrace. And they need to be held accountable. And in fact, over 180 have already been arrested. And I know the FBI\u2019s working to root out every person who broke into the Capitol, who attacked police. There\u2019s no place for that. Um, \u201csurely there\u2019s a lot of blame to go around?\u201d Well, yes, there is. Trump, his enablers in Congress, conservative talk radio and TV, political professionals who seized on the stolen election lie to line their own pockets\u2026.. But I don\u2019t think that\u2019s what Scalise means. In fact, he appears to be engaged in a \u201cboth-siderism\u201d argument, the idea that bad people from all over the political spectrum were responsible for the damage done to the Capitol and the country on January 6. In fact, as the interview wore on, Scalise went further down the \u201cwhataboutism\u201d road. \u201cWhen you look at \u2013 look, Donald Trump has denounced what happened, and I think everybody should have been unequivocal in their denouncing of what happened, not only on January 6 but during the summer, when they were burning down cities, shooting cops, beating people in the streets,\u201d he told Karl. \u201cYou \u2013 you saw \u2026 the left denouncing January 6, as we did. They didn\u2019t denounce what happened during the summer.\u201d Worth noting here: While there was some violence at protests over racial in equity during the summer of 2020 it was a) not widespread and b) not an assault on the US Capitol while the vice president of the United States and members of Congress were inside it. Also worth noting: Trump never denounced the violence on January 6. Quite the opposite. \u201cWe love you. You\u2019re very special,\u201d Trump told rioters on that day. Asked by Karl whether Joe Biden was the \u201clegitimate\u201d president, Scalise said this: \u201cLook, Joe Biden\u2019s the president. There were a few states that did not follow their state laws. That\u2019s really the dispute that you\u2019ve seen continue on.\u201d Which isn\u2019t a simple \u201cyes.\u201d What Scalise\u2019s interview shows is that the internal politics of the House GOP conference \u2013 and the party\u2019s broader base \u2013 simply leave no room for anyone to cross Trump. Still. Regardless of whether Scalise believes what he says about the election and the January 6 riot, he feels compelled to say those things because he knows that if he doesn\u2019t toe the line, he can expect a leadership challenge, a censure from his state party and a likely primary challenge next year. That fear of reprisal means that the GOP is still Donald Trump\u2019s party, and will be until its elected leaders start putting principle over political calculation.",

            "article_content": "A cluster of election officials around the country have lost or left their jobs in recent weeks, as the fallout from the tumultuous 2020 election season continues. The exits come as experts say a wave of departures could be on the horizon, as elections officials reach retirement age or leave jobs that have become increasingly targeted in partisan political battles. Secretaries of state have broad portfolios, ranging from election oversight to registering corporations. The day-to-day responsibilities of administering elections generally fall to officials at the county and city level. Indiana\u2019s Secretary of State Connie Lawson, the state\u2019s longest-serving elections chief, announced Monday her plans to resign, saying \u201c2020 took a toll on me.\u201d On Tuesday, the Fulton County, Georgia, elections board voted 3-2 to remove elections director Richard Barron from his post in the state\u2019s largest county, citing the need to modernize elections. (His future is in flux after a county commission failed to ratify the election panel\u2019s decision.) And Pennsylvania\u2019s top election official Kathy Boockvar, who became a familiar face across the country as she oversaw an intensely scrutinized presidential contest last November, resigned this month after her agency mistakenly failed to advertise a proposed constitutional amendment \u2013 an error unrelated to the 2020 election. Potentially a quarter of local election officials in some of the country\u2019s largest jurisdictions are planning to retire before 2024, according to a survey of 857 officials in all 50 states by the Early Voting Information Center at Reed College. Overall, the survey showed a majority of election officials \u2013 about 90% \u2013 shared that the work they do is personally satisfying, but that the stresses of balancing the work and resource requirements are hard. Of those officials surveyed, less than 50% felt the workload of their job was reasonable and were able to leave their problems at work. Reed College political scientist Paul Manson said the election officials surveyed cited two reasons most often for their departures: They had \u201cserved their time\u201d and \u201cthe political environment.\u201d \u201cThat is part of what we think is going on here: that the focus on what was sort of more classically a clerical role is now becoming a more political role,\u201d he said. At the county level in the battleground state of Pennsylvania, some 25 senior election officials have left their jobs in the last year, state officials told legislators at a recent hearing. That\u2019s left critical openings at roughly a third of the commonwealth\u2019s 67 counties. Across the country, election officials faced challenges like no other in 2020 as they helped a record numbers of Americans \u2013 nearly 160 million people \u2013 cast ballots in the middle of the pandemic. Lawson, whose term expires in early 2023, said she was stepping down to focus on her health and family. Her spokeswoman Valerie Warycha declined to elaborate further. The 2020 election \u2013 and then-President Donald Trump\u2019s baseless claims of widespread election fraud \u2013 brought intense scrutiny to even little-known officials who played largely ministerial roles in certifying results. In the battleground state of Michigan, a Republican member of the state canvassing board, Aaron Van Langevelde recently lost his seat on the four-member panel. The job is largely unpaid, save for a $75-per-meeting stipend. Van Langevelde did not respond to a CNN interview request this week. The lowkey Republican attorney gained national attention when he joined two Democrats last November in voting to grant the state\u2019s 16 electoral votes to Joe Biden \u2013 amid intense pressure from national and state Republican officials to delay the certification. \u201cWe must not attempt to exercise power we don\u2019t have,\u201d Van Langevelde said at the time in voting to certify the results. Van Langevelde\u2019s term expired last month, and the state\u2019s Republican Party did not renominate him after his pivotal vote. He was replaced by Michigan conservative activist Tony Daunt, who praised his predecessor\u2019s \u201chonor and integrity.\u201d In Pennsylvania, in what the state\u2019s Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf described as \u201chuman error\u201d in Boockvar\u2019s office, election officials failed to advertise an amendment to the state constitution that would have extended the timeline for survivors of child-sexual abuse to pursue legal action against their abusers. Boockvar resigned February 5. Wolf said Boockvar\u2019s departure was not related the administration of the 2020 election, which he described as \u201cfair and accurate.\u201d But he said the mistake was \u201cheartbreaking for thousands of survivors of childhood sexual assault.\u201d In Georgia, the decision by the elections board on Tuesday to terminate Barron was a direct outgrowth of the 2020 election and has set off a scramble over who is in charge of elections in a county with roughly 800,000 voters. Barron oversaw a June primary plagued by long voting lines and complaints that voters had failed to receive their absentee ballots by mail. Subsequent elections, including the January 5 Senate runoff elections, however, appeared to operate more smoothly. In voting Tuesday to remove Barron, board members cited the need to improve the administration of elections. \u201cThis is not political,\u201d said Kathleen Ruth, a Republican appointee on the elections board. \u201cThis is a bipartisan vote. The department needs new leadership that can take Fulton to the next level.\u201d Barron did not respond to interview requests after Tuesday\u2019s vote. But in a recent interview with CNN, he said he was discouraged by the criticism after a 21-year career. He described racial taunts against his staff and harassment of election workers as they ran multiple elections amid the coronavirus outbreak. \u201cNo matter what we did, no one was happy with anything,\u201d he said. Barron had been particularly outspoken about the conspiracy theories that arose around voting in Fulton County once Biden won the presidential race in Georgia. A prosecutor in Fulton County recently announced she was investigating Trump for his \u201cattempts to influence the administration of the 2020 Georgia general election.\u201d The probe stems from a call Trump made to Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger that urged the Raffensperger to \u201cfind\u201d votes. In the call, Trump made repeated references to unproven allegations of fraud in Fulton County. This week, Carter Jones, a nonpartisan monitor assigned to review Fulton County\u2019s operations, told the state elections board that he uncovered signs of \u201csystemic disorganization\u201d in the election office. But Jones said he found no evidence of \u201cillegality, fraud or intentional malfeasance\u201d and added that firing Barron was \u201cnot a shortcut to fixing\u201d mismanagement issues. A county spokeswoman said Barron remains in his post for the time being, after the county\u2019s board of commissioners deadlocked by a 3-3 vote Wednesday on whether to ratify the elections board\u2019s decision. The county commission is expected to revisit Barron\u2019s future at its next meeting on March 3. CNN\u2019s Haley Burton contributed to this story.",

            "article_content": "The Democratic chairman of the House Homeland Security Committee has filed a lawsuit against former President Donald Trump that cites a little-known federal statute that was first passed after the Civil War. The complaint, filed Tuesday by Democratic Rep. Bennie Thompson of Mississippi, accuses Trump, his attorney Rudy Giuliani, the Proud Boys and the Oath Keepers of violating the 1871 Ku Klux Klan Act. The lawsuit accuses them  of inciting the Jan. 6 Capitol riot to prevent the certification of the 2020 presidential election. The NAACP is backing the lawsuit, with other members of Congress planning to join it as plaintiffs in the coming days and weeks. Thompson and NAACP leaders say they want Trump to be held accountable for his role in the insurrection. \u201cWhile the majority of Republicans in the Senate abdicated their responsibility to hold the President accountable, we must hold him accountable for the insurrection that he so blatantly planned,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cFailure to do so will only invite this type of authoritarianism for the anti-democratic forces on the far right that are so intent on destroying our country.\u201d Jason Miller, a spokesman for Trump, said the former President did not incite or work to incite riots at the Capitol. \u201cPresident Trump has been acquitted in the Democrats\u2019 latest Impeachment Witch Hunt, and the facts are irrefutable,\u201d Miller said in a statement. \u201cPresident Trump did not plan, produce or organize the Jan. 6th rally on the Ellipse. President Trump did not incite or conspire to incite any violence at the Capitol on Jan. 6th.\u201d Giuliani did not immediately respond to a request for comment. The Civil War era statute mentioned in the lawsuit is scarcely used but reflects historic efforts to thwart members of Congress. Here is what we know about it. The federal statute was passed after the Civil War to combat violence by the KKK and allow civil action to be taken against people who use \u201cforce, intimidation, or threat\u201d to prevent anyone from upholding the duties of their office. It bans people from engaging in conspiracies and violence to block members of Congress from doing their jobs. Jon Greenbaum, chief counsel and senior deputy director for the Lawyers\u2019 Committee for Civil Rights, said that the Ku Klux Klan Act is used when there are specific threats, including actions that threaten the right to vote and prevent federal officers from doing their jobs. \u201cIf you have the right facts it\u2019s something that can be a powerful tool,\u201d Greenbaum said. \u201cI don\u2019t think people necessarily understand the Ku Klux Klan Act very well because it isn\u2019t something that has been used that much, it\u2019s a pretty technical statute and of course, it applies more broadly than to Ku Klux Klan activities.\u201d Joseph Sellers, an attorney representing Thompson and the NAACP in the lawsuit, called Trump, Giuliani and the two groups the \u201cprincipal architects\u201d of the insurrection and said the historic KKK law should be used to protect Congress members who were impacted that day. \u201cUnfortunately, we are again needing to invoke the same statute to ensure protections with members of Congress who were threatened and subjected to intimidation,\u201d Sellers said Tuesday. \u201cAs you heard Congressman Thompson speak about, suffered real harm during the course of the insurrection and other events that gave rise to it.\u201d At the time it was passed, the law was intended to protect Black people and members of Congress from being terrorized by the KKK. The KKK had particularly been known to use threats, assaults and destruction to influence elections and intimidate White Republicans who were attempting to participate in the reunited National Congress. The group also sought to reverse and block Reconstruction-era activities in the South that gave Black people political power and civil rights. \u201cIt was specifically meant to provide federal civil remedies for federal officers who were prevented from performing their duties by two or more individuals, whether federal marshals in the post-Civil War South, federal judges in un-reconstructed lower courts; or federal legislators,\u201d University of Texas Law professor and Supreme Court analyst Stephen Vladeck said. Vladeck, who\u2019s also a CNN contributor, said the provisions of the law can easily be applied to the Jan. 6 riots given that two or more people conspired to stop Congress from \u201cperforming its constitutional function of certifying President Biden\u2019s Electoral College victory.\u201d Aziz Huq, a professor of law at the University of Chicago and a former civil rights attorney, said the Ku Klux Klan Act was a response to the emergence of the KKK as a kind of instrument for reestablishing racial hierarchies in the South. Huq said that initially the law lost momentum because the Supreme Court had a series of rulings that were very hostile, particularly to civil rights claimants such as Black people facing violence in the South. There was also a national movement away from the idea of Southern Reconstruction, Huq said. While the statute is rarely used, a handful of lawsuits in recent years have cited it. Notably, Trump was already facing a lawsuit that alleges he violated the KKK act when he attempted to overturn the election results of major cities last year. The NAACP Legal Defense & Educational Fund filed the lawsuit in December, saying Trump disenfranchised voters of color by trying to \u201cslow and stop vote counting efforts in tightly contested states.\u201d Last year, the National Coalition on Black Civic Participation filed a federal lawsuit against right-wing political operatives Jack Burkman and Jacob Wohl, saying they violated the KKK act when they \u201cconspired to intimidate and threaten many thousands of eligible voters.\u201d Burkman and Wohl were accused of targeting Black voters in 85,000 robocalls that spread false information about voting by mail. The statute was also cited last year in a lawsuit filed by St. Louis Circuit Attorney Kimberly M. Gardner that claimed a police union used a racially motivated conspiracy against her. Gardner, a Black woman, said the police union harassed and intimidated her and city officials attempted to silence her and remove her from office. The lawsuit, which was ultimately dismissed, alleged that these were attempts to block her reform efforts. CNN\u2019s Nicole Chavez and Jessica Schneider contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "President Joe Biden was pressed on a range of issues Tuesday evening as he fielded questions from voters during a CNN town hall in Milwaukee. The President addressed everything from coronavirus vaccine equity to police funding in his first face-to-face engagement with voters since taking office. Multiple participants \u2013 including two who voted for former President Donald Trump \u2013 said they felt Biden answered their questions, even if it wasn\u2019t exactly what one of the Trump voters wanted to hear. The event started with Kevin Michel, a mechanical engineer and political independent who asked a question about resuming in-person learning. Michel told CNN that Biden had answered his question \u201cquite well.\u201d Biden had told Michel that \u201cthere are certain things that make it rational and easy to go back to the brick-and-mortar building,\u201d before pointing to the administration\u2019s guidance on smaller classroom pods and an accelerated timeline for K-8 schooling compared with high school and college. Mitchel told CNN he was happy to hear that Biden was \u201ca big proponent\u201d of getting kids back in schools and that while the President had spent some time on \u201carbitrary\u201d numbers in his answer, the response was \u201cwhat I was looking for.\u201d In one of the night\u2019s more personal moments, Jessica Salas \u2013 a graphic designer from Milwaukee \u2013 told Biden that her two young children often ask her about whether they will get Covid-19 and die. She stood next to her 8-year-old daughter, Layla, as she spoke about how the pandemic is especially frightening for children who don\u2019t fully understand what is happening. \u201cDon\u2019t be scared, honey. Don\u2019t be scared. You\u2019re going to be fine, and we\u2019re going to make sure mommy\u2019s fine, too,\u201d Biden said, addressing the second-grader. Layla told CNN Wednesday that she was nervous to talk to the President, but that he made her feel better. \u201cIt made me feel better that I would be safe in this pandemic,\u201d she told CNN\u2019s John Berman on \u201cNew Day.\u201d Layla, who has also been in virtual school with her brother since March, also told Berman what she misses most about learning in person. \u201cI\u2019ve missed actually being in contact with people around me. I also miss just learning there in person, because to me, it\u2019s better to learn there in person than virtual,\u201d she said. Salas told CNN after the town hall that Biden addressing her daughter like that was a \u201ctotally unexpected\u201d moment. \u201cAnd that was really, really awesome. Afterwards she was like, \u2018Mommy, he told us everything\u2019s gonna be OK.\u2019 Which, obviously wasn\u2019t his exact words, but the fact that she felt his sentiment meant a lot,\u201d Salas said. She added that she wished Biden had committed to looking more at vaccines for children as his inoculation effort ramps up, emphasizing that her kids are \u201cgenuinely interested in getting the vaccine.\u201d \u201cI mean, because he is such a genuine person and that really came across, I can only hope that that is his intention. He just didn\u2019t say it,\u201d she said. Kerri Engebrecht, whose teenage son is immunocompromised by his chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, also asked Biden about his vaccine strategy. \u201cHe does all he can to protect himself,\u201d Engebrecht told Biden of her son. \u201cLast month, he even removed himself from the campus of UW Madison, as he feels it\u2019s safer, and he has less exposure here at home. We\u2019ve tried all we can to get him a vaccine. I hear of others who are less vulnerable, getting it based on far less.\u201d She asked if Biden had a plan to vaccinate those who are most vulnerable sooner, and the President explained that he can\u2019t tell the states to prioritize certain groups of people but he can make certain recommendations and he would like to help her. \u201cIf you\u2019re willing, I\u2019ll stay around after this is over and maybe we can talk a few minutes and see if I can get you some help,\u201d the President said. Engebrecht told CNN: \u201cDo I feel he answered my question? Yes. But we aren\u2019t looking for any favors. We aren\u2019t looking for my son to necessarily just get a vaccine. We\u2019re looking at a change in the whole process in how vaccines are distributed.\u201d Her son, she explained, \u201cwould love a vaccine and it would get him back to living a typical college life and being with his peers. He\u2019s not even sure that, given the opportunity, he would accept it because that was not the point.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re not just looking for a handout or a favor. We\u2019re looking for a change in the process,\u201d she said. Engebrecht told CNN that while she didn\u2019t talk with Biden immediately after the event, he has her contact information and she\u2019s hoping to hear from him soon. Biden also addressed racial disparities in enforcement of drug use Tuesday evening, telling town hall participant Dannie Evans \u2013 a pastor and member of the Wisconsin Racial Disparity Task Force who voted for Trump \u2013 that he believed no one should be imprisoned for using an illegal drug. \u201cHow can we be sure that we don\u2019t over-legislate police officers so that they can do their job to protect the law-abiding citizens who live in these high-crime neighborhoods and yet train officers to police with compassion?\u201d Evans had asked. \u201cBy, number one, not defunding the police,\u201d replied Biden. Evans told CNN that he appreciated the way the President had \u201cmade that absolutely clear.\u201d \u201cHe answered my question. He was firm when he said don\u2019t defund the police. And that\u2019s what I really was hoping that he would say.\u201d Randy Lange \u2013 another independent who supported Trump in the 2020 election \u2013 told CNN that Biden\u2019s answer to his question about raising the minimum wage and small businesses was \u201cwhat I thought he would say.\u201d The President had defended his administration\u2019s call to raise the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour but hedged that \u201cit\u2019s about doing it gradually.\u201d Lange told CNN of Biden\u2019s response: \u201cI understand his position. I respect it, but think it\u2019s going to have consequences.\u201d CNN\u2019s Chandelis Duster contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Former President Donald Trump\u2019s impeachment defense was dishonest from start to finish. Prior to Trump\u2019s Senate acquittal on Saturday on a charge that he incited the January 6 insurrection at the Capitol, Trump lawyer Michael van der Veen delivered a closing argument that was replete with false and misleading claims. This followed a Friday session in which van der Veen delivered other false and misleading claims. Which followed a Monday written filing in which van der Veen and his colleagues delivered still more false and misleading claims. Here is a fact check of some of the things van der Veen said on Saturday, plus a fact check of a false claim made by a Democratic impeachment manager during Saturday\u2019s closing arguments. Van der Veen claimed that the insurrection at the Capitol was \u201cpreplanned and premeditated by fringe left and right groups.\u201d Facts First: This is false: there is no evidence that left-wing groups were involved in planning or participating in the insurrection. Members of right-wing groups, conversely, have been charged with both planning and participating. Though Trump\u2019s legal team has repeatedly attempted to muddy the waters, the evidence shows it was Trump supporters who were overwhelmingly responsible for the attack. Numerous participants are alleged in court documents to have told the FBI their actions were motivated by their support for Trump \u2013 and some have even said they felt they had been directly instructed by Trump to take action. While some alleged participants have idiosyncratic political histories and hard-to-pinpoint ideologies, there is no basis for the suggestion that organized left-wing entities were involved in the insurrection. It\u2019s also important to note that some of the criminal behavior that day was allegedly planned in advance, but some was not. Only a handful of the 200-plus criminal cases filed to date indicate that rioters had showed up that day with the intention of breaching the Capitol. Van der Veen said that the House impeachment managers had not shown \u201ca single example of Mr. Trump urging anyone to engage in violence of any kind.\u201d He then added: \u201cAt no point did you hear anything that could ever possibly be construed as Mr. Trump encouraging or sanctioning an insurrection. Senators, you did not hear those tapes because they do not exist.\u201d Facts First: It is obviously not true that Trump has not made any comments that could even \u201cpossibly\u201d be construed as encouraging or sanctioning an insurrection. Multiple alleged insurrectionists or their lawyers have claimed to the FBI or in court that Trump\u2019s words inspired them to action that day. It\u2019s possible that some of the people who are facing charges are simply trying to shift blame to Trump after the fact. But it is abundantly clear Trump\u2019s words were understood by some listeners as a presidential endorsement of an uprising. Van der Veen said: \u201cMr. Trump did not spend the weeks prior to January 6 inciting violence. He spent those weeks pursuing his election challenge through the court system and other legal procedures, exactly as the Constitution and the Congress prescribed.\u201d Facts First: This is a highly incomplete account of Trump\u2019s behavior after the election. Rather than simply file lawsuits and await court decisions, Trump mounted a relentless public campaign to convince his supporters of the lie that they had been cheated out of victory. He also urged supporters to come to Washington for a January 6 protest he promised would be \u201cwild.\u201d Van der Veen echoed false attacks Trump himself had made in the past, claiming President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris \u201crepeatedly refused to condemn\u201d acts of violence during riots last year. Facts First: This is false. Both Biden and Harris condemned riots and violence last year on multiple occasions. They expressed support for peaceful protest. In August, Biden said, \u201cI want to be very clear about all of this: Rioting is not protesting. Looting is not protesting. Setting fires is not protesting. None of this is protesting. It\u2019s lawlessness, plain and simple. And those who do it should be prosecuted. Violence will not bring change, it will only bring destruction. It\u2019s wrong in every way.\u201d Harris distinguished between peaceful and violent protest in her own August statement, saying, \u201cWe must always defend peaceful protest and peaceful protesters. We should not confuse them with those looting and committing acts of violence.\u201d She added, \u201cWe will not let these vigilantes and extremists derail the path to justice.\u201d In October, Biden and Harris issued a joint statement following the fatal police shooting of Walter Wallace Jr., a Black man in Philadelphia who was carrying a knife during what his family said was a mental health crisis. Biden and Harris said that \u201cno amount of anger at the very real injustices in our society excuses violence\u201d and that \u201clooting is not a protest, it is a crime.\u201d Van der Veen claimed that it was Democrats\u2019 fault that there were constitutional questions about holding an impeachment trial for a president who is no longer in office. He said, \u201cThey sat on the article. They could have tried the President while he was still in office if they really believed he was an imminent threat. They didn\u2019t.\u201d Facts First: It is inaccurate for van der Veen to pin sole blame on the Democrats for the Senate\u2019s decision to hold the trial after Trump left office. Democrats did propose to try Trump while he was still in office; it was Republican Sen. Mitch McConnell, then the majority leader, who rejected the idea, rebuffing Democrats\u2019 suggestion of bringing the Senate back on an emergency basis for a trial before Biden\u2019s inauguration. McConnell said on January 13, the day the House voted to impeach Trump, that there was no chance a \u201cfair or serious\u201d Senate trial could be completed before the inauguration. One of the Democratic House impeachment managers, Rep. Madeleine Dean of Pennsylvania, spoke during closing arguments about Trump\u2019s rhetoric before the insurrection. \u201cDonald Trump knew the people he was inciting. Leading up to January the 6th, he saw the violence they were capable of. He had a pattern and practice of praising and encouraging supporters of violence \u2013 never condemning it,\u201d Dean said. Facts First: It\u2019s true that Trump had a pattern of encouraging or applauding supporters of violence; we listed nine examples in a fact check Friday. But it\u2019s not true that Trump \u201cnever\u201d condemned violence or support for violence. Trump has issued repeated condemnations. Trump was vocal last year in his denunciation of violence connected to racial justice protests and violence allegedly associated with the Antifa movement. In both cases, he was transparent in his efforts to use these incidents as a cudgel against his Democratic opponents. But he has also condemned violence of other kinds on multiple other occasions. These include an anti-Semitic massacre at a Pittsburgh synagogue in 2018, the mailing of bombs in 2018 to Trump\u2019s political opponents and CNN, mass shootings in Texas and Ohio in 2019, and an anti-Semitic stabbing attack in New York in 2019. \u201cNo nation can succeed that tolerates violence or the threat of violence as a method of political intimidation, coercion, or control. We all know that. Such conduct must be fiercely opposed and firmly prosecuted,\u201d he said in one October 2018 speech in which he discussed the mail bombs.",

            "article_content": "A version of this story appeared in CNN\u2019s What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here. Former President Donald Trump\u2019s defense team used just a few of the 16 hours they were allotted to make their case for his acquittal on Friday, and encouraged senators to use the rest of the time on Covid relief. It was simple and it was quick. Here\u2019s what they argued: The political speech defense. Their basic thrust was that Trump was totally misconstrued. He didn\u2019t mean tell his supporters to literally go \u201cfight\u201d on Capitol Hill before they turned into a riotous mob that sacked the Senate. He meant they should be fighters in the political sense of the word and find primary challengers to Republicans. (Don\u2019t think the Republican senators in the chamber didn\u2019t hear that word \u2013 primary \u2013 and shudder.) The free speech defense. They detailed the importance of freedom of expression and argued that Trump\u2019s words should be protected. They cited multiple court cases, including Brandenburg v. Ohio, to argue Trump did not meet the legal threshold of incitement, although this is not a legal proceeding. The Trump didn\u2019t have anything to do with the violence defense. They argued, like the Democrats, that the march was preplanned. But they argued it was preplanned as an attack and by criminals, not by Trump, citing evidence that a pipe bomb on Capitol Hill was planted before January 6. The they-do-it-too defense. The defense team focused in depth on Democratic senators in the chamber and representatives who argued the impeachment case, playing video of them using the word \u201cfight\u201d in political speech. But rioters didn\u2019t attack the Capitol after Democrats used the word. The political grudge defense. Trump\u2019s lawyers argued the Democrats weren\u2019t trying to protect the Constitution but to rob American voters of a choice in future elections. (This argument has always confused me since Trump, by rejecting the election results, has been trying to rob a larger number of Americans of their voices in opposing him.) The what-about-them defense. Without defending the rioters, the defense team argued the riot at the Capitol was not unlike violence that broke out after rallies for racial justice over the summer. Trump was forceful in rejecting that violence. The out-of-context defense. They played longer portions of Trump comments and speeches and argued that impeachment managers had mangled his words. This was a somewhat effective line until the defense team played video of Trump defending protesters in Charlottesville who wanted to keep a statue of Robert E. Lee. People died in that event too. They said he had amplified a tweet that the calvary \u2013 a religious word \u2013 was coming, not that the cavalry \u2013 a military term \u2013 was coming. Similarly, the defense efforts to distance Trump from the mob and focus on the moments where he halfheartedly asked them to be peaceful ignored the literal love and thanks he showed them as they were rampaging through the Capitol complex. They also tried to defend Trump\u2019s phone call with Georgia\u2019s Republican secretary of state, arguing that he hadn\u2019t been asking the official, Brad Raffensperger, to find votes, but rather to do more signature verification, which Trump believed would result in more votes for him. Constitutional cancel culture. Here\u2019s the defense in one passage from attorney Bruce Castor: This trial is about far more than President Trump. It is about silencing and banning the speech the majority does not agree with. It is about canceling 75 million Trump voters and criminalizing political viewpoints. That is what this trial is really about. It\u2019s the only existential issue before us. It asks for constitutional cancel culture to take over in the United States Senate. Are we going to allow canceling and banning and silencing to be sanctioned in this body? Will this defense work? Yes, in that Trump will likely be acquitted. \u201cWhat they are looking for, so many of these Republican senators, most of them, I would even say, is a way out and a way to vote to acquit,\u201d said Dana Bash on CNN after the defense ended its case. But it may be a harder sell among a larger body of Americans expected to suspend common sense to agree with the Trump defenses. Read a fact check of the defense from CNN\u2019s Daniel Dale, Tara Subramaniam and Holmes Lybrand. My editor Allison Hoffman had the single most important takeaway I\u2019ve seen: The good news is, Trump and his lawyers have to throw the rioters under the bus to make his defense work. The bad news is, it\u2019s either with a wink, or it\u2019s license for these violent, subversive and anti-democratic elements to go even further, without Trump at the helm. They will just corrode the system \u2013 in state capitols, on state and local election boards, on school boards. And in that sense it doesn\u2019t matter whether Trump is convicted or acquitted. This movement \u2013 whatever you want to call the stew of Q and Proud Boys and Oath Keepers and others \u2013 is now abroad everywhere in the country, and it needs to be met at every level up and down the government. Ahead of schedule, senators moved straight to question time Friday night. They could ask questions, in writing, and they\u2019re usually more important as leading indicators of where different groups of senators are leaning. There were interesting questions from Sens. Mitt Romney, Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski \u2013 Republicans who seem likely to vote to convict \u2013 about when Trump knew the Capitol was in danger, what exactly he did to protect it, and whether he knew about the danger faced by Vice President Mike Pence. There were not good answers to those, since impeachment managers relied mostly on the public record to put forward their case. Trump\u2019s defense team has argued the lack of a thorough investigation is a problem with the case against the former President. Ask Nikki Haley. Keep an eye on Republicans who seem likely to run for president in 2024. Haley, a former South Carolina governor and US ambassador to the UN, would top anyone\u2019s list. She gave a series of interviews to Politico that were published Friday and CNN\u2019s Chris Cillizza picked out these two most eye-opening quotes. First, about Trump: \u201cWe need to acknowledge he let us down. He went down a path he shouldn\u2019t have, and we shouldn\u2019t have followed him, and we shouldn\u2019t have listened to him. And we can\u2019t let that ever happen again.\u201d And this one about Trump\u2019s political future: \u201cHe\u2019s not going to run for federal office again. \u2026 I don\u2019t think he\u2019s going to be in the picture. I don\u2019t think he can. He\u2019s fallen so far.\u201d Writes Cillizza: That this interview comes out just after the House impeachment managers concluded their case in the Senate impeachment trial \u2013 laying out a damning presentation detailing Trump\u2019s long stoking of the resentment, victimhood and hate that bubbled over on January 6 \u2013 seems like more than a coincidence. (My general rule is that there are no coincidences in politics at this level.) This is the moment where Trump is, arguably, as low as he has ever been politically. He\u2019s not out. But he\u2019s definitely down. And Haley is making her move to knock him out once and for all. (The student has become the master \u2013 and all that.) Haley knows that, within the Republican Party Trump created, she is one of the very few who could deliver that sort of knockout blow. Contradictory hot take. I agree with Cillizza that this is Haley putting space between herself and Trump. I don\u2019t think she has the ability to do much more than ride the wave here, however. She\u2019s a good politician. But she does not lead a base movement of Republicans. Trump does.",

            "article_content": "Former President Donald Trump\u2019s lawyers mounted an aggressive defense Friday in Trump\u2019s second impeachment trial \u2013 and made multiple false and misleading claims to bolster their case. Arguing that Trump did nothing to incite the insurrection at the US Capitol on January 6, the lawyers distorted the facts about both what happened that day and what happened in the past. Here is a fact check of some of their claims: Trump lawyer Michael van der Veen highlighted comments from Democrats that he suggested had promoted or defended violence. Trump, he argued, is different than these Democrats. \u201cContrast the President\u2019s repeated condemnations of violence with the rhetoric from his opponents,\u201d van der Veen said. He then played a video that juxtaposed clips of Trump condemning violence, and calling himself an \u201cally of all peaceful protesters,\u201d with some selectively edited clips of Democrats. Facts First: This argument and video were misleading by omission. Trump has indeed condemned violence and called for peaceful protest, but he has also repeatedly applauded or defended violence and aggressive behavior. Among other things, Trump has done the following since he launched his presidential campaign in 2015: praised a Republican congressman for assaulting a journalist; urged police officers not to worry about injuring the heads of suspects they are arresting; said he would like to punch a protester in the face; urged supporters to \u201cknock the crap out of\u201d any protester they saw holding a tomato; said a kidnapping plot against Michigan Democratic Gov. Gretchen Whitmer might not be an actual \u201cproblem\u201d; approvingly told a fake story about an early 20th century US general who massacred Muslim terrorists with bullets dipped in the blood of pigs; said it was a \u201cbeautiful sight\u201d when the authorities tossed a journalist to the ground during unrest in Minneapolis; mocked a reporter who got shot with a rubber bullet; and applauded the Trump supporters who surrounded a Joe Biden campaign bus on the highway, an incident that prompted an FBI investigation. Van der Veen claimed that \u201cthe first two messages the President sent via Twitter once the incursion of the Capitol began\u201d urged people to \u201cstay peaceful\u201d and called for \u201cno violence.\u201d Facts First: This is not true. Trump\u2019s \u201cstay peaceful\u201d tweet at 2:38 p.m. and \u201cno violence\u201d tweet at 3:13 p.m. were his second and third tweeted messages after the Capitol was breached, not his first. Trump\u2019s first tweet was at 2:24 p.m.: \u201cMike Pence didn\u2019t have the courage to do what should have been done to protect our Country and our Constitution, giving States a chance to certify a corrected set of facts, not the fraudulent or inaccurate ones which they were asked to previously certify. USA demands the truth!\u201d Rioters had already entered the US Capitol building by the time of the Trump tweet about Pence. Van der Veen claimed that Washington officials other than Trump are the ones who used reckless and inflammatory rhetoric. He claimed: \u201cThe entire Democratic Party and national news media spent the last four years repeating without any evidence that the 2016 election had been hacked.\u201d Facts First: The Democratic National Committee and the Hillary Clinton campaign were indeed hacked during the 2016 election campaign; this is a fact, not a claim made \u201cwithout any evidence.\u201d The US intelligence community, special counsel Robert Mueller and the bipartisan Senate Intelligence Committee all concluded that the Russian government was responsible for stealing and leaking internal documents and emails. If van der Veen was suggesting that the \u201centire Democratic Party and national media\u201d spent four years falsely alleging that hackers altered actual votes or vote totals in the 2016 election, that would not be true either. We can\u2019t speak for every word uttered by every Democrat or every journalist since 2016, but it is clearly inaccurate to say that the entire party or entire media spent four years pushing such a claim. The national discussion about hacking during the 2016 election focused on the actual, confirmed hacking that targeted the Democrats\u2019 computer systems. Trump\u2019s lawyer Bruce Castor claimed that the rioters who stormed the Capitol didn\u2019t attend the ex-President\u2019s incendiary speech that day, and that this proved the insurrection was a pre-planned attack that wasn\u2019t incited by Trump. \u201cGiven the timeline of events, the criminals at the Capitol weren\u2019t there at the Ellipse to even hear the President\u2019s words,\u201d Castor said. \u201cThey were more than a mile away, engaged in their pre-planned assault on this very building.\u201d \u201cThis was a pre-planned assault,\u201d Castor said, \u201cmake no mistake.\u201d He also claimed this assertion was \u201cconfirmed by the FBI, Department of Justice and even the House managers.\u201d Facts First: It\u2019s false that none of the accused Capitol rioters attended Trump\u2019s speech beforehand. And Castor is exaggerating the known facts about whether the assault was pre-planned. Ellipse to the Capitol It\u2019s true that the timeline shows that someone who attended the entirety of the speech at the Ellipse could not have been among the very first people to breach the Capitol grounds. But that\u2019s a much narrower claim than the one Trump\u2019s lawyers are making. Court documents and video footage show that some Trump supporters did make this walk from the Ellipse to the Capitol, undermining Castor\u2019s claims. This includes one woman who allegedly went from the Trump speech to her hotel, and then into the Capitol. And all of this ignores the fact that insurrectionists near the Capitol could have listened to Trump\u2019s speech on their phones or could have been inspired by Trump\u2019s previous rhetoric. Pre-planned? The Justice Department and FBI have accused some rioters of planning the attacks before coming to Washington, and top prosecutors have said more charges along those lines are expected. But only a handful of the 200-plus criminal cases indicate that rioters had showed up that day intending to breach the Capitol. Therefore, Castor cherry-picked a few unrepresentative cases from the pool of more than 215 cases to support his misleading assertion that federal investigators \u201cconfirmed\u201d this was a \u201cpre-planned assault.\u201d In interviews with reporters and FBI investigators, some of the rioters said they came to DC for the rally and later got swept up in the crowd as it rushed the Capitol. As evidence of Trump\u2019s efforts to subvert the certification of the 2020 election results, the article of impeachment cites Trump\u2019s call with Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger where Trump asked Raffensperger \u201cto \u2018find\u2019 enough votes to overturn the Georgia presidential election results.\u201d Castor argued Trump\u2019s use of the word \u201cfind\u201d was \u201csolely related to his concerns with the inexplicable dramatic drop in Georgia\u2019s ballot rejection rates.\u201d Facts First: The intent of Trump\u2019s use of the word \u201cfind\u201d aside, Georgia did not experience a \u201cdramatic drop\u201d in ballot rejection rates, according to data from the Georgia Secretary of State\u2019s office. In fact, the total number of absentee ballot rejections increased in direct proportion to the number of additional votes compared to the most recent past election. But ultimately, the percentage of ballot rejections remained the same. The Georgia Secretary of State\u2019s office noted that \u201cthe rejection rate for absentee ballots with missing or non-matching signatures in the 2020 General Election was 0.15%, the same rejection rate for signature issues as the 2018 General Election.\u201d Georgia election official Gabriel Sterling reacted to Castor\u2019s claim on Twitter Friday, stating that \u201cshockingly, the disinformation continues.\u201d Trump\u2019s lawyers argued that Democrats had taken Trump\u2019s words out of context. Castor argued that the House managers had used \u201cselective editing and manipulated visuals.\u201d But the Trump defense team itself clearly did selectively edit its video presentations. For example, moments before this Castor complaint, he had played a video that showed then-candidate Joe Biden saying, of last year\u2019s racial justice protests, \u201cThe vast majority of \u2013 of the protests have been peaceful.\u201d The video then cut immediately to footage of rioting, suggesting that Biden\u2019s claim was wrong. Facts First: This video cut was misleading. Biden was correct when he said that the vast majority of racial justice protests in 2020 were peaceful; he was not describing riots as peaceful. Biden has repeatedly condemned rioting. The video played by Castor was reminiscent of tactics used by Trump\u2019s unsuccessful reelection campaign. Trump himself had inaccurately attempted to convince Americans that Biden had described violence as peaceful protest. Van der Veen argued that the impeachment process was unconstitutional, in part because it violated the due process clause. \u201cThe due process clause applies to this impeachment hearing and it\u2019s been severely and extremely violated,\u201d he said. Facts First: This is false. An impeachment inquiry is a political process, not a criminal case, therefore the constitutional rights of criminal defendants, such as due process, do not apply. The Fifth Amendment, which outlines the right to due process, states that it applies specifically to any criminal case. And as Steve Vladeck, a Supreme Court analyst for CNN and professor at the University of Texas law school, noted ahead of Trump\u2019s first impeachment, \u201cImpeachment is not a criminal prosecution.\u201d Furthermore, William Banks, a law professor at Syracuse University, told CNN, \u201cThere is nothing in the Constitution or any law, nor any rules of the House, that prescribes a particular procedure for impeachment proceedings.\u201d The Constitution details only the basis for impeachment, the potential consequences of impeachment and that the House \u201cshall have the sole power of impeachment\u201d while the Senate \u201cshall have the sole power to try all impeachments.\u201d This story has been updated.

            "article_content": "The House impeachment managers presented senators with videos of their colleagues fleeing a pro-Trump mob, which breached the US Capitol shouting \u201cstop the steal.\u201d They showed the rioters searching for then-Vice President Mike Pence and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, and rummaging through the senators\u2019 desks on the chamber floor. Some of the Trump supporters were dressed in tactical gear, armed with zip-ties. Others held Trump 2020 flags, broke windows with poles and set up a gallows for Pence, who was constitutionally obligated to oversee the certification of the 2020 presidential election, and the peaceful transfer of power to the Democrats. Key moments from the second day of Trump's impeachment trial But even after witnessing the deadly violence firsthand, and being reminded of it again at the scene of the crime, many Republican senators appeared no closer on Wednesday to convicting former President Donald Trump on the charge of \u201cincitement of insurrection.\u201d While they were struck by the impeachment managers\u2019 presentation, these Republicans said that the House Democrats did not prove Trump\u2019s words led to the violent actions. They compared the January 6 riot to last summer\u2019s racial justice protests and criticized how the trial is being handled. Sen. Lindsey Graham said he couldn\u2019t believe \u201cwe could lose the Capitol like that\u201d but added that it didn\u2019t change his mind on whether to acquit Trump during the trial. \u201cI think there\u2019s more votes for acquittal after today than there was yesterday,\u201d the South Carolina Republican said. Sen. Mike Braun said the managers\u2019 visual presentation was \u201criveting,\u201d adding, \u201cIt\u2019s just as kind of hard to take now as it was then.\u201d But when asked if it had changed his view, the Indiana Republican said, \u201cWhen you think the process is flawed in the first place, I think it\u2019s going to be different to arrive at a conclusion on the facts and the merits itself.\u201d And Sen. Ted Cruz said a direct link from Trump to the pro-Trump riot was \u201cstrikingly absent.\u201d The Texas Republican claimed that \u201cthere\u2019s not a political candidate in the country,\u201d including \u201cevery single one of the Democratic senators,\u201d who hasn\u2019t used the same language as Trump, who told his supporters \u201cto fight like hell.\u201d How will GOP senators ignore this? \u201cThey spent a great deal of time focusing on the horrific acts of violence that were played out by the criminals, but the language from the President doesn\u2019t come close to meeting the legal standard for incitement,\u201d Cruz said of the managers\u2019 presentation. The comments are the latest indication of the high hurdles Democrats face in getting the 67 votes needed to convict Trump \u2013 with 17 Republicans needed to break ranks if all 50 Democrats vote to convict the former President and then bar him from ever serving in office again. \u201cIt was reliving a horrible day, a horrible day. That\u2019s not easy,\u201d said Sen. Rob Portman, an Ohio Republican who is retiring at the end of next year. But asked if he\u2019s more likely to convict, Portman said: \u201cWell from the start I\u2019ve said that I think this is about removal. And I think it\u2019s a bad precedent, to be convicting former presidents, private citizens.\u201d The sentiment was echoed by most Senate Republicans. \u201cI think you get at best six Republicans \u2013 probably five and maybe six,\u201d GOP Sen. Tim Scott told CNN when asked if the video and footage changed his mind on convicting Trump. Asked if he considers himself an impartial juror, the South Carolina Republican said: \u201cI think I\u2019m as impartial as the other 99.\u201d The six Republicans could be Sens. Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, Susan Collins of Maine, Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania, Ben Sasse of Nebraska, Mitt Romney of Utah and Bill Cassidy of Louisiana \u2013 the six Republicans who broke with their party Tuesday to vote that the impeachment trial was constitutional. Impeachment managers slated to wrap up their case against Trump at Senate trial Cassidy, facing backlash among local Republicans for that vote, dismissed the idea that GOP grumbling could influence his vote, saying, \u201cMy first loyalty is to the Constitution.\u201d He added he has yet to make up his mind on conviction. \u201cI\u2019m angry, I\u2019m disturbed,\u201d Murkowski said of the video footage. \u201cThe evidence that has been presented is pretty damning.\u201d In a speech before the Capitol rampage, Trump urged his supporters \u201cto peacefully and patriotically make your voices heard\u201d but also to \u201cfight like hell,\u201d \u201cnever give up\u201d and \u201cnever concede.\u201d A couple days earlier, he tweeted that \u201cThe \u2018Surrender Caucus\u2019 within the Republican Party will go down in infamy as weak and ineffective \u2018guardians\u2019 of our Nation, who were willing to accept the certification of fraudulent presidential numbers!\u201d He repeatedly told his supporters to \u201cstop the steal!\u201d During the riot, Trump tried to call Alabama Sen. Tommy Tuberville to delay the certification of his loss and said Pence lacked the \u201ccourage to do what should have been done to protect our Country and our Constitution.\u201d A number of Republicans seemed impressed by the impeachment managers, after sharply criticizing the President\u2019s defense team Tuesday for lacking a coherent response. South Dakota Sen. John Thune, the minority whip and a member of GOP leadership, said that the House managers did an \u201ceffective job\u201d and were \u201cconnecting the dots\u201d from Trump\u2019s words to the insurrection. Yet other members of the Senate GOP leadership made clear where they were headed. Missouri Sen. Roy Blunt, who is up for reelection in 2022 and sits in Senate GOP leadership, made clear the video didn\u2019t change his mind about convicting Trump. \u201cWell, you know, you have a summer where people all over the country are doing similar kinds of things,\u201d Blunt told CNN when asked about the impact the new footage had on his deliberations. \u201cI don\u2019t know what the other side will show from Seattle and Portland and other places, but you\u2019re going to see similar kinds of tragedies there as well.\u201d Others were clearly moved. Romney, the only Republican to vote to convict Trump in his first impeachment trial last year, was shown on screen during the managers\u2019 presentation fleeing the Capitol after Capitol Police officer Eugene Goodman urged him to run in the opposition direction of where he was heading. \u201cObviously very troubling to see the great violence that our Capitol Police and others are subjected to,\u201d Romney said. \u201cIt tears you at your heart and brings tears to your eyes. That was overwhelmingly distressing and emotional.\u201d The Utah Republican said he was \u201cfortunate\u201d to see Goodman there and later spoke to him on the Senate floor Wednesday. \u201cI expressed my appreciation to him for coming to my aid and getting me back into the path of safety.\u201d But when asked whether the scenes shown would change the minds of his fellow Republicans, Romney said, \u201cI can\u2019t predict how other people will react.\u201d For most Republican senators, Wednesday\u2019s presentation did not seem to affect how they\u2019ll vote. Many are on record decrying the trial as unconstitutional since Trump is now a former president, and the punishment for conviction is removal. If convicted, however, Trump could also face a vote in the Senate barring him from ever again serving in public office. Yet GOP senators including Marco Rubio of Florida would only say Trump bears \u201csome responsibility\u201d for the riot and argued the Senate should have no role in trying a former president. \u201cWho wouldn\u2019t be?\u201d asked Sen. Ron Johnson, a Wisconsin Republican, when questioned if he was shaken by the footage he saw on Wednesday. But when asked if he held Trump accountable, Johnson said, \u201cI hold those people responsible.\u201d This story has been updated with additional developments Thursday.

            "article_content": "The stark divide between Republicans and Democrats has mirrored divisions among Americans for many years, but political observers have likened this current period to the Civil War era. For a time, that seemed like an exaggeration \u2013 but not after January 6. Consider two images from the insurrection. One, a White man with a Confederate flag, a symbol of White terror, slung casually over his shoulder standing in the Capitol building. The other, a week after the insurrection, Black national guardsmen in that same building, gathered around Rosa Parks in bronze, sitting primly, yet defiantly in opposition to our American caste system. As detailed in \u201cLincoln: Divided We Stand,\u201d CNN\u2019s six-part Original Series that debuts Sunday, it is those two competing impulses \u2013 advancing White dominance and advocating Black citizenship \u2013 that shaped the decades leading up to Abraham Lincoln\u2019s election, the American Civil War that followed and Lincoln\u2019s assassination. Indeed, it was what John Wilkes Booth called Lincoln\u2019s promise of \u201cn***** citizenship\u201d that drove him to his final breaking point. It is necessary that we consider Lincoln to understand how we got here. Lauded as The Great Emancipator, the presence of 4 million black Americans was complicated for the 16th US President. More than 150 years after he was shot dead and elevated to martyr status, the presence of over 40 million African Americans, 60 million Hispanics and over 20 million Asian Americans is complicated for many White Americans. Consider 2045. That\u2019s the year when America will be a very different country. White Americans will cease to be the majority. \u201cNew census population projections confirm the importance of racial minorities as the primary demographic engine of the nation\u2019s future growth, countering an aging, slow-growing and soon to be declining white population,\u201d wrote William Frey in a report for Brookings. \u201cDuring that year, whites will compromise 49.7% of the population in contrast to 24.6 percent for Hispanics, 13.1% for Blacks, 7.9 % for Asians, and 3.8% for multiracial populations.\u201d This is the backdrop for understanding this current moment and the decades ahead. It is key to understanding Donald Trump\u2019s nostalgia-fueled 2016 run, with its racist rhetoric and embrace of a kind of toxic masculinity. The former President, like so many before him, offered himself up as the only person standing in the way of the onslaught of otherness that threatened to change the country and make America unrecognizable. That change so visible in the most diverse Congress ever, the most diverse Cabinet ever, including Vice President Kamala Harris. And the power of this new America was made visible in Georgia, decimated in the Civil War, and now represented for the first time in the US Senate by an African American and a Jewish man. As Georgians and other Americans celebrated this milestone, an angry crowd of White Americans gathered in Washington, DC, to try to disenfranchise millions of voters in that state and several others. \u201cLincoln certainly would acknowledge how far we have come because we really have, but we\u2019re not there. We\u2019re definitely not there,\u201d said Edna Greene Medford, a professor of history at Howard University, in the CNN series. \u201cAnd in recent times it seems we are going backwards. I think Lincoln would be most disappointed in what we have not accomplished.\u201d Observers noted that during the Civil War, the traitors\u2019 flag never made it to the Capitol like it did on January 6. (A noose was also set up). But, of course, the ideology that flag represented and the leaders who followed it, did. The statue of Parks, the first life-size statue of a Black woman in the Capitol, sits under the gaze of Jefferson Davis. \u201cIt\u2019s important for us to recognize the way that the forces of inequality have reconfigured themselves to fit in a country that is supposed to be defined by justice,\u201d said Christopher Bonner, a historian who appears in the docuseries. \u201cThe problems have old roots but new forms.\u201d The question before the country is similar to what Lincoln faced. How to make and keep America a multiracial democracy? Lincoln began to imagine that America in the last speech of his life. He was killed four days later, and his dreams for Reconstruction were thwarted by white mob violence that ruled well into the 20th century. What gets lost in the lionization of Lincoln as America\u2019s greatest President, is that he evolved on matters of race and Black citizenship. He was deeply anti-Black, wanted to contain, but not eradicate slavery. He was a White supremacist who believed Black people were inferior and would be better off going back to Africa. Yet, by the end of the Civil War, with 700,000 dead he had evolved to see (certain) Black people as worthy of the ballot. It\u2019ll take an even more expansive imagination, and more founding mothers like Rosa Parks, for America to move toward an inclusive multiracial democracy and a new founding.

Ayanna Pressley has called on the country \u201cto address the evil and scourge that is White supremacy,\u201d one month after pro-Donald Trump rioters stormed the US Capitol. \u201cOne of the images that I\u2019m haunted by is the Black custodial staff cleaning up the mess left by that violent White supremacist mob,\u201d the Massachusetts Democrat told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper on \u201cState of the Union\u201d Sunday, reflecting on her experience on Capitol Hill during the deadly siege on January 6. \u201cThat is a metaphor for America. We have been cleaning up after violent, White supremacist mobs for generations and it must end.\u201d Flags, signs and symbols of racist, White supremacist and extremist groups were displayed along with Trump 2020 banners and American flags during the insurrection last month. It took such a \u201charrowing and traumatic\u201d event, Pressley told Tapper, for many Americans to begin to recognize the threat of White supremacy. Trump's second impeachment trial set to kick off this week amid questions about what it will look like The congresswoman\u2019s comments come as the Senate is poised this week to hear arguments in Trump\u2019s impeachment trial, where the chamber will consider whether to convict or acquit him on a single charge of \u201cincitement of insurrection.\u201d While the former President is expected to be acquitted for the second time, Pressley called on her colleagues in Congress to hold Trump accountable. \u201cIf we really believe that this is a moment of reckoning in every way then we must act accordingly, and that means that Donald J. Trump must be held accountable because he is culpable for having incited this insurrection by perpetuating this \u2018big lie,\u2019\u201d she said in reference to Trump\u2019s false claims of widespread voter fraud and that the election was stolen from him. \u201cThis House has twice done its job. He will forever be the twice-impeached President by this Democratic majority-led House,\u201d she continued. But it is not only an issue of impeachment or securing the Capitol, the congresswoman said. \u201cFor those that continue to feign great surprise about what happened on January 6. As a Black woman, to be barricaded in my office, using office furniture and water bottles on the ground in the dark that terror, those moments of terror, is familiar in a deep and ancestral way for me,\u201d Pressley said, referencing the racial history of Black Americans in the US. \u201cI want us to do everything to ensure that a breach like this never occurs at the Capitol, but I want us to address the evil and scourge that is White supremacy in this nation. This is not only about securing the Capitol to ensure that members and our staffs and custodial staff and food service workers are safe in the Capitol. It is that we are safe in America.\u201d CNN has previously reported that White Americans are receiving vaccinations for the coronavirus at much higher rates than Black and Latino Americans, despite data from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention showing Black and Latino Americans are already dying of Covid-19 at three times the rate of White people and being hospitalized at a rate four times higher. Weighing in on those disparities Sunday, Pressley said while she is encouraged that there is a national strategy on distribution, she thinks more needs to be done. \u201cWe knew early on what communities would be hardest hit because of unequal access to health care and the comorbidities of structural racism,\u201d she told Tapper.",

            "article_content": "The collision of the new President\u2019s agenda with the old one\u2019s impeachment trial this week sharpens the question: Just what kind of Republican opposition does the Democrat in the White House face? If the GOP remains an honest voice for a wide swath of Americans in the democratic competition of ideas, President Joe Biden has reason to follow his instincts toward common ground on Covid-19 relief and the rest of his agenda. But if the GOP has devolved into something else \u2013 dishonest, detached from reality, bent on gaining power by undemocratic means if necessary \u2013 he can justify skipping the time and effort. Biden has straddled the question so far. But Republican leaders plainly fear the party risks forfeiting its historic claim as the mainstream conservative alternative to Democratic liberalism. Distinguishing his party from Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky warned last week that \u201cloony lies and conspiracy theories are cancer for the Republican Party and our country.\u201d The 2012 GOP presidential nominee, now-Sen. Mitt Romney of Utah, called the Republican tent \u201cnot large enough to both accommodate conservatives and kooks.\u201d   Yet House Republican leaders refused to sanction Greene for having suggested violence against political opponents. The party remains in thrall to former President Donald Trump, even after his flagrant lies about the 2020 election incited a deadly insurrection at the US Capitol. Most GOP senators, who begin weighing impeachment charges this week, have already voted to shield Trump by declaring the trial unconstitutional. Most House Republicans have done the same, concluding that challenging the disgraced ex-President is crazier than any QAnon fantasy. \u201cThe broad picture of the Republican Party is really ugly,\u201d says Jack Pitney, a former national GOP official who now teaches political science at Claremont McKenna College in California. \u201cA hot mess of nuts and cowards.\u201d Larry Sabato, the nonpartisan director of the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia, has concluded after events of the past three months that America\u2019s two-party system now has one normally functioning entity and another that appears \u201cinsane.\u201d \u201cThe Republican Party is unsalvageable as a center-right party,\u201d says Sabato. \u201cYou can\u2019t treat the situation as normal.\u201d It\u2019s tempting to assume the situation will revert to normal. The GOP has endured for the better part of two centuries as the champion of one of America\u2019s two core philosophic traditions. Of the last 26 presidential elections, Republicans have won 13. It could easily win the next one \u2013 and recapture both chambers of Congress before then. But the party\u2019s beliefs and behavior have changed in tandem with its anxierty about long-term decline. Republicans have grown increasingly dependent on the votes of working-class Whites who fear that cultural and economic change leaves them behind in the diversifying, globally connected America of the 21st century. Those changes grew more vivid after Barack Obama\u2019s 2008 victory made him the first Black president. Trump gained a following by propagating the racist lie that Obama hadn\u2019t been born in the United States and thus could not legitimately hold the office. Inside Congress, an increasingly combative House GOP caucus blocked its leaders from compromising with Obama. McConnell worked to deny Obama\u2019s agenda bipartisan legitimacy by dissuading fellow Republicans from helping him; eventually he blocked the Senate from even considering an Obama Supreme Court nominee. The party entertained changing direction after Obama won a second term in 2012. A post-election \u201cautopsy\u201d presented by then-Chairman Reince Priebus \u2013 later Trump\u2019s first chief of staff \u2013 called for steps to make the GOP more competitive by broadening its appeal to women, non-Whites and young voters. As Trump\u2019s appeals to racial resentment gained traction in the 2016 campaign, GOP rival Rick Perry called him a \u201ccancer\u201d on conservatism. Then Trump and his fervent base bowled over the field. Priebus went into the West Wing; Perry joined Trump\u2019s Cabinet, after a turn on \u201cDancing with the Stars.\u201d Last fall, McConnell abandoned the principle he made up to justify blocking Obama\u2019s court pick to replace the late conservative Justice Antonin Scalia \u2013 that it was too close to a presidential election \u2013 to muscle through Trump\u2019s nominee Amy Coney Barrett even closer to Election Day. Following Biden\u2019s victory, Republican leaders encouraged Trump\u2019s strongman posture by facilitating his lies that the election had been stolen. With the electorate drifting against them, they now seek to make it harder to vote. Republican militancy creates ferocious headwinds against any Biden attempt at bipartisan compromise. \u201cHe has to deal with an increasing number who operate outside any traditional definition of conservatism,\u201d says Phil Schiliro, who served as Obama\u2019s liaison to Congress. \u201cThat\u2019s an enormous challenge.\u201d Ten of 50 Republican senators made Biden an initial Covid-relief offer nowhere near the new President\u2019s proposal. More, heeding the demands of their inflamed rank and file, have offered instant hostility; Florida\u2019s Sen. Marco Rubio accused Biden of having \u201cgoverned from the radical left\u201d less than 48 hours into his term. \u201cThe Republican Party is at this point hostage to a base that does not approve of it governing,\u201d says Geoffrey Kabaservice, author of \u201cRule and Ruin: The Downfall of Moderation and the Destruction of the Republican Party.\u201d \u201cDo I think the Republican Party\u2019s going to stand up to its base? Not anytime soon.\u201d With opposition like that, Sabato says Democrats would be justified in ramming through whatever legislation they can with their fleeting grasp of power. Many of their goals, including legislation to protect voting rights, would require abolishing the Senate filibuster. McConnell warns of a \u201cnightmare\u201d turnabout when Republicans regain the upper hand. But Pitney \u2013 who once worked alongside the legendarily bare-knuckled GOP operative Lee Atwater \u2013 says Republicans wouldn\u2019t hesitate to abolish the filibuster themselves if it served their purposes. \u201cBad faith is their catechism,\u201d Pitney says. \u201cDemocrats need to recognize what they\u2019re dealing with.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Thousands of progressive young people have expressed interest in running for office since the start of the year, demonstrating ongoing energy on the left after last year\u2019s elections. Run For Something, the PAC that supports young progressives running for state and local office, says 6,554 people signed up for its pipeline in January, many of whom indicated their interest to run in the wake of the insurrection at the US Capitol on January 6. The high interest comes on the heels of Democrats winning the White House and Senate, and maintaining their majority in the House. While signing up with Run For Something demonstrates a potential candidate\u2019s interest in running for office, it does not mean they will run in the next few years, nor does it guarantee the person will run at all. But the number of people who have signed up with Run For Something in the last month is far greater than anything the organization has seen before. Just 1,939 people signed up for the pipeline in January 2020. And of those who signed up for Run For Something this past January, more than 3,500 people said they\u2019d like to run within the next two years, according to the organization. \u201cWe need to win local office because it\u2019s not enough to win the House, Senate and White House,\u201d Amanda Litman, co-founder and executive director of Run For Something, said, adding that action taken at the national level will not impact regular people\u2019s lives fast enough. \u201cProgress happens locally,\u201d Litman said. Since its founding, Run For Something \u2013 which launched in 2017 as a response to President Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration \u2013 has recruited more than 70,000 potential candidates. Its pipeline provides potential candidates with tools and resources to start and sustain their political campaigns, including training sessions, conversations with Run For Something alumni, as well as a potential endorsement. In the past four years, the group has spent about $2 million a year supporting candidates. The group has supported 486 young people who have been elected local office across all 50 states and their elected candidates have been 56% Black and brown, 55% women, 21% LGBTQ and all under the age of 40. The group noted a number of factors that may be motivating young people to consider running for office in addition to the insurrection, including the coronavirus pandemic, the 2020 election and the nation grappling with racial justice. All shed light on the role that state and local elected officials play, the group says. Some of the young people who have signed up for Run For Something\u2019s pipeline in January told the organization they started to consider running after the death of George Floyd, the Black man in Minnesota who died after a White officer knelt on his neck last year, or because of a lack of Covid-19 relief in their communities. The insurrection at the US Capitol on January 6 also served as a call to action. On that day, Shayna Jaskolka, a 20-year-old student at University of Iowa, tweeted her interest in running for office. \u201cToday is the day I officially decided I want to run for office in the future. We can\u2019t have this happen again. Ever. We are no longer a world superpower. I want to bring back integrity to this place,\u201d she wrote at the time. Jaskolka has now officially signed up for the Run For Something pipeline. \u201cI sat there thinking about what happened and what was going on and what this meant, and I decided to tweet and make it official to say one day I will run for office to hold myself accountable,\u201d Jaskolka told CNN. She told CNN she plans to run for Congress in Iowa in 2026, as she will be just a month shy of being eligible to run for Congress in 2024. \u201cIn the meantime, I definitely think I might run for state House or state Senate,\u201d Jaskolka said. \u201cHopefully I\u2019ll end up being the youngest person elected into Congress,\u201d she added. For his part, Nicholas Cropper, a 24-year-old from Florida, said he decided to run for office after the insurrection because he was \u201cutterly appalled\u201d by his local representation in Sarasota, Florida. Cropper said his state senator, Joe Gruters \u2013 who cast an electoral vote for Donald Trump \u2013 posted on Facebook ahead of the January 6 Trump rally, saying that if people wanted to travel to DC for the rally, he had a friend going who would help organize travel. \u201cLearning that one of my state representatives had a hand in what happened at the Capitol on the 6th really got me thinking about where these people get their start. It\u2019s so clear to me that they get their start in city council on school boards or as state legislators,\u201d Cropper said. Cropper, a public health student at the University of South Florida, says he would like to run for office immediately, but recognizes he is still in school. \u201cI\u2019m eager to get on the trail and do this and be the candidate, but I understand that there\u2019s a lot to this that I haven\u2019t experienced yet,\u201d Cropper told CNN. \u201cThat\u2019s not to say I won\u2019t try this year for my local city council in Sarasota,\u201d Cropper said, adding that his real goal would be to run for state legislature. Meanwhile, Luis Vizcarrondo Jr., a 30-year-old minister in Cleveland, intends to run for city council in Cleveland this year. Vizcarrondo has considered running for a while, after experiencing racism and hearing of hatred toward the Latino community in the city, he says. \u201cBut the insurrection was the last straw for me,\u201d Vizcarrondo told CNN. \u201cAs a father of three kids, I would never have thought I would see a day like this.\u201d Vizcarrondo has a disabled daughter and an autistic daughter, and says he hopes to build a better world for them, as well as his 1-year-old son. \u201cI don\u2019t want them to live in a world where people are constantly bashing them and something needs to change.\u201d",

            "article_content": "A progressive Super PAC, MeidasTouch, is running an online video that claims Republican Florida Sen. Marco Rubio has refused to condemn the insurrection at the US Capitol. \u201cWhy won\u2019t Marco Rubio condemn the terrorist attack on the US Capitol? Because he is a co-conspirator,\u201d the video begins. The video goes on to say that Rubio applauded the convoy of Donald Trump supporters that was filmed surrounding a Joe Biden campaign bus on an interstate highway in Texas in October. (The FBI is investigating the highway incident.) The video suggests that Rubio\u2019s November comments in support of the harassment of the bus make him \u201cresponsible\u201d for the death and violence at the Capitol, more than two months later, since the Capitol insurrectionists \u201cheard the message, loud and clear.\u201d By Tuesday morning, the video had been viewed 1.1 million times on Twitter since it was posted last Thursday. But it is inaccurate. Facts First: It\u2019s not true that Rubio refuses to condemn the January attack on the Capitol. He has repeatedly denounced the insurrection, saying it was \u201cinexcusable,\u201d \u201cdisgusting,\u201d \u201cunpatriotic,\u201d and \u201canti-American anarchy.\u201d And while the video is reasonable in claiming Rubio endorsed the Trump supporters\u2019 hassling of the Biden campaign bus in Texas, there is no hard evidence as of Tuesday for the video\u2019s insinuation that Rubio\u2019s comments motivated the actions of insurrection participants. Rubio\u2019s comments about the bus incident The video\u2019s description of Rubio\u2019s comments about the bus incident is fair enough. Though Rubio spokesman Nick Iacovella argued Monday that it\u2019s clear in context that Rubio was applauding pro-Trump convoys and boat parades in general, not applauding harassment of campaign buses \u2013 Rubio opposes \u201cany violence\u201d or \u201cany aggressive tactic\u201d on behalf of any candidate, Iacovella said \u2013 we don\u2019t think Rubio actually made that clear at the time. He said: \u201cI saw yesterday a video of these people in Texas. Did you see it? All the cars on the road with the \u2013 we love what they did. But here\u2019s the thing they don\u2019t know: we do that in Florida every day. I love seeing the boat parades; you\u2019ve seen the boat parades. We thank all the great patriots in those boat parades on behalf of the President. But we want them to know: we\u2019ve been doing them for four years!\u201d The question of responsibility for the Capitol insurrection is complex; we can\u2019t definitively say whether Rubio\u2019s words had some role or not. But it\u2019s important to note that the FBI had not alleged in court documents as of Tuesday that this Rubio comment or any other Rubio comment was a motivating factor for any of the insurrectionists it had charged so far. And it\u2019s also worth noting that Trump, whose words allegedly did inspire the acts of some of the people in the mob, himself defended the Texas convoy in tweets to a giant audience. Meiselas told CNN in his email that there is an \u201cindisputable direct line\u201d between Rubio\u2019s words about the bus incident and \u201cthe conditions that led to the attack\u201d on the Capitol. This claim, about Rubio contributing to harmful political \u201cconditions,\u201d is a more nuanced and defensible claim than the suggestion in the video that insurrectionists heard and acted on Rubio\u2019s words. Rubio\u2019s comments about the insurrection MeidasTouch was founded last year by brothers Brett Meiselas, Ben Meiselas and Jordan Meiselas. A slogan featured on the Super PAC\u2019s Twitter account and website is \u201cBecause truth is golden.\u201d But Brett Meiselas defended the ad, including its inaccurate opening claim. He argued in an email to CNN on Monday that Rubio has offered merely \u201cperformative\u201d concern about the Capitol attack rather than a \u201ctrue\u201d condemnation. He said Rubio has demonstrated a lack of seriousness about the attack by opposing the impeachment of Trump, by turning from criticism of the attack to criticism of Democrats, and by drawing a false equivalence between the Capitol insurrection and summer racial justice protests (which were largely peaceful but involved some rioting). The video itself, however, doesn\u2019t offer this kind of nuanced criticism of the strength of Rubio\u2019s responses to the attack. Rather, the video starts by asking why Rubio won\u2019t condemn the insurrection at all. And that\u2019s just wrong. Rubio has issued condemnation after condemnation. While the insurrection was ongoing on January 6, Rubio tweeted, \u201cThere is nothing patriotic about what is occurring on Capitol Hill. This is 3rd world style anti-American anarchy.\u201d That night on Fox News, Rubio said to host Tucker Carlson that the insurrection was \u201ccompletely, a hundred percent inexcusable\u201d no matter what the participants\u2019 motivations. In another Fox News interview, with Maria Bartiromo on January 10, Rubio said of the insurrection: \u201cIt\u2019s disgusting. It\u2019s unpatriotic. It runs counter to everything we stand for.\u201d He said the participants were a \u201crogues\u2019 gallery,\u201d specifically calling out white supremacists, adherents of the QAnon conspiracy movement, and Proud Boys. In a Tampa Bay Times guest column for Martin Luther King Jr. Day, Rubio wrote, \u201cThe legacy of Martin Luther King, Jr. carries special meaning today as our nation wrestles with the unthinkable acts carried about by a violent, conspiratorial mob opposed to foundational elements of our democracy.\u201d Rubio\u2019s other criticism Rubio certainly left himself open to criticism for not speaking out more forcefully or frequently to reject Trump\u2019s lies about the election. While he did not join some of his Senate colleagues in objecting to Biden\u2019s electoral votes or join Trump in making baseless claims about mass fraud, he also offered a sympathetic, Democrat-bashing explanation for why some Americans believe these claims. On January 8, Rubio posted a video statement on Twitter that mixed criticism of the insurrection with criticism of others. He began: \u201cThe events that we saw this week should sicken every single one of us. Mob violence of the kind that you see in Third World countries happened not just in America, but in your Capitol building. I don\u2019t care what hat they wear, I don\u2019t care what banner they\u2019re carrying \u2013 riots should be rejected by everyone, every single time.\u201d He then switched gears. He criticized \u201cthe left,\u201d which he argued was hypocritical for condemning the insurrection after \u201cjustifying\u201d rioting during the summer. He argued that many Americans are convinced the election was unfair because of pro-Democratic bias among media outlets, social media companies and the state officials in charge of election laws. He claimed that, of the people who came to Washington, DC, to protest the election, \u201c99%\u201d had \u201cnothing to do with that mob\u201d at the Capitol. This is all questionable at best \u2013 and Rubio declined to explain in the video that the election was, in fact, entirely legitimate. Still, though, he indisputably condemned the insurrection the MeidasTouch video claims he did not condemn.",

            "article_content": "As Republicans search for a path forward following Donald Trump\u2019s defeat and the party\u2019s loss of power in Washington, many are looking across the Potomac River to Virginia, where voters will select a new governor this November. Well before the 2022 midterms or 2024 presidential primaries, the Virginia governor\u2019s race will be a first real test for a post-Trump GOP \u2013 not only of whether Republicans can start to win back a state they once reliably held, but in who the party picks as its nominee. With just three months before the state party\u2019s planned nominating convention, attention has fallen to Amanda Chase, a pro-Trump state senator who spoke at the \u201cStop the Steal\u201d rally in Washington on January 6. She later called those who stormed the Capitol \u201cpatriots\u201d and has insisted the 2020 election was stolen. Chase, who announced her candidacy for governor in February 2020, was censured last week by a bipartisan group of her senate colleagues after her subsequent comments were not deemed sufficiently conciliatory. In a phone interview with CNN Saturday evening, Chase called the censure a \u201cpolitically motivated hit job\u201d to hobble her campaign and filed a civil-rights complaint Monday in federal court to overturn it. More than anyone in Virginia, Chase is an avatar for the party\u2019s pro-Trump wing. \u201cMany of the grassroots have said to me, \u2018You\u2019re just like Trump, and we like President Trump,\u2019 \u201d Chase told CNN. Whether Virginia Republicans coalesce around Chase or flock to a less strident alternative will say a lot about where the power lies between the GOP\u2019s pro-Trump wing and what remains of its establishment. As it has in the past, Virginia\u2019s off-cycle governor\u2019s race could also provide an important indicator for upcoming midterm and presidential races, particularly in how suburban voters behave. \u201cVirginia was always the canary in the coal mine,\u201d said Jerry Kilgore, the former state attorney general and the GOP nominee for governor in 2005. \u201cWe were that state that signaled to the rest of the country what the midterms were going to be like.\u201d Recently, that signal hasn\u2019t been very strong for Republicans. The last time a GOP candidate won statewide in Virginia was in 2009, when Bob McDonnell was elected governor. Both Virginia\u2019s US senators, Democrats Tim Kaine and Mark Warner, had relatively easy reelection campaigns in 2018 and 2020. And since the 2019 election, both houses of the state legislature have been held by the Democrats. \u201cThe problem with the Republicans right now is they\u2019re in the post-Trump reality, and they haven\u2019t quite figured out what that means,\u201d said Chris Saxman, a former Republican state delegate who writes a political newsletter. \u201cThey don\u2019t know where they\u2019re going.\u201d There are pockets of pro-Trump sentiment, particularly in the rural parts of the state. Rep. Bob Good, a newly elected Republican congressman and Trump ally, defeated incumbent Denver Riggleman in the 2020 GOP primary by running to Riggleman\u2019s right. But in both 2016 and 2020, Trump carried just 44% of the vote in Virginia, a sign that the former President had a hard ceiling of support where previous Republican nominees did a few points better. So while Trumpism remains potent for some Virginia Republicans, others are hoping to move past the former President to regain their footing in the Old Dominion. Chase, however, says it\u2019s not time for Republicans to turn back the clock. \u201cThis is a new game. This is not the same political climate in the \u201980s and \u201890s. This is a very different world,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople, they don\u2019t trust the government. They don\u2019t trust the election results. They want to get a fighter in there.\u201d Despite Republicans\u2019 recent struggles, some see signs for optimism in Virginia. The top three Democratic office holders in the state have all faced some form of personal scandal in the past three years, including two sexual assault allegations against the current Lt. Gov. Justin Fairfax and Gov. Ralph Northam\u2019s blackface yearbook photo that surfaced in 2019. Fairfax has denied the allegations, while Northam first apologized for the photo and then later said he did not believe the person in blackface was him. The state has also drawn criticism for the job it\u2019s done administering Covid vaccines \u2013 at one point during January, according to CDC data, Virginia ranked the lowest in the nation in the percentage of its vaccine supply that had been administered, though that number has since improved. \u201cRepublicans have a great chance to win statewide this year,\u201d said Tucker Martin, a veteran GOP strategist in Richmond and a former spokesman for McDonnell. \u201cWhat we don\u2019t know now is what Trump has done to the environment. Has he permanently hurt the brand here or can Republicans get a fair shot to introduce themselves to voters again without his baggage hanging around?\u201d A strong showing for the Virginia GOP in 2021 depends in large part on whether the party\u2019s association with Trump will remain a barrier to entry for independent voters. That will likely show up most in suburban and exurban areas Richmond, Hampton Roads, and Northern Virginia \u2013 all places where Democrats have started winning regularly in state and federal elections. \u201cRepublicans have a lot of work to do. They have to be able to reach the suburbs with a message that\u2019s a winning message. They haven\u2019t been able to do that in several years now,\u201d said Kilgore. \u201cThose issues have to be issues that are based on the suburb\u2019s issues, which would be education, public safety, dealing with Covid.\u201d The Virginia Republican Party plans to hold its nominating convention on May 1, though it\u2019s not settled whether that will be virtual or in-person. Democrats will hold a traditional primary election five weeks later on June 8. Many Republicans around the state are concerned that nominating Chase could derail the party\u2019s rebranding effort and instead double-down on the Trump-like politics that have hurt the GOP in the suburbs. Some of them worry that\u2019s the path Republicans are currently on. \u201cRight now she\u2019s the leader, because she\u2019s the leader in name ID,\u201d said Saxman of Chase. \u201cPeople like the fact that she fights.\u201d Chase was buoyant and confident Saturday night as she drove home from a gun show in Fisherville, in Virginia\u2019s Shenandoah Valley. Speaking to CNN on the phone from a car full of campaign volunteers, she said the Second Amendment is an energizing issue for Republicans \u2013 and particularly, for her campaign. \u201cPeople were just, like, cheering,\u201d said Chase, who gave a speech at the gun show. \u201cI think we are reenergizing the Republican Party.\u201d She revels in being known as a \u201cfirebrand\u201d and \u201cpolitically incorrect,\u201d while also decrying what she calls a \u201cgood-ol\u2019-boy network\u201d of Republican lawmakers in Richmond. Chase was expelled from the Chesterfield County Republican committee in 2019 for supporting the opponent of the Republican sheriff, and two months later announced she would no longer be caucusing with the GOP in the state Senate. \u201cI\u2019m an educated professional woman who doesn\u2019t take crap off of these Republican men who have dominated the Republican Party for decades,\u201d she said told CNN. Chase argued she\u2019s best equipped to bring in new voters to the Republican Party, including Democrats angry about their own party\u2019s leftward turn on issues like guns and taking down Confederate monuments. \u201cDemocrats are leaving the Democratic party because the Democratic party are taking down their statues, their history,\u201d she said. And contra the conventional wisdom that suburban women hold more socially liberal views on both gun control and issues of racial equity, Chase says she\u2019s unique among Republicans because of her gender. \u201cWhile I\u2019m not into identity politics, I am the first female to ever run and seek the Republican nomination ever,\u201d she told CNN. \u201cI think that\u2019s going to really bring in a lot of the suburban moms.\u201d Others argue her extreme style \u2013 Chase told CNN pandemic-related restrictions have made Virginia like \u201ca communist country\u201d \u2013 are exactly what turns off swing voters in Northern Virginia and other suburbs. \u201cShe\u2019s not the right person to lead the party,\u201d said Kilgore. \u201cShe\u2019s bombastic at times. She says things that shouldn\u2019t be said. She leads us in the wrong direction.\u201d But to Chase, that\u2019s exactly why she\u2019s going to win the GOP nomination. \u201cThey like it. They like that I\u2019m bombastic,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019m a sassy suburbanite.\u201d Kirk Cox, a member of the House of Delegates for more than three decades and its speaker from 2018 to 2020, told CNN he won\u2019t win the nomination by \u201ctrashing\u201d his opponents and instead insisted he\u2019s focused on his legislative experience delivering on Republican goals. Pete Snyder, who launched his campaign last week, said he was \u201cvery comfortable\u201d in his lane as a conservative businessman and outsider. (A spokesman for another Republican candidate, Glenn Youngkin, did not respond to requests for comment for this story.) The hope from Republicans opposed to Chase is that she will have little support outside her core base \u2013 and that the convention\u2019s balloting process means an alternative with broader support is likely to emerge. \u201cThere are so many people who are anti-Chase. There is a very dedicated, core, pro-Chase element of the party, but she doesn\u2019t pick up anybody on the second ballot,\u201d said one Virginia Republican. Saxman, however, says conventions can be unpredictable and that Chase has captured the hearts of the party faithful. \u201cShe\u2019s engaging with them. She\u2019s fighting with them,\u201d he said. At the moment, the best way Republicans feel they can win back the suburbs and with them, Virginia, is to focus on reopening public schools to in-student learning. Chase says she wants every school in the state to provide full-time, in-school instruction. Snyder says he is in regular contact with the various parent-driven \u201cOpen\u201d movements in school districts across the state, and the issue was front-and-center in the video he released announcing his campaign. \u201cMy campaign is focused on opening up schools,\u201d he told CNN. Cox, a retired public-school teacher, pointed out he had been criticizing since last summer what he calls a lack of leadership from Northam and Virginia Democrats on responsible school reopenings. Saxman says that there is a big opportunity for the GOP if it can get out of its own way. He noted that the front page of a recent issue of the Richmond Times-Dispatch featured an article about Northam\u2019s efforts to catch Virginia up after weeks of ranking near the bottom among states for vaccine distribution \u2013 the sort of story Republicans might want to exploit. The problem? The lead story at the top of the Times-Dispatch about the Virginia GOP\u2019s most visible member: \u201cVirginia Senate censures Chase.\u201d",

In effect, the President is putting a date on a return of a semblance of normal life \u2013 with no guarantee that he can deliver. If the President succeeds, Tuesday may be remembered as a key turning point in a pandemic exacerbated by the former Trump administration\u2019s disastrous response. Should he fall short, the credibility of his new presidency will take a serious hit, that would not only prolong the crisis into another fall and winter but would also hamper his ambitious program on other key issues.   In a show of presidential power six days into his term, Biden sought to galvanize the action of federal, state and local governments into the kind of unified, national effort that had up until now been lacking during this once-in-century crisis. \u201cTo a nation waiting for action, let me be clearest on this point: Help is on the way,\u201d Biden said Tuesday, after announcing the purchase of another 200 million vaccine doses and a hike in distribution to states within days. In some ways, Biden\u2019s pledge included some political sleight of hand, since it will not get vaccine supply anywhere near levels demanded by the states in the short-term and he admitted deaths could hit half a million next month. Tuesday\u2019s announcement was both administrative and political. It offered a rare morale boost after nearly a year of lockdowns, social distancing, separated families and sickness and death, especially coming in the darkest days of one of the grimmest winters in years. \u201cLet\u2019s say we are able to get 300 million people vaccinated by the summer, life changes dramatically and we get out of this situation we are living in where the pandemic dominates our lives,\u201d Dr. Ashish Jha, dean of the Brown University School of Public Health, said on CNN\u2019s \u201cThe Situation Room.\u201d Signs that there is finally a federal government that is not in denial and has a coherent plan could give businesses, from cruise lines to restaurants, the capacity to plan ahead \u2013 a crucial factor in the recovery of the economy from its pandemic stasis. And Biden\u2019s aggressive, daily, actions designed to combat the pandemic since taking office may also inject a sense of urgency on Capitol Hill as Republicans question the need for a rescue package that is vital to speeding up vaccinations. On Wednesday, Andy Slavitt, senior adviser to the White House Covid-19 response team, said it will be \u201cmonths before everyone who wants a vaccine will be able to get one.\u201d The White House is, however, currently on pace to meet its vaccination goal of 100 million vaccines in Biden\u2019s first 100 days, Slavitt said, adding that \u201cany (vaccine) stockpile that may have existed no longer exists.\u201d Biden\u2019s White House appearance was the latest in a series of choreographed events in recent days on issues from racial equity, climate change and the economy designed to show a new president, in charge and gaining momentum. The planned string of announcements is clearly designed to signal a sharp break from the chaos and tweeted incoherence of the last administration. In other encouraging news on Tuesday, a new US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention study added to the growing evidence that in-person schooling is low risk, as long as the right mitigation measures, including masking, are observed. School closures have not only severely hampered the education of a generation of kids. They have complicated the lives of parents who struggle to work if they can\u2019t access childcare. But the prospect of a return to class worries teachers unions \u2013 a strong force in the Democratic Party \u2013 amid concerns that especially older school staff are vulnerable to complications from the virus. Signs of frenetic activity in the West Wing are already cheering governors used to inaccurate data and guidance from the Trump administration and who are pleading for more vaccine doses. Biden announces purchase of 200M vaccine doses \u201cYou have a competent, professional, federal government that tells the truth,\u201d New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, who admittedly is, like Biden, a Democrat, told CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer. Governors were particularly pleased to hear White House coronavirus coordinator Jeffrey Zients say they will now get three weeks\u2019 advance notice of how much vaccine will be available, allowing them time to plan and staff up for inoculation drives. The lack of such a timeframe helps explains why millions of already distributed vaccines were not immediately offered to patients in recent weeks. Zients also said that distribution to the states will increase by 16% by next week. It will become clear whether those calculations are accurate within days. And of course, even with a 16% increase, vaccine distribution will fall massively short of the number states need to make a dent in the crisis anytime soon. There has so far been no comment on Biden\u2019s announcement of the purchase of 200 million more doses by Pfizer-BioNTech or Moderna, the two firms confirmed that have received emergency authorization for their vaccines. Biden\u2019s announcement on Tuesday also represented some political triage, given some messy and sometimes conflicting messaging about targets and vaccine supply in recent days by the President and his staff. While professing optimism on Tuesday, Biden was careful to temper expectations, warning: \u201cWe didn\u2019t get into this mess overnight and it\u2019s going to take months for us to turn things around.\u201d His comments reflected the political hazard inherent in setting timelines and making predictions about a pernicious and unpredictable pandemic, especially in the middle of a race between the mass deployment of vaccines and mutations of the virus that could challenge their effectiveness. And Biden\u2019s pledge, that follows criticism that his promise of 100 million administrated vaccine doses in his first 100 days was insufficiently ambitious, is also dependent on many other factors beyond his direct control. Experience has shown that having vaccine available does not mean it is being administered. The White House, however, argues that its aggressive strategy is a huge improvement on the Trump team\u2019s more hands-off approach that left the states to fix issues on their own. There may also be manufacturing glitches, potential supply and transport problems, and logistical issues in the states that could compromise the White House\u2019s timeline, which could come back to haunt the President. Then there is the issue of whether a sufficient proportion of Americans will get vaccinated for the country to approach herd immunity, the point at which it becomes difficult for the virus to spread. An Axios-Ipsos poll published on Tuesday showed that 49% of those asked intended to get the inoculation as soon as possible. Such data has led some top health experts in recent days to question whether at some point the key problem will not be a shortage of vaccines but a deficit of willing recipients. \u201cDay Seven: we have found a way to secure vaccine supply adequate to provide a dose for EVERY adult by summer,\u201d White House Chief of Staff Ron Klain tweeted on Tuesday. \u201cBUT that still leaves getting them all vaccinated \u2013 building the infrastructure, ending the hesitancy \u2013 as challenges.\u201d Those challenges recall the previous capacity of the virus to outrace local and federal government responses. Who could forget for instance Trump\u2019s vow that the pews would be full in churches by last Easter? The new administration\u2019s plans do seem on firmer ground and rooted in science. Trump\u2019s pronouncements were based on wishful thinking, poor information and politically self-serving statements. To back up the President\u2019s promise to deploy science and not to hide bad news, the CDC and other experts are due to relaunch briefings at the White House on Wednesday. There are also longer-term challenges. Despite the President\u2019s daily admonitions that mask wearing could save tens of thousands of lives, the practice remains highly politicized, in a nation where a many conservatives believe conspiracy theories that he stole the election. New Covid-19 mutations, including those first discovered in the United Kingdom and South Africa, threaten to reverse current and encouraging signs that the latest wave of the pandemic has peaked across the nation, with new infections and hospitalizations still highly elevated, but falling. Should numbers of cases continue to fall, governors \u2013 especially those in Republican-run states \u2013 may prematurely reopen businesses at normal levels and trigger new waves of disease before Biden\u2019s virus gambit fully delivers.",

Jeff Jackson announced his 2022 bid for Senate on Tuesday, setting up a divisive Democratic primary for the open seat that will be pivotal to the party\u2019s future control of the Senate. Jackson launched his \u201c100-county campaign\u201d in a video with his wife Marisa and his young sons, who are seen packing their bags in preparation for the months-long contest. He talked about a \u201cNorth Carolina agenda\u201d that addresses the pandemic, the unemployed, the opioid crisis, a lack of rural broadband and housing, health care and criminal justice racial disparities. Jackson also nodded to the state\u2019s 2020 election, in which Cal Cunningham, a former state senator and military veteran, lost his race against Republican Sen. Thom Tillis by less than two points after his sex scandal. \u201cWe cannot go through another election like the one we just had,\u201d Marisa said. \u201cThat was miserable,\u201d added Jackson, as one of his kids piles toys into a suitcase. \u201cYou deserve better.\u201d Jackson is a 38-year-old former prosecutor, and a captain in the Army National Guard who served in Afghanistan. Republicans and a Democratic opponent, former state senator Erica Smith, have already tried to label him an echo of Cunningham. Smith, a Black woman who lost to Cunningham in the last Senate Democratic primary, tweeted on Tuesday, \u201cWe cannot continue to go back to the SAME playbook & expect different results.\u201d \u201cIt is time for a new kind of politics & a new kind of leadership. Together, we can bring about the change we need,\u201d she said, adding the hashtags \u201cWinWithBlackWomen\u201d and \u201cEmbraceTheBase.\u201d In 2019, Jackson flew to meet with Senate Democratic Leader Chuck Schumer, and pitched a grassroots campaign for Senate, including \u201c100 town halls in 100 days,\u201d according to a recording of a talk Jackson gave at the University of North Carolina at Charlotte obtained by National Review. Jackson said he was told he would instead have to spend months in a \u201cwindowless basement raising money\u201d to buy attack ads against Tillis. Jackson\u2019s announcement video showed he still plans on an in-person campaign strategy. But GOP Senate candidate Mark Walker, a former congressman, referred to that article on Tuesday, sarcastically congratulating Jackson for \u201cdeciding the \u2018windowless basement\u2019 Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer wanted him in for 2020 is now appealing for 2022.\u201d Many candidates are expected to run for the seat left open by Republican Sen. Richard Burr\u2019s coming retirement. Among others, Lara Trump, a North Carolina native and the President\u2019s daughter-in-law, is reportedly considering a Senate campaign.",

            "article_content": "Former President Donald Trump flouted the limits of presidential power unlike any of his recent predecessors, leaving behind a legacy of unmatched abuses that range from violations of longstanding norms to potentially criminal behavior. It was hard to keep track amid the daily deluge of controversial tweets and distractions that were a hallmark of the Trump presidency. And some of the most egregious abuses of power weren\u2019t clear at the time but came into focus after exhaustive investigations. To chronicle Trump\u2019s most consequential abuses of power, CNN spoke with a politically diverse group of constitutional scholars, presidential historians and experts on democratic institutions. While these 16 experts did not agree on everything, there was consensus that Trump\u2019s pattern of abusing his powers for personal or political gain reached an alarming level that hasn\u2019t been seen in modern history, and will have long-lasting consequences for the future of American democracy. Here is a breakdown of Trump\u2019s 10 most significant abuses of power. There is broad agreement among experts that Trump\u2019s most severe abuse of power was his relentless effort to undermine the 2020 election and overturn the legitimate results. Michael Paulsen, a conservative legal scholar and professor at the University of St. Thomas, in Minnesota, called it a \u201cform of a political coup d\u2019\u00e9tat against our Constitution.\u201d Throughout the 2020 campaign, Trump spread provably false disinformation about the voting process. He even floated the idea of unconstitutionally delaying the election, leading to a bipartisan rebuke. After Trump lost, he falsely claimed victory and pressured election officials in battleground states to fraudulently throw out millions of votes for President Joe Biden. The most memorable example was Trump\u2019s hour-long call with Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, when he harangued the GOP official to \u201cfind\u201d just enough votes to nullify Biden\u2019s narrow victory in that state. Trump\u2019s legal team filed dozens of meritless lawsuits alleging fraud, which were rejected by a bipartisan array of federal and state judges, and the Supreme Court. When these efforts failed, Trump unsuccessfully tried to coerce then-Vice President Mike Pence to unlawfully override the Electoral College process and block Biden\u2019s victory in Congress.   \u201cNothing remotely compares to this,\u201d said Akhil Amar of Yale Law School, who is among the most-cited constitutional scholars in the country. \u201cHis actions since the election have threatened the very existence of our constitutional democracy. This looms large in the history of not just this administration, but the history of America. This is what history will remember most harshly.\u201d Along the way, the Trump administration dragged its feet on the formal transition of power, which was delayed for weeks while Trump refused to acknowledge defeat. Biden said his team was met with \u201cobstruction\u201d from Trump appointees at the Pentagon and White House. Trump\u2019s efforts to undermine the transition are unprecedented in modern American history, the experts said. \u201cTrump has put more pressure on the integrity of the election process than any individual in modern American history. There has never been anything on this scale,\u201d said Rick Hasen, a former CNN analyst and election law expert who teaches at the University of California, Irvine. Trump\u2019s attempts to cling to power reached a horrifying crescendo on January 6, when he incited a large gathering of supporters in Washington to attack the US Capitol while the electoral votes were being counted. \u201cThis in and of itself puts Trump in the lowest circle of hell among America\u2019s presidents, along with the likes of James Buchanan and Andrew Johnson,\u201d Amar said. At a rally before the attack, Trump urged supporters to march to the Capitol and \u201cfight like hell,\u201d telling them, \u201cYou\u2019ll never take back our country with weakness, you have to show strength.\u201d The protests quickly transformed into a violent mob, which overran police barriers and stormed the building. The occupation was quelled after several hours of violent clashes, which led to five deaths. \u201cIt is not far-fetched to argue that he should have anticipated that his false election claims and incitement to march on the Capitol to \u2018stop the steal\u2019 would have devastating consequences,\u201d said Ross Garber, a Tulane Law School professor who previously defended four Republican governors that faced impeachment.   Figures from both parties labeled the attack an insurrection and blamed Trump for the violence, which killed one police officer and four rioters. No US president, with the possible exception of Andrew Johnson, has ever fomented a violent uprising against lawmakers, though Trump denies responsibility. The incident led to Trump\u2019s second impeachment by the House, in the most bipartisan impeachment vote in US history, for \u201cincitement of insurrection.\u201d The Senate is expected to begin Trump\u2019s trial on February 9. \u201cThe founders intended that the office of the president be held by people with sufficient virtue,\u201d said Franita Tolson, a constitutional law professor at the University of Southern California. \u201cThey recognized the risk of someone who is a tyrant abusing the office, but they didn\u2019t build a system to prevent it. The question is, will we learn from this, and alter our Constitution to prevent this from happening again?\u201d Many of the experts pointed to Trump\u2019s inflammatory and divisive rhetoric as a stark abuse of power, albeit not criminal, and probably not impeachable either. But they said Trump abused the bully pulpit by using his platform to brazenly spread lies and conspiracies, attack political opponents of all stripes, and praise bad actors like white nationalists and authoritarian leaders. CNN and other news outlets fact-checked thousands of lies that Trump told during his tenure, far surpassing the cherry-picked political spin or occasional whoppers told by past presidents. \u201cTrump abused the bully pulpit to intimidate witnesses, literally bully people and spread disinformation. It\u2019s never been done on the scale that he did it,\u201d said Michael Gerhardt, a law professor at the University of North Carolina who testified as a Democratic witness in favor of impeachment in 2019   Many of Trump\u2019s comments debased the public discourse and were blatantly racist or fanned the flames of existing divisions. Others were detrimental to public health. Last year, he often downplayed the risks of Covid-19 and promoted unproven treatments. The experts said these were shameful misuses of his bully pulpit that literally put Americans in danger. Larry Diamond, an expert on democratic governance at the Hoover Institution, said Trump \u201chas massive responsibility for creating the normative atmosphere in which extremism, hatred, racial bigotry and violent imagery have prospered and metastasized.\u201d Diamond noted Trump\u2019s refusal to condemn white supremacists at the 2017 Charlottesville rally to his praising of QAnon in late 2020. \u201cThe amount of lies that came out of this presidency was corrosive to our political culture,\u201d said Joe Goldman, president of the Democracy Fund, a nonpartisan foundation that studies voter attitudes toward democratic institutions and works to strengthen democracy. \u201cIn theory, you could pass new laws to address many of the norm violations we saw under Trump. But earning back people\u2019s trust is much harder to do.\u201d Trump politicized the Justice Department and FBI from the very start of his presidency until the final days. He repeatedly crossed lines and violated norms that have been in place since Watergate to create independence between the White House and federal law enforcement. \u201cIt\u2019s extremely important for the integrity of American democracy that the president cannot manipulate law enforcement for partisan, political, self-interested preferences,\u201d said Rick Pildes, a former CNN legal analyst who teaches at New York University. \u201cTrump constantly agitated to eliminate the boundaries between a President and the DOJ, which was incredibly disturbing.\u201d The experts ranked this among Trump\u2019s worst abuses because his goal was often to twist the Justice Department to serve his own needs \u2013 not the national interest. A clear pattern emerged where Trump leaned on law enforcement to protect him and his allies, and to harass his critics. This created a tense atmosphere with some resignations and public rebukes.   During his four years, Trump publicly urged the FBI to investigate more than two dozen of his perceived opponents, including several Democratic lawmakers, some of the prosecutors and FBI officials involved in the Russia investigation, Biden\u2019s son Hunter Biden, the tech company Google, and even the author of the infamous 2018 \u201canonymous\u201d op-ed in The New York Times. While most of these abuses were rhetorical in nature, he took some overt actions that triggered scrutiny from criminal investigators, like his 2017 firing of then-FBI Director James Comey, which led to the appointment of special counsel Robert Mueller to investigate Russian meddling in the 2016 election. \u201cBy politicizing (the Justice Department) now, and frankly by engaging in a lot of conduct that appears to be illegal, President Trump undermined the ability of the department to proceed in a clear way going forward,\u201d said Lisa Manheim, a University of Washington law professor who specializes in constitutional issues and co-wrote a 2018 book about the limits of presidential power. The Mueller investigation dominated the first three years of Trump\u2019s presidency. Angry over an investigation that he felt was illegitimate, Trump repeatedly lashed out at Mueller and took steps to undermine and obstruct the sprawling criminal probe. Mueller investigated 10 episodes and found persuasive evidence that Trump\u2019s actions fit the legal criteria to warrant criminal charges. But Mueller decided not to make an up-or-down decision on whether to charge Trump, citing Justice Department rules against indicting a sitting president and the difficult constitutional questions that would make for a challenging prosecution. Instead, Mueller famously said, \u201cIf we had had confidence that the President clearly did not commit a crime, we would have said so.\u201d Mueller\u2019s cryptic refusal to clear Trump\u2019s name was quickly washed away by Trump\u2019s often-repeated lie that Mueller gave him \u201ctotal and complete exoneration,\u201d a false claim he and his allies parroted dozens of times.   \u201cThe offenses in the Mueller report make a powerful and overwhelming case for obstruction of justice and political corruption,\u201d said Paulsen, the conservative legal scholar. \u201cTo some extent, it was criminal. To some extent, it was non-criminal corruption. Mueller couldn\u2019t get to the full scope because of the obstruction.\u201d The experts had mixed views on Trump\u2019s possible criminal exposure. Some said there was strong proof that Trump broke the law, while others said some of the alleged episodes of obstruction would be difficult to prosecute. Michael Zeldin, a former CNN legal analyst who previously worked for Mueller at the Justice Department, said there were one or two incidents that were strong and prosecutable obstruction crimes, including when Trump ordered his White House counsel to write a memo falsely stating that Trump never ordered him to fire Mueller. \u201cIn my view, that is a clear act of obstruction,\u201d Zeldin said. \u201cThe sole intention was to interfere with the investigation. There is no other explanation for it.\u201d The Constitution places almost no limits on presidential commutations and pardons for federal crimes, and many past presidents have granted controversial pardons, especially in their final weeks in office. But the experts agreed that Trump took this phenomenon to new extremes. \u201cI thought Bill Clinton abused the pardon power at the end of his term. But what we\u2019re seeing from Trump makes Clinton look trivial in comparison,\u201d said Diamond, from the Hoover Institution, referring to Clinton\u2019s controversial pardons to associates and allies on his last day in office. Trump eschewed the regular process and almost never consulted with the Justice Department\u2019s clemency office, leading to some highly controversial pardons. Some of the experts said that while allowable, these pardons undercut anti-corruption efforts and undermined the rule of law.   Mueller found some evidence that Trump obstructed justice by publicly urging ex-aides not to cooperate and dangling pardons in exchange for loyalty. Trump closed the loop in December 2020 by pardoning former aides Roger Stone, Paul Manafort, Michael Flynn and George Papadopoulos, who were convicted of lying or obstructing the Mueller probe, among other crimes. \u201cHe used the pardon as a tool to entrench himself in power and to subvert the legal system,\u201d said Manheim, the constitutional specialist at the University of Washington School of Law. In one of his final acts in office, Trump pardoned his former strategist Steve Bannon, who was charged in 2020 with defrauding Trump supporters in a \u201cbuild the wall\u201d scheme. The pardon was especially controversial, given Bannon\u2019s violent rhetoric and ties to \u201cstop the steal\u201d groups that attacked the Capitol. Trump also pardoned prominent Republicans who were early boosters of his 2016 campaign, and used footage of a pardon ceremony for political purposes at the 2020 Republican National Convention. He never followed through, but Trump openly mused about pardoning himself, claiming multiple times that he could if he wanted to, even though that claim is untested and legally dubious. \u201cI think the president\u2019s pardon power is essentially unlimited. I even think he can pardon himself for past crimes,\u201d Paulsen said. \u201cNonetheless, to abuse the pardon power like Trump has, while not unconstitutional, it is surely impeachable and deserves condemnation.\u201d Trump is one of three presidents to get impeached, a fate he first faced in 2019 after pressuring the Ukrainian government to help his reelection campaign by announcing a baseless investigation into the Bidens. As part of the scheme, Trump unlawfully withheld nearly $400 million in much-needed military aid from Ukraine, even though Congress appropriated the funds with bipartisan support. \u201cThis clearly looked like an extremely inappropriate quid-pro-quo offer,\u201d said Susan Rose-Ackerman, a law professor at Yale University who has written books about political corruption.   The Trump White House told government officials and agencies not to cooperate with the Democratic-run House impeachment inquiry, and many officials defied subpoenas for testimony or documents. Yet, other Trump administration officials from the National Security Council, State Department, and Pentagon testified under oath and implicated Trump. \u201cThere has always been tension between the President and Congress over investigations of the White House,\u201d said Pildes, the legal expert from New York University. \u201cBut we never had a president who stonewalled Congress and made it this difficult for Congress to perform one of its most important functions \u2013 oversight of the White House.\u201d Trump\u2019s impeachment was a heated partisan affair: The House impeached Trump with only Democratic votes, and just one Senate Republican voted to convict Trump, who was acquitted on both articles. Many of the experts said Trump\u2019s dealings with Ukraine were wholly inappropriate for a sitting president. There is debate over whether his actions were impeachable \u2013 or separately, maybe even part of a criminal conspiracy. But there is strong consensus that he inappropriately used the powers of his office to benefit his reelection campaign, and that his blanket stonewalling of Congress was improper. \u201cSeeking a foreign nation\u2019s help to prosecute a US citizen, that\u2019s an exercise of the president\u2019s foreign relations power,\u201d said Paulsen, the conservative legal scholar. \u201cThe problem is the misuse of that power for personal political gain, and it\u2019s clear that\u2019s what Trump did. That is impeachable, and this is the big one that got away.\u201d A recurring theme of the Trump presidency was the personalization of government, with Trump regularly conflating his interests with the national interests, and demanding personal loyalty from nearly everyone around him in government. \u201cTrump\u2019s demand that government actors pledge loyalty to him, as opposed to the law or to the constitution, is a corruption of the rule of law, and it\u2019s a corruption of government institutions,\u201d Pildes said. This pattern first came into focus when Comey revealed to the public that Trump demanded \u201cloyalty\u201d from him during a private meeting in early 2017 \u2013 an inappropriate request from any sitting President to an FBI chief. As the years went on, it became clear that Cabinet members and top officials could only survive if they put on a show for Trump, showering him with praise and platitudes.   \u201cUnder Donald Trump, it was almost impossible to tell who was purportedly working on behalf of the government and who was working for Trump personally. That has significant consequences,\u201d said Garber, the impeachment expert, referring to Trump\u2019s legal team during his 2019 impeachment. This is an abuse of power, the experts said, because it subverts the loyalty that Trump and his aides are supposed to swear to the constitution, and usurps it with personal loyalty to one man\u2019s whims. \u201cTo the extent that a president tries to use his own authority to pressure executive branch officials to be loyal to him rather than to the law, that undermines on a fundamental level the governmental level the structure that we\u2019ve set up,\u201d Manheim said. The experts pointed out that there were trickle-down effects from Trump\u2019s behavior. Many White House aides were flagged for violating the Hatch Act, the toothless federal law that prohibits executive branch officials from using their jobs for political purposes. In a brazen flouting of the spirit of this law, Trump delivered his 2020 GOP convention speech from the White House lawn, which had never been done before. \u201cWe only have a limited window into how much he tried to bully, manipulate, distort and threaten officials who were just doing their constitutional duty,\u201d said Nancy Gibbs, a presidential historian and former editor in chief of Time Magazine who now runs Harvard University\u2019s political research shop. As someone who demanded absolute loyalty, Trump didn\u2019t react well when officials disagreed with him, either publicly or privately. Officials often lost their jobs if Trump felt like they weren\u2019t doing his bidding, or if they contradicted him in public, even to stand up for the truth. There were firings, forced resignations and premature departures, which ramped up in Trump\u2019s final year. The experts agreed Trump had the authority to take these actions, but they said he crossed a line by clearly retaliating against officials for personal reasons without good cause. \u201cI have a strong view of presidential power,\u201d Paulsen said. \u201cThese are actions that are within the president\u2019s constitutional powers. But it\u2019s still an abuse to use those powers for corrupt personal purposes.\u201d Some of the most egregious examples stemmed from Trump\u2019s impeachment. After his acquittal, he purged several officials who testified against him, like US Ambassador to the European Union Gordon Sondland as well as Lt. Col Alexander Vindman from the National Security Council.   \u201cThe President can fire an ambassador, but Trump fired Gordon Sondland because Sondland was a whistleblower against him \u2013 and that\u2019s an abuse of power. If you punish someone for exercising their rights, you are violating those rights,\u201d said Gerhardt, who testified in favor of impeachment in 2019. Trump also removed inspectors general that uncovered wrongdoing by his administration, and fired Chris Krebs, the top election security official who publicly debunked his voter fraud conspiracies. He also relentlessly attacked whistleblowers who spoke out against him, including the anonymous intelligence official whose complaint triggered his impeachment, as well as Dr. Rick Bright, the former public health official who publicly criticized Trump\u2019s failed pandemic response in early 2020. \u201cThere has been real damage to expertise across the government. The civil servants have to be able to speak honestly without fear of being fired unless they\u2019ve done something wrong,\u201d said Kim Scheppele, a professor at Princeton University whose research focuses on the collapse of constitutional governments. \u201cWhy would anyone want to go into the public sector anymore?\u201d Trump was the first billionaire to ascend to the presidency. When he took the mantle in 2017, he defied the near-universal advice from ethics specialists and refused to divest from his international business empire. Instead, Trump temporarily turned over control of his company to his adult sons, which he said his lawyers cleared from a conflict-of-interest standpoint. The biggest issue, the experts said, was the appearance of a massive conflict of interest. \u201cIt is reflective of his own moral compass. It is showing the way in which he thinks about his role as president,\u201d said Rose-Ackerman, the Yale professor who studies political corruption. \u201cIt isn\u2019t tied so much to a million dollars here or a million dollars there. It\u2019s tied to his perspective about what it means to be president \u2013 that he sees it as giving him free range to do things.\u201d Trump spent considerable time at his own properties and golf clubs, substantially raising their profile, and even making money from the federal government along the way. Trump\u2019s company billed the US government millions of dollars, including for Secret Service agents to stay at his properties while protecting him. His high-end hotel in Washington, DC, became a mainstay for GOP insiders and lobbyists, and even some foreign officials, who were accused of buying influence by booking rooms. (The Trump Organization said it voluntary donated all profits from foreign governments to the United States Treasury.)   \u201cWe\u2019ve depended on a combination of legal requirements and norms to prevent conflicts of interest and self-dealing,\u201d said Deborah Hellman, a University of Virginia law professor who studies political corruption. \u201cOnce norms get broken, it\u2019s hard to put them back together again.\u201d Some of the experts said there are serious questions about Trump\u2019s potential violations of the Emoluments Clause of the US Constitution, which bans federal officials from taking payments from foreign governments. DC-area businesses, as well as Democratic lawmakers and attorneys general, tried to go after Trump in the courts, but progress has been slow. This was yet another situation where Trump skirted norms and benefited from the fact that the laws on the books aren\u2019t really designed to deal with a president with his own global business. \u201cWhat Trump figured out \u2013 the autocrats that I study, like Orban in Hungry, Erdogan in Turkey and Bolsonaro in Brazil, they all do this \u2013 they operate in this space where no law actually prohibits, but soft norms govern. And because there is no law, it\u2019s hard to hold them to account. That\u2019s how democracies collapse,\u201d said Scheppele, the Princeton expert on failed governments.

            "article_content": "Human rights lawyer Tara Murray had hopes of somehow witnessing Kamala Harris\u2019 vice-presidential oath in person. But a raging pandemic and the January 6 violent siege on the US Capitol by a pro-Trump mob got in her way. So on Wednesday, Murray \u2013 the founder of a pro-Harris group, Mamas for Momala \u2013 celebrated the inauguration just as she had volunteered during the course of the campaign: remotely. She pulled on a sweater representing the Alpha Kappa Alpha sorority that she and Harris share, ate a special lunch of her mother\u2019s gumbo and joined her fellow \u201cMamas\u201d for a Facebook watch party. All around the country this week, Black women followed suit \u2013 dressing up, toasting and exulting at home and online as the former US senator and California attorney general walked into history. \u201cI\u2019m not going to allow the plans and the plots of these White supremacist terrorists to interfere with the joy that I have,\u201d the 39-year-old Murray said from her home in the Northern Virginia suburbs of Washington. \u201cThis moment belongs to all of us who worked so hard.\u201d In office, Harris \u201cwill stand as one, but she will bring 10,000,\u201d said Glynda Carr, the president and CEO of Higher Heights for America, paraphrasing the late poet Maya Angelou. \u201cShe\u2019s a woman. She\u2019s a woman of color. She\u2019s a Black woman, a daughter of immigrants. She belongs to a historically Black Greek Letter organization. She went to a historically Black college.\u201d \u201cAs she governs, she brings those voices with her,\u201d said Carr, whose organization focuses on building Black women\u2019s political power. Black women were crucial to the Biden-Harris victory, with 90% backing the ticket in November, CNN exit polls show. And in Georgia, a state that went blue in the presidential contest for the first time since 1992, Black women supported Democrats Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff by even wider margins \u2013 elevating them to the Senate in this month\u2019s runoffs and giving their party control of the chamber. Black women \u201cshow up consistently for this country,\u201d said LaTosha Brown, co-founder of Black Voters Matter Fund, which mobilized voters in Georgia and in key battlegrounds to help secure Joe Biden\u2019s victory. She also helped lead a high-profile campaign last summer by Black female activists to push Biden to add an African American woman to the ticket. In lobbying then-candidate Biden, \u201cI made a promise that, literally, if you select a Black woman vice president, Black women are going to deliver it to you,\u201d Brown recounted Wednesday. \u201cAnd we delivered.\u201d But Brown\u2019s work in the 2020 election came at an enormous price. She contracted Covid-19 in June while on the campaign trail and has endured death threats for her very public activism. And over the weekend, a long-time Georgia organizer with whom Brown worked died \u2013 another heartbreak in the parade of Americans lost to the pandemic. Brown said her emotions Wednesday swung between \u201cextreme hope\u201d and deep sadness over the injustice and racial divisions that still persist. But she was determined to celebrate. She watched the inauguration on television from Atlanta \u2013 adorned in pearls, a \u201cbedazzled\u201d pair of Converse Chuck Taylor sneakers and an electric blue dress, gifted by a friend to thank Brown for her part in turning Georgia Democratic blue. \u201cAt the end of the day, what Black women have become masters at is not allowing the world to steal our joy,\u201d Brown said. Around the country, women of all ages and races pulled out their glue guns to pay joyful tribute to Harris by decorating their Chuck Taylors, the brand she sported so often on the campaign trail. Chucks and Pearls Day, a Facebook group started by Harris supporter Jeanette DeVaughn a little more than a month ago, had grown to more than 89,000 members by Wednesday morning. There, Harris supporters uploaded a steady stream of pictures of their Chucks, studded with pearls, rhinestones and even Swarovski crystals. Lace and satin ribbons often replaced shoestrings. DeVaughn, an Austin, Texas, grandmother who works part-time at an Amazon distribution center, said women identify with Harris\u2019 high-low style: \u201cclassy and sophisticated\u201d pearls paired with \u201dreally, really comfortable\u201d shoes. This month\u2019s violent siege at the US Capitol saddened DeVaughn because, she said, it was \u201cso disrespectful\u201d of the history-making nature of Harris\u2019 win. The pandemic and heavy security, she felt, had robbed Harris of the chance to enjoy her day as fully as her predecessors had. But DeVaughn said nothing would deter her from celebrating this week, either. Her inaugural wardrobe: A silky black cocktail dress and pearl-covered purple Chucks. For many, the party started days before Harris took her oath on Wednesday. At one online \u201cSip\u201d Sunday sponsored by Higher Heights of America and Essence magazine, a who\u2019s who of Black women in politics celebrated both Harris\u2019 success and their role in it. They also had fun. Spinderella \u2013 the DJ known as part of the hip-hop group Salt-N-Pepa \u2013 entertained the virtual crowd. Samara Davis, of the Black Bourbon Society, walked participants through how to prepare The Kamala, a whiskey sour concoction whose muddled raspberries and mint garnish evoked the AKA sorority\u2019s distinctive pink-and-green colors. Higher Heights\u2019 Carr and other activists also said they were readying themselves for the political battles that would begin as soon as this week. That includes building support for Biden\u2019s Covid-19 recovery relief package, boosting the federal minimum wage to $15 an hour and helping elevate another Black woman to the US Senate to fill the void now that Harris has ascended to higher office. Murray canvassed for President Barack Obama\u2019s barrier-breaking campaign more than a dozen years ago, but she felt compelled to do even more for the Biden-Harris ticket \u2013 given the parallels between her life and Harris\u2019 story. She, too, was raised in California by a single mom and traveled across the country to attend Howard University, one of the nation\u2019s pre-eminent HBCUs. She pledged AKA in her sophomore year, graduated in 2003 and went on to earn her law degree at Harvard. Last year, she joined forces with more than 5,000 women around the country to help make Wednesday\u2019s history happen \u2013 calling, writing and texting voters in battleground states from Arizona to Florida in the run-up to Election Day. Among their efforts: sending texts to 200,000 Pennsylvania residents, encouraging them to register to vote. They also mailed 20,000 postcards to low-propensity voters in Georgia to encourage them to cast ballots both in the presidential election and in the state\u2019s January 5 Senate runoffs. Murray has three young children, but the group was open to any woman who \u201ccared about the next generation,\u201d she said. The Momala in the title reflects the nickname Harris\u2019 stepchildren, Cole and Ella Emhoff, bestowed on her. On Wednesday, Murray was as busy ever. She joined her group\u2019s Facebook watch party. She monitored the inauguration on television with her husband and children. She texted almost constantly with her sorority sisters and other friends. As she watched the ceremony unfold, Murray marveled at the \u201cprophetic voice\u201d of 22-year-old Amanda Gorman, the youngest inaugural poet in US history, who spoke of a \u201cnation that isn\u2019t broken, but simply unfinished.\u201d She took comfort in Biden\u2019s promise to confront White supremacy head on and work to the heal the country\u2019s divides. And when Harris, resplendent in a purple coat and dress, uttered the oath of office, Murray joined her two daughters, ages 5 and 2, in wild screaming. \u201cThe best parts of American society were on display today \u2013 in contrast to what we saw two weeks ago,\u201d Murray said. \u201cIt feels like a dark cloud has lifted.\u201d",

            "article_content": "In his first words as President, Joe Biden offered a parable of American grit, healing and unity, leveraging resilience forged through personal loss and disdain for the \u201cuncivil war\u201d of modern politics in an inspirational rallying call to a sickened and divided nation. Destiny paired America\u2019s new leader \u2013 a man rocked by tragedy who found the strength to heal his own soul \u2013 with a country that needs to summon similar steel to overcome what he called its \u201ccascading crises.\u201d In a moving interlude to his inaugural address, silence fell over the US Capitol and the National Mall as Biden paused to lead Americans in a moment of silent prayer, to honor the more than 400,000 fellow citizens taken by Covid-19. But as he has done throughout a life scarred by family tragedies, Biden sought strength in the moment of mourning, willing the country to overcome its divides, after admitting that ignoring their existence was a \u201cfoolish fantasy.\u201d \u201cNow, we are going to be tested. Are we going to step up? All of us?\u201d Biden asked as he started into the country\u2019s vast interior on the West Front of the Capitol that was invaded by a marauding mob only two weeks ago. Despite warning of a \u201cwinter of peril,\u201d Biden\u2019s inaugural address was a rare moment of hope and inspiration nearly a year into the country\u2019s battle with a virus that has shut down normal life and fractured community and families. The 46th President struck a sharp contrast with the dark rant about \u201cAmerican carnage\u201d issued by Donald Trump in his inaugural address four years ago. The ex-President was unseen behind the walls of his Florida resort club at the hour when his tumultuous term expired. Biden didn\u2019t mention Trump. But by praising the survival of American democracy and condemning \u201cshouting,\u201d \u201cexhausting outrage,\u201d a \u201cstate of chaos\u201d and politics as a \u201craging fire destroying everything in its path,\u201d Biden clearly sought to turn the page from the discord of the Trump years. He also pointedly rejected the signature characteristic of the Trump era of lies which in the former president\u2019s refusal to accept his election defeat threatened the democratic structures of the country itself. \u201cWe must reject the culture in which facts themselves are manipulated and even manufactured,\u201d Biden said. Only two weeks ago, the platform on which Biden delivered his inaugural address was overcome by a pro-Trump mob on its way to insurrection in the Capitol. Memories of that outrage added poignancy to the new President\u2019s comment that \u201cat this hour, democracy has prevailed.\u201d Biden\u2019s address was less soaring than some inaugural addresses. But its power lay in the way he seemed to be talking to every individual American, almost like President Franklin Roosevelt in his fireside chats in which he guided the country out of the Great Depression. \u201cLet\u2019s start afresh, all of us, let\u2019s begin to listen to one another again, hear one another, show respect to one another.\u201d The swearing-in of Kamala Harris, America\u2019s first female, first Black and first South Asian vice president, will deliver qualified progress in the halting march to racial justice and gender equality. Biden\u2019s empathy was forged in the unfathomable horror of burying his first wife, infant daughter and adult son. Just as he comforted bereaved supporters on countless campaign trail rope lines, he is now assuming the nation\u2019s grief over the pandemic. After finding new reason to live following his own bereavements, he\u2019s challenging Americans to honor their own losses by uniting to win the battle to restore normal life.   Biden\u2019s first duty on his return to Washington Wednesday was to lead a moving sunset vigil under a purple sky at the Lincoln Memorial for those lost \u2013 a step never taken by Trump, a longtime pandemic denier who appeared to believe that dignifying the dead stained his own image. The solemn event, featuring Michigan nurse Lori Marie Key, who sang \u201cAmazing Grace,\u201d underscored Biden\u2019s promises to restore decency to the center of power as he seeks to nurture the country\u2019s battered soul. Under the marbled gaze of the statue of Abraham Lincoln, who took office in perhaps the only time when America has been more divided than today, lines of lights stretched like gravestones towards the distant Washington Monument. As he worked on his own inaugural address, Biden had to contemplate a pandemic that has never been worse, a vaccine rollout that is a confusing mess, an economy pulverized by shutdowns and a generation of kids who have missed critical months of in-person schooling.   His challenges have become even more acute since the election, as Trump\u2019s refusal to admit defeat and attempt to steal Biden\u2019s victory, as well as an insurrection against Congress, hammered Biden\u2019s legitimacy and exposed a White nationalist internal insurgency that will pose an ongoing threat to US security and democracy. America\u2019s current chasms suggest yet more synergy between Biden and his moment of history. Despite decades of worsening national polarization, the President-elect still thinks he can enlist his old Senate Republican sparring partner, Mitch McConnell, in passing elements of his legislative agenda and a new pandemic stimulus plan. Many Democrats are highly skeptical. And Republicans who live in fear of Trump and his 74 million voters have no reason to make Biden\u2019s presidency a success. But Biden\u2019s old-fashioned bet on building an administration on compromise at a time when such sentiments have rarely been less incentivized was attractive to many voters weary of Washington\u2019s partisan wars. And after Trump tried to make it a liability in the campaign, his half-century career as a Washington insider might just equip him to overhaul the lame federal response to Covid-19 and lead the country out of its nightmare. When Biden placed his hand on the Bible on Wednesday and takes the oath of office, he completed a political and personal journey that had seemed fated to fall short of the White House. The man who was once one of the youngest senators in history became at 78, the country\u2019s oldest president. This day would never have come had Biden followed his initial instincts and given up the newly won Delaware US Senate seat he won in 1972 after his wife and infant daughter died in a car crash. Biden spent months by the side of his surviving sons, Beau and Hunter, as they slowly recovered from serious injuries. In the late 1980s, he experienced his own health crises with a brain aneurysm that nearly killed him. But he bounced back. Tragedy would visit Biden again in May 2015, when Beau, an Iraq War veteran and Democratic rising star, died of brain cancer.   Biden always saw Beau as a better version of himself. A tearful President-elect on Wednesday confessed: \u201cLadies and gentleman, I only have one regret: he\u2019s not here because we should be introducing him as president.\u201d Beau\u2019s death ultimately convinced Biden not to mount a bid for the Democratic nomination in 2016 against Hillary Clinton amid concern about his family\u2019s emotional endurance for a race. But fate called him back into the political arena because of Trump\u2019s aberrant presidency and the commander in chief\u2019s equivocation over condemning marches by White supremacists in Charlottesville, Virginia. \u201cJoe Biden has a healing heart. He has been through so much,\u201d former Vice President Al Gore told CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper on Tuesday evening. Biden is now a far more disciplined politician than he was for much of his career. His portrayal in the seminal \u201cWhat It Takes \u2013 The Way to the White House,\u201d an account of the 1988 presidential campaign by the late Richard Ben Cramer, was as a political charmer, with a dazzling smile, glad-handing style and preening self-belief that the presidency was his destiny. But Biden\u2019s 1988 campaign dissolved amid a plagiarism scandal. In 2008, he dropped out after an anemic showing in the Iowa caucuses. Even when he was selected by Barack Obama as his vice presidential nominee, many of the younger aides around the soon-to-be president considered Biden a loose-lipped caricature \u2013 an impression he strengthened by adding to his long list of political gaffes. But Vice President Biden\u2019s steady stewardship of the Recovery Act \u2013 which added to his pedigree as he sought the presidency this time around \u2013 won him admirers, and after eight years of loyalty to Obama, he was loved and respected in the White House. Now, slowed a little by age, and with the windy opening statements that set eyes rolling in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee just a memory, Biden has displayed unexpected late-in-life political adeptness. Only a year ago, it seemed his political ambitions would again founder after terrible results in the Iowa and New Hampshire nominating races. But with trademark persistence, he hauled himself back up off the mat with a famous win in South Carolina, which rocketed him to the Democratic nomination and the presidency. His handling of Trump\u2019s unprecedented disruption during a treacherous transition was distilled from the wisdom of decades in high office, and a willingness to subvert his own ego for the good of the nation \u2013 another stark comparison with the outgoing President. His campaign benefited from the curtailment of an exhausting travel schedule. But every time he needed to show gravitas and poise \u2013 like in the debates against Trump and at the Democratic National Convention \u2013 Biden delivered, showing a new, spare speaking style that was likely a preview of his presidential bully pulpit and was shaped by his tragedies and redemption. That durability in the face of personal angst is the force that finally propelled Biden to his longed-for destination \u2013 the Oval Office \u2013 on Wednesday. And it\u2019s why he might just be the man for a perilous American moment.",

            "article_content": "Two weeks after a deadly insurrection put on display the White outrage that threatens the country\u2019s multiracial democracy, a dramatically different scene unfolded at the US Capitol. On January 20, Joe Biden and Kamala Harris were sworn into office. The inauguration of the first female, first Black and first South Asian vice president following the aforementioned assault did two things at once \u2013 marked a hopeful turning point in the long fight for racial representation and justice, and underscored in sobering fashion that confronting White supremacy will be one of the new administration\u2019s main challenges. Harris\u2019 political rise even just over the past one and a half years is nothing to scoff at. Maybe most obviously, the former California senator\u2019s ascent to the vice presidency will change the face of power in a literal way. There was no shortage of coverage of how the 2020 Democratic primary field, which Harris was a part of, began as one of the most noteworthy in history. More specifically, the diversity of the slate of candidates who vied for the nomination was unprecedented: Latino, Asian, Black, gay, female. In December 2019, though, Harris suspended her campaign, as the field gradually congealed around straightness and Whiteness and maleness. The US Capitol attack fits into the history of White backlash It was no small thing, then, when Biden chose Harris as his running mate in August. \u201cIt just feels like Black girls like me can run for class president. Black girls like me can go for the big things in life like she did,\u201d Paris Bond, a teenager, told CNN that month. Or as Harris\u2019 late mother used to say to her barrier-busting daughter: \u201cKamala, you may be the first to do many things, but make sure you\u2019re not the last.\u201d Just as moving: when the Democratic duo trounced Trump in the November general election. Propelled by a multiracial coalition, Biden and Harris not only thwarted the reelection campaign of a man who used his Whiteness as a weapon \u2013 they also ended the perverse pageantry of an administration that embraced virulent masculinity. But as vice president, Harris will be able to offer more than symbolic representation. \u201cJoe Biden\u2019s vice president will most likely be the most powerful vice president in history because the trend is toward more powerful vice presidents. Joe Biden knows the value of having a vice president with lots of responsibility, and Joe Biden is going to inherit an epic disaster,\u201d as former Barack Obama senior adviser Dan Pfeiffer said last year, referring to the nightmarish toll of the novel coronavirus pandemic. Already, Harris has indicated how she\u2019ll battle the once-in-a-century crisis and its attendant racial disparities \u2013 disparities that are the result of a history of discriminatory policy. Last May, she introduced the Covid-19 Racial and Ethnic Disparities Task Force Act to \u201cbring together healthcare and other policy experts, community-based organizations, and federal, state, local, tribal and territorial leaders to confront the racial and ethnic disparities of this pandemic head on.\u201d In December, Biden selected Marcella Nunez-Smith, an associate professor of internal medicine, public health and management at Yale University, to lead the health equity task force. \u201cHealth care free of racism and discrimination is a right and not a privilege,\u201d Nunez-Smith said during a web briefing last month. \u201cIt is time for us to respond to the crisis of discrimination in health care.\u201d In other words, Harris will change what power looks like and directly influence whom it serves.   But even with those triumphal dimensions, the new administration, from the very beginning, will have to navigate the resurgent currents of White supremacy. In an interview with NPR last week, Harris didn\u2019t mince her words in her condemnation of the recent attack on the Capitol. \u201cIt was the same thing that went through my mind when I saw Charlottesville,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s the same thing that went through my mind when I saw a picture of Emmett Till. It is not the first time I have seen a demonstration like what you are describing in the history of our country.\u201d That Harris drew parallels between the horror of the Trump years and the brutality of decades past made sense. The seizure of the Capitol was a gruesome reminder that White supremacy has always been tightly stitched into the American fabric. Indeed, historians have noted how the takeover echoed the Reconstruction period in terms of White backlash to racial equality. For instance, in 1873, more than 150 armed White men \u2013 most affiliated with the Ku Klux Klan \u2013 murdered between 60 and 150 members of a Black militia that had been defending the Grant Parish courthouse in Colfax, Louisiana, following the state\u2019s bitterly contested 1872 gubernatorial election. \u201cThe bloodiest single instance of racial carnage in the Reconstruction era, the Colfax massacre taught many lessons, including the lengths to which some opponents of Reconstruction would go to regain their accustomed authority,\u201d the Columbia University professor Eric Foner explains in his 1988 book, \u201cReconstruction: America\u2019s Unfinished Revolution, 1863-1877.\u201d Accustomed authority. More than one and a half centuries after the end of the Civil War, the US has yet to deal fully with the enduring threat of White entitlement to political control, as evidenced by the Confederate flag-waving mob\u2019s assault on the Capitol. \u201cWe still have a lot of work to do,\u201d Harris said in the interview. There might be a consoling prospect to the carnage earlier this month, however. The attack could provide Biden and Harris with the political momentum necessary to act more vigorously than some of their Democratic antecedents \u2013 to banish White supremacist groups and clamp down on the corruption and racism that afflict police departments, Ronald Brownstein argued last week. Often, the US assumes itself to be better than it is, particularly when it comes to nourishing racial progress. The new administration will have the opportunity to narrow the distance between that assumption and reality.",

            "article_content": "One of the great tragedies of the past year, as some 400,000 Americans lost their lives to Covid-19, was not only that many victims died alone \u2013 their loved ones robbed of the chance to say goodbye \u2013 but that the pain of that loss was whitewashed by a President who chose to minimize and deny it. In a somber ceremony at the Lincoln Memorial on Tuesday night that was his first stop in Washington, President-elect Joe Biden signaled that honoring that grief and the terrible toll of the last year would be at the very heart of his administration. Elected because of his empathy and his compassion for Americans, who are suffering through a confluence of crises that have created a time of great uncertainty, Biden spoke just a few words as the sun set over the National Mall, casting a rosy glow in the twilight. The President-elect told Americans he shared in their grief \u2013 with his own understanding deepened by the loss of his first wife and daughter in a car accident as a young man and the loss of his son Beau to cancer at the age of 46. \u201cIt\u2019s hard sometimes to remember, but that\u2019s how we heal. It\u2019s important to do that as a nation,\u201d Biden said in brief remarks before 400 lights were illuminated along the edges of the Lincoln Memorial Reflecting Pool, marking the more than 400,000 Americans who have died from Covid-19. He and his wife, Jill Biden, watched in silence, alongside Vice President-elect Kamala Harris and her husband, Doug Emhoff, as the reflections of the lights glimmered in the water. Hundreds of towns, cities and communities across the country joined in the tribute, lighting up buildings from the Empire State Building in New York to the Space Needle in Seattle. Cardinal Wilton Gregory, the archbishop of Washington, delivered the invocation and gospel singer Yolanda Adams performed \u201cHallelujah\u201d after Biden spoke. Harris spoke briefly at the memorial, noting that \u201cfor many months, we have grieved by ourselves. Tonight, we grieve and begin healing together.\u201d \u201cThough we may be physically separated, we, the American people, are united in spirit and my abiding hope, my abiding prayer, is that we emerge from this ordeal with a new wisdom: to cherish simple moments, to imagine new possibilities and to open our hearts just a little bit more to one another,\u201d Harris said. The President-elect arrived in Washington, DC, on Tuesday for the start of his inaugural ceremonies at a dark moment in American history, preparing to take his oath of office as the US passes 400,000 coronavirus deaths and is more divided than at any time since the Civil War. As he departed for the nation\u2019s capital earlier in the day, Biden gave an emotional farewell to his home state of Delaware, his voice breaking at times as he thanked the state\u2019s residents for believing in him and standing with him throughout his career. \u201cI\u2019ll always be a proud son of the state of Delaware,\u201d Biden said at the Delaware National Guard headquarters in New Castle County. \u201cExcuse the emotion,\u201d he said, tears streaming down his face, \u201cbut when I die, Delaware will be written on my heart and the hearts of all of us \u2013 all the Bidens. We love you all. You\u2019ve been there for us in the good and the bad.\u201d He gave a moving tribute to his son Beau, who died of brain cancer in 2015 at the age of 46, stating that he had hoped to see his son become president one day. \u201cWe should be introducing him as president,\u201d he said. The President-elect also noted the historical arc of his career witnessing the civil rights struggle as well as signs of progress in the United States. He said he came home to Wilmington, Delaware, from law school after Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated \u2013 inspired by the turmoil to become a public defender. In 2009, he made the journey to Washington with Barack Obama, who became the nation\u2019s first Black president. And he is returning to Washington, DC, this week \u201cto meet a Black woman of South Asian descent, to be sworn in as President and vice president of the United States. That\u2019s America,\u201d he said Tuesday. The nation\u2019s continuing struggles for equality and racial justice also drew Biden into the 2020 presidential race. He has said he decided to seek the highest office after watching President Donald Trump\u2019s dismissive handling of the deadly White supremacist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, when he said there were \u201cvery fine people on both sides.\u201d Now intent on healing a deeply fractured country, Biden\u2019s task has never seemed more daunting after Trump incited a riot with his lies that the presidential election was stolen, which led an armed mob to storm the Capitol on January 6 and resulted in the deaths of five people, including a Capitol Police officer. On Tuesday, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said that the mob was \u201cprovoked\u201d by Trump, in a remarkable final rebuke of the President after four years in which Republicans have often stayed silent in the face of the President\u2019s misdeeds.   \u201cThe mob was fed lies,\u201d McConnell, a Kentucky Republican, said on the Senate floor Tuesday. \u201cThey were provoked by the President and other powerful people, and they tried to use fear and violence to stop a specific proceeding of the first branch of the federal government which they did not like.\u201d But McConnell noted that democracy had prevailed, even in the face of violent threats, and that Congress carried out its duties by certifying the election: \u201cWe\u2019ll have a safe and successful inaugural right here on the very front of the Capitol,\u201d he said. McConnell argued that the November election \u201cdid not hand any side a mandate for sweeping ideological change,\u201d given the closely divided Senate and House. But he said Republicans would seek common ground with Democrats as Biden takes office: \u201cWe are to pursue bipartisan agreement everywhere we can, and check and balance one another, respectfully, where we must.\u201d Biden had hoped to infuse his arrival in Washington with a nostalgic twist by riding the rails from his home in Delaware, but that was deemed too much of a security risk at a time when the nation is facing threats from within. Instead the President-elect will arrive in a capital city Tuesday that has been transformed into a fortress with more than 20,000 National Guard troops securing the streets and protecting buildings that symbolize the enduring history of democracy in this country, which has seemed very much in peril in recent weeks. CNN\u2019s Pentagon team reported Tuesday afternoon that 12 National Guard members have been removed from inauguration duty as federal authorities vet those who are stationed in Washington, DC, to secure the ceremonies. Army Gen. Daniel Hokanson told CNN that two of the individuals were flagged due to \u201cinappropriate\u201d comments and texts, while another 10 were removed for questionable behavior found during the vetting. Col. Michael Dugas, provost marshal of the National Guard Bureau, told CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper Tuesday that at least 17,000 members have been vetted so far. With the twice-impeached Trump still prowling the White House \u2013 fuming about his election grievances and upcoming trial in the US Senate as he prepares to leave for Palm Beach, Florida, before the new President is sworn in Wednesday \u2013 Biden hopes to shift the nation\u2019s attention to his agenda for halting the Covid-19 pandemic, accelerating the troubled vaccine rollout and rebuilding a struggling economy that has left millions unemployed. The President-elect has been working on the inauguration speech that he will deliver at the US Capitol on Wednesday, which will mark the beginning of his effort to unite the country after four dark and tumultuous years under Trump, who is skipping the ceremony. The Covid-19 pandemic had already forced organizers to reimagine the day\u2019s ceremonies, including the traditional swearing-in of the new president on the West Front of the Capitol. Those plans were complicated by the January 6 siege of the Capitol by Trump supporters, who shattered glass and ravaged the historic building, forcing the Secret Service to keep plans in flux to ensure that traditional transfer of power will transpire peacefully and safely. In that unnerving environment, the military has been intensely vetting the National Guard troops to make sure there are no bad actors who would do harm during this week\u2019s ceremonies. With Trump\u2019s decision to duck out of Washington Wednesday morning to fly to Florida, he has dispensed with both with the traditional welcome of the incoming President and first lady at the North Portico and the joint ride over to the Capitol for the ceremony. Instead, Trump took the unusual step of asking staff to arrange a sendoff of his own at Joint Base Andrews, suggesting that he\u2019d like to see a red carpet, a Color Guard and a 21-gun-salute. On Wednesday, Biden will attend church at St. Matthews in Washington, DC, with all four top congressional leaders from both parties. The President-elect will also lay a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier, joined by former President Barack Obama and and first lady Michelle Obama, former President George W. Bush and first lady Laura Bush, and former President Bill Clinton and former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.

            "article_content": "They moved in an \u201corganized and practiced fashion\u201d as they pushed through crowds toward entrances to the US Capitol. On the inside, several maintained formation, putting their hands on each other\u2019s shoulders to keep in lockstep. Some communicated over radios, while others gave directions with hand signals and voice calls. Members of militant groups that stormed the seat of legislative power earlier this month during the certification of the presidential vote have quickly become a top focus of federal law enforcement investigating the January 6 insurrection. At least six alleged rioters with ties to self-styled militias have been named in criminal complaints released in recent days, representing a small but alarming segment of the dozens of defendants charged to date. RELATED: Decoding the extremist symbols and groups at the Capitol Hill insurrection Decoding the extremist symbols and groups at the Capitol Hill insurrection Some of the groups present, like The Oath Keepers, try to draw their ranks from former service-members and law enforcement officers, relying on their tactical training to patrol and intimidate at protests across the country. Many have been radicalized by racial rhetoric and false claims coming from the Trump White House, security experts say. Through court documents and interviews with multiple officials familiar with the investigation, their organized role in the siege of the Capitol is coming into view and being built into cases that could potentially carry charges of sedition, indicating a concerted effort to incite a revolt against the government. The information is also key to the efforts to vet the police and National Guard officers who are guarding Washington, DC, this week. On Tuesday, two members of the National Guard were removed from inauguration duty, a defense official confirmed to CNN. \u201cThat is a tier-one, top priority for both the U.S. Attorney\u2019s office and our federal law enforcement partners, to see whether there was this overarching command and control, and whether there were these organized teams that were organized to breach the Capitol, and then perhaps try to accomplish some type of a mission inside the Capitol,\u201d acting US Attorney for the District of Columbia Michael Sherwin said Friday. In the pre-dawn hours of Sunday, FBI agents fanned out around a home in rural Woodstock, Ohio. Inside was the founder of the Ohio State Regular Militia, a group of veterans who\u2019d made the 450-mile drive to the nation\u2019s capital, fueled by what they describe as a sense of patriotic duty as well as \u200ba history of grievances against the government and a belief in false claims about the 2020 election that they aired on social media. Facebook posts promoting violence still circulated even after insurrection \u201cWe made it to DC. Spent all day protecting various speakers on the main stage in Freedom Plaza,\u201d Jessica Watkins, the Ohio militia founder, wrote on January 6 in a message posted on the right-wing friendly social media website Parler. In the lead up to the insurrection, Watkins, an Army veteran and bartender, according to an interview she gave to the Ohio Capital Journal last week, had vented her anger about pandemic lockdowns and repeated a \u201cstop the steal\u201d hashtag online, referencing the lies spread by President Donald Trump that election fraud prevented his November victory. She posted about plans to provide medical care and security at the planned protests, offering to escort Trump supporters to their hotels if they felt unsafe. But soon after arriving to the Capitol protest, Watkins and her fellow militiamen allegedly moved to the front lines of a takeover. Alongside eight to 10 other people in paramilitary gear and Oathkeeper paraphernalia (the Ohio State Regular Militia pays dues to that group, according to a charging document), Watkins began \u201caggressively approaching an entrance to the Capitol building,\u201d an FBI agent wrote in an affidavit filed in federal court. \u201cThese individuals,\u201d the agent alleged, \u201cmove in an organized and practiced fashion and force their way to the front of the crowd gathered around a door to the U.S. Capitol.\u201d Having broken in, she made her way with the group into the rotunda and squared off with police officers who tried to block their way, she later wrote on Parler. \u201cWe never smashed anything, stole anything, burned anything, and truthfully we were very respectful with Capitol Hill PD until they attacked us,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThen we stood our ground and drew the line.\u201d Federal authorities arrested Watkins on Sunday and charged her with knowingly entering a restricted building. Another member of the Ohio group, former Marine Donovan Crowl, was also arrested in that state Sunday for his alleged role in the riots. Thomas Caldwell, of Virginia, was arrested on Tuesday and is referred to as an apparent leader of the Oath Keepers in a charging document. According to the FBI, he stormed the Capitol alongside Watkins and Crowl and was \u201cinvolved in planning and coordinating the January 6 breach.\u201d It\u2019s not clear who is representing the three in court. The arrests of the two from Ohio are among the more than 90 criminal cases unsealed publicly against participants of the insurrection in the past two weeks. Prosecutors had initially focused on some of the more notorious and viral crimes, like the man seen walking in the Senate chambers with zip ties and the rioter who wore a \u201cCamp Auschwitz\u201d T-shirt, but began moving on alleged \u201cmilitia\u201d members in the past few days. Many established self-styled militias have long aligned with anti-government and extremist causes in pockets of the US, and their camouflage gear and military hardware was not out of place in a horde that also included tell-tale signs of hate groups, like Confederate flags and Nazi paraphernalia. Heading 'into a buzzsaw': Why extremism experts fear the Capitol attack is just the beginning Groups like the Oath Keepers, described by the FBI as \u201ca large but loosely organized collection of militia who believe that the federal government has been co-opted by a shadowy conspiracy that is trying to strip American citizens of their rights,\u201d first became a prominent antagonizing presence at protests in Ferguson, Missouri, in 2014. Last year, the vigilante groups became heavily armed fixtures at nationwide racial justice rallies spawned in the wake of George Floyd\u2019s killing. At times, local police seemed to welcome their presence amid demonstrations that occasionally grew violent. In other cases, they fueled the violence themselves, shooting and killing unarmed protestors, like in a chaotic episode in Kenosha, Wisconsin, last year where authorities charged a teenager with felony homicide. The group\u2019s reliance on military tactics adds an explosive element to already highly charged situations, hate group researchers say. Army reservist with secret-level security clearance among the latest charged in connection with Capitol riot \u201cThis dangerous crossover is one of the reasons we continue to be alarmed by events like the January 6 attack, which provide right-wing extremists ample opportunity to mix with and potentially influence \u2018regular\u2019 Americans,\u201d said Oren Segal of the Anti-Defamation League\u2019s Center on Extremism. As lawmakers voted to certify the electoral victory of President-Elect Joe Biden inside the Capitol, some men affiliated with so-called militia groups were attacking police officers outside and helping clear the way for people convinced the White House was being stolen to make their way in. Colorado man Robert Gieswein, who, according to an FBI affidavit, appears to be affiliated with the Three Percenters, a militia movement that believes \u201ca small force with a just cause can overthrow a tyrannical government if armed and prepared,\u201d is accused of helping to lift and shove a barrier against a group of Capitol Police officers as he tried to force his way into the building. Jon Schaffer, the frontman of a popular heavy metal band from Indiana, allegedly sprayed a Capitol Police officer with bear spray while wearing a hat the read \u201cOath Keepers Lifetime Member,\u201d according to FBI documents. Both men are facing charges related to entering a restricted building and engaging in violence. Schaffer was arrested Sunday in Indiana. It\u2019s not clear if Gieswein is in custody. It\u2019s also not clear if either man has retained legal representation. Meanwhile, prosecutors in Washington, DC, have dedicated a team to examine potential charges of sedition, scouring travel records, communications and funding channels of rioters suspected of organizing and planning the attempt to disrupt the transfer of presidential power, according to Sherwin, the acting US attorney. As they\u2019ve combed through troves of images and video taken during the insurrection, investigators have tracked the military-style coordination among some of the rioters. Some members of the mob inside the Capitol can be seen on video walking with their hands on each other\u2019s shoulders, which authorities believe indicates they were trained in certain paramilitary techniques, according to a person familiar with the investigation. Some also used radios to communicate as they moved through the Capitol, according to a law enforcement official familiar with the investigation. Timothy Hale-Cusanelli, an Army reservist charged over the weekend for his alleged role in the insurrection, used voiced and hand signals to encourage rioters to advance through the building, according to court documents. 'Far too close:' Army secretary reveals sobering details on riot Federal law enforcement agencies have warned in recent days of the potential for even more extremist-inspired violence across the country, including at Wednesday\u2019s Inauguration. It\u2019s unclear, however, to what extent the threat will materialize, as the failure to secure the Capitol has led authorities to erect a protective fortress around the perimeter of Washington\u2019s downtown government center. Even before their arrest, a conspiratorial bent had informed a plan for members of the Ohio State Regular Militia to stay away from Washington during the inaugural events. It\u2019s a \u201ctrap,\u201d Crowl, the ex-marine, told The New Yorker in an interview before his arrest, adding in an expletive.",

            "article_content": "President-elect Joe Biden will take office Wednesday with high expectations and largely positive reviews of how he has handled the transition, according to a new CNN Poll conducted by SSRS. But those rosy assessments of Biden come as negative perceptions of how things are going in the United States are at the highest level since 2009. Biden will take office with a store of goodwill in his corner: Two-thirds of Americans approve (66%) of the way Biden is handling the presidential transition, and his favorability rating has climbed 7 points compared with a pre-election poll in October (59% view him favorably now, compared to 52% then). The public is less positive about the way the rest of elected Washington is handling the transition. Most disapprove of President Donald Trump\u2019s combative handling of the time since the election (70% disapprove), and his fellow Republicans in Congress earn similarly negative reviews (66% disapprove). About half (51%) approve of the way Democrats in Congress have handled it.   Once Biden is sworn in and the results of Georgia\u2019s Senate runoffs are certified, the Democrats will control the presidency, the House and the Senate. Most Americans say single-party control will be good for the country (53%), more than those that said the same about Republican control of the presidency and Congress following the 2016 election (49%), but fewer than those that felt that way about Democratic control after 2008 (59%). Most say it is likely that Biden will achieve several key goals, including signing into law another coronavirus stimulus bill (83% say that is very or somewhat likely), restoring relations with US allies (74%), ensuring that 100 million doses of the coronavirus vaccine are administered by the 100-day mark of his presidency (70%) and establishing a government-run health insurance option that anyone could purchase (64%). But there is skepticism that he will be able to ease political divisions in the country (53% say that is unlikely). And the Republicans to whom Biden would need to appeal to in order to succeed are the most likely to say it will not work (88% unlikely). The poll shows that views of Biden himself start out sharply polarized, with as large a partisan gap in expectations for his presidency as Trump faced at the start of his term in 2017, and drastically larger than the partisan divide in expectations for Barack Obama before he took office. CNN Poll: Trump's approval rating reaches new low as term ends Overall, 61% of adults expect Biden to do a very good or fairly good job as president, more than said so about Trump in 2017 (48%), but well below the share who expected good things from Obama before he took office (79%). Nearly all Democrats expect Biden to do well as president, 96%, the same as said so about Obama. But among Republicans, the share expecting Biden to do a good job as president is 40 points lower than the share who said the same about Obama (57% of Republicans said Obama would do a good job, while 17% say Biden will). That 79-point chasm between Democrats and Republicans on Biden is identical to the gap between Republicans and Democrats in January 2017 over whether Trump would do a good job as president (93% of Republicans said he would do a good job vs. 14% of Democrats). Favorability ratings for the incoming vice president, Kamala Harris, are higher than they have been at any point in CNN\u2019s polling on her. Overall, 51% have a favorable opinion, 39% an unfavorable one. Opinions on Harris are also split by party, with 90% of Democrats saying they have a favorable view of her vs. 9% of Republicans. Jill Biden\u2019s favorability rating is largely positive and about as high as her husband\u2019s (58% have a favorable opinion of the soon-to-be first lady) with 28% expressing a negative view of her. As was true during last year\u2019s presidential campaign, Democrats and Republicans are living in completely different worlds when asked what the biggest problems are in the country today. Overall, 46% say the coronavirus outbreak is the largest problem, with 21% choosing political divisions, 15% the economy, 10% racial injustice and 7% national security. Among Democrats, 65% say the coronavirus is the most important problem, with racial injustice second at 16%. Among Republicans, though, 32% choose political divisions, 30% the economy, 25% coronavirus and less than 1% say it is racial injustice. Majorities across parties, though, say things in America today are going poorly: 77% say so overall, including 91% of Democrats, 77% of independents and 61% of Republicans. That\u2019s the largest share saying things are going poorly in CNN polling since April 2009.   Republicans\u2019 views on the state of the country have worsened significantly since October (from 77% saying things were going well then to 37% now). That is typical of a party losing the presidency, but it is a steeper dropoff than among Democrats after their 2016 election loss (from 85% saying things were going well before the election to 61% ahead of Trump\u2019s inauguration). And perceptions of the economy are worse than they were at the start of Trump\u2019s term: 43% say it is in good shape today compared with 57% in January 2017. About 6 in 10 overall (61%) say they think the country will be better off in four years than it is today, more than said so in January 2017 (47%). But that too is divided by party. Among Democrats, 95% say the country will be better off in four years, while 73% of Republicans say it will be worse. Methodology The methodology and weighting for the poll has been modified compared with previous CNN polls. Interviews conducted on cell phones made up 75% of the total, up from 65% in prior surveys. Dialing extended over six days rather than four days, allowing for more effort to be made to contact those who are not easily reachable. Demographic weighting was adjusted to account for more discrete education categories broken out by race, and a geographic weight was applied to ensure representative distribution by population density. In addition, results were weighted for partisan identification and lean among independents, with targets computed using an average of the current poll plus three recent CNN polls. The new CNN Poll was conducted by SSRS January 9 through 14 among a random national sample of 1,003 adults reached on landlines or cellphones by a live interviewer. Results for the full sample have a margin of sampling error of plus or minus 3.7 percentage points.",

            "article_content": "President-elect Joe Biden\u2019s shouldering of the presidency on Wednesday will finally end twice-impeached Donald Trump\u2019s four-year assault on truth and law and a corrupt administration set to test the propriety of the presidency to his final hours in office with a flurry of controversial pardons. The inauguration will be the culmination of an epic week for a battered nation haunted by sickness, death and political divisions in which constitutional principles will triumph over lies and insurrection with the transfer of power from one president to the next. The week begins amid unmistakable signs of a new presidency getting up to speed while an old administration dissolves in disgrace and disarray, with rappers and white collar criminals likely to be on Trump\u2019s list of pardons expected to be issued on Tuesday. Biden\u2019s new team will face the gravest national challenges of any new White House in 90 years, with the pandemic running riot, nearly 400,000 citizens dead, an economy in ruins and a vaccine rollout faltering. A nation on edge braces for this week's transfer of power The week begins amid unmistakable signs of a new presidency getting up to speed while an old administration dissolves in disgrace and disarray, with Trump expected to issue a flood of pardons and commutations on Tuesday including for rappers and white collar criminals. A massive garrison of thousands of troops and security forces in Washington, DC, and the ugly scar of iron fences ringing the White House and the Capitol to protect the inauguration from violent pro-Trump mobs bear witness to Trump\u2019s legacy of incitement. There will be neither crowds thronging the National Mall nor footage of the new President and first lady waltzing at glitzy inaugural balls. The muted pageantry will underscore the mission history has assigned to the oldest President ever to be sworn into office \u2013 that of digging his nation out of multiple crises. After four years in which Trump tore at America\u2019s racial wounds as a tool of power, there will, however, be a sense of history as California Sen. Kamala Harris becomes the first female, Black and South Asian vice president when she is sworn into office by Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor. Biden\u2019s team, which has been hampered by Trump\u2019s refusal to allow a peaceful, cooperative transition, is gearing up a multi-front federal government effort to battle Covid-19, which a disinterested Trump always failed to initiate. The President-elect warns that the dire public health situation will get worse before it gets better but is preaching unity and seeking to inspire Americans beaten down by a gruesome 10 months to muster for a final assault on the virus. \u201cOut of all the peril of this moment, I want you to know, I give you my word, I see the promise,\u201d Biden said on Friday. \u201cNow we\u2019re being so optimistic about America, as optimistic as I\u2019ve ever been. We have everything we need, but the will must be demonstrated. So come Wednesday, we begin a new chapter.\u201d   Biden is preparing a series of executive actions as soon as he takes office, including rejoining the Paris climate accord and ending a travel ban for citizens from some mainly Muslim countries, which will change America\u2019s outward face to the world. Trump stayed hidden during his last White House weekend, with comings and goings of family members, officials and his legal team hinting at the pardon spree that sources said Sunday could cover around 100 people but is not expected to include a highly contentious self-pardon. And in a last-minute move that will make it harder for Biden\u2019s administration to shake Trump\u2019s influence, the National Security Agency agreed to install Trump loyalist Michael Ellis, a National Security Council staffer, as its general counsel. The position is a civil service job rather than a political appointment, a designation that makes it harder for Biden to fire Ellis. With Washington still traumatized by the assault on the Capitol, shocking new video released by the New Yorker showing a mob incited into an insurrection by Trump offered fresh evidence of the President\u2019s culpability in an attack on the American government. Claims by rioters wearing \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d hats that they were acting on behalf of Trump are likely to take center stage in Trump\u2019s Senate impeachment trial, which threatens to slow Biden\u2019s hopes of a fast start to his own presidency. Terrifying scope of Capitol attack becoming clearer as Washington locks down for Biden's inauguration A new CNN poll released Sunday revealed the poisoned legacy Trump will leave behind. Only 19% of Republicans believe Biden was legitimately elected following weeks of lies perpetrated by the commander-in-chief and his conservative propagandists that the election was stolen. The lack of a shared national truth will hamper Biden\u2019s hopes of forging a national response to the pandemic and has left the Republican Party locked in civil war. And if recent history is any guide, the last two days of Trump\u2019s presidency will bring more chaos and challenges to the rule of law, before he leaves Washington Wednesday morning for a luxurious post-presidency in Florida. The Biden administration\u2019s most important priority will be to rescue the faltering rollout of new vaccines that carry the promise of finally ending a pandemic that has never been more deadly. Incoming White House chief of staff Ron Klain said Sunday on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d that \u201cwe\u2019re inheriting a huge mess here \u2026 but we have a plan to fix it.\u201d Biden hopes to administer 100 million doses of two-stage coronavirus vaccines in his first 100 days. The US is currently still well short of the 20 million doses in American arms Trump\u2019s team had promised by the end of December amid poor coordination in states and the lack of a federal plan. Rochelle Walensky, Biden\u2019s incoming director of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, warned on Sunday that the already horrific toll of the virus would get worse in setting initial expectations for the new White House. Biden chief of staff doesn't rule out stopping intelligence briefings for Trump \u201cBy the middle of February, we expect half a million deaths in this country,\u201d Walensky told CBS\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation.\u201d Medical experts had hoped that the pandemic would peak in its latest, most dangerous wave in the coming weeks and that cases and deaths would ease in the spring. But former Food and Drug Commissioner Dr. Scott Gottlieb warned that a more transmissible variant of the virus would begin to dominate new cases in the coming weeks and maintain high infection rates. \u201cThe only backstop against this new variant is the fact that we will have a lot of infection by then, so there\u2019ll be a lot of immunity in the population and we will be vaccinating more people, but this really changes the equation,\u201d Gottlieb said, also on \u201cFace the Nation.\u201d Biden plans to sign an executive order requiring masks on federal property and during interstate travel and is urging all Americans to wear face coverings for 100 days. But this is one area where Trump\u2019s efforts to shatter Biden\u2019s legitimacy could have a deadly consequence since it will be a challenge for the new President to convince Americans who falsely believe he stole the election. Klain also told CNN he was confident that the Secret Service and the National Guard would keep the inauguration safe on Wednesday but expressed concern about potential violence across the country. \u201cI think the events of the past few weeks have proven out just how damaged the soul of America has been and how important is to restore it. That work starts on Wednesday,\u201d Klain told Tapper. Exacerbating the multiple crises facing his new administration, Biden will enter office with a ghost Cabinet, without any of his key nominees confirmed by the Republican Senate that has shown little urgency despite the extreme circumstances. Democrats will take control since Harris will have the capacity to cast the deciding vote on deadlocked legislation in the 50-50 chamber, once the two Democrats who won Georgia Senate runoff races are seated. But Trump\u2019s looming trial after his historic second impeachment last week threatens to further slow Biden\u2019s early momentum and his $1.9 trillion pandemic crisis legislation. Incoming Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer is seeking to craft a trial that will allow the Senate to do two things at once. Raskin: I'm not losing my son in 2020 and my country in 2021 The Democrats\u2019 lead impeachment manager, Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland, told Tapper that it would be wrong to give the outgoing President a pass given the severity of his actions. \u201cI don\u2019t think anybody would seriously argue that we should establish a precedent, where every president on the way out the door has two weeks or three weeks or four weeks to try to incite an armed insurrection against the union or organize a coup against the union, and if it succeeds, he becomes a dictator, and if it fails, he\u2019s not subject to impeachment or conviction because we just want to let bygones be bygones,\u201d Raskin said on \u201cState of the Union.\u201d In recent days, Vice President Mike Pence has been performing many of the valedictory duties normally undertaken by a president since Trump has declined to deliver the kind of farewell address that is customary. On Sunday, in one of his final official speeches as vice president, Pence spoke at Fort Drum, New York. \u201cI have faith that the day will come when we put these challenging times in the past and emerge stronger and better than ever,\u201d Pence said. \u201cWe will heal our land. We will renew our strength,\u201d he added, without noting Trump\u2019s denial and mismanagement of the pandemic and refusal to preside over a peaceful transfer of power that immeasurably worsened those challenging times.",

            "article_content": "Vice President-elect Kamala Harris will officially resign Monday from her US Senate seat, ending her four-year Senate career, according to a Harris aide. The move comes two days before she\u2019s inaugurated on Wednesday, making history as the first female, first Black and first South Asian vice president. Aides say Harris has already started the process of her resignation, having notified California Gov. Gavin Newsom of her intent and sent her formal indications that she\u2019ll be resigning Monday. Harris will not give a farewell speech on the Senate floor, due to the schedule. Harris won her seat in November 2016 and was sworn in January 2017. At the time, Harris was California\u2019s attorney general. Newsom has already named Alex Padilla, California\u2019s secretary of state, to fill Harris\u2019 seat. In a press call, he told reporters he would likely be sworn in himself on Wednesday. The incoming vice president has spoken to Padilla before he comes into office, according to a person with knowledge of the discussion. Harris made history throughout her career, becoming the first Black woman in California to serve as a senator. In her November victory speech, she recognized the hard battle women faced to exercise their civic rights and break into the upper echelon of American politics, nodding to the women who came before her like former Rep. Shirley Chisholm and the young girls who will come after her. \u201cWhile I may be the first woman in this office, I will not be the last,\u201d Harris said. \u201cBecause every little girl watching tonight sees that this is a country of possibilities.\u201d Now, Harris will preside over the same chamber that she is stepping down from, becoming president of the Senate. With the double Democratic victories in two Georgia Senate runoffs and a highly polarized Congress, Harris will have the power to push any legislation, judicial appointments and Cabinet nominations languishing on party lines over the threshold and take credit for helping pass the administration\u2019s priorities. As president of the Senate, she will cast the tie-breaking vote. But Harris aides say they hope Harris won\u2019t have to break many ties. \u201cWe believe that the issues that the Congress will have to take up are bipartisan issues that are of importance to the American people,\u201d one aide said. President-elect Joe Biden rolled out his first legislative priority this week, announcing a $1.9 trillion coronavirus relief package that included direct payments to Americans. Biden has emphasized he wants it to be the first issue Congress takes up after he is inaugurated on January 20. In a press call with reporters announcing the resignation, Harris aides pointed to the first time she worked on Capitol Hill in 1984. She interned for California Sen. Alan Cranston during her sophomore year of college at Howard University, a historically Black university. \u201cI loved going to work\u2014it felt like the epicenter of change, even as an intern sorting mail,\u201d Harris wrote in a tweet from her Senate account in January of last year. \u201cI now work in the exact Senate office where I once interned.\u201d Aides on the call outlined what they viewed as Harris\u2019 legislative victories, including the introduction of her Maternal CARE Act, the first bill in the Senate to specifically address racial disparities in maternal mortality, according a fact sheet, as well as several bipartisan efforts like the anti-lynching act cosponsored by Democratic Sen. Cory Booker of New Jersey and Republican Sen. Tim Scott of South Carolina, along with her election security bill with Republican Sen. James Lankford of Oklahoma. On Wednesday, Harris will be sworn in by Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor, according to a Harris aide. The vice president-elect will take her oath of office using two Bibles; one that previously belong to a former neighbor and family friend of Harris, Regina Shelton, and another that belonged to Thurgood Marshall, the first African American to serve on the Supreme Court, the aide said. When asked about who she will be thinking of, Harris has repeatedly said her late mother Shyamala Gopalan. \u201cI will be thinking about my mother, who is looking down from heaven,\u201d Harris told NPR this month. CNN\u2019s Dan Merica and Eric Bradner contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Federal law enforcement officials are warning that domestic extremists are likely more emboldened to carry out attacks on President-elect Joe Biden\u2019s upcoming inauguration and throughout 2021 after seeing the success of last week\u2019s siege on the US Capitol. The threat is further complicating an already monumental challenge facing law enforcement agencies tasked with securing Washington in the coming days. CNN has learned that federal law enforcement agencies, in a series of bulletins and calls with local partners this week, have issued an urgent call for assistance in securing the nation\u2019s capital as the inauguration nears, and painted a dire picture of potential threats leading up to January 20. State officials around the country are also ramping up security. In Oklahoma, House members were told not to come to the state capitol this weekend due to concerns about possible protests. Fencing has been erected around the Arizona state capitol \u201cout of an abundance of caution\u201d and Oregon State Police will be assisted by the National Guard as they deal with possible demonstrations. Those concerns are bolstered by new warnings from federal officials that last Wednesday\u2019s attack on the US Capitol by supporters of President Donald Trump will likely motivate additional follow-on attacks by extremists throughout 2021, according to an intelligence bulletin dated Wednesday and obtained by CNN. Warning that the people who attacked the Capitol largely viewed their efforts as a success, the FBI, Department of Homeland Security and Office of the Director of National Intelligence said the attack \u201cvery likely will serve as a significant driver of violence\u201d for a diverse set of domestic extremists, according to the bulletin. The joint US government intelligence bulletin was first reported by The New York Times. \u201cThe violent breach of the US Capitol Building is very likely part of an ongoing trend in which (extremists) exploit lawful protests, rallies, and demonstrations, and other gatherings to carry out ideologically-motivated violence and criminal activity,\u201d the intelligence bulletin warned. The range of potential future targets of attack was varied, with intelligence officials warning in the bulletin that extremists could zero-in on government officials and institutions, as well as racial and religious minorities, journalists and members of the LGBTQ+ community. The bulletin also indicated that the January 6 attack may have served as a venue for extremists of differing ideological motivations to foster connections. In addition to the perceived success of the January 6 Capitol attack, intelligence officials warned that the response by law enforcement could also motivate extremists to respond with violence, including at Biden\u2019s upcoming inauguration. \u201cSince the (Capitol attack), violent online rhetoric regarding the (inauguration) has increased, with some calling for unspecified \u2018justice\u2019 \u201d for a rioter shot by police inside the Capitol, the bulletin said. Other motivations for possible future attacks included anti-government views held by extremists, as well as grievances associated with the false narrative that the 2020 presidential election was stolen. \u201cThe increasing prevalence and influence of conspiracy theories based on a belief in the existence of global or \u2018deep state\u2019 actors who work to manipulate various social, political, and/or economic conditions of the United States very likely serves as a driver of some (extremist) violence,\u201d the report said. The conspiracy theory-laden language observed by US intelligence officials has often mirrored baseless claims made by Trump. Throughout his presidency, Trump has claimed without evidence that a nefarious group of \u201cdeep state\u201d actors have been secretly working to undermine his presidency, and he has continually spread disinformation about the integrity of the 2020 election. As law enforcement prepares to respond to upcoming protests before and during the inauguration, FBI Director Chris Wray and Senior Official Performing the Duties of the Deputy Secretary of Homeland Security Ken Cuccinelli held a call Wednesday with law enforcement leaders from around the country to provide a briefing on the nationwide threat picture relating to planned protests, according to a person briefed on the call. The source said the FBI briefed their law enforcement partners on intelligence reporting indicating protesters planned to conduct \u201cpeaceful, armed demonstrations\u201d in Washington, DC, and at state capitols around the US on January 17 to protest the results of the 2020 election. An FBI spokesperson confirmed the call, but did not provide additional details. As CNN previously reported, an internal FBI bulletin disseminated to law enforcement warned that \u201carmed protests\u201d were being planned at all 50 state capitols and the US Capitol in Washington in the days leading up to the inauguration. The FBI indicated federal law enforcement is currently working to identify any suspected extremists who may pose a threat at the planned armed demonstrations. On the call, FBI officials said they remain concerned about the prospect of extremists appearing at planned rallies and conducting violence, and that violent domestic extremists continue to pose the most significant threat to Biden\u2019s inauguration, according to another source familiar with the call. \u201cThe chatter is off the charts right now,\u201d one official told CNN on Tuesday regarding extremists talking online about future actions. Federal officials stressed on the call with state, local, tribal and college campus law enforcement leaders that the FBI will not tolerate extremists using the First Amendment as a guide to incite violence, adding that they expect threats will continue past Biden\u2019s inauguration, the source said. In addition to the potential threats at government buildings, officials discussed seeing an increased number of threats to private companies and their executives in recent days. According to the source, federal officials said on the call that Russian actors have been amplifying the false narrative that members of Antifa infiltrated Trump supporters during the riot at the US Capitol, and the Chinese have seized on news stories showing chaos in the US. Another government report is shedding light on how law enforcement officials are monitoring the threat of potential violence in the coming days. According to an internal US Secret Service report dated January 11 and obtained by CNN, analysts with the Secret Service\u2019s team responsible for monitoring websites and social media for planned demonstrations note that protesters unhappy with the 2020 election results are using online platforms to organize events in the Washington area and around the country. In one online forum observed by investigators, the report indicated that a group calling itself \u201cAmerican Patriots Nationwide\u201d is organizing a violent demonstration in Washington beginning on January 16. On its website, the group indicated it plans to use its members to surround the Capitol, White House and Supreme Court, and only allow the entry of people designated by Trump. The Secret Service report said the American Patriots Nationwide group also planned to detain Democratic politicians who \u201cplayed a role in planning or executing or supporting the attempted coup of the United States of America from 2016 to 2020.\u201d The Secret Service bulletin did not offer an assessment on the realistic nature of the planned rallies nor how much confidence investigators have in the ability of organizers to achieve their stated objectives. According to the report, groups associated with the Boogaloo movement planned to host an armed march from the Washington Monument to the White House, and encouraged its members to bring weapons. Other separate events noted in the Secret Service report similarly encouraged protest attendees to come armed, although organizers did not explicitly encourage violence. The District of Columbia has some of the strictest gun laws in the country and the open carrying of firearms is prohibited. For Inauguration Day, the Secret Service report indicated that analysts identified more than 35 rallies being planned online around Washington. One event dubbed the Million Militia March encouraged attendees to bring weapons. \u201cThe group claims they will not attack, but will defend,\u201d the Secret Service report noted. As part of its protective mission, the Secret Service routinely reviews so-called \u201copen source intelligence\u201d to review planned rallies and protests staged near official events. The Secret Service report obtained by CNN indicated that recent efforts by social media companies to suspend users engaged in election-related disinformation has, in effect, hindered the ability of analysts to identify some details of planned inauguration protests. Not all of the planned demonstrations listed in the Secret Service report were pro-Trump. According to analysts, one group is planning a rally called \u201cSmoking to Trump\u2019s Sorrow,\u201d in which attendees will join to together to smoke marijuana and celebrate the end of Trump\u2019s presidency. Another planned DC event, dubbed the \u201cLesbian U-Haul Trump Out Parade\u201d is being organized to help move Trump out of the White House, although the Secret Service did not indicate what logistics the group planned to employ to accomplish its stated goal.

            "article_content": "Mississippi Gov. Tate Reeves on Monday ratified the new state flag, and Mississippi flew its new banner over the state Capitol for the first time, months after the state retired its decades-old flag that displayed a Confederate battle emblem. The moment was historic for the southern state that had been the last in the nation whose flag featured the Confederate battle insignia, and emotional for advocates who fought for years to change it. The new \u201cIn God We Trust\u201d state flag, featuring a magnolia flower and stars, was approved by 73% of Mississippi voters in the November election. \u201cToday, we turn the page. We commit our former flag to history, and we commit ourselves to the business of the future. It is one small effort to unify, but it is done in good faith,\u201d Reeves, a Republican, said in remarks prior to ratifying the new state flag. \u201cIn Mississippi, there has been a prominent roadblock to unity. When many look at our former flag, they just saw a symbol of the state and heritage they loved. But many felt dismissed because of that flag. That is not a firm foundation for our state.\u201d Reeves and other Mississippi leaders later gathered on the steps of the state Capitol to watch their new state flag be hoisted ceremoniously above the seat of the state\u2019s government. It was a contrasting moment just days after a Confederate flag, a divisive symbol of slavery and white supremacy, had been carried in the halls of the US Capitol in Washington, DC, for the first time during last week\u2019s insurrection. In prayer Monday after the flag was raised, Reeves noted that it\u2019s \u201ca time of divisiveness in our country,\u201d but added that \u201cwe are united in our state on a path forward.\u201d This past summer, the sentiment toward the old Mississippi flag appeared to shift amid racial reckoning over the death of George Floyd, a Black man killed in Minneapolis police custody. Protests over Floyd\u2019s death reignited the debate over the nation\u2019s remaining Confederate monuments and symbols, including Mississippi\u2019s state flag. Amid the protests, Mississippi state lawmakers passed a historic referendum to retire and replace the flag with a new design that \u201cshall honor the past while embracing the promise of the future.\u201d The bill established a commission to select a new design that would exclude the Confederate battle emblem and include the phrase \u201cIn God We Trust.\u201d In September, the commission selected the magnolia flag as the design Mississippi voters would consider on the November ballot. During the flag raising ceremony Monday, state House Speaker Philip Gunn, a Republican, spoke of what motivated some hesitant lawmakers to ultimately vote to change the flag. \u201cIt was their families. It was knowing that history was going to record what they did and they did not want their spouses, or their children, or their grandchildren to be disappointed in them. They wanted their children and grandchildren to be proud of them, the future generations of this state to be proud of what they did,\u201d he said. The old Mississippi state flag, adopted in 1894, flew for the last time on July 1, before it was officially retired and brought to the Mississippi Department of Archives and History. The new state flag features a magnolia flower, a symbol of hospitality, surrounded by 20 stars, signifying Mississippi\u2019s status as the 20th state in the union, and a gold five-point star to reflect Mississippi\u2019s indigenous Native American tribes.

            "article_content": "The progressive group Justice Democrats is throwing their support behind former Ohio state Sen. Nina Turner, a top ally of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, in her campaign to succeed Ohio Rep. Marcia Fudge, who is poised to join President-elect Joe Biden\u2019s cabinet. Fudge was nominated by Biden in December to lead the Department of Housing and Urban Development. Pending her confirmation, the heavily Democratic northeast Ohio district will hold a special election later this year. The race to fill Fudge\u2019s seat has already attracted two other candidates \u2013 Cuyahoga County Democratic Party chairwoman Shontel Brown, who is also a member of the county council, and former Cleveland City Councilor Jeff Johnson \u2013 and is shaping up as the first major test of the left\u2019s electoral power in the Biden era. Justice Democrats\u2019 endorsement will brighten the spotlight and add new grassroots fundraising might to Turner\u2019s bid, which already has the backing of Sanders and a number of leading progressive organizations. It could also help consolidate progressives behind Turner with former Ohio congressman and Cleveland Mayor Dennis Kucinich, a two-time presidential candidate, saying he might consider a run. Justice Democrats, which recruited New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez ahead of her 2018 victory and led the charge in 2020 for freshman Reps. Cori Bush of Missouri, Jamaal Bowman of New York and Marie Newman of Illinois \u2013 all of whom ousted Democratic incumbents on their way to Congress \u2013 recently began recruiting candidates for the 2022 election cycle. \u201cWe are so proud to support Nina Turner because she has stood with our progressive movement since Day 1,\u201d Justice Democrats Executive Director Alexandra Rojas said in a statement. \u201cShe has a strong public service record of fighting to uplift working-class people and deliver justice. We know Senator Turner will help create a mission-driven team in Congress to deliver relief during this pandemic and fight for Medicare for All, a Green New Deal, racial justice, and getting big money out of politics.\u201d In a video released Monday, Turner \u2013 who has been allied with the group for years and addressed potential candidates, including Ocasio-Cortez, at an early gathering back in 2017 \u2013 said she is \u201cproud to call myself a Justice Democrat\u201d and pledged to \u201ctake this fight from Ohio\u2019s 11th District to the halls of Congress.\u201d A former Cleveland city councilor who was appointed to the state senate in 2008 and reelected in 2010 before losing a race for secretary of state four years later, Turner was endorsed by Sanders shortly after she entered the race. \u201cI\u2019ve gotten to know Nina Turner over the last five years. She deeply cares for working families and she has the heart to be an effective, unwavering fighter for them in Congress,\u201d Sanders said in December. Turner led Our Revolution, the outside group that grew out of Sanders\u2019 2016 campaign, before taking a leave of absence to become a co-chair of his 2020 run. She also served as a delegate for former President Barack Obama at the 2008 and 2012 Democratic National Conventions. California Rep. Ro Khanna, Bush and Minnesota Attorney General Keith Ellison have also endorsed Turner.",

            "article_content": "Nsenga Burton grew up in a military family that liked to travel and went everywhere from New York City and Washington, D.C., to the Caribbean. There was one place, though, that her mother dreaded visiting: the Deep South. Her mother saw it as a forbidding land of lynch mobs and \u201cWhites Only\u201d signs, where Black people went missing just for trying to vote. Burton\u2019s mother grew up in segregated Virginia and was so mistrustful of the South she once dissuaded her daughter from vacationing in Atlanta and encouraged her to visit the Bahamas instead. \u201cMy mother sent me out of the country before she sent me to the Deep South,\u201d Burton says. Burton, who is 48, just got a little payback. After moving to Atlanta from Maryland six years ago, she became part of a crucial bloc of Black voters who helped Democrats seize control of the US Senate. They mobilized in record numbers to elect the Rev. Raphael Warnock, a Black man from Savannah, and Jon Ossoff, a Jewish man from Atlanta. Burton thought of all the Black people like her who migrated from elsewhere to Georgia to reclaim political power that was taken away from their parents and grandparents, who fled the Jim Crow South in fear. \u201cIt\u2019s poetic justice,\u201d says Burton, a cultural critic and founder of The Burton Wire, which produces stories on race, class, and gender. \u201cThe descendants of the people who were pushed out of the South, who had no power, who knew they could go missing if they tried to vote, have returned and they\u2019re making it work for them. It\u2019s been a long time coming.\u201d The stunning election results in Georgia have rightly been attributed to the relentless work of voting-rights organizers such as Stacey Abrams, the former gubernatorial candidate whose group, Fair Fight, is credited with registering 800,000 new voters in Georgia. But those victories also happened because of a series of personal decisions made years ago by little-known transplants like Burton. They are part of what\u2019s called \u201cThe New Great Migration,\u201d and without them, Warnock and Ossoff wouldn\u2019t have stood a chance. More than a million Black people have moved to Georgia and other Southern states in the last 30 years. Many have started to flex political powers that were denied to their ancestors. They\u2019re not just winning local races for mayor and city council, they\u2019re shaping national politics. What happened in Georgia this week is a culmination of this trend. Some trace the shift to President Obama\u2019s successful 2008 presidential run, when he won Virginia and North Carolina. Others cite a multiracial progressive movement called Moral Mondays that turned North Carolina from a red state into a political battleground. The Rev. William Barber II, an activist and author, is credited with helping transform North Carolina into a place where the GOP cannot take victory for granted. The state now has a Democratic governor. Barber, 57, says the Democratic victories in Georgia can spread throughout the South if candidates are not afraid to run on an unabashedly progressive platform, as Warnock and Ossoff did, that champions the working class. \u201cGeorgia doesn\u2019t have to be an anomaly,\u201d says Barber, whose parents moved to North Carolina from Indiana. \u201cGeorgia literally shows what\u2019s possible when you put messaging, mobilization, and the investment of money in there.\u201d   He points out, though, that the newfound Black political clout in Georgia is not unprecedented. It\u2019s a return to what he calls \u201cfusion politics\u201d \u2013 a late 19th-century movement that saw Blacks and progressive Whites change politics throughout the South. Much of this progress occurred during Reconstruction, that period when Black and White voters in the South sent two Black senators to the US Senate and elected more than 2,000 Black congressmen, judges, sheriffs and tax collectors. \u201cA superficial political analysis will say that the Black vote elected Warnock and Ossoff, but a serious political analysis will say that Black, White and Latino voters elected them,\u201d Barber says. Any serious political analysis of the Democrats\u2019 victories in Georgia must also examine Atlanta\u2019s mythical hold on Black America. The New Great Migration gave Ossoff and Warnock a more level playing field, because Atlanta has long been a top destination for Black transplants from around the country. In the 1970s, Ebony and Jet magazines promoted Atlanta as the \u201cBlack Mecca\u201d of the South because of its vibrant middle class,  renowned Black colleges like Morehouse and Spelman, and its string of popular Black mayors like Maynard Jackson and Andrew Young. It\u2019s also been called the \u201ccradle of the civil rights movement\u201d as the birthplace of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., who used the city as a home base to change the nation. Voters in Atlanta and its predominantly Black suburbs were crucial to Warnock and Ossoff\u2019s victories, and many of these voters came from elsewhere. In 2019, 43% of eligible Black voters in Georgia were born outside of the state, according to the Pew Research Center. In the Atlanta metro area, 76% of eligible Black voters were born outside of Georgia. Many of these Black transplants came because they didn\u2019t have the same fear of the South as their parents. They got active in politics and civic affairs and become what Burton calls \u201csupervoters\u201d: people who vote in local, state and national elections. \u201cIf there\u2019s an election for a dog catcher, supervoters are going to vote in it,\u201d Burton says. They\u2019re people like Charles M. Blow, the New York Times columnist, who moved to Atlanta from New York City a year ago. \u201cI chose Atlanta because many of my friends were already there, having moved to the \u2018hot\u2019 Southern city after college, and because I saw Georgia as on the cusp of transformational change,\u201d Blow wrote in a recent column. \u201cI say to Black people: Return to the South, cast down your anchor and create an environment in which racial oppression has no place.\u201d But across the South, Black political power outside of Georgia is still uneven. Black voters in South Carolina helped send Biden to the White House when they threw their support behind his then-floundering campaign during the Democratic primaries. But they have not changed the White Republican dominance of their state. Mississippi is a textbook example of why a large Black populace doesn\u2019t necessarily translate into political power. It has the highest percentage of Black people in any state \u2013 about 38% \u2013 but they are virtually locked out the state\u2019s political power.  It doesn\u2019t have Georgia\u2019s booming economy or its influx of multiracial, college-educated transplants who tend to be progressive voters. White Republicans have dominated state politics in Mississippi since the late 19th century. The segregated nature of Mississippi\u2019s politics is partly what led to the first Great Migration. Much of the South was an apartheid state where Blacks could lose their jobs or get killed for trying to vote. They could even be killed for whims such as \u201creckless eyeballing\u201d \u2013 looking at a White person the wrong way. That fear stayed with many Blacks long after they left the Deep South. \u201cMy mom still doesn\u2019t come here now, and she\u2019s from Virginia,\u201d says Burton, who lives in a suburb of Atlanta. An estimated six million Blacks left the South for the North between 1915 to 1970. They hopped on railway cars from states like Mississippi and Louisiana to head for factory jobs in cities like Chicago and Detroit. This epic migration was captured most memorably in a 2010 book by Isabel Wilkerson, \u201cThe Warmth of Other Suns.\u201d Wilkerson\u2019s book title is based on a poem by the Black author Richard Wright, who moved from the South to Chicago and wrote he was \u201ctaking a part of the South to transplant in alien soil,\u201d to \u201cbend in strange winds, respond to the warmth of other suns and, perhaps, to bloom.\u201d For many Black people in Georgia, part of the thrill of this week\u2019s victories is that they are finally seeing the political winds bend in their direction. Warnock is the first Black man ever elected to the Senate from Georgia. Until this week, Republicans held every statewide elective office and majorities in both houses of the legislature. Until last November, when Biden edged President Trump here, Georgia was a reliably red state. \u201cThere\u2019s no going back,\u201d said Jacquelyn Bettadapur, chairwoman of the Democratic Party in Cobb County, a suburban Atlanta county that was once staunchly conservative. \u201cA Democrat would be a fool not to play in Georgia going forward.\u201d Warnock evoked this triumphant mood when he cited his 82-year-old mother, the Rev. Verlene Warnock, who spent her summers picking cotton and tobacco in the fields of southern Georgia. \u201cBecause this is America,\u201d he said, \u201cthe 82-year-old hands that used to pick somebody else\u2019s cotton went to the polls and picked her youngest son to be a United States senator.\u201d And because this is America, one Black man in Atlanta couldn\u2019t help but think this week of an American hero who saw the best and worst of the nation. Bernard Lafayette was friends with John Lewis, the former civil rights icon who died last July. As a longtime civil rights activist, Lafayette was also friendly with the Rev. C.T. Vivian and the Rev. Joseph Lowery, two other giants of the civil rights movement who also died in 2020. All three men were fixtures in Atlanta and around Georgia. None of them lived to see Warnock elected. Lafayette, 80, was particularly close to Lewis. The two men were college roommates and risked their lives as leaders of the student sit-in movements of the early 1960s and the Freedom Rides, the movement to desegregate interstate bus travel. Lafayette said he received a call from Lewis just five days before he died. The weakened congressman said to him, \u201cI just wanted to hear your voice.\u201d When Lafayette heard about this week\u2019s dual Democratic victories in Georgia, he thought of his departed friend. \u201cJohn Lewis would have been very elated,\u201d he says. \u201cHe\u2019s smiling right now and celebrating.\u201d So are many other Black residents of Georgia. But some of that elation is tempered by what may come. During the same week that Black voters in Georgia delivered the Senate to Democrats, the Republican-controlled Georgia legislature proposed laws that would make it harder to vote. They said they wanted to prevent voter fraud, even though no credible evidence of widespread voter fraud has been found. But Burton says Black voters in Georgia won\u2019t turn back now. They have a taste of national political power. Many are already gearing up for what they expect to be the next big contest: Abrams running for Georgia governor in 2022 in a potential rematch with Gov. Brian Kemp, who narrowly beat her in a controversial 2018 race. \u201cWhat\u2019s next? Stacey in the governor\u2019s mansion,\u201d Burton says. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to let up.\u201d Burton and other Black voters will have plenty of company. As more Black Americans return to cities like Atlanta, they will continue to reshape politics in the South. They will join people like Burton who no longer need to go North, like their ancestors, to feel the warmth of other suns. The message they sent from this week\u2019s Georgia runoff election is simple: Our political power is starting to bloom again.",

            "article_content": "A new Democratic-controlled Senate boosts the chances Supreme Court Justice Stephen Breyer, 82, would retire this year and offer new President Joe Biden an early opportunity to put his imprint on America\u2019s high court. Breyer, who before becoming a judge was chief counsel to the Senate Judiciary Committee, knows better than most how last week\u2019s surprise Georgia election has transformed the prospects for Biden to fulfill a progressive agenda related to the judiciary. The Supreme Court is controlled by a 6-3 conservative-liberal majority. So replacing Breyer, currently the eldest justice, with another liberal would not alter the 6-3 dynamic or diminish the force of the three justices President Donald Trump installed on the right wing. Joe Biden's new chief of staff knows how to get a Supreme Court justice confirmed Still, a Biden choice would enhance the diversity and youth of the bench and open a new chapter for justices who have the last word on issues from abortion and LGBTQ rights, religious liberties and racial remedies, to federal power and corporate regulation. President-elect Biden has vowed to name the first Black woman to the bench. When he initially made the pledge during a February 2020 debate in Charleston, he said, \u201cI\u2019m looking forward to making sure there\u2019s a Black woman on the Supreme Court, to make sure we in fact get every representation.\u201d Among such candidates could be US district court judge Ketanji Brown Jackson, 50, in Washington, DC, a former law clerk of Justice Breyer. Another possibility would be California Supreme Court justice Leondra Kruger, 44. Other Black women of varying backgrounds would no doubt be in the mix if a vacancy arises. Breyer, named by President Bill Clinton in 1994, declined to respond to questions related to any retirement plans. Breyer is known for many off-bench pursuits, including an enthusiasm for architecture, and he has authored several books related to law and regulation. Such outside interests, along with the new Democrat dynamic in the nation\u2019s capital, might induce him to leave the bench, perhaps as soon as this summer when the current 2020-21 session ends. His new book to be published this year, \u201cAgainst Segregation in America\u2019s Schools,\u201d could be his valedictory. It explores retrenchment on school integration today and is tied to one of Breyer\u2019s leading opinions for justices on the left. In 2007, he wrote a dissenting opinion to Chief Justice John Roberts\u2019 view that school districts could not consider a student\u2019s race when making school assignments as a way to integrate districts. \u201cThis is a decision that the Court and the Nation will come to regret,\u201d Breyer wrote, adding that the court\u2019s action in the Seattle case \u201cwould break (the) promise\u201d of the 1954 Brown v. Board of Education, which struck down the doctrine of \u201cseparate but equal.\u201d Justice Breyer on revisiting the death penalty Breyer is attuned to the politics of judicial confirmations and the dicey calculations involved in retirement decisions. He was a lead counsel in the 1970s to Massachusetts Democratic Sen. Ted Kennedy, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee. A Breyer departure this year would lead to the first successful Democratic appointee since 2010, when the Senate confirmed President Barack Obama\u2019s nominee Elena Kagan. Justices are seated for life, and long after a president leaves office, his legacy and priorities live on in the law. Trump\u2019s three justices represented a significant achievement, especially for a one-term president. But Trump\u2019s 2017 appointment of Neil Gorsuch was possible only because the Republican-led Senate refused to consider Obama\u2019s 2016 nomination of Merrick Garland to replace the late Justice Antonin Scalia. Supreme Court backs religious groups against Covid-19 restrictions in Colorado and New Jersey As it happens, Garland, the chief judge of the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit since 1997, will have another chance for a Senate vote. President-elect Biden has named Garland his nominee to lead the Justice Department as attorney general. The Scalia/Garland fight in the Senate was the first of a series of contentious succession battles on the nine-member bench that culminated in October with Trump\u2019s appointment of Justice Amy Coney Barrett to succeed pioneering liberal Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg. In addition to Barrett and Gorsuch, Trump named Justice Brett Kavanaugh in 2018. The other Republican appointees are Chief Justice Roberts and Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito. The third Democratic appointee, with Breyer and Kagan, is Justice Sonia Sotomayor. Ginsburg, Breyer\u2019s fellow Clinton appointee, rejected pressure to retire while Obama was in office. \u201cSo tell me who the President could have nominated this spring that you would rather see on the court than me?\u201d she said in a 2014 interview, evoking the complicated politics already underway in Obama\u2019s second term. She died on September 18, four months before the end of the Trump tenure. 20 years of closed-door conversations with Ruth Bader Ginsburg Biden will separately fill scores of lower court appointments in the next four years, including the vacancy that would occur through Garland\u2019s departure from the DC Circuit. That bench is often called the nation\u2019s \u201csecond highest court\u201d because of its important docket testing government powers. A Biden appointment would not alter the ideological or political character of the bench, but it would enhance its diversity. Thomas is currently the only Black member of the court; Justice Sotomayor was the first Latina justice named. The average age of the current justices is 63; the three youngest and those with the potential to most influence the law in upcoming decades are Gorsuch, 53, Kavanaugh, 55, and Barrett, 48. Supreme Court's liberals face a new era of conservative dominance Biden was a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee when Breyer was a chief counsel. Biden later became the committee chairman and in 1994 oversaw Breyer\u2019s confirmation hearing for the Supreme Court. Biden referred to that service when he opened the session nearly 27 years ago, and Breyer responded in kind, \u201cWorking here on this committee in the 1970s, I learned a great deal about Congress, about government and about political life.\u201d",

We asked our viewers how they felt as they watched the chaotic scenes of a pro-Trump mob breaching the nation\u2019s Capitol on January 6. Usually a ceremonial day \u2013 with little fanfare in previous years \u2013 when Congress meets to certify the results of the election. Now, a day that will go down as one of the darkest in America\u2019s history. We received more than 7,000 responses. Here\u2019s a snapshot of what you told us. Along with tears and anger, many of our viewers told us January 6 is a day they won\u2019t forget. Pam B., Effort, Pennsylvania \u201cThe saddest and most upsetting day regarding our country, in my lifetime. Our democracy was at stake, and the sitting president supported all of this. I was angry, afraid, but mostly angry. That nobody reined this President in months/years prior to this says a lot about the Republicans\u2019 inability to be objective. And yesterday was the icing on the cake. How many lives must be threatened before Trump is stopped? I live in a great amount of fear now \u2026 as the emotions of the people rioting will, no doubt, trickle down to residents in my community.\u201d Janet B., Las Vegas, Nevada \u201cI was watching the confirmation process and saw the Capitol, MY Capitol, being stormed. I told my husband that, after watching many movies with foreign agents attacking the White House, I never expected to see so-called Americans attacking. We wept.\u201d Ken A., Memphis, Tennessee \u201cI am so totally disgusted and disappointed. So many people I know and consider friends, are in total support of Trump. They consider the people who invaded the Capitol as patriots and that the election was a fraud. Things will never be the same.\u201d Jake, Indianapolis \u201cMy wife calls me a robot because I don\u2019t show my emotions very often. Yesterday, on my drive home, I was so angry with the terrorists who desecrated our Temple of Liberty, I cried. This was almost as surreal as 9/11. I was texting with my British friend who, along with his wife, just became permanent residents. I apologized to him for what he was seeing. This is the United States of America. We do not act this this. We are the example to the world of what freedom and democracy look like. Not by screaming, or bravado, or force, but by going about our business and letting our normal be how we show the world \u2026 this is how it is done, this is who we are. Yesterday, we lost this. Yesterday, America failed.\u201d The overwhelming majority of our viewers hold President Trump responsible for what happened and want him removed from office. Michael S., Cornwall, Vermont \u201cI watched in horror. Trump is a traitor, MAGA and the Proud Boys (etc.) are domestic terrorists, and much of the GOP is complicit. Trump should resign or be removed from office immediately. A criminal madman should not have access to nuclear weapons.\u201d Annie A., Scarborough, Maine \u201cI would like to see Trump immediately removed from office via the 25th Amendment. Then I would like him impeached so that he can never run for or hold office again. Finally I would like him prosecuted for the \u201ctoo many to count\u201d violations of federal and state law. Hopefully this will result in his going to prison. To do nothing and not hold him accountable will be the downfall of our democracy.\u201d Nathan, Michigan \u201cI was shocked by what I saw from the rioters and the President. I view the people that stormed the Capitol as traitors and non-Americans. I hope as many of the rioters will be arrested and prosecuted to the fullest extent. The President Trump should be stripped of his powers and never be allowed to hold a public office again. I am so disgusted with him and the mob.\u201d Beca, San Antonio, Texas \u201cTrump needs to be removed from office and charged for his crimes against our democracy now! This has gone on far too long. I\u2019m feeling scared and heartbroken that our country has fallen so low that we can\u2019t get along because so many are brainwashed by a weak leader who wishes to do harm.\u201d Trump is not alone. Many of you blamed lawmakers, too, and want them held to account as well. Arnold R., California \u201cSenators and Congressmen who have supported Trump must be removed from office NOW!\u201d Rick, Dallas, Texas \u201cThis is an unprecedented attack in our democracy. This is so surreal how this President has made a mockery of our most sacred institutions including the peaceful transfer of power. I am a lifelong Republican who for the first time voted Democrat in 2020. I do not recognize my party. We need to Invoke the 25th Amendment and remove this President. The GOP needs to prove that they are a party that puts its citizens and sacred democracy ahead of any individual. This is a very transparent moment for the GOP, we will see in the next few days where their priorities lie. This administration has exploited the political ignorance of the mob for too long. Let them splinter and isolate themselves in full view as insurgents and traitors.\u201d Tammy H., St. Charles, Missouri \u201cI am a Missourian and devout Republican. I voted for Josh Hawley. Many of my friends did. We will not make the same mistake again.\u201d Frizzell, Washington, DC, \u201cThis could have been prevented [if] all of the spineless GOP had stood up to Trump at the beginning. They created the monster and then set him upon America. Anything they did now will never excuse their choice of power over country. They need to be held accountable for the sedition that occurred.\u201d Janice R., Seymour, Tennessee \u201cEvery one of the persons who stormed the Capitol needs to be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law. True Trumpists are a lost cause. But I hope that the events of January 6 have made every person who voted for Trump in 2016, believing for some unfathomable reason that he was \u201cthe lesser of two evils,\u201d is ashamed and regretful today. They did as much as Trump and as much as the Trump cultists to cause this.\u201d Many of you viewed the police inaction as hypocritical in comparison to the treatment of Black Lives Matter protesters in the summer of 2020. Jai H., Baton Rouge, Louisiana \u201cThe riots that happened [Wednesday] were reprehensible. We have seen the warning signs over and over again the last few years since Trump\u2019s election. I am appalled that those non-patriotic rioters were allowed to casually storm into the people\u2019s house and loot, destroy property, endanger lives and face no consequences at all. From what I understand, minimal arrests were made for curfew violations but nothing more. Those rioters had access to sensitive information in the offices of lawmakers and even [got] away with mail, laptops and even signs and podiums with no repercussions for the law enforcement there. The difference in treatment between this mob and the peaceful protests from the Black Lives Matter protesters are blatantly apparent and disgusting. I would like answers.\u201d Liz H., Austin, Texas \u201cI\u2019m exhausted. Beyond angry. Disgusted and so tired of the racial double standards. Last summer protesters were tear gassed shot arrested in huge numbers for being on the street near the Capitol. These people pushed into the Capitol or were let in, looted and vandalized our public property and then just went home! Now the FBI can\u2019t figure out who these punks are? They\u2019re all over Twitter bragging but the FBI doesn\u2019t have enough video to locate them? We are a global laughingstock! Iran and China are schooling us on democracy! We\u2019ve watched Republicans lie and promote aggression with their constituents for months \u2026 riling them up until this happened. These so-called leaders put their own self-indulgence ahead of the people they swore to serve. It literally took having a gun held on them for them to acknowledge their hypocrisy.\u201d Kylie, Portland, Oregon \u201cAs a BIPOC youth, yesterday really showed the US\u2019s true colors. Seeing the Confederate flag, Nazi paraphernalia, clothing items that had racist and anti-Semitic paraphernalia, a noose and a guillotine allowed into the capitol both broke my heart and exposed the hypocrisy in the US. When people were protesting for civil rights and Black lives, they were met with police brutality, tear gas, rubber bullets etc., yet these terrorists who not only breached multiple lines of security, broke into the Capitol and vandalized it. Black and Brown people in this country are shot for doing nothing in most situations, yet people will find ways to justify their murder. Jewish and Muslim youth ate targeted for practicing their faith, which people will try and justify using outdated disgusting stereotypes. Asian youth have experienced an exponential amount of hate crimes within the states recently due to the COVID-19 pandemic, and people will try and justify it. Yet when thousands of White supremacists, carrying symbols of hate and violence break into the capital they aren\u2019t given the same treatment. I\u2019ve grown up in Portland, Oregon, a city that had become infamous in regards to the deployment of the Feds back in July. Trump was so fast to deploy the Feds in Portland, yet he couldn\u2019t do the same yesterday. The worst part is this was 100% avoidable. If Trump and the 11 senators plus various House members did not perpetuate the conspiracy theory that the election was fraudulent, we wouldn\u2019t be in this situation. What a disgusting way to end the Presidency.\u201d Chris C., Dallas, Texas \u201cTo be honest, I don\u2019t know how to feel anymore. How can the President of the United States continue to severely damage and divide our country with no repercussions? Not a single BLM protester would\u2019ve made it into the chambers, alive! Capitol Hill\u2019s plaza would have been covered with rubber bullets and depleted gas canisters, such protesters would have been labeled as \u201cthugs.\u201d Meanwhile pro-Trump rioters with the intent of causing chaos off baseless accusations, on the order of the President, were met with zero resistance and acknowledged as \u201cgood people.\u201d Let\u2019s not forget about the corrupt elected officials in both the House and Senate that attempted to derail our democracy as a result of the President\u2019s baseless accusations till the very end; they are as guilty as these domestic terrorists and need to be removed from their seats as well as face charges for sedition! The American people are very lucky democracy prevailed \u2013 this time! But our system is broken. Elected officials are putting their own agendas, lust for power and control, over the American people. I\u2019m finding it very difficult to remain optimistic for the future as it\u2019s going to take longer than 4 years to clean up the devastating mess, both domestic and international, Trump and his allies created during his tenure.\u201d Along with fear, many of you described a sense of America\u2019s democracy being more fragile than you thought it was. Shana D., California \u201c[Wednesday\u2019s] attempted coup was one of the most terrifying things I have witnessed with the exception of 9-11. Within the last four years Trump has managed to tear down the democracy that we built, fought and died for. We have managed to hold onto our democracy by a razor thin margin and I pray that we can turn around our country before it is too late.\u201d Kim S., Gray, Tennessee \u201cI\u2019m frightened at what this administration has gotten away with. I\u2019m frightened by how gullible and uneducated our US citizens have become. I\u2019m frightened that we value personality over our laws and constitution. I\u2019m frightened that one evil-intentioned man can rise to the top of our political system to become President. I\u2019m frightened that the whole world is watching and that the rest of the evil in this world is seeing how divided and vulnerable we are now. I\u2019m afraid we\u2019ve lost our Democratic way \u2013 that we\u2019ve forgotten that being an American requires a personal responsibility to our Nation to be good caretakers of our laws, our words, and each other. I\u2019m frightened to be a US citizen for the first time in my life.\u201d Michael F., Albemarle, North Carolina \u201cWhen broadcasts of the insurrectionists came to my attention I was outraged for a few minutes but ended up with tears and sadness that any American would take part in any conduct being exhibited. I can\u2019t watch anything about this without getting completely choked up and shedding tears. I fear for my country if these abhorrent actions continue. The President is clearly delusional, still speaking of a stolen election he won by a landslide. All of this is traceable back to his proclamations and I feel it\u2019s time for us to say, \u201clock them up.\u201d Javier A., Alhambra, California \u201cFascism has come to America. All Americans of goodwill must stand against our old enemy, whether under the banner of White supremacy, Nazism, Confederacy, KKK or plain old racism. In all its manifestations, it is the enemy of democracy and freedom.\u201d David S., Jacksonville, Florida \u201cAs a veteran, sworn to protect the country from \u201call enemies foreign and domestic,\u201d I felt the domestic part was unnecessary and confusing. I understood domestic terrorism and considered attacks like the OK city bombing and 911 extremely unfortunate, but singular events. These events did little to threaten our democracy. If anything these events created resolve and unification. I never expected the biggest threat to be located in the White House. I told my family they will remember where they were for the rest of their lives. My parents have JFK, I have 911, my children have 1/6. Yesterday I learned a painful lesson about the founders\u2019 prescience and wisdom.\u201d Note: We have used only our viewers\u2019 first names and in most cases their last initials to protect their identities after previous incidents of harassment from people who disagree with the opinions they shared with CNN.",

            "article_content": "It was too little, too late, and may fail to save a presidency imploding at staggering speed under the weight of Donald Trump\u2019s tragic flaws. Late in the final act of his tumultuous administration, the President finally admitted the reality of his political demise Thursday, suddenly surrounded by calls for his resignation, a staff exodus, potential criminal liability and concern over his mental state. The threat of a second impeachment was gaining momentum Friday morning, as more House Democrats signed on to the idea, even if a Senate trial appears inconceivable so close to Inauguration Day. In a scripted, stilted video, Trump condemned the mayhem unleashed by his supporters in the US Capitol and admitted unequivocally \u2013 more than two months after his election loss \u2013 that he will no longer be president in 12 days. But presidents don\u2019t get credit for pledging a \u201csmooth, orderly and seamless transition of power\u201d after encouraging their mobs to punish another branch of government and doing everything possible to destabilize the nascent administrations of their successors.   They can\u2019t get away with lurching into an \u201caddress on national healing,\u201d as the White House called his remarks, after spending two months subverting democracy by denying their election losses and spending four years shredding truth and inflaming cultural and racial divides for political gain. Given multiple reports about Trump\u2019s true, defiant state of mind, there is every reason to doubt the sentiments behind a prerecorded video message in which he never mentioned President-elect Joe Biden. In the past, the President has often used formal addresses to extricate himself from tough spots before revealing his true feelings on Twitter. There is also little doubt that Trump\u2019s video message was a desperate attempt to salvage his fast-declining political position after a disastrous day filled with outrage about his conduct and growing concerns about whether he is psychologically fit for office. \u201cI think that video was done only because almost all his senior staff was about to resign, and impeachment is imminent,\u201d a Trump adviser told CNN\u2019s Jim Acosta. Several disgusted senior aides have already quit over his seditious behavior \u2013 including Transportation Secretary Elaine Chao and Education Secretary Betsy DeVos. Others are staying only to keep the country on the rails over the next two weeks. Meanwhile, Trump\u2019s relationship with several of his top allies on Capitol Hill appears to be fraying. He engaged in a \u201cheated exchange\u201d with House GOP leader Kevin McCarthy, a stalwart ally, as rioters were overrunning the Capitol this week, a source briefed on the conversation told CNN\u2019s Phil Mattingly. The House minority leader was impressing on Trump the real-time severity of the situation and implored him to forcefully denounce the attackers, to which Trump demurred, leading to the back-and-forth. And Trump hasn\u2019t spoken to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell for weeks, sources say, as part of the fallout from the Kentucky Republican\u2019s acknowledgment last month that Biden won the presidency. Advisers to Vice President Mike Pence have been fielding inquiries about whether he would lead the Cabinet in invoking the 25th Amendment to declare Trump unfit for office. Pence, however, is unlikely to pursue the option, CNN has reported, since it is a highly complicated constitutional maneuver that Trump could counter and that would take up most of the waning days until Biden is inaugurated on January 20. But former White House chief of staff John Kelly told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper in a candid interview on Thursday that if he were still in the Cabinet he would advocate the President\u2019s removal. \u201cHe\u2019s a very, very flawed human being,\u201d Kelly told Tapper, after days in which the President\u2019s demagoguery, autocratic instincts, lack of compassion, assaults on truth and vanity have driven the nation to a breaking point.   In another barely believable move in the fast-escalating implosion of the presidency, Democratic House Speaker Nancy Pelosi of California and Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, a New York Democrat, issued a statement revealing that they had called Pence to discuss the 25th Amendment but had not yet heard back. \u201cThe President\u2019s dangerous and seditious acts necessitate his immediate removal from office,\u201d they said. Even the staunchly conservative editorial page of Rupert Murdoch\u2019s Wall Street Journal told Trump he should take personal responsibility and resign \u2013 a sign of his fracturing political power base. The Journal argued that it would be in everyone\u2019s interest, and preferable to impeachment or removal, if Trump \u201csimply goes quietly\u201d but left no doubt that it considered his actions on Wednesday impeachable. A second, unprecedented impeachment of a living president would normally be inconceivable. But in a way, such a scenario would be a fitting finale for the most lawless, turbulent presidency in history. When House Democrats on Friday hold their first full-caucus call since the attack on the US Capitol, they\u2019ll weigh the possibility of a swift vote on articles of impeachment against the President, sources told CNN. The drama comes amid fury and trauma on Capitol Hill over Trump\u2019s incitement of a mob that breached the Capitol for the first time since 1814 in rioting that left five people dead. The events of the past two days have spurred bipartisan concerns about Trump\u2019s increasingly vengeful mood and the damage he could wreak as he contemplates the end of his presidency and a transition to civilian life in which a flurry of legal challenges awaits. In essence, the rationale for the impeachment effort would be a stunning conclusion that America \u2013 and the world \u2013 is in peril if he remains in office even for little more than a week. And there\u2019s a long-term argument, since impeachment, if he were convicted, would bar Trump from holding public office in the future. A decision by House Democratic leaders to pursue an unprecedented second impeachment would find fertile evidence. It could be argued that Trump has committed several high crimes and misdemeanors in the last week alone, from his attempt to pressure Republican officials in Georgia to find voters to overturn his election loss to his goading of the Capitol attackers. What, for example, could be more contrary to Trump\u2019s oath to preserve, protect and defend the Constitution of the United States than inciting supporters who then sought to disrupt the lawful ceremony finalizing his successor\u2019s election? Federal investigators are looking at everyone involved in Wednesday\u2019s unrest, including the role Trump played in the mass rally that preceded the assault on the citadel of US democracy and left lawmakers and staff cowering in their chambers amid an appalling scene of mob rule. But a new impeachment push would face huge practical and political challenges with a high bar of convincing the country that ousting a President so close to the end of his term was in the national interest. House Democrats \u2013 who previously impeached Trump over his pressure on Ukraine to interfere in the US election to damage Biden \u2013 would face claims from some Republicans that they are seeking to exact political revenge at the end of Trump\u2019s term. And despite the widespread outrage across party lines over Trump\u2019s behavior, it still seems a stretch that proponents of impeachment would reach the necessary two-thirds majority in the Republican-led Senate to secure a conviction and ouster of the President. Then there are the logistical challenges built into compressing a process that normally takes months \u2013 includes long committee hearings, debates and a trial in the Senate \u2013 into a few days. There\u2019s the question of whether a final-days impeachment \u2013 which would serve as a warning to future presidents about the limits of their power \u2013 would only deepen the venomous divides that have been ripped open by Trump\u2019s presidency. Still, the overwhelming sentiment expressed in a discussion between Pelosi and her leadership team Thursday night was to move ahead with a quick impeachment vote, multiple sources tell CNN\u2019s Manu Raju. The view among most top Democrats, including Pelosi, was that Trump should be held accountable for his actions, though there were some dissenters who were concerned such a move could be perceived as an overreach. Biden is already facing multiple crises, including a murderous pandemic that has never been worse and on Thursday killed more than 4,000 Americans in one day \u2013 a record. The aftermath of an impeachment would likely make his all-but-impossible task of unifying the country even tougher. A person close to Biden told CNN\u2019s Jeff Zeleny that the President-elect has no appetite for opening an impeachment proceeding against the President. \u201cImpeachment would not help unify this country,\u201d the person said, while stressing that the matter was one for Congress to decide.

            "article_content": "The Democratic sweep of Georgia\u2019s Senate seats has ushered in a heady new reality for President-elect Joe Biden, who will take office in two weeks with a mandate to act and the numbers on Capitol Hill to deliver on some of his most ambitious promises. Freed from the constraints that soon-to-be Republican Minority Leader Mitch McConnell was poised to place on his agenda, Biden now also faces new pressure to act swiftly while keeping his narrow Democratic majorities in the House and Senate unified \u2013 a tricky task that could make or break his presidency in its first year. The party\u2019s wish list is long and every senator will effectively have veto power on each piece of legislation. But the early hurdles that many in the party were fretting over days ago fell overnight. With Vice President-elect Kamala Harris as the tie-breaking vote, Biden will now be able to confirm his Cabinet picks and future judicial nominees on party line votes, overturn rules put in place by agencies run by President Donald Trump\u2019s administration, and begin the work of crafting a major economic stimulus package on the scale desired by Democrats without being forced to negotiate for Republican support.   Instead, the leverage will shift to the left \u2013 but only as far as Senate moderates, who make up most of the new majority, allow it to go. The odds that Democrats pass big ticket progressive legislation is only fractionally greater than it was on Monday, with future Majority Leader Chuck Schumer either needing a united conference, or the support of GOP defectors, to make it happen. Liberal gains will likely happen on the margins, but with Biden pushing for a massive Covid relief package out of the gate, those gains could have outsized consequences. \u201cIt is impossible to overstate how important (Tuesday\u2019s) wins are for the Biden presidency. Everything was on the ballot in Georgia \u2013 the economy, healthcare, Covid, the courts,\u201d said Guy Cecil, chairman of Democratic super PAC Priorities USA. \u201cThis means real change won\u2019t be relegated to executive orders. Now, President Biden and Congressional Democrats need to deliver.\u201d Biden set the stakes during an eleventh hour campaign rally for the Reverend Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff, now Georgia\u2019s Democratic senators-elect, on Monday in Atlanta. \u201cIf you send Jon and the Reverend to Washington,\u201d Biden said, \u201cthose $2,000 (stimulus) checks will go out the door, restoring hope and decency and honor for so many people who are struggling right now.\u201d And he cheered the results on Wednesday, saying that \u201cGeorgia\u2019s voters delivered a resounding message\u201d and that \u201cthey want action on the crises we face and they want it right now.\u201d In a conciliatory note, Biden also emphasized that he was prepared to work with both Democrats and Republicans, naming a range of issues, from the coronavirus fight, to providing relief to struggling families, along with climate change, racial justice and voting rights. But Warnock and Ossoff\u2019s victories will have further reaching effects than the short-term imperative of combating the pandemic and its economic fallout. McConnell will no longer set the legislative agenda. Bills passed out of the House will, at the least, get a look from the Senate. Victory in Georgia will also embolden party progressives to lean harder on leadership to wield their unexpected new power. \u201cWhere as before (winning the Senate majority) we were going to need to put wind in the Democrats\u2019 sails to bring their fight to the American people and pressure Republicans, our work now is much more focused on pushing the Democrats to be bold and seize the possibility that exists in this moment,\u201d said Sunrise Movement political director Evan Weber. \u201cThis is a once in a generation opportunity to pass historic legislation to act on the major crises of our time, especially climate change, and we can\u2019t accept half measures.\u201d Democrats take control of the Senate For outside groups that worked in Georgia, the wins both validate the time and money they had poured into 2020 races and encourage them that issues they have long organized around could actually be addressed in the first two years of a Biden presidency. \u201cWinning the presidency took our country back from the brink of fascism. Now, we have the chance to move an agenda that actually changes people\u2019s lives,\u201d said Jess Morales Rocketto, a top operative for the National Domestic Workers Alliance. The group ran one of the largest voter contact programs in Georgia, a state they considered their flagship electoral challenge. \u201cThe Biden administration has the incredible opportunity to use this resounding Democratic mandate and make good on every campaign promise,\u201d Rocketto added, \u201cbut they have to do it on day one and without fear.\u201d Brian Lemek, the executive director of Brady PAC, the political arm of the oldest gun violence prevention organization, said you \u201ccan\u2019t understate the enormity of these two wins in Georgia.\u201d \u201cWhile the margins in both the House and the Senate are razor thin,\u201d said Lemek, \u201cthey give Biden and Democrats a tremendous upper hand and a real opportunity to pass meaningful legislation that improves the lives of millions of Americans.\u201d Back in December, during a virtual meeting with constituents in New York City, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer gave a glimpse into what he expected to happen if the party won back the chamber and he was elevated to majority leader. \u201cJoe Biden, I think, will introduce something similar to the Heroes Act, which is $3.4 trillion and deals with all the issues that you\u2019re talking about,\u201d Schumer said, addressing a question about economic aid to small businesses. \u201cAnd if I get the majority I will put it on the floor and it will pass. Because it only needs reconciliation, 51 votes.\u201d With Vice President-elect Harris \u2013 who could end up being a fixture on Capitol Hill in the coming months \u2013 as the tie-breaking vote in the Senate, Schumer has just that. But like Biden, he could also be facing a more difficult job in keeping his conference in lockstep. His majority comes with the finest possible margin and the New Yorker will need to carve out agreement across the party\u2019s ideological lines, from centrist Sens. Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema to progressives like Elizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders. As news of the Georgia victories began to sink in Wednesday on Capitol Hill, Senate Democrats began to discuss their priorities. Most said that a coronavirus relief bill topped the list, specifically one that includes $2,000 checks to many Americans. Beyond that, however, the next steps are slightly unclear. Action on climate change, structural racism and economic inequality all now seem closer within reach. Biden will likely set the agenda. \u201cWe need to fix a lot of the damage Trump\u2019s done and then there\u2019s pent-up demand for a whole lot of things. What do we do about climate and about racial inequality, about wealth inequality, about structural racism,\u201d said Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown. New York Rep. Jamaal Bowman, a progressive who was sworn-in for his first term on Sunday, said the Senate\u2019s swing toward Democrats, along with the split in the GOP over Trump\u2019s effort to overturn his election defeat, cleared a new, wider path to action. \u201cNow we can fight amongst ourselves within the Democratic Party and push for the policies that we know the majority of the American people want and need and demand,\u201d Bowman said. \u201cAnd quite frankly, I\u2019m going to be looking very closely at the Republicans who are not supporting the circus that Trump and some Republicans are trying to create today, because that may present opportunities for collaboration and true bipartisan leadership going forward.\u201d On the other side of the aisle, the blame game is in full swing. For Republicans who worked to control the Senate, the story in Georgia was one that repeated throughout the country: The suburbs rejected Donald Trump\u2019s GOP in 2018 and were a crucial piece of the Democratic coalition in 2020. Biden pulled significant support from one-time Republican strongholds, in part, because of Trump\u2019s erratic behavior and promotion of conspiracy theories. Republicans like Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp sought to combat the trend by appointing Loeffler to an open seat, believing that she could bring suburban Republicans \u2013 specifically women \u2013 back home. But Loeffler largely abandoned appeals to moderates and put her lot in with Trump, embracing his language and pledging to join Republicans in their electoral college stunt. As results became clear early Wednesday morning, a gloom fell over Republicans as the silver linings from the general election \u2013 when they picked up seats in the House and appeared to be on track to hold on to the Senate \u2013 were stripped away. \u201cWe are waking up to a very different Washington today than we did yesterday,\u201d said Matt Gorman, a longtime Republican operative who previously worked as a top spokesperson at the National Republican Congressional Committee. \u201cThis really changes everything for the next two years.\u201d Gorman acknowledged that Biden now can pick almost anyone he wants for his Cabinet and judicial appointments and that passing major legislative achievements just got a lot easier. \u201cI don\u2019t think Joe Biden is suddenly going to become Bernie Sanders,\u201d Gorman said, \u201cbut not having to go through Mitch McConnell for his agenda absolutely empowers him to go further to the left than he anticipated.\u201d CNN\u2019s Lauren Fox, Sarah Fortinsky, and Ali Zaslav contributed to this report",

            "article_content": "A version of this story appeared in CNN\u2019s What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here. The Capitol building hasn\u2019t been breached since the War of 1812, when British soldiers burned Washington. Wednesday it wasn\u2019t the British attacking the Capitol. It was President Donald Trump\u2019s fiercest supporters, stoked by the commander in chief himself. They left his speech to them at the White House and stormed the seat of the US Congress, where they halted the counting of electoral votes that will seal Joe Biden\u2019s victory in the 2020 election and push Trump from power. Lawmakers were evacuated. A woman was shot and died. The rhetorical coup Trump has been fomenting on Twitter and in public appearances got very real very quickly. Rep. Jason Crow, a Democratic congressman from Colorado who fought as an Army Ranger in Iraq and Afghanistan, described his shock at being trapped in the House chamber as police drew guns and barricaded people inside with furniture. He felt attacked in the center of American democracy. \u201cWe will not be intimidated. We will not be browbeat. We will continue doing our work. The people\u2019s work,\u201d he said. He pledged that lawmakers would finish counting the electoral votes Wednesday or Thursday. This insurrection will ultimately be contained. Republicans are already paying a price for their commitment to Trump. As his supporters were entering the House and Senate chambers, CNN projected Democrats will take control of the Senate with Jon Ossoff\u2019s victory over David Perdue in Georgia\u2019s Senate runoff. George W. Bush, the last previous Republican president, has spoken publicly very rarely since leaving office. On Wednesday, he rejected the insurrection in a strongly worded statement, although he didn\u2019t use Trump\u2019s name. Other Republicans \u2013 even including Trump allies like House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, who had planned to join in objecting to electoral votes \u2013 have already joined Democrats in condemning the violence. When the counting of electoral votes concludes, Biden\u2019s victory will be announced and finalized. But do not dismiss the enormity of this violent political disobedience. You could compare the treatment of these largely White rioters, carrying Trump flags, to the rioters who tarnished Black Lives Matter protests for racial justice over the summer. You could wonder why the National Guard was called to secure US cities back then, but rioters on Wednesday were allowed by Capitol Police to enter the seat of US government and interrupt the lawful end of their patron\u2019s time in office. The Pentagon made clear it\u2019s coordinating with local authorities, the Department of Justice and Vice President Mike Pence. The military didn\u2019t mention Trump, who called in the National Guard last summer to give him cover while he went to do a photo-op at a church across from the White House. What\u2019s certain is that the anger these seditious rioters feel will not just go away when Trump\u2019s loss becomes a reality. And so it\u2019s worth looking at failed coups of the past. Specifically, as the presidential historian Michael Beschloss and the former Republican strategist Steve Schmidt pointed out on Twitter, it\u2019s worth looking at November 1923. Adolf Hitler, inspired by Benito Mussolini\u2019s 1922 takeover of the government in Rome, tried to seize power in Bavaria and failed \u2013 an event now known as the Beer Hall Putsch.That obviously wasn\u2019t the end of Hitler. Although he was convicted of treason and spent a year in jail, his popularity grew as he regrouped and marshalled the Nazis to take over Germany in the years to come. A decade later, in 1933, he used the burning of the Reichstag, Germany\u2019s parliament building, to marshal public opinion against Communists, although there is evidence the fire was actually set by Nazis. Wednesday was always going to be the day of Trump\u2019s repudiation by Congress. But his lying about election fraud came back to haunt him in many ways, all at once. He single-handedly cost Republicans their Senate majority. His fevered bullying of GOP lawmakers hit its limit as some GOP lawmakers chose truth and Biden over his fictions. And his effort to find ways around the Constitution finally unleashed a spectacle that alarmed and horrified even those who have worked for or have been supporting him along the way. The planes are all still landing. The House and Senate must finish the ceremonial counting of electoral votes that was interrupted by protesters. The twin Georgia races will ultimately be certified, and Raphael Warnock, the former preacher at MLK Jr.\u2019s Ebenezer Baptist Church will replace the appointed Republican Sen. Kelly Loeffler while Jon Ossoff will succeed Sen. David Perdue. Loeffler is a case study in Trump\u2019s toxic effect on the GOP.  She was selected by Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp because as a successful and relatively moderate businesswoman she could appeal to suburban women in the state. But she mainlined Trumpism during her time in Washington and ran a campaign of fealty to his wishes, including her possible objection to her own state\u2019s electoral votes when the counting continues. No matter. Many Republicans will, finally, join Democrats to uphold the Constitution and respect the voters and complete Biden\u2019s election. Pence, who Trump has cast off for not abetting his coup, released a statement explaining he would not deny Biden\u2019s election. Those Republicans should be applauded. But this took way too long. It should not take an actual attempted coup by a would-be strongman president to get adult lawmakers to do the right thing. Trump did eventually release a video statement Wednesday calling for peace. But he laced it with lies about the election, repeating it was stolen from him even though it was not. He later called the rioters \u201cgreat patriots.\u201d Twitter, in response, locked his account Wednesday, robbing him \u2013 for 12 hours \u2013 of his primary megaphone. The company also warned for the first time that it may suspend him permanently. So what\u2019s the accountability for Trump\u2019s insurrection? Vermont Republican Gov. Phil Scott said Trump should face consequences. \u201cThe fabric of our democracy and the principles of our republic are under attack by the President. Enough is enough. President Trump should resign or be removed from office by his Cabinet, or by the Congress,\u201d he said on Twitter. Impeach? Trump could be impeached again, as some \u2013 including the conservative Bill Kristol \u2013 argue. It would preclude him from federal office in the future. That\u2019s an important feature, but it would take time and Trump has two weeks left in office. A quicker end to Trump\u2019s presidency could be instigated by Pence, who has the power under the 25th Amendment to move for Trump\u2019s removal for being unfit. Pence would either need a majority of Trump\u2019s Cabinet, depleted by firings and resignations, or the majority of a panel empowered by Congress. Those things could take time. The presidential historian Douglas Brinkley said he never expected to be talking seriously about using the 25th Amendment on a US President. \u201cOur country\u2019s being held hostage right now by Donald Trump,\u201d he said. \u201cMitch McConnell and Speaker Pelosi cannot even meet in the Capitol today \u2026 so I think we now have to go into our Constitutional kit bag and find what we can do to control Donald Trump and certainly the 25th Amendment is there.\u201d CNN\u2019s Van Jones argued during the midst of the riot that these political rioters were committing treason, which we should point out is a crime that can be punishable by death. Harsher punishments. Here are the definitions of some possible subversive activities in US law (or read them for yourself here): We won\u2019t include the entire thing here since it is much longer, but there\u2019s also \u201cadvocating overthrow of government.\u201d",

            "article_content": "As a fellow Morehouse College graduate, Patrick Delisser feels inspired by Rev. Raphael Warnock\u2019s historic Senate victory. Delisser, a 32-year-old urgent care doctor, said Warnock embodies the will of Black men and HBCU graduates to beat the odds. \u201cThis is an exciting time, this is monumental,\u201d said Delisser, who is also Warnock\u2019s Alpha Phi Alpha Fraternity brother. \u201cHBCUs put us in positions that people aren\u2019t aware of, and Warnock shows people what we can achieve.\u201d Delisser is among the Black Georgia voters celebrating Warnock and fellow Democrat Jon Ossoff flipping two Senate seats that will give Democrats control of the Senate since Vice president-elect Kamala Harris will have the tie-breaking vote. Warnock and Ossoff will be the first Black and Jewish senators, respectively, to represent Georgia. Supporters and organizers were optimistic that Democrats gaining control of the Senate would result in passing legislation that benefits Black Americans. Black voters say they want to see racial justice, police accountability, expanded health care access and an end to the Covid-19 pandemic, which has disproportionately impacted Black communities. Warnock and Ossoff campaigned on ending the coronavirus crisis in order to reopen the economy. They also pushed for debt-free public college and a new Voting Rights Act. Grassroots organizers also rejoiced Wednesday after Warnock\u2019s and Ossoff\u2019s wins, saying months of canvassing in Georgia paid off. LaTosha Brown, co-founder of Black Voters Matter, said Wednesday she felt both \u201cresolved\u201d and \u201chopeful.\u201d \u201cBlack folks rose to the occasion,\u201d Brown told CNN. \u201cPressure has a way that it can crush you or it can propel you. We took our trauma and our pain and we created possibilities.\u201d Black Georgia voters' high turnout helped solidify a historic win, organizers say The excitement around Warnock\u2019s and Ossoff\u2019s victories was clouded Wednesday when protesters who refuse to accept President Donald Trump\u2019s election loss stormed the Capitol where Congress was certifying President-elect Joe Biden\u2019s win. Brown said she was \u201cangry\u201d to see the unrest. \u201cWhite folks have so much privilege and there is so much deference to White power and there is such a tolerance for racism that you see them storm what is historically the seat of power,\u201d Brown said. \u201cI\u2019ve seen them be more aggressive with peaceful (Black Lives Matter) protesters. But that is indicative of how this country continues to coddle White supremacy.\u201d Evan Wayne Malbrough, founder of the Georgia Youth Poll Worker Project, said Warnock\u2019s and Ossoff\u2019s wins showed a shift in Black progressives who organized and made sure their voices were heard at the polls. The organizing, including Malbrough\u2019s efforts to recruit young poll workers for communities in need, led to higher turnout and improved voter access, Malbrough said. \u201cIt\u2019s great to see that all the work paid off by so many people,\u201d Malbrough said. \u201cIt\u2019s great to see a win in Georgia.\u201d Warnock and Ossoff were celebrated beyond the state, with supporters from across the US recognizing what the wins meant for Black Americans and political control in Washington. Angeanette Thibodeaux, of Houston, has spent the last three months in Georgia canvassing voters. Thibodeaux, who organized with the Neighborhood Assistance Corporation of America, knocked on doors, registered voters, distributed information about early voting and offered voters rides to the polls. Thibodeaux said she was determined to help Warnock and Ossoff because of their promise to fight for Black Americans. Black people, she said, need affordable health care and jobs. Warnock will make history as Georgia's first Black senator \u201cWe are so energized and empowered just to see this historic turnout,\u201d she said. \u201cWe feel like the mission has been accomplished.\u201d Warnock and Ossoff are following in the footsteps of earlier civil rights heroes from Georgia who fought for equality. Warnock is senior pastor of Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta, where Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. once preached. Warnock often speaks out from the pulpit about racial injustice. Ossoff said he was the prot\u00e9g\u00e9 of the late Rep. John Lewis, who championed voting rights. The Rev. Al Sharpton was among the civil rights leaders who applauded Warnock and Ossoff. Sharpton, who heads the National Action Network, said in a statement that the record turnout demonstrated the \u201cstrength of our democracy and Georgians\u2019 determination to use their right to vote to determine their futures.\u201d \u201cGeorgia electing its first Black Senator-elect and first Jewish American Senator-elect in our time is a sign of a new America. We are bringing America back to where we ought to be and moving forward towards change,\u201d Sharpton said.",

            "article_content": "President-elect Joe Biden has decided to nominate Judge Merrick Garland as attorney general, people familiar with the matter tell CNN, a long-awaited decision that moved toward completion Wednesday as it became apparent that Democrats were on the brink of winning control of the Senate. The announcement of the attorney general, along with other senior leaders of the Justice Department, is expected to be made as soon as Thursday as Biden moves closer to filling the remaining seats in his Cabinet before assuming power on January 20.   Biden has selected Lisa Monaco, a former homeland security adviser in the Obama administration who has become a close aide to Biden, to be the deputy attorney general, according to a person familiar with the decision. The President-elect has selected Vanita Gupta, who served as principal deputy assistant attorney general and led the civil rights division at the Department of Justice under President Barack Obama, to be associate attorney general, and Kristen Clarke, the president and executive director of the National Lawyers\u2019 Committee for Civil Rights Under Law, to be assistant attorney general for civil rights, the person said. Garland was chosen by Biden for attorney general over former Alabama Sen. Doug Jones and former acting attorney general Sally Yates, the two other finalists for the position. While Garland has been a top contender for weeks, concerns about the vacancy his selection would create on the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia raised alarm bells among Biden and many advisers who believed Senate Republicans would block any nomination to that seat. But with Democrats poised to control the Senate after two Georgia runoff races, those concerns were allayed. \u201cJudge Garland will be viewed in a whole new light now,\u201d a top Biden ally tells CNN. Politico first reported the pick. Late last month, Biden told reporters he was not waiting until the Georgia races were finished to make his decision. But this week, that\u2019s exactly what he is doing. Advisers insist a variety of factors led to the decision of Garland, but acknowledged that the long, often-criticized deliberations of Biden actually paid off in this case. Garland, who in recent weeks has stepped away from hearing cases on the bench to prepare for the prospect of the nomination, steadily emerged as a leading contender over the last two months since Biden won the election. The revelation that there is a federal investigation into the taxes and business dealings of Hunter Biden, the President-elect\u2019s son, also contributed to those pushing Garland. Defenders of Garland argued he would be a particularly strong choice to lead the Justice Department in the post-Trump era because he is seen as above reproach of partisan politics. Some allies describe him as a \u201cBoy Scout,\u201d which is intended to suggest he would be seen as a non-political figure. In the end, a confluence of factors drove the decision, but people familiar with the matter say it\u2019s largely because of how Biden believes Garland can rise above politics in the post-Trump era. President Donald Trump\u2019s escalating post-election antics have solidified Biden\u2019s view of choosing Garland, people familiar with the matter say, as Biden believes the nation demands competence and craves unity. Obama nominated Garland to the Supreme Court after a vacancy was created by the death of Justice Antonin Scalia in 2016. But Republicans, led by Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, refused for months to hold confirmation hearings or the required vote in the chamber. When Trump took office, Garland\u2019s nomination expired and he returned to his position as chief judge of the US Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit. The court is charged with reviewing challenges to administrative agencies. He stepped down from the position as chief judge in February 2020, but still serves on the court. President Bill Clinton appointed him to the court in 1997. Prior to his appointment as a US circuit judge, Garland served as principal associate deputy attorney general. He supervised the investigation of the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing, which killed more than 160 people and injured several hundred more. Garland also led the investigations of the 1996 Olympics bombing in Atlanta, in which two people died and more than 100 others were injured. Garland led the investigation into Ted Kaczynski, also known as \u201cThe Unabomber,\u201d who is currently serving eight life sentences for murder. He killed three people and injured more than 20 others with a string of mail bombings. The judge served as an assistant US attorney for the District of Columbia from 1989 to 1992, and as deputy assistant attorney general in the criminal division of the Justice Department from 1993 to 1994. Garland\u2019s nomination will disappoint those who had pressured Biden to nominate a person of color as attorney general. Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris met last month with civil rights leaders and members of the NAACP, who have been pressuring Biden to diversify his Cabinet and create a position within the White House for a civil rights czar. The Rev. Al Sharpton said at a news conference after the meeting that Biden should choose an attorney general with a civil rights background and said his preference would be a Black nominee. Sharpton said mentioned as potential picks former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick and Tony West, the senior vice president and chief legal officer at Uber who was previously the associate attorney general of the United States under the Obama administration. Clarke said at the same news conference that whoever is selected as attorney general \u201cmust have a clear and bold record when it comes to civil rights and racial justice.\u201d Sharpton responded to the Garland pick with a skeptical statement and asked for a meeting with the nominee. \u201cI would have still preferred a Black Attorney General nominee or someone with a clear record on voting rights and police reform, particularly at this day and time,\u201d Sharpton said in a statement. \u201cI\u2019m unclear on Judge Garland\u2019s record on both and there are very few, if any, written arguments that he has as a Judge to track these positions.\u201d He added: \u201cI therefore think that he should immediately meet with the civil rights leadership that has met with President-elect Biden and Vice President-elect Harris to discuss things like enforcement of voting rights and police accountability as well as pending legislation with both.\u201d This story has been updated with additional reporting and background information about Garland.

            "article_content": "Black Georgia voters showed up in droves for the state\u2019s pair of US Senate runoffs and voting rights groups say the high turnout plus aggressive organizing efforts helped solidify a historic win. Rev. Raphael Warnock, the senior pastor of the historic Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta, was elected on Tuesday to be the first Black senator from Georgia, CNN projected early Wednesday morning. The control of the US Senate now comes down to Republican David Perdue, who is running to keep his seat against Democrat Jon Ossoff. Warnock\u2019s win is a repudiation of Republican Sen. Kelly Loeffler and her adherence to President Donald Trump, who voting rights activists say has attempted to suppress Black voters by accusing majority-Black cities such as Atlanta of fraud in the general election after he lost to Biden. Black-led voting groups spent the last six weeks knocking on millions of doors, registering voters, distributing mailers, hosting events and partnering with Atlanta hip-hop artists to expand their reach. Their efforts came as Atlanta was thrust into the national spotlight following Biden\u2019s victory that flipped Georgia blue after he won the state by more than 11,000 votes. In the days leading up to the Senate runoffs, Black women such as Stacey Abrams and LaTosha Brown once again emerged as the leading voices, appearing on social media, national television and bus tours to urge Black people to vote. Organizers say get-out-the-vote efforts increased participation from Black voters who didn\u2019t vote in November or may not have otherwise voted in a runoff. Nse Ufot, CEO of the New Georgia Project, said this momentum made it hard for Black voters to ignore their significance to the Democratic party. Black voters, she said, also recognized the high stakes: if Democrats win both seats, they take control of the US Senate. In majority-Black Georgia county, voting in Senate runoffs is more about fight to vote than right to vote \u201cThe margins are so small that every action, including your vote, matters and will make a difference,\u201d Ufot said. \u201cBlack voters got that message. Black voters recognized that we need to complete the task.\u201d Early exit polls on Tuesday revealed that 93% of Black voters supported Democratic challengers Ossoff and Warnock. Republicans Loeffler and Perdue, meanwhile, received 71% of the White vote. Many voting rights activists say Georgia\u2019s increasing diversity has created a path to victory for Democrats. The number of Black voters has grown considerably in the past two decades and represented a third of the state\u2019s electorate in 2019, according to the Pew Research Center. Yet, Brown said Trump\u2019s voter suppression are \u201cfrustrating\u201d for Black voters and many turned out because they want to protect their constitutional rights and end \u201cstructural racism.\u201d On Saturday, Trump urged Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to \u201cfind\u201d votes to overturn the election results, according to an audio recording of a phone call obtained by CNN and first reported by the Washington Post. Raffensperger maintains that the election results are accurate. And with all eyes on Georgia, Brown said she has been able to garner more support in her efforts to get Black voters to the polls. \u201cThere are resources in the state that normally aren\u2019t in the state,\u201d she said. \u201cI think now people are seeing the significance of Black voters and how we can impact this election based on how they saw we impacted the general election.\u201d Charles Bullock, a professor of political science at the University of Georgia, said in early voting, the Black vote was \u201cespecially powerful.\u201d He said Black voters have been more enthusiastic in part because campaign efforts, including in-person contacts, have increased compared to the presidential election. \u201cOne of most effective ways to get someone to vote is to have a supporter come and knock on your door and say, \u2018Please go vote,\u2019\u201d Bullock said. Bullock said Warnock had also driven Black voters to the polls because his win is historic. Warnock, a senior pastor at Ebenezer, the former church of Martin Luther King Jr.,  has used the pulpit to preach against police brutality and racism in the past. He was also the officiant for the funerals of the late Congressman John Lewis, a civil rights hero, and Rayshard Brooks, a Black man who was killed by an Atlanta police officer last June. Martin Luther King III said there was a lot at stake for Black voters in the Senate runoffs. Last month, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell rejected a bill to increase stimulus checks to $2,000, which would have provided much-needed money for Black families who have lost jobs and been sickened by Covid-19 at higher rates than white people during the pandemic. McConnell has also refused to take up the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act \u2013 which would end certain police practices, such as the use of no-knock warrants and chokeholds \u2013 and the John Lewis Voting Rights Advancement Act that looks to stop the racial discrimination of voters. King III said if Warnock and Ossoff won, Democrats could pass these three bills that would benefit Black Americans. King credited grassroots organizing for engaging Black voters in the Georgia saying \u201cyou meet people where they are.\u201d The strategies used to turn Georgia blue should be replicated in other reliably red states throughout the Deep South, he said. \u201c2020, it showed that if you are diligent and determined that there can be a victory,\u201d King said. \u201cThat mobilized and created enthusiasm (with Black voters) all across the community.\u201d The hip-hop community also played a role in getting Black voters to the polls. Atlanta-based rapper Jeezy, one of several hip-hop artists who turned their focus to boost turnout, said the Senate runoff is the first time in years that Black voices have a chance to really count. How Atlanta rappers helped flip the White House \u201cWe have to understand what our value is. For the longest time my culture (felt) like we\u2019ve been alienated from politics and now we have a say,\u201d Jeezy said. \u201cAt this point we\u2019re all into politics because it\u2019s our world. If we don\u2019t say anything or do anything, we get pushed to the wayside.\u201d In November, Abrams joined him and rapper Gucci Mane on Verzuz music battle watched by at least 1.8 million people to encourage viewers to vote in the Georgia runoff elections. Jeezy wrote an op-ed about the election for Rolling Stone, performed in a drive-in concert to encourage voters on Sunday and set up an AR experienced at some polling locations for Election Day. The Georgia US Senate races attracted enormous attention due to the stakes for the first years of the Biden administration and the state\u2019s shift from red to purple. Bullock, the University of Georgia political science professor, told CNN that the Senate elections could be the first in which urban Georgia casts more votes than rural Georgia. \u201cWe\u2019ve seen tremendous enthusiasm in the early voting numbers, both in person and by mail, and we know that while Democrats will have a lead when polls open \u2026 Republicans are expected to have a strong Election Day,\u201d said Seth Bringman, a spokesman for Fair Fight Action, a voting rights organization founded by Abrams.

            "article_content": "CNN Films\u2019 \u201cJimmy Carter: Rock & Roll President,\u201d airs Sunday at 9 p.m. ET. Georgia may feel teleported to the center of the US political universe, but its emergence as a swing state has been a long time coming. That doesn\u2019t make its political evolution any less remarkable. One of the five Southern states that voted for the segregationist George Wallace in 1968, it joins Virginia as one of two Southern states to oppose Donald Trump in the 2020 presidential election. It\u2019s not the folksy rhetoric of a White man pushing a connection to rural America \u2013 Jimmy Carter, from Plains, Georgia, or Bill Clinton, from Hope, Arkansas, that won Georgia for President-elect Joe Biden. It was a sophisticated turnout operation that awoke more than 150,000 more votes in the urban Atlanta region in 2020 compared to 2016 and, separately, rapidly growing suburbs fed up with Trump\u2019s brand of conservatism. It\u2019s a quickly growing population, and a diversifying one, that responded to those efforts. Atlanta is a capitol of Black American culture and the state has seen a massive influx of Latinos. Related: How Atlanta rappers helped flip the White House (and they\u2019re hustling to flip the US Senate) This year, no other US state has felt more important: After nearly three decades supporting Republican presidential candidates \u2013 the last Democrat Georgia supported was Bill Clinton in 1992 \u2013 its vote for Biden seemed like a surprise, but it came after a remarkable grassroots campaign to get new voters to the polls and years of demographic shifts that have created a more diverse population. The question for Georgia is whether Democratic gains signal a real shift or a mirage. After all, among swing states, there are those permanently in the category, like Florida and Ohio, there are those transitioning from reliably supporting one party to the other, like Virginia, and there are fluke states. Barack Obama turned two previously red southern states blue in 2008. But while Virginia has stayed in the Democratic column in each successive presidential election and now seems as reliably blue as any other US state, North Carolina veered back to Republicans, although it has remained at the top of Democrats\u2019 target list. The outcome of the twin Senate runoffs in Georgia on January 5 will hold some indication and test the turnout operation Stacey Abrams undertook with her organization The New Georgia Project after she narrowly lost the 2018 governor\u2019s race there. Related: For Stacey Abrams, Revenge is a dish best served blue Getting people who haven\u2019t been voting and engaging younger voters have long been the aim of Democrats who want to appeal to the wide range of minority voters. Actually making it happen is what helped them win in Georgia. \u201cWe have seen dramatic turnout among communities that typically are not at the top of mind for candidates. We have seen them be engaged, be encouraged and we have seen them turn out,\u201d Abrams told CNN on Election Day in November. Part of it might also come down to paying attention. Democrats focused national efforts on Georgia and won. They frustrated Texas Democrats when they didn\u2019t pay as much attention there with visits by national candidates, and lost. I talked to Andra Gillespie, a professor at Emory University and director of the James Weldon Johnson Institute for the Study of Race and Difference, to better understand the trends specifically in Georgia. When I spoke to her in June, by the way, it still seemed like a reach for Biden to win Georgia, even if the state was clearly in play, and probably will be for years to come. But the most important thing I took from our conversation last week is that parties are constantly realigning. And today\u2019s Democrats and Republicans could be unrecognizable in the future. Our phone conversation, lightly edited for length and flow, is below: WHAT MATTERS: What\u2019s going on in Georgia, broadly speaking, with a shift toward Democrats right now? GILLESPIE: What we have seen in the last decade is that in statewide elections in Georgia is that Democrats have been increasing their margins. They\u2019ve been garnering more votes. They\u2019ve been narrowing the gap between them and the Republican Party. So if they were going to continue on that trajectory, it was only a matter of time before Democrats were going to pass Republicans in terms of the vote. Winning the presidential election is only one data point, so I can\u2019t, I can\u2019t create a trend just yet with respect to that. What I suspect we\u2019re entering into is an era of increased competition where I\u2019m expecting that we\u2019re going to continue to see very narrow margins between Democratic and Republican candidates in statewide elections, where Democrats win some elections and Republicans some elections. I don\u2019t think Georgia is blue by any stretch of the imagination, but it is moving towards some form of purple and I wouldn\u2019t be surprised if we stay there for, you know, the next decade or so. WHAT MATTERS: How is the Georgia that Biden won different than the Georgia that Carter won, or before that, Wallace? GILLESPIE: What we saw in the \u201980s and \u201890s, in any race that didn\u2019t involve Sam Nunn, was a shift of White voters away from the Democratic Party and toward the Republican Party. Southern whites were a firm part of the New Deal coalition and that starts to change after the Civil Rights Movement. It didn\u2019t happen overnight. It took a long period of time. It culminated in the 2000s, at the beginning of the decade, with Sonny Perdue\u2019s gubernatorial victory and a change in party of the control in the state House of Representatives. And then it culminated by the 2010s at the end of the decade, when all of the statewide offices were won by Republican candidates. Gallery: Jimmy Carter: the making of a Rock & Roll President That\u2019s a very different shift than what\u2019s happening now. We\u2019re not seeing a big shift in terms of White voters in the state of Georgia, even though Georgia has a nontrivial number of White Democratic voters. What we\u2019re seeing is a growth in the nonwhite population and in the nonwhite electorate that tends to lean Democratic in its voting behavior. That, coupled with a nontrivial number of White Democratic voters, is making the state more competitive. We also have to credit the effort of both the Democratic Party and outside groups in reaching out to likely Democratic voters, getting them registered to vote and then getting them educated and mobilized so that they actually turn out to vote. GILLESPIE: What we\u2019ve seen happen in the last 20 years in the state is, one: the size of the African American vote makes up 30% of registered voters in the state. Given the fact that they are 90% Democratic in their voting behaviors, that means they make up the majority of Democratic voters in the state. But you can\u2019t win with 90% of 30% of the population, so you need a nontrivial number of White voters. And unlike neighboring states, Georgia is in a position where Democrats can get 30% of White voters. Georgia, unlike South Carolina or Alabama or Mississippi, has a very fast-growing Asian American and Hispanic population. While the Black electorate grew in the 2000s, the growth has been the most Asian American and Hispanic voters in the 2010s. They were 3% of all of registered voters in 2012, they were 6% of registered voters in this election cycle, and they also break Democratic. And if you get everybody to turn out to vote, you can put a winning electoral coalition together of African American, Asian American, Hispanic and liberal White voters. WHAT MATTERS: Why are the White voters in Georgia potentially more liberal than they are in neighboring southern states? GILLESPIE: In part because of Atlanta being a financial hub, a tech hub, a hub for the arts. Atlanta is attracting well educated professional types of voters who are more Democratic in their orientation. Whether you\u2019re coming to work for the major universities, whether you\u2019re coming to work in tech or one of the Fortune 500 companies, whether you have come to Georgia to work in the arts and entertainment industry here, in Atlanta. These are voters who are perceived as being more Democratic in their orientation. They also may not be from the region. And they bring different values with them into the state. WHAT MATTERS: This is a state that voted for George Wallace 52 years ago. What\u2019s it going to look like in 50 years? GILLESPIE: I have no idea what it is going to look like politically in 50 years. That\u2019s a lot of time. And with one breakthrough election, I can\u2019t extrapolate very far into the future. So I want to hesitate in over reading the data that I have right now. Suffice to say that when my colleagues and I talk about changing demographics in the state, I want to be very clear that we\u2019re not making a \u2018demographics are destiny\u2019 type of argument. In particular, Georgia is more Democratic now because it\u2019s got growing populations of color who are predisposed to be Democratic in orientation. This is not to say that 20 or 40 or 50 years from now that these populations are still going to be Democratic in orientation. A lot can change. Let\u2019s say America can get a handle on its racism problem. You\u2019ll probably see people making fewer political decisions based on the racial identity. The parties can also change their attitudes. We\u2019ve seen that happen. A hundred years ago, who would have thought that the Democratic Party, the party of segregation, that would be the party of Civil Rights today? But that happened because the party changed its policies on these issues. Or who would have thought that the party of Lincoln would be the party of Donald Trump? The parties as we know them today could be different. They may not exist anymore, so I can\u2019t speculate that far into the future. And I think it\u2019s also important to understand that voting behavior and party identification are dynamic and that they are subject to change, depending on what political changes happen, what decisions our society makes in terms of what issues they want to advocate for.",

The vote is the most powerful nonviolent change agent you have in a democratic society. You must use it because it is not guaranteed. You can lose it,\u201d the civil rights icon wrote in an piece for The New York Times, published posthumously last week. His words, published just a week before the 55th anniversary of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, ring true for a country that still faces gaps in voter registration for voters of color \u2014 an issue that has been further exacerbated by the coronavirus pandemic. The 14th and 15th Amendments established voting rights after the Civil War, but a series of laws put in place afterward, from literacy tests and poll taxes, suppressed the vote. The Voting Rights Act, enforcing the 14th and 15th Amendments and combating voter suppression tactics, was signed into law on August 6, 1965. Since then, registration for Black voters has increased over the decades, hitting a record-high of 73% in the 2012 presidential election, according to Census data \u2014 the same year that Barack Obama, the nation\u2019s first Black president, was running for reelection. In 2012, for the first time, the gap between registered Black and White voters nearly closed entirely \u2014 briefly fulfilling one of the primary goals of the Voting Rights Act. But since 2012, the gap has widened again across all demographic groups, but especially for Black voters. In the 2018 midterm elections, 71% of white Americans were registered to vote, while Black registration dropped to 64%, according to Census data. Less than 55% of Hispanic and Asian Americans were registered to vote in 2018. \u201cThe stakes are quite high,\u201d Jalila Jefferson-Bullock, a former Louisiana state lawmaker and associate professor at Duquesne University School of Law in Pittsburgh told CNN. \u201cVoting equals power. And once you are able to elect the candidates of your choice, that means you have to be given a seat at the political table.\u201d The registration gap has also become increasingly notable in a handful of battleground states that will be crucial to the outcome of this year\u2019s election. Swing states like Arizona, Florida, Michigan and Pennsylvania have experienced some of the largest decreases in voter registration among Black and Hispanic voters between the 2014 and 2018 midterms. Census data shows that voter registration has increased for white voters in each of those six battlegrounds over the same period, however. The registration declines since 2012 are particularly concerning for voting advocates because new voter registrations in 2020 and typical outreach ahead of a presidential election have been almost entirely disrupted by the pandemic. A June report from the nonpartisan Center for Election Innovation and Research has shown sharp declines in new voter registrations compared to 2016, a sign that the pandemic is affecting another cornerstone of American life. The typical ways that voters have registered in the past have become nearly non-existent amid the pandemic. Ahead of the 2016 election, Census data shows that a majority of voters registered in person through a government office, such as their local Department of Motor Vehicles, or through another community venue, such as a school or hospital. The continuing spread of Covid-19 has limited access to those government and public offices, some of which have closed altogether. Voter drives, door-knocking and other methods of in-person registration are also much more difficult, if not impossible, this election cycle. In 2016, Black voters were more likely to register in person and were among the least likely to register online or by mail \u2014 two of the safest options to register this year amid the coronavirus pandemic. Hispanic and Asian voters, however, registered online or by mail at higher rates than all other voters in 2016. The decline in registration this year has led many celebrities and voting rights groups to push in the last 100 days before November, most notably former first lady Michelle Obama. When We All Vote, a nonpartisan organization committed to voter registration that Obama co-chairs, implemented digital voter registration techniques in the spring to use ahead of November. On Thursday, the group launched its voter resources hub, which includes tools such as registering to vote, checking one\u2019s voter registration status and pledging to vote. In the coming weeks, the group also plans to include ways to request a mail-in ballot, research candidates on a voter\u2019s ballot and locate polling places. \u201cThe anniversary of the Voting Rights Act reminds us that even though we are grappling with the coronavirus pandemic, police brutality, and racial injustice, we are reminded of the sacrifices of people like John Lewis and his peers, and encouraged to stay in the fight to help every eligible voter get registered and ready to vote,\u201d said Stephanie Young, the group\u2019s chief officer of culture, communications and media partnerships. Lebron James, alongside other Black athletes and entertainers, launched a similar organization in June called \u201cMore Than A Vote.\u201d \u201cWe were on track to hit our goal of 51,000 (in Florida) before the election but unfortunately the pandemic changed our plans,\u201d Esteban Garces, co-executive director of Poder Latinx, told CNN. \u201cSince then we have completely pivoted to a voter engagement program by way of phones \u2026 we know that folks are less inclined to open the door and have a conversation.\u201d Garces said that registering is not only about engaging the voters but capitalizing on political power for historically marginalized voting blocs. \u201c(W)e hope that we are building political capital while we are also doing this work so that on the day after the election, we\u2019ve engaged the community, we\u2019ve informed the community and they want to see these changes happen,\u201d Garces said. Every state but North Dakota requires that an eligible citizen be registered in order to vote, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. As of June 2019, 21 states plus the District of Columbia have enacted same-day voter registration, while 27 require voters to register by a given deadline prior to Election Day, according to NCSL. New Mexico has passed legislation for same-day registration but will implement it over the course of a couple of years. North Carolina will have same-day registration for a portion of the early voting period, but not on Election Day, according to NCSL. In the 2016 presidential election, 4% of all registered voters who didn\u2019t vote said that an issue with their registration prevented them from casting their ballots, according to Census data. Eligible Hispanic voters reported the highest rate of voter registration issues. More than 5% of registered Hispanic citizens who didn\u2019t vote said the primary barrier was a problem with their registration. Voter registration is the starting point for many voters to weigh in on policies that affect their local communities. LaTosha Brown, a co-founder of Black Voters Matter, said that while registration is the first step, ultimately it is about empowering voters to feel they have a voice in the democratic process. \u201cVoter registration opens up a pathway for us to demonstrate our agency and also for us to influence and leverage our power. To shift the process so that we are reducing harm that is happening in our community, that we are shaping public policy that impacts our community and that we are putting people in office so we can have a more reflective democracy,\u201d Brown said. Black Voters Matter has voter registration statewide operations in states like Alabama, Georgia, North Carolina, Pennsylvania and Florida as well as targeted operations in places like Houston and Hudson, New York. \u201cIt can\u2019t just be the act of registering, it has to be a part of the pathway of people feeling a sense of their own power,\u201d Brown said.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: David Axelrod, a senior CNN political commentator and host of \u201cThe Axe Files,\u201d was a senior adviser to President Barack Obama and chief strategist for the 2008 and 2012 Obama presidential campaigns. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his. View more opinion on CNN. In the spring of 2006, I received an unexpected call from my friend and client, Barack Obama, who was then a little more than a year into his career in the US Senate. \u201cI just had the strangest conversation with Harry Reid and Chuck Schumer,\u201d he told me, fresh from a meeting with the US Senate Democratic leaders. \u201cI didn\u2019t know why they were calling me over there. Turns out they wanted to tell me I should run for president.\u201d Harry Reid, a longtime US senator from Nevada and former Democratic leader, dies at 82 Reid, then Senate minority leader, argued that, unlike the presumptive frontrunner \u2013 Hillary Clinton \u2013 Obama was untainted by a vote for the unpopular war in Iraq, an albatross the leader feared would sink her and take some of his party\u2019s Senate candidates down in the undertow. Far from viewing Obama\u2019s newness to Washington, DC, as an impediment, Reid, who had served there for over 20 years, argued that the young senator\u2019s freshness would be an asset to a country hungry for change. \u201cThey pushed me pretty hard to think about it,\u201d Obama told me, still absorbing the full meaning of what had just transpired. \u201cI still think it\u2019s pretty far-fetched, but it\u2019s interesting that they felt as strongly as they do.\u201d I can\u2019t say that Obama would never have come around to the idea of running for president without the quiet encouragement of Reid that spring. But I can say for sure that their conversation made a deep impression on the young senator, who knew that Reid hadn\u2019t fought his way up through the rough-and-tumble of Nevada politics and the ranks of the US Senate by making careless bets. The fact that the leader would buck the party establishment, of which he was part, by planting the seeds of an insurgency was an unexpected turn that begged serious consideration. As different as they seemed, a tremendous bond grew between the understated Reid \u2013 who died Tuesday at 82 after a long battle with pancreatic cancer \u2013 and the charismatic young president he helped propel forward. Reid\u2019s improbable rise from hardscrabble beginnings in the tiny brothel town of Searchlight, Nevada, was the stuff of legends, and he saw in Obama someone who had overcome his own hardships \u2013 along with withering racial barriers \u2013 to achieve unimaginable heights. Gergen looks back on Harry Reid's career in the Senate After the election of 2008, Reid, by then Senate majority leader, sat down with President-elect Obama. A prizefighter in his youth, Reid made a point by recalling his days in the ring. \u201cI wasn\u2019t the fastest guy. I wasn\u2019t the strongest. But I sure could take a punch!\u201d And he would take, and throw, many punches for Obama\u2019s agenda. Along with House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, Reid\u2019s persistence helped deliver the Affordable Care Act after an epic battle, an achievement which he said had particular meaning to him because of the privations he had seen uninsured family members and neighbors suffer in his life. \u201cI felt a tremendous pressure to get it done. And having been raised the way that I was with no health care, my mother had no teeth, we didn\u2019t go to doctors\u2026 it was one of the landmark pieces of legislation in the history of this country,\u201d he told me in 2019. But if Reid, who served as the Democratic leader for 12 years, was a point man for his president, he also was a hard-nosed realist when it came to protecting the members of his caucus from unnecessarily risky votes. He called me in the early summer of 2009 and wanted to talk about a cap-and-trade bill we had passed through the US House of Representatives to reduce the carbon emissions that were accelerating climate change. The bill was controversial in energy-producing states, and the House vote had been a heavy lift. Now we were hoping for a vote in the Senate, which we knew would be even more challenging. \u201cYou know we have a lot going on up here this summer, what with the health care bill and a lot of other things we absolutely have to get done,\u201d Reid said. \u201cSo we\u2019re not going to get to the climate bill.\u201d He paused. \u201cWould you tell the President?\u201d At that moment, the line went dead, which is how every telephone conversation with the leader ended. Harry Reid: I do not regret changing the Senate rules \u201cI\u2019m not much for small talk. The conversation was over; we\u2019d done our business. There\u2019s no need to talk anymore,\u201d he explained to me in 2019 when I asked him about this and his legendary habit of ending calls without saying goodbye. Throughout those years, Reid tangled regularly with Mitch McConnell, who as the Senate Republican leader, led an implacable opposition to Obama, including the brazen decision to block the Senate for the better part of the President\u2019s final year from taking up the nomination of Merrick Garland to the US Supreme Court. When I last sat down with Reid for \u201cThe Axe Files,\u201d Reid had plenty to say about that blockade, yet he refrained from making it personal. A proud and pugnacious partisan, he also was a man of the institution. At the end of his life, he was not going to impugn his longtime adversary. \u201cI know Mitch McConnell very well, and I\u2019m not going to disparage him here today,\u201d he said. \u201cBut I have been somewhat disappointed. I think what he did with the Supreme Court is something that will go down in history as a very dark time in the history of this country.\u201d Reid was a rare person in today\u2019s politics. A plainspoken man, allergic to flowery rhetoric and performative politics; relentless \u2013 even ruthless \u2013 in pursuit of legislative and electoral victories but animated by time-honored verities and ideals to which he held fast until the end. And he was palpably proud of his partnership with the 44th president.  On the last lap of Obama\u2019s final campaign in 2012, we made a stop for a rally in Las Vegas.  Reid had requested a minute with Obama to ask him to cut an ad for Mazie Hirono, the Democratic Senate candidate in Hawaii. But after he made the ask, the leader suddenly reached out and hugged the President, a physical display of fellowship and affection that surprised us. Then he turned abruptly and, like a Reid phone call, he was gone without another word. In 2019, I asked him about that moment and his relationship with the President for whom he had made such a difference. \u201cWell, I don\u2019t hesitate to say on this show, I don\u2019t care who\u2019s listening and this is something I don\u2019t throw around very often, but I love Barack Obama, I really do,\u201d he told me. \u201cNo one else could do what he did.\u201d Right back at you, Sen. Reid. May you rest in peace. And may your remarkable memory always be a blessing.",

She is a frequent opinion contributor to CNN, a contributing columnist to The Washington Post and a columnist for World Politics Review. The views expressed in this commentary are her own. View more opinion on CNN. One of the lessons of the past two years \u2013 and one that will come in handy in 2022 \u2013 is that when problems are real, playing political games and twisting the truth does not help to solve them. That seemingly self-evident bit of wisdom, ignored with deadly results by the previous administration, should stand as the centerpiece in another major challenge \u2013 the battle against the rise in violent crime across in the United States. Whether you prefer Democrats or Republicans, the key here is solving the problem: stemming the rise in violence that is leaving thousands of Americans dead and millions more feeling vulnerable and unsafe. First, the facts. The murder rate in the US exploded in 2020, up 30% from 2019, according to provisional numbers from the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. That was the largest single-year increase in 100 years (although it\u2019s well below the homicide rates of the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s). The numbers have continued to rise in 2021, although at a slower rate. Other types of crime also increased but not as much as murder. To hear the GOP tell it, this is all the product of Democratic policies, affecting cities and states led by Democratic leaders and majorities. In reality, the facts tell a different story. Crime increased last year in most states in the US. The largest increases came in Montana (84% increase), South Dakota (81%), Delaware (62%) and Kentucky (61%.) That\u2019s hardly a geographic atlas of progressive politics. To be sure, crime rates are higher in urban areas, where there\u2019s higher density, and cities tend to be more Democratic than Republican. But the dominant factors are more likely related to realities of urban life \u2013 not party affiliation. So, why has the level of violence soared in the country? There\u2019s no simple answer. The pandemic has something to do with it. People are frustrated, anxious and stressed. But the pandemic has hit the entire planet, and the crime rate has not soared across the world. The exploding murder rate is an American phenomenon. Rising crime puts Democrats on edge No developed country has more guns than the US, and guns are being used in an even larger number of murders. When guns are brandished in a fight or in a robbery, the chance that someone dies is much greater. Crime rates have also likely increased because of friction between the police and the community. Racial tensions and animosity have led to many police officers leaving their jobs, have made others reluctant to intervene in conflicts and have caused the public to hesitate calling police they don\u2019t trust. In my view, another factor is the political climate. With so many Republicans arguing the system is unfair and falsely claiming elections are illegitimate and with many Democrats claiming the system is rigged to favor the rich and powerful, there is a growing sense of anger and mistrust among segments of the public. As the 2022 political campaigns gain traction, we will hear more and more claims that murders are rising because Democrats chanted \u201cdefund the police,\u201d even though many Democrats oppose such defunding measures. Democrats, for their part, may choose to blame it all on America\u2019s wild availability of guns. For responsible political leaders, the right approach is to tackle the problem with facts, creative ideas and effective implementation. Smerconish: Police reform intersects with crime surge Sure, the mind-boggling number of weapons in the hands of civilians is a daunting problem with deadly consequences, and the failure to address it is a blemish on America\u2019s system of government. Efforts to create gun safety rules should continue, but that cannot be the only focus. The elections of late 2021 already showed that \u201cdefund the police\u201d may have been a satisfying street chant after horrifying murders perpetrated by police officers, but the public \u2013 including Democrats of all races \u2013 want policing, and many want additional officers, too. That\u2019s one reason Eric Adams, a former policeman, was elected mayor of New York City and why boosting and improving policing was a major issue in Atlanta\u2019s mayoral election. The Justice Department has just launched a massive $1.6 billion program of grants, with hundreds of communities across the country set to receive funds to reduce violent crime. The money will support projects on gangs, domestic violence and novel crime prevention ideas. But creative thinking on crime should not require reinventing the wheel. When one looks at the rest of the developed world, the failure of the United States is breathtaking. In the Netherlands, where I spend part of the year, the number of murders in 2020 dropped from already low figures. The total number of homicides for the entire country was 121, less than 7 per 1 million people. That\u2019s about one-tenth the rate in the US. The capital, Amsterdam, a city of more than 800,000, suffered just one murder a month.  Interestingly, according to the European Commission on Human Rights, police only shoot to kill when it\u2019s \u201cabsolutely necessary.\u201d And when they shoot, they often aim for the legs of assailant. In the US, officers are generally allowed to use deadly force when they have a \u201creasonable belief\u201d that their life is in danger. I\u2019ve watched Dutch officers interact with the public in difficult situations. They seem supernaturally focused on keeping calm and reducing tensions. The imperative of deescalation techniques is finally gaining attention in the US, where the police have seemed increasingly militarized. As you read this, you may be hearing a siren blaring in the background or have just read yet another news account of a shooting. The problem is real. Downplaying it will not do. But simply playing politics is hardly the answer. As politicians eye the 2022 elections, voters would do well to watch closely and see how they handle this challenge. Their words and their actions should tell us which among them deserve support.",

View more opinion articles on CNN. Stacey Abrams\u2019 2022 campaign for Georgia governor represents a generational opportunity for Black women in American politics. It\u2019s a potential game-changer for parts of the South that continue to rely on voter suppression to retain power. Abrams, who announced on her candidacy Wednesday on Twitter, is easily the highest-profile Black female political leader in the country who does not currently hold elected office. Abrams\u2019 brilliance as a service-oriented leader, former elected official and voting-rights advocate places her in a long unbroken line of Black women organizers and activists who have sought to reimagine American democracy. While she may not become the first Black woman governor in America, as a public figure and a candidate, Abrams represents an enduring tradition of radical democratic political activism by Black women. It\u2019s one that has the potential to break down centuries-old structures of exclusion and violence that have not only marginalized Black women and the Black community but have also stifled America\u2019s democratic progress. Since losing a closely-fought 2018 Georgia governor\u2019s race by a margin of 1.4 percentage points to Republican Brian Kemp, Abrams has emerged as America\u2019s most prodigious voting-rights organizer and high-profile activist. The wording of her announcement speaks volumes about her experience in 2018 fighting back against her opponent\u2019s efforts to keep tens of thousands of Georgians, disproportionately African American, from casting a ballot. She tweeted she is running now \u201cbecause opportunity in our state shouldn\u2019t be determined by zip code, background or access to power.\u201d In the aftermath of her 2018 defeat, Abrams organized the largest get-out-the-vote effort in the history of the Peach State, helping Democrats to reclaim the US Senate through the victories of Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff,  while also pushing President Joe Biden to an unexpected victory there. An activist radio host has put his life on the line for voting rights. Biden, it's your move Abrams\u2019 rising national star found her in contention to be Biden\u2019s vice-presidential running mate, a position that ultimately went to the more politically centrist then-US Senator Kamala Harris from California. A former Georgia State legislator with law and public policy degrees from Yale and the University of Texas\u2019 LBJ School of Public Affairs, respectively, Abrams has been an indefatigable political organizer, one with a jeweler\u2019s eye for spotting talent. Abrams\u2019 work puts her in historic community with the bold work of Black women activists, freedom fighters and elected officials who came before her. Nineteenth century Black women suffragists including Frances Ellen Watkins Harper and Mary Church Terrell battled racism, sexism and White supremacy for decades in an effort to secure citizenship and dignity for African Americans. They helped to model ways to combat intersectional oppression (by race, gender and class) and became exemplars of a powerful feminist call for expanding the nation\u2019s democratic imagination to recognize and amplify Black women\u2019s leadership. Terrell and Harper organized civil rights organizations, clubs and networks that centered Black women\u2019s political voices, strategic innovations and democratic insights as integral to achieving freedom for the Black community and the nation as a whole. Black women\u2019s advocacy for a truly inclusive democracy resonates deeply in our own time as well. 2020\u2019s racial and political reckoning heralded a long awaited national and global recognition of Black women\u2019s organizing. From the grassroots moral and political crusade ignited by Black feminist leadership behind the Black Lives Matter Movement to the electoral organizing by Abrams and the election of the first Black woman vice president. The number of Black women mayors leading major cities to reach historic high. Here is why they are winning Abrams\u2019 organizing and the votes of millions of Black women nationally helped to secure so many of the 2020 political victories for Democrats, yielding crucial dividends. Bolstered Democratic power allowed for passage of a pandemic bill that centered racial equity and the recent infrastructure package, the largest investment of its kind made in generations. The bill includes $65 billion dollars aimed toward reversing decades of racial disparities in infrastructure spending, although how to spend this money is left largely up to individual states. While these policy and legislative victories are still in progress, they would not have been possible without Black women\u2019s organizing at the grassroots, service-oriented leadership in the electoral, nonprofit, religious, business and public sector arenas, and their inspirational belief that America\u2019s best days are ahead of us if we are courageous enough to prioritize people over punishment. In Congress, the voices of progressive Black women, such as Reps. Ayanna Pressley from Massachusetts and Cori Bush of Missouri have pushed the Democratic Party to champion bold, innovative and inclusive policies on a scale that matches the enormous challenges of this current moment. This past summer, Congresswoman Bush leveraged enough pressure on House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Biden to get the president to sign a 60-day eviction moratorium, an issue that aided countless low-income communities facing housing insecurity amidst the pandemic and its various recurrences. There is so much more work that needs to be done. Whether or not she is elected in Georgia next year, Abrams is uniquely positioned to push for the progress we need. The drama in Stacey Abrams' political thriller is unfolding off the page Abrams faces stiff political headwinds, particularly thanks to GOP voter suppression efforts and, thus far, the failure of the Democratic Party to pass voting rights legislation ahead of next year\u2019s midterms. Historically, the party in power suffers significant losses in midterm elections, a byproduct of historical trends, dampened voter enthusiasm for incumbents, and renewed energy by voters supporting the party out of power. Democrats\u2019 inability to pass voting rights protections, especially for a state such as Georgia which is trending blue, makes it more difficult for Abrams to make history by becoming the first Black woman elected governor. Ever. Yet this is also a time of great promise and generational opportunities. Abrams\u2019 willingness to engage in the hard work of democracy offers an important example to future leaders, especially young Black girls and women who often witness a political arena that devalues everything but, sometimes, their votes. An Abrams victory in Georgia, the state where the reorganized Ku Klux Klan came once again to life in 1915, would reflect a startling New South, one more than a century and half in the making, delayed by racial violence and terror after the Civil War, but no longer denied. Georgia is also the birthplace of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., the celebrated civil rights leader whose vision of turning America into a \u201cBeloved Community\u201d free of racial oppression, economic injustice and violence still calls out to us today. In fact, Warnock, who became the first Black senator elected from the Peach State, presides over King\u2019s former pulpit at Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta.  Abrams\u2019 endorsement  of Warnock proved pivotal to his runoff victory over Republican Kelly Loeffler, a win whose cascading effect of enormous Black voter turnout helped to push Ossoff over the top as well.  Abrams reminds us that, in the words of prison abolitionist Mariame Kaba, \u201chope is a discipline.\u201d  It\u2019s the kind of discipline that illuminates a potential path beyond the Big Lie of the stolen 2020 presidential election, disingenuous and toxic anti-critical race theory legislation and a politics of fear aimed at furthering our divisions. Her example informs even as it inspires.

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Joshua A. Douglas is a law professor at the University of Kentucky J. David Rosenberg College of Law. He is the author of Vote for US: How to Take Back Our Elections and Change the Future of Voting. Find him at www.joshuaadouglas.com and follow him on Twitter @JoshuaADouglas. The foundations for a potential coup of the 2024 election are already being put into place. The very institutions that are supposed to protect our democracy are a big part of the problem. If Donald Trump steals the election in 2024, as he tried to do in 2020, it will likely be because he and his supporters are laying the groundwork right now. They are infecting key government institutions that can be exploited to thwart the will of the voters. The Supreme Court is the first major concern. With three Trump appointees, the Court has upheld restrictive state voting rules and deferred to state legislatures on how to run elections, failing to protect the constitutional right to vote. In several cases leading up to the November 2020 election, the Court rejected lower court rulings that would have made it easier for voters to cast their ballots during a pandemic and have those votes count. In case after case, the Court essentially ignored the plight of voters and instead upheld states\u2019 authority to run an election as they see fit. That undue deference to states did not start in 2020. In a series of cases over the past few decades, the Court has required voters to show with specificity how a voting rule would burden their constitutional rights. But it has credited a state\u2019s generalized interest in rooting out voter fraud, even if the state cannot offer much evidence voter fraud is a real problem that needs fixing. The Court also essentially gutted the Voting Rights Act of 1965, which helped to secure minority voting rights in the face of racial discrimination, both in the Shelby County, Alabama case in 2013 and in a case this past July, in which the conservative majority set out rules that make it much harder for plaintiffs to bring a successful claim that a voting law has a disproportionate effect on minority voters. States are now emboldened to pass ever more restrictive voting rules, as we have seen in places like Georgia and Texas. Those rules will operate to make it easier for incumbent legislators to stay in power. Instead of a constitutional right to vote, we have a constitutional right for states to administer their elections however they want, with little fear of judicial oversight. An activist radio host has put his life on the line for voting rights. Biden, it's your move Next, state legislatures are skewing democracy through partisan gerrymandering, as they draw district maps to ensure their side has the best chance of winning a majority of seats. Already, reports suggest Republicans have gerrymandered enough congressional maps to easily flip at least five seats and take over control of the House of Representatives in 2022. Democrats are not blameless on this front, as they have also proposed egregious gerrymanders in places like Illinois. Politicians are choosing their voters instead of the other way around. And states are freer to engage in this gamesmanship knowing the Supreme Court will not intervene, as it ruled in 2019 the federal courthouse doors are closed to claims of unlawful partisan gerrymandering. A gerrymandered legislature cannot be trusted to carry out the will of the voters, which is especially dangerous if there are disputes over Electoral College votes in 2024. Finally, Trump supporters who believe\u2014without any evidence whatsoever\u2014that Joe Biden did not legitimately win the 2020 election are running for elected positions that will allow them to control the vote casting and counting process. The attempted coup in 2020 did not work in part because Republican election officials such as Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger refused to go along. Recall that Trump had asked Raffensperger to \u201cfind\u201d 11,780 additional votes to allow him to win the state. Raffensperger recognized Trump was asking him to overturn the will of the voters. But if a Trump acolyte such as Rep. Jody Hice, who is running against Raffensperger, wins the seat, who knows if a similar request in 2024 will be rejected. Some state legislatures are also authorizing the potential takeover of local boards of election. Republicans in Wisconsin are reportedly considering a brazen move to disband the bipartisan state election commission, in an attempt to give themselves more authority over elections. Many election officials are leaving their posts in response to a constant barrage of harassment stemming from their work in 2020. Trump pulls strings behind the scenes to help loyal 2022 candidates This attack on American democracy is multifaceted and the various strands reinforce each other. It\u2019s a vicious cycle. In 2024, we can\u2019t be sure these institutions will uphold the will of the voters. What can be done? First, because the Supreme Court is unlikely to suddenly change its jurisprudence to protect the right to vote, state courts must step in to fill the void to strike down the worst partisan gerrymanders and restrictive election rules. State constitutions have language that explicitly protects the right to vote and many also say elections must be \u201cfree and equal\u201d or \u201cfree and open,\u201d so state courts should use those clauses robustly. Both the North Carolina and Pennsylvania Supreme Courts invoked state constitutional language to invalidate partisan gerrymandering in their states in the last round of redistricting; other courts should now follow their lead. In addition, we must treat the 2022 election as existential for the continued vitality of our democracy. Secretary of state races in places like Georgia and Michigan are perhaps the most important elections on the ballot, because they will determine who will run the 2024 election in those states. We must elect individuals who are committed to democracy, not just loyal to a particular candidate. We also must fill vacancies in local election offices with people dedicated to democracy.  Finally, Congress must pass meaningful voting rights reform. The 2024 election should be decided by all eligible voters, not just those who are able to jump through the various hoops states have set up. Republicans should negotiate with Democrats in Congress on best practices for election administration and independent redistricting. And if Republicans refuse to even come to the negotiating table, then Democrats will have the moral standing to go it alone and scuttle the filibuster to enact democracy reform. American democracy barely survived 2020. The attacks on 2024 are already underway. Whether they succeed will depend on what we do right now.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Issac Bailey is a longtime journalist based in South Carolina and the Batten Professor of Public Policy at Davidson College. He\u2019s the author of \u201cMy Brother Moochie: Regaining Dignity in the Face of Crime, Poverty and Racism in the American South.\u201d His latest book is \u201cWhy Didn\u2019t We Riot? A Black Man in Trumpland.\u201d The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion on CNN. Watching Judge Timothy Walmsley on Wednesday read the verdicts declaring Gregory McMichael, Travis McMichael and William \u201cRoddie\u201d Bryan Jr. guilty of murdering Ahmaud Arbery in February 2020 reminded me of how I felt the day openly bigoted Donald Trump was finally declared the loser of the 2020 presidential election. I exhaled while wondering how in the world we were still having to deal with such things in 21st century America and scared as hell that months or years from now I\u2019d look back to what is good news today only to discover it was just a temporary reprieve from an ongoing backlash to racial progress. These verdicts represent a real strike against systemic racism in our criminal legal system. The judge allowed the defense to stack the jury with 11 White people and only one Black member knowing precisely why the defense was doing so. The defense pulled out every nasty, disgusting racial trope to turn 25-year-old Arbery into a villain, even acting as though Black pastors sitting silently in the courtroom represented a kind of lynch mob. The defendants did what so many like them had previously done: proclaim they pursued and one of them shot an unarmed Black man only because they were afraid for their lives, only because they were forced to do it while trying to protect their community from potential harm. That Black man was an alleged criminal, they declared. That Black man was definitely no angel, one of their attorneys made clear. He had long dirty toenails, she said with no shame. No question he wasn\u2019t the real victim, they wanted us all to know. The defense did all of that in the heart of the Deep South before a nearly all-White jury. On Wednesday, that nearly-all White jury in a case presided over by a White judge found three White men guilty as the murderers we all knew they were long before the gavel was first pounded. That nearly all-White jury shamed the defense for believing anti-Black racism would help secure an acquittal. It\u2019s the kind of decision we should want replicated throughout our system, the kind we should want proclaimed and celebrated, the kind we must hope becomes precedent. If it does, Black jurors would not be continuously discriminated against during jury selection. If it does, racist White men would think twice before arming themselves to take matters into their own hands the way so many White racist mobs did during the height of the lynching era. If it does, I\u2019ll feel less of a need to arm myself to go jogging alone, even in nearly-all-White neighborhoods. There is no conceivable justification for defense's treatment of Ahmaud Arbery We won\u2019t be able to convince every racist man he doesn\u2019t have the right to act on the racism flowing through his veins. But we can make more of them think twice before picking up a weapon to do so, at least in the most obviously-egregious cases such as this one. That\u2019s the world we should want to create, one we should hope that nearly all-White jury in Georgia has helped make more of a reality. There should have never been a time in this country in which that wasn\u2019t true. I want to celebrate what feels like a step forward, if only a small one. But I\u2019m too afraid it\u2019s a one-off in the way Derek Chauvin being declared guilty in the murder of George Floyd feels like a one-off all these months later. That verdict didn\u2019t take us closer to real policing reform as so many of us hoped it would. It was the high-water mark of a year of protests that has since fizzled only to be replaced by a hyper focus on trying to ensure that little White kids are never discomforted in classrooms when this country\u2019s racist history is. That momentum has been replaced by Republican politicians weaponizing White fear to gin up votes and supposed centrists and moderates helping them \u2013 even as it becomes clearer by the day that White fear is being used to push for anti-democratic measures that threaten to undo a half century of racial and democratic progress. It has been replaced by one of our political parties excusing the violent attack to the US Capitol building on January 6 and what that fateful day in American history means for our future.  And make no mistake, in our system you are still much more likely to be declared not guilty in self-defense cases if you are White and your victim is Black than the reverse, according to FBI data analyzed by the Marshall Project. One good verdict can\u2019t undo systemic decades-deep problems. It would take thousands, maybe tens of thousands, of cases like the one that just concluded in Georgia to represent real change. But how likely is it? The verdict in this case only became possible after a prosecutor friendly with the McMichaels was exposed and because Bryan inexplicably recorded part of the incident and hoped it would bring \u201cjustice to the family and peace to the family.\u201d It shouldn\u2019t take all of that to get a conviction for such an obviously brazen murder. Despite that, I\u2019m happy to exhale along with Arbery\u2019s family and other loved ones today, as should everyone. It\u2019s been a tough few months. As a country, we needed this reprieve. But if we pretend all is now well, there\u2019s little doubt we\u2019ll be back here again.",

We\u2019re looking back at the strongest, smartest opinion takes of the week from CNN and other outlets. \u201cIt is difficult to make predictions, especially about the future.\u201d Different versions of that saying have been attributed to physicist Niels Bohr, movie producer Samuel Goldwyn and baseball great Yogi Berra, among others. Whoever first said it captured the plight we currently face. As Covid-19 has rampaged around the world for the past two years, the disease has defied simple forecasting. The latest mysteries: Why is it surging in highly vaccinated nations like Germany? Is the US in for another, and perhaps final, \u201cwinter wave\u201d \u2013 or will vaccinations and immunity from past infections limit a significant rise in cases? \u201cIt\u2019s not clear what proportion of the population must be inoculated to attain community immunity,\u201d wrote Dr. Jonathan Reiner, \u201cbut Belgium currently has one of the world\u2019s highest Covid-19 case rates despite having completely vaccinated 74% of its population.\u201d Germany, which \u201chas vaccinated 10% more of its population than the United States,\u201d is seeing its disease rate hit record levels. But the vaccines are working. \u201cTo prevent a large winter Covid-19 spike, we must first and foremost vaccinate millions of people and do so quickly,\u201d Reiner observed. \u201cThe latest Kaiser Family Foundation poll shows that 20% of American adults say they will definitely not get the vaccine or will do so only if required. For many in this hard-core resistant minority, only a mandate linked to their job is likely to sway their decision.\u201d The US Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit temporarily blocked President Joe Biden\u2019s vaccine mandate, which was set to fully take effect in January. Vaccines are widely available in the US, with children ages 5 to 11 now eligible and with boosters on offer for adults. \u201cWhen you become a parent,\u201d wrote first lady Jill Biden, \u201cyou look at your baby and feel a mix of overwhelming love deep in your bones, and absolute terror, knowing that this fragile life is depending on you. From that moment on, you see the world differently. Every step, every street corner, every bite of food is a danger that you never even noticed before. So, we buy baby gates and cover our electrical outlets.\u201d To fend off the danger of Covid-19, \u201cwe can help take care of at least one of those worries\u201d by vaccinating young children. It\u2019s \u201cnot just another way to protect your kids against Covid-19, but the best way. It\u2019s been thoroughly reviewed and rigorously tested. It\u2019s safe. It\u2019s free and it\u2019s available for every eligible child in the country.\u201d In the Atlantic, Sarah Zhang summed up the mystery: \u201cThe U.S. has fully vaccinated 59% of the country and recorded enough cases to account for 14% of the population. (Though, given limited testing, those case numbers almost certainly underestimate true infections.) What we don\u2019t know is how to put these two numbers together, says Elizabeth Halloran, an epidemiologist at the Fred Hutchinson Cancer Research Center. What percentage of Americans have immunity against the coronavirus\u2014from vaccines or infection or both?\u201d For more on health: Kirsi Goldynia interviews Leana Wen: 100,000 Americans died in one year from a disease we can treat Miriam Bukhsh and Emmeline Ha: It\u2019s still too early to ease mask mandates in schools Nadine Burke Harris: Vaccines are necessary, but there\u2019s more we must do to truly heal With only two votes from Republicans, the Democratic-controlled House censured Rep. Paul Gosar for sharing an anime video altered to depict him killing Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and attacking Joe Biden. \u201cIt signaled that violence and misogyny have no place in our politics \u2013 and neither do politicians like Gosar who promote them,\u201d wrote Kara Alaimo. \u201cGosar\u2019s video was straight out of former President Donald Trump\u2019s playbook, which we\u2019ve learned had a toxic effect. In his book \u2018Words on Fire: The Power of Incendiary Language and How to Confront It,\u2019 Helio Fred Garcia found that after Trump verbally attacked groups \u2013 including Hispanics and Muslims \u2013 hate crimes against them increased.\u201d The day after the House censure, Trump endorsed Gosar, calling him \u201ca loyal supporter of our America First agenda.\u201d Meanwhile, the Wyoming Republican party voted last weekend to no longer recognize Rep. Liz Cheney, who has denounced Trump for setting the stage for the January 6 Capitol riot. As Frida Ghitis wrote, \u201cThere\u2019s plenty of evidence that those who stand up against the vindictive Trump will end up crushed by either his bullying ways or by his loyal followers, with little support from the rest of the GOP. And yet, it is noteworthy that in the past few days we have heard from two major figures in the conservative camp telling Trump that he should stop whining about the election he lost and let the Republican Party focus on real issues, instead of his self-serving fantasies.\u201d Rupert Murdoch, whose media empire includes hosts who have promoted the false narrative about the 2020 election, and Chris Christie, a former Trump ally, urged the party to move on and focus on the future. \u201cThey both helped Trump throughout his presidency, and it\u2019s significant that they are the ones now speaking out against him. Their plea that he stop complaining about the last election, however, will only fall on deaf ears, since Trump is simply incapable of admitting he lost. But Murdoch and Christie are sending an important message to other members of the party \u2013 and the rest of the country \u2013 that to continue supporting Trump is a dangerous folly.\u201d The Justice Department charged former Trump strategist Steve Bannon with criminal contempt of Congress for refusing to cooperate with the committee investigating the events of January 6. Bannon\u2019s lawyer said he told his client not to cooperate because Trump was claiming executive privilege as a shield against the committee\u2019s inquiries. \u201cTrump\u2019s attempt at invoking the privilege is especially weak here because he wasn\u2019t acting as chief executive when he planned and implemented his effort to overturn the election,\u201d wrote Norman Eisen, Joanna Lydgate and Joshua Perry. \u201cHe was acting as a defeated candidate, and there is no candidate privilege. Second, there\u2019s no such thing as podcaster privilege. Even if Trump could invoke the privilege, it wouldn\u2019t protect Bannon \u2013 he was a podcast host, not a White House advisor, on January 6. Bannon\u2019s whisperings with other conspirators also aren\u2019t Oval Office advice to the president.\u201d For more: Alexander Vindman and Andrei Sannikov: One of us was tortured for fighting a dictator. The other was fired for blowing the whistle on Donald Trump SE Cupp: Cheney fights insurrection while Cruz fights Big Bird Kyle Rittenhouse was acquitted Friday of all charges in the shooting of three men in Kenosha, Wisconsin. \u201cThe trial came down to two dueling narratives,\u201d wrote legal analyst Jennifer Rodgers. \u201cTo the prosecutors, Rittenhouse was a vigilante with an AR-15-style weapon who went looking for trouble. To the defense, Rittenhouse was the sobbing teenager who testified that he found himself under attack and in those lightning-fast moments made a reasonable decision to protect himself.\u201d The jury\u2019s verdict, \u201cgiven the facts, the law and other circumstances of the trial, is no surprise.\u201d Rodgers concluded, \u201cIf public concern about Rittenhouse\u2019s conduct and its results leads to a re-examination of Wisconsin\u2019s gun laws, that will be one positive thing to come out of this tragic episode.\u201d Van Jones observed that people can differ over whether Rittenhouse acted in self-defense but worried that the verdict \u201csends the signal to others that they are free to launch armed attacks to impose their version of the law \u2013 and then claim self-defense. The likely impact of this verdict will be to turn the American political landscape into even more of a \u2018wild, wild west\u2019 scenario\u2026\u201d \u201cNo Black person could show up anywhere in the United States armed with an AR-15 and shoot down three people \u2013 and then get acquitted and hailed as a national hero. So the jury\u2019s decision to free this young man is an especially bitter pill to swallow.\u201d Before the jury rendered its verdict, legal analyst Paul Callan warned that its meaning would be limited. \u201cIntense media coverage pushes a public already sharply divided by political differences to expect a social and political message from the jury\u2019s verdict,\u201d wrote Callan. \u201cBut the law requires something entirely different: a strict analysis of the facts and law by 12 ordinary citizens insulated from outside pressure.\u201d In legislative terms, last week was a sparkling triumph for Democrats. On Monday, Biden signed a trillion-dollar infrastructure bill that attracted bipartisan support and fulfilled a self-proclaimed goal of Trump, who never could make it happen in his four-year term. On Friday, the House passed an ambitious $1.9 trillion social spending bill, sending it to the Senate. And despite the challenge of inflation, the economy appears to be growing strongly. But at the same time, Democrats are in deep despair over Biden\u2019s falling approval rating and the prospect that their lease on power could be cancelled by voters a year from now in the midterm elections. In the Guardian, Robert Reich asked, \u201cWhat explains the wide gap now between how well the country is doing and how badly Biden and the Democrats are doing politically?\u201d \u201cIn two words: dashed hopes. After four years of Trump and a year and a half of deathly pandemic, most of the country was eager to put all the horror behind \u2013 to start over, wipe the slate clean, heal the wounds, reboot America. Biden in his own calm way seemed just the person to do it.\u201d But he couldn\u2019t do it all quickly, and Covid\u2019s Delta variant set the country back. \u201cHopefully, a year from now the fruits of Biden\u2019s initiatives will be felt, Covid will be behind us, bottlenecks behind the current inflation will be overcome, and the horrors of the Trump years will become more visible through Congress\u2019s investigations and the midterm campaigns of Trumpers.\u201d It really is all about Covid, wrote Julian Zelizer. \u201cCovid-19 ravaged the world and inflicted an enormous death toll while upending our way of life, widening racial and economic disparities, and inflicting a psychological toll that could have a lasting impact on people for years to come.\u201d That\u2019s why Biden won, but, Zelizer observed, \u201cToo often, Biden has not done enough to explain how his legislative push is as integral to our country\u2019s recovery as the vaccine rollout.\u201d Former Rep. Charlie Dent, a Republican, offered a different explanation for the President\u2019s troubles. \u201cBiden presented himself successfully to Democratic primary voters in 2020 as a moderate alternative to Sen. Bernie Sanders, who advocated for expansive and transformative government. Sanders and his message lost. And since Biden wasn\u2019t elected by his party to go big, why is he pandering to Sanders and the left wing, which has resulted in a bloated Build Back Better bill?\u201d  One wild card in the run-up to the 2022 midterms lies with a case before the US Supreme Court that could overturn Roe v. Wade, the decision that made abortion legal nationwide. A new poll found that \u201cfewer than a third of Americans want Roe to be overturned,\u201d wrote Jill Filipovic. \u201cIf the Supreme Court overturns Roe either formally or functionally \u2013 by allowing states vast leeway to curtail abortion rights \u2013 the Court and the Republican Party may see just how much of a minority abortion opponents actually are, how crucial abortion and contraception are for American women to be free and how angry women (and those who love them) will get when our rights to our own bodies are taken away by five or six conservative judges who are unaccountable to the voting public. The GOP faces a guaranteed backlash if the anti-abortion movement gets what it wants\u2026\u201d For more: Priya Fielding-Singh and Ilana Raskind: The Americans who are getting the worst of the surge in inflation Fatima Goss Graves, Kristin Rowe-Finkbeiner and Ai-jen Poo:  Congress is one step closer to fulfilling its promise to women voters Lincoln Mitchell: How Kamala Harris can save her vice presidency Two men found guilty of the 1965 assassination of Malcolm X were finally exonerated Thursday after a review initiated by the Manhattan District Attorney\u2019s office found that they had not received a fair trial. Only one of them was alive to see justice served. \u201cThese exonerations are especially relevant now,\u201d wrote Peniel E. Joseph, \u201cnot only because they represent another instance of Black defendants receiving unfair treatment before the justice system but because they reframe history at a moment when the failures of that system continue to reverberate through national politics in the United States\u2026 \u201cThe right to a fair trial, presumption of innocence and an investigation led by ethical servants of the public trust is sacrosanct \u2013 yet, in large parts of this nation, woefully absent then \u2013 and for some, now.

That was the question Nicole Hemmer took on in a piece that led with the civil suit seeking to hold the organizers of a far right rally accountable for the 2017 Charlottesville, Virginia, confrontation that resulted in the death of counter-protester Heather Heyer. \u201cCourts are currently clogged with cases that chart much of the right-wing extremism and misinformation campaigns of the last decade. The cases also reveal the makeshift nature of legal responses to those campaigns, an array of tools that might be able to act as deterrents \u2014 though not able to deliver real justice.\u201d \u201cIt is at once both dispiriting and hopeful,\u201d Hemmer observed. \u201cDispiriting, because it is a sign of how rapidly the far-right has grown and how deeply it has penetrated US politics. Hopeful, because it shows how robustly the legal system is responding to the twin dangers of extremism and disinformation.\u201d Fareed Zakaria: Where Xi\u2019s China is heading Amy Bass: What Peng Shuai\u2019s disappearance means for upcoming Beijing Olympics John D.

The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion on CNN. President Joe Biden is getting closer to another major victory in what could be a legislative hat trick to round out his first year in office. After House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy delayed a vote in the lower chamber with an eight-hour speech last night, Democrats passed the Build Back Better Act, which is now expected to undergo major revisions in the Senate. Democrats, who have a razor-thin majority in the upper chamber, will have to see if they can get Democratic Senators Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema on board. Although the Congressional Budget Office issued a better-than-expected score which should help ease any reservations the two moderate senators might have about the overall cost, it is still far from clear whether Democrats can seal the deal. Passing the legislation would count as a landmark achievement. The $1.9 trillion bill would drastically expand the social safety net and help fight climate change by providing subsidies for health care and childcare, free and universal preschool for 3- and 4-year-olds, along with new tax credits for clean energy, investments in electric vehicles, and funding for environmental conservation. The bill will would also allow the federal government to negotiate the prices of prescription drugs for older Americans on Medicare, provide new and improved affordable housing, include subsidies to make high-speed internet more accessible \u2013 and more. If the legislation passes, Biden will be able to tout the Build Back Better Act, the American Rescue Plan and the $1 trillion infrastructure bill to join the ranks of the few Democrats since FDR who have been able to expand the role of the federal government in American life. In a sharp rebuke of Reaganism, Biden is building on the liberal legacy that stipulates government is essential to a healthy and equitable marketplace. There are many reasons why President Biden has struggled politically in recent months. When it comes to the administration\u2019s problems with messaging, its reticence may be an overcorrection after the Trump era. Given that so many Americans grew tired of the onslaught of tweets, announcements and reports covering the turbulence in the White House under Trump, Biden may have initially chosen to step back from the limelight, working behind closed doors to try to focus on the challenges of governing. This strategy proved to be effective at the start of Biden\u2019s presidency, since it created the perception that the federal government was operating smoothly. Why the tide may be turning on Trump But when pushing for big legislative initiatives, telling stories is part of what presidents do. Whenever the great Democratic presidents have successfully expanded the role of our government, they sold these laws to the American people as a way to address the major concerns of the day. Franklin Roosevelt\u2019s \u201cNew Deal\u201d was an effort to address one of the worst economic crises in US history, offering workers and farmers a new social safety net that would ensure the bottom would not again fall out for average Americans. Lyndon B. Johnson\u2019s \u201cGreat Society\u201d was an effort to use the growing wealth of this country to make the nation better than it had ever been by grappling with perennial challenges of poverty, racism, and inadequate education. It wasn\u2019t just that Roosevelt or Johnson had pithy catchphrases\u2014those alone, as Harry Truman learned with the \u201cFair Deal\u201d are not enough to guarantee success. It was the ability of these presidents to connect the dots between their proposals and the most pertinent concerns of the era in order to make a compelling case to the American people that these legislative packages were critical to the country\u2019s future. For Americans in 2021, nothing comes close to the pandemic and the problems it exposed and exacerbated. The nation and the world, lived through one of the most traumatic and unsettling crises of recent decades. Covid-19 ravaged the world and inflicted an enormous death toll while upending our way of life, widening racial and economic disparities, and inflicting a psychological toll that could have a lasting impact on people for years to come. While we are all focused on returning to some semblance of normality as soon as possible, the notion that we can simply move on or that the damage of the pandemic can easily be undone is shortsighted. Joe Biden won the 2020 election over Donald Trump for many reasons, one of which was a desperate desire for efficient and coherent leadership that could help us all climb out of the desperate state the pandemic put us in. As Biden tries to push his capstone legislation toward final passage by Christmas, he has to come back to this basic concern. Too often, Biden has not done enough to explain how his legislative push is as integral to our country\u2019s recovery as the vaccine rollout.  In the last few days, the administration has finally started to push back against inflation hawks by explaining how the infrastructure bill and the Build Back Better package would actually reduce basic costs for American families. But he needs to do more by laying out what\u2019s in these bills and how they\u2019ll make a positive impact on millions of Americans. Lowering the cost of health care and child care while providing support for caregiving jobs, for example, addresses longstanding problems that came to the forefront during the pandemic. More aggressive efforts to deal with climate change is also part of how we avoid another global crisis from unfolding. The more Biden can do to explain how his agenda addresses the Covid-19 pandemic and how his policies will make us more resilient going forward, the more pressure he can exert on Senators Manchin and Sinema to finally join the rest of their party in moving forward with this historic legislation.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Sign up to get our weekly column as a newsletter. We\u2019re looking back at the strongest, smartest opinion takes of the week from CNN and other outlets. \u201cTake a straw and throw it up into the air,\u201d English historian John Selden wrote in a book published in 1689, \u201cyou shall see by that which way the wind is.\u201d Last week\u2019s off-year election was one such straw in the wind. It drove the conversation \u2013 not necessarily because most people around the country care who serves as governor in New Jersey and Virginia, two states that collectively make up only about 5% of the US population. But it served as a signal of what may be to come: a defeat for Democrats who are trying to hold onto control of Congress in next November\u2019s national vote. \u201cStraws in the wind, is it all ending?\u201d so sang Australian rockers King Gizzard & The Lizard Wizard in their 2020 single. Or, to quote Bob Dylan, \u201cYou don\u2019t need a weatherman, to know which way the wind blows.\u201d In Virginia, it was a \u201cwipeout\u201d for Democrats, wrote Paul Begala. \u201cIf DC Dems can\u2019t unite and make life better for working families, they will be swept away in the same flood that wiped them out in Virginia.\u201d While Democratic leaders in Congress were trying \u2013 and repeatedly failing \u2013 to pass bills to rebuild roads, bridges and other infrastructure and to strengthen the social safety net, Virginia\u2019s Republican gubernatorial candidate Glenn Youngkin \u201cshamelessly exploited racial divisions with his virtually fact-free assertion that critical race theory (CRT) is poisoning the minds of the schoolchildren of Virginia,\u201d Begala wrote. CRT isn\u2019t even taught in Virginia, and Begala called discussions of it a \u201cdog whistle\u201d to stir racial animosity. \u201cBut cynical, divisive racial appeals find more fertile soil when Democrats can\u2019t deliver. The middle-class American dream is why God created the Democratic Party.\u201d Likely with that in mind, House Democrats passed the trillion-dollar infrastructure bill late Friday, sending a major legislative accomplishment to President Joe Biden\u2019s desk for signature. \u201cA big win helps change the narrative,\u201d wrote David Axelrod, \u201cand, coupled with news of a positive jobs report and a new antiviral Covid-19 pill, the end of the week was as upbeat as the beginning was dark for this White House.\u201d He said it \u201cwas an essential benchmark for Biden and the Democrats, who need to show a solid body of work if they have any hope of cutting through the brutal midterm headwinds in 2022.\u201d There were dozens of takes on what went wrong for Youngkin\u2019s Democratic rival Terry McAuliffe, but SE Cupp zeroed in on a key factor: \u201cIt was actually pretty darn simple: Don\u2019t mess with moms \u2026 Suburban women got Youngkin over the finish line, big time.\u201d McAuliffe made the mistake of saying, \u201cI don\u2019t think parents should be telling schools what they should teach,\u201d as Cupp pointed out. \u201cImagine saying that in Virginia, a state that already has a healthy number of homes-choolers, and where, during the pandemic, families were forced to teach at home because of statewide school closures,\u201d said Cupp. \u201cTo this group of people McAuliffe decided to essentially say, you shouldn\u2019t be in charge of your kids\u2019 education \u2013 I should.\u201d The story in Virginia, in Peniel E. Joseph\u2019s view, \u201cis really one about how easy it is to weaponize White anger for political gain. We are witnessing a backlash against the racial justice protests that rocked the US and the world in the wake of George Floyd\u2019s murder in Minneapolis on May 25, 2020 \u2026 White parents\u2019 fear and anxiety over some kind of conspiracy to destroy suburban schoolchildren through the teaching of CRT taps into a deeper well of racial resentment than is being openly discussed enough in the aftermath of Tuesday\u2019s election.\u201d In the Atlantic, Yascha Mounk noted that \u201cYoungkin capitalized on a widespread public perception that Democrats are out of tune with the country on cultural issues. In doing so, he demonstrated that Republicans who attack identity politics without embracing Trump\u2019s extremist rhetoric can be highly competitive in purple and even solidly blue states (such as New Jersey, where another gubernatorial election that was meant to be an easy win for Democrats has turned out to be unexpectedly close).\u201d  What should Biden do? Julian Zelizer pointed out that voters supported Biden in the 2020 election because they \u201cyearned for competence and normality.\u201d But that \u201cdidn\u2019t just mean they wanted a President who avoided Twitter and refrained from firing White House staff in dramatic, made for television announcements. He understood Americans wanted a President who could actually tackle the nation\u2019s biggest problems.\u201d \u201cCompetence means governance and problem-solving. It means getting things done, so voters can see tangible results. The New Deal was successful not because it offered voters some grand ideological vision of society, but because President Franklin Roosevelt addressed the problems Americans faced by providing public jobs, electrifying rural areas, building roads and bridges and creating unemployment insurance and Social Security.\u201d Two of the people in charge of running elections in swing states sounded the alarm about the 2022 vote. Michigan Secretary of State Jocelyn Benson and her Arizona counterpart, Katie Hobbs, wrote, \u201cThose against democracy have spent this year showing us there may be no \u2018bottom\u2019 to how far they will go to lie, deceive, and interfere with the will of the voters. It\u2019s time we believe them, and get to work spending every day of this next year working to make telling the truth and protecting democracy a paramount focus of our time.\u201d It\u2019s safe to say the next 12 months will be a time of high political anxiety. In a piece adapted from her new book, \u201cSaving Grace,\u201d CNN senior political analyst Kirsten Powers shared some advice for handling it. \u201cIn 2018, barely two years into the Trump era, I hit a wall,\u201d Powers wrote. \u201cI was in a near-constant state of agitation, emotionally and physically exhausted and with contempt coursing through my veins for large swaths of people I had never even met. If this state had been helpful to anyone or any cause I cared about, perhaps it would have been worth it. But it wasn\u2019t. America felt as divided and toxic as it had ever been in my lifetime. Little did I know, we were just getting warmed up.\u201d \u201cAs we head into the midterm election season with so much hanging in the balance, grace just might be what helps you, and even our country, survive.\u201d Glenn Youngkin dressed for the campaign in dark red fleece vests, going tieless in contrast to Donald Trump\u2019s bright red neckwear. And he kept the former President at arm\u2019s length, wrote Scott Jennings. He \u201cfocused on his own brand and on issues that were top of mind for local voters, instead of on a Trump-centric or Trump-style campaign that relied on rotating grievances and personal pique.\u201d \u201cYoungkin firmly rejected the January 6 Capitol riot and didn\u2019t prejudge the integrity of the election, although Trump played footsie with that message in some of his personal statements in the weeks leading up to Election Day. And it didn\u2019t drive any Republicans away from his campaign, apparently, contrary to what Trump argued a few weeks ago when he said Republicans wouldn\u2019t vote unless the GOP made election security its top (and only?) issue.\u201d Alice Stewart wrote that \u201cMcAuliffe and the Democrats wasted valuable time and resources on campaigning against Donald Trump and falsely linking Youngkin to the former President. This strategy was a costly miscalculation. Virginia voters realized Trump was not on the ballot.\u201d It\u2019s true, observed Frida Ghitis, that \u201cDemocrats have much soul-searching to do. But Republicans, whether they admit it or not, have a huge problem on their hands.\u201d They can win independent voters but \u201conly if they keep the defeated former President Donald Trump at arm\u2019s length. But how long can they do that? The fact is, Republicans would have a good chance of winning the White House in 2024 \u2013 if they get someone other than Trump to win the nomination.\u201d Trump is, so far, the clear front-runner for that nod. Complicating the picture for Republicans is the role of conservative media, especially voices like Tucker Carlson of Fox News. His three-part series on Fox Nation depicted the January 6 rioters as \u201crighteous patriots, drawn to the nation\u2019s capital by a mix of concern about the validity of the election results and FBI entrapment,\u201d wrote Nicole Hemmer. \u201cCarlson\u2019s aim with this false narrative is to forge a brand of populist conservatism with former President Donald Trump at its head, built for and around aggrieved, besieged \u2018legacy Americans\u2019 \u2013 Carlson\u2019s nativist term for White people whose families have lived in the United States for generations.\u201d Hemmer\u2019s key takeaway: \u201cWhatever direction Trumpism goes next, it will still have at its heart violent conspiracies and a deep suspicion of democracy. There\u2019s nothing truly conservative \u2013 or American \u2013 about any of it.\u201d The newly elected mayor of New York City, Eric Adams, was among many Democrats urging swift action on the bills that would enact Biden\u2019s \u201cBuild Back Better\u201d agenda. Writing for CNN Opinion, Adams argued that helping America\u2019s cities is vital \u201cif our country is going to recover from Covid-19 and reach new heights, because the truth is that our cities power our country \u2026 Our representatives must do the smart thing \u2013 and the right thing \u2013 and pass Biden\u2019s plans to bring America back.\u201d The infrastructure bill languished in the House for months as progressives pushed for certainty that all of the Senate Democrats would vote for the social spending bill, which has been cut from $3.5 trillion to $1.75 trillion as a result of objections from Sens. Joe Manchin and Kyrsten Sinema. \u201cWe are told daily that since Biden has only 50 Democratic votes in the Senate, Manchin and Sinema hold all the cards, and that in effect the lobbyists have triumphed,\u201d wrote economist Jeffrey D. Sachs. \u201cYet that is a disastrously defeatist perspective. It means surrendering on crucial measures without a fight, which is what Biden and the other Democratic leaders seem to be doing. Yet would Franklin Roosevelt, Harry Truman or Lyndon Johnson have folded their hands because a couple of Democratic senators were siding with lobbyists?\u201d Few MLB teams have done as poorly as the Atlanta Braves did before reaching \u2013 and winning \u2013 the World Series last week. As Terence Moore wrote, they were still below .500 in early August. Jorge Soler was hitting an anemic .192 when he was acquired by the Braves mid-season. He hit three homers in the series and won the MVP award. Atlanta celebrated its first Series title in 26 years, but there were mixed feelings. \u201cEven though the Braves are a nightmare for anybody into social justice, they\u2019re also a dream for those of us hugging miracles,\u201d Moore wrote. \u201cMost strikingly, Braves officials refused to get rid of the chopping and the chanting. They encouraged it during games with a digital image \u2013 on all of the ballpark\u2019s video boards \u2013 of a tomahawk going up and down. Even miracle workers have a lot to improve on before next season.\u201d The novel approach Texas conservatives took to try to undo Roe. v. Wade ran into trouble this week in the US Supreme Court, where even two justices on the right expressed doubts about the new law. It essentially deputizes private citizens to enforce a ban on most abortions after about six weeks of pregnancy by allowing them to file lawsuits against clinics, doctors and anyone who helps a woman get the medical procedure. But Mary Ziegler said abortion-rights activists shouldn\u2019t take much comfort. \u201cWhile the law has been in effect, people in Texas have been forced to travel out of state for abortions, causing serious overcrowding in neighboring states. Pregnant women have to risk their lives to travel out of state to manage ectopic pregnancies; the law\u2019s narrow medical emergency exception scares physicians away from providing necessary care. Blocking SB8, or striking it down, would save Texas women from this nightmare,\u201d Ziegler wrote. \u201cBut in the long term, siding against Texas more likely means that the court has tired of the proxy war on Roe and is ready for a more direct attack. If the court\u2019s conservative majority wanted to dismantle Roe, there were always multiple ways of doing so.\u201d Jill Filipovic: Here\u2019s the answer to your holiday supply-chain worries Don Lincoln: The problem with the Big Bang theory Tim Spector: Long Covid is real. But there are ways to protect yourself Dr. Kent Sepkowitz: The case for Covid boosters just got stronger Sara Stewart: Why this GenX-er is jealous of Gen Z Robert Redford: What I see when I think about the future David Perry: What Josh Hawley gets right \u2013 and so very wrong \u2013 about being a man AND \u2026 Marvel Studios\u2019 newest film, \u201cEternals,\u201d stars Angelina Jolie, Salma Hayek and Kumail Nanjiani and is based on a 1976 comic book by Jack Kirby. As Roy Schwartz wrote, \u201cKirby, who died in 1994, was foundational to the success of the Marvel Cinematic Universe as it currently exists \u2026 no other comic book artist has had a bigger impact on the field.\u201d Kirby, born Jacob Kurtzberg, the son of Jewish immigrants from Austria, dropped out of Pratt Institute at 14 but went on to have a remarkable career, Schwartz noted. \u201cHis legacy far exceeds comics and superheroes. His signature style \u2013 a fusion of pivotal artistic movements such as cubism, expressionism, surrealism, avant-garde, op art, Indigenous South American, midcentury commercial and futurism, blended into a visual language all his own \u2013 and its innovation in composition, dynamism and design, can be found today in virtually all forms of visual media and art, from film to advertising to photography \u2026\u201d \u201cKirby\u2019s significance to comics is like Shakespeare\u2019s to literature; the great master of the form, the virtuoso who coined much of its idioms and tropes, forever its highest standard. He may not be a household name but his influence, direct and indirect, can be seen practically everywhere. He is a founding father of modern popular culture. Like his latest creation to reach the big screen, the King\u2019s influence is eternal.\u201d",

View more opinion articles on CNN. Efforts to diagnose Democratic defeat in Virginia, a state which has trended reliably blue in recent years due to its northern suburbs and which President Biden won by 10 points, have missed the mark. In assessing Terry McAuliffe\u2019s loss to Glenn Youngkin, Democrats have been blamed for advocating a left-wing agenda while failing to marshal an effective strategy to counter right-wing racist dog-whistling \u2013 specifically around imagined support for so-called Critical Race Theory (in reality, an academic framework for understanding institutional racism; in right-wing fantasy, any mention of racism\u2019s horrors in the classroom). This GOP talking point became a productive bogeyman, allowing the GOP to assert falsely that White children will be emotionally stunted by progressivism run amok. Despite local victories for candidates like Michelle Wu, the new mayor of Boston, the election of centrist former police officer Eric Adams as New York City\u2019s mayor and the defeat of a policing reform measure in Minneapolis are also being painted into this \u201cDemocrats lost because they\u2019re not moderate enough\u201d narrative. It\u2019s true that one year before a 2022 midterm election that, historically, signals major losses in Congress for the party in power, the Democrats have started to succumb to a narrative of decline partially of their own making. But the story here is really one about how easy it is to weaponize White anger for political gain. We are witnessing a backlash against the racial justice protests that rocked the US and the world in the wake of George Floyd\u2019s murder in Minneapolis on May 25, 2020. White voters in Virginia, hoodwinked by the charges that Terry McAuliffe supported something\u2014CRT\u2014that is not and has never been taught in Virginia or any public school in America illustrates the depth and breadth of the problem of anti-Black racism in American today. White parents\u2019 fear and anxiety over some kind of conspiracy to destroy suburban school children through the teaching of CRT taps into a deeper well of racial resentment than is being openly discussed enough in the aftermath of Tuesday\u2019s election. Controversy over 'Beloved' is so much bigger than one book The racial politics of the \u201cparental control\u201d debate over what children are being taught in schools has a long and ugly history that is intimately connected to White fears of racial integration in the broadest possible sense. Fear of Black history being taught in predominantly White schools is simply the latest racial anxiety to be weaponized for partisan gain. Part of the losses on Tuesday were also triggered by bad optics. The disastrous US withdrawal from Afghanistan allowed conservatives to portray President Joe Biden as feckless and weak. Continued global supply chain issues related to the Covid-19 pandemic continue to hurt businesses. Inflation rates have reached uncomfortable highs for consumers unused to sharp increases in the price of groceries and other goods. Congressional Democrats\u2019 inability to forge a meaningful coalition willing to commit to Biden\u2019s legislative agenda has been perhaps the biggest blow. Efforts to pass the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act, voting rights reforms and a $3.5 trillion spending bill that promised game-changing policies for vulnerable Americans were all, at least in part, stymied by party infighting. Two US senators, West Virginia\u2019s Joe Manchin and Arizona\u2019s Krysten Sinema, have become the targets of vociferous criticism from within the Democratic Party for resisting efforts to end the filibuster, pass voting rights legislation or support the full measure of Biden\u2019s legislative agenda. Battling election misinformation is key for democracy in 2022 And then there\u2019s Critical Race Theory. The assaults against CRT are a 21st-century echo of the Lost Cause mythology that attacked Reconstruction as a failed effort to grant citizenship to formerly enslaved Black Americans long before they were ready or capable of such an awesome responsibility. The falsehood of this narrative made it no less effective. Public school textbooks and teachers, North and South, taught aspects of the Lost Cause for more than a century. Some are still teaching it. Anti-CRT legislation successfully passed in states such as Texas and used as a wedge issue in the Virginia gubernatorial election, traffics in lies and falsehoods that are, nonetheless, stunningly effective. Teaching Black history is not Critical Race Theory, but it has been treated as such in hundreds of school districts where White parents are screaming that they don\u2019t want their children to be taught CRT. What are these White parents and voters so afraid of? Videos of White voters and pundits of all colors attacking CRT while simultaneously being unable to explain what it is offer us potent clues to what\u2019s happening in America right now. Attacks on CRT, through legislation, threats and falsehoods, represent a modern-day extension of White backlash against any and all hopes of racial justice in America. This backlash now, just as during Reconstruction and the civil rights era, is marked by legislative efforts to roll back perceived gains by African Americans. \u201cCRT\u201d is now fixed firmly in the tortured and impactful history of racial code words in American politics. Richard Nixon\u2019s \u201csouthern strategy\u201d turned the Republican Party from a regional power into a national juggernaut through the use of language\u2014\u201dlaw and order\u201d\u2014understood by White voters as a pragmatic and political recognition of Black criminality. SE Cupp: This is the REAL reason Democrats lost in Virginia Ronald Reagan\u2019s use of the term \u201cwelfare queen\u201d while running for the Republican presidential nomination in 1976 coded welfare with Black women, something Daniel Patrick Moynihan\u2019s myth of the Black \u201cmatriarch\u201d had already laid the groundwork for over a decade earlier. Lee Atwater\u2019s Willie Horton campaign turned the 1988 presidential race into a referendum on race and crime, with suitably positive results for George H.W. Bush at the expense of the country\u2019s moral compass. Democrats have capitalized on racial coding too, with Bill Clinton\u2019s crime and welfare policies engineered to attracted White suburban votes through punitive policies that punished already vulnerable community with jail and the absence of a safety net. Donald Trump\u2019s messaging lacked all subtlety but proved effective, turning the politics of racial cruelty into state-of-the-art brutalist theater. This is not going to be fixed in one election or by the next election cycle. More troublesome than the false rhetoric opposing CRT is the way in which its effectiveness has become a Trojan horse to continue the erosion of democracy. Many of the same folks attacking CRT also support voter suppression legislation, gerrymandering and law and order rhetoric\u2014the exact policies that have gotten the nation into this current mess.  The Democrats have an identity problem, with moderates and progressive unable and at times unwilling to forge common ground and, in the process, ceding much of our democracy to a Republican Party that has already proven itself, based on the GOP response to the January 6 insurrection, unfit for such responsibility. The larger problem, however, is the willingness of White voters to embrace coded racial language that is being used, once again, to foment manufactured divisions that divert the nation\u2019s and the media\u2019s attention from confronting the real challenges of racial and economic inequality. These are the existential crises that Americans must face.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Paul Begala, a Democratic strategist and CNN political commentator, was a political consultant for Bill Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign in 1992 and served as a counselor to Clinton in the White House. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his. View more opinion articles on CNN. Democrats, who have dominated Virginia for years \u2013 and who won the Old Dominion in a landslide for Joe Biden just a year ago \u2013 were washed away in a red tide. They lost both the governorship and the lieutenant governorship. It was a wipeout. Why? That is the question that will dominate Democrats\u2019 chatter as they gather over their organic, GMO-free, chai tea with soy milk. The denial caucus will tell us to pay no attention to an off-off year election. They\u2019ll probably say Terry McAuliffe ran a bad campaign. Baloney. And that the Virginia election was just a heartburn. I say it\u2019s more like a heart attack. I believe the Dems\u2019 defeat was a result of history, Democratic divisions and a Republican Party that is learning how to exploit racial and cultural issues \u2026 without wholeheartedly embracing Donald Trump. In 11 of the last 12 elections, Virginia has elected a governor from the party opposite of the president. The one exception: McAuliffe, who won in 2013, the year after Barack Obama won re-election. Pumping the brake pedal is a sensible reaction for many Virginians. It\u2019s sensible to many other Americans as well. The party of a newly-elected president usually gets hammered in the next midterm election. Donald Trump\u2019s GOP lost 41 House seats in 2018. Barack Obama\u2019s Democrats dropped 63.  Biden\u2019s Democrats can\u2019t afford to lose more than three if they want to retain control of the House. The GOP's Trump-free campaign in Virginia worked But brake-pedal equilibrium is just the beginning of the Democrats\u2019 challenges. There is also the circular firing squad formed by congressional Democrats, which both depressed the Democratic base and alienated the suburban swing voters on whom their majority rested. Every day, those progressive Democrats bemoaned a cherished priority that was being cut from Biden\u2019s infrastructure bill \u2013 laments that depressed core Democrats. Not to be outdone, moderate Democrats focused on the trillion-dollar-plus price tag, which told suburban voters that they needed to hit the brakes on spending. The final factor that swung the commonwealth was a GOP nominee who was savvy (or, some might say, cynical) enough to embrace much of former president Donald Trump\u2019s agenda to rally the MAGA crowd, but was different enough stylistically to reassure suburbanites. Democrats often win by focusing on kitchen-table economic issues. Republicans, on the other hand, win when middle-class voters are more concerned about cultural issues. Since the Democrats were not able to deliver on kitchen-table economics, the GOP was able to drive a wedge into the Democratic coalition with cultural issues. Glenn Youngkin shamelessly exploited racial divisions with his virtually fact-free assertion that critical race theory is poisoning the minds of the schoolchildren of Virginia. \u201cWe actually have this critical race theory moved into all of our schools in Virginia,\u201d he dishonestly claimed. Never mind that Politifact reports that \u201cCritical race theory is not mentioned in Virginia\u2019s Standards of Learning.\u201d  Critical Race Theory was a dog whistle. In fact, some progressives have argued that CRT stands for Creating Racial Tension. I agree. But cynical, divisive racial appeals find more fertile soil when Democrats can\u2019t deliver.  The middle-class American Dream is why God created the Democratic Party. If DC Dems can\u2019t unite and make life better for working families, they will be swept away in the same flood that wiped them out in Virginia.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Sign up to get our new weekly column as a newsletter. We\u2019re looking back at the strongest, smartest opinion takes of the week from CNN and other outlets. \u201cBe afraid,\u201d Geena Davis\u2019 character said in the 1986 movie, \u201cThe Fly.\u201d \u201cBe very afraid.\u201d That chilling line came, oddly enough, from comedy impresario Mel Brooks. His company produced the film, which echoes the dreadful narrative of the classic novella, \u201cThe Metamorphosis.\u201d Franz Kafka\u2019s story begins: \u201cAs Gregor Samsa awoke one morning from uneasy dreams he found himself transformed in his bed into a gigantic insect.\u201d This Halloween people have more than dreams and giant insects to be uneasy about. Last week, a man stood up at a right-wing youth activist rally to ask, in effect, whether it\u2019s time to shoot the winners when Republicans lose elections. A US senator defended a man who gave a Nazi salute as a protest at a school board meeting. And a Republican member of Congress tried to justify the January 6 Capitol insurrection as a case of people opposing tyranny. As The Washington Post reported, last winter members of former President Donald Trump\u2019s team set up a \u201ccommand center\u201d in Washington\u2019s Willard Hotel to push the false election fraud narrative that dozens of judges around the country had already rejected and to encourage then Vice President Mike Pence to refuse to certify Joe Biden\u2019s victory, as the law required him to do. \u201cThis is what an attempted coup looks like,\u201d wrote Dean Obeidallah. \u201cCoups are not just tanks rolling in the streets. It\u2019s an illegal attempt to overturn the will of the people to retain political power. And if the organizers of the failed coup are not punished, what\u2019s to stop them from attempting another in the future?\u201d It was at a Turning Point USA event at Boise State University Monday that a member of the audience asked organizer Charlie Kirk, \u201cHow many elections are they going to steal before we kill these people?\u201d SE Cupp said, \u201cNow, to his credit, Kirk denounced the idea of, you know, killing people because you don\u2019t like election results. Not because it\u2019s wrong, but because, quote, \u2018they want that.\u2019\u201d \u201cImagine how low we\u2019ve sunk as a country, how deranged, how conspiratorial and vicious we\u2019ve become,\u201d said Cupp, \u201cwhen this is an actual idea floated \u2013 publicly, out in the open for anyone to hear.\u201d Another bizarre moment came in a US Senate hearing room. \u201cYou have to hand it to Sen. Ted Cruz,\u201d wrote Frida Ghitis. \u201cHis timing was impeccable. On the anniversary of the deadliest attack on Jews in US history, Cruz raised his voice in the Senate to defend an American\u2019s right to brandish the Nazi salute. \u2018My God!\u2019 he exclaimed as he slammed his desk, railing at Attorney General Merrick Garland during a hearing Wednesday over the Justice Department\u2019s attempt to address harassment and threats of violence at public school board meetings. \u2018A parent did a Nazi salute at a school board because they thought the policies were oppressive!\u2019 Then he asked Garland, \u2018is doing a Nazi salute \u2026 protected by the First Amendment?\u2019 Garland responded calmly. \u2018Yes, it is.\u2019\u201d But free speech isn\u2019t the real issue here, Ghitis observed. \u201cThe issue is whether Americans and their political leaders will act on the basis of a higher principle than political point-scoring, and ultimately be able to douse the flames of hatred and division that are weakening the country. Ted Cruz, it seems, doesn\u2019t get it.\u201d Stoking division in America has long been the aim of right-wing extremists who peddle \u201cWhite Replacement Theory,\u201d noted Michael D\u2019Antonio and James Cohen. Only now, some on the right are trying to mainstream the idea. \u201cWith the midterm elections on the horizon, influential talkers on Fox News and some of Trump\u2019s more prominent surrogates are pushing the \u2018Replacement Theory\u2019 \u2026 Tucker Carlson has even gone so far as to declare the Democrats are implementing an actual plan to change the nation\u2019s racial makeup for some malign purpose.\u201d Ahead of Tuesday\u2019s election for governor of Virginia, Republican candidate Glenn Youngkin released an ad starring an activist, \u201cLaura Murphy, who campaigned against the teaching of (Toni) Morrison\u2019s Pulitzer Prize-winning novel, \u2018Beloved,\u2019 on the grounds the story\u2019s grueling depiction of racial violence gave her son \u2013 then a high school senior \u2013 nightmares,\u201d wrote Peniel E. Joseph. The Nobel laureate\u2019s \u201cwork calls upon all Americans, but especially our young people, to interrogate the past to create a better democratic future,\u201d Joseph observed. \u201cCensoring the American past does not make White students less vulnerable to feelings of despair about the challenges of racial inequity, discrimination and violence we face as a nation.\u201d For more: Michael D\u2019Antonio: Trump\u2019s ridiculous falsehood-filled letter to The Wall Street Journal Joe Lockhart: Democrats, if you want to win, get tough Ruth Ben-Ghiat: The problem with Ron DeSantis\u2019 mini-Trump pose Jim Kolbe and Miles Taylor: How the specter of Trump haunts the House Rob Ackerman headed the prop department for Saturday Night Live\u2019s film unit for 20 years. \u201cDuring our most difficult moments, I reminded my team that this was fun, a form of make-believe for grown-ups, an honorable and blessed craft,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWe had to stay alert and persist \u2026 it was always about keeping our collective eye on the ball.\u201d What Ackerman has heard about conditions on the set of the movie \u201cRust\u201d has disturbed him \u2013 and many others. Cinematographer Halyna Hutchins was killed on that set as Alec Baldwin was practicing drawing a prop gun during rehearsals on October 21. The investigation is still ongoing, but media reports have raised many questions. As Ackerman noted, \u201cA gun was accidentally discharged at least twice earlier in the film shoot, according to The Wall Street Journal, citing accounts of \u2018people familiar with the daily operations of the production.\u2019 And accounts that a slew of camera crew workers walked off the job just ahead of the fatal shooting incident speak volumes. How many red flags does a production need?\u201d Legal analyst Paul Callan wrote, \u201cSomething had to be seriously amiss on the set of \u2018Rust\u2019 for this tragic shooting to occur. Who put live rounds in a gun that was supposed to be loaded with blanks, if anything at all? Why would any live rounds ever be placed in a gun slated for use by an actor on set?\u201d Dave Brown helped write the online training course in gun safety for theater and film technicians. \u201cI don\u2019t love guns,\u201d he wrote. \u201cBut as a firearms safety specialist, they are the tools of my profession. I respect them, and I teach others to respect them too. After 30 years of working with firearms in the film industry, I\u2019ve learned one very important lesson: When handled responsibly, firearms are as safe as any other prop on a film set. \u201cThe difference is firearms require the undivided attention of an experienced expert. There is zero tolerance for error. If actors make a mistake on set, they get another take. If the weapons handler makes a mistake, it could end a life.\u201d Syra Madad is ready. As early as this week, shots could be going into the arms of children aged 5 to 11, the latest group to be included in the Covid-19 vaccination program that has markedly reduced the spread and severity of the disease. And Madad, an epidemiologist in New York, says she plans to have her children vaccinated \u2013 two of the three are in the newly included age group. \u201cOnce inoculated, they will be at a decreased risk of suffering from illness, hospitalization, long Covid and even death,\u201d Madad wrote. \u201cThey\u2019ll be less likely to have disruptions from their schooling, given that, once vaccinated, they will not have to quarantine every time they\u2019ve been exposed to someone who has Covid-19.\u201d It will be a big step toward normality, she added. \u201cWe will be able to go back to engaging in activities we enjoyed as a family, those that would be too high risk to do while they were unvaccinated. This includes traveling internationally, going to mixed indoor gatherings like weddings or to the movies, and dining at restaurants indoors.\u201d For more on Covid-19: Sonia Pruitt: Why are cops fighting vaccine mandates?

Maldonado: Why you should vaccinate your 5-to-11-year-old Dr. Moira Szilagyi: How to talk to your kids about the Covid-19 vaccines A flood of news reports painted a devastating portrait of Facebook\u2019s failure to control the rampant spread of misinformation that has had real and often harmful consequences around the world. Documents provided by former Facebook product manager Frances Haugen portrayed the company as one so eager for profits that its platform helped amplify anger. Jill Filipovic asked a fundamental question: \u201cAs damning information about Facebook leaves the company increasingly besieged by accusations that it does far too little to prevent misinformation, radicalization, human trafficking, girls\u2019 low self-esteem, hate speech and even physical violence, I\u2019m asking myself the same question a lot of people are: Why am I still on this platform?\u201d Facebook\u2019s chief executive, Mark Zuckerberg, made clear Thursday that he has his sights set on other things. He unveiled a new corporate name \u2013 \u201cMeta\u201d \u2013 for the company owning Facebook, Instagram and WhatsApp and invited us into his new \u201cmetaverse.\u201d As Douglas Rushkoff wrote, it is \u201cFacebook\u2019s proprietary new virtual world of worlds where we are supposed to do our working, playing and socializing forevermore.\u201d It\u2019s a striking, and perhaps scary, vision: \u201cInstead of making human facial expressions, our avatars can make iconic thumbs-up gestures,\u201d Rushkoff observed. \u201cInstead of sharing air and space together, we can collaborate on a digital document. We learn to downgrade our experience of being together with another human being to seeing their projection overlaid into the room like an augmented reality Pokemon figure. The less like humans and more like robots we can be, the more at home in the metaverse we will feel.\u201d For more: Kara Alaimo: It\u2019s time for social networks to take a close look in the mirror In a dizzying week of meetings, news conferences and speeches, Biden and the Democrats who control Congress may have inched closer to the passage of two bills that would provide nearly $3 trillion to rebuild America\u2019s physical infrastructure and to greatly expand its social spending. If progressives stand behind them and if two maverick senators remain on board, the bills could become law within weeks. The events, Russell Berman wrote in the Atlantic, \u201chave been confusing for seasoned veterans of the Capitol Hill sausage mill, not to mention the hundreds of congressional Democrats who must vote for the proposal and the millions of people whose lives stand to improve because of it. A brand-new billionaires\u2019 tax? In one day and out the next. Paid family leave? First 12 weeks, then four weeks, then gone altogether. Expanding Medicare and Medicaid? That depends on what Sen. Joe Manchin ate for breakfast. Biden and Democratic leaders \u2026 seem to be disassembling and then frantically reassembling a plane in the minutes before takeoff.\u201d In 1993, President Bill Clinton set an ambitious goal \u2013 a national health insurance program \u2013 and asked first lady Hillary Clinton to head the task force devising it. \u201cThe legislative negotiations were rocky,\u201d wrote historian Julian Zelizer. \u201cSmall employers rallied against the plan, running ads on television featuring a fictional couple \u2013 Harry and Louise \u2013 talking about how confusing and frightening the plan seemed to be. Republicans gradually coalesced against the legislation.\u201d Democrats split over aspects of the plan, and it died the next year. Months later, Republicans won control of both houses of Congress for the first time in 40 years. If Biden\u2019s agenda goes down to defeat, Zelizer warned, \u201cDemocrats once again will face the worst of all worlds. They won\u2019t have bold legislation to boast about when speaking to Democratic voters and they will have energized Republicans to attack the threat of big government liberalism going into the midterm campaigns.\u201d When Arizona Sen. Kyrsten Sinema nixed the idea of raising individual and corporate tax rates, many Democrats briefly rallied around the idea of a brand-new tax: on the assets controlled by billionaires, who often are able to escape paying meaningful amounts in taxes. \u201cThe plan,\u201d wrote tax expert Edward McCaffery, \u201crests on a surprisingly simple idea: that billionaires should pay tax on their incomes, just like tens of millions of working Americans do every year.\u201d The wealthy don\u2019t rely on paychecks and so can avoid the regular income tax, McCaffery explained. They can borrow money based on the increasing value of their investments and hold onto them \u2013 without paying taxes \u2013 till they die. The problem is long-standing. \u201cA century is a long time to wait for the wealthiest persons in the history of the world to pay something to their home country. And something is better than nothing.\u201d Biden\u2019s bills would commit half a trillion dollars to fight climate change. As he flew to Europe Thursday for the G20 summit and the COP26 climate conference, the world was watching, wrote David A. Andelman. \u201cClearly, he must act decisively at home if he is to sell himself abroad, particularly in the area of climate change, an area where Europe has found the United States wanting since the Paris accord was reached at COP21.\u201d One audience is watching particularly closely, wrote Britt Wray, a Human and Planetary Health fellow at Stanford University. \u201cIt\u2019s no secret that young people everywhere are worried sick about the climate crisis. Their heavily reported eco- or climate anxiety (now becoming familiar terms to many), have awoken adults to the mental health burden that a warming world puts on our children and youth. Recent research my colleagues and I conducted showed for the first time that this psychological distress is linked to feelings of government betrayal and being lied to by leaders who are failing to take adequate climate action \u2013 many while pretending to do otherwise.\u201d For more: Keith Magee: It\u2019s not just carbon emissions.

Morgan Ortagus and David Stilwell: The risks Americans face in traveling to China Reece Jones: How the Statue of Liberty became a symbol for a national myth AND \u2026 \u201cDonnie Darko\u201d was released 20 years ago, with the kind of ingredients that made it a cult movie: a cast including Jake and Maggie Gyllenhaal, Drew Barrymore, Seth Rogen, Patrick Swayze, Katharine Ross, Jena Malone, Noah Wyle and Beth Grant, a man in a giant bunny suit, teenage angst and the 1988 presidential election. \u201cI first discovered \u2018Donnie Darko\u2019 as a midnight movie in the East Village, years after its release,\u201d wrote critic Sara Stewart \u201cand have found myself going back to it around this time every year. But in 2021, its existential melancholy and cultural anxiety feel highly relevant, like director Richard Kelly pulled off a little time travel of his own and got a glimpse at the mess that is 2021. Its odd tone feels strangely familiar, as does the juxtaposition of suburbia\u2019s slightly manic sunniness with Donnie\u2019s growing sense of bewilderment, isolation and sense that something is very off.\u201d  That feeling is familiar to poet Tess Taylor. \u201cWhile I am fond of a good scare, Halloween this year feels different than the macabre, plasticked-up horror film version of the holiday that can run on repeat this time of year (cue spooky laugh here). It feels more like Samhain, the Celtic festival where the grave mounds open, where the light shifts and time thins, and where people might leave a bit of food out for their ghosts and honor their ancestors,\u201d Taylor wrote. \u201cAfter all, these have been harrowing times, times of real graveyards, real death on a scale most of us haven\u2019t really ever been asked to live through before. While plastic skulls and bones and witches are up on my house and around my neighborhood and probably yours, we each also live in shadow \u2013 of friends and family gone, and the wider, ricocheting losses of the pandemic \u2013 collapsed institutions, frayed health care systems, broken supply chains, shrunken public life.\u201d Taylor is still finding joy in the holiday. Her daughter is going to trick or treat today as a Dalmatian, her son as a werewolf. \u201cPerhaps next Halloween or the Halloween after will feel more carefree, more silly. But there\u2019s also a chance that this pandemic was partly a warning, a stern reminder of being a fragile species on a fragile earth.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Sign up to get our new weekly column as a newsletter. We\u2019re looking back at the strongest, smartest opinion takes of the week from CNN and other outlets. Donald Trump was 23 when the Rolling Stones released a seven-minute song that began with the voices of London\u2019s Bach Choir. \u201c\u2026No, you can\u2019t always get what you want, you can\u2019t always get what you want,\u201d the choristers sang, \u201c\u2026but if you try sometime you find, you get what you need.\u201d The song must have made an impression since Trump wound up using it regularly at his rallies, from the 2016 campaign on \u2013 until, after threats of legal action from the band, he replaced it with the Village People\u2019s \u201cY.M.C.A.\u201d The theme of wishes denied seems apt for Trump these days. The former President keeps railing against the 2020 election results, falsely claiming Joe Biden\u2019s victory was fraudulent. On Wednesday, he broke new ground by saying Republicans won\u2019t vote in 2022 and 2024 if \u201cwe don\u2019t solve the presidential election fraud of 2020\u2026It is the single most important thing for Republicans to do.\u201d But the election is settled \u2013 Trump can\u2019t get what he wants. \u201cFor someone who had talked an awful lot about being a winner,\u201d Michael D\u2019Antonio wrote, \u201cthis latest threat seems strange. But then again, he has done this kind of thing before.\u201d Trump\u2019s insistence on the voter fraud narrative likely discouraged Republicans from turning out in January\u2019s runoff election in Georgia, resulting in the Democrats taking control of the Senate. Another thing Trump wants is executive privilege \u2013 to quash fact-finding by the House select committee on the January 6 insurrection. He can\u2019t have that either, according to Norman Eisen and Dennis Aftergut. \u201cTrump is no longer \u2018the President.\u2019 In the United States we still only have one of those at a time \u2013 and President Joe Biden has not asserted privilege here. On the contrary, the Biden administration has cooperated with Congress, waiving privilege so far when it comes to witnesses and documents alike.\u201d Trump\u2019s former strategist Steve Bannon also wants to be shielded by executive privilege. \u201cEven if Trump could claim the privilege, it is hard to understand how it could apply to Bannon,\u201d Eisen and Aftergut wrote. \u201cThe House Committee is investigating events on and around January 6, 2021, and Trump fired Bannon in 2017.\u201d They backed the House committee\u2019s effort to recommend holding Bannon in criminal contempt for fighting its subpoena. As Susan Glasser noted in the New Yorker, \u201cThroughout his Presidency, Trump and his aides flouted congressional subpoenas and demands for information; he is once again instructing them to do so with the January 6th investigation, even though he is out of office and it is unclear if any executive privilege would still apply.\u201d Conservative columnist Henry Olsen wrote in the Washington Post that Trump\u2019s continued election lies create a \u201chuge headache\u201d for top GOP figures such as Mitch McConnell. The Senate minority leader should \u201cstart preparing to fight back. He knows that Trump\u2019s allegations are figments of his fevered imagination. It takes time to demolish each of the specific allegations that too many Republicans believe to be true. But without that exertion, those Republicans will continue to believe the election was stolen. And if they believe that, some might not vote at all. McConnell should not take that risk.\u201d The Stones originally recorded \u201cYou Can\u2019t Always Get What You Want\u201d in 1968, during a live performance that ended with John Lennon applauding enthusiastically in the audience. Lennon and his fellow Beatles had a friendly rivalry with Mick Jagger\u2019s band which survives to this day. In an interview with the New Yorker\u2019s David Remnick published last week, Paul McCartney dismissed the Rolling Stones as \u201ca blues cover band.\u201d In 1970, Lennon had famously accused the Stones of copying the Beatles\u2019 innovations \u201ctwo months after\u201d; some critics suggest that \u201cYou Can\u2019t Always Get What You Want\u201d is the Stones\u2019 answer to \u201cHey Jude,\u201d a seven-minute 1968 Beatles hit backed by a 36-piece orchestra. Trump\u2019s team has been known to play \u201cHey Jude\u201d at some rallies too. But the more disturbing thing at last weekend\u2019s rally in Iowa wasn\u2019t the music, according to Dean Obeidallah. It was the fealty that elected Republican officials, including some who denounced the election fraud narrative at first, showed to Trump. The rally \u201cwas attended by longtime Iowa US Sen. Chuck Grassley, Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds, Iowa Reps. Mariannette Miller-Meeks and Ashley Hinson, and other mainstream Republican officials. Some of these very same people, who just nine months ago were slamming Trump for his role in the Capitol riots, were now only too happy to be seen supporting him. This is politics at its worst \u2013 and at its most dangerous for our democracy.\u201d \u201cThe most hypocritical of the bunch is Sen. Grassley, who on January 6 was escorted by his security detail to a secure location to protect him from the pro-Trump mob that had laid siege on the Capitol.\u201d In Iowa, Grassley said, he \u201cwouldn\u2019t be too smart\u201d if he didn\u2019t accept \u201cthe endorsement of a person that\u2019s got 91 percent of the Republican voters in Iowa.\u201d As Obeidallah observed, \u201cTo Grassley, it was \u2018smart\u2019 to accept the endorsement of the man who spent Saturday\u2019s rally spouting the same falsehoods that led to the January 6 violence that caused Grassley to hide in fear.\u201d Now that in-person schooling is back in a big way, wrote Jennifer Wolfe, New York State\u2019s teacher of the year, \u201cstudents put on their masks and come to school \u2013 so happy to be together again\u2026it is the adults who are having trouble dealing with the changes in our world. Their fear gets in the way of learning the facts, of discussing openly and listening closely\u2026\u201d \u201cSchool board meetings have become a forum where scared and angry people descend on the one accessible government structure they feel they have the most control over and then, without filter or grace, hurl personal insults demanding somebody listen,\u201d Wolfe observed. Historian Ruth Ben-Ghiat asked a compelling question: \u201cWhat parent wouldn\u2019t want to keep their children safe by complying with best public health practices? Yet right-wing propaganda has effectively convinced many parents that masks are \u2018muzzles\u2019 of freedom and vaccine mandates tyrannical, spawning new waves of activists imbued with an intolerant \u2018us vs. them\u2019 mentality little in keeping with democratic models of civic life.\u201d \u201cThis translates into public bullying of parents who want to protect their children from Covid-19. In Los Angeles, anti-vaccine mandate protesters harassed parents at school drop-off. They claimed that masking is child abuse and subjecting children to vaccines a form of \u2018rape.\u2019\u201d Jon Gruden, former head coach of the Las Vegas Raiders, stepped down after emails surfaced showing his use of racist, homophobic and misogynistic language. \u201cI\u2019m sorry, I never meant to hurt anyone,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cBut Gruden\u2019s resignation doesn\u2019t settle the NFL\u2019s larger issues with race,\u201d wrote Peniel E. Joseph. \u201cDespite Black athletic genius producing billions of dollars in revenue for owners, advertisers, television and cable companies, and assorted supply chains, the NFL has been largely, to say the least, retrograde on matters of racial justice,\u201d Joseph said. Banishing Colin Kaepernick for taking a knee to protest \u201cpolice brutality against African Americans exemplified the unequal power relations between the league\u2019s overwhelmingly White owners and the Black players who fill up the box office.\u201d Sending into space Star Trek\u2019s Captain Kirk, in the form of 90-year-old William Shatner, was a bit of a publicity stunt by Jeff Bezos\u2019 space venture Blue Origin, wrote Don Lincoln, a physicist and fan of the show. But the 10-minute flight Wednesday was notable anyway: \u201cShatner is an actor and not an engineer, nor an entrepreneur. He has never contributed directly to space exploration, but he was part of an influential science fiction dynasty that continues to motivate and excite young people to look to the stars and dream,\u201d Lincoln wrote. It\u2019s been 60 years since the trial of Adolf Eichmann, the German official responsible for carrying out \u201cthe systematic rounding up and deportation of millions of Jews and others to their deaths in Nazi concentration camps,\u201d Elie Honig noted. \u201cEichmann\u2019s dry, technical title \u2013 translated roughly as the chief Nazi \u2018logistics coordinator\u2019 \u2013 conveyed his mechanical approach to his work but belied the horror of it all.\u201d The world watched as he sat in a glass booth in a Jerusalem courtroom, after an Israeli manhunt had spirited him out of Argentina to face justice. Eichmann was convicted and executed. Two of the key figures in the trial, both in their mid-90s, were interviewed by Honig: prosecutor Gabriel Bach and investigator Michael Goldmann-Gilead. The investigator told him, \u201cWith the death of Eichmann, the murderous ideology of nationalist socialism was not scattered. It is still existing \u2026 in the form of hatred, hatred that is dangerous. And we must be on guard so that catastrophes do not repeat themselves.\u201d President Joe Biden\u2019s skill as a deal-maker is being put to its biggest test. Can he bring progressives and moderates in the Democrat-controlled Congress together to pass bills on infrastructure and social programs that will cost trillions of dollars? Like his predecessors, Biden is facing the likelihood of big losses in the midterm elections next year \u2013 in addition to the continuing challenge posed by Trump\u2019s election lies. Paul Begala wrote that Democrats have no reasonable choice except to unite. \u201cThe Biden agenda would help lift millions out of poverty. It would help make human life on earth more sustainable by combating carbon pollution.\u201d \u201cIt would make raising children easier, getting an education cheaper, taking life-saving medicine more affordable. It would also boost both the economy and Biden\u2019s anemic approval ratings, the only two things that can stave off an electoral disaster in 2022 and perhaps worse in 2024. Pass the damn bills.\u201d For more: Rachael Scarborough King: For families like mine, the social services in Biden\u2019s budget proposal are a choice between life and death Kara Alaimo: Confronting Kyrsten Sinema in a bathroom was outrageous \u2013 and counterproductive \u201cTexas has long fancied itself the land of the free, a Wild West of wide-open spaces, good BBQ and libertarianism,\u201d wrote Jill Filipovic. \u201cIt\u2019s also the land of shameful hypocrisy.\u201d The state\u2019s governor, Greg Abbott, signed an executive order banning companies from mandating Covid-19 vaccinations, following a pattern set by his earlier bans against mask-wearing and requiring proof of vaccination to enter private businesses. \u201cAll of this is done under the cover of \u2018freedom\u2019 \u2013 freedom, apparently, to sicken and potentially kill your colleagues and neighbors. It\u2019s a kind of freedom from state interference that does not apply to Texas women and girls. After all, this same Texas governor signed a law banning most abortions in the state, with no exception for rape or incest.\u201d The good news is that in most of the US, vaccine mandates are working, and two-thirds of American adults are already fully vaccinated.  CNN\u2019s Dr. Sanjay Gupta went on Joe Rogan\u2019s popular podcast to make the case to skeptics for getting vaccinated. \u201cI guess a small part of me thought I might change Joe Rogan\u2019s mind about vaccines,\u201d wrote Gupta, who said afterward that he \u201crealized it was probably futile. His mind was made up, and there would always be plenty of misinformation out there neatly packaged to support his convictions. Truth is though, I am still glad I did it. My three-hour-long conversation wasn\u2019t just with Rogan. If just a few of his listeners were convinced, it will have been well worth it.\u201d Kyrie Irving, an NBA all-star, was benched by the Brooklyn Nets for refusing the vaccine. In the Washington Post, Eugene Robinson wrote, \u201cI don\u2019t respect his \u2018choice\u2019 at all\u2026we are battling together to defeat a highly infectious virus that has killed more than 720,000 Americans. We have a trio of safe and effective vaccines that slow the spread of the virus and confer miraculous protection against serious illness and death.

Indeed, Craig has \u201cproven himself a far more multidimensional James Bond than we\u2019d ever seen \u2013 acknowledging in his performance the obvious misery and screwed-up detachment of a man who kills for a living, drinks vodka like water and treats women as disposable bait. But in many ways, even with Craig on board, the franchise as it existed up to 2015\u2019s \u2018Spectre\u2019 hadn\u2019t moved that far beyond its tired misogynist roots.\u201d \u201cFemale characters largely came, took their clothes off and went, and Craig\u2019s Bond continued to execute death-defying stunts (as well as countless faceless henchmen) with little concern for life or limb \u2013 including his own.\u201d The new Bond film \u201cNo Time to Die\u201d dispenses with \u201cthe tired, colonial \u2018for Queen and Country\u2019 framing of previous installments.\u201d It treats its women on their own terms, Thomas wrote. \u201cWhereas Bond films traditionally hit refresh on the merry-go-round of featured \u2018girls\u2019 at the beginning of each installment, \u2018No Time To Die\u2019 sees Madeleine Swann \u2013 portrayed with typical depth and beauty by L\u00e9a Seydoux \u2013 make a historic return.

View more opinion at CNN. On November 2, voters across the nation will head to the polls for an array of state and local elections. Although 2021 is considered to be an \u201coff-year election,\u201d there is no shortage of high-profile political positions up for grabs. In addition to New Yorkers deciding who will take over managing America\u2019s largest city, the races for governor in New Jersey and Virginia will likely dominate the election night media coverage. Pundits will be in overdrive, dicing and dissecting exit polls and voting data in search of clues that might give some indication about what this all means for the pivotal 2022 midterm elections, as well as the 2024 presidential race. Yet, there may be one issue looming larger than any one of these high-profile races this November: Question 2 on the Minneapolis ballot, perhaps better known as the referendum on \u201cDefunding the Police.\u201d This controversial ballot measure, sparked by last year\u2019s killing of George Floyd at the hands of former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, asks voters to decide whether to essentially dismantle and defund the city\u2019s current police department, replacing it with a \u201cDepartment of Public Safety\u201d which would exert \u201cpublic safety functions through a comprehensive public health approach to be determined by the Mayor and Council.\u201d The measure, supported by a progressive coalition which has branded itself as \u201cYes on Question 2\u201d explains in \u201cthe majority of situations where people need help, a police officer is not the appropriate response,\u201d and the ballot measure will empower the mayor and city council to \u201cremove a requirement for the city to maintain an armed police-only model of safety.\u201d The City of Minneapolis is a progressive, Democratic stronghold, yet the question will finally bring some clarity to how much mojo the \u201cdefund the police\u201d movement really has against the backdrop of a city where gun violence is careening out of control. For years, long before the death of George Floyd, in many large US cities including Minneapolis, there had been a small, but vocal contingent of racial-justice activists that argued a good chunk of the annual $100 billion in taxpayer dollars used to prop up police departments across the country could be better deployed to reimagine what public safety might look like. These advocates for reform, led by groups such as Black Lives Matter, believe a reapportionment of the funds \u2013 which tend to be the lion\u2019s share of city budgets \u2013 could deliver better net outcomes in urban environments if all or a significant portion of funds were directed towards an array of smart community initiatives, after-school programs for students and public housing efforts. What does Steve Bannon have to hide? Activists have argued police departments are largely failing in their mission to make communities safer by addressing only the symptoms, namely crime, and not its underlying root causes. Some go as far as arguing police departments are really civilian-led paramilitaries that have exacerbated inner-city problems, especially among communities of color, and the time to curtail or even eliminate the role they play in society is long overdue. A poll by PBS\u2019 Frontline with other local news organizations last month suggests Minneapolis voters are split fairly evenly on the issue of defunding the police, with a plurality indicating they would just as soon do away with the MPD. Yet how much of this rhetoric translates into actual yes votes on election day is still very much an open question. The ballot effort has even struggled to gain overwhelming support from the majority of Black voters in Minneapolis, according to the same poll. In the immediate aftermath of George Floyd\u2019s death, I, like so many other Americans of all different racial and ethnic backgrounds, was outraged by the full display of police brutality. In my case, it really hit home as I have two small mixed-race children, and Floyd\u2019s death served as a wake-up call about the need for police reform. However, as a liberal but somewhat moderate Democrat, I see practical and political peril in going too far too quickly to address police abuse. And I am not alone. Politically, the \u2018defund the police\u2019 ballot question debate is driving a wedge between Minnesota Democrats. The state\u2019s best-known progressives, Rep. Ilhan Omar and Attorney General Keith Ellison defend the ballot measure, while other top Democrats, including Sen. Amy Klobuchar and Gov. Tim Walz, strongly oppose it. On a national scale, the Minneapolis ballot question will provide the first test of how much legs the big-city police department restructuring movement really has ahead of the 2022 midterm elections. And for Democrats all along the ideological continuum, the stakes could not be bigger. Europe's energy crunch is giving Putin the upper hand The split between the moderate and progressive wings among Minneapolis Democrats reflects a broader gap evident nationwide, as the Democratic centrist establishment faces increasing pressure from a highly energized and insurgent progressive wing. Should Minneapolis voters decide to vote out their police department and replace it with an ill-defined public safety organization, the result could have national repercussions for Democrats already facing an uphill battle in the 2022 midterms. Republican operatives are already salivating at the thought of shooting TV ads for competitive 2022 House and Senate races that paint Democrats \u2013 even when faced with record crime rates \u2013 as being a party out of touch when it comes to the basic issues of keeping order and maintaining public safety. The national political blowback, should the \u201cyes\u201d option to Question 2 on the Minneapolis ballot prevail, could be significant. Fortunately, this is not lost on some Democrats, especially those in purple swing districts targeted by the National Republican Congressional Committee for takeback. Democratic Rep. Angie Craig, from Minnesota\u2019s 2nd District, which includes suburbs of the Twin Cities, understands even though her district doesn\u2019t include Minneapolis, the political runoff from the defund ballot measure into her own election could be significant. Craig has denounced the police defunding referendum as \u201cshortsighted, misguided and likely to harm the very communities that it seeks to protect.\u201d This much is clear: Although they are extremely vocal, Democrats who support the \u201cdefund the police\u201d movement hold views that are frankly frightening to the majority of Americans across the ideological spectrum. If a progressive stronghold like Minneapolis effectively votes to dismantle its police department, it will send shockwaves across the political ecosystem and deliver Republicans a powerful talking point.  Minneapolis will be seen as a city of lawlessness, and Democrats will be blamed. This is a narrative arc that will feed perfectly into the Republicans\u2019 framing that Democrats just aren\u2019t that good at governing anyway. Need more proof? Republicans will just point to Congress. Despite controlling both the executive and legislative branches of government, Democrats\u2019 internecine dysfunction has already stalled President Joe Biden\u2019s domestic agenda. Coupled with the Biden Administration\u2019s disastrous handling of the military withdrawal from Afghanistan on the foreign policy front, we can see an entire party already bracing for severe voter backlash in 2022. It\u2019s going to be tough enough already for Democrats in 2022. And \u201cQuestion 2\u201d on the Minneapolis ballot could make things a whole lot worse.",

The opinions expressed in this commentary are those of the author. View more opinion articles on CNN. In his first speech at the United Nations General Assembly on Tuesday, President Joe Biden committed America to eschewing a new cold war, pledging instead to lead with its allies in a spirit of unity and resolve to tackle and overcome two of the world\u2019s greatest challenges: climate change and the Covid-19 pandemic. The address was as transformative and expansive as any president has laid out in recent years. If only words could actually walk and get things done. Beneath the high-sounding aspirational rhetoric of the internationalist Biden is, however, lay some harsher truths. Biden\u2019s overriding priority is domestic. And right now, he is an embattled president with dropping approval ratings and a hugely ambitious domestic social and economic agenda hanging in the balance. Abroad, recent actions \u2013 including a chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan conflict, an errant deadly drone strike in Kabul and his French-fried diplomatic row with Emmanuel Macron over the sale of submarines to Australia from which France is now excluded \u2013 have raised questions among allies and adversaries alike about America\u2019s competency, reliability and commitment to play the role Biden outlined in his speech Tuesday. The challenge for the President is now to deliver and to close the widening gap between his words and deeds. If he can\u2019t, American credibility will fall into the gap he himself helped to create. Judging by the applause at the UN following Biden\u2019s speech, his reception might be described as courteous but not overwhelmingly effusive. But it\u2019s a far cry from any of the appearances of his predecessor Donald Trump, who in 2018 was openly mocked by delegates\u2019 laughter \u2013 and not with him. Unlike Trump who viewed the UN as somewhere between irrelevant and hostile, Biden has a long history of supporting the institution, and that was on display again Tuesday. Some analysts have suggested too many of Biden\u2019s foreign policies follow Trump\u2019s. But anyone listening to the President lay out his actions, from rejoining the Paris climate accord to returning to negotiations with Iran to recommitting to the World Health Organization and NATO, could hardly confuse the two. Moreover, Biden\u2019s words regarding leading together \u2013 multilaterally \u2013 and his focus on assisting and supporting poorer countries, human rights and democracies, were the antipode from Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerica first\u201d approach. Indeed, whatever problems US allies have with the Biden Administration, they clearly prefer him over Trump. And American allies and adversaries cannot simply afford to ignore US power and influence. With neither Vladimir Putin or Xi Jinping attending in person and Macron unwilling to speak even virtually, Biden\u2019s address likely dominated the day. As important as Biden\u2019s maiden UN speech may have been to the first year of his presidency, especially in the wake of the recent missteps on Afghanistan and with the French, Biden\u2019s overriding goal is to be a transformative president at home. He would never articulate this publicly, but there is little doubt there is no foreign policy issue in his mind that poses a greater danger to the US and to his presidency than managing Covid-19, expanding the social and economic safety net, growing the economy, maintaining the integrity of voting rights and countering the extreme political and racial polarization in the country nowadays. Clearly, two of those issues \u2013 Covid-19 and climate \u2013 are foreign policy issues too. But his party\u2019s success or failure in keeping control of Congress in 2022 and the results of the 2024 presidential election won\u2019t turn on his ties with France, or even China, in contrast to the bread and butter as well as health issues. Indeed, Biden promised \u201crelentless diplomacy\u201d in the wake of Afghanistan, which represented \u201crelentless war.\u201d But it\u2019s hard to imagine the administration has the political bandwidth or the currency \u2013 let alone opportunities \u2013to deal with conflicts in Syria, Yemen, Libya, Ukraine or Israel and Palestine. Despite his high-sounding commitments to build back a better world at the UN session, for Biden, to paraphrase the late Tip O\u2019Neill, his politics are primarily local. Biden\u2019s dilemma is obvious. To regain and recapture the confidence of allies and adversaries alike and to make good on his high-sounding rhetoric, he needs to deliver. And not on issues that have traditionally defined a foreign policy agenda such as Israeli-Palestinian peace, the ongoing civil war and terrorist threat in Syria or Russian encroachment and influence in Ukraine, but on two of the galactically difficult transnational issues he prioritized in his speech: climate and Covid-19. Granted, he\u2019s wrapped himself in the mantle of multilateralism and partners, thereby realistically sharing the responsibility for addressing them with others. But Covid-19 is the greatest world-altering event since the Second World War, and the international community isn\u2019t rising to the challenge. Climate change represents the gravest planet-altering event now and in the future. And there\u2019s little reason to believe that the UN nor the vaunted international community can do enough to address the challenges. As for Biden, without passage of the climate component of his infrastructure bill \u2013 especially the clean electricity performance program that seeks to promote renewable energy and which is now threatened by West Virginia moderate Sen. Joe Manchin who\u2019s protecting his state\u2019s coal and natural gas interests \u2013 it\u2019s hard to see how the US makes good on its climate commitments. Add to that tensions with China, the world\u2019s largest carbon emitter, which diminish the chances of a US-Chinese accord before the Glasgow climate summit, and the US climate initiative is further handicapped. Biden\u2019s speech at the UN seemed like a blueprint for a world transformed. Sadly, he\u2019ll be lucky if \u2013 in cooperation with allies and partners \u2013 he can find a way to manage some of its myriad challenges and complexities.",

But in staging the recall campaign, Republicans tipped their hand regarding the strategy that they\u2019re presumably prepared to deploy in all future campaigns: Reinforcing the Big Lie narrative that any election won by a Democrat is fraudulent by definition. Despite his preemptive claims of fraud in the weeks before the election, conservative radio host Larry Elder, the leading Republican in the race, told his supporters to \u201cbe gracious in defeat\u201d in the early hours of Wednesday morning, conceding that Newsom had successfully defended his position and saying that he would not contest the results. But in doing so, he added the ominous warning that, \u201cWe may have lost the battle, but we are going to win the war.\u201d Elder became the Republican front-runner more or less by default \u2013 sorry, Caitlyn Jenner \u2013 despite relative obscurity and a chaotic personal life that made him an unlikely standard-bearer for the charge to depose the sitting governor. His ex-fiancee publicly alleged that he\u2019d waved a handgun at her while he was high on marijuana, prompting other Republican candidates to demand that he withdraw from the race. (Elder denied these claims saying he \u201cnever brandished a gun at anyone.\u201d) Furthermore, his views were extreme even for a conservative: His racial perspectives have led Black activists to call him \u201cthe Black face of White supremacy,\u201d and he\u2019s spoken of wanting to set the minimum wage at zero (though he has paradoxically also said he has \u201cno intention of getting rid of the minimum wage\u201d), abolish Medicare and use his power to ban abortion, according to tweets from prominent anti-abortion activist Lila Rose, while vowing to roll back state-level protective mandates on Covid-19 \u2013 all positions that most voters in deep blue California would find horrifying. Newsom calls out Trump in speech after defeating recall effort But the conservative ecosystem that backed Elder\u2019s run didn\u2019t seem to be simply looking for him to win, even though the uniquely arcane mechanisms of California\u2019s recall politics made it briefly seem as if that might be possible. The true goal of Elder\u2019s Republican backers appeared to be for him to at least lose by a margin that would allow them to contest the results in order to claim that Democrats had once again engaged in magical manipulation of ballots, voting machines or the brains of voters themselves, thus making the election seem null and void and expanding already widespread doubt and paranoia about the nature of our democracy. How do we know this? Because Elder told us. Elder recently proclaimed on Fox News his belief that the elections would be rife with fraud, repeating a far-right talking point that emerged in the aftermath of the 2020 presidential election. \u201cThe 2020 election, in my opinion, was full of shenanigans. And my fear is they\u2019re going to try that in this election right here.\u201d Trump himself followed up with a concurring statement: \u201cDoes anybody really believe the California Recall Election isn\u2019t rigged?\u201d he wrote in a statement sent via his Save America PAC. \u201cMillions and millions of Mail-In Ballots will make this just another giant Election Scam, no different, but less blatant, than the 2020 Presidential Election Scam!\u201d Elder\u2019s campaign went as far as to push a request to voters to report fraud through a portal on his campaign website. \u201cStatistical analyses used to detect fraud in elections held in 3rd-world nations (such as Russia, Venezuela, and Iran) have detected fraud in California resulting in Governor Gavin Newsom being reinstated as governor,\u201d read the linked page titled \u201cFight California Election Fraud!\u201d \u201cThe primary analytical tool used was Benford\u2019s Law and can be readily reproduced.\u201d But that message was pushed out on Monday, the day before the election \u2013 that is, before there were any results to analyze. The incompetence of Elder\u2019s campaign team, and the overwhelming, indisputable outcome of the recall vote itself, with far more \u201cNo\u201d votes than \u201cYeses,\u201d thwarted this latest attempt by Republicans to metastasize the Big Lie. Perhaps if the timing screw up on the election fraud claims hadn\u2019t occurred \u2013 or if the recall vote had been closer \u2013 we\u2019d see a California repeat of the nightmarish carnival of Republicans pushing to audit the 2020 presidential election in an array of states. As Gov. Newsom\u2019s top strategist Sean Clegg told CNN\u2019s Dan Merica, \u201cWe saw it in the November election. We saw it in the January 6 insurrection \u2026 They\u2019re trying to throw battery acid on our Constitution, on our electoral norms. And it\u2019s a preview of coming attractions. We\u2019re going to see the same thing in 2022 and the same thing in 2024.\u201d Republicans are no longer running against Democrats. They\u2019re running against democracy.  To be sure, our democracy isn\u2019t perfect, but the real problems it faces are not fraud, but phenomena like denial of poll access, racist gerrymandering and the overwhelming shadow influence of dark money. All of which are being eclipsed by these persistent false allegations of manipulation, rigging and hacking, despite the fact that no fraud has credibly been found in any of the audits and recounts that have taken place in our modern era. The Big Lie didn\u2019t overturn the result of the 2020 election, and it didn\u2019t work to get Newsom out of office. But it does consistently rally the conservative base and raise huge amounts of money, encouraging Republicans to keep spreading it. We can only hope it won\u2019t work next time either.",

The views expressed in this commentary are those of the author. View more opinion on CNN. With the relentless wave of voter suppression bills crashing over America, it is deeply disturbing that voting rights are still not regarded by some as a foundational pillar of our nation\u2019s infrastructure. Especially now, as our democracy\u2019s infrastructure is crumbling. President Joe Biden calls the sweeping bipartisan infrastructure package under consideration by Congress a signal to the world that \u201cour democracy can function, deliver, and do big things.\u201d However, for our democracy to function, it requires not only the building of roads, bridges and railways, but also the guarantee of access and participation in our political process. A proper democracy vests its power in its nation\u2019s people and their elected representatives. But the current fractured state of our democracy prevents many citizens from exercising their constitutional rights and making their voices heard. Just this year, state legislators around the country have introduced more than 400 bills that will make it more difficult for Americans to vote, and 18 states have enacted 30 new laws doing precisely that, according to the Brennan Center for Justice. Whereas the current infrastructure deal promises significant long-term investments in our country\u2019s transportation and renewable energy, the assurance of a healthy, fully participatory democracy remains elusive. We must broaden the conversation on what is considered infrastructure. This should be the only priority for Democrats We cannot limit ourselves to seeking improvements to our roads, bridges and public transit. Although our languishing transportation and public works system certainly require repair and modernization \u2013 and racial equity must be a centerpiece of that \u2013 it would be a huge mistake to ignore the perilous state of our democracy. The array of federal investments under consideration will not have the grand impact intended on our economy and our social structures if too many of our citizens are still excluded from participating in decision-making on these and other vital issues of the day. We urge the White House and Congress to reconstruct our deteriorating voting infrastructure and counter the almost daily assaults on our democracy which we are witnessing around the country. Empowering partisan poll watchers, restricting mail-in ballots, and reducing early voting impose additional barriers on citizens who are already severely hampered in exercising their right to vote. Unfortunately, for too much of the country, the trend keeps moving in the wrong direction. Let\u2019s be clear. Restricting access to voting is an existential threat to our democracy. Biden recently called today\u2019s voter suppression efforts a \u201c21st century Jim Crow assault\u201d that is \u201creal. It\u2019s relenting.\u201d He is right: \u201cThe denial of full and free and fair elections is the most un-American thing that any of us can imagine.\u201d Beto O'Rourke: Texas offers Americans a stark history lesson Fifty six years ago this Friday, August 6, former President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Voting Rights Act, banning vicious measures and schemes that excluded Black Americans from participating in our democracy. That law \u2013 widely considered the most consequential civil rights law ever enacted \u2013 had strong bipartisan support. In fact, 30 Republican senators voted for its passage. The Voting Rights Act continued to have bipartisan support through its four reauthorizations, signed into law each time by a Republican president. Tragically, the Supreme Court has eviscerated enforcement of this law, gutting the heart of the act eight years ago and substantially weakening another key provision just this term. That strong support from both sides of the aisle for the act must continue today. It is simply unfathomable that voting discrimination outlawed by Congress over half a century ago is allowed to run rampant in its modern-day form today \u2013 and in a country that holds itself out to the world as the beacon for democracy. Additionally, it is of the utmost priority that the US Senate and the US House of Representatives act immediately to rebuild and expand our election infrastructure so that everyone eligible is able to participate and have their voice heard. Congress should move forward with legislation to do precisely that.  Preventing discrimination in voting and ensuring equal access to the ballot box should be a cornerstone of our democracy, not a constant struggle. As we\u2019ve seen in Maine, Vermont and Kentucky, it is possible to pass bills that advance voting rights. Whether it is Kentucky expanding early voting and in-person voting options or Vermont ensuring every registered voter automatically receives an absentee ballot for statewide general elections, the pathway to more expansive voting measures on behalf of the American people is possible and within reach. In signing the Voting Rights Act of 1965, Johnson recognized its significance not only for Black people, but for all Americans. At the time, he said, \u201cIt is also a victory for the freedom of the American Nation. And every family across this great, entire, searching land will live stronger in liberty, will live more splendid in expectation, and will be prouder to be American because of the act \u2026 that I will sign today.\u201d Our leaders today must recognize the value of voting rights for all as foundational to the success of our nation. In the spirit of the strong bipartisanship that has enveloped the Voting Rights Act throughout history, we call upon these leaders to seize this moment of exceptional urgency and act in unison to ensure all Americans have a voice in our future by strengthening the infrastructure of our democracy.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Beto O\u2019Rourke is an El Paso native, the former US Congressman for the community and a former Democratic candidate for President of the United States. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion on CNN. There have been three critical moments where Texas has proved decisive for democracy and voting rights in this country. The first two, in 1890 and 1965, afford us key insights into how we can make the most of the third one \u2013 taking place right now. After Reconstruction, states throughout the South were rife with White supremacist terrorism, racial injustice and attacks on Black voting rights \u2014 and by the late 19th century, Texas was among the most brutal. Whites-only Democratic clubs and their armed militias had \u201cpurified\u201d the ballot box in one Texas county after another. Political violence, assassinations and lynchings enforced White rule throughout much of the state at the expense of Black lives and Black voting rights. In the Washington County election of 1886, for example, ballot boxes in Black precincts were stolen at gunpoint by agents of a Whites-only political ring known as the \u201cPeople\u2019s Party.\u201d When Black poll workers dared to fight back at one of the precincts, they were arrested, and three of them \u2014 Shad Felder, Alfred Jones and Stewart Jones \u2014 were lynched by a mob. No one was ever brought to justice. The national outrage this produced compelled Congress to hold hearings on the troubled voting practices that plagued Texas and much of the South. The resulting Federal Elections Bill of 1890 promised greater federal intervention to protect the right to vote in any state where it was threatened. Like the Democratic Party today, the Republican Party of 1890 had recently won majorities in the US House and Senate, and, with the election of Benjamin Harrison in 1888, controlled the presidency, too. And like today\u2019s Democratic Party, those Republicans publicly resolved to use that power to secure voting rights, especially for the Black targets of voter suppression efforts in the South. The Federal Elections Bill duly passed the House of Representatives that year and debate on its passage soon began in the Senate. But unfortunately for that bill and for millions of Black Americans, the Senate Republicans were unable \u2014 or perhaps unwilling \u2014 to overcome a filibuster threat led by the Democrats. It didn\u2019t help that Harrison, who had campaigned on a platform of restoring voting rights, remained on the sidelines for much of the action. So, after all the righteous indignation over the election outrage in Texas had been spent, the majority party meekly gave up the fight for voting rights. They blinked in the face of the filibuster and denied America the chance to establish a true multiracial democracy. What the GOP is really after in Texas In the aftermath, state legislatures throughout the former Confederacy imposed Whites-only primary laws and additional forms of Jim Crow voter suppression, including poll taxes, literacy tests and extraordinary residency requirements (all of which Whites could bypass thanks to the \u201cgrandfather clause\u201d that exempted those whose grandfathers had been registered voters). It took 75 years, a relentless voting rights movement and the first president from Texas to provide another opportunity to reestablish the right to vote in the South. Soon after Congress passed the Civil Rights Act of 1964, civil rights leaders like Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. pressed President Lyndon B. Johnson to work on an accompanying voting rights bill. After Johnson told activists that he just didn\u2019t have the power to move Congress, King resolved to \u201cget the President some power.\u201d Over the following months, civil and voting rights leaders brought the issue to the forefront of the national conversation. Through protests and marches, direct action and extraordinary courage, they successfully engaged the conscience of the country. And when John Lewis was beaten within an inch of his life leading a march from Selma to Montgomery on March 7, 1965, Johnson finally had the power he needed. Just eight days after Bloody Sunday, the President convened a joint session of Congress and told the assembled members that no other issue was as important as securing the country\u2019s democracy. \u201cShould we defeat every enemy, should we double our wealth and conquer the stars, and still be unequal to this issue,\u201d he said, \u201cthen we will have failed as a people and as a nation.\u201d As far as Johnson was concerned, no short-term political interest would compromise the intensity of this fight for the most important of American rights. By using the full power of the presidency, he helped move Congress to pass the Voting Rights Act on August 5, 1965 and signed it into law the next day. Toobin: Voting Rights Act close to being irrelevant As long as the law stood, states would be forced to tear down barriers to the ballot box and guarantee equal voting access to every eligible American. But it turned out that the law could not stand forever. When the US Supreme Court stripped critical protections from the Voting Rights Act in its 2013 Shelby County v. Holder decision, Southern legislatures responded in much the same way that they did following the end of Reconstruction and the defeat of the Elections Bill of 1890: they moved to dramatically restrict the ability to vote. This time, voter suppression would come in the form of new voter ID laws, polling place closures and racially gerrymandered districts designed to reduce the voting power of Black and minority voters, the poor, the very young and the very old. This anti-democratic movement aggressively metastasized following former President Donald Trump\u2019s Big Lie about widespread election fraud in the 2020 election. In just the first six months of this year, more than a dozen states enacted new laws to make it easier to restrict access to the ballot box. In Texas, the Republican-led legislature\u2019s voter suppression bill was bad enough for Democratic lawmakers to leave the state for Washington, D.C. in an effort to block its passage and plead for federal action in the form of the For the People Act. Texas state rep: Why I flew to the nation's capital Much like the Federal Elections Bill of 1890, the For the People Act\u2019s provisions are commensurate with the scope of the current threat to American democracy. The bill would ensure equal access to early voting and mail-in voting, establish automatic voter registration, make election day a national holiday and end gerrymandering (redistricting used to \u201cdraw\u201d people of color out of voting power in states like Texas). In March, the House passed the For the People Act on a party-line vote, just like with the 1890 elections bill. But the For the People Act has been stopped by the threat of a filibuster in the Senate, in a manner quite similar to the 1890 elections bill. Though Democrats have the power to overcome this procedural vestige of segregation, they have been paralyzed by intra-party disagreements and an unwillingness to take seriously the challenges faced by Black and brown voters. Their inaction risks dooming the bill to failure. That defeat doesn\u2019t have to be America\u2019s fate. Just as civil rights leaders and everyday Americans successfully pushed Johnson to use the power of his office to pass voting rights, we can do the same to push President Joe Biden to make voting rights his number one priority \u2013 and to place all of his political capital into urging the Senate to carve out an exception to the filibuster. (Exceptions already exist for federal judges, Supreme Court justices, budget deals and fast-track trade agreements.) Those Texas Democratic legislators who took the fight to the nation\u2019s capital are pushing the President to do just that. Their quorum break, which will end on August 6, exactly 56 years after the signing of the Voting Rights Act of 1965, has bought us some time to save free and fair elections before it\u2019s too late.  The question is, what will the President do with it? Biden is certainly no Harrison, who campaigned for office on a platform of voting rights but then allowed the matter to languish once in office. In fact, Biden gave an extraordinarily powerful speech in Philadelphia earlier this month, describing in the starkest of terms the existential threat our democracy faces. If he follows that up by using the tremendous power of his office to help change the rules of the filibuster to save our democracy, he will stand alongside Johnson as a champion and savior of American democracy. But he must take to heart the lessons of Texas: when we fight for the right to vote, we can expand democracy to include everyone. But when we give up without a fight, we can lose democracy itself.",

David Rosenberg College of Law who specializes in election law, voting rights, and constitutional law. He is the author of \u201cVote for US: How to Take Back Our Elections and Change the Future of Voting.\u201d Follow him @JoshuaADouglas. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own; view more opinion at CNN. Eight years ago, the US Supreme Court gutted a major portion of the Voting Rights Act in its infamous Shelby County v. Holder decision, making it easier for states with a history of voter discrimination to enact new onerous voting rules. States like Georgia and Texas took notice, passing strict new voter ID laws, absentee ballot rules and a host of other provisions that make it harder for some people to vote. The Court just doubled down on that attack on the right to vote. The specific Arizona laws at issue in the Brnovich case, which the Court just decided by a 6-3 vote that fell on predictable ideological lines, are less momentous than the rule the Court laid down for future Voting Rights Act cases. Still, while upholding the Arizona laws, the Court made it much harder for voting rights advocates to protect against racial discrimination. Voting rights plaintiffs had filed suit against two Arizona laws: one says that a vote will not count if a voter goes to the wrong precinct and then, finding their name not in the poll books, fills out a provisional ballot. The other limits who can collect and return completed ballots, also known to opponents as ballot harvesting. The plaintiffs argued that the laws violated Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act, which prohibits voting rules that have the effect of making it harder for minority voters to cast a ballot that will count. As expected, the Court upheld both laws, reversing the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals. The question wasn\u2019t whether the voting rights advocates would lose this case; it was how badly they would lose. They lost the whole ballgame. To be sure, the Court did not completely gut Section 2 of the Voting Rights Act. Instead, the majority opinion, delivered by Justice Samuel Alito, is more subtle, offering five \u201cguideposts\u201d to construe the landmark civil rights statute. But each of those guideposts place significant hurdles on voting rights plaintiffs going forward \u2013 spelling bad news for equality in the right to vote. In Georgia, will courts leave the fox in charge of the hen house? Put simply, it\u2019s death by a thousand cuts. Alito said that, in analyzing whether a law results in vote denial on the basis of race, courts should consider (1) the overall burden on voters, (2) whether the voting rule has been around for a long time, (3) the size of the impact on minority voters, (4) the state\u2019s overall election scheme, and (5) the state\u2019s interest in combating election fraud. None of this is within the text of the Voting Rights Act. Section 2 simply says that a law is invalid if voting is \u201cnot equally open\u201d to racial minorities and if it provides \u201cless opportunity than other members of the electorate to participate in the political process.\u201d As Justice Elena Kagan wrote in her powerful dissent, the majority \u201cfounds its decision on a list of mostly made-up factors, at odds with Section 2 itself.\u201d For instance, whether a state has an interest in combating voter fraud \u2013 miniscule as it is \u2013 should have little bearing on the question of whether a law discriminates among voters. Whether some states have used the same rule for years should also be irrelevant under the law. A law that currently produces a discriminatory effect harms voters in every election. Alito\u2019s opinion may also impact claims that a legislature passed a law with a discriminatory intent, which is the issue raised by Attorney General Merrick Garland\u2019s lawsuit, filed last week, against Georgia\u2019s new onerous voting law. Alito indicated that \u201cpartisan motives are not the same as racial motives,\u201d meaning that a court could potentially reject the argument that race was Georgia\u2019s key motivation by focusing on the politics of the debate in the state legislature.  There is no easy solution to this conundrum. Congress was considering the For the People Act, which would require easy voting access across the country, but even though it passed the US House of Representatives, it stalled at the US Senate. Congress is also still considering the John Lewis Voting Rights Act, but it is unclear if the bill has enough votes. State courts are still open to claims that voting laws violate state constitutions. And even after the Court\u2019s decision, Section 2 is still available to ferret out the worst voting laws, though the standard is now a lot tougher to meet. The Court\u2019s decision is a stark reminder that it is no fan of voting rights. The thumb is firmly on the side of the states to regulate their elections as they wish, which in many places is bad news for American democracy.",

View more opinion articles on CNN. The man best known for popularizing the term \u201cBlack power\u201d always answered the phone with the words, \u201cready for revolution.\u201d Stokely Carmichael answered the phone this way to acknowledge his role in sacred efforts to build a new society in America and around the world. He defined revolution as transforming the status quo relationship between world systems and societies, institutions and citizens. Carmichael, who replaced John Lewis as head of the Student Non-Violent Coordinating Committee in 1966, led the largest anti-war demonstration of the 1960s and marched alongside of Martin Luther King Jr. He died of cancer at 57 in 1998 but would have turned 80 on June 29; his legacy casts an enormous shadow (no less than Malcolm X and Martin Luther King Jr.) over 21st century Black politics. This milestone birthday of Carmichael\u2019s is a moment to observe how today\u2019s Black politics still bears the imprint of an icon who remains underappreciated and misunderstood to this day. For many, Carmichael will always remain the 24-year-old firebrand who sparked a global political revolution by shouting \u201cBlack power!\u201d to exhort a crowd while marching down Mississippi\u2019s Highway 51 arm in arm with Dr. Martin Luther King in the late spring humidity of June 1966.  Carmichael had been jailed with future Congressman John Lewis, parried verbally with writer James Baldwin in 1963 as a student at Howard University when Baldwin was invited to campus, listened to Malcolm X speak as a college freshman and served as a bodyguard and driver for King, whom he considered a beloved friend and mentor, in the Mississippi Delta. \u201cIn order for America to really live on a basic principle of human relationships, a new society must be born,\u201d observed Carmichael during a 1966 speech at the University of California at Berkeley. \u201cRacism must die,\u201d he continued. \u201cThe economic exploitation of this country of non-white peoples around the world must also die \u2013 must also die.\u201d The parts of Carmichael\u2019s activism that focused on economic justice \u2013 he became a socialist during the second half of his life \u2013 remain more important now than ever. Carmichael\u2019s legacy spans the movement for Black power, the push for voting rights in the 21st century and the recent political campaigns that have given voice to those seeking more radical change \u2013  including socialists, community organizers and Black Lives Matter activists. There would be no Black Lives Matter movement without Carmichael\u2019s political activism, which spanned the sit-in movement, the freedom rides, Mississippi freedom summer, Selma and beyond. The movement for Black lives owes much of its radical political edge to Carmichael\u2019s organizing, activism and political and cultural rhetoric. He argued that Black lives mattered against the backdrop of the Vietnam War, White backlash and urban rebellions against police violence, structural poverty and systemic racism in the late 1960s. His 1967 book \u201cBlack Power,\u201d co-authored with scholar Charles Hamilton, introduced the term \u201cinstitutional racism\u201d into the nation\u2019s vocabulary. Carmichael\u2019s activism inspired the Black Panthers (a group he briefly joined as honorary prime minister in 1968), galvanized Black students and ignited a cultural revolution that spanned the world, attracting a rainbow coalition of Black and indigenous activists across the globe. The election of Black activists to high public office in our own time \u2013 from Rep. Cori Bush in Missouri to Rep. Lucy McBath in Georgia \u2013 marks a 21st-century translation of this kind of organizing energy into political power. The protests following the murder of George Floyd have made \u201cinstitutional racism\u201d a part of America\u2019s social lexicon in ways that Carmichael may never even have imagined. Rep. Bush on qualified immunity: 'We compromise, we die' But the current environment of backlash against anti-racist efforts would surely not have surprised him. In his own era, Carmichael combated FBI surveillance, police violence against civil rights demonstrators and racial terror from the Mississippi Delta and the Alabama Black Belt to the gritty urban streets of Harlem, Oakland and Los Angeles. Over time he came to define the obstacles against Black citizenship as global in scope and systemic in nature, which pushed him to embrace a brand of socialism that found hope for eradicating racism and economic injustice in a society that privileged Black and poor people over profits and invested in systems of justice rather than punishment. Carmichael\u2019s efforts to forge what he called \u201ca new society\u201d free of White supremacy and systemic racism is flowering in new ways in the age of Black Lives Matter. We can see it especially in the election of progressive Black candidates such as India Walton, the first Black woman to be elected mayor of Buffalo. Walton, a 38-year-old community organizer and nurse is a self-described socialist whose victory reflects the fact that another world is possible.  Portions of Carmichael\u2019s critique of capitalism and racism can be found in her call to reimagine public safety, invest resources in ending poverty instead of punishment, and utilizing local elections in the service of community empowerment. After his Black power heyday, Carmichael relocated in 1969 to Conakry, Guinea, and changed his name to Kwame Ture in honor of his political mentors (former Ghanaian prime minister Kwame Nkrumah and Guniean President Sekou Toure). For the rest of his life he advocated a form of African socialism rooted in global Black solidarity and defined Black power as an internationally based movement against imperialism, racism and capitalism. He organized the All African People\u2019s Revolutionary Party in hopes of forging a global movement against the triple evils of militarism, racism and materialism that Dr. King also outlined near the end of his own life. The right is panicking over critical race theory Ture would not be surprised by America\u2019s latest cultural wars: assaults against \u201ccritical race theory,\u201d a rhetorical sleight of hand designed to halt efforts at teaching about racial slavery, Jim Crow, Tulsa \u2013 in other words, the full depth and breadth of American history. Before the phrase \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d convulsed the nation, \u201cBlack power\u201d produced a similar effect, leading to a national movement for Black Studies programs, expanding Negro History Week into Black History Month, and producing new intellectual, literary and popular depictions of Black American History that continue to reverberate in our own time. He continued to answer the phone \u201cready for revolution\u201d even during the lean political years of the 1980s, a decade that represented a reversal of course from the hopeful optimism that guided much of the ambitious Great Society agenda of the 1960s. Ronald Reagan\u2019s presidency successfully reinterpreted the 1960s as a time of liberal political excess and racial overreach, making the freedom dreams of Ture seem anachronistic against the \u201cgreed is good\u201d ethos of the period.  Amid that Reagan Revolution a young college student named Barack Obama sat in a Columbia University audience during the early 1980s as Ture talked of organizing a political revolution against racial and economic oppression that seemed as distant as the moon. \u201cHis eyes glowed inward,\u201d Obama wrote in his memoir, \u201cDreams from My Father,\u201d \u2013 \u201cthe eyes of a madman or a saint.\u201d The young Carmichael\u2019s call for Black power in 1966 proved remarkably prescient and enduring, evolving from an anti-racist call to resistance into an effort to organize a socialist revolution that could eradicate racism, economic injustice and other forms of oppression. In our own time both aspects of his legacy appear to be flourishing, with efforts to achieve Black liberation through political self-determination and systemic change that would have made the young Stokely Carmichael proud and made Kwame Ture smile.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Julian Zelizer, a CNN political analyst, is a professor of history and public affairs at Princeton University and author of the book, \u201cBurning Down the House: Newt Gingrich, the Fall of a Speaker, and the Rise of the New Republican Party.\u201d Follow him on Twitter @julianzelizer. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion at CNN. Democrats are feeling the lure of \u201claw and order.\u201d President Joe Biden is set to deliver remarks Wednesday outlining his plan to reduce violent crime. And in New York City, Brooklyn Borough President Eric Adams, a retired police officer, is leading in the Democratic primary. One of Adams\u2019 main issues was promising to take a tough stand against crime. In other parts of the country, more Democrats have been backing away from anything that even sounds like \u201cdefund the police.\u201d The political appeal of touting \u201claw and order\u201d is clear. The rise in homicide rates, particularly in large cities, has become for many a serious new worry. At the most basic level, all Americans want to live in neighborhoods that are free from crime and danger. They want their children to be able to walk the streets without fearing harm. They want to be able to leave their homes without worrying that someone might try to steal their property. They want communities and schools that are peaceful and where violence is not normalized. A number of polls show, though, that when asked about the most important challenges facing the nation, most Americans don\u2019t put crime high on the list, as they do jobs and the economy. But when specifically questioned about their views on guns and violent crime, their concern is significant. In an April Pew Research Center poll, 48% said they considered violent crime a big problem, and 36% a moderately big problem. Gallup reports that majorities perceive crime as rising (78% in November), although only 38% thought that was true where they lived. For Democrats, concern about such metrics in the approach to a midterm election could easily turn them away from important civil rights issues related to criminal justice. There have been other periods when Democrats have taken a hard shift toward \u201claw and order\u201d \u2013 in which safety equates with tougher policing and more draconian sentencing \u2013 based on the belief that this was the only way to ward off Republicans attacking them as \u201csoft\u201d on these issues. Former police chief: Our profession is in crisis In 1968, as the historian Elizabeth Hinton showed in her pathbreaking book, \u201cFrom the War on Poverty to the War on Crime,\u201d President Lyndon Johnson responded to the urban rebellions of 1967 by ramping up the federal war on crime with the Omnibus Crime Control and Safe Streets Act of 1968, allocating about $400 million for law enforcement and setting the stage for President Richard Nixon and other Republicans to bind themselves to the issue for decades to come. During the 1990s, many Democrats were on board with this agenda. This was the context in which then Sen. Biden helped pass the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act of 1994, which played a role in the mass incarceration of African Americans. To be sure, most Democrats that have leaned into the issue also acknowledged the need to focus on community programs, gun control and civil rights as well. As Bill Clinton said in his 1992 campaign, \u201cFour years ago this crime issue was used to divide America. I want to use it to unite America. I want to be tough on crime and good for civil rights. You can\u2019t have civil justice without order and safety.\u201d But the policies, such as the 1994 crime bill, have tended to come down stronger on entrenching and expanding existing criminal justice institutions. While most Republicans hardened their stance on law and order during the Trump era, a significant number of Democrats seemed to have opened their eyes to the ways in which the institutions of criminal justice perpetuated racial inequality. Horrendous smartphone and bodycam videos have shown how violent police have too often become in confrontations with African Americans over very small infractions. Policing methods adopted since the 1980s, such as stop-and-frisk, increased the odds that Americans of color would find themselves in direct standoffs with police officers. Brazen thefts on the rise in San Francisco Social scientists have documented how law enforcement often focused attention on low-income areas and communities of color. And changes in sentencing for minor transgressions, such as the sale of marijuana, resulted in a disproportionate number of brown and Black Americans finding themselves trapped in the booming prison system. The First Step Act, which passed with bipartisan support in 2018 and was signed by then President Donald Trump, was an important, albeit limited, step forward in reform. But, as a new book by The Wall Street Journal reporter Michael Bender argues, Trump worried that the empathy he felt upon seeing the video of George Floyd\u2019s murder would be seen as a sign of political weakness. Much of his final year focused on a replay of Richard Nixon\u2019s tough-on-crime rhetoric. In 2021, the Democratic Party would do well to move forward with caution. As John Pfaff wrote in The New Republic, the data about the recent crime increases is complicated. For example, he notes, the rise in violent crime (and in many places where this is being discussed the levels have not actually risen much), has taken place in areas that have not really reformed their systems. That is, the old system often doesn\u2019t need to be restored, it\u2019s still there and it\u2019s not working. If many Democrats walk away from the pervasive problems that have moved to the center of the national debate, they will be making a grave mistake and will set back civil rights for at least a generation, just as occurred after the 1960s. In the end, the nation must realize that true \u201claw and order\u201d depends on racial justice. Presenting these two goals as a binary misses the point. A genuine system to achieve safety in our cities and suburbs depends on redistributing government money to relieve the police of many obligations they are not suited to handle \u2013 such as police calls to deal with mentally ill subjects appearing to put themselves or others in danger \u2013 and leading to fraught encounters. It means funding services that will help ameliorate social problems that often fuel crime, as well as limiting access to the guns being used on the streets. Law and order means achieving accountability in police departments so that civilians of all colors can trust the police they see on the street to be there to protect and work with them rather than threaten them. Otherwise, policing will never be effective, as the Kerner Commission pointed out back in 1968. The party might also note that 54% of those polled by Quinnipiac supported stricter gun control and, according to ABC News, 50% prioritized reducing gun violence over laws that guarantee their right to guns.  And they might consider as well that, significantly, Gallup found in May that only 2% polled thought crime or violence was the nation\u2019s most important issue. The nation is at another crossroads on racial justice. While Biden is directing attention toward crime, initial reports about his proposals suggest he is seeking to carve out a new path. He wants to slow the spread of firearms, put money into evidence-based community violence interventions and increase the number of summer programs and services available to younger Americans. If the President can keep the discussion centered on these sorts of solutions, he might offer a way for Democrats to respond to public concerns without going down a Nixonian route.  Once the debate accelerates, more Democrats might be seduced into a \u201ctougher\u201d kind of stance. But if Democrats move away from reform based on political expediency, neither party will be prepared to give support to the changes that are urgently needed to eliminate the institutional racism that remains pervasive in our criminal justice system. Despite what some Democrats are now saying, and what most Republican leaders have already been repeating on a regular basis, true safety depends on a socially just system.",

Tuesday\u2019s party-line vote in the US Senate to kill debate on the For the People Act certified the modern Republican Party as officially anti-voting rights. Because many Republicans do not believe they can win national elections when every eligible American votes, they are no longer willing to protect the franchise for all citizens. Any Democratic senator who hopes for a future of bipartisan cooperation must act now to use the party\u2019s slim majority to protect voting rights and save our democracy from a death spiral. This year began with an assault on the US Capitol, carried out by people seeking to violently overturn the outcome of the 2020 election because their candidate \u2013 former President Donald Trump \u2013 lost. Fortunately, their efforts failed. Joe Manchin plays monkey wrench to Democrats' plans But now GOP-controlled state legislatures across the country have begun taking steps to curtail voting rights, many of which will adversely impact voters of color. According to the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University, as of May this year, legislators in 48 states have introduced 389 bills with restrictive voting provisions \u2013 placing new limits on absentee ballots, early voting days, and ballot drop-off boxes, among others. In short, the anti-democracy haze that hung over the Capitol on January 6 clouds our state legislatures. But we cannot allow it to cloud our vision or dilute our principled commitment to a free and fair American democracy. Politics may be the art of compromise, but leadership is always about knowing what is non-negotiable. Because people in high office are distanced from the harsh realities everyday people face, it can be easy for political leaders to lose perspective. The job of civil rights movements is to make clear what cannot be negotiated on the backs of everyday people. As people who\u2019ve committed our whole lives to movements for justice and a multiracial democracy, we know that immediate federal protection against current assaults on voting rights is non-negotiable. In the name of compromise, Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia recently suggested that the US Senate could pass scaled-back versions of the For the People Act and the John Lewis Voting Rights Act. Even so, he could not find a single Republican colleague to support his proposal. Instead, Republicans circled their wagons to use the filibuster Manchin has defended as a mechanism to block progress. Why Stacey Abrams is open to Joe Manchin's voting rights proposal While many have noted how Manchin\u2019s efforts expose Republican recalcitrance, we must also note how the details of his proposal revealed how dangerous compromise is when it comes to fundamental constitutional rights. For example, Manchin\u2019s proposal would have required some form of voter ID nationwide, expanding to all states a suppression measure that proliferated after the election of our first Black president. His proposal also did not address several reforms included in pending legislation to guard against discrimination in our voting system and modernize our elections. One centerpiece expansion omitted in Manchin\u2019s proposal was the federal re-enfranchisement of formerly incarcerated people, a cornerstone equality provision of the For the People Act and a moral touchstone of democratic inclusion. Indeed, it appears that several of his modifications to the democracy protection voting bills could have had negative impact, particularly on African Americans and other people of color. Capitulation to those who are willing to abandon democratic elections as long as it keeps them in power is an insult to the legacy of the late Rep. John Lewis. His blood was spilled on the Edmund Pettus Bridge to help people see the need for the Voting Rights Act in 1965. Now, more than half a century later, Manchin suggests this Congress should use his name to pass a version of the VRA with weaker pre-clearance standards that are, in fact, a step backward. Lewis fought his whole political career against the political forces that tried to counter the gains of the civil rights movement. He was a primary shaper of the voting rights and democracy protections that have been consolidated in the For the People Act, and he fought for every one of those provisions because he knew \u2013 even before the newest surge of assaults on the foundations of our democracy \u2013 they were needed to protect our democracy.  We make a mistake when we reduce our history to sound bites or allow others to define the long civil rights movement that ushered in America\u2019s Second Reconstruction as solely about the fundamental fight for Black people\u2019s right to equal protection under the law. The struggle for voting rights and equal citizenship has never been a fight for the rights of Black people alone. The same people who don\u2019t want Black people to vote also don\u2019t want women, young people, poor and low-income people and other non-White people to vote. They stay in power by targeting those who would vote against them, weakening our country by promoting racial and ethnic division \u2013 and then use their legislative power in state and federal legislatures to block living wages, healthcare and infrastructure investments that have the support of a majority of Americans. By compromising with their tactics, our political leaders forfeit their basic duty to serve the good of the whole. This is a moment when We the People must draw a line in the sand. The right of every citizen over 18 years of age to participate in America\u2019s democracy is non-negotiable. Democrats who may be inclined to rally behind a \u201ccompromise\u201d should remember the bedrocks of the US Constitution they have sworn to uphold. They must rise to meet the moral crises of our time, forgo the filibuster and pass generationally significant protections to rescue the promise of democracy.",

View more opinion on CNN. This week Democrats will try to advance a sweeping new voting rights bill in the US Senate. The legislation, which passed the US House of Representatives in March, would enact automatic voter registration, expand early voting, modernize our antiquated voting systems, and restore the voting rights of Americans with prior felony convictions. The bill, known as the For the People Act, is sure to fail without the necessary 50th vote from conservative Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin of West Virginia. Last week, Manchin introduced a scaled-down version that would still include provisions to make Election Day a holiday, ban gerrymandering, and require at least 15 consecutive days of early voting. But Manchin\u2019s compromise added what some pundits considered a poison pill \u2013 demanding some form of voter identification. Then came Stacey Abrams. The rising Democratic star and progressive favorite ran for governor of Georgia in 2018, delivered the party\u2019s response to former President Donald Trump\u2019s State of the Union address in 2019, and emerged as a potential vice presidential candidate for Joe Biden\u2019s presidential campaign in 2020. And, last week, she embraced Manchin\u2019s \u201cstrong\u201d provisions as \u201cbasic building blocks\u201d to \u201ccreate a level playing field\u201d and \u201ccreate standards that do not vary from state to state.\u201d Abrams appears sincere in her desire to make some incremental voting reform in lieu of nothing at all, but she\u2019s also one of the smartest strategists in America, and she likely understands how her support for Manchin\u2019s compromise could help her own political ambitions. After watching Trump win the presidency in 2016 because of fewer than 80,000 votes in three states and watching her own campaign barely fall short in another heated election two years later, Abrams knows that even the smallest step that Democrats take to make democracy more accessible could still make a significant difference in a close race. Smerconish: Can Manchin's voting rights compromise sway GOP? Unfortunately, without filibuster reform, even the limited Manchin compromise has no chance of passage in the Senate. But by supporting a compromise with him, Abrams demonstrates that Democrats have exhausted all options to find common ground on voting rights, and this may finally give the West Virginia senator a nudge to reconsider his emphasis on bipartisanship. Perhaps this explains Manchin\u2019s reported willingness to consider lowering the filibuster threshold. Still, Abrams\u2019s unexpected openness for the Manchin compromise exposed both politicians to criticism from the right and left. Despite Manchin\u2019s bewildering fantasy of bipartisanship, Republicans quickly began to attack his plan as hers. \u201cWhen Stacey Abrams immediately endorsed Senator Manchin\u2019s proposal,\u201d Sen. Roy Blunt of Missouri said, \u201cit became the Stacey Abrams substitute, not the Joe Manchin substitute.\u201d This was no surprise. It is easier for Republicans to vilify a 47-year-old Black woman from Atlanta than a 73-year-old White man from West Virginia. Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell, Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and other Republicans followed suit in attacking the Manchin compromise, as well. But progressives had their own concerns about Manchin\u2019s compromise. Rep Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York was quick to oppose Manchin\u2019s voter ID proposal. \u201cI\u2019m not supportive of voter ID, especially nationally, and to impose that, I know New Yorkers don\u2019t want that either,\u201d she said. Ocasio-Cortez is right. Voter ID laws are a solution in search of a problem. Voter fraud is extremely rare in America. Hardly anybody seriously thinks they\u2019re going to be able to change the outcome of a federal election by standing in a long line just so they can cast an illegal vote. If we want to require voter ID, then it should be free and universal, and governments should be required to mail out identification cards to every citizen in their state. Pelosi: Manchin left door ajar on HR1 and I'm not giving up But beyond the question of voter ID, there is concern that another provision in Manchin\u2019s proposed compromise would weaken the John Lewis Voting Rights Act by decreasing the attorney general\u2019s authority to designate a voting rights violation without a judicial finding. It would also prevent the Justice Department from using a consent decree \u2013 an agreement between the department and a local government to stop using discriminatory voting practices \u2013 as proof that a state had violated the Voting Rights Act. So, why is Abrams aligning with Manchin\u2019s flawed proposal? First, her support of the Manchin plan positions Abrams as a consensus builder and makes it harder for Republicans to paint her as a dangerous radical, which some will likely try to do anyway. Abrams ran as a progressive in 2018, and it doesn\u2019t appear that\u2019s likely to change in 2022. But her willingness to compromise could still inoculate her from inevitable GOP attacks. Second, the Manchin compromise, although woefully inadequate for the national voting rights crisis, may be just enough to meet the statewide challenge in Georgia. And even though it would set a new federal mandate for voter ID, the plan would expand the definition of identification to include utility bills and other forms of ID that are more accessible than state driver\u2019s licenses or official state IDs. This is part of the reason why even some Democrats who disagree with voter ID are willing to cut Abrams some slack. Abrams is the Democratic Party\u2019s leading national advocate on voting rights. After helping to deliver Georgia\u2019s 16 electoral votes and two US Senate seats to the Democratic Party in the past year, she has unparalleled credibility to negotiate a voting rights compromise. She also won nearly 2 million votes in her 2018 gubernatorial bid and is expected to mount an aggressive challenge to Republican incumbent Brian Kemp in 2022.  So, this is the truth. Even if Manchin\u2019s watered-down compromise becomes law, it still makes it slightly easier for Abrams to win in Georgia by registering potentially thousands of new voters and eliminating just a few of the many unfair barriers to the franchise. Georgia is ground zero of the nation\u2019s voting rights battle. Abrams lost her 2018 race by nearly 55,000 votes after Kemp, then-Georgia Secretary of State, had purged hundreds of thousands of people from the voting rolls. (Kemp\u2019s office argued that it was normal \u201cvoter roll maintenance\u201d to prevent voter fraud, but low-income and minority voters \u2013 traditionally blue voters \u2013 were more likely to have their registrations canceled, according to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution.) On top of all that, Republicans in Georgia have enacted new voter restrictions this year to make it even harder to vote. That\u2019s a lot of headwind to overcome for a statewide Black Democratic candidate in the South. Surely, Abrams knows better than anyone that Manchin\u2019s proposal won\u2019t get us to the finish line of racial justice for national voting rights. But it may be just enough to help her become America\u2019s first Black woman governor.",

We\u2019re looking back at the strongest, smartest opinion takes of the week from CNN and other outlets. At the age of 89, Opal Lee walked many of the 1,300-plus miles from Fort Worth, Texas, to Washington, DC, to jump-start the campaign to make Juneteenth a national holiday. Now 94, she was at the White House Thursday when President Joe Biden signed the bill to do just that, realizing her goal that was four decades in the making. It took Democrats even longer \u201375 years \u2013 to achieve national health care. And it would be another 11 years before Obamacare decisively survived legal challenges from Republicans determined to kill it:  On the same day as the Juneteenth bill signing, the US Supreme Court tossed out a major lawsuit against the Affordable Care Act. It was tempting to view Thursday\u2019s one-two punch as a signal that progressives have history on their side \u2013 and that there\u2019s more to come.  As the proverb says, \u201cAll things are difficult before they are easy.\u201d But it\u2019s also impossible to ignore the long record of reversals that have followed progress on race and social reform. \u201cIt\u2019s one step forward and three steps back,\u201d as Olivia Rodrigo sings (but in a different context). \u201cThe sad fact of American history,\u201d wrote Peniel E. Joseph, \u201cis that at every time Black Americans have organized and asserted themselves, White backlash mercilessly follows. Look no further than the echo between 19th century post-Reconstruction efforts to suppress Black votes and the 21st century version of that endeavor playing out in GOP-controlled state legislatures today.\u201d The academic construct known as Critical Race Theory, Nicole Hemmer wrote, \u201chas become the song of the summer for right-wing media and politicians, the one they\u2019re playing on repeat, returning to it when they\u2019ve got nothing else on tap.\u201d She argued, \u201cit is serving a useful political purpose: arguing about critical race theory shifts the conversation away from \u2026 challenging issues about equity, affirmative action, reparations, and government intervention to dismantle racist systems \u2014 all of which face significant opposition from the right \u2014 and can only hurt a Republican Party that has grown dependent on the politics of White racial grievance.\u201d Mara Schiavocampo noted that, \u201cCongress is celebrating the liberation of slaves in Texas in 1865. But why is it that they can mobilize such quick bipartisan action on a new federal holiday, but not voting rights legislation to protect Black voters in 2021 (notably those in Texas, facing some of the most restrictive measures)? Why can\u2019t they move with such urgency on anti-lynching legislation to protect Black lives, or the George Floyd Justice in Policing Act to protect Black civil rights? The answer is because it\u2019s much easier to play a role than to live it.\u201d As with other initially controversial programs, like Social Security, wrote Julian Zelizer, the benefits of Obamacare have made it too popular to fail. It\u2019s \u201cbecome an integral part of our health care system. The fury from the town halls that surrounded the program\u2019s passage have been replaced with cheers for the continuation of benefits and regulations that have kept millions of Americans assured they will have health care insurance.\u201d After all the heartache, Obama \u201cwill have the last laugh.\u201d In the wake of the law\u2019s passage in 2010, a young man stopped Obama\u2019s senior adviser David Axelrod on a Chicago street and took off his baseball cap, revealing his hairless head. As Axelrod, recalled, the 27-year-old told him, \u201cI didn\u2019t feel well for a while but didn\u2019t have insurance, so I didn\u2019t go to the doctor.\u201d When he got coverage under the Affordable Care Act, he went for care. \u201cTurns out, I had non-Hodgkin\u2019s Lymphoma, but they caught it in time. I feel like that law saved my life.\u201d Also: Allison Hope: Why we\u2019re nervously celebrating Pride this month The road ahead for Joe Biden looks uncertain, with Democrats unsure if they will have the votes to pass bills on their big priorities: voting rights and infrastructure. But the President now has his first foreign trip in the rear-view mirror \u2013 and the reviews of the weeklong journey to Europe, including his summit with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Switzerland, were mostly positive. \u201cBiden\u2019s next challenge, after the successful summits, is to pass key parts of his domestic legislative agenda over objections from Republicans who seem, weirdly, more antagonistic toward him than Putin,\u201d wrote David Ignatius in the Washington Post. \u201cHe should use the same tactics that worked in his trip abroad. Negotiate with his adversaries but remind them of his hard options. Be a pragmatic centrist, not bipartisan. Make them worry about the political dangers of obstruction\u2026When the whole world seems to be celebrating the fact that America is back, does the GOP really think it can remain in its own bubble of resentment and lies?\u201d Frida Ghitis observed that Biden \u201clooked confident and relaxed\u201d in Geneva while \u201cPutin, who has made an art of appearing smug and almost bored, looked tense and on his guard. Then Biden took the initiative, extending his hand first to Putin, who walked over to grasp it\u2026By meeting with Putin, and letting him showcase his signature evasive style, Biden was able to use the Russian president as a prop \u2014 a show-and-tell for his campaign to demonstrate that authoritarianism is a malign force.\u201d Garry Kasparov, the former world chess champion and democracy advocate, took issue with the view that Biden scored a victory. \u201cDictators love events that put them on an equal footing with democratic leaders and sitting one-on-one with the president of the United States is the most coveted prize of all,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThe foreign audience seemed shocked when Putin said Navalny had only himself to blame for consciously breaking parole by leaving the country \u2013 even though Navalny was evacuated to Germany in a poison-induced coma,\u201d wrote Kasparov, who called it an example of \u201cthe absurd, reality-twisting nonsense Russians are fed 24-7 by the state-controlled media, and Putin was delighted to have the chance to spread it around the world.\u201d SE Cupp, who was deeply critical of former President Donald Trump\u2019s treatment of the media, faulted Biden for missteps, including a peevish response to CNN\u2019s Kaitlan Collins, for which he apologized. \u201cIf ever there were a time to model America\u2019s firm and resolute respect for the First Amendment and freedom of the press, it was here, in front of Putin, with the world watching,\u201d Cupp said. \u201cInstead, Biden kept the media at arms-length and took unnecessary shots at them.\u201d The summit with Putin followed a G7 gathering in the UK that was \u201cbroadly judged a success, with more progress than is often the case at such events, including landmark agreements on vaccine sharing, tackling climate change and a new project to challenge China\u2019s Belt and Road initiative,\u201d wrote Rosa Prince. A friendly tea with the Queen at Windsor Castle wasn\u2019t ruined by Biden\u2019s \u201cspectacular breach of royal protocol in disclosing details of his conversation with the monarch \u2013 she apparently asked for his impressions of Russian President Vladimir Putin and China\u2019s Xi Jinping.\u201d The ideal gift for Father\u2019s Day isn\u2019t something you can order on Amazon and it won\u2019t arrive with two-day shipping. Kara Alaimo suggests that the most life-affirming \u2013 and potentially life-saving \u2013 thing that can be done for dads and their families is to end the culture of overwork that prevails in industries from finance to law and beyond. \u201cProfessionals are expected to be available to their bosses and clients around-the-clock,\u201d she wrote. \u201cHow can both parents in a household hold jobs like this? If both need to be available to run to the office \u2013 or hop on a plane \u2013 on a moment\u2019s notice, who picks up the kids when daycare closes, or when they start running a fever at school?\u201d \u201cMany families, of course, solve this problem by having the dads take the jobs requiring overwork, while moms take jobs with more flexibility for childcare. This isn\u2019t a good solution for anyone involved.\u201d Long hours literally kill people, Alaimo noted, citing a recent study finding that working \u201c55 or more hours per week instead of the standard, more humane 35-40 increases a person\u2019s risk of having a stroke by 35% and the risk of developing heart disease by 17%.\u201d The memory of the January 6 Capitol insurrection is an open wound that shows little sign of healing. Newly released videos further documented the rioters\u2019 assaults on police that day. And the odds of a bipartisan effort to fully investigate the event remain minuscule after the GOP voted against a commission. \u201cIn an ideal world, we would have a vigorous and thorough response from the government,\u201d wrote Julian Zelizer. \u201cThe danger is that we let the horrendous attack on our democracy become yet another fleeting memory in our short attention-span polity, where it is increasingly difficult to dig deep into the crises we experience. This is why others will need to step into the void. Popular culture will be one arena in which the producers of content have the chance to give Americans a better understanding of the factors that allowed that attack to unfold.\u201d Journalism and historical writing are also crucial, he wrote. (Note: CNN is airing \u201cAssault on Democracy: The Roots of Trump\u2019s Insurrection\u201d Sunday at 9 pm ET.) Lawrence Norden and Matthew Weil wrote that while states are passing laws \u201cthat will limit access to voting in the name of baseless election integrity concerns, they have almost entirely ignored a very real existential threat to our democracy: the intimidation of and attacks against election officials. Scapegoated as villains by those who believe the Big Lie of widespread voter fraud in the 2020 election, these officials have become routine targets for harassment and death threats.\u201d  Newly released emails spread light on the Trump administration\u2019s extreme politicization of the Justice Department, wrote Elie Honig, who called them \u201cstark evidence of a White House gone mad.\u201d They included \u201cwild conspiracy theories about election fraud, absurd suggestions on strategy to overturn the already-completed and certified election, desperate entreaties from unhinged fantasists dreaming of flipping the election\u2019s outcome. But these were not junk emails from some trolls \u2013 they were sent from the top echelons of power in the White House to the Justice Department, in a genuine effort to overturn an American election.\u201d Biden\u2019s administration rolled out its strategy this week for countering domestic terrorism. Peter Bergen called it \u201clong overdue,\u201d citing the Capitol riot, the Oklahoma City bombing in 1995 and recent racially and ethnically motivated mass killings. \u201cThe new strategy shows that the US government has finally adopted an overall approach to counter the threat posed by the violent extremists living among us,\u201d wrote Bergen. CNN\u2019s Pentagon reporter Barbara Starr wrote Monday of learning recently about \u201cthe Trump administration\u2019s months long efforts to secretly gain access to tens of thousands of my 2017 work and personal emails and my work and personal phone records.\u201d \u201cAll of this is a sheer abuse of power in my view \u2013 first against CNN and myself, since our work is and should always be protected by the First Amendment. But \u2026 more significantly, it is an abuse against the free press in this country, whether you are a television network correspondent or a reporter at a small town newspaper uncovering wrongdoing.\u201d More than half of Americans are at least partially vaccinated against Covid and life is edging back to normal around the country. But as Dr. Kent Sepkowitz noted, there are places, including parts of the Deep South, where vaccination rates are particularly low, raising the odds of new outbreaks of the disease. The data show that states which voted for Biden have higher vaccination rates than Trump-supporting states, but the political dynamic alone doesn\u2019t explain what\u2019s going on. \u201cTake the elderly, the 65 and up crowd: 87% are at least partially vaccinated, even though they were more evenly split during the 2020 election. Conversely, the younger voters went heavily for Biden but a significant percentage of adults 49 and younger are vaccine averse, according to research from the Kaiser Family Foundation,\u201d Sepkowitz wrote. Jeanne Martinet describes herself as \u201csomeone who essentially mingles for a living. Before the pandemic I went out five or six nights a week. I am a devotee of dinner parties, a promoter of in-person interactions.\u201d But when a friend texted her to join a group of people at an outside table at a local cafe recently, she hesitated. \u201cFor most of us, getting back into the swing of social life feels a bit like coming out of the storm cellar after a tornado. Emerging from our Covid caves, we are blinking our eyes in the sunlight, vaguely nervous, feeling awkward. Is it really okay out here? We also have worries that are akin to stage fright. What can I possibly find to talk about? What if people discover how little I\u2019ve accomplished during the past year?\u201d For another take: Ashish Prashar: If you think adjusting to life after Covid is tough, imagine going through this After a mass shooting took the lives of nine people at a railyard in his city, San Jose, California Mayor Sam Liccardo made news with an innovative proposal to respond to gun violence. \u201cThese proposals include two measures that no other city nor state in the United States has ever tried: mandatory gun insurance to support victims, and mandatory gun fees to compensate taxpayers. As with many other Silicon Valley innovations, we intend to implement and test these ideas, learn from our mistakes, improve, iterate and provide a platform for others to scale them to benefit their own communities.\u201d Requiring insurance promotes \u201csafe gun ownership, where risk-adjusted premiums might encourage owners to take gun-safety courses, use gun safes or install child-safety locks,\u201d an approach similar to the way auto insurance rewards good drivers. Senator Ben Ray Luj\u00e1n and John Feinblatt of Everytown for Gun Safety, argued for closing a gun control loophole:  \u201cRight now, only federally licensed gun dealers are required to run background checks. Private, unlicensed sellers \u2013 even those who sell guns frequently \u2013 are not required to do so. This means that thousands upon thousands of gun sales, including at gun shows and between strangers who meet online, are not subject to a background check.\u201d David M.

View more opinion articles on CNN. The moral panic around critical race theory, an academic legal framework for analyzing structural racism, reached a new level on Glenn Beck\u2019s radio show on Monday. Beck, who specializes in dreaming up bogeymen intent on destroying the United States, warned his audience that critical race theory was coming for everything that defines American culture. \u201cBaseball: unwatchable because of critical race,\u201d he said, before teasing an upcoming segment on its attacks on another American institution: \u201cWait until you hear the critical race theory on apple pie that has just come out \u2014 it\u2019s unbelievable.\u201d Much of the hysteria on the right about critical race theory is unbelievable, but quite a few people believe it all the same. \u201cCritical Race Theory\u201d has become the song of the summer for right-wing media and politicians, the one they\u2019re playing on repeat, returning to it when they\u2019ve got nothing else on tap. And while there\u2019s nothing particularly novel about this particular moral panic, it is serving a useful political purpose: arguing about critical race theory shifts the conversation away from the continued consequences of structural racism. That conversation opens up challenging issues about equity, affirmative action, reparations, and government intervention to dismantle racist systems \u2014 all of which face significant opposition from the right \u2014 and can only hurt a Republican Party that has grown dependent on the politics of White racial grievance. We know that because right-wing media have attempted to use critical race theory as a cudgel before. That previous effort, which occurred in 2012 and was ginned up largely by the website Breitbart News, fell flat because it was not tied to a larger debate about racism. Instead, it was part of an effort to damage President Barack Obama during his reelection campaign by tying him to the founder of critical race theory, Derrick Bell. What having Juneteenth as a federal holiday won't do Critical race theory, though in practice it took many forms, emphasized the centrality of structural racism and the way institutions like the law, while seeming race-neutral, actually upheld and recreated racist practices, policies, and outcomes. That cut against the optimistic narratives about the triumph of 1960s civil rights legislation and national progress, and so tended to be controversial. Conservative media outlets had argued for years that Obama had been insufficiently vetted before becoming president and regularly suggested that he had a closet full of anti-White skeletons. Having mostly abandoned the attacks on his citizenship after the release of his long-form birth certificate in 2011, they moved on to his school transcripts and his ties to incendiary figures. They had used up their attacks on the Rev. Jeremiah Wright and Bill Ayers (a member of the Weather Underground in the 1970s) during the 2008 campaign, so in 2012, they were looking for someone new. Enter Derrick Bell. In 1991, when Obama was in his final year of law school at Harvard University, Bell organized a protest after the university denied tenure to Regina Austin, a Black professor (at the time, Harvard Law School had only three Black professors and five women professors, and Obama was serving as the Law Review\u2019s first Black president). Obama not only supported the protest, but there was also video showing he had \u2014 gasp! \u2014 hugged Bell. For some, this video served as evidence of Obama\u2019s covert radicalism. It bounced around sites like Fox News and the Daily Signal, and Breitbart flogged the story for months, trying to gain traction. But it ultimately petered out, and the phrase \u201ccritical race theory\u201d returned to the relative obscurity of academia and activist philosophizing. Why didn\u2019t the moral panic take hold then? The Bell story broke in early March, a few weeks after Trayvon Martin\u2019s murder but a week or two before it had become a national story. The Black Lives Matter movement would not become widely known until 2013, and the 2012 election would be more focused on the Republican \u201cwar on women\u201d than a national debate about racism. There was no urgent need on the right to distract from conversations about race. That changed in the years that followed. But the right-wing backlash against Black Lives Matter did not take the form of opposition to critical race theory, in part because it had little overt connection to education. Nor, at first, did the anger over the New York Times Magazine\u2019s 1619 Project, which placed slavery and its aftermath at the center of the story of the United States. It took the mass protests of 2020 over the murder of George Floyd, and the efforts of conservative activists and right-wing media, to spark a real moral panic over critical race theory. What having Juneteenth as a federal holiday won't do One key figure here was Christopher Rufo, a right-wing activist who carried out a campaign against diversity training in 2020. Rufo, a regular on Fox News, framed diversity training as an extension of critical race theory, a case he made repeatedly on Tucker Carlson\u2019s show. And because it was on Fox News, President Donald Trump was watching \u2014 and tweeting \u2014 about it. The one-two punch of propaganda and the president made attacks on critical race theory a national story, and a right-wing moral panic. Like any good moral panic, it has spread through both repetition and innovation. Fox News has mentioned \u201ccritical race theory\u201d more than 1,300 times since March, according to a study from Media Matters for America. That has turned the words into a kind of catchphrase, a signal to conservative audiences of the New Bad Thing penetrating every part of American life. But it also draws on old, familiar political fights: Battles in the 1990s over the content of history curricula and White angst over everything from \u201creverse racism\u201d to \u201cBlack identity extremism.\u201d And like any good moral panic, its creation was deliberate. As Rufo bragged on Twitter, he and his allies had turned \u201ccritical race theory\u201d into a slogan, one that they had inserted \u201cinto the public conversation and are steadily driving up negative perceptions. We will eventually turn it toxic, as we put all of the various cultural insanities under that brand category.\u201d Given how the phrase now saturates not only right-wing media but state legislation, it\u2019s fair to say they have succeeded.  All of this is why it is important to expose that none of this hysteria is not really about critical race theory itself, but about derailing the debate about racial inequality and police brutality that seized the nation with particular force a year ago. The footage of George Floyd\u2019s murder was so brutal, the injustice and immorality so clear, that there was no effective political argument against it. Unable to win the debate about the continuing consequences of racist policies and actions, right-wing activists are now working to sidestep it. Preventing them from doing so is the best way to honor \u2014 and continue \u2014 last year\u2019s protests.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Diana Butler Bass (@DianaButlerBass) is the author of 11 books on American religion and cultural trends, including her most recent, \u201cFreeing Jesus: Rediscovering Jesus as Friend, Teacher, Savior, Lord, Way and Presence.\u201d The views expressed here are hers. Read more opinion on CNN. The Southern Baptist Convention in Nashville this week narrowly elected a less hard-line leader in Ed Litton, but don\u2019t be fooled: this meeting largely confirmed that the victory of what the SBC calls the \u201cconservative resurgence\u201d of the 1980s endures. At this year\u2019s SBC, not a single candidate or leader questioned conservative orthodoxy. Instead, outgoing president J.D. Greear praised the previous generation for their victory over theological liberalism. He did, however, criticize how political the denomination had become in recent years, stressing that older battles had calcified into a form of self-righteousness. In effect, he applauded the core message while questioning the attitudes of some of its adherents. With 14 million members, the SBC is the world\u2019s largest global body of Baptists and the biggest Protestant association in the United States. Their annual meeting, which often reflects larger trends in Republican politics and social issues, always makes news. Last year\u2019s convention was postponed due to Covid-19, and, in the intervening months, internal tensions swelled over racism, sexism and the handling of accusations of sexual abuse. Of particular focus has been critical race theory (CRT), which the 2019 gathering had approved for use in SBC institutions as an \u201canalytical\u201d tool \u201csubordinate to Scripture.\u201d Their carefully worded and conditional approval was seen by many in the denomination as evidence of a leftward drift, and resurgent conservatives organized in advance of the 2021 meeting to stop further spread of what they believe to be anti-biblical ideas. For weeks, as internal pre-convention fights spilled into public view \u2013 most notably a letter from Dr. Russell Moore detailing his reasoning for departing the SBC \u2013 mainstream news and social media were alight with talk of a possible schism, a potential split between a hyper-conservative group with Trump-influenced politics (who backed Georgia pastor Mike Stone\u2019s candidacy to lead SBC) and a more moderate-conservative group willing to address some concerns of racial injustice and sexual misconduct in their ranks (who supported Litton, an Alabama pastor). White evangelicals after Trump: What now? In a surprise move Tuesday, delegates rejected the far-right, anti-CRT candidate for the lesser-known pastor with a history of working toward racial reconciliation. The vote was close, the new president winning by a small 2% margin revealing a sizable division in the denomination. The losing candidate was gracious, but his supporters were quick to say that they would continue their fight. The convention, meanwhile, seems to have continued in a status quo direction by voting down some of the most draconian resolutions proposed by the radical conservatives (such as a harsh condemnation of women who had abortions), and referring action on more controversial issues (such as handling charges of sexual abuse) to committees. Those who anticipated \u2013 or even hoped for \u2013 a schism in the SBC will go away from this meeting disappointed, and there will be more than one opinion piece written about how the moderating outcome of the SBC might quietly signal the end of extreme Trumpism in White evangelicalism. But the truth of the matter is that there are no clear winners. This week was just another skirmish in a very long history of what sociologist Nancy Ammerman called the \u201cBaptist battles.\u201d Watching this week\u2019s meeting unfold took me back to an autumn day in 1987 in Durham, North Carolina. I was grading papers from my Duke Divinity School students; in the background, the television was tuned to afternoon soap operas. The program abruptly stopped, the local news anchor appeared on screen and announced a breaking news story: \u201cFundamentalists take over Southeastern Seminary in Wake Forest. News at 6.\u201d Southeastern, known for academic excellence and theological inclusion (having educated the first woman to be ordained as a Southern Baptist pastor), was the latest seminary to succumb to a then-raging conservative crusade against liberalism in the denomination. US history holds a chilling warning about restricting votes Southern Baptists had been fighting since the late 1970s over a so-called leftward drift in the denomination. The seventies were the high-water mark of progressive evangelicalism, a social activist brand of conservative Protestantism (represented by figures like Jim Wallis and Sojourners magazine) that was widely popular, especially among younger evangelical Christians who opposed to the Vietnam War, embraced feminism and civil rights and sought to address economic injustice. In 1976, they had coalesced around the election of Jimmy Carter, a Southern Baptist evangelical, whose concerns largely reflected their own. But conservative evangelicals never liked or trusted their more progressive kin, accusing them of embracing liberal culture more than following the dictates of Scripture. In the same year that Jimmy Carter was elected, they launched a counterattack in the form of a book entitled \u201cThe Battle for the Bible.\u201d Its author, Harold Lindsell, a seminary professor and the powerful editor of Christianity Today magazine, warned that evangelical progressives no longer believed that the Bible was the inerrant word of God. Feminism, social justice, racial equality \u2013 all these things resulted from liberal biblical criticism and liberation theology. He called for a crusade to purify the ranks. In 1981, Lindsell addressed the Southern Baptist Convention, saying: \u201cThe only Jesus I know is the Jesus of the Bible. There is no other Jesus. If the liberal critics are right and Jesus didn\u2019t say half of the things that are attributed to him, then I\u2019ve got some real problems, because I can\u2019t be sure that even the things they attribute to him (are things) he really said.\u201d Pastor: 'There are Tulsas across this country' The battle for the Bible raged in evangelical institutions, especially in colleges and seminaries, but nowhere did it have a greater impact than in the Southern Baptist Convention. Conservatives took up Lindsell\u2019s call and turned the fight over biblical inerrancy into a battle to save the denomination and American society from the evils of liberalism. As Baptist fundamentalists gained power, they fired seminary faculty, kicked out pastors and congregations and manipulated the church\u2019s governing structures to serve conservative political ends. They played a key role in the emergence of Moral Majority and the religious right, recruiting a majority of Southern Baptists as a voting bloc for the Republican Party. In the 1980s, fearing the possibility of regional isolation and cultural death, many SBC leaders believed that they could attract new members by spreading the Good News of God\u2019s hierarchy by political means through the Republican Party. It seemed to work at first, but ultimately, it didn\u2019t. Many Baptists left and formed alternative denominational fellowships. Growth slowed, plateaued and began a dramatic decline. The SBC is now smaller than it was in 1987, the year of the fundamentalist takeover of the seminary in Wake Forest. Defeating liberalism has not grown the church. The political message of a godly hierarchy of White men isn\u2019t good news to most Americans \u2013 especially younger ones, even today\u2019s leaders\u2019 own children, many of whom have embraced equality and pluralism. Now what? Ed Litton and SBC leadership are left with a nearly impossible task \u2013 maintain a conservative and traditionalist reading of the Bible while embracing race and gender equality in hopes of tempering what many younger Americans see as the political hypocrisy and sin embedded in the Trump-aligned wing of the SBC. At best, at least right now, this will likely result in tinkering around institutional edges in an effort to soften their image \u2013 without any theological change \u2013 hoping to keep more people of color, women, and young adults from leaving the church.  Meanwhile, the anti-CRT ultraconservatives haven\u2019t given up just because their candidate didn\u2019t take the SBC presidency. They want to maintain both the political and purity tests of the SBC. \u201cIf we do not prevail today, we will come back next year and the next year and the next year,\u201d hard-line conservative leader Rod Martin told a group of supporters this week. Most of Jesus\u2019s apostles, he pointed out, were eventually martyred. \u201cWe are here to the death! We will not stop.\u201d George Marsden, the noted historian of American fundamentalism, often quipped that a fundamentalist is an evangelical who is mad about something. Once again, the Southern Baptist Convention has shown that America has no shortage of fundamentalists. And right now, in this first year post-Trump, they seem to be mostly mad at their own family.",

He\u2019s the author of the book \u201cLatinx: The New Force in American Politics and Culture.\u201d The views expressed are his own. View more opinion articles on CNN. From its opening sequence, Lin Manuel Miranda\u2019s new film \u201cIn the Heights\u201d (adapted from the stage musical of the same name) spells out its Disney-ish conceit for the audience. \u201cOnce upon a time in a far-away land called Nueva York,\u201d his lead character Usnavi, played by Anthony Ramos, assures a group of small children seated around him at a mythical Caribbean beach. \u201cThe streets were made of music.\u201d From there, the audience is constantly reminded that those streets were also made of light-and-sweet coffee from uptown bodegas, a smorgasbord of Caribbean cuisine, sex-positive beauty salon gossip, and of course, hot salsa and merengue dancing. But as this extended piece of eye and ear candy unfolds, one has to wonder, haven\u2019t we seen this before? Does representation of Latinos in the US always come down to these what might be called positive stereotypes, a kind of endless Busby Berkeley routine previously tropicalized in works like \u201cWest Side Story,\u201d \u201cThe Mambo Kings\u201d and \u201cLa Bamba?\u201d Ultimately, \u201cIn the Heights,\u201d for all its wholesome escapism, also reveals the limits of Hollywood\u2019s idea of representation. With its $55 million budget, this nearly two and a half hour extravaganza has been positioned to take a lead role in American film-goers\u2019 return to the theaters this summer. Delayed by a year because of the pandemic, and even longer than that because studios wanted big-name casting, \u201cIn the Heights\u201d wants to shake you out of your Netflix slumber with a form of feel-good musical magic that some think is rapidly becoming obsolete. 'Crazy Rich Asians' director on diversity in Hollywood and new movie 'In the Heights' The formula is well-executed: take one part lyricist/rapper Miranda, a helping of \u201cCrazy Rich Asians\u201d director Jon M. Chu, and a dash of choreographer Christopher Scott, who worked on one of the \u201cStep Up\u201d dance films with Chu, and you should have a massive success. This is borne out on many levels: Star turns by Anthony Ramos, Melissa Barrera (Vanessa), Leslie Grace (Nina) and Corey Hawkins (Benny) can make them more viable as bankable performers, and much of the Latino cast stands out in a moment when overall in Hollywood, actors of their background have very little visibility. Many of the themes of Latino life in the US, such as struggles with debt, racial and ethnic discrimination and the difficulty of acculturating are put on display with competence and precision in this film. The characters\u2019 rhyme-spitting in English, Spanish and Spanglish, a central part of the tricky task of portraying its fusion of African- and Anglo-American culture and language with home country tradition, is spot on for the most part. Lin-Manuel Miranda sings for separated families The political urgency of the original Broadway production seems to have been toned down a bit, however \u2013 particularly when it comes to the gentrification that menaces urban barrios like Washington Heights. The opening sequence of the film promises a meditation on \u201ca block that was disappearing,\u201d and there are some allusions to demographic change in which wealthier renters, homeowners and shopkeepers push up rent prices to threaten affordability of the residents. A new dry cleaner wants to charge inflated prices, sending shock waves to eye-rolling residents, a beauty salon business is being forced to move out; an entire way of life for a long-time Latino barrio is on shaky ground. But overall, the film focuses more on the love stories between the lead character, reluctant bodega owner Usnavi and aspiring graphic artist Vanessa, as well as the romance between Stanford undergraduate Nina, who is Puerto Rican, and taxi dispatcher Benny, who is African-American. To its credit, \u201cIn the Heights\u201d does address some real-world social issues relevant to Washington Heights, such as the difficulty faced by urban Latinos who decide to attend elite universities. Nina expresses strong reluctance to return to Stanford in part because of micro-aggressions she receives from fellow students \u2013 on one occasion, her White roommate accuses her of stealing jewelry from her. But despite the many Dominican characters there\u2019s little focus in the film on the Afro-Dominican world of the real Washington Heights. Goya CEO under fire for false Trump election claims Much of the action also centers around Usnavi\u2019s bodega, the small convenience store that has become the ultimate signifier of urban authenticity \u2013 so much so that New York City Mayoral Candidate Andrew Yang posted a video professing his love for them. Its cramped spaces are the site of intimate conversations about life and awkward flirtation. Even as Usnavi approaches Vanessa, the camera lingers on a product-placement fest of ethnic staples, notably omitting Goya products, banished no doubt for their CEO\u2019s endorsement of former President Donald Trump, occasionally interrupted by Sonny, Usnavi\u2019s younger cousin who provides the film\u2019s comic relief and the film\u2019s most viable voice representing a desire for social change . Yet rather than portraying real resistance to gentrification, the story of \u201cIn the Heights\u201d largely presents neighborhood changes as inevitable and promotes the idea that pride in Latino identity is the most important thing to protect. Beauty shop owner Daniela (played by Daphne Rubin-Vega) is sarcastically stoic as she resigns herself to moving her shop far away to the Bronx, declaring she can survive anywhere. Her annoyance about the neighborhood\u2019s indifference to her move sets off one of the film\u2019s most eye-catching set pieces, \u201cCarnaval del Barrio,\u201d a rollicking impromptu dance party in the middle of a blackout that has strong echoes of the \u201cAmerica\u201d scene on a Manhattan rooftop in \u201cWest Side Story.\u201d Ted Cruz says no Latino uses the term 'Latinx.' Some do, and the reasons are not simple \u201cCarnaval del Barrio\u201d attempts to create the kind of unified Latino community, at least in New York terms, that many Latino Americans strongly criticized during the 2020 election cycle for being treated as artificially monolithic. Members of the Puerto Rican, Dominican, Mexican and Cuban communities take their turns during the number to wave their national flags, a gesture that may or may not resonate out West or in South Florida. This display of community, however, seems to take the place of more practical forms of political organizing or awareness. \u201cMaybe this neighborhood is changing forever, Maybe this is our last night together,\u201d Usnavi sings, \u201cY\u2019all could cry with your head in the sand, I\u2019m a fly this flag that I got in my hand.\u201d While the assertion of pride in a marginalized identity is political by nature, relying solely on identity politics as a vehicle for political expression can shift necessary attention away from social class. In a film as likely to attain stratospheric success as \u201cIn The Heights,\u201d the artistic choice to conflate identity with protest feels like a massive opportunity lost. The underlying mantra that most permeates the film version of \u201cIn the Heights\u201d is not about politics or social protest at all, but about the sue\u00f1itos, or little dreams, that various characters have \u2013 Vanessa\u2019s desire to be a fashion designer, car-service owner Rosario\u2019s dream that his daughter Nina graduate from Stanford, Usnavi\u2019s dream of moving back to the Dominican Republic. These dreams resonate more with the Horatio Alger story Miranda grafted onto Alexander Hamilton; they clash when layered onto the original \u201cIn The Heights,\u201d with its critique of out of control real estate developers who create a lack of affordable housing. Instead of overt social protest, \u201cIn the Heights\u201d settles for the quiet dignity of a line delivered by Olga Merediz\u2019s Abuela Claudia, about how she survived emigrating from Cuba to New York in 1943: \u201cWe had to assert our dignity in small ways, little details that tell the world we are not invisible.\u201d  The purported solution to the problems faced by the film\u2019s central characters is the unlikely prospect of winning the state lottery. While the lottery sets off the film\u2019s most impressive musical segment, the hip-hop flavored \u201c96,000,\u201d it provides Usnavi, who inherits the ticket from the suddenly passed-on Abuela Claudia, with cash to hold onto his bodega and stay in the Heights, start a family with Vanessa and pay legal expenses to help Sonny get permanent resident status. There\u2019s nothing inherently wrong with escapism per se \u2013 Latinos, like everyone else, have gone through an unimaginable period of sacrifice, including losing the considerable joys of social gathering. That space of escape \u2013 defying gravity, like Benny and Nina do in one climatic scene, dancing up the side of a Washington Heights apartment building \u2013 can be crucial to providing a way to gather thoughts and energies for future challenges. Yet it is still disappointing that for a politically and culturally fragmented community still struggling with the devastation of Covid on their communities, widespread housing segregation, and disproportionate exposure to unjust police violence \u201cIn the Heights\u201d offers a prescription of singing and dancing, with a social argument coded in quiet dignity and little details that will have to do. An earlier version of this op-ed wrongly described the background of the character of Nina. Her character is Puerto Rican.",

View more opinion on CNN. As a curator of political history at the Smithsonian, I\u2019ve spent years studying the bad old days of American politics. Leafing through contested election trial transcripts, constable\u2019s reports and boxes of fraudulent ballots, I\u2019ve studied the voter suppression and violence that was once a common feature of our democracy in the 19th century. It always seemed distant to me, with a consoling \u201cit used to be worse\u201d appeal. But recently, this past has been reanimated by new, partisan state laws designed to make it harder to vote. Having spent years researching how similar policies affected democracy in the 19th century, I can say: America, please don\u2019t go down this road again. We already know what happens if we do. In fact, there are a few crucial lessons to learn from similar efforts in the past. The first lesson is that tightening access to the vote hurts democracy for everyone. History shows that individual state laws can greatly encourage, or discourage, popular political participation nationwide, fundamentally altering American political culture. Consider the arc of American democracy from the 1820s to the 1920s. Beginning in the 1820s, most states stopped requiring that White males own property to vote, opening voting access to working class and younger voters. Turnouts shot up from roughly 25% of eligible voters in the 1820s, to over 80% in 1840, 1860 and 1876. We saddled up to make sure Native Americans got to vote After the Civil War, African-American men won the right to vote, joining in popular elections to elect former slaves as sheriffs, congressmen and governors. Though women\u2019s suffrage was still far off, many Americans believed that they lived in a progressive era of expanding \u201cpure democracy,\u201d with old racial and class hierarchies and voting restrictions being swept away by a populist tide. But this wave crested around the centennial in 1876, and for the next 50 years, so-called \u201creformers\u201d worked to restrict access again. In the South, White supremacists introduced new laws designed to bring about what one White Virginia legislator called, \u201cthe elimination of the negro from the politics of this state.\u201d New state constitutions kept most Black men from voting; the number of African American voters in Louisiana, for instance, crashed from 130,000 in 1896 to just 1,342 by 1904. Lynchings often enforced this new disenfranchisement with a chilling message to Black would-be voters and activists. In those same years, faith in democracy also plummeted across the nation. Although never experiencing anything like the brutality of Southern politics, after the contentious presidential election of 1876 many Northern elites began to denounce majority rule in politics. In the Gilded Age, well-to-do Americans looked out at the big, populist democracy with mass participation by working class and immigrant voters, and began to mutter about the \u201cpublic pest\u201d of popular voting rights. Northern states passed their own laws designed with what one observer at the time termed the \u201csecret cause\u201d of discouraging poorer voters, and well-connected politicians noted a \u201creaction against democracy\u201d in elite circles. A Confederate flag at the Capitol summons America's demons Turnout crumbled. Between 1896 and 1924, participation plunged from 80% back to less than 50%, and remained mediocre for much of the next century. African-Americans and working class whites \u2013 the populations promised the most by the \u201cpure democracy\u201d optimism after the Civil War \u2013 were hit the hardest. The lesson is clear \u2013 a culture of participation can be built, as between 1820 and 1876, and it can also be destroyed, as over the next 50 years. Another clear lesson from the 19th century is that election losers\u2019 claims of fraud are an easy weapon to reduce turnout.  While there is no credible evidence of significant fraud in American elections today, there certainly was plenty back in the 1800s. But what is most striking is how similar the unsubstantiated claims of fraud made by White Southern Democrats made against new Black voters after the Civil War \u2013 or lodged by losing parties in the North \u2013 sound to what we hear today. One senator who complained, in 1874, that conspiracy theorists treated every elected official \u201cas if he were a vulgar trickster,\u201d sounds distressingly like the Texas election official who worried last month about \u201cthe default assumption that county election officials are bad actors.\u201d What Jim Crow looks like in 2021 Perhaps even more menacingly familiar than the new state laws restricting voting are the efforts to reintroduce partisan poll watchers on Election Day. This is the new development that causes me the most concern, because the record is so clear about the harm of turning polling places into partisan battle-domes. Throughout most of the 1800s, partisan poll watchers, \u201cchallengers,\u201d \u201cshoulder hitters\u201d and \u201cbludgeon men\u201d patrolled polling places, using intimidation, \u201cknock downs\u201d and \u201cawlings\u201d (literally stabbing voters with awls) to swing elections. Often, partisan poll watchers clashed with rivals from the other side, as in one municipal election in Baltimore in 1859, which left eight shot, four stabbed and two dozen beaten across the city. Americans grew used to post-election reports of what headlines called such \u201coutrages at the polls.\u201d Enabling partisan poll-watchers inevitably draws similar activists from the other side, launching a spiraling arms race at elections. And as many of these laws are being introduced in battleground states, like Florida, Texas and Georgia, it\u2019s not hard to imagine rival poll-watchers clashing on Election Day and making it impossible for ordinary voters to safely cast a ballot.  After a career studying the \u201cdirty tricks\u201d of the 19th century in the archives, I\u2019m amazed to see them dreamt up again in the 21st. Of course, it\u2019s not as if these latter-day suppressors are doing their historical research, they are merely falling back on the logic of partisanship, as were the Democrats and Republicans who introduced these ideas 150 years ago. As long as legislators value a win for their tribe over a win for the majority, they will continue to get dangerously creative on Election Day. One of the strengths of American democracy is its continuity: we\u2019ve operated under the same basic system of government for longer than nearly any other nation on earth. Which means we have a deep record of what reforms help \u2013 and what reforms harm \u2013 the cause of popular self-government. We\u2019ve learned too much about voting rights and voter suppression over the centuries to blunder into some of our old, ugly missteps again today. By this point, we should know better.",

A Black Man in Trumpland.\u201d The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion on CNN. During an interview with CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper on Monday, former President Barack Obama said he is \u201cstill the hope and change guy.\u201d When Obama was first elected, I was a hope and change guy, too. I no longer am in part because of what this country revealed itself to be in response to a Black family taking residence inside a White House built by slaves. It was painful watching him across from Cooper diagnosing what ails this nation, explaining why democracies don\u2019t die with one grand punch but rather by a thousand little cuts. That fateful night that Obama won the presidency in November 2008 seems a lifetime ago. As the election returns dribbled in and it became clear we would be electing the first Black man to lead the most powerful nation on the planet, I decided to drive to Wedgefield Plantation in Georgetown, South Carolina, one of more than 150 rice plantations in its county where enslaved Africans toiled during the height of the antebellum era. I wanted to be with the ancestors, those who endured to make a President Obama possible. I wanted to be the first to let them know how far we had come. I parked my truck between a rotting slave cabin and a pool house on hundreds of acres of land that were redeveloped into a residential community with a country club and tennis courts and well-manicured golf holes. Obama had shown the world that we were ready to step out of our racist past \u2014 not into a post-racial society but something better, stronger, a society in which dark skin would become less of an impediment to the ultimate success, if only just a little. \u201cNo more,\u201d I wrote then for The Sun News in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, about the significance of Obama\u2019s victory, \u201cdo we have the luxury of assuming the worst because we are afraid that divided days of yesteryear will mean divided days tomorrow.\u201d Then came the overt racism, including from members of a mostly white evangelical church I had been attending. Then came Donald Trump using the bigoted birtherism lie to work his way up the ranks of the Republican Party. Then came all-out GOP opposition to Obama\u2019s political agenda \u2014 even his efforts to dig us out of what then was the greatest economic downturn since the Great Depression. Obama recalls when his daughters participated in BLM protests Then came the anxiety of White people at the fact a Black man was president. Obama had gone from the Black dude proudly telling us there were no blue states or red states to being perceived as the tip of a demographic spear that was scaring the heck of not a few White Americans because it meant their majority was dwindling. Still, I hoped. In my professional life, I more confidently took risks that paid off, inspired by Obama\u2019s example. In my personal life, I could tell my kids that the Obamas had nappy-happy hair, too, and were living in the White House. I felt more fully American than I ever had. We\u2019ve drifted so far from those days, Obama told Cooper. Still, he said: \u201cIt\u2019s also important for us to figure out how do we start once again being able to tell a common story about where this country goes.\u201d I don\u2019t know where to start that process. We are in a period during which not even a literal attempted insurrection on our capital could bring us together. Since January 6, the Republican Party has kept passing new laws designed to restrict the vote of people they\u2019d rather not bother trying to reach and decided that hyper-partisanship was more important than Covid-19 relief for desperate Americans if a Democratic president might get credit. More disturbingly, they\u2019ve continued to spread the lie that the election was stolen from Trump and are so committed to that alternate reality that not even the few longtime Republicans who have spoken the truth can convince them otherwise. To top it off, a Democratic senator from West Virginia is so blinded by his narrow definition of bipartisanship, he\u2019s willing to allow the GOP to undermine democracy itself. Obama reflects on 'Becoming a Man' program Our nearly 250-year-old experiment is bleeding to death from a thousand small cuts, not by the bayonet or Russian bomb. And in a real sense, it began the moment the country decided to defy its own racist past to elect a Black man in the form of Obama. That\u2019s why it was so hard to watch him with Cooper maintaining the same calm demeanor he clung to no matter what happened during his eight years in office. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect that there would be so few people who would say, \u2018Well, I don\u2019t mind losing my office because this is too important. America is too important. Our democracy is too important,\u2019\u201d Obama said. \u201cMy hope is that the tides will turn. But that does require each of us to understand that this experiment in democracy is not self-executing. It doesn\u2019t happen just automatically. It happens because each successive generation says these values, these truths we hold self-evident, this is important. We\u2019re going to invest in it and sacrifice for it. And we\u2019ll stand up for it, even when it\u2019s not politically convenient.\u2019\u201d  I\u2019m glad Obama is still the hope and change guy. His ability to hold fast to that vision during a time such as this is admirable and should be emulated. It was particularly poignant watching him sitting across from Cooper and a handful of young Black men discussing the importance of education, maturity and fatherhood. It was a reminder for me of what his example once did for me. \u201cMy hope is that the tides will turn,\u201d the former president told Cooper. This country surprised me before 13 years ago when it did the previously unthinkable. I hope it surprises me again.",

Just when you thought internal Republican politics could not get any more dysfunctional and bizarre, last week was very revealing. Take the three-way split screen of former Speaker of the House Paul Ryan\u2019s speech at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library in California last Thursday, juxtaposed against GOP Reps. Matt Gaetz and Marjorie Taylor Greene\u2019s spectacle of ignorance and grievance in Georgia, all while Senate Republicans tanked the independent, bipartisan commission charged with investigating the violent insurrection of January 6. Ryan, a good friend with whom I served in Congress and who is passionately devoted to conservative ideals in the tradition of Ronald Reagan and his mentor, Jack Kemp, stated many hard truths that speak to the soul-crushing experience of Donald Trump\u2019s presidency and the state of the GOP now. \u201cIt was horrifying to see a presidency come to such a dishonorable and disgraceful end\u2026. we conservatives find ourselves at a crossroads and here\u2019s the reality that we have to face. If the conservative cause depends on the populist appeal of one personality or of second-rate imitations, then we\u2019re not going anywhere. Voters looking for Republican leaders want to see independence in mettle. They will not be impressed by the sight of yes-men and flatterers flocking to Mar-a-Lago,\u201d he said. I agree with everything Ryan said. Strong words, to be sure. What concerned me most about so many traditional conservatives during the Trump presidency was not their words but their silence and lack of meaningful action to resist the unprincipled cronyism pushed by the former president when they controlled the levers of power. We were often told then of the need to work with President Trump and quietly persuade him behind the scenes to challenge or redirect his worst impulses. I never bought into that way of thinking. Given Trump\u2019s assault on core GOP principles, the futility of behind-the-scenes diplomacy represented a feeble cop-out that caused me and others to question many traditional conservatives\u2019 devotion to the ideals and values they had so often championed and espoused. Take free trade as an example of conservative capitulation to Trump. Republicans like me for years promoted opening markets through bilateral and multilateral free trade agreements. When Donald Trump imposed tariffs on Canadian steel and aluminum in 2018 (which were lifted a year later) in the name of national security, I suggested blocking him by requiring a vote of Congress to approve such tariffs, which are taxes paid by American consumers and businesses. Just when you think GOP couldn't get more extreme, along comes Marjorie Taylor Greene My pleas were greeted with crickets, even though few of my colleagues disagreed with my remedy. It was somehow better to insult America\u2019s closest friend and ally than to upset the mercurial president. This pattern of Trump trampling on traditional GOP beliefs manifested itself in other ways on issues like cutting US financial contributions to the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO), showing a soft spot for Russia and its authoritarian leader, national security and the broader role of government, like ignoring fiscal restraint. Had a Democratic president proposed such reckless policies, a GOP Congress would have set itself on fire in opposition. This kind of weakness, failure to speak out publicly and lack of legislative action on substantive policy matters created a political vacuum for extreme voices like Reps. Gaetz and Greene, who have gained a foothold in the GOP with their politics of grievance, conspiracy theories, nativism, nihilism and dishonesty. We are now living with the consequences. Owning the libs, whining about the transgendered in women\u2019s sports, promoting the discredited stolen election lie, and above all else, pledging fidelity to Trump have emboldened the extremists and given voice to their crackpottery. As a former chairman of the House Ethics Committee, I can assure you there was a time when members of Congress like Gaetz and Greene who became embarrassing distractions hid from public view and were often forced to resign to avoid bringing further shame upon themselves, their families and constituents. Now these members despicably monetize their notoriety by claiming victim status and relentless media witch hunts. So much for maintaining standards of conduct. Ryan rightly took some steps to address grievance and identity politics when he said, \u201cour party must be defined by more than a tussle over the latest grievance or perceived slight. We must not let them take priority over solutions grounded in principle to improve people\u2019s lives, because politics based on racial or other identity is always a path to deeper and deeper hostility, with sad and harmful consequences, and it is precisely the opposite of conservative thought. Today, too many people on the right are enamored with identity politics in ways that are antithetical to Reagan conservatism.\u201d  I only wish Ryan pushed back harder when he had the gavel. Left unspoken in his California remarks were any mention of GOP leaders currently in the trenches like his friend and mentor Sen. Mitt Romney, and Reps. Liz Cheney, Adam Kinzinger, Peter Meijer, John Katko and others who are taking relentless fire from dark forces too dominant in the party and enraged by the impeachment votes of these courageous members. Here\u2019s to hoping that my friend Paul Ryan uses his board position at the Fox Corporation, the parent company of Fox News, to address the issues he raised in California and to remove from the platform those who promote the ugly politics he so forcefully condemned.",

View more opinion articles on CNN. One year after George Floyd\u2019s murder, America finds itself at an existential crossroads: this nation can create a multiracial democracy that guarantees Black citizenship and dignity \u2013 or sustain the status quo of racial oppression undergirded by White supremacy. For a brief moment, dramatic \u2013 even revolutionary \u2013 change seemed not just possible, but inevitable. Black Lives Matter activists created an indelible image of a beloved community whose reach could surpass the political achievements of the civil rights movement. When 15,000 turned out in Brooklyn for a BLM march in support of Black Trans Lives, you could feel history\u2019s pulsating throb in real time. Black women, many of them queer and feminist, led many of these efforts. They were joined by Latinx, indigenous, Asian American and Pacific Islander and White communities who found moral and political renewal in acknowledging Black lives mattered as much as their own. Breonna Taylor, a Black woman killed by Louisville police while sleeping in her bed, posthumously graced the cover of Vanity Fair in a kind of historic recognition of the value of Black women so often denied them (even in national conversations about Black death). The potential for democratic transformation seemed immense. That possibility, in much of the year since, has at best progressed into a raised national consciousness about the realities of systemic racism and, at worst, devolved into a politicized shouting match over whether America is or is not a racist country, a searing battle about to whom our history belongs. But that summer of protest, that collective national breath we took, still matters because the structures of violence that brought it to the fore remain with us. A year after George Floyd: A letter to my Black son In death George Floyd did more than join a litany of Black martyrs such as Emmett Till, killed at the altar of White supremacy. Viral images of Floyd\u2019s anguished last breaths and the sound of his calls for his momma forced Americans to confront some hard truths about our past. 2020\u2019s summer of racial justice protests also served as a global touchstone that offered lessons about the way in which concepts of police brutality, racial disparities connected to the pandemic, public school segregation and White privilege were all rooted in America\u2019s original sin of chattel slavery. In the year since Floyd\u2019s killing, this galvanized movement for racial justice has brought us to a Dickensian moral fork in the road. Propelled by the tragedy of Floyd\u2019s death, for an exhilaratingly brief moment last summer, it seemed that Americans were beginning to embrace collectively a concept of anti-racism, seeking to understand how America\u2019s original sin of racial slavery continues to shape our politically divisive present. Suddenly Black history mattered in ways that were vital to our national interest. Business, civic and corporate leaders scrambled to organize webinars that might explain the protests to their employees and leadership teams. The \u201c1619 Project,\u201d a Pulitzer Prize winning multimedia investigation of slavery\u2019s panoramic tentacles in American life over four centuries, took on new political and democratic significance. Families of Emmett Till and George Floyd bond over shared tragedies In this sense, for a brief moment, George Floyd and the protests sparked by his death utterly transformed the partisan and spiritual dimensions of American politics. The field of Democratic Party politics transformed. Black voters flexed their power, helping to elect a groundbreaking vice president in Kamala Harris and remaking the Senate with the election of Georgia senators Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff. The visible strength of Black voters changed the trajectory of the Republican Party too. The GOP\u2019s fealty to Trump\u2019s \u201cBig Lie\u201d about election fraud can be traced back to growing unease regarding the ability of BLM protests to organize and activate a broad multiracial and multigenerational coalition of voters \u2013 let\u2019s call them the George Floyd and Breonna Taylor generation \u2013 to not only defeat the president but to permanently reshape American politics. George Floyd\u2019s death helped to accelerate the evolution of America\u2019s Third Reconstruction. And just like the backlash faced after racial slavery and the challenges endured during the Second Reconstruction (the modern civil rights era) and the first (in the years following the Civil War when Black people got elected to office and started to legislate their own post-slavery new deal before being disenfranchised by Jim Crow), we face continuous assaults on Black voting rights, resistance to telling the truth about American history and political roadblocks to efforts to achieve reparations for the wealth that has been plundered from the African American community. Why I'm not celebrating after the Chauvin verdict Some of the most hopeful aspects of the year since Floyd\u2019s murder are visible in the growing realization of tens of millions of Americans of their own personal and political power. The Biden administration\u2019s focus on racial equity in the passing of the pandemic relief bill, the organization of the Justice Department, executive orders and public pronouncements following the guilty verdict in the Derek Chauvin trial all reflect the power of Black grassroots insurgency in the wake of Floyd\u2019s death. President Joe Biden\u2019s willingness to address racism from the national bully pulpit offers an important exemplar of how our nation might take the lead in centering racial justice in domestic and foreign policy. Democracy remains imperiled so long as Black lives in America are \u2013 as they remain today \u2013 marginalized, segregated and subject to mass incarceration and premature death. The Republican Party has unleashed over 360 voter suppression bills designed to thwart Black votes and suffocate democracy in favor of \u201credeeming\u201d states that voted Democratic in a manner that echoes the Black Codes of yesteryear. The GOP\u2019s efforts to cancel a commission to investigate the White supremacist riot at the capital on January 6 of this year reflect an organized effort to hide from our present historical and political realities.  So much of our national political divide is based upon an inability to squarely confront the ugly parts of American history. UNC's slap at Nikole Hannah-Jones is no isolated incident Witness the desperately partisan efforts to suppress the nation\u2019s complex racial history by banning the teaching of \u201ccritical race theory,\u201d not teaching accurate history in states such as Texas, and denying a Pulitzer Prize winning journalist tenure in the state of North Carolina. America last faced such a moral crossroads in 1968, in the aftermath of Martin Luther King Jr.\u2019s assassination and the widespread urban rebellions that followed. The choice then was between achieving King\u2019s dream to complete Reconstruction\u2019s unfinished business and the \u201claw and order\u201d rhetoric of Richard Nixon, a call to our nation\u2019s worst racial impulses that anticipated Trump\u2019s Big Lie. We know how that ended: Mass incarceration, racial segregation and the politics of backlash won the day. One year after the summer of racial and political reckoning we seem intent on following the same wrong path as previous generations. But if the response to George Floyd\u2019s murder illustrated anything, it is that another world is possible.  We can pass a John R. Lewis Voting Rights Act that honors the legacy of the civil rights generations while ensuring fair ballot access to subsequent ones. Honoring George Floyd\u2019s legacy continues with grassroots efforts to reimagine public safety by investing in non-lethal responders to housing insecurity, mental health challenges and traffic stops. The George Floyd Justice in Policing Act is a major federal effort on this behalf, but the work continues until no Black person is unjustly killed by law enforcement. The political fate of these measures remains uncertain. And yet, America is less of a fixed destination than a constantly evolving ideal, remade by successive generations, most of whom seek love more than perfection. The George Floyd and Breonna Taylor Generation that massed on the streets of America and around the world last year modeled the path we can all still choose to take to move forward, by bearing witness to both the presence of injustice and our collective power to shape a new world.",

He\u2019s the author of the book \u201cLatinx: The New Force in American Politics and Culture.\u201d The views expressed are his own. View more opinion articles on CNN. A quiet story in the entertainment site Deadline that television star Eva Longoria and Black-ish creator Kenya Barris would be developing a new sitcom revolving around a \u201cmodern Latinx family\u201d seemed to set off Texas Sen. Ted Cruz Wednesday. \u201cNo actual Latino uses the woke made-up term Latinx,\u201d he tweeted, reiterating a now familiar conservative talking point. Since it came into widespread use over the last five years or so, Latinx has been attacked by both rightist and leftist critics for different reasons. Using the catchall slur \u201cwoke\u201d allows conservatives to claim that it is an indoctrination tool for liberal ideology, while some progressives feel it obscures the uncomfortable legacy of Latin American colonialism and racism. But the reality of Latinx is not quite as simple as this political debate. It\u2019s often been said that naming is power, whether it comes from an authority or government, or whether it arises from marginalized people that seek to be heard in everyday conversation. When I first heard the term \u201cLatinx\u201d in 2014 to describe Latin American descended people living in the US from students in a seminar I teach at Columbia University, I was compelled to listen. We had spent various parts of the semester discussing the evolution of fairly interchangeable terms like Hispanic, sometimes but not exclusively favored by those with more conservative leanings, and Latino, in turn, its liberal counterpart, to Latino/a and Latina/o, and finally Latin@. Those latter iterations were designed to acknowledge that Spanish is a language whose nouns are designated as male and female, recognizing the \u201cLatino\u201d was a male term that included women as an afterthought, just like \u201cman\u201d once stood for men and women in English. But Latinx was something new, a kind of radical stroke designed to \u201cx\u201d out the notion of gender altogether and in that way recognize nonbinary people, and by extension the LGBTQ community. The origin of Latinx is unclear, though some have traced it to online forums from way back in the mid-1990s, while others point to the use of \u201cx\u201d among Chicana feminist writers like Cherrie Moraga, who wanted to celebrate the use of the letter \u201cx\u201d in Indigenous language. Still, others see in the \u201cx\u201d a reference to those who have been obscured by the legacy of colonialism, the unknown and the marginalized, much the way Malcolm X used it to symbolize his stolen African identity. There is no mistaking the message authorities are sending in Ronald Greene and Andrew Brown cases Since then, the use of the word Latinx to describe US-born people of Latin American descent has stirred continued controversy, but its use appears to be growing. Intended to be a more inclusive term that recognizes nonbinary and LGBTQ people, it symbolizes a new era in ethnic and racial identification in America. According to Google Trends, the interest by web searches in the term Latinx over the last five years has increased significantly, peaking last September (most likely for Hispanic Heritage Month), with an 88% increase in California \u2013 the country\u2019s most Latino populated state. Latinx reflects a desire for younger people to be heard. While a Pew Hispanic study last August showed that only 3% of those surveyed preferred the term, 42% of young people between 18-29 have heard of the term, and 14% of those who are women use it. This probably accounts for why Longoria and Barris opted to use the term in the announcement of the new series spinoff. Still, the term is far from being accepted universally, since it is being attacked from both conservative and progressive sides. Some Hispanics feel the term is an outside imposition of English \u2013 difficult to pronounce in Spanish, laden with American liberal values, while others feel it is an elitist academic term that working people do not care to use. Still others, fueled by a growing awareness of anti-Black and anti-Indigenous tendencies of Latin American cultures, feel that broad terms like Latinx, Latino, and Hispanic, erase their unique identities. The idea that Latinx represents an imposition by US culture on the Spanish language or some notion of Latin American culture seems to lose its credibility when one considers the astonishing array of English words that have come into common use in Spanish-speaking Latin America. There is no outrage when Latin Americans use words like \u201cbrunch,\u201d and \u201chipster\u201d (pronounced heepster) and I still remember hearing residents of Buenos Aires, Argentina, referring to their living rooms as \u201cel living\u201d in the early 2000s. The word Latinx appears to be difficult to pronounce, but no one in my Spanish-dominated family had difficulty with a word like \u201cKleenex\u201d when I was growing up. Maybe it\u2019s the missing e: Some Spanish-speakers prefer to use the term \u201cLatine,\u201d which serves the same function of de-genderizing the term while dispensing with the apparent visceral charge of \u201cx,\u201d which generates an emotional reaction among so many detractors. W. Kamau Bell: Until those in power act right, I'll see you in the streets The fact is that most Latin American descended people in the US become English-dominant by the third generation, often retaining some Spanish, and hybrid terms like \u201cLatinx\u201d break strict language rules as part of an alternative culture that combines elements of both. That \u201cLatinx\u201d does not conform to the rules of Spanish is part of the idea, and is part of what gives it power to represent US Latin American descendants. Young Latinx linguists like Luis Urrieta and Nelson Flores think its use is an example of \u201ctranslanguaging\u201d that \u201cbreaks the rules\u201d and intentionally \u201csignals a political stance.\u201d The objection to the use of any form of \u201cLatino\u201d or \u201cLatin American\u201d because those words represent the legacy of Spanish or continental European colonialism has more validity, particularly in this moment of \u201cracial reckoning.\u201d The unofficial myths of racial democracy used in various Latin American countries employ an embrace of racial mixing that often serve to blunt Black and Indigenous identity and culture in favor of its subservience to European values. The growth of movements demanding recognition of Black and Indigenous people of Latin American descent has led to another term, BIPOC, which refers to Black and Indigenous people of color, bypassing the \u201cLatino\u201d identification and allowing for solidarity with non-Spanish speaking Black and Indigenous people in the Americas. Yet the spread of the use of Latinx, however slow, has been an important step forward since it represents the first time an American ethno-racial group has at least debated with using a term that directly refers to inclusivity of its nonbinary and LGBTQ constituents. Despite arguments that the term is viewed as \u201celitist,\u201d or too quickly employed, particularly in the last presidential election cycle, as something imposed from above, web searches and social media conversations prove there\u2019s an increasing interest.  It seems unlikely that the broader Hispanic-Latino label will disappear, since so much of the governmental apparatus, political strategies, and media marketing is dependent on it. But then there is the matter of how the rhetoric of hate does not seem to distinguish between the variations of Latin American descended people. The recent spate of attacks on Asian Americans fueled by Donald Trump blaming the Covid-19 pandemic on China and his constant name-calling has not spared non-Chinese Asians, with the latest high-profile incident in New York involving an immigrant from the Philippines. Latinos are often grouped together as targets of discrimination as well, often having their citizenship status questioned because of their appearance or Spanish-accented use of English. There is a need for solidarity among people of Latin American descent despite our many racial, ethnic, linguistic, and religious differences. Yet at the same time, we don\u2019t want to lose what makes us special by being Mexican, Puerto Rican, Dominican, Colombian, Salvadoran, Guatemalan, Black, Indigenous, women, or queer. Latinx might do the trick, but it serves everyone to remember the evolutionary journey from colored and Negro to Afro- and African American, and even \u201cBlack.\u201d No matter how many changes and variations, what these times show is that the power to name should be reserved to those who history has long ignored.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Sign up to get our new weekly column as a newsletter. We\u2019re looking back at the strongest, smartest opinion takes of the week from CNN and other outlets. When the history of Covid-19 is written, masks will get their own, long chapter. In the early days of the pandemic, American public health experts warned people against wearing them. Officials weren\u2019t sure how easily the coronavirus spread between people and were concerned that widespread mask-wearing would deplete the scarce protective equipment front-line health workers needed. Weeks later, the scientists reversed course and advocated that everyone wear masks, a recommendation that helped slow the spread of the virus, but was politicized when prominent Republicans, including former President Donald Trump, cast doubt on how well they worked. Now there is an even better safeguard against the disease \u2013 safe and effective vaccines. On Thursday, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention surprised many with a sweeping announcement: it\u2019s OK for fully vaccinated people to take off their masks in most settings. (People whose immune systems are compromised should check with their doctors first, the agency said.) \u201cIt\u2019s happening. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has liberated Americans who are fully vaccinated against Covid-19 from our masks. Indoors and out, in most situations, we can finally roam face-out again,\u201d exulted SE Cupp. \u201cAfter a year of stuffy-face condensation, fogged-up glasses, smeared lipstick, \u2018mascne,\u2019 and \u2018I can\u2019t tell who that is\u2019 polite nodding, won\u2019t it be spectacular to feel the sun on our cheeks and the wind on our teeth?\u201d Changing the guidance is one thing. Getting people who have spent a year wearing face-coverings to adapt to the new rules \u2013 which still require masks in transportation and health care settings \u2013 is another.  And there\u2019s no outward way to tell who has been vaccinated and who has not. David Holtgrave, dean of the University at Albany School of Public Health, and epidemiologist Eli Rosenberg are among those raising questions about the CDC\u2019s unmasking guidance. The vaccines in the US \u201chave outstanding effectiveness and should be fully utilized,\u201d they wrote. \u201cUnfortunately, we are still not across the finish line with Covid in the US. There is still a Covid death about every 2.5 minutes in the nation, and serious racial and ethnic disparities \u2026 A central mistake in public health is easing up infectious disease control efforts just before crossing the finish line. Unfortunately, and we suspect inadvertently, that is what the CDC did on Thursday.\u201d The CDC\u2019s encouragement for vaccinated people to drop their masks may act as an incentive for more people to get the shot, though the agency said that wasn\u2019t the reason for the change \u2013 it cited scientific studies showing the effectiveness of the vaccines. The change came as governments and businesses have unveiled a range of more tangible inducements, from free doughnuts and drinks to time off and cash bonuses. The ultimate example arrived this week when the state of Ohio announced it would award a million dollars each week for five weeks to the  winners of a special lottery-style drawing if they\u2019re vaccinated. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t have to bribe\u201d people to get vaccinated, wrote David M. Perry\u2026but it might help. \u201cFrom doughnuts to marijuana, beer to cash, private and public entities have been appropriately creative when it comes to persuading people about vaccines. But all of those are carrots. We also need a stick.\u201d He added, \u201cWhile people can do what they want with their own bodies, that doesn\u2019t include the right to carry a deadly disease into public spaces. The way to get people vaccinated should be simply to require vaccination or documented medical exemption in order to return to schools, businesses, and crowded public spaces.\u201d Keeping our guard up against a sudden spike in the pandemic is crucial, wrote Jeffrey D. Sachs: \u201cFor the public, there is one overarching message: get vaccinated. The lies of the anti-vax community are disgusting and must be countered.\u201d School buildings should all be reopened now, wrote US Secretary of Education Miguel A. Cardona. \u201cAnything less than 100% of students being offered the option to return to in-person learning full-time is not enough,\u201d he pointed out. \u201cWe must continue to lead with the same urgency as the President to put every resource to bear to reopen more schools this spring. Waiting until the fall is too late. Because when it comes to helping students succeed, we don\u2019t have a moment to spare.\u201d On the surface, Donald Trump\u2019s sway over the Republican Party, demonstrated this week by the ouster of his critic Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney from the House party leadership, doesn\u2019t make historical sense. He is a defeated one-term president, on a par with Herbert Hoover and Jimmy Carter, whose records were seen by their contemporaries as examples of how not to govern successfully. \u201cThe biggest challenge that one-term presidents have faced with their party is that after losing, they are seen as losers,\u201d wrote historian Julian Zelizer. \u201cParty leaders don\u2019t want to invest in their future and often conclude that their record explained the outcome. Not with Trump.\u201d The reason: he promoted the lie that the election was stolen from him and \u201ca majority of Republicans bought the lie.\u201d \u201cTrump is in perfect sync with the modern Republican Party,\u201d wrote Zelizer, who noted that it \u201chas shifted to the extremes \u2013 both in terms of policy and in its partisan tactics. Though considered anti-establishment in 2016, Trump, it turns out, fit the GOP like a glove\u2026Most in the party are unlikely to be swayed by Cheney\u2019s remarks to Congress that the election is over and \u2018our freedom lasts only if we protect it.\u2019\u201d As Frida Ghitis observed, \u201cThis week showed us two diverging paths in America.\u201d The growing number of vaccinated Americans and the easing of mask guidance showed that \u201clife is now moving much closer to normal.\u201d But recent days have \u201calso confirmed that the political insanity that gripped the United States during the past administration has entered the bloodstream of the Republican Party. Watching the GOP \u2013 now home to Reps. Matt Gaetz of Florida, Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia and other, shall we say, \u2018unique\u2019 personalities \u2013 we re-experienced that sense of disbelief that was our daily fare over the past few years.\u201d At the same time, a new survey made clear where most Americans are politically. In the Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research poll, 63% approved of the job President Joe Biden is doing and 71% gave him high marks for his handling of the pandemic, including 47% of Republicans, Jill Filipovic noted.  \u201cHe may not be getting accolades on Fox News, but average Americans can look around and see that things are a lot better than they were just a few months ago. Vaccination rates have soared. Hospitalizations are way down,\u201d Filipovic wrote. The most encouraging part? \u201cIt\u2019s still possible for a president to handle a crisis well and see his efforts recognized, even from those on the other side of the political fence who are being fed a steady stream of outrage and misinformation.\u201d For more on politics: Elie Honig: What has come out against Gaetz paints a bleak picture Jennifer Rodgers: \u2018Foxitis\u2019 defendant may do some good Allie Young: We saddled up to make sure Native Americans got to vote Michael D\u2019Antonio: GOP tried to hide bad news about Trump\u2019s popularity Nafees Hamid: How to talk to insurrectionists and conspiracy theorists Charlie Dent: Trump is the root of why GOP will sacrifice Cheney for Stefanik Lanhee J. Chen: The one good line of attack Caitlyn Jenner and others have against Gavin Newsom Jocelyn Benson: The battle for American democracy has just begun On May 7, a ransomware attack led operators to shut down a 5,500-mile pipeline that carries fuel from Texas through the south and up the East Coast. Fearing a gas shortage, drivers rushed to fill their tanks, and in some states service stations ran out of fuel. Four days later, engineers inspecting a heavily used bridge in Memphis, Tennessee discovered a crack that forced them to close a six-lane artery that carries 45,000 vehicles a day over the Mississippi River. Hundreds of barges were stranded when authorities halted traffic on the river. In the best of times, systems that enable travel and the rest of our complicated lives hum along so smoothly that we imagine we can always rely on them. But at these moments, they take on the ephemeral quality Prospero describes in Shakespeare\u2019s \u201cTempest\u201d \u2013 the actors \u201cwere all spirits and are melted into air, into thin air\u2026the cloud-capp\u2019d towers, the gorgeous palaces, the solemn temples, the great globe itself \u2026 shall dissolve,\u201d leaving nothing behind. Of course, when vital systems break down, panic sets in. A nation that was hoarding toilet paper a year ago began to scramble for gasoline, Meg Jacobs wrote. \u201cNothing seems to scare Americans more than the fear of running out of gas.\u201d \u201cAt one level, Americans love their cars \u2013 they are a sign of freedom and the open road,\u201d Jacobs wrote. \u201cAt another, we created a suburban landscape that depends on driving everywhere. Americans drive more miles and do so alone more than citizens of any other country.\u201d She noted: \u201cWe\u2019ve seen this dance before. If you are of a certain age, you surely recall sitting in the back of your family\u2019s station wagon (with no seatbelts of course) waiting hours on end in the 1970s to get a gallon of gas.\u201d Colonial Pipeline, the target of the ransomware attack, was reported to have paid an unknown amount of ransom money to its attackers, identified as DarkSide. Such attacks have gone on for years, noted Arun Vishwanath, and are taking a heavy toll. \u201cIn 2020, nearly 2,400 local governments, health care facilities and schools were victims of ransomware. The average downtime because of it was 21 days, with an average payment of $312,493 \u2013 a 171% increase over 2019, according to an analysis by the Institute for Security and Technology. We cannot afford this.\u201d New technology hasn\u2019t solved the problem, Vishwanath wrote, because it doesn\u2019t sufficiently address the vulnerability of users. Attackers gain access to computer networks by \u201cusing spear phishing that deceives users into clicking on a malicious hyperlink or attachment.\u201d Companies need to do a better job of evaluating and training workers to beware of cyber risks, he argued. The week\u2019s infrastructure troubles coincided with bipartisan meetings over Biden\u2019s spending and taxing plans. \u201cRepublicans and Democrats can find the money to pay for the infrastructure to rebuild America if the political courage exists,\u201d wrote Aaron Klein, who served in the Treasury during the Obama administration. \u201cThe easy part is coming up with a plan for investing in American infrastructure. Done properly, infrastructure makes our lives better, creates quality jobs and fosters prosperity. The trick is how to pay for it.\u201d Republicans who have taken a \u201cno new taxes\u201d pledge are balking at Biden\u2019s proposal to raise corporate taxes. The sudden outbreak of violence in the Middle East has killed more than 100 people. It came at a time when the future of political leadership in Israel and of the Palestinian Authority is in question, and with a new US administration focused on domestic issues rather than thorny international ones. Aaron David Miller and Daniel Kurtzer, who, as American diplomats, long wrestled with the conflict, wrote, \u201cThere is time, even as the situation deteriorates, to change the recurring cycles of pain and war that lead nowhere but to more of each. Everyone must act, not just issue statements \u2013 the Biden administration, Arabs, Europeans and, most of all, Israelis and Palestinians. Indeed, without Israeli and Palestinian buy-in, no amount of external pressure or inducement will end what promises to be an endless conflict.\u201d As David A. Andelman noted, it was only last year that \u201cformer President Donald Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu unveiled their peace plan for Israelis and Palestinians at the White House\u2026\u201d At first, the plan negotiated by Trump\u2019s son-in-law and senior adviser Jared Kushner \u201cseemed like a colossal success. Though Palestinian representatives rejected the entire plan from the outset and refused to be involved in any aspect of its creation, two of Israel\u2019s longest-standing foes in the region, Bahrain and the United Arab Emirates, followed by Morocco and Sudan, reversed generations of hostility, opened diplomatic relations and eventually allowed commercial air flights.\u201d But now, Andelman noted, \u201cthe question that begs to be asked is whether that plan has worked at all.\u201d One hundred years ago this month, Rebecca Brown Crutcher fled the Greenwood community in Tulsa, Oklahoma, \u201cin fear of her life as White Tulsans burned her neighborhood to the ground,\u201d wrote her great-granddaughter, Tiffany Crutcher. \u201cOn May 31 and June 1, 1921, White gangs flooded into the thriving Greenwood neighborhood and murdered up to 300 Black men, women and children.\u201d The attackers burned 1,500 homes, leaving 10,000 Black residents homeless; they destroyed more than 600 \u201cbusinesses, and places of worship, healing, learning and gathering.\u201d To compound the crime, \u201cto this day, not one person has ever been held accountable and not a single cent of reparations has been paid to the survivors or the victims\u2019 descendants,\u201d Crutcher wrote. She criticized Oklahoma Governor Kevin Stitt for signing laws that immunize drivers who kill or injure protesters \u201cunintentionally\u201d and that prohibit Oklahoma schools from teaching critical race theory. \u201cMy hope is that our teachers will look this evil in the eye and refuse to give in or back down. I hope they will continue teaching the truth about topics like the 1921 Tulsa Race Massacre \u2013 including that it was born from White supremacy, a mortal threat to our democracy that remains with us today.\u201d David Axelrod: I\u2019m sharing my father\u2019s story to help end a stigma Ren\u00e9 Marsh: This Mother\u2019s Day, join the fight against pediatric cancer Nicole Hemmer: The drama in Stacey Abrams\u2019 political thriller is unfolding off the page Katie Mack: The game-changing innovation on Mars Dean Obeidallah: Elon Musk\u2019s big mistake on \u2018SNL\u2019 Peniel E.

John Goodrich, chief scientist for Panthera, the global wild cat conservation organization, survived a mauling by a wild tiger. So he knows the danger of keeping big cats in private hands. \u201cA frightened tiger is just as likely to attack as run away and a scared cat that weighs a few hundred pounds is no small threat,\u201d Goodrich warned. \u201cThere is no doubt that a thinly regulated patchwork of laws governing private ownership and exploitation of tigers in the United States has created a public safety, animal welfare, and law enforcement nightmare.\u201d There are only about 3,900 tigers left in the wild, a tiny fraction of the number a century ago, Goodrich wrote. \u201cBy some estimates, there are twice that many in captivity in the US. Tigers belong in forests, savannas, and mangrove swamps, not in backyards, not in selfies, and certainly not in a Houston neighborhood.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Sign up to get our new weekly column as a newsletter. We\u2019re looking back at the strongest, smartest opinion takes of the week from CNN and other outlets. Donald Trump saw it coming. Back in 2019, the moderate Joe Biden looked like a candidate uniquely suited to threaten his re-election as president. In a July 25 phone call, Trump asked Ukraine\u2019s president Volodymyr Zelensky to have his government work with his lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, and with then-US Attorney General William Barr to launch an investigation of Biden and his son Hunter. That call, which Trump defended as \u201cperfect,\u201d and the administration\u2019s pausing of security aid to Ukraine, would become the focus of his first impeachment, which ended with Trump\u2019s acquittal in the Senate. The former president never could solve the riddle of how to defeat Biden, who he accused of being a puppet for the \u201cradical left.\u201d In reality, Trump lost to him because the coronavirus pandemic changed everything \u2014 but only some people got the message. One of them was Biden. In a speech to a joint session of Congress Wednesday, with a soft-spoken, almost whispered urgency, President Biden made his case for a breathtaking overhaul of America\u2019s social contract. The President\u2019s argument, in just his first 100 days, for $6 trillion in new spending would have been unthinkable before the coronavirus, which has killed more than half a million Americans and sickened 30 million others. When the pandemic hit, suddenly a nation skeptical of government began looking to Washington for help. Trump and Congress initially reacted by approving a series of Covid-19 relief packages, but Senate Republicans ultimately balked at the Democrats\u2019 $3-trillion HEROES Act. Biden is aiming much higher. His \u201cambition is extraordinary,\u201d wrote Frida Ghitis. \u201cHis laundry list of initiatives and plans is enough to fill many presidencies. Biden is right when he views this presidency not only as a vehicle for improving the lives of Americans, but for showing the world the superiority of democracy over autocracy.\u201d The image of two women \u2014 Vice President Kamala Harris and Speaker Nancy Pelosi\u2014behind a US President at a joint session for the first time, Ghitis wrote, along with Biden\u2019s words, \u201cwere a reminder of how far we\u2019ve come, how awful things were, and how far we still have to go.\u201d Biden is \u201cdeveloping a positive kind of populism,\u201d wrote Van Jones. \u201cWhen Biden was elected, a lot of people \u2013 particularly progressives \u2013 underestimated him. After Wednesday night, it became clear Biden isn\u2019t holding anything back. He recognizes this is a once-in-a-century opportunity to reset the American system, and he\u2019s not going to let this chance go to waste.\u201d The initiatives that Trump could once parody as \u201cradical left\u201d are much more in the American mainstream now, with polls showing many as broadly popular \u2013 even though Biden\u2019s 53% approval rating is on the low side compared with other presidents (aside from Trump) at this point in their terms.  \u201cThe best thing about President Joe Biden is that he\u2019s old,\u201d wrote historian Meg Jacobs. \u201cHe can remember a time before \u2013 and not just before the rightward swing of former President Donald Trump or even the centrism of former Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama. He remembers a time before small-government proponent former President Ronald Reagan, when Democrats stood before the country and said unabashedly that a big and bold government was exactly what the country needed.\u201d That\u2019s precisely what alarms conservatives like Scott Jennings, who wrote, \u201cBiden gave away the progressive game when he said he would \u2018turn crisis into opportunity.\u2019 His $1.9 trillion Covid bill spent excessively on liberal social programs, and Biden is doing it again in an infrastructure bill that spends just 5% of its $2.25 trillion on roads, bridges, waterways, ports, and airports. Name your crisis\u2026and Biden is prepared to ride it like a Kentucky Derby jockey towards a liberal finish line of exploding debt and higher taxes.\u201d In Lanhee J. Chen\u2019s view, Biden \u201ccould have used his considerable power \u2013 both via the bully pulpit but also with his partisans in Congress \u2013 to send a message that compromise isn\u2019t a dirty word. This was the theory he advanced during his campaign for president. But the reality of his first 100 days in office has been something entirely different.\u201d Trump left Biden an \u201cunholy mess,\u201d wrote David Axelrod, that included \u201ca raging virus and resultant economic downturn, a fraught politics, a decayed bureaucracy and a bitterly divided Washington, DC.\u201d And while Biden has coped with those challenges, \u201cthe genius of Biden\u2019s first 100 days is his style. Even as he rammed the $1.9 trillion relief plan through a closely divided Congress on a partisan basis \u2013 and even as he is pushing for more \u2013 he has struck a decidedly nonconfrontational tone. He does not demand constant attention. He does not vilify his opponents or pick fights for sport. He is low-key, warm and empathetic.\u201d Biden \u201chas publicly called for the end of systemic racism in American society,\u201d Peniel E. Joseph noted. The challenge is to \u201cturn his words into tangible policy deeds\u2026 But if the first president in American history to explicitly call out \u2018White supremacy\u2019 in an inaugural speech has shown the nation anything, that\u2019s to never bet against Joe Biden.\u201d South Carolina\u2019s Tim Scott, the only Black member of the Senate Republicans, gave his party\u2019s response to Biden\u2019s speech, stressing his view that \u201cAmerica is not a racist country.\u201d Clay Cane pointed out that \u201cit wasn\u2019t an actual rebuttal to Biden\u2019s remarks. Biden never said America was a racist country. Scott created a straw man talking point for his party\u2019s base so he could tell them what they wanted to hear. He was joyfully playing the role of the Black man who makes White Americans more comfortable.\u201d The Ukraine scandal resurfaced this week when FBI agents executed a search warrant at Rudy Giuliani\u2019s home. Legal analyst Jennifer Rodgers saw that as an indication the \u201cinvestigation is ramping up in a big way.\u201d Citing reporting by the New York Times, Rodgers wrote that investigators are looking into whether \u201cwhile he was working on Trump\u2019s behalf to get Ukrainian officials to announce a criminal investigation into the Bidens, Giuliani was also lobbying US officials about matters of interest to Ukrainians with whom Giuliani was working, like the removal of then-US Ambassador to Ukraine Marie Yovanovitch.\u201d For more on politics: Elie Honig: We can\u2019t let January 6 become a distant, distorted memory Aaron David Miller: The main idea behind Biden\u2019s global strategy Lincoln Mitchell: The census is a lucky break for Republicans Michael D\u2019Antonio: Donald Trump set a really low bar for Joe Biden\u2019s speech to Congress Joe Rogan told his huge podcast audience, \u201cif you\u2019re like 21 years old, and you say to me, should I get vaccinated? I\u2019ll go no.\u201d Dr. Jonathan Reiner questioned Rogan\u2019s assessment. Yes, most young people would survive a case of Covid, but it has already killed 2,374 Americans under 30, Reiner noted. And it \u201cdoesn\u2019t have to kill you to wreck your life\u2026more than 10% of health care workers recovering from relatively mild Covid-19 infections were still experiencing significant symptoms, such as loss of taste or smell, fatigue and breathing problems, eight months later.\u201d Even more importantly, adults between 20 and 49 accounted for about 70% of the disease\u2019s spread last year. \u201cThe reservoir for this virus in the United States is young, unvaccinated Americans.\u201d Historically, young people tend to have \u201cpoor vaccination rates,\u201d according to Matt Alexander and Jesper Ke, who are Gen-Zers and medical students. \u201cAs vaccine supply catches up with demand, the nation\u2019s attention has centered on how to reach out to key vaccine holdouts like racial and ethnic minorities or White, evangelical Christians. However, it\u2019s important that we don\u2019t overlook Gen Z adults, who make up a sizable proportion of the movable middle. Throughout the pandemic, we\u2019ve neglected to speak their language, include them in stimulus bills, and failed to adequately address its impact on their mental health.\u201d The CDC this week loosened its mask-wearing guidance for vaccinated people in outdoor settings but some experts argue it should do more to stress the benefits of getting a vaccine, particularly for the benefit of those who are hesitant. \u201cWe need a hard right turn on the narrative about vaccines,\u201d wrote Dr. Lucy McBride. \u201cPeople need incentives to take one. We must empower people with facts about vaccine efficacy and shift the media\u2019s bad news bias to one of evidence-based optimism about post-vaccination life. We need visible public confidence in the vaccines\u2019 stunning efficacy and trusted messengers to deliver nuanced advice to vaccine-hesitant folks. Patients are motivated to get vaccinated when they realize that after vaccination they can liberalize their behaviors, see other vaccinated \u2014 and most unvaccinated \u2014 people without restrictions or fear, and unmask when appropriate.\u201d India reported more than 400,000 new Covid-19 infections and 3,500 deaths Saturday. Crematorium workers are struggling to keep up with the shocking number of new deaths, CNN reported. \u201cAs images of mass-cremation sites, overcrowded hospitals, and people gasping for air continue to overwhelm our social media feeds and news, one thing became apparent: People are on their own like never before,\u201d wrote Akanksha Singh, an Indian journalist. \u201cThe lack of resources and personnel is palpable on social media. Desperate cries for medication and oxygen tanks abound on Twitter and Instagram, where posts read, \u2018In need of ICU bed\u2019 or \u2018Plasma urgently required for treatment of Covid patient in Max Hospital, Delhi.\u2019\u201d A journalist who live-tweeted about his symptoms \u201cdied while waiting for help.\u201d Prime Minister Narendra Modi\u2019s BJP party once promoted the image of \u201cIndia shining\u201d to signal its transformation from a backward, developing nation into a global economic powerhouse, wrote Meenakshi Narula Ahamed. But the pandemic \u201chas revived images of India as a country of disease and death. With its health care system collapsing under the strain, for the first time in 15 years, the government is once again in the awkward position of asking for foreign assistance, despite the country being a vaccine manufacturing hub. Many blame the Modi government for this self-inflicted crisis.\u201d Republican members of Congress and voices in right-wing media concocted a story that Biden wants to limit Americans to eating no more than four pounds of beef a year. Rest easy, wrote Jill Filipovic: \u201cJoe Biden isn\u2019t going to take away your hamburgers.\u201d The false claim is part of a pattern, she noted. Conservative politicians realize that their views on policy \u201care increasingly radical and unpopular. To distract from what they actually stand for, they latch onto a series of often make-believe culture war claims that have no bearing on leadership and legislation, from \u2018cancel culture\u2019 to \u2018wokeness\u2019 to, now, red meat.\u201d Indeed we live in the world of pants-on-fire lies, wrote Nicole Hemmer. It creates a predicament for journalists. The lie that Barack Obama was born outside the US and thus ineligible to be president was spread eagerly by conservatives, aided by Donald Trump. Mainstream media fact checks debunked it, but didn\u2019t dent the conspiracy theory, \u201cwhich actually grew in popularity during Obama\u2019s second term in office. The case of birtherism shows that debunking a lie, unless handled very carefully, doesn\u2019t work. Exposing a lie for the falsehood it is can actually spread misinformation further by repeating the false claims. So the more journalists try to do their work \u2013 the work of exposure \u2013 the worse the situation gets.\u201d After the video of George Floyd\u2019s killing surfaced nearly a year ago, CNN\u2019s Fredricka Whitfield sat \u201con the stairs leading to my 16-year-old son\u2019s bedroom as he slept, with my face in my hands. I cried for George Floyd and too many others who have been senselessly killed.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m sick with worry,\u201d Whitfield wrote. \u201cI\u2019m tired because I can\u2019t sleep, worrying about my two sons and daughter \u2013 and other sons and daughters like mine. \u201cThis comes at a time when I\u2019m supposed to be over the moon about the milestones ahead for my 16-year-old son, who is nearing the end of his sophomore year in high school, starting his first job in a few weeks and looking forward to trading in his driver\u2019s permit for a permanent driver\u2019s license in a few months.\u201d Sonia Pruitt is a retired police captain who teaches criminal justice and founded The Black Police Experience. She called out authorities in North Carolina, who have yet to release police body-cam footage that could shed light on the killing of Andrew Brown, Jr. in Elizabeth City, North Carolina. \u201cThe decision not to immediately release the full body camera video was offensive to the family, the Black community and anyone who is exhausted from the repeated deaths of Black men and women at the hands of law enforcement,\u201d she wrote.

Nina Trieu Tarnay was 6 years old when her family joined the exodus from Vietnam by boat. \u201cOut on the water, the smell of diesel mixed with the ocean salt, the sound of the engine puttering along was slightly louder than my mom\u2019s muffled cries,\u201d she wrote. \u201cI recall being terrified and wanting to cry, but knowing I shouldn\u2019t, I clenched my teeth and fought the urge.\u201d The next morning, she woke up seasick and then realized, \u201cMy little brother and grandmother were on another side of the world, behind us. We were in the middle of the ocean, drowning \u2013 at times \u2013 in my mom\u2019s tears.\u201d Read and watch her story of the journey from being a refugee to an American. Peniel E.

She is a Republican who identifies as transgender, noted Allison Hope. \u201cJenner supported Trump before publicly denouncing him. And Republicans\u2019 legislative attacks on the transgender community have grown disgustingly pointed. So progressives who are worried about the effects of Jenner\u2019s run have a point.\u201d Yet Hope argued that Jenner deserves a chance. \u201cJenner\u2019s political stature could project national visibility, further normalizing trans people in positions of power in government. She would be the highest-ranking trans person in US history, adding to an emerging trend of heightened trans representation in government\u2026\u201d As Lauren A. Wright noted, Jenner is not alone among celebrities in seeking political office. Dwayne \u201cThe Rock\u201d Johnson and Herschel Walker are considering candidacies. And America\u2019s still processing the presidency of Donald Trump, a reality TV star. Don\u2019t underestimate celebrities\u2019 chances, Wright cautioned. \u201cCelebrity candidates are armed with attributes that often make them uniquely gifted campaigners \u2013 and singularly bad government representatives. \u201cFor the most part, they lack the relevant experience and skills needed to successfully navigate government institutions and strike bipartisan compromises\u2026they tend to surround themselves with stalwarts and sycophants, amateurs who have neither incentive nor knowledge to work through the arduous and unglamorous work of legislating.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Peniel E. Joseph is the Barbara Jordan chair in ethics and political values and the founding director of the Center for the Study of Race and Democracy at the LBJ School of Public Affairs at the University of Texas at Austin, where he is also a professor of history. He is the author of several books, most recently, \u201cThe Sword and the Shield: The Revolutionary Lives of Malcolm X and Martin Luther King Jr.\u201d The views expressed here are his own. View more opinion articles on CNN. On Tuesday, the world let out a sigh of relief when former officer Derek Chauvin was found guilty of murdering George Floyd nearly a year ago. It seemed like everyone was waiting with clenched jaws, holding their breath as they questioned if the US justice system was going to prove, once again, unable to recognize and protect the sanctity of Black life. But the moment of relief would be fleeting as news broke that an Ohio officer had fatally shot Ma\u2019Khia Bryant, a Black teenager, about 30 minutes before the verdict was delivered in Chauvin\u2019s trial. Details of the Ohio shooting are still emerging. According to police officials and bodycam footage shared with the public, the teenager was holding a knife and charged two other females. But many are openly questioning why this young teenager could not have been subdued with nonlethal force. Both cases keep at the forefront the conversation of how police officers routinely fail to deescalate a situation when it comes to interactions with Black and brown communities. The incident in Ohio serves as a reminder that the verdict in Minneapolis was only a small victory in a very large battle to transform the role, purpose and impact of law enforcement in Black America. It seems that local and state governments care more about property, building and money than people of color. We need only to point to the outpouring of state and local resources to prevent violence in the event that Chauvin was acquitted. Imagine if the same level of care that Minneapolis officials and law enforcement agencies took in turning the Twin Cities into a military encampment had been directed toward investing in Black communities? Why I'm not celebrating after the Chauvin verdict If Minneapolis \u2013 but really the whole country \u2013 redirected its resources toward properly training officers (and holding them accountable when they are in the wrong) so that people who looked like Philando Castile, George Floyd and Daunte Wright wouldn\u2019t have to worry, they would not have to spend millions of dollars in an effort to uphold peace without justice. Congresswoman Maxine Waters, in a show of solidarity with grassroots activists, said as much when she urged protesters to embrace the politics of confrontation if the jury returned with a not guilty verdict. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to stay on the street and demand justice,\u201d explained the California member of the House who is known as a fierce and formidable social justice advocate. Critics reacting to Waters\u2019 support of street demonstrations for Black citizenship and dignity have willfully reinterpreted her words as advocating violence. The same members of the GOP who walked back their criticism against former President Donald Trump\u2019s role in inciting insurrection and spreading lies about election fraud are now pillorying Waters. The criticism against her bumps into a long and uncomfortable history of trying to silence, censor and harass outspoken Black women civil rights activists. Voting rights activist Fannie Lou Hamer faced death threats, physical violence from law enforcement and unspeakable forms of harassment during the 1960s and 1970s. Brooklyn Congresswoman Shirley Chisholm turned a longshot 1972 candidacy for the Democratic Party\u2019s presidential nomination into a generational defining run for political dignity and personal respect, bravely withstanding criticism that attacked her as unqualified because of race and gender. In our own time, Stacey Abrams, a former Georgia gubernatorial candidate and state legislator who helped successfully organize a voter registration drive that enabled Democrats to recapture the Senate, received unwarranted criticism when she suggested then-presidential candidate Joe Biden should choose a Black woman as his running mate, a position she was eminently qualified for. Kamala Harris, the first Black and Asian woman vice president of the United States, has faced a heightened level of scorn and ridicule. Black women are the most reliable Democratic voters in America and are, with the election of Harris and the power broking of Abrams, beginning to receive their just rewards on a national level. Congresswoman Waters, who represents a district that includes South Central Los Angeles, is a long marcher in the struggle for Black freedom, one who, as my Black church folk are fond of saying, \u201ccame early and stayed late.\u201d Rep. Waters\u2019 statement did not call for violence. It merely acknowledged one aspect of American history that many wish to ignore. Conventional politics, such as voting, lobbying and crafting legislation, while important and necessary, are incomplete without the application of political pressure. Black folks whose families are under siege by law enforcement, face structural violence, high rates of unemployment and illness and live in racially segregated neighborhoods do not have lobbyists. They express their displeasure in the streets.  Last year\u2019s George Floyd protests, which proved to be the largest social justice movement in American history, amplifies this point. Before more than 15 million Americans took to the streets to demand change, efforts to abolish prison, end punishment and reimagine public safety were nowhere on the national political agenda. Since then, we have had a robust debate on \u201cdefunding the police,\u201d educated the nation on the pitfalls of \u201cqualified immunity\u201d for police officers and challenged the stranglehold that police unions have in preventing the systemic change required to fix these problems. In the meantime, Black people continue to be shot, to be brutalized and to die at the hands of the police.  Rep. Maxine Waters\u2019 supposed words of fire are, in reality, an observation of the necessity to continue the fight for racial justice. She calls upon this nation to devote resources, energy and innovation to protecting Black lives in Minneapolis and across the country.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Sign up to get our new weekly column as a newsletter. We\u2019re looking back at the strongest, smartest opinion takes of the week from CNN and other outlets. When losing soldiers flee a battlefield \u2013 or people migrate in search of a better life \u2013 they are voting with their feet. \u201cFoot voting\u201d lets people control their own destiny, law professor Ilya Somin argues. In America today, people are also voting with their arms, rolling up their sleeves to get vaccinated against Covid-19 \u2013 and the impact will likely be momentous. Nearly 70% of Americans are \u201carm voting\u201d \u2013 they either expect to be vaccinated or already have been, according to Pew Research\u2019s polling. By contrast, in November, voter turnout soared \u2013 but still only about 62% of voting-age people cast ballots in the Biden-Trump contest. More than 114 million Americans have gotten at least one dose of a vaccine. By getting a vaccination, Americans are voting for science and a return to normal life. They\u2019re participating in a huge public health effort, taking into their bloodstream vaccines that were developed and proven to be safe years faster than most. Still, the nation\u2019s ability to fully recover from Covid-19 may depend on how many of the hesitant 30% will step up. \u201cWith more and more vaccination, the likelihood that a non-immune person will come in contact with an infected person is progressively reduced until \u2013 poof \u2013 the risk of catching the infection is almost gone (though never zero),\u201d wrote Dr. Kent Sepkowitz, an infectious disease expert. The goal is \u201cherd immunity\u201d but pinning down the level of vaccination needed to get there is difficult, Sepkowitz pointed out. \u201cThings vary community to community. For example, in one locality, people may move around a lot \u2013 by car or bus or by walking. Each has an impact on risk of transmission (and therefore the number of immune people needed to protect the rest of the \u2018herd\u2019).\u201d The weather, social customs and the transmissibility of individual virus variants all play a role. \u201cSetting ourselves up for a giant belly flop by forcing public health leaders to produce a magic number will \u2026 further undermine people\u2019s faith in science, thereby slowing our emergence from the long shadow of Covid-19.\u201d While deaths are declining in the US, Covid cases and hospitalizations have plateaued at a high level. \u201cWhen the pandemic began more than a year ago, the elderly were most vulnerable, and the early months saw the coronavirus race through an older generation, with tragic consequences,\u201d The Washington Post\u2019s editorial board observed. \u201cNow, three-fourths of the U.S. population 65 and older has received at least one dose of vaccine, and the tide of infection is turning toward younger people. They should not be complacent about the dangers.\u201d Coming out of the pandemic safely will be a tricky adjustment for many. Masks are still the gold standard for preventing the disease\u2019s spread. \u201cWalking around my Brooklyn neighborhood as the country comes out of a long, Covid-depressed winter, I notice nearly everyone engaging in a curious pandemic ritual: as we stroll past brownstones, we all pull our masks up as soon as we see one another coming,\u201d wrote Jill Filipovic. \u201cWe are shifting toward a new normal, and that will be rocky \u2013 our social skills are rusty and our anxieties high. Simply being near strangers pitches many of us into hypervigilance. And we want to demonstrate that we are doing our part to protect our communities.\u201d When mass shootings happen, as they did this week in South Carolina and Texas, they draw media coverage \u201cfor a few days,\u201d noted Nicole Hockley. \u201cThere are news stories, sadness, and anger that underlie an outcry for change \u2026 but then we move on. And I was just as guilty as anyone else,\u201d she wrote. But then her six-year-old son Dylan \u201cwas killed in his first-grade classroom along with 19 of his classmates and six educators at Sandy Hook Elementary school. My beautiful butterfly who brought so much joy and love to my life was gone. I felt like my heart was ripped from my chest. Nobody should have to feel the pain of losing their child to gun violence. It\u2019s a pain that never goes away.\u201d President Joe Biden announced Thursday six executive actions to attack the gun violence problem, but Hockley said that\u2019s not enough. \u201cAmericans need Congress to vote on common-sense gun reform, to achieve things like universal background checks and stopping the sale of assault weapons. Voters need to hold lawmakers accountable.\u201d The US Constitution\u2019s Second Amendment was never intended to create an individual right to a gun, wrote historian Dominic Erdozain. \u201cMass shootings would not have surprised the founders. A government that tolerates them would.\u201d James Madison and the other drafters of the Constitution \u201cdid not equate freedom with firepower but with life. With 43,543 lives lost to firearms in a single year \u2013 of which 24,156 were suicides \u2013 is it time to acknowledge that they were right?\u201d The Senate parliamentarian is signaling that Biden\u2019s $2 trillion infrastructure plan could sail through that chamber without a single Republican vote. Yet the senior senator from West Virginia whose vote would be crucial to that effort doesn\u2019t think it\u2019s a good idea. In a Washington Post op-ed, Joe Manchin warned, \u201cIf the filibuster is eliminated or budget reconciliation becomes the norm, a new and dangerous precedent will be set to pass sweeping, partisan legislation that changes the direction of our nation every time there is a change in political control. The consequences will be profound \u2013 our nation may never see stable governing again.\u201d  Biden can\u2019t accept that view if his party is to succeed in future elections, wrote Julian Zelizer. \u201cAs Democrats tackle voting rights and infrastructure, they face a critical turning point \u2013 with Manchin posing a huge political hurdle. Biden and Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer must remember that their party is bigger than one lone senator. \u2026 The clock is ticking. Democrats need to solve their Manchin problem before it\u2019s too late.\u201d The West Virginia senator should be applauded for his views about the Senate, wrote Scott Jennings. \u201cOur closely divided country could benefit from leaders who can produce outcomes that solve problems without trampling on half the country\u2019s views. Getting rid of the filibuster and abusing reconciliation is simply not keeping with the spirit of the body, and Manchin knows it.\u201d Republicans have criticized Biden\u2019s broad definition of infrastructure. Giovanna Gray Lockhart observed that family caregiving \u201cis quiet, mostly invisible and mostly by women. It also forms the bedrock of many people\u2019s lives. It\u2019s what allows them to leave the home to work and go to college and support their families and get ahead. Call it economic infrastructure, because that is what family care giving is. Our economy would collapse without it.\u201d Top corporate executives are increasingly speaking out on social and political issues, including Georgia\u2019s new law limiting voter access. And that\u2019s not sitting well with Republicans. \u201cStay out of politics,\u201d Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell warned CEOs. \u201cFrom election law to environmentalism to radical social agendas to the Second Amendment, parts of the private sector keep dabbling in behaving like a woke parallel government.\u201d Lincoln Mitchell noted, \u201cThese comments sound particularly absurd coming from a leader of a Republican Party that for generations has been the party of big business, not least because CEOs and other business leaders have long been an important fundraising source for the Republican Party and for McConnell specifically.\u201d More than 70 Black executives signed a letter last month urging corporations to support voting rights. As Peniel E. Joseph wrote, \u201cMartin Luther King Jr. spoke of the \u2018fierce urgency of now\u2019 in the context of the need for America to overcome its tragic racial and political history by confronting it truthfully, with love and justice, in public \u2026 the fact that this sentiment is being expressed by Black business leaders and CEOs bears witness to the extraordinary political crisis this nation continues to face. It also exemplifies the importance, now more than ever, of speaking truth to power about issues that transcend partisanship, ideology and politics to occupy the very recesses of the American soul.\u201d The number of bills introduced in 47 states to limit voter access is now more than 360, Norman Eisen and Joanna Lydgate noted, and they flow from former President Donald Trump\u2019s lie that the election was stolen from him by fraud. \u201cThere is no need to suppress voting everywhere to address purported wide-scale fraud that never existed anywhere,\u201d wrote Eisen and Lydgate. They outlined steps that the courts, state legislators and Congress could take to protect voting rights. As prosecutors in the Derek Chauvin trial moved through their slate of witnesses last week, attention turned to questions about police procedures and the cause of George Floyd\u2019s death. \u201cAt least 10 law enforcement witnesses have testified,\u201d wrote Elliot Williams, \u201cand all have largely agreed with each other around the same general principle: that Chauvin used excessive force that went beyond the training he received from the Minneapolis Police Department.\u201d Why so many from law enforcement? \u201cFor reasons baked deeply into America\u2019s culture and its legal system, a conviction could be incredibly hard to secure in this case. It is in the prosecution\u2019s interest to overwhelm the jury with evidence from police officers,\u201d Williams observed. \u201cThe medical evidence in George Floyd\u2019s death is complex \u2013 and likely key to whether Derek Chauvin, the former officer accused of killing Floyd, will be convicted,\u201d wrote Dr. Judy Melinek, a forensic pathologist. \u201cThe Hennepin County Medical Examiner found a combination of injury, natural disease and drugs were responsible for his death. Some of these findings, individually, could have caused his death, and yet in this case they appear to have worked in concert.\u201d In Politico, Rosa Brooks asked a question that goes beyond Chauvin\u2019s fate. What about the three other officers who were at the scene? \u201cTheir sheer passivity was, in some ways, more stunning than Chauvin\u2019s casual cruelty. They all stood by and watched as Chauvin pressed Floyd\u2019s face into the ground and as Floyd\u2019s pleas for help grew increasingly desperate. Ultimately, they stood by and watched him die.\u201d The role of fellow officers in calling out abuses is crucial for proper policing, wrote Louis Dekmar, the chief of police in LaGrange, Georgia, and Collette Flanagan, founder of Mothers Against Police Brutality. \u201cForging a culture that encourages officers to step up when witnessing misconduct will not be accomplished with a few new rules and stern messages from watch commanders. It requires top-to-bottom changes in recruitment, hiring, supervision, accountability, discipline and technology \u2013 and often, amending state laws and community standards.\u201d Hunter Biden, a favorite target for Trump and his allies, came out with a memoir this week titled \u201cBeautiful Things.\u201d At the first presidential debate last fall, wrote Nicole Hemmer, Joe Biden\u2019s defense of his son \u201cdemonstrated the stark difference between the two candidates \u2013 one fueled by grievance, the other by empathy \u2013 and also showed how sharply Americans\u2019 attitudes toward addiction have shifted in recent years.\u201d She noted, \u201cthere is a real upside for both Hunter and Joe Biden in centering Hunter\u2019s challenges of addiction. Now that Americans have come to treat addiction with more empathy, both Bidens understand that a story of addiction would not compound the conspiracies swirling around Hunter, but offer a potential escape from them.\u201d \u201cThe story he tells is one of addiction against the backdrop of intense loss and love: a close-knit and interdependent family shattered again and again by inexplicable tragedy,\u201d Hemmer observed. Along with targeting voting access, conservative state legislators around the country are pushing bills to disqualify transgender athletes. \u201cState legislators across the country have introduced dozens of bills that would bar transgender girls from competing in girls\u2019 sports,\u201d wrote former congressman Joe Kennedy, who headed the Trans Equality Task Force in the House. The measures stem from what he called a \u201cmisguided concern that their participation would somehow hurt their cisgender teammates and competitors.\u201d \u201cIt is a claim so absurd that you almost laugh at first,\u201d Kennedy said. \u201cThe examples of this happening are essentially zero. School districts, colleges, and the NCAA have protocols in place to ensure fair treatment for kids of all genders and gender identities. One of the plaintiffs who recently filed a lawsuit in Connecticut alleging that transgender girls have an advantage over cisgender girls went on to defeat one of the trans athletes targeted in the lawsuit just days after it was filed.\u201d In Arkansas, the General Assembly overrode a surprising veto from Gov. Asa Hutchinson of what Allison Hope called \u201cperhaps the most egregiously anti-transgender bill in modern US history \u2026 making their state the first in the country to outlaw gender-affirming treatment for trans youth.\u201d Amazon founder Jeff Bezos, believed to be the world\u2019s wealthiest man, isn\u2019t ordinarily a supporter of higher taxes \u2013 and his company has been famously called out for paying very little. But this week he endorsed Biden\u2019s infrastructure plan and supported an increase in the corporate tax rate. \u201cThere\u2019s a time for everything, including to tax and spend,\u201d wrote tax expert Edward J. McCaffery. \u201cJeff Bezos gets it. Wall Street does, too; Goldman Sachs and others have come out with tepid endorsements or at least muted criticisms of the proposed tax hike.\u201d Corporate taxes have plunged in recent decades, while workers have been paying higher income and payroll taxes. \u201cIf taxes are the price we pay for a civilized society, as Oliver Wendell Holmes once put it,\u201d McCaffery wrote, \u201cit is well past time to get the richest corporations in the history of civilization to pay some fair share of them, before our civilization crumbles and collapses. Even the man with the most to lose agrees.\u201d Peniel E. Joseph: DMX was a Gen X icon who gave Black men like me a stronger voice Michael D\u2019Antonio: Mike Pence knows the truth about Trump, but will he tell all? Ruth Ben-Ghiat: The new lies of the GOP and Tucker Carlson Roger Brooks: Why teaching the horrors of the Holocaust is vital Don Lincoln: It took a sea and land journey to prove to scientists they were wrong about physics Lara Freidenfelds: The problem with \u2018bereavement\u2019 leave after pregnancy loss David A. Andelman: The window of opportunity is closing fast on an Iran nuclear deal AND\u2026 When Prince Philip was born in 1921 in Corfu, Greece, George V, the grandfather of Queen Elizabeth, sat on the throne of Britain \u2013 and did double duty as Emperor of India. The King of England had been an officer in the royal navy, as Philip would be during World War II. But there was little reason to think that Philip, Prince of Greece and Denmark, would ever become a central figure in the British royal family. Yet Philip married Princess Elizabeth in 1947, and his passing this week was felt by many in the UK as \u201ca death in the family,\u201d wrote Kate Maltby. \u201cLike the death of Pope John Paul II in 2005, or Elizabeth Taylor in 2011, the death of the Queen\u2019s consort is one of those great passings that ruptures our sense of the world\u2019s continuity,\u201d Maltby observed. \u201cThe world is dark, unstable and changing rapidly: the loss of the Duke of Edinburgh will feel to many British people like a farewell to an old order.\u201d \u201cThere is more here, however, than the mere death of a long-lived celebrity. In Britain, we have a tendency to project our private family dynamics onto the Royal Family. Like our own family, they are born into a relationship with us \u2013 unless like Philip, they marry in young and stick around for decades. We pore over photos of the royal children being walked by hand to their first day at school; we watch their weddings and cry over their funerals. As our families adapt to an evolving world, they adapt too, but in public. It is the price paid for the royal family\u2019s greatest trick: pretending to be normal.\u201d Philip, who was 99, \u201cnavigated this public scrutiny with pragmatism, despite his visible frustration with it and some missteps along the way. He always made clear that he understood a price needed to be paid for privilege.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Peniel E. Joseph is the Barbara Jordan chair in ethics and political values and the founding director of the Center for the Study of Race and Democracy at the LBJ School of Public Affairs at the University of Texas at Austin, where he is also a professor of history. He is the author of several books, most recently, \u201cThe Sword and the Shield: The Revolutionary Lives of Malcolm X and Martin Luther King Jr.\u201d The views expressed here are his own. View more opinion articles on CNN. Black business leaders\u2019 efforts to stop voter suppression in the wake of Georgia\u2019s recently enacted voting bill illustrate the vanishing separation between protest and politics in America today. They also embody the work of Georgia\u2019s most famous civil rights activist, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. Over 70 Black executives, led by former American Express CEO Ken Chenault, signed a letter released at the end of March that pressed corporate America to take a stand on voting rights, one of the central moral and political issues in the United States today. \u201cThe new law and those like it are both undemocratic and un-American, and they are wrong,\u201d the letter explains. \u201cMemo to Corporate America: The Fierce Urgency of Now,\u201d which debuted as a full-page ad in The New York Times, channels Dr. King\u2019s words from his April 4, 1967, Riverside Church Speech criticizing the Vietnam War to uphold the sanctity of voting rights in America. The letter outlines the way that seeming race \u201cneutral\u201d or ostensibly colorblind laws and policies can be designed to have race-specific outcomes that harm the Black community. King described the need to transform American democracy against the maelstrom of war, racism, violence, and poverty as \u201cthe fierce urgency of now.\u201d The letter spoke for many by expressed a blunt truth: \u201cThere is no middle ground here,\u201d he said. \u201cYou either are for more people voting, or you want to suppress the vote.\u201d Other high-profile signers of the letter included Kenneth Frazier, CEO of Merck, Melody Hobson, the co-chief executive of Ariel Partners and Robert F. Smith, the billionaire CEO of Vista Equity Partners. MLB moving All-Star Game from Georgia after voting law The letter triggered national media attention, as did belated criticism of the law \u2013 which includes provisions to impose restrictions on distributing food and water to people waiting in line to vote \u2013 in corporate statements by Atlanta-based companies Delta and Coca-Cola expressing public support for voting rights. Major League Baseball has moved the All-Star Game from Atlanta to Denver and grassroots organizers are calling for boycotts of the state of Georgia until the recently passed legislation is reversed. Backlash from the some on the right against MLB was immediate and harsh, with Texas Gov. Greg Abbott refusing to throw out the first pitch at the Texas Rangers\u2019 opening game. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell warned corporate leaders to \u201cstop taking cues from the Outrage-Industrial Complex.\u201d Former Arkansas governor turned pundit, Mike Huckabee, went further, tweeting: \u201cI\u2019ve decided to \u2018identify\u2019 as Chinese. Coke will like me, Delta will agree with my \u2018values\u2019 and I\u2019ll probably get shoes from Nike & tickets to @MLB games. Ain\u2019t America great?\u201d That tweet has roundly been condemned as overtly racist, but also exemplifies the culture of intolerance and hate that plagues American politics. But former Time Warner CEO Dick Parsons, one of the signers of the letter and a self-described lifelong Rockefeller Republican, insisted to CNN that the law is \u201cjust a baldfaced attempt to prevent or suppress the number of Black voters who show up to vote in Georgia.\u201d Coca Cola, Delta Airlines strike back at Georgia voting laws From a historical perspective, Georgia\u2019s voter suppression effort represents an especially painful reminder of the precarious nature of racial progress in America. The Peach State\u2019s measure is one of hundreds of bills in over 40 states aimed at Black voters and voters of color around the nation. Meanwhile, as this letter, the corporate statements and the continuing calls for corporate boycotts in Georgia demonstrate, Atlanta \u2013 the birthplace of Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. \u2013 remains a site of historic movements for racial justice. King\u2019s voting rights legacy hovers over Georgia and the entire nation, punctuated most recently by the Senate runoff election victories of Reverend Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff. Warnock\u2019s victory proved especially sweet as he presides over Dr. King\u2019s former pulpit at Ebenezer Baptist Church. Further, in their determination to speak out and demand that others in their corporate community do the same, these Black business leaders are embodying the best of America\u2019s history of civil rights advocacy. Dr. King famously defined moral silence in the face of great evil as a kind of public and personal betrayal. The silence from a number of major corporations about voter suppression bills circulating in multiple states \u2013 just months after the most racially divisive presidential election in history and the White riot at the US Capitol \u2013 is deafening. It also illustrates the limits of the hashtag solidarity and virtue signaling support for Black Lives Matter that broke out across social media last year in the wake of the protests following the death of George Floyd. What Jim Crow looks like in 2021 This letter by African American executives, in calling on their overwhelmingly White peers to take a firm and public stance on racial justice, represents the best tradition of King\u2019s activism. He insisted that White moderates who refused to forcefully take a stand against racial injustice were as large a problem as overt segregationists. The reverberations of this letter have been swift and impactful. Many more White business leaders, including JPMorgan Chase CEO Jaime Dimon, have released statements in support of voting rights. Black, and now White, corporate leaders expressing support for voting rights join a chorus of voices led by Black women organizers such as Stacey Abrams and by Sen. Raphael Warnock. The call for action by Black business leaders, though it has had these promising effects, also illustrates the chasm between corporate America\u2019s statements promoting diversity and America\u2019s contemporary political reality: racial division and blatant efforts to suppress Black voters. It is worth noting that, in the wake of Republican-led efforts to pass \u201cbathroom bills\u201d designed to discriminate against LGBTQ school children, dozens of companies signed a statement condemning the legislation. These companies embraced their moral responsibility to speak out against discrimination, though for some of them, racism thus far is proving a thornier issue. But this is a crisis that requires equally powerful and courageous allies.  Martin Luther King Jr. spoke of the \u201cfierce urgency of now\u201d in the context of the need for America to overcome its tragic racial and political history by confronting it truthfully, with love and justice, in public. Over a half-century later, the fact that this sentiment is being expressed by Black business leaders and CEOs bears witness to the extraordinary political crisis this nation continues to face. It also exemplifies the importance, now more than ever, of speaking truth to power about issues that transcend partisanship, ideology and politics to occupy the very recesses of the American soul.",

We\u2019re looking back at the strongest, smartest opinion takes of the week from CNN and other outlets. The word \u201ctrauma\u201d made its way into the English language from the ancient Greek verb that means to \u201cpenetrate.\u201d The first known use of it came in 1693 when it was described as \u201ca wound from an external cause.\u201d But today our notion of trauma goes beyond the physical to include the extreme mental anguish that can penetrate lives. In 2020, we had trauma every which way: a deadly pandemic, an economic plunge, a reckoning over race and a fraught election made for a time that will shape history for decades to come. That we are still coming to terms with all of it was clearer than ever this week. In a Minneapolis courtroom, witnesses relived the pain of George Floyd\u2019s public death, as prosecutors revealed that Derek Chauvin, then a police officer and now on trial for the events of last May, knelt on Floyd\u2019s neck for 9 minutes and 29 seconds, even longer than previously thought. \u201cWhat happened to him resembled a public execution, one that echoes for many the anti-Black lynchings that marked the Jim Crow era,\u201d wrote Peniel E. Joseph. A 9-year-old girl was one of the onlookers who testified. \u201cThat an innocent child, teenagers and well-meaning bystanders had to bear witness to his death \u2013 including a firefighter with training that might have saved Floyd\u2019s life \u2013 is truly extraordinary.\u201d For all the shock that the testimony produced, Joseph and others noted that Black Americans have become accustomed to such stark injustice. Nia-Malika Henderson recalled her mother\u2019s tears in 1992 when violence broke out in Los Angeles after police officers were acquitted of the beating of Rodney King, which had been captured on video. \u201c\u2018Black people are in so much pain,\u2019 she cried, covering her face with her hands and burying her head in her knees.\u201d Henderson isn\u2019t watching the murder trial of Derek Chauvin. She confessed that despite being a journalist, \u201cI have never seen the George Floyd video.\u201d On the trial, she wrote, \u201cI keep my television muted if it is onscreen. Or I change the channel to avoid seeing anything at all. More specifically, I, like so many others who have seen too much, am avoiding yet another display of Black pain, Black trauma and Black death.\u201d Her mother is watching the trial and texted her children, \u201cWe owe George Floyd.\u201d And Henderson agrees. \u201cFloyd is owed. But he is not owed by Black people, whose suffering is too often on a constant loop, so much as he is by a nation that so regularly has enabled that suffering to continue.\u201d Calling it \u201cone of the most important trials this country has ever seen,\u201d legal analyst Elie Honig said the defense will \u201cargue that Chauvin did not cause Floyd\u2019s death\u201d and \u201cmay claim that Chauvin\u2019s actions were necessary to physically restrain Floyd and take him into custody.\u201d The prosecution\u2019s case is straightforward, \u201cbut the outcome is anything but certain, and the stakes \u2013 for the entire country \u2013 are enormous,\u201d Honig noted. In a way, there are two trials going on \u2013 a narrow one to determine whether Chauvin is guilty beyond a reasonable doubt and a larger, symbolic one about justice in America. As Elliot Williams noted, many of the witnesses spoke to what they felt and saw without getting at the \u201ccentral legal dispute at the heart of the case \u2013 the technical cause of Floyd\u2019s death.\u201d Some \u201chighlighted the widespread guilt that so many felt over their failure to confront the gross inequalities baked into our daily lives that led to Floyd\u2019s death. They wondered whether they were complicit in perpetuating racial injustice, and whether they could have done anything more to combat it.\u201d The trauma of Jan. 6, when rioters stormed the Capitol aiming to stop the certification of the 2020 election, also lingers painfully. On Friday, security at the Capitol drew headlines when a driver on Constitution Avenue rammed a barricade. Police officer William \u201cBilly\u201d Evans was killed and a second officer was injured. The driver, identified as Noah Green, was shot to death by police, who said he was holding a knife. The January attack at the Capitol was deeply personal for Theresa J. Fanone. Her son is a 20-year veteran of the Metropolitan Police Department. Fanone was watching the insurrection on television when she got an \u201cemotional, tearful\u201d call from Michael Fanone\u2019s police partner informing her he had been injured. \u201cMy first conversation with Michael, who sounded terrified, began with, \u2018Mom, the hate in those people\u2019s eyes, they wanted to kill me, they kept screaming, \u2018kill him, kill him, get his gun and kill him.\u2019 Michael, along with many other officers, had been holding the door to the West Tunnel of the Capitol (the door the President uses when he takes the oath of office) when he was pulled through the doorway by the mob, pushed down the stairs, kicked, beaten, maced, tased repeatedly on his neck, had his face shield ripped off and his badge and radio taken.\u201d \u201cMichael\u2019s injuries resulted in a heart attack, due to trauma, stress and repeated tasing to his neck, burns on his neck and chest, a concussion, a traumatic brain injury and post-traumatic stress disorder.\u201d On March 25, former President Donald Trump called into a Fox News show to say his supporters had posed \u201czero threat\u201d that day in January and had been \u201chugging and kissing\u201d police officers. \u201cMy experience of that day, and every day since, has been significantly different,\u201d Theresa Fanone wrote. The febrile political climate in the United States has not gone away, as Dean Obeidallah pointed out. \u201cIn the past few days,\u201d he wrote, \u201cwe\u2019ve seen the Michigan GOP state chair invoke the specter of violence against those not loyal to Trump and conservative Trump media allies saying on Newsmax that they wished the military would step in and take over from President Joe Biden. Before the attack on the Capitol this type of language was wrong. Today it feels like a dangerous continuation of the type of incitement that led to the Jan. 6 attack.\u201d The wave of anti-Asian American violence that grew after Trump repeatedly labeled Covid-19 the \u201cChinese virus\u201d also hasn\u2019t gone away. In one incident, on Monday a 65-year-old woman of Filipino descent was punched and kicked on a New York City street by an attacker shouting anti-Asian slurs. Yumi Hogan, the first lady of Maryland and the first Korean-American first lady in the US, wrote, \u201cMy fellow Asian Americans weep over the rising number of attacks against our people. But in the face of this senseless violence, I see a new strength, determination and resilience in our eyes.\u201d \u201cWe will not stay silent anymore,\u201d Hogan observed. \u201cBut we will also not respond with vengeance. Instead, we will love each other more, we will support each other more, and we will stand together. We will make sure the overwhelming outpouring of support from leaders turns into real and lasting action that protects our children and grandchildren.\u201d For more views on hate and discrimination: SE Cupp: Hate lives here Kuan-lin F. Liu: When I told a hiring manager my Asian name, he said let\u2019s \u2018call you Fred\u2019 A year ago, Fiana Garza Tulip was sending videos of her seven-month-old daughter to her mother, who was \u201cfilled with such joy every time she received a clip of her only grandchild.\u201d Tulip\u2019s mother, Isabelle Hilton Papadimitriou, was a respiratory therapist, and last June had a confrontation with a hospital visitor who refused to wear a mask, citing Trump\u2019s failure to wear one. Covid-19 spread through her hospital department and a few weeks later, Papadimitriou died of the disease. She would have celebrated her 65th birthday this week.  Tulip noted that former White House Covid-19 coordinator Dr. Deborah Birx said on a CNN documentary that hundreds of thousands may have died needlessly from the disease. \u201cWhen the history of the American pandemic is written,\u201d Tulip wrote, \u201cmy daughter will ask how things got so bad. I will tell her that it was an age of failed leadership, a collapse of moral courage by those who should have spoken out, a distrust of science, and a time when people stopped caring for each other. I will make sure she knows that her grandmother, \u2018Abuelita Obie,\u2019 deserved so much better and she should still be alive today.\u201d Birx had a sterling reputation as a leader of programs to fight HIV/AIDS before she became coronavirus coordinator for the Trump administration. \u201cAccepting a job working for Donald Trump was her first and worst mistake,\u201d wrote Dr. Megan Ranney. \u201cBirx\u2019s next error was allowing the regime\u2019s lies to go unchecked. It\u2019s true that she said many things right, from her first day to her last. And as a White House team member, she would have found it hard to publicly contradict her boss. And it\u2019s understandable that she thought she would do more good from inside the administration instead of as an outside observer. She said this herself in January. But still \u2013 she could have drawn the lines of honesty and integrity much earlier.\u201d For more on Covid-19: Matthew M.

We can avoid it Kent Sepkowitz: Why the first state vaccine pass isn\u2019t ready for prime time On the heels of his success with passage of the $1.9 trillion Covid-relief act, President Joe Biden proposed an even bigger investment this week \u2013 in America\u2019s infrastructure. \u201cHis new American Jobs Plan is a comprehensive, well-targeted and timely approach to America\u2019s many long-term economic ills, responding powerfully to 40 years of federal neglect,\u201d observed economist Jeffrey D. Sachs. \u201cThis is a plan for all Americans in all parts of the country. The time has come to build America\u2019s future.\u201d Biden is a \u201cman in a hurry,\u201d wrote Frida Ghitis. \u201cWhether or not you agree with his priorities, it\u2019s undeniable that the scope of his actions in the last 70-some days has been enormous. And Biden \u2013 the man Trump frequently derided as \u2018sleepy\u2019 \u2013 is just getting started. His $2 trillion infrastructure proposal is his latest move in what is already one of the most ambitious presidencies in decades. And it\u2019s all happening at a dizzying speed.\u201d At 78, Biden is the oldest President in American history and he faces the possibility of seeing Democrats lose one or both houses of Congress in the November 2022 midterms. As Susan Glasser noted in the New Yorker, Biden is being \u201chailed as an aspiring modern-day F.D.R. or L.B.J. who will lead the country out of crisis.\u201d That may prove premature. \u201cThere is, of course, a key question that remains unanswered in the Capitol: Does Biden have the votes?\u201d Conservative pundits have kept busy deriding the President\u2019s behavior \u2013 his recent stumble on the stairs leading up to Air Force One, using note cards at his press conference, heading home to Delaware on some weekends and owning a dog that bit two federal workers. Focusing on such trivialities is a mistake, argued Lanhee J. Chen: \u201cThe more important critique is the one that should be leveled at the substance of Biden\u2019s presidency \u2013 the massive policy changes that he has already overseen and is proposing in the months and years to come. Republicans in Congress and across the country should be focusing their fire on Biden\u2019s policies and, even more importantly, presenting their own plans for solving some of the problems he proposes to address.\u201d For more on politics: Joshua A.

Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz \u201cis under investigation by the Justice Department, which is reportedly looking into whether he paid for the travel expenses of a 17-year-old girl across state lines to entice her into sexual activity,\u201d wrote legal analyst Jennifer Rodgers, a former federal prosecutor. Gaetz has lashed out in his defense, saying that \u201che and his father are the victims of an extortion plot by individuals who demanded $25 million in exchange for helping Gaetz with the sex trafficking investigation.\u201d But Rodgers observed that Gaetz\u2019 response doesn\u2019t fully work. \u201cThere is no basis at all to believe that the private citizens alleged to be behind extortion attempts beginning two weeks ago also caused the DOJ investigation into sex trafficking to begin months ago,\u201d she wrote. If the allegations denied by Gaetz turn out to be true, the \u201cscandal will be another test to show how far Republicans are willing to go to protect their own,\u201d noted Julian Zelizer. \u201cOver the past four-and-a-half years, we have repeatedly witnessed how the immense power of partisanship within the GOP overwhelms its moral concerns\u2026\u201d The extremism of some GOP members of Congress has been blamed on Trump, but a new book by former House Speaker John Boehner says it began well before the 45th president took office. Former Rep. Charlie Dent, a moderate Republican, pointed to Boehner\u2019s characterization of some Republicans elected in the 2010 midterms as morons. These members \u201cgained an outsized voice within the House GOP conference, bringing their extreme views and conspiracy theories to Congress. They pushed for legislation that had no chance of passing \u2013 including defunding Obamacare while President Barack Obama was in office and Democrats controlled the US Senate \u2013 and attempted to obstruct the raising of the debt ceiling, which would have led to fiscal Armageddon,\u201d Dent wrote. Did you know that Nintendo\u2019s Super Mario has a biographer? Jeff Ryan wrote the book on the character\u2019s prominence in the video game world and this week addressed the false rumors that \u201cSuper Mario, the mustached video game plumber, was going to be dead the day after March 31.\u201d In fact, Nintendo is scheduled to release another Super Mario game this year and was just making a few tweaks to its game lineup. As Ryan pointed out, Mario \u201cdies for a living\u201d in the games. Turns out he is based on the real-life Mario Segale, the landlord of the Seattle-area warehouse where thousands of Nintendo arcade cabinets were waiting to be refitted with a new game four decades ago. In 1986, Nintendo launched a home game console in the US, the NES, with Super Mario Bros. It was a huge hit, and many more have followed. Ryan wrote, \u201cNo Mario?

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Guthrie Graves-Fitzsimmons is the author of \u201cJust Faith: Reclaiming Progressive Christianity.\u201d The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion articles on CNN. \u201cYou go to church?\u201d That\u2019s a question I\u2019ve been asked by bewildered friends my entire adult life. As a gay man who advocates for social justice, I get why some people look askance when I mention what my Sunday plans entail. \u201cYes, I do.\u201d Sunday is Easter and I will be at church to celebrate this sign of God\u2019s solidarity with the oppressed. But I\u2019m not about to bemoan all those who aren\u2019t going to church today. Fewer and fewer Americans, especially young Americans, identify as Christians. While there are a number of factors impacting this trend, one stands out to me this Holy Week: The impact of the Christian right\u2019s political prominence in driving progressive Christians away from the faith. A recent study by two political scientists found that the rise of Americans who identify as \u201cnonreligious\u201d has resulted, in part, from backlash against the Christian right. While prominent progressive Christian voices exist, too often the loudest voices in American Christianity often sound nothing like Jesus \u2014 the radical healer and teacher who taught his followers to love their neighbor and free the oppressed. The \u201cJesus Saves\u201d signs at the US Capitol insurrection, Franklin Graham and Marjorie Taylor Greene\u2019s excoriations of LGBTQ rights and the US Catholic hierarchy\u2019s abysmal response to the sexual abuse scandal all make a mockery of Christian teaching about love, dignity and justice. Capitol rioters made a mockery of Christian values Consternation about church decline and the secularization of America reached a fever pitch this Holy Week when Gallup released a new poll that found a majority of Americans do not belong to church, synagogue or mosque. This was the first time the membership percentage fell below a majority since Gallup first started asking the question in 1937. These findings are troubling to many. \u201cThis is perhaps the most distressing graph related to the future of America,\u201d Eric Sammons, editor-in-chief of the conservative Catholic Crisis Magazine wrote on Twitter, adding, \u201cWe are officially living in a pagan nation.\u201d And it\u2019s not just conservative Christians. Shadi Hamid, a Brookings Institution scholar who is Muslim, expressed concern that Christianity is being replaced by \u201cWokeism\u201d in an interview with the Washington Post about the Gallup poll and in an essay for the Atlantic. Without Christianity, he wrote, our country will \u201cno longer have a common culture upon which to fall back.\u201d Yet seeing this poll released during Holy Week made me think about what it means as a Christian to reflect deeply on church decline. Jesus called on his followers not to live in fear, so I cannot in good faith lament church decline. Instead, I\u2019m hopeful for a resurrection of social justice-focused Christianity in America that lives up to the teachings of Jesus. The renegade Catholic clerics who shamefully backed Trump's Big Lie This Easter, I hope my fellow Christians who deeply care about the future of our movement to spread the Gospel of love will recommit ourselves to build a movement that more people want to join. We must contest the popular depiction of what it means to be a Christian today. Church decline is not a rejection of our message of love, it\u2019s a rejection of our movement\u2019s failure to model that message for the world. Since this poll has received so much attention, it\u2019s important to point out a few things. First, Christians, Jews, and Muslims are distinct religious groups with their own traditions and dynamics with regards to the membership at play. They collectively also don\u2019t represent all religious Americans. And membership is only one metric \u2014 some Americans participate in or attend houses of worship without claiming formal membership. We should also be careful not to equate membership with religious belonging or belief in God. Practicing faith does not always happen under the auspices of a house of worship; nor does maintaining a membership in one guarantee religious conviction. Some members remain because for them, it is the socially respectable thing to do, separate from beliefs or spirituality. Rev. Barber: 'This is a moment for America' There are problems with paying too much attention to any specific individual indicator of religious trends \u2014 for instance, decline in church membership doesn\u2019t necessarily mean society overall has grown more secularized \u2014 but there is a host of recent research that points towards declining membership, attendance and reported importance of religion in Americans\u2019 lives. Polling from the Public Religion Research Institute and Pew Research Center mirror the new poll findings from Gallup.  A 2019 survey by the conservative American Enterprise Institute shed light on several reasons why Americans, especially young Americans, are leaving religion. One finding stuck out to me: \u201cNearly six in 10 (59 percent) young people say religious people are generally less tolerant, while only 34 percent of seniors agree.\u201d In my book \u201cJust Faith: Reclaiming Progressive Christianity,\u201d I examine the question of how perceptions of Christianity at-large are shaped by the media. I call the media\u2019s focus on the more outrageous expressions of our faith the Westboro Baptist Church Effect. The church is virulently anti-LGBTQ and offensive, but get vastly more attention than the small size of their congregation deserves. In the past year, we\u2019ve seen this with the media\u2019s obsession about White evangelicals during the 2020 election. Will they or will they not turn out for Trump? My question was a different one: Who are the faith-based backers of the devoutly Catholic candidate for president? During the pandemic, almost all churches heeded public health guidance and moved away from in-person services. Yet we\u2019ve paid more attention to the few churches opposed to Covid-19 orders than the churches who faithfully saved lives by moving to digital gathering spaces. Covid-19 vaccines are an answered prayer for all faiths It\u2019s understandable why some people are leaving church when these are the stories we hear about Christians. They just sound nothing like the stories about Jesus we read in the Gospels. In Luke\u2019s Gospel, Mary Magdalene, Mary the mother of Jesus, and other women visit the tomb of Jesus only to realize it is empty. They are told, \u201cWhy do you look for the living among the dead?\u201d Likewise, we as Christians should not look for the living Jesus movement among the dead remains of conservative Christian hate that looks nothing like the love Jesus embodied. Instead, we should look forward to a resurrection of Christianity that fights system oppression and stands in solidarity with the most vulnerable. We should look for the living of the Gospel among America\u2019s youth today. Alongside their relative lack of formal religious devotion, today\u2019s young Americans are known for their commitment to social justice. Two surveys from Pew Research Center illustrate this dynamic. While disaffiliation from religion is rising fastest among young Americans, researchers also found that majorities of the Generation Z and the millennial generations are more approving of the country\u2019s increasing racial and ethnic diversity, as well as interracial and same-sex marriage, than older generations. Millennials are born between roughly 1981 and 1996 and followed by Generation Z, born between 1997 and 2010. According to the CIRCLE/Tisch College 2020 Youth Survey, 27% of Americans ages 18-24 say they have attended a march or demonstration. What our second Covid Lent reveals about sacrifice They are the generation whose stereotype most resembles what Christians should be known for: restless for a better world and refusing to comply when their elders tell them to obey the rules. The #BlackLivesMatter movement, the #MeToo movement, the fight for boldly overhauling our democracy and economy. These are the same causes Jesus championed in the Gospels. Imagine if American Christianity at-large were known to share the concerns of young progressive leaders today like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, who is vocal about how her own Catholic faith has shaped her concerns for social justice. Thankfully, Ocasio-Cortez is just one of the progressive Christians who are speaking up in the political sphere where so much harm has been perpetrated by conservative Christianity. There\u2019s also newly elected US Sen. Raphael Warnock and Transportation Secretary Pete Buttigieg. Sen. Warnock spoke about faith and voting rights during his first speech on the floor of the US Senate and Buttigieg spoke about being a gay Christian during his presidential run. They each embody the mission of Jesus followers to work for social justice.  While Ocasio-Cortez, Warnock, and Buttigieg are three of the most vocal progressive Christians living out their faith in the public square, they are the latest in a long history of activism. \u201cThe progressive wing of Christianity is not, of course, new,\u201d New York Times columnist Nicholas Kristof recently wrote, highlighting several other examples of progressive Christian activism. \u201cIt began with Jesus.\u201d For Christians celebrating today, Easter means that God\u2019s love is more powerful than the systems of oppression that crucified Jesus. It\u2019s our responsibility as followers of Jesus to join in the work of fighting those systems of oppression \u2014 alongside such powerful leaders today like the Rev. Dr. William Barber II of the Poor People\u2019s Campaign and Sister Simone Campbell of Nuns on the Bus. As I head to (online) church this Easter, I respect how people may not feel inclined to identify as Christians or join a church for good reasons. There\u2019s no reason to bemoan that reality. Instead, let\u2019s make the church actually live up to its calling. Only then, God willing, will I be interested in what the church membership numbers report.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Joshua A. Douglas is a professor at the University of Kentucky\u2019s J. David Rosenberg College of Law who specializes in election law, voting rights, and constitutional law. He is the author of \u201cVote for US: How to Take Back Our Elections and Change the Future of Voting.\u201d Follow him @JoshuaADouglas. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own; view more opinion at CNN. The new Georgia voting law, which includes a mix of onerous voter restrictions and a few mild expansions for voters, is bad enough. Courts\u2019 deference to state legislatures on election laws compounds the problem. Georgia SB 202 imposes numerous new voting hurdles: a shorter absentee voting window, new ID rules for absentee ballots, limits on the number and availability of ballot drop boxes, and a strange prohibition on anyone but poll workers providing food or water to voters waiting in line. How could offering someone water while they stand in a long line unduly influence their vote? The law gives the State Election Board greater authority to intervene in the actions of county election boards, opening the door to a partisan takeover of local election authority. Opponents have compared the law to Jim Crow-era policies that make it harder for racial minorities to cast a ballot. But the law also offers a few mild voter expansions: Increases in early voting, for example, including an additional mandatory Saturday. There are also some provisions that will ease election administration, such as permitting counties to start processing, but not counting, absentee ballots earlier, which will allow for faster announcement of results on election night. Opponents immediately filed suit. The problem is they have an uphill battle to successfully challenge the worst aspects of the law. That\u2019s because the Supreme Court and lower federal courts have espoused a particularly crabbed view of the constitutional right to vote. In the 1960s, the Court understood voting as a fundamental right, \u201cpreservative of other basic civil and political rights.\u201d The Court applied strict scrutiny, or the highest level of review \u2013 simply put, a state would have to provide a really strong reason for burdening the right to vote. But over the ensuing decades the Court has weakened that protection, culminating in a 2008 case in which the Court refused to strike down Indiana\u2019s voter ID law. The Court showed deference to the state to pass a law that targeted in-person voter fraud even though there is no evidence that in-person impersonation actually exists to any significant degree. The Court also removed a key protection of the Voting Rights Act in a 2013 decision that would have prevented Georgia and other states with a history of racial discrimination from enacting a law that has a disproportionate impact on minority voters. Sports world should boycott Georgia over racist voting law The problem became even worse during the 2020 election last year. In a series of emergency cases, the Court and the federal appellate courts sided with states over and over again. Voters argued that state laws, such as on the deadlines for returning absentee ballots, made it particularly difficult to cast their votes during the pandemic. Many district courts, looking at the evidence, agreed, ordering states to ease election rules to help voters. But the appeals courts deferred to the states. They said that courts should not second-guess state election administration, even with strong evidence of likely disenfranchisement. (The same principle of deference was one reason courts rejected the post-election litigation, filed by lawyers representing the previous President\u2019s team, which tried to overturn the results, though of course in those cases the courts were protecting votes already cast.) Unfortunately, this narrow jurisprudence led to actual disenfranchisement. Wisconsin, for example, threw out over 1,000 absentee ballots because they did not arrive until after the polls closed. Similarly, Missouri voters who used the state\u2019s temporary \u201cmail-in\u201d ballot process due to concerns about Covid were more likely to have those ballots rejected, especially given that the state forbade them from delivering their completed ballots in person. Court rulings initially would have relieved the burdens on voters in these states, but the appeals courts reversed those decisions. The courts allowed the legislatures\u2019 rules to stand even in the face of harm on voters and correspondingly weak state interests. And therein lies the further problem with the Georgia law \u2013 and likely one reason why the legislature felt emboldened to pass a restrictive law in the first place. The Republican legislature, seeing control of the state slip away \u2013 especially as the state\u2019s Black population has increased and voted for Democratic candidates \u2013 passed a law to make it harder to vote to try to keep themselves in power. They did so knowing that plaintiffs would have a difficult time challenging the law in court. We should hope that courts would stand in the way of a partisan legislature that acts with pure self-interest when crafting voting rules. After all, election law is the exact area in which politicians are most likely to enact rules to help keep themselves in power, meaning that deference to the legislature is particularly unwarranted. The federal courts\u2019 recent track record, however, has been disappointing.  To truly effectuate the constitutional right to vote \u2013 the most important right in our democracy \u2013 the courts must carefully scrutinize this Georgia law. If they do so, they will see that many of its provisions, such as making it a crime to offer water to thirsty voters waiting in line, are unconstitutional and unlawful. While the few voter expansions in the law are laudable, the state has no valid justification for many of its voting restrictions. The courts should not make the mistake of deferring to the legislature in how to run elections. Otherwise, the foxes will truly be guarding the hen house.",

View more opinion articles on CNN. \u201cIt\u2019s a redux of Jim Crow in a suit and tie.\u201d That\u2019s how Stacey Abrams, who spearheaded efforts to organize Black voters in Georgia for the 2020 election, recently described the deluge of new voter restriction laws proposed by Republicans in the Georgia state legislature in the wake of their defeat. Cliff Albright of the Black Voters Matter Fund echoed Abrams, saying the new restrictions, which include new ID requirements and limits on drop boxes, are just \u201cputting a little makeup and cologne on Jim Crow.\u201d The idea that these new voting restrictions are a more sanitized version of Jim Crow says a lot about popular understanding of that era of racism and discrimination (something Abrams and Albright clearly know, and are speaking to). Next to images of White protesters snarling at civil rights activists at sit-ins in Greensboro, North Carolina, in 1960 or police officers siccing German Shepherds on Black schoolchildren in Birmingham, Alabama. In 1963, the image of legislators calmly enacting a series of discriminatory restrictions seems far more civilized. Yet, even at its violent peak, Jim Crow had another side, one that always wore a suit and tie, especially when it came to voter disenfranchisement. Required to navigate around the 15th Amendment, which explicitly prohibited barring Black men from voting, White Southern legislators innovated a kind of colorblind racism that would go on to become the right\u2019s preferred tool for opposing civil rights advances in the post-Jim Crow era. Looked at through that lens, the current rush to restrict voting rights is less proof of the resuscitation of Jim Crow than evidence that it never really went away. Jim Crow, a name derived from racist minstrel shows that would come to stand in for the entire segregationist regime of the South, emerged in the late 19th century as a series of anti-Black laws: laws that stripped Black men of the right to vote, segregated public spaces, barred Black people from certain types of jobs. Disenfranchisement, which came first and helped make the rest possible, was neither an easy nor a nonviolent process. It involved paramilitary violence against Black and Republican voters, mass voter fraud, and, in places like Wilmington, North Carolina, an outright White supremacist coup against the sitting government. Only after White Democrats wrested power away from Reconstruction state governments in the 1870s and 1880s were they able to institute laws that stripped Black people of the right to vote. Redemption governments, as these new White supremacist legislatures were known, instituted laws that were, on their face, racially neutral, even though their intent and effect were to disenfranchise Black voters. Poll taxes and literacy tests backed by discriminatory voter registrars did most of the work. Martin Luther King III: This is what my father would have done Some states also instituted grandfather clauses \u2013 laws that said a person could vote if someone related to them could vote before the end of the Civil War \u2013 in order to rescue poor White voters who were also disenfranchised by their inability to pay the taxes and pass the tests. The clauses were a way to build White racial solidarity despite the entrenched economic inequality of the region. The Jim Crow regime that followed and lasted until the mid-1960s was purposefully built to make racial apartheid look respectable in an orderly, ostensibly nonviolent way. White politicians, teachers, and business leaders all pitched segregation laws as fundamentally progressive, a way to keep the peace in a land that had been racked by postwar violence. It was, of course, enforced by profound violence, from the Ku Klux Klan to Southern police forces to orgies of violence that accompanied massive resistance in the 1950s and 1960s. But White Southerners used Jim Crow laws to flip the arguments about the cause of that violence. It was not, in their telling, White southerners who were to blame, but the outside agitators and local Black activists who did not follow the laws of the Jim Crow South. That was propaganda \u2013 a point made viscerally clear during the nonviolent protests of the civil rights era \u2013 but it was propaganda that has remained a powerful political tool to this day. That propaganda also hid the way disenfranchisement enabled so much of the violence in the White South. Without access to political power, Black voters had little control over policing or public safety or any of the laws that constrained their citizenship. More than that, to deny Black Southerners the right to vote was to deny their full citizenship and, indeed, their full humanity. The denial of citizenship rights is fundamentally dehumanizing, enabling and encouraging the very brutality that White Southern elites used Jim Crow to distance themselves from. Stacey Abrams: It's time to make an exception to the filibuster rule Court rulings in the 1940s and 1950s, most notably Brown v. Board of Education in 1954, chipped away at these overtly discriminatory practices, and the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 did away with the old Jim Crow regime altogether over time. The Voting Rights Act of 1965 offered new protections for Black voters, primarily through federal enforcement and oversight of traditionally discriminatory districts. But racist discrimination has proved to be a wily thing. When stripped of their law-and-order costume by new legislation and court rulings outlawing segregation, those in favor of White rule fashion a new suit and tie to wear. Colorblind racism became the style in conservative circles in the 1970s, and not just in the South. Antibusing activists in Boston shifted to talk of \u201cneighborhood schools\u201d instead of segregation, and 1980s, when President Ronald Reagan, who had opposed both the Civil Rights and Voting Rights Acts as he began eyeing a gubernatorial run in California, sought ways to thwart the new civil rights regime without championing explicitly racist laws. Take, for instance, his efforts to extend tax-exempt status to Bob Jones University, which had lost its federal tax credits because it banned interracial dating among its students. Or his opposition to school integration via busing and to affirmative action, which his administration framed as \u201creverse discrimination.\u201d See Kaitlan Collins' tough question for Biden It was the governing equivalent of the political dog whistle: it was no longer acceptable to be overtly racist in lawmaking or rhetoric, so conservative lawmakers used ostensibly neutral procedures to ensure that civil rights laws were only lightly enforced. Alongside efforts to dismantle the machinery of civil rights enforcement, Republicans began the Reagan era with coordinated efforts to intimidate Black voters with threats of arrest and violence in New Jersey \u2013 so much so that the party had to enter into a consent decree in the early 1980s to prevent officially-sanctioned voter intimidation (a consent decree that only recently expired). Following the election of Barack Obama, the party immediately passed hundreds of new voter restrictions that were facially neutral but carefully aimed at disenfranchising Black voters. As a federal judge ruled in 2016, voter restrictions like those in North Carolina \u201ctarget African-Americans with almost surgical precision.\u201d Now in the wake of the 2020 election, that targeting has resumed with renewed vigor.  Is this Jim Crow in a new suit, or just Jim Crow? The distinction hardly matters. What matters is that disenfranchisement, framed in racially neutral terms but with significant racist intent and impact, has been a cornerstone of the fight over voting rights in the US for nearly 150 years. Despite mountains of legislation and court rulings, the conservative turn by the Supreme Court (which gutted the Voting Rights Act in 2013) and the turn to minoritarian rule by the Republican Party have combined to create the most sustained assault on voting rights in the US since the 1960s. And while it may still wear a suit and tie, it also still marches hand in hand with both state violence and mob violence, as we were once again reminded during the insurrection at the Capitol. In fact, it\u2019s precisely because Jim Crow has always been clothed in respectability during the day and worn a hood at night that we should be on alert when we see a Jim Crow-like figure in a business suit, because if history is any indication, that\u2019s not the only way we\u2019ll see him before all is said and done.",

View more opinion on CNN. He lost the White House (big time), and (on his watch) his party lost the Senate and the House in the midterms. He lost Twitter and Facebook. Revenues are down across his business empire. What\u2019s a losing businessman-turned-politician to do? If he\u2019s former president Donald Trump, the answer is: use his principal assets \u2013 fame and attitude \u2013 to revive his brand through a \u201chostile takeover.\u201d He demonstrated this, for example, in his address to the Conservative Political Action Conference on Sunday. With the help of his son, Donald Jr., he claimed both the conference and the GOP as his own. After reports that he was privately considering starting a new political party, he ended weeks of speculation and declared that there was no need. \u201cWe have the Republican Party,\u201d he said, marking his territory. He also teased the crowd with musings about running for president again in 2024. The standing ovation that followed, and the red \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d caps in the crowd, proved that the Trump marketing magic still works on some. He will certainly need all the magic he can get, as his circumstances find him, and members of his family, pursued by the law (though his lawyers deny he or his family have committed any wrongdoing) and confronted by realities of a business marketplace that has largely had it with him. The deadly January 6 assault on the Capitol, which then-president Trump inspired, caused many companies in corporate America to sever ties with him. Faced with hundreds of millions of dollars in loans coming due \u2013 loans Trump personally guaranteed \u2013 many of the family properties have posted significant losses. The Trump hotel in Washington is for sale, but no one seems interested. But a clan once enriched by their real estate business and empowered by the presidency, can now offer as its stock in trade a combination of politics and entertainment. And both contribute to a certain type of fame, which Trump discovered could be quite valuable when he was the star of the TV show, \u201cThe Apprentice.\u201d According to The New York Times, Trump\u2019s ancillary fame-related revenues back then\u2014the licensing of the Trump name, the lucrative pitchman gigs, and more\u2013 exceeded the $197 million he made from the show itself. Monetizing fame in the post-presidency world of Trump requires a good story with high stakes and compelling characters. Check and check: The Trumps as \u201ccharacters\u201d are riveting to both those who love them and those who hate them. And the stakes? They include control over the GOP, the future of the family fortune and the prospect of serious legal peril. The latter was heightened days ago by a Supreme Court decision that gave New York prosecutors access to business records, including Trump\u2019s tax forms, which will aid them in investigations that potentially could lead to civil and criminal charges against those in his orbit. Meanwhile, Donald Trump Jr. was deposed by District of Columbia prosecutors investigation possible fraud allegations as part of a lawsuit related to 2016 inauguration spending. (His sister Ivanka sat for her deposition in December.) The organization has said it complied with all laws, and the former president has called the investigation a \u201cwitch hunt.\u201d Trump and his CPAC fans lead GOP down a losing path While anyone else might feel paralyzed by this kind of pressure, Trump has long shown he is quite comfortable turning it to his advantage. He likely sees an opportunity to once again play his familiar role: the powerful victim. The two parts of this construct may seem contradictory. Who would believe Wonder Woman as a damsel in distress? But Trump seems to know that a hero\u2019s journey must include encounters with evil opponents who almost defeat him. To hear Trump tell it, he\u2019s always being attacked by people with villainous motives. The investigation of his finances, which the Supreme Court permitted, is part of \u201cthe Continuing Political Persecution of President Donald J. Trump,\u201d  Trump said in a statement last week. \u201cThis is something which has never happened to a President before, it is all Democrat-inspired in a totally Democrat location, New York City and State.\u201d For drama\u2019s sake, President Victim omitted the fact that New York was the scene of the activities that have drawn the scrutiny of investigators. He was a citizen and resident of New York State and his businesses were headquartered there. New York, New York is where Trump began a long career of avoiding true accountability. In 1973, after he became part of management at his father\u2019s company, investigators alleged racial bias in the family real estate business and prosecutors sued. The result was a slap-on-the-wrist settlement that allowed the Trumps to avoid admitting wrongdoing. Forty-six years later, the abuse of state laws governing charitable foundations \u2013 among other things Trump used the foundation to promote his political campaign \u2013 was settled for a mere $2 million. For him, the song lyric should be \u201cIf you can get away with it there, you can get away with it anywhere.\u201d Escapes have been essential to the Trump storyline ever since the early 1990s, when his businesses were forced into bankruptcy, but he avoided personal liability. Having retained the trappings of wealth, he was able to swan about town until he could tell a story of amazing resilience as his hotels, apartment buildings and Atlantic City casinos, after losing a ton of money, returned to profitability. By 1997, he would publish \u201cThe Art of the Comeback,\u201d in which he framed his corporate bankruptcy as a smart business move. (Connoisseurs of Trump the dramatist will detect the odor of victimhood in its pages as he blames his trouble in part on federal lawmakers.) He appears ready to work that storyline for a new chapter in the Trump drama. Speaking at CPAC days prior to his father last week, Donald Trump Jr. imitated the former president by lobbing insulting jokes at media figures and Republicans like Rep. Liz Cheney (R-Wyoming) who resist the family\u2019s claim to control of the GOP. With his hands forming the letter \u201cT,\u201d Junior referred to the gathering as \u201cT-Pac,\u201d (as in \u201cTrump Pac\u201d) and declared the conference would \u201csolidify\u201d Donald Trump  as the future of the Republican party.\u201d  True to family form, he also slipped in a plug for a book he published last summer.  The plug signaled that while the Trumps lay claim to the GOP, they also see it as a financial opportunity. With prosecutors circling and their businesses in trouble, there\u2019s money to be made in their brand of political entertainment. A Trump political action committee raised $250 million since Trump lost the election and there\u2019s more to be earned from paid speeches and merchandise sold \u2013 on the premise that these embattled heroes need support. After offering up lots of complaints and grievance Trump the elder finished his CPAC speech with a direct appeal for funds, telling the crowd, \u201cThere\u2019s only one way to contribute to our efforts, to elect America first Republican conservatives, and in turn to make America great again, and that\u2019s through Save America, PAC, and DonaldJTrump.com.\u201d The Trumps are back, as victimized as ever, and eager to make a buck.

They change what they sell, adding or updating products and letting others go. This isn\u2019t news \u2013 or at least it wasn\u2019t, until American right-wing media outlets became obsessed with so-called \u201ccancel culture.\u201d Their latest focus is  Dr. Seuss. The company that controls the Seuss catalog has decided to pull six of his dozens of books, the earliest of which was written in 1937, because they contain racist images of Asians and Africans. This seems sensible: Seuss\u2019 estate has an interest in protecting and promoting his legacy, and that\u2019s not going to happen by selling racist books to kids. That is not an attack on a beloved children\u2019s author. It is a recognition that a small portion of his older work is out of place today. No one is canceling Dr. Seuss. On the contrary: he\u2019s being well-served. Still, this decision by the company, Dr. Seuss Enterprises, presumably made rationally and in response to the demands of the free market, has prompted a full-on right-wing freakout. The story got top billing on Fox News and has been burning up right-wing Twitter. It\u2019s being jammed into the same lazy narrative that has overtaken the right, where any criticism or change, including from companies refreshing their brands or seeking a more diverse audience, is \u201ccancellation.\u201d You\u2019d think nothing else was going on \u2013 that half a million Americans weren\u2019t dead from a virus that has ravaged the nation; that a vaccine rollout wasn\u2019t in full force; that Democrats, in the face of rock-solid Republican opposition aren\u2019t close to getting Americans a huge relief package after a year of fumbling inaction. Conservative networks like Fox could do some good here: White Republicans, their core viewer base, are the most likely group in America to say that they don\u2019t want or are hesitant to get the Covid-19 vaccine, with more than half of them saying they either won\u2019t get it or are unsure. The networks, the former president and right-wing commentators could all team up to tell their followers: If we want life to return to normal, then we need to reach something close to herd immunity, and that means getting vaccinated. CPAC's dangerous embrace of Trump Instead, they\u2019re whining about Dr. Seuss. They\u2019re ginning up cheap outrage rather than trying to improve their viewers\u2019 lives. And they\u2019re making a lot of money while they do it. These are not real stories. Taking Aunt Jemima off of a syrup bottle, rebranding Mr. Potato Head or changing the name of the Washington football team, doesn\u2019t tell us anything foreboding about our culture other than the fact that, like all cultures, it evolves. America is becoming more racially diverse, and as a result, many Americans have a lower tolerance for racism. Traditional gender roles, long shifting, continue to shift. Companies that are trying to sell their products into this changing market respond. But the American right has become the all-out party of gender and racial grievance, and they are hyper focused on two things: maintaining power, and not actually being held accountable for governing. That\u2019s why they obsess over culture war stories like Dr. Seuss: There\u2019s no legislative solution (unless they want to nationalize the children\u2019s book industry), so there\u2019s no way for the Republican Party to have failed to deliver on a promise; there\u2019s only finger-pointing at perceived enemies (liberals, wokes, Democrats), which rallies the troops. What are they being rallied for? They\u2019re not quite sure \u2013 but they know who they\u2019re against. Trump and his CPAC fans lead GOP down a losing path In the meantime, the one thing Republicans do seem interested in legislating is voting rights, which they are on a national campaign to scale back \u2013 they\u2019ve put forward a whopping 253 bills in 43 states that would make voting harder. And they\u2019re fueled by the lies of former President Donald Trump, who has claimed, against all evidence, that the 2020 election was stolen from him. Those claims eventually resulted in an attack on the US Capitol that left several people dead and some 140 police officers injured, but Trump\u2019s party has decided to embrace his message, not reject it. The end game is doing whatever it takes to install as many Republicans in office as possible, even if they\u2019re, for example, spectacularly cruel and radically unqualified, or serial fabulists. It would be funny and sad, this sputtering anger at an ever-changing world, if so many people weren\u2019t taking the rage-bait, and if it weren\u2019t coming at the expense of actually improving peoples\u2019 lives. Americans are suffering: While the hyper-wealthy may be thriving, the pandemic has widened already extreme American inequality into a yawning chasm; while liberal Democrats want to tax ultra-millionaires and billionaires and more moderate ones want to increase corporate taxes to get some assistance to the many who are struggling, Republican lawmakers who spent their time in power supporting Trump\u2019s tax cuts for the rich now say we can\u2019t afford a relief package.  Families are worried about how they\u2019re going to pay the electricity bill, whether their kids are falling forever behind, and whether this is the month an eviction notice will show up on their front door and they have to move their children into the family car. Republicans have attempted to block Democratic attempts to get them fast financial help. An 11-year-old boy froze to death in Texas last month when the state\u2019s power system failed; the Biden administration is currently worried that their infrastructure package will face vast right-wing opposition. Our health care system is so broken that a 7-year-old girl in Alabama has started a lemonade stand to pay for the brain surgery she needs; the GOP continues to attack the Affordable Care Act and undermine any effort to move toward a universal health care system. And conservatives think the top story is Dr. Seuss? If that\u2019s where we all turn our attention, how convenient for them.",

Wells\u201d (Atria/One Signal Publishers). The views expressed here are the author\u2019s own. Read more opinion on CNN. The mob action that took place at the US Capitol two weeks before the inauguration was a reminder that most White and Black Americans live in different worlds with vastly different realities. Most White people in America have the privilege to express their anger, to have their humanity recognized and their grievances heard even when they are loud, rowdy or destructive. There is a privilege to being able to scream at police officers and be met with compassion and patience. There is a privilege in feeling free enough to assemble in large numbers armed with assault weapons, to storm federal buildings, crash through windows, roam around a seat of power, take selfies, brandish flags with racist symbols \u2013 and leave unharmed. There is a privilege in being considered an individual making personal choices versus an example of an entire race. This feeling of freedom to take a violent approach to express feelings of being wronged is an extension of the unbridled barbarism and oppression my great-grandmother Ida B. Wells lived through over 100 years ago.  Born into slavery in 1862, Wells came of age during Reconstruction. Mexican vacation and organic food are on the alleged Capitol rioters' wish lists The progress of Black people was met with rage and violence then, too. Hate groups formed and reigns of terror were unleashed.  Black people were murdered with impunity for minor infractions or accusations of crimes. Mob rule ran rampant and more often than not, no White person involved in the murder of a Black person was ever held accountable. The idea that they were \u201ctaking their country back\u201d was the motivation for rolling back the gains achieved by Black Americans back then \u2013 and it echoed in 2021. Every Black person I know who watched the insurrectionists storm the Capitol on January 6 saw America\u2019s disparate racial realities in the in-your-face exhibition of White privilege on steroids. A deeply wounding reminder of all we cannot do. For us, it is not about wanting the freedom to commit violent acts. It is about wanting to see people prosecuted for those acts rather than feel they can commit them without consequences. It is about wanting Black people to receive the same grace by police as those who were gently escorted out of the capitol after breaking, entering, and desecrating it. How Ida B. Wells changed my life Black people know from 400 years of experience in this country that we do not have the freedom to express anger without being considered threatening \u2013 and sometimes shot or killed.  We do not have the freedom to brazenly enter the halls of power shirtless with painted bodies and headdresses and be regarded as individuals who are legitimately expressing ourselves. Then, be served organic food upon request once arrested days later. This is the reality Black Americans have known all along. Emboldened White people feel they have to right to question the presence of Black people in school dormitories, in coffee shops, in parks, in parking lots while listening to music. Police officers shot and killed Botham Jean and Breonna Taylor in their own homes. And then of course the murder of George Floyd, broadcast for the world to see, showed how police response to Black people\u2019s minor transgressions can result in death. As I watched the mob of so-called \u201cpatriots\u201d storm the Capitol with minimal law enforcement present, the fact that some of the vigilantes had plastic zip ties and weapons and walked away unharmed was mind-boggling.  It reminded me of how mobs in the late 19th and early 20th centuries gathered to participate in and watch lynchings of Black people, take pictures of each other\u2019s gleeful faces and convert them into postcards, and absolutely no one was arrested for murder. A Confederate flag at the Capitol summons America's demons In fact, Wells concluded there were times that law enforcement officers were either part of the mob or did nothing to stop them.  She wrote in the 1893 \u201cThe Reason Why\u201d pamphlet: \u201cThe mob spirit had increased with alarming frequency and violence. Over a thousand black men, women and children have been thus sacrificed the past ten years. Masks have long since been thrown aside and the lynchings of the present day take place in broad daylight.\u201d  My great-grandmother would have probably been disappointed but not surprised that lawless White men today are met with a wink and a nod. The history of White citizens policing Black people and railing against Black progress is centuries-long \u2013 from slave patrols, Black codes and sundown towns to today\u2019s harassment of people in driveways of their own homes. Wells documented hundreds of lynchings that took place during her time. When Black people have expressed anger and wanted to fight for the right to be free in the nation of their birth, the response has often been one of brutal militarized force. The entire summer of 2020 was an example of that.  And the summer of 2014, the spring of 1968, the summer of 1919 and more. Time and time again, when Black people have shown up and expressed their pain and rage, we are treated as threatening criminals who need to be oppressed and controlled. Capitol rioters made a mockery of Christian values Meanwhile, on January 6 the Capitol mob proudly displayed nooses and a Confederate flag while the whole nation watched. Federal prosecutors have charged over 100 defendants in connection with the Capitol riot. And yet, during the January 13 impeachment hearings dramatic false equivalencies were made between those who protested police brutality and social oppression during the summer to those who tried to violently overturn an election result they did not like. Again, conflating Black anger and hurt with criminality, while shrugging off White mayhem and destruction. So, in the midst of the joy and pride I felt on Inauguration Day watching Kamala Harris take the oath to assume the second most powerful political position in the land, my elation was tempered by the fact that huge swaths of this country\u2019s population resent her being there. Resent us being here. I can celebrate the fact that her achievement was made possible by the work of thousands of women, including Wells, in the suffrage movement and all of the freedom fighters who endured indignities over the decades. On January 20 there was a sense of hope that the dreams of our ancestors can come true.  We have experienced a century of laws that made way for racial progress \u2013 however morality and human decency cannot be legislated. My great-grandmother spent her life fighting for justice and equality so the next generations could enjoy the benefits of being treated as first-class citizens in this country. Black parents today want the same for their children and subsequent generations. We can take pride and joy in the milestone of a Black/South Asian woman breaking social and political barriers, while also acknowledging the unfinished work toward racial equality and justice that lies ahead.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Sign up to get our new weekly column as a newsletter. We\u2019re looking back at the strongest, smartest opinion takes of the week from CNN and other outlets. On Wednesday, three men wearing overcoats stood in the amphitheater of Arlington National Cemetery, grouped at a pandemic-proper social distance as American flags whipped in the wind behind them. In the center was former President George W. Bush and alongside him were former Presidents Bill Clinton and Barack Obama. They had just attended President Joe Biden\u2019s inauguration and were here to pledge their support to him in front of the American people. \u201cThe fact that the three of us are here talking about a peaceful transfer of power speaks to the institutional integrity of our country,\u201d said Bush, a Republican, in a video that was broadcast that evening. The tradition of such a transfer, Obama, a Democrat, pointed out, is \u201cover two centuries old.\u201d You wouldn\u2019t know from the harmony of their appeal that a little over 20 years ago, Bush had promised an administration, in contrast to Clinton\u2019s, that \u201cwill appeal to our better angels, not our darker impulses\u201d or that Obama had told Americans who were out of work in 2008 to blame \u201cthe failed policies of George W. Bush.\u201d The three men, now friends and members in good standing of the Presidents Club, were a symbolic affirmation of the central themes of Biden\u2019s inaugural address \u2014 that \u201cdemocracy has prevailed\u201d and \u201cwe must end this uncivil war that pits red against blue.\u201d But the real test of Biden\u2019s call for unity is what happens now \u2014 as the new President seeks Congress\u2019 support for Covid-19 relief and the Senate weighs how to try the impeached (for the second time) former President Donald Trump, who flew out of town the morning of the inauguration. \u201cThe occasion took on a surreal feeling,\u201d wrote SE Cupp. \u201cIt was a throwback to an earlier era, an era before \u2018American carnage.\u2019 Gone were the anger and division. No one suggested America needed to be made great again. The air of fraught anxiety had lifted. Even the US Capitol building didn\u2019t show the scars of its insurrection just two weeks ago.\u201d But it\u2019s no time to be complacent, she warned. \u201cThe last four years have tattooed a trauma on so many Americans, and it won\u2019t fade overnight. There\u2019s healing to do, and Biden has a long journey ahead.\u201d \u201cWe just hit the biggest reset button in history,\u201d wrote Van Jones, noting both the swearing in of Kamala Harris as the first woman elected to national office and Biden\u2019s speech. \u201cHe acknowledged and honored the cry for racial justice, 400 years in the making. He reached out to young people and people who are suffering. He promised to be a President for all Americans.\u201d To Peniel Joseph, \u201cThe President\u2019s words proved revelatory and compassionate. Now the nation awaits deeds to make those hopes real.\u201d David Gergen has worked as an adviser to four presidents. He\u2019s heard calls for unity before, but this time may be different. \u201cI came away from his inaugural address thinking we may finally have a president who can pull us back from the brink. There is something about the man that is compelling \u2014 the fire in his soul, his humility, his clear moral purpose.\u201d Republican Lanhee Chen endorsed Biden\u2019s call to end the \u201cuncivil war\u201d and wrote, \u201cIf our new president is able to do as he says and restore even some respect to the very real debates we are sure to have with one another, he will have been a success.\u201d The end of Trump\u2019s presidency was a relief for Jill Filipovic. \u201cI can finally feel myself beginning to unclench my jaw, drop my shoulders, and exhale,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThe past four years have felt like a lifetime \u2026 The news out of the White House will be slower, and almost certainly more boring. Adults will be in charge again \u2014 too late for so many, but hopefully in time to speed up a vaccine rollout and save thousands of lives. Simple values like honesty, accountability, decency and empathy will return.\u201d  GOP strategist and former congressional staff member Doug Heye observed that there\u2019s no \u201cguarantee of success\u201d for Biden. \u201cThese things are hard even in normal times, even when we agree.\u201d But the chances are better with Biden given \u201chis long career and deep relationships on Capitol Hill.\u201d David Axelrod recalled Mitch McConnell\u2019s words to President Obama in 2009 at their first private meeting with congressional leaders at the White House. \u201cA lot of us don\u2019t think you should be here, but you won and we\u2019re prepared to work with you,\u201d Axelrod quoted McConnell as saying. But in fact, \u201cResistance became the stratagem of choice for McConnell.\u201d Looking back on this extraordinary month, Julian Zelizer noted that it was not a given that democracy would prevail. \u201cWhat was extraordinary about the past few weeks was just how frail our constitutional system can be in an era of intense polarization and when one party has been radicalized. When a President and his party are willing to do whatever is necessary to achieve and retain power, it\u2019s possible that the system we cherish won\u2019t function. Had Republicans controlled the House of Representatives or had the election been closer, it isn\u2019t hard to imagine how the effort to overturn the results might have been successful.\u201d Credit for averting disaster belongs to American voters, judges, election officials, journalists, a majority of legislators, military leaders and police officers like Eugene Goodman, who was honored at the Inauguration after he \u201cheroically moved the rioters from where US senators were hiding during the electoral vote certification process,\u201d Zelizer noted.

Most people everywhere don\u2019t want to hate each other Dr. Susannah Hills is a pediatric airway surgeon in New York who has been on the front lines of the Covid-19 pandemic. Last week, as the disease continued to spread and claim lives, she got some good news: \u201cA Covid-19 patient of mine told me he is finally going home after four months in the hospital. His tracheostomy tube has been taken out and he\u2019s breathing on his own. He\u2019s finally able to walk again, with some help. It\u2019s a new beginning for him and, as he wished me a happy New Year, I felt hopeful for the first time in a long time.\u201d On a larger scale, she also sees positive news. \u201cBiden announced a new team of scientific advisers and created a Cabinet position for the director of the Office of Science and Technology Policy. The Incoming director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Dr. Rochelle Walensky, has publicly committed to leading with science and restoring public trust in the agency.\u201d Millions have been vaccinated in the US, though the rollout is \u201cfraught with problems,\u201d Hills noted. And, as Thomas Lake wrote, the mental health challenges posed by the long lockdowns and the deaths of more than 400,000 Americans won\u2019t be easy to overcome. \u201cWhen this is over we will all need help. We already do now. Some of us will get it. Most will not, whether for lack of time or money or motivation. There are not enough counselors to sift through the layers of mental and emotional wreckage and give us all the attention we need. \u201cThere are things we can do to help ourselves and each other. Tell your friends you love them. Tell them your troubles and listen to theirs. Show up for those family Zoom calls, whether or not you feel like it.\u201d  Lake quoted Dr. Erica Martin Richards, a psychiatrist and a medical director at the Sibley Memorial Hospital in Washington, who noted: \u201cThere are studies that show the importance of smiling. The importance of prayer. The importance of exercising.\u201d Lake added, \u201cShe regularly does all three.\u201d President Trump left the White House hours after issuing more than 100 pardons and other acts of clemency, many to associates and supporters. To Jennifer Rodgers, one category was particularly worth noting \u201cbecause of how it threatens our system of checks and balances, and what it reveals about the man behind the power: the pardoning of people found guilty of public corruption offenses. These are people who themselves abused the public trust, and whose wrongdoing was exposed by our carefully constructed, overlapping systems of oversight and enforcement that are designed to identify and punish corrupt government officials.\u201d To Elie Honig, among \u201cthe most odious of the pardons and commutations that Trump granted in his final hours\u201d were those to his former adviser Steve Bannon, Trump fundraiser Elliott Broidy, former Detroit mayor Kwame Kilpatrick and Paul Erickson, \u201cconvicted of wire fraud and money laundering as an offshoot of special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation of Russian interference in the 2016 election.\u201d Sen. Bernie Sanders\u2019 appearance at the inauguration \u2014 in mittens and Gore-Tex jacket \u2014 went viral, birthing a million memes, but his thoughts on the road ahead are also worth noting, since he\u2019s going to be the new chairman of the Senate Budget Committee. If Republicans won\u2019t support Biden\u2019s economic initiatives, Sanders wrote, he\u2019ll use the budget reconciliation process to pass legislation with only 51 votes, instead of the 60 needed to overcome a Senate filibuster. \u201cPoll after poll has shown that the American people want government to respond aggressively to address the crises they face. The job of Congress now is to listen to the American people, move our country boldly forward on a path to economic success and show voters that Democrats are prepared to do everything possible to improve their lives. This is an unprecedented moment in American history. We must act in an unprecedented way,\u201d Sanders argued. Biden may not be able to realize his biggest health care aims, wrote Lanhee Chen, citing a lack of enough GOP support for a public option or lowering the Medicare eligibility age. But \u201cBiden may be able to work with moderate Republicans to extend coverage under the Affordable Care Act, a law that the Supreme Court seems unlikely to overturn anytime soon, if ever,\u201d Chen observed. \u201cBiden is inheriting a national crisis that has built up over 40 years,\u201d economist Jeffrey D. Sachs wrote, tracing today\u2019s stark inequality in America back to January 20, 40 years ago, when President Ronald Reagan said in his Inaugural address: \u201cGovernment is not the solution to our problem; government is the problem.\u201d \u201cPresident Donald Trump continued this approach \u2014 passing massive tax cuts in 2017, and then, when calamity hit with Covid-19 in 2020, placing the burden of response on the states. It is Biden\u2019s historic task to reverse Reagan\u2019s \u2014 and Trump\u2019s \u2014 reckless radicalism,\u201d wrote Sachs. Dean Obeidallah: What if Twitter had banned Trump sooner?

Ashley M. Jones, who directs the Magic City Poetry Festival in Birmingham, Alabama, and is the author of several poetry collections, wrote that Gorman\u2019s success made her feel \u201caffirmed in my belief that art is the thing that has been and will keep saving us.\u201d \u201cWhat is so important to me, a Black Southern woman who writes her authentic truth in verse,\u201d Jones observed \u201cis the incredible door Gorman is opening and will keep opening for us in poetry. As I watched her, gorgeous as she is, walking up to that inaugural podium\u201d her red headband \u201clike a crown, in her striking yellow coat \u2014 a sun only mirrored by the light emanating from her \u2014 I was so proud of Amanda Gorman.\u201d \u201cMaybe a poem won\u2019t literally pass legislation or deflect a bullet from exploding in my Black body, but a poem is what makes our hearts move. It does make people think, reflect, and it can even lead to empathy. We need that.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Thomas Weber is professor of history and international affairs at the University of Aberdeen and author most recently of \u201cBecoming Hitler: The Making of a Nazi\u201d (Basic Books). Follow him on Twitter at @thomas__weber. The views expressed in this commentary belong to the author. View more opinion at CNN. Over the last five years, I have often wondered how political analysts who have compared Donald Trump\u2019s presidency to the rise of Nazi Germany would feel if a time machine sent them to Berlin in 1933. They would be stunned by the differences between then and now. Unfortunately, there are no signs of these comparisons abating anytime soon. In the wake of the attack on the US Capitol, alarmists warning of a fascist America have gone into overdrive. In a video he shared on Twitter, Arnold Schwarzenegger told us that the January 6 insurrection \u201cwas the Day of Broken Glass right here in the United States.\u201d The action hero-turned-politician described the infamous anti-Jewish pogrom that presaged the Holocaust as \u201ca night of rampage\u2026carried out in 1938 by the Nazi equivalent of the Proud Boys.\u201d His message: America\u2019s Night of the Broken Glass and \u201cselfishness and cynicism,\u201d if left unchallenged, could spiral out of control and bring democracy down. Schwarzenegger\u2019s message is noble, but the reference to Nazi Germany is a misguided one. The Night of the Broken Glass did not bring democracy down. That had already happened half a decade earlier. It was not carried out by the 1930s version of the Proud Boys \u2013 it was a state-organized attack that resulted in 30,000 Jews being arrested and sent to concentration camps. And \u201cselfishness and cynicism\u201d had not paved the path to the pogrom. Schwarzenegger\u2019s intervention is a classic example of the historical record of European fascism being rewritten to fit political messages that warn against Donald Trump. The underlying message behind invocations of Europe\u2019s dark past is clear: Trumpism is fascism, and, even under Joe Biden\u2019s presidency, it is here to stay. Of course, there is some overlap between fascism and Trumpism, particularly in the use of demagoguery and the promise to restore the glory of the nation. While this overlap is well worth exploring, the alarmists who have performed public \u2018Gotcha!\u2019 dances every time Trump has used the playbook of demagoguery have missed one obvious point: All fascists are demagogues, but not all demagogues are fascists. Ignoring this crucial point blinds us to the real danger the core of Trumpism poses to democracy even with Trump out of the White House. These Trump pardons spell the biggest threat As I said in an interview immediately after Trump was elected in 2016, \u201cMy advice would really be to point out what is dangerous about Trump and a presidency of Donald Trump. By invoking Hitler, you run the risk that people will just somehow try to prove that Trump is not Hitler, and if Trump isn\u2019t Hitler than everything will be fine. My point is, Trump isn\u2019t Hitler, but things won\u2019t be fine.\u201d After four years, one may also add: Trumpism isn\u2019t fascism, but things won\u2019t be fine. Beyond their shared strategy of stirring up resentment, appealing to popular prejudices and peddling lies, Trump and Hitler are most similar in how they view the state of nature. Both would likely agree, if the world was left to its own devices, dog-eat-dog anarchy would reign supreme. Yet Trump and Hitler fundamentally differ in their conclusions on how to respond to this nature. Hitler thought the state of nature could and should be overcome, and that a strong and total state was the tool to do so. In keeping with fascist thinking, his starting point was that the pursuit of individual self-interest is poisonous to overcoming the state of nature. For fascists, individuals can only thrive as part of a collective, held together through common kinship and ideology and organized through a strong state. Trump\u2019s starting point is the exact opposite. For him, the pursuit of individual self-interest is paramount to all human existence. For Trump, it seems this pursuit is the glue that holds an intricate web of relationships together. Adhering to this principle is what helps manage the state of nature \u2013 both within and between states \u2013 even if it can\u2019t be overcome. The core of Trump\u2019s political philosophy is that the ruthless pursuit of individual self-interest allows people to thrive both individually and collectively. Kinship beyond family, ideology and the state \u2013 unlike in fascism \u2013 only exist in a transactional sense meant to remove any obstacles to the unobstructed pursuit of self-interest. A goodbye letter for the anti-President This may be why notions of service, sacrifice and heroism seem incomprehensible to Trump. During a 2017 visit to Arlington National Cemetery, Trump reportedly said: \u201cI don\u2019t get it. What was in it for them?\u201d (The White House called the report \u201cfalse\u201d and Trump issued a denial on Twitter). Hitler\u2019s discussion of the role of the state in Mein Kampf rejects the Trumpian pursuit of self-interest and personal enrichment. \u201cThe State,\u201d Hitler wrote, \u201chas nothing whatsoever to do with a definite conception of economics or development of economics.\u201d Hitler did not think the state\u2019s primary function was to drive the economy; instead, he considered the state as the great facilitator that would allow the German \u201cracial\u201d community to flourish collectively. Donald Trump, meanwhile, acted as if the state only existed as a transactional tool that he could wield at his will. It seems he was repeatedly baffled by the discovery that he did not have unlimited executive power but was bound by the Constitution and laws. He never seemed to comprehend that he needed to follow process in exercising power. When the Supreme Court justices he appointed, Vice President Mike Pence and Attorney General William Barr upheld the Constitution, rather than do as he wished, Trump took it personally and considered Pence\u2019s refusal to overturn the election a betrayal. In Trump\u2019s world, letting him down personally also meant letting down and destroying all of America. Hitler and Trump, along with fascism and Trumpism, are all destructive to liberal democracy but in fundamentally different ways. Taking these distinctions seriously allows us better to understand the specific threat Trump posed and be better equipped to spot the warning signs of someone who might follow in his footsteps. Displaying a poor understanding of history, making faulty comparisons and crying wolf at the faintest signs of fascism could lead the world to become anesthetized to dangerous leaders when they actually try to use Hitler\u2019s playbook to consolidate their own power. There is another reason why it is important not to conflate Trump and Hitler, or Trumpism and fascism. In order for the US to heal, Americans need a clear-eyed view \u2013 not at \u201cwhat stands between us / But what stands before us,\u201d to quote Amanda Gorman\u2019s beautiful inaugural poem. However, it is impossible to get to that point without first rebuilding mutual trust.  Trust in each other \u2013 the most important prerequisite in rebuilding America \u2013 can only be reestablished if people are not showered with false accusations. If people have supported a bumbling emperor with no clothes for the last four years, we will not get through to them by calling them fascists. Yet, if we identify with clinical precision what is wrong with Trumpism \u2013 rather than using the label of fascism where it does not apply \u2013 all the while treating his supporters with empathy, we might have a shot at slowly rebuilding trust. And this trust is what will allow both sides of the political divide to engage in conversations about how supporting Trump, even if he is not a fascist, still brought the country to the verge of democratic breakdown. As we attempt to rebuild trust in each other, we need to do one more thing. It is time we turn to history to identify ways to heal our democracy and apply them to the digital age. What does history tell us about how can we heal our democracy? Due to our love of studying how things blew up, we know surprisingly little about how societies rebuild. If there\u2019s anything Trump taught us, it\u2019s how fragile our democracy is, even at the hands of a largely incompetent strongman. It is time we start doing the hard work of repairing our democracy.",

            "article_content": "CNN Opinion contributors react to the most memorable moments of Inauguration Day. The views expressed in these commentaries are their own. Was it all just a dream? As I gathered my family to watch the historic swearing in of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris, the occasion took on a surreal feeling. There were Barack and Michelle Obama, looking like they hadn\u2019t aged a day. And there was George W. Bush, elbowing hello to his old friends. And the Clintons, who in some ways, never seem to have left Washington DC. It was a throwback to an earlier era, an era before \u201cAmerican carnage.\u201d Gone were the anger and division. No one suggested America needed to be made great again. The air of fraught anxiety had lifted. Even the US Capitol building didn\u2019t show the scars of its insurrection just two weeks ago. If not for the masks, and the modest number of assembled guests, it could have been a scene from a decade ago. It was almost as if none of it really happened. Except, of course it did. The last four years have tattooed a trauma on so many Americans, and it won\u2019t fade overnight. There\u2019s healing to do, and Biden has a long journey ahead. But at least for an hour or so at the United States Capitol, there was finally a much-needed respite from the madness, the moment of demarcation that will forever be 2020 \u2013 nostalgia for the before, and hopefulness in the after. SE Cupp is a CNN political commentator. On Inauguration Day, we witnessed the triumph of American democracy. This month we\u2019ve seen two very different symbols in the Capitol. On January 6, we watched insurrectionists strut through that building with the Confederate flag. Now here we are. Just two weeks later, Kamala Harris got sworn in as vice president \u2013 the first woman and third person of color to do so. So, whose century is it? Does it belong to the people who are trying to recapture something they\u2019ve lost? Or is there something new happening? I believe it\u2019s the latter. Are there cracks? Absolutely. Is there division? Of course. But let\u2019s be clear: we just hit the biggest reset button in history. After four years of horror, America just got a gigantic beauty download. And beauty matters. It heals. Every person in a position of power knows they\u2019re talking to a different country today than they were yesterday. And for those who spent the last four years spewing nonsense, they know they can no longer do it and get away with it. They feel constrained by what they just saw, and the fact that \u2013 from Silicon Valley to Black voters in the South \u2013 this country stuck together. We want something different. Today we heard our President, Joe Biden, speak from the depth of his soul. There was not one part of his speech that didn\u2019t feel like medicine. He acknowledged and honored the cry for racial justice, 400 years in the making. He reached out to young people and people who are suffering. He promised to be a President for all Americans. Best of all: while this Inauguration is historic and full of firsts, the day has felt refreshingly normal. After surviving the past four years, boring is the new thrilling. Van Jones, a CNN host, is the CEO of the REFORM Alliance, a criminal justice organization It was an inauguration like none in living memory. There was a big first: The first woman, first African American and first Asian American was sworn in as Vice President. And there was a stark challenge: to inaugurate a new president at a moment of profound national vulnerability, after our democracy barely survived a domestic attack and when over 400,000 Americans did not survive a deadly virus. President Joe Biden met the challenge. Watching the pomp of the inaugural tradition, I was struck by the new meaning carried by the same words we hear every four years. When Lady Gaga performed the Star-Spangled Banner and sang, \u201cand our flag was still there,\u201d my heart caught in my throat \u2014 what a thing to take for granted, that our flag would always be there; what a call to gratitude, to note that yes, even after a mob tore down the stars and stripes and tried to replace it with the banner of an authoritarian, today, our nation\u2019s flag flies. We did not have a peaceful transition of power. But we did transition from an administration that ruled with vindictiveness, cruelty and prejudice to one that leads with sincerity, optimism and openness. Yes, inaugurations are performances. But this one told the world that while America was bowed by the Trump administration and by attacks from his supporters, we remain, as inaugural poet Amanda Gorman put it, \u201cA nation that isn\u2019t broken, but simply unfinished.\u201d As Gorman read her extraordinary poem, \u201cThe Hill We Climb,\u201d she embodied the best of America: \u201cA skinny black girl, descended from slaves,\u201d she said, who dreamed of being president and was on stage to inaugurate one. A young woman who understands that this nation was not made perfect, but believes we can make it better. As the relief and ceremony of today recedes and the real work begins, her final lines offer a kind of North Star to orient us as we walk out of the darkness: There is always light. If only we are brave enough to see it. If only we are brave enough to be it.

As a conservative Republican, I am under no illusion that I\u2019ll be happy with most of what Joe Biden does as President. A few of his expected executive orders and appointments have already given me great concern that his calls for unity are just words to cover up an unwillingness to say no to the more fringe left elements of his base. But as an American, I am glad for today as it showed, ultimately, that our system held. It was strained, particularly in the last few weeks by Donald Trump\u2019s disgraceful handling of the post-election period, but we now have a new President, a new Congress and a chance, as we do every two years, to begin anew following a free and fair election. There is relative equilibrium in Washington, with a tilt to the Democrats. Despite not controlling anything, though, Republicans do have an important role to play in guiding the country\u2019s future. There is an urgent need for both parties to unify over two things: distributing the coronavirus vaccine to as many Americans as possible, as fast as possible, and standing against the scourge of political violence. These are crucial matters. We can\u2019t get back to normal life in America unless we get the vaccine to her people, and our democracy will be further imperiled if we look the other way when anyone \u2013 anyone \u2013 participates in or incites violence as a means to subverting the will of the people. We are all in this together, and that means accepting that our electoral system produces winners\u2026 and losers. It is an urgent matter for all Republicans to hear this message: we lost, but we can win again as long as we let go of the conspiracy theories that have driven too many people absolutely bonkers. I wish President Joe Biden well and pray for his success. And I hope for a Republican Party that becomes a loyal opposition and presents itself as a viable, responsible governing alternative in the coming elections, even as it helps President Biden tackle the clear and present dangers to the American way of life.

Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris together. I know exactly how she felt. For so many years now, I\u2019ve been angry at America. Ashamed of my country. Disgusted at the unrelenting hate and ignorance many of us have spread around the world. But watching the inauguration today, I had so many reasons to be happy and full of pride for my nation. I\u2019m proud of the record numbers of Americans who turned out to vote, despite the deadly risk of Covid-19. Proud to see Vice President Kamala Harris, our first woman and first Black Vice President. Watching record numbers of Black Americans who when confronted with unimaginable horrors and injustice, refused to be intimidated and who instead, used their power to sway the presidential election \u2013 that makes my heart proud. Together, we even shifted the balance of power in the US Senate. We stood up, spoke up, ran for office and convinced our allies and people around the world that Black lives must matter. That equal justice must matter. Today a majority of Americans rejected the politics of White power and insurrectionist ideas. And for the first time in four years, I\u2019m comfortable sitting down with my White neighbor from Kentucky and singing \u201cAmazing Grace\u201d together with hope in our hearts for America. \u201cWeeping may endure in the night, but joy comes in the morning,\u201d President Biden said, quoting from the Bible, in his inaugural speech. Amen. Roxanne Jones, a founding editor of ESPN Magazine and former vice president at ESPN, has been a producer, reporter and editor at the New York Daily News and The Philadelphia Inquirer.

Four years after his predecessor thundered about \u201cAmerican carnage,\u201d President Joe Biden gave an inauguration speech that was pragmatic, thoughtful and, most of all, optimistic. He acknowledged the insurrection at the Capitol that took place just two weeks ago, the deadly Covid-19 pandemic and the deeply divided state of our nation.  But he offered a welcome antidote to such crises. \u201cUnity is the path forward,\u201d he said, noting that \u201cdisagreement must not lead to disunion.\u201d Biden pledged to \u201cfight as hard for those who did not support [him] as for those who did.\u201d This olive branch of healing seemed especially gracious given his predecessor\u2019s refusal to participate in the normal rituals surrounding the peaceful transfer of power. Biden\u2019s speech was effective because his words were from the heart. This was no small feat in this unusual, socially distanced inauguration that was equal parts somber and celebratory. Biden promised that \u201cWe will get through this together.\u201d His call for basic decency towards one another made him look far stronger and more presidential than Donald Trump, who left office looking like a petulant child. Even before Biden was sworn in, it was profoundly moving when Justice Sonia Sotomayor \u2013 the country\u2019s only Latina Supreme Court Justice \u2013 administered the oath of office to Vice President Kamala Harris. Seeing these two women of color on the national stage was powerful. And Jennifer Lopez singing \u201cThis Land Is Your Land\u201d and \u201cAmerica the Beautiful\u201d was a welcome reminder than Latinos are indeed woven into the fabric of the United States.  After four years of an administration that was so hostile to Latinos and immigrants, hearing JLo recite a few lines of the pledge of allegiance in Spanish was a joy. Raul A.

Pro-life Democrats in Congress were marginalized within the party \u2013 dropping from dozens in the 1990s to fewer than four today. In 2008, President Barack Obama described \u201cbitter\u201d voters who \u201ccling to guns or religion,\u201d and \u201cbitter clingers\u201d became an anthem for conservative voters.  In 2012, for the first time, the word \u201cGod\u201d was nowhere to be found in the Democratic platform. But as Christian nationalism has seized the Republican Party, Joe Biden\u2019s inauguration as the 46th President sought to emphasize the theme of unity \u2013 and was filled with what could almost be heard as a repeated invitation for Americans of faith to revisit his political party. On top of the traditional invocation and benediction, Garth Brooks sang \u201cAmazing Grace.\u201d The National Youth Poet Laureate, Amanda Gorman, quoted Micah 4:4. Biden\u2019s speech referenced God four times and faith three times. He quoted directly from the Bible in a passage about loss and mourning \u2013 \u201cWeeping may endure for a night, but joy cometh in the morning\u201d \u2013 a reminder to listeners that the pages of Psalm 30 are no doubt well-worn in his bible. Not all Democrats agree that their political party should embrace religion or the religious. Pro-life Democrats are still an endangered species. And even some Trump-skeptics wonder whether the Biden administration will renew the hostility toward religious Americans \u2013 like the Little Sisters of the Poor \u2013 that some considered one of the most divisive aspects of the Obama administration. But in his last speech as President, Donald Trump didn\u2019t emphasize God or faith. Revealing his true priorities, some of his last acts as president included pardoning Steve Bannon, who was indicted last year for defrauding many of Trumps\u2019 own supporters, and revoking his previous executive order that would have barred members of his administration from immediately becoming lobbyists. In addition to leaving the Republican Party fractured and divided, Trump also gave Democrats one last parting gift: the chance to win back some of America\u2019s religious voters to their side of the aisle.

The inauguration of Joe Biden as the 46th President of the United States promises a new birth of American freedom. Race proved central to Biden\u2019s inauguration address \u2013 as it should be. He quoted President Abraham Lincoln twice and became the first president to ever acknowledge White supremacy in an inaugural address. \u201cThis is our historic moment of crisis and challenge,\u201d said Biden. One that could only be met through unity and national purpose. \u201cThis is democracy\u2019s day, a day of history and hope, of renewal and resolve,\u201d Biden observed. He touted his victory as not a personal one, but as a reflection of the power of American democracy. Biden acknowledged the White riot at the nation\u2019s Capitol as a preface to words that called Americans to an aspirational citizenship \u2013 bold enough to defeat the forces of racial and political division that have threatened so many of us under the Trump administration. Biden celebrated the historic election of Vice President Kamala Harris as proof that the arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice. He spoke of the ongoing devastation of the Covid-19 pandemic, but never lost the thread of racial justice, noting in a reference to a poem by Langston Hughes that \u201cthe dream of racial justice will be deferred no longer\u201d and observing that the rise of \u201cWhite supremacy\u201d and racial terror would be confronted and defeated. Biden echoed the words of President Abraham Lincoln in his vow that his \u201cwhole soul\u201d would be committed to national political unity. Such unity must be based on listening to one another, respecting political disagreement, rejecting conspiracy theories and the spread of lies and false narratives that have undermined democracy. The President\u2019s stirring introduction of his personal and political hopes for the nation centered empathy, respect and understanding in a speech that placed the struggle for racial justice as the beating heart of America\u2019s wounded democracy. The President\u2019s words proved revelatory and compassionate. Now the nation awaits deeds to make those hopes real. Peniel E.

He is the author of several books, most recently, \u201cThe Sword and the Shield: The Revolutionary Lives of Malcolm X and Martin Luther King Jr.\u201d In recent years, four different presidents \u2014 George HW Bush, Bill Clinton, George W. Bush and Barack Obama \u2014 have issued inspirational calls for national unity in their first inaugural address. As John Harris pointed out in Politico this week, each has fallen short of success. Perhaps in the flow of relief as Joe Biden took the reins today, I am in a bit of a swoon. But I came away from his inaugural address thinking we may finally have a president who can pull us back from the brink. There is something about the man that is compelling \u2014 the fire in his soul, his humility, his clear moral purpose. Most political leaders develop a strong exterior. Biden is one of the few who has cultivated a strong interior. Biden recognizes that words alone will not bring healing. To win over the millions who have been poisoned to believe he is illegitimate, he and his team will have to bring concrete results \u2014 taming the pandemic, reinvigorating the economy and the like.  And in order to get those results, he will need some political support from Republicans. So the path ahead is steep. Still, Biden has seemingly emerged as the best possible leader for these perilous times.

The backdrop could not have seemed bleaker: the event ringed by the National Guard, the crowd shrunk by the Covid-19 pandemic, the echoes of the insurrection still vibrating through the Capitol. And yet, the inauguration of President Joe Biden and Vice President Kamala Harris could not have been a more hopeful event. Rooted in the tragedy and destruction of the past several years, Biden\u2019s inaugural address did not shy away from naming the challenges facing the US \u2013 what he called \u201ca time of testing.\u201d hHe talked about the threat of political extremism and domestic terrorism, of White supremacy and climate change, of the unchecked pandemic. But in his inaugural, Biden found the thread of hope. He found it on the stage, where the first Black, first Asian and first woman vice president had just been sworn in by the first Latina Supreme Court Justice. He found it in the nation\u2019s history: in the need for racial justice, in women\u2019s fight for the vote. And he found it in hard truths: that \u201cdemocracy is fragile,\u201d and that if we turn toward decency, unity and healing, we will be able to say that \u201cdemocracy and hope, truth and justice did not die on our watch but thrived.\u201d It is more a wish than a guarantee, a reminder that democracy must be fought for every day, that it is inherently fragile. But seeing a president commit his administration to that core work is reason to believe that American carnage can be transformed into something different \u2013 even, perhaps, a period of democratic renewal.

For Biden, this day is about the \u201ccause of democracy.\u201d He vowed to be a president for \u201call Americans.\u201d The most important element of his promise came down to unity. President Biden promised that he would listen to everyone and that, even when people disagreed, it was necessary to have conversations. That is how democracy works. The inaugural address followed through on the major themes that have defined his entire run for office. He wants to tell a story of unity and not division. \u201cPolitics doesn\u2019t have to be a raging fire, destroying everything in its path,\u201d Biden said. \u201cEvery disagreement doesn\u2019t have to be a cause for total war. And we must reject the culture in which facts themselves are manipulated and even manufactured.\u201d To achieve this goal, the President faces an awesome task ahead. He will have to contend with a radicalized Republican Party that will have little interest in negotiation, let alone compromise. As he saw on January 6, and during the Obama years, the modern Republican Party has shifted far to the right and most leaders are not willing to break from the party line. They have engaged in a level of toxic, smashmouth partisanship that renders Biden\u2019s style of governing difficult to achieve. He also must preside in a media ecosystem that has created too much room for sensationalism, partisan journalism and falsehood. In a world of fragmented and uncontrolled information, it won\u2019t be easy getting out his message. The space that we depend on to obtain our facts about politics does not unite us; it stokes division. Can a president transform the basic institutional dynamics of American politics? The odds are low. But at least, unlike his predecessor, this President wants to give it a try. This was the opposite of  his predecessor\u2019s American Carnage speech. After the horrific events of January 6, this should be welcome relief to all Americans who want to get us to a better place.

President Joe Biden \u2013 those very words sound soothing to me\u2013 is now in office after the longest four years in Americans\u2019 living memory. In this unique match of man and moment, the American people finally have reason to hope. Biden\u2019s inaugural speech and the entire ceremony embodied a welcomed promise of truth, kindness, decency, competence and  selflessness that was so painfully absent from the outgoing administration\u2019s White House. From the arrival of leaders of both parties, to the swearing in of Vice President Kamala Harris, to the resplendent only-in-America diversity on stage, to Biden\u2019s speech beseeching the country to come together, the inauguration of the 46th President was a balm for a wounded nation. The one who chose to stay away was not missed. Biden\u2019s speech was down to Earth, genuine. It wasn\u2019t flowery or pretentious; it was sincere and moving. \u201cThis is democracy\u2019s day,\u201d he declared, and who could disagree after the country managed to survive a coup attempt in that same building exactly two weeks before? This, after the outgoing president tried to overturn the result of a democratic election. America\u2019s recent trials only strengthened Biden\u2019s message.  He knows the truth. He understands that after four years of acrimony and lies, his earnest call for unity can sound na\u00efve.  \u201cI know speaking of unity can sound to some like a foolish fantasy these days,\u201d he said. \u201cI know that the forces that divide us are deep and they are real.\u201d But his faith in the country is strong and, he hopes, contagious. The whole world was watching. One of my acquaintances on Twitter from Saudi Arabia gushed, \u201cthe greatest nation on earth is back.\u201d Can he persuade Americans as well? Biden proved that it\u2019s possible to be uplifting and optimistic without lying \u2013 without holding back harsh realities. Despite this \u201cwinter of peril,\u201d as he called it, it\u2019s hard to avoid the sense that because of this match of man and moment, America is now in pretty good hands.

The pomp and circumstance of the inaugural proceedings reminds us that despite a deadly pandemic, racial strife, political disagreement and a deadly mob whose goal was to prevent inauguration from happening, we can still come together to celebrate and honor the peaceful transition of power in our democracy. Today was a celebration of our national story. It wasn\u2019t a celebration that sought to cover over all the problems we face as a country, or one that ignored the painful days we\u2019ve been through. But it was an occasion for us to take a collective breath as a nation and look ahead toward what we all hope are better days to come. Joe Biden gave a unifying speech that I will remember for his call to \u201cend this uncivil war\u201d that threatens to tear our country apart. If our new president is able to do as he says and restore even some respect to the very real debates we are sure to have with one another, he will have been a success. I will not agree with many of the policies that Joe Biden will embrace as president. But, as he noted, this disagreement does not have to make us disagreeable. Indeed, I pray earnestly that President Biden will be able to achieve what he promised to do in his inaugural address: to bring us together, lead us out of this dim chapter in our nation\u2019s history, and to be a president for all Americans.

A faithful Catholic, Joe Biden began his day by going to mass with congressional leaders from both parties. Today is the Second Wednesday of Ordinary Time in the church\u2019s liturgical calendar. This means we are past the Christmas season, and not yet approaching Easter. But most Americans, no doubt, are hoping that we are in fact entering, if not ordinary time, perhaps a less tragic, less turbulent, less trying time. President Joseph Biden is the embodiment of Ernest Hemingway\u2019s maxim that, \u201cThe world breaks everyone and afterward many are strong in the broken places.\u201d He has buried a wife and an infant daughter, then an adult son. He has come back from two failed presidential campaigns, and humiliating defeats early on in the 2020 caucuses and primaries. And he is stronger at the broken places. Another son of Scranton, the late Pennsylvania Gov. Bob Casey, Sr., who had known his share of setbacks, used to tell me, \u201cthe view from the canvas is highly educational.\u201d And Biden got a Ph.D. on the canvas. In her remarkable speech to the Democratic convention last summer, Dr. Jill Biden told us how being tempered by tragedy prepared her husband for the terrible challenges of our time: \u201cHow do you make a broken family whole?\u201d she asked. \u201cThe same way you make a nation whole: with love and understanding, and with small acts of kindness, with bravery, with unwavering truth.\u201d All of those qualities \u2013 love and understanding, kindness, bravery and unwavering truth \u2013 were present in Bident\u2019s magnificent, magnanimous inaugural address. Speaking with energy, conviction and optimism, Biden made a powerful case for unity, pledging, \u201cMy whole soul is in this.\u201d I believe him. And with Biden\u2019s battle-scarred soul in this, I think the rest of us can dare to dream of a reunited States of America. That would truly make the Biden era an extraordinary time. Paul Begala, a Democratic strategist and CNN political commentator, was a political consultant for Bill Clinton\u2019s presidential campaign in 1992 and served as a counselor to Clinton in the White House. What a difference four years can make. I, like many Americans and allies around the world, breathed a sigh of relief on this historic day as the country turned the page on the era of Trump\u2019s \u201cAmerican carnage\u201d to begin a new chapter in the American story. As newly sworn in President Biden reiterated in his inauguration speech, it\u2019s a story of \u201chope, not fear, of unity not division, of light not darkness.\u201d Biden, at his best a unifier, struck all the right notes as he acknowledged the challenges we face as a country, but also reminded us of the resilience not only of the American people, but also of our democracy itself. He rightly called out the ills of racial injustice, public indecency and untruths and vowed that such forces of darkness would not prevail. Biden reminded us that positive change is possible as he acknowledged the powerful impact of Kamala Harris\u2019 role as the first woman Vice President. This is a moment every American should be incredibly proud of, regardless of what side of the aisle you stand on. The Biden administration is faced with much to repair, but it\u2019s the responsibility of we the people to preserve and protect our fragile democracy. It may have triumphed this time, but it\u2019s up to us to keep it. That work begins anew today.

Standing in front of the Capitol building which was attacked by insurrectionists two weeks ago, President Joe Biden offered a defiant defense of democracy and American unity in a time of division. \u201cThis is democracy\u2019s day, a day of history and hope, of renewal and resolve,\u201d Biden declared in a clear vigorous voice. It was an inaugural address that was a lifetime in the making but tailored to the massive challenges of our time. \u201cI know the forces that divide us are deep and they are real. But I also know they are not new,\u201d Biden said. \u201cOur history has been a constant struggle between the American ideal that we are all created equal, and the harsh ugly reality that racism, nativism, fear, demonization have long torn us apart.\u201d These conflicts between good and evil have taken different forms in different ages, but America has always ultimately forged a more perfect union by listening to the better angels of our nature. Armed with \u201chistory, faith and reason,\u201d he  promised to lead by example toward the \u201cthe way of unity\u2026the most elusive of all things in a democracy.\u201d He repeated his signature campaign pledge to be \u201ca president for all Americans,\u201d cautioning that \u201cdisagreement must not lead to disunion.\u201d Like all great inaugurals, it was an optimistic speech rooted in the new President\u2019s values. Biden spoke as a middle-class man of faith, armed with a half century of experience in government, animated by the belief that America can be both great and good. Declaring that we will \u201cdefend the truth and defeat the lies,\u201d Biden sought to summon the civic and spiritual force of the United States toward the intense array of challenges we face: from disinformation proliferation to the persistence of White supremacy (which gained its first mention in an inaugural address) to the pandemic which has already killed more than 400,000 Americans and still rages. In this \u201cwinter of peril and significant possibilities,\u201d Biden promised no quick fixes but instead the power of steady and honest leadership, committed to the common good. For a country and a Capitol that just endured the most serious domestic attack on our democracy in generations, Biden\u2019s inaugural was met with an almost palpable sense of bipartisan relief by most elected officials in Washington. We now move forward into a new day, together - not na\u00efve about the challenges we face but newly rededicated to the proposition that all Americans are created equal, knowing that our democracy endures and presidential leadership matters. Now the real work of healing \u2013 and governing \u2013 begins. John Avlon is a CNN senior political analyst.",

View more opinion articles on CNN. This year\u2019s holiday honoring Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., happening in the wake of of a White mob\u2019s sacking of the US Capitol and an unprecedented second impeachment of President Donald J. Trump, offers the United States a chance to recover and connect with the most powerful and resonant aspects of America\u2019s apostle of nonviolence. Martin Luther King Jr.\u2019s political life roughly corresponds with the arc of the civil rights movement\u2019s heroic period, between the 1954 Brown v. Board of Education Supreme Court decision mandating desegregation and the 1968 Fair Housing Act, the latter legislation passed just days after King\u2019s assassination in April of that year. This era represents America\u2019s Second Reconstruction, a post-World War II social movement for racial and economic justice. As that movement\u2019s leading political mobilizer and most celebrated figure, King routinely faced off against racist opponents in government, business, church hierarchy and all aspects of American society \u2013 many of whom would probably have stood proudly alongside those who stormed the Capitol. The roots of the White supremacist tree that has flourished in the age of Trump are deep, and King combated these forces in his own time with a moral clarity that turned him into a radical political agitator who broke with his former political ally, President Lyndon B. Johnson, on the issue of Vietnam, and a revolutionary human rights leader who vowed to help end militarism, racism and materialism before it destroyed American society. Many Americans have rightfully expressed shock, horror and anger at images of White rioters at the US Capitol last week creating mayhem that left five dead, including a Capitol Police officer, and the subsequent photos of National Guard troops sleeping on the marble floors of the Capitol rotunda to protect it from further insurrection as members of the House of Representatives debated and then impeached the US President for the second time. Yet it is important, as we approach the King holiday, to face up to the uglier aspects of our recent history, which we continue to ignore at our own national, political and moral peril. King\u2019s political courage in speaking out against racism, poverty, violence and American imperialism in foreign policy shows us a way forward. America needs the revolutionary King now more than ever. While always maintaining his commitment to non-violence, this King stalked the nation like a pillar of fire, an Old Testament prophet both recognized and shunned \u2013 as he does even today, in a nation that has embraced him more in death than in life. During his last revelatory year of political activism and organizing, King demanded a maturity of Americans that we have yet to embrace. A mature nation, suggested King, possessed the grace to look inward, identify and assess its mistakes, and move forward through an examination of a past filled with troubling injustices and glorious instances of progress rooted in social movements that expanded the boundaries of democracy. This year calls us, once again, to seek renewal in what King characterized as \u201cthose great wells of democracy,\u201d not by ignoring our past mistakes but embracing our messily complex history and all of its flaws. By doing so, we will never again be shocked, stunned or surprised at assaults on democracy that are deeply rooted in a failure to recognize how America\u2019s past continues to shape its present and to imagine that things can truly be different. What we can learn from Martin Luther King Jr.'s crisis of faith King preached his last Sunday sermon in Washington, DC against a growing backdrop of racial and civil unrest that bears a striking resemblance to our own. In King\u2019s era, Richard Nixon, George Wallace and Barry Goldwater all vied to achieve political power by galvanizing White voters fearful that gains for Black Americans meant a loss of prestige, privilege and power for Whites. In his rise to power, President Trump turned racially based appeals directed at a long-simmering base of angry White voters into a political art, one that fueled a racially divisive movement that has threatened the very citadel of American democracy. There is a striking parallel between 1968 and 2021. In both instances the nation has found itself at a political crossroads defined by ongoing debate and struggle between building a beloved community or retaining a status quo grounded in racial injustice, economic inequality and the marginalization of groups lacking in privilege and power. In 1968, America chose Nixon\u2019s \u201claw and order\u201d over Martin Luther King Jr.\u2019s dream of multiracial democracy \u2013 choosing to build systems of punishment that disproportionately undermined Black lives rather than investing in reforms that would promote justice and equity. The Capitol attack was White supremacy, plain and simple The attempted coup at the Capitol, in profoundly disturbing ways, represents the bitter fruits of a harvest of racial division whose immediate historic antecedents were visible after King\u2019s death. Yet in modern America King\u2019s contemporary legacy abounds. On January 5, 2021 Reverend Raphael Warnock, who presides over King\u2019s former pulpit at Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta, became the first Black person elected to the US Senate from Georgia. Dr. King\u2019s call at the March on Washington for Georgia and the rest of the nation to look beyond the embarrassment of Stone Mountain\u2019s dedication to White supremacy and the Confederacy resonated clearly through Georgia in last year\u2019s presidential election and two Senate run-offs earlier this month. The revolutionary King bluntly confronted the challenges to his dream of transforming the nation into a beloved community. \u201cIt is an unhappy truth that racism is a way of life for the vast majority of white Americans, spoken and unspoken, acknowledged and denied, subtle and sometimes not so subtle \u2013 the disease of racism permeates and poisons the body politic,\u201d he observed during his brilliantly provocative Passion Sunday sermon at Washington\u2019s National Cathedral on March 31, 1968. Jesse Jackson: Losing MLK 'hurts all the time,' but we fight on This is the King many would rather conveniently forget, especially those conservatives who insist on using his words in defense of White supremacy. The White riot at the Capitol reminds us that King\u2019s warnings about racism\u2019s dangers to American democracy continue in our own time. This most recent assault on democracy has rightfully been compared to the rise of White supremacy during America\u2019s First Reconstruction, the fitful period following racial slavery and the Civil War, where efforts to guarantee Black citizenship, dignity, and voting rights existed uneasily alongside racial terror, voter suppression and Jim Crow laws that innovated racial segregation as a matter of local and state preferences, ungoverned by the Constitution. Yet last week\u2019s insurrection, which included the striking image of a rioter holding a Confederate flag in the Capitol, echoes large aspects of the violent opposition that King faced in his own era. The rise of White Citizens Councils comprised of leading Southern civic, clergy and business leaders, in the wake of court-ordered school desegregation sparked what came to be known as \u201cMassive Resistance\u201d against Black citizenship and dignity. Massive resistance became a euphemism for White supremacy, and the White Citizens Council put an officious image on racist sentiments that found common ground with the Ku Klux Klan and other more clandestine racial terror groups.  This generation of Americans has an opportunity to choose a different path. It is one that may very well be more difficult than we would like to imagine, since it is a road the nation has yet to embark on. The greatest testament to Dr. King\u2019s legacy this year will be in the collective effort to reimagine an America that is mature enough to explain the events of the last year and this one, not as a mere pit stop on the road to democratic perfection or an aberration on an otherwise healthy body politic. King would surely shy away from using his holiday as an example of American exceptionalism \u2013 and would instead push us toward the hard work of building, for the first time in our nation\u2019s history, a racially inclusive democracy that will ensure that this latest attack on the sacred citadel of American democracy will be the last.",

Last week, Donald Trump Jr. reacted to Twitter\u2019s decision to ban his father from the social media platform with a tweet of his own: \u201cWe are living Orwell\u2019s 1984. Free-speech no longer exists in America. It died with big tech and what\u2019s left is only there for a chosen few.\u201d Minutes earlier, Josh Hawley \u2013 the Missouri senator and outspoken proponent of Trump\u2019s false claims to have won the 2020 election, who offered a raised fist to those assembled outside the Capitol, just hours before the mob turned violent and forcibly breached the building\u2019s defenses \u2013 had responded to the news that Simon & Schuster had decided to cancel his book contract with a tweet. \u201cThis could not be more Orwellian\u201d he wrote. \u201cOnly approved speech can now be published. This is the Left looking to cancel everyone they don\u2019t approve of. I will fight this cancel culture with everything I have.\u201d On Wednesday, Anthony Shaffer, retired military intelligence officer and adviser to the Trump campaign, accused the BBC\u2019s Evan Davis of using \u201cOrwellian language to change what happened\u201d when Davis described the president \u201cinspiring insurrection, sedition, violent attack on Congress.\u201d Orwell opposed censorship, not only official state censorship, which was \u201cobviously \u2026 not desirable,\u201d but the informal censorship of the media. As he wrote in an unpublished 1943 essay on \u201cThe Freedom of the Press\u201d: \u201cIf publishers and editors exert themselves to keep certain topics out of print, it is not because they are frightened of prosecution but because they are frightened of public opinion. In this country intellectual cowardice is the worst enemy a writer or journalist has to face.\u201d Yet, while Orwell opposed censorship, he abhorred the corruption of language by political leaders intent on masking dubious or amoral actions behind either the anodyne language of bureaucracy and legalese, or the emotional language of patriotism.  One of Orwell\u2019s deepest laments was that, during his lifetime, \u201cpolitical speech and writing\u201d had become \u201clargely the defense of the indefensible.\u201d Most likely Orwell would not have supported either the de-platforming of Trump, or the cancelation of Hawley\u2019s book contract. But he likely would also have despised both men for their cynical abuse of the English language. More straightforward would have been his reaction to Shaffer\u2019s disingenuous effort to invoke his name to delegitimize the BBC\u2019s characterization of the events of January 6. In his classic 1946 essay \u201cPolitics and the English language,\u201d Orwell wrote that \u201cPolitical language \u2013 and with variations this is true of all political parties, from Conservatives to Anarchists \u2013 is designed to make lies sound truthful and murder respectable, and to give an appearance of solidity to pure wind.\u201d The term Orwellian, used correctly, is a shorthand for the perversion of language to mask truth and defend the indefensible, the most concise example of which is the government\u2019s mantra in Orwell\u2019s \u201c1984\u201d: \u201cWar is peace. Freedom is slavery. Ignorance is strength.\u201d \u201c1984,\u201d in addition to being an indictment of totalitarianism, is also an indictment of the displacement of plain truth with political doublespeak. It\u2019s a warning of the societal danger of rewriting insurrection, sedition and violence as patriotism and protest. Trump Jr. and Hawley\u2019s tweets rolled into my feed as I was finishing the syllabus for an undergraduate history seminar, \u201cGeorge Orwell and the Making of the Modern World,\u201d which will explore the early 20th century taught through Orwell\u2019s writing. Not for the first time, I was reminded of Orwell\u2019s continued relevance, and more broadly, what his work reveals about the importance of truth and language in political discourse in America and beyond. I teach in the US now, but I taught my first class on Orwell in 2016 in the United Kingdom as that country was consumed by the bitter referendum campaign over whether Britain should leave the European Union. Brexiteers famously campaigned with a giant red bus emblazoned with the slogan \u201cWe send the EU \u00a3350 million a week. Let\u2019s fund our NHS instead.\u201d It was a knowingly false equation, that money \u201csaved\u201d by withdrawal the EU would be directly available for investment at home \u2013 akin to Big Brother\u2019s 2 + 2 =5 in Orwell\u2019s \u201c1984\u201d \u2013 but one that the Remain camp seemed unable to neutralize. The distortions and untruths of the Brexit campaign only underscored the enduring relevance of Orwell\u2019s quip that, \u201cIntellectual honesty is a crime in any totalitarian country; but even in England it is not exactly profitable to speak and write the truth.\u201d Donald Trump Jr.'s revealing holiday video Four years later, I was teaching in America. This time, my students and I were discussing Orwell in the context of a Trump presidency that has frequently been denounced by the left as Orwellian for its embrace of lying and \u201calternative facts,\u201d but also in the context of a newly emergent \u201ccancel culture\u201d on the political left which has been perceived as Orwellian by public figures with far more credibility than Sen. Hawley. I can report that the extremist political rhetoric of the 2020 election campaign as well as the growth of demagoguery and totalitarianism around the globe has only spurred undergraduates\u2019 interest in Orwell; the course I\u2019m finalizing is full and has a waitlist. I first read George Orwell in middle school, during the dying days of the Cold War, when \u201cAnimal Farm\u201d was considered an ideal vehicle to teach American students about the perils of Soviet totalitarianism and to inculcate the virtues of America\u2019s commitment to free speech and the protection of political dissent. I went on to read \u201c1984\u201d in high school English, where my teacher made analogies between Big Brother and Joseph Stalin and the cult of personality and spelled out the connections between Newspeak and Room 101 and Soviet censorship and the torture and repression of the Gulag. The real lesson of Trump's social media silencing Donald Trump Jr. is a year older than I am. Josh Hawley is a year younger. For American children of our generation, the Orwell whom we were taught in high school was a Cold Warrior, an anti-Communist crusader against thought policing and dictatorial repression.  If I had left Orwell behind in high school, I can imagine having sympathy for Trump and Hawley\u2019s claims that their First Amendment rights have been suppressed by a left-wing media establishment they deemed \u201cOrwellian.\u201d  After all, to quote the inscription beside the statue of Orwell outside the BBC\u2019s headquarters in London, \u201cIf liberty means anything at all, it means the right to tell people what they do not want to hear.\u201d But I didn\u2019t leave Orwell behind.  In college, I read Orwell\u2019s indictments of racial oppression, based on his own experience as an imperial officer in Burma, and his writings on unemployment and poverty in Britain and France. Crucially, I read Homage to Catalonia, Orwell\u2019s memoir of his decision to volunteer alongside the Trotskyist POUM party in Spain in defense of the Spanish Republic against Franco\u2019s coup, only to discover that the POUM\u2019s worst enemy was arguably not Franco but the Stalin-backed Republican government which was intent on extinguishing their POUM \u201callies\u201d with physical persecution and vicious propaganda. Orwell\u2019s memoir sought to dispel the propaganda and rehabilitate the POUM\u2019s reputation as champions of democracy. To his dismay, he found that his publisher Victor Gollancz would not publish the book, despite accepting the truth of Orwell\u2019s narrative, for fear of upsetting the Stalin-backed government and undermining the Republican cause.  Orwell, like Hawley, saw his book contract canceled \u2013 and ultimately published the book through a small press that shared his political sympathies. The more Orwell I read when I was young, the more I came to appreciate that, even above freedom of speech, Orwell was dedicated to defending the truth.  In the world of \u201c1984,\u201d where Big Brother insists that 2+2 =5, \u201cfreedom is the freedom to say that two plus two make four.\u201d Published in 1949, Orwell\u2019s \u201c1984\u201d is set, not in Communist Russia, but in Oceania, a dystopian Anglo-American superpower constantly at war with Russia (Eurasia) and China (Eastasia).  In setting his novel in a version of Britain, Orwell is underscoring the point that political repression and dishonesty are not the preserve of Soviet totalitarianism.  The students who are enrolled in my class this spring were born well after the end of the Cold War.  Their interest in Orwell is driven presumably less by his political relevance as an anti-Communist tribune than by the question of whether modern political culture, with its information silos, lies and alternative facts, has become the dystopian nightmare that Orwell envisaged.",

The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion at CNN. This is an historic day for the United States. President Donald J. Trump is now the first president in American history to be impeached twice \u2013 this time for his role in inciting an insurrection on the US Capitol, an abuse of power so egregious that somewhere former President Richard Nixon, disgraced over Watergate, is shaking his head in disbelief. Wednesday\u2019s vote should not be taken lightly. Only three US presidents have been impeached: Andrew Johnson, Bill Clinton and now Trump. But, as House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said at the start of the afternoon\u2019s proceedings, \u201cHe must go. He is a clear and present danger to the nation that we all love.\u201d Although some Republicans will argue that both impeachments were driven by partisanship, in neither instance were Democrats particularly excited about having to spend their time rebuking a sitting president. In 2019, Pelosi had resisted pursuing the first impeachment process, fearing that voting to punish Trump would only embolden his supporters and improve his chances for reelection in 2020. She and many other Democrats further worried that impeaching over findings in Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation of Russia\u2019s meddling in our election or other potential abuses of power would ultimately hurt the party\u2019s standing politically \u2013 even if it was the right thing to do. Hear Pelosi's remarks during impeachment debate Yet, when the details emerged of Trump\u2019s call to the Ukrainian president asking for political dirt on his rival Joe Biden, Pelosi made a difficult decision to pursue charges. She did so knowing that there was little chance of conviction in the Republican-controlled Senate and that the GOP would politicize it for months to come. The second impeachment was not politically convenient either. The vote came at a time when the party would much rather be focused on preparing to help President-elect Joe Biden enact his ambitious economic agenda during his first months in office. Taking on impeachment in the final days of a one-term presidency is just about the last thing that Pelosi or likely any Democrat had in mind as a top priority. Nonetheless, once again believing it was the only right thing to do, they moved forward. Impeachment serves many purposes. Most important, this constitutional process provides a mechanism for Congress to remove a sitting president who has abused his power and poses a danger to the republic he leads. Trump\u2019s abuse of power, which placed and continues to place every member of Congress in grave danger \u2013 as we saw, horrifyingly, last week \u2013 is simply unacceptable. Impeaching Trump isn't enough But impeachment is also a way for Congress to make a firm statement on the historical record about the limits of presidential power. The outrage that drove Wednesday\u2019s vote did not come from partisan anger, at least not exclusively. It came from the feeling that the President\u2019s role in the violent attack on the Capitol was a flagrant abuse of his authority \u2013 and one for which he continues to deny any responsibility. Sadly, even as House members voted, an ongoing threat of further violence loomed. Military and security personnel are stationed in and around Capitol Hill to protect members of Congress from potential future attacks. Meanwhile, FBI reports indicate that more violent protests are being planned at all 50 state capitals and Washington DC. Wednesday\u2019s vote for impeachment creates a precedent for future elected officials when another politician tries to trample constitutional norms and undermine democracy. But, perhaps, most significantly, it marks a turning point: Now we, as a nation, can start to heal from the nightmare that was the Trump presidency. As for the 197 Republicans who voted against impeachment, they will forever have to defend their records. The GOP can talk about the problems with a rushed impeachment process, but in the end their vote represents an acceptance of the erratic and dangerous behavior the President has engaged in since the November election. The perfect symbol of the Trump years If party members want to talk about separating themselves from Trumpism, this vote confirms that they have done just the opposite. Trumpism is Republicanism \u2013 pure and simple. As the presidential train veered off the rails, most Republicans sat right next to Trump and, whether in action  or in silence, encouraged him to speed along. Each impeachment is remembered in different ways. The impeachment of Andrew Johnson generates conversations about the collapse of Reconstruction and the subversion of efforts to achieve racial justice after the Civil War. The near impeachment of Nixon (who resigned instead) has stimulated dialogue about how presidents can dangerously misuse their authority in pursuit of self-interest. And the impeachment of Bill Clinton has become a basis for conversations about the weaponization of the process. Trump\u2019s dual impeachments will likely go down as an acknowledgement of the immense dangers that our republic has found itself in after the radicalization of the Republican Party resulted in a near total abandonment of norms and institutional restraints. When partisanship triumphed over the needs of governance and the health of our democratic institutions, violence ensued. Trump was a president who was willing to say and do almost anything in pursuit of power \u2013 and a majority of the GOP supported him every step of the way.  Although the President will likely complete his final days in office \u2013 as a Senate trial date has yet to be set and it remains unclear if enough Senate Republicans would vote to convict him \u2013 the action by the House won\u2019t be forgotten. Under the direction of Pelosi, a bipartisan majority delineated a much-needed marker for what is not permissible in presidential politics and why certain actions will not be tolerated. The problem is that this won\u2019t be enough. The impeachment is an historic step in the effort to improve the political health of the nation, but it can\u2019t be the last one. The process of strengthening and restoring the system of checks and balances must be a top priority in coming years. Congress must tackle the broken structures and broken norms that allowed Trump to do what he did. Otherwise, we are bound to find ourselves right back where this started just one week ago.",

A period drama set in London of 1813, the show is based on bestselling American novels, and offers a vision of Britain as only Americans could see it. Yet Brits, as enthusiastically as American viewers, have lapped up this soapy fantasy. The show was lucky with its launch date. By late December, America was reeling from post-election crisis to pre-inauguration crisis, its citizens desperate for escapism. But on Christmas Day itself, Brits were in particular need of the magic \u201cBridgerton \u201coffers. Five days earlier, Prime Minister Boris Johnson had abruptly canceled the nation\u2019s promised Christmas relaxation of quarantine regulations. Young people living in London were disproportionately affected, prevented by overnight changes in quarantine zoning from traveling to their families outside the city. So instead of turkey and charades, Britain\u2019s millennials kicked back with Netflix. \u201cBridgerton\u201d offers viewers eight hours of candy-colored entertainment. (For some Brits of my acquaintance, that eight hours constituted their sole Christmas Day activity.) The story of Daphne, a beautiful debutante in Regency London, this is milquetoast Jane Austen fan fiction. There is some weeping and wailing about the possibility of spinsterhood or scandal, but nothing disquieting happens for long to anyone we care about. The chief crisis of our heroine\u2019s life involves her having to choose between a Prince and a Duke. Like the heroine of a fairy tale, Daphne is introduced from the opener as the fairest in the land, singled out by the Queen \u201cof 200 young ladies\u201d as the winner of the debutante beauty pageant, and declared \u201cthe incomparable\u201d by the anonymous gossip columnist Lady Whistledown. She will face challenges \u2013 both these fairy tale deities will temporarily withdraw their favor \u2013 but we know that beauty and charm will always win. Across the street we meet an evil stepmother, Lady Featherington, who primps up her two charmless elder daughters in lurid feathers and belittles her intellectual youngest, Penelope. We know, as surely as we know that only Cinderella\u2019s foot will fit the glass slipper, that these ugly sisters will end the season unmarried. At times of economic pain, big media sells us fairy tales. The 1937 Disney film \u201cSnow White and the Seven Dwarfs,\u201d released to wild success during one of the worst years of the Great Depression, is regularly cited as an example of this phenomenon. When the theorists Theodor Adorno and Max Horkheimer coined the term \u201cculture industry\u201d, they were writing about the ways that big corporates shape our imagination: the Walt Disney Company sold the song \u201cSome Day My Prince Will Come\u201d to millions of young working class women struggling for a better life. For women in 1937, that better life meant marriage and a male breadwinner. Like \u201cSnow White,\u201d \u201cBridgerton\u201d finds British and American viewers at our most despairing. Like \u201cSnow White,\u201d it peddles dreams to a target audience of working class women. Some of the cast and crew of \u201cBridgerton\u201d have tried to claim progressive credentials for their show. Certainly, its racially diverse casting is to be applauded: a major step toward black British actors finally getting a chance to play the great period drama roles they deserve. (Adjoa Andoh, for example, was born to play a Regency Grande Dame). But the happy-ever-after \u201cBridgerton\u201d sells to its female viewers still consists of marriage and men. This is \u201cSnow White\u201d with added orgasms; social conservatism dressed up in progressive breeches. As for breeches and orgasms, why does the Regency world carry such appeal as a period backdrop? There is something culturally specific about this era which is deeply ingrained in contemporary female fantasy. The \u201cBridgerton\u201d TV series is based on Julia Quinn\u2019s bestselling romance novels of the same name. The eight stories which follow Daphne and her siblings form only a part of the expansive Quinn universe. Her devoted fanbase has produced a rich and varied archive of its own fan fiction, much of it more nuanced and perspicacious than the frothy show you\u2019ll find on Netflix. 'Bridgerton's' intimacy coordinator's work not as sexy as you'd think If there is a \u201cfemale gaze,\u201d \u201cBridgerton\u201d is looking to define and cater to it. Sex scenes are shot to appeal to women who date men; they focus almost exclusively on the heaving torsos of Reg\u00e9-Jean Page, who plays Daphne\u2019s love interest Simon, and Jonathan Bailey, who pursues his own panting storylines as Daphne\u2019s promiscuous brother Anthony. Simon is conveniently given a confidante in the person of his muscular boxing trainer, which offers ample opportunity for the two men to bounce about a boxing ring, shirtless and sweating. Is this feminism, or just female friendly? Contemporary culture has long fetishized men in Regency dress (or undress). When the BBC adapted \u201cPride and Prejudice\u201d in 1995, they invented the iconic scene in which Colin Firth, as Mr. Darcy, strips down to his undershirt and dives into a lake on his grounds. As recently as 2016, women lined up in Washington, DC, to view the very same shirt in a display at the Folger Shakespeare Library. What any of it had to do with Shakespeare was unclear. It is a truth universally acknowledged that men who dress like Austen\u2019s heroes are dreamy. Yet if Austen\u2019s heroes are dreamy, they don\u2019t emerge from fairy tales. Women tend to identify with Austen\u2019s heroines, and thus it\u2019s an easy step to find themselves loving Austen\u2019s men. But much of the reason modern women identify with Austen\u2019s heroines that they face real challenges to which 21st century women can still relate. For Austen\u2019s women, marriage is an economic prospect, and often the only economic prospect which allows an escape from poverty \u2013 or at best, lifelong financial dependence on a reluctant relative. That is no longer true for women in the developed world, but their marital and sexual choices still face pressures and scrutiny unique to their sex. \u201cBridgerton,\u201d as a cultural phenomenon encompassing both novels and TV series, seizes on women\u2019s great affection for Austen\u2019s books and shamelessly targets her fan base. Perhaps if you\u2019ve ever identified with Elizabeth Bennett, you\u2019ll fall for any actor in Regency uniform. But while the landscape of Austen is peppered with tragic figures of women who\u2019ve lost out in life, in \u201cBridgerton,\u201d no one we like ever makes a long-term mistake. Marina Thompson, a Featherington country cousin with more wealth than first appears, does have to settle for respectable marriage in the absence of passion. But as she\u2019s already attempted to entrap a naive young man into falsely accepting paternity of her baby, our sympathy is limited. There is cosmic order in her story\u2019s neat ending, far happier than the messy lives of most unmarried pregnant women in the era. Meanwhile Daphne is a more fiscally naive heroine than any in Austen. In the first episode, she scolds her sisters for mocking her social success: \u201cmy success on the marriage mart influences all of your prospects. We will all need to find love one day.\u201d In two sentences, this script has rejected every observation Austen ever made about Regency social norms. For Austen, marriage is an economic bargain in which love has little to do with worldly success; for Daphne it is a popularity contest in which worldly success and love will naturally come together. Daphne does get everything she wants. This includes cajoling her Duke, the dashing Simon, into embracing fatherhood, despite his lifelong wish not to have children. \u201cBridgerton\u201d presents this development as an act of psychological healing by Daphne \u2013 for who would actively choose childlessness, this show suggests, except as a symptom of unresolved childhood trauma? Yet this seeming cure involves a bedroom act that at worst can be called rape, at best reproductive coercion. She forcibly violates his expressed wish to use the (unreliable) withdrawal method. Sexual consent doesn\u2019t cease to matter when it is violated by an attractive young woman. Daphne\u2019s justifications and Simon\u2019s eventual forgiveness send a poor message to anyone trapped in an abusive sexual relationship. None of this is feminist. Daphne\u2019s act perpetuates old stereotypes of women as seed-stealing succubae. Marina\u2019s treatment of Colin similarly signals that men should be careful of women\u2019s deceit. Such conservatism would not have been out of place in the 1930s. Nor would \u201cBridgerton\u201c\u2018s solid heterosexuality. There\u2019s a token gay character who features in a sub-plot to a subplot. When Daphne\u2019s brother Benedict explores London\u2019s art scene, he makes a friend and fleetingly walks in on the man embracing his lover in the side-room of an orgy. But Benedict rushes away to partake instead in a two-woman threesome \u2013 a classic heterosexual male fantasy. Some \u201cBridgerton\u201d fans are hopeful that Daphne\u2019s rebellious sister Eloise may turn out to be a lesbian in later series \u2013 if so, it will be a departure from the novel series. Nonetheless, \u201cBridgerton\u201d gives us escapism, and we need escapism today. If you\u2019re British, the anti-naturalism of this fantasy is particularly obvious. In the show\u2019s opening shots, we are presented with the most famous vistas of the city of Bath \u2013 and yet we\u2019re told we\u2019re in the city of London. Buckingham Palace is shown with unsubtly CGI\u2019d scaffolding. Anachronistic names pop up everywhere \u2013 \u201cNigel\u201d for a Regency aristocrat? Really? \u2013 and instead of period music, Daphne and Simon\u2019s sex scenes are set to stringed orchestrations of Taylor Swift. These aren\u2019t errors, or the business of pedantic historians to dispute. They are features, not bugs. 'Bridgerton's' Queen Charlotte latest to stir Black debate This antipathy towards accuracy doesn\u2019t preclude a sense of historicism. Like the Quinn novels, the dialogue of TV adaptation is peppered with references to popular myths about the Regency era \u2013 in the opening lines, one character suggests the use of lead and arsenic as effective makeup. A handful of genuine references to Regency social history are used and reused over and again:  there incessant mentions of immature characters being \u2018barely out of leading strings\u2019, i.e. Regency baby-walkers. The purpose of such clangers is not historical accuracy: it is to hang a sign reading: We are not in 2020 anymore. \u201cBridgerton\u201d revels in the fantastical nature of its own world building: this is a world of extravagant wigs and crowded parties; a world in catering for a glamorous wedding can be laid on at three days notice; a world which has achieved racial restitution and equality, without any indication of the struggle and trauma taken to achieve this. In a brief expository scene, never referenced once in the rest of the series, Simon\u2019s godmother tells him that racial harmony arrived in Britain after King George chose to marry a black woman. It is as simplistic an idea as any fairy tale \u2013 whatever your view of Queen Charlotte, whose distant African ancestry has in recent years put her cultural identity under the microscope, no racial progress is ever made that fast. One doubts Meghan Markle shares its confidence in royal open-mindedness. But what a wonderful fairy tale for us momentarily to believe possible.  But this is an American fantasy of Britain. Unlike the historical members of the Regency \u201cton,\u201d who reveled in informal nicknames and scatological jokes, our aristocratic siblings use cold and formal language with each other. Fathers and sons perpetuate in cycles of emotional abuse; no one is capable of communicating their emotions. Even the hopeful vision of racial diversity is limited by an American lens: there are no lead actors of South Asian heritage, which is contemporary Britain\u2019s largest ethnic minority. It is also, like most American fantasies of Britain, a conservative fantasy. Our heroines are aristocrats: there are no storylines for servants, no lead character drawn from the working class. As in a fairy tale, happiness is granted to the beautiful and innocent: Lady Featherington and her \u201cugly\u201d daughters end the show outplayed and unhappy. Perhaps this is what we need to get us through 2021, but if so, we are in a very bad place. An earlier version of this op-ed incorrectly referred to a character on \u201cBridgerton\u201d as Andrew. The character\u2019s name is Anthony.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Garry Kasparov is the chairman of the Renew Democracy Initiative and the Human Rights Foundation and a former world chess champion. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion at CNN. As terrible as the events of Jan. 6 were \u2013 and I\u2019m on the record warning of \u201cthe unimaginable\u201d \u2013 I\u2019m going to repeat what I said after Election Day: It\u2019s not over. This battle against anti-democratic extremism didn\u2019t end when a right-wing mob invaded the United States Capitol and five people died, including one police officer. It didn\u2019t end when Twitter and other social media platforms finally muzzled President Donald Trump \u2013 although that was a heavier blow in this fight than most. And it won\u2019t end when Joe Biden is inaugurated on January 20. Beating Trump was an essential step, of course. Four years of his thuggery and demagoguery were enough to bring American democracy to its knees. Four more might have finished it off. Had fewer than 45,000 votes across three key states gone the other way on Election Day, we\u2019d be plunging toward authoritarian rule, and discussing which of Trump\u2019s children would take over in 2024. Narrowly dodging that metaphorical bullet was no protection against the threat of real bullets, as the attack on the Capitol proved. And there will be more violence, especially if the Capitol perpetrators and those who incited them \u2013 starting with the President \u2013 are not held accountable. The correct response is the dispassionate application of the law. Not political persecution, but nor politically motivated leniency, either. We don\u2019t have to choose between unity and justice.  Avoiding doing the right thing will only prolong the crisis and give aid and comfort to enemies of the state and of the peace. Our Founding Fathers failed to resolve the historical challenge of slavery, passing a bloody Civil War on to future generations. Despite Abraham Lincoln\u2019s assassination, Reconstruction allowed the South a \u201cdefeat with honor,\u201d decades of Jim Crow, and the pernicious Lost Cause mythology that persists today. Consider the repugnant image of a Trumpist Capitol invader carrying a Confederate flag in a building that Robert E. Lee and Stonewall Jackson only dreamed of conquering. No new mythology should be allowed to sprout from this vile transgression. The worst result would be letting the mutineers off the hook \u2013 and this includes the elected officials who encouraged them, like Sens. Ted Cruz and Josh Hawley and especially President Trump. That they, and scores of other Republicans, continued to attack the integrity of the election even now is beyond the pale. The perpetrators won\u2019t become heroes or martyrs if the process of justice is not unduly politicized. It would be a blunder for the left to turn a clear case of criminal justice into a battleground for racial justice, which would help the Trumpist Republicans twist their illegal insurrection into the culture war they crave. White supremacy is a terrible evil of American history, and Trump and his followers\u2019 traffic in it is repugnant, but we should not overburden a clear-cut criminal proceeding with the cleansing of sins. Ted Cruz's fight for the man he once called 'sniveling coward' History teaches us the cost of well-meaning but shortsighted attempts to sacrifice justice for unity. Russians learned this in the hardest possible way after the fall of the Soviet Union. As I discussed at length in my book, Winter Is Coming, they declined to root out the KGB security state in the interest of national harmony. It would be too traumatic, our leaders said, to expose the countless atrocities the Soviet security forces committed and to punish their authors. A feeble truth commission was quickly abandoned by President Boris Yeltsin, and soon even the Soviet archives were closed, although not before researchers like Vladimir Bukovsky revealed some of the KGB\u2019s atrocities. The KGB\u2019s name was changed to the FSB and its members quietly stayed in touch and intact. The result? A mere nine years after the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, Russia elected a former KGB lieutenant colonel, Vladimir Putin, to the presidency. It was the last meaningful election we ever had. We chose unity and we got dictatorship. America should not make a similar mistake. The truth may hurt, but lies will do far greater damage in the end. Americans should be prepared for a long fight against these anti-democratic forces. The attack on the Capitol has opened every eye; there can be no more feigned ignorance of the crisis. Many Americans were shocked by how many of their compatriots, including nearly all GOP officials, have been willing to go along with Trump\u2019s open assault on the pillars of their open society, from the free press to fair elections. As I warned early on, demagogues don\u2019t find radicals to lead, they steadily radicalize their followers one outrage at a time. The culmination, so far, was January 6. Hemingway wrote in \u201cFor Whom the Bell Tolls\u201d: \u201cThere are many who do not know they are fascists but will find it out when the time comes.\u201d The time has come, and we are finding them out. Fortuitously, they are inclined to boast of their transgressions on Instagram and from the Senate floor, which makes them easy to find. The question is if the will exists to apply the justice they deserve. Failing to do so will not mollify them. They are living in an alternate universe, where 70% of Republican voters say that Republican lawmakers who tried to stop the certification of Joe Biden\u2019s win in the 2020 presidential election were \u201cprotecting democracy,\u201d according to a Quinnipiac poll taken AFTER the assault on the Capitol Trump incited. Seventy-three percent told pollsters they thought Trump, too, was \u201cprotecting\u201d democracy. Perhaps the most ominous number is the 24% of Republican voters who don\u2019t accept the results of the election, according to an NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist survey last month, leaving the question of whether they will accept the results of any election ever again. Coups aside, this was always the greatest threat of Trump\u2019s rhetoric, and a result that will delight dictators like Putin, who are always eager to denigrate democracy and its champions. At its core, democracy is an act of faith, a shared belief that the people can fairly act in the common good by choosing their leaders. Destroying the faith in the system will destroy the American experiment.  This is precisely what we are trying to counter at the Renew Democracy Initiative. We are launching a campaign dedicated to the simple phrase, \u201cwhat democracy means to me,\u201d in the hopes of reminding everyone what a luxury it is for every citizen to have a say in the course of their lives and of their nation. Democracy isn\u2019t liberal or conservative, not left or right \u2013 at least it isn\u2019t supposed to be. Millions of Americans currently believe that democracy isn\u2019t working, or even that it isn\u2019t worth saving. The battle to prove them wrong isn\u2019t over, it\u2019s just begun.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Sign up to get our new weekly column as a newsletter. We\u2019re looking back at the strongest, smartest opinion takes of the week from CNN and other outlets. In his 2004 novel \u201cThe Plot Against America,\u201d Philip Roth imagined an American president who coddled dictators abroad and condoned mobs at home. Would such an episode end democracy in the US? Or would it, by showing the consequences of an authoritarian leader, act as a kind of vaccine, prompting the nation\u2019s immune system to turn authoritarianism back for good? (The book became a series last year on HBO, which is owned by CNN\u2019s corporate parent WarnerMedia.) \u201cThe Plot Against America\u201d was fiction. But there were echoes of it in the question facing the US after the spectacle this week of an American president whipping up a crowd of supporters and urging them to head to the Capitol to block the final certification of the incoming president\u2019s victory in a free and fair election. Rioters invaded the building. Five people, including a police officer, died. Members of Congress scrambled for cover. Among those rushed away by Capitol Police was Rep. Seth Moulton, a US Marine veteran from Massachusetts. \u201cViolent assault on democracy\u201d was something he expected while serving in Iraq, he wrote. \u201cI never imagined it as a United States congressman in America.\u201d As police attempted to retake the building, Moulton lamented that, \u201cWe\u2019re sheltering together not because of a foreign terrorist attack, but because of a domestic coup attempt spurred on by rhetoric like that from the President and his supporters...Make no mistake: They are enemies of America. This is no protest. This is anarchy. It\u2019s domestic terrorism. The people who are in the building right now are traitors to our nation.\u201d As the attack unfolded, SE Cupp wrote, \u201cI will never forget this: Americans storming the United States Capitol in what can only be described as a coup attempt, a Trump supporter pictured standing at the Senate dais, and one jaw-dropping image of police pointing guns at the House front door from inside as a demonstrator appeared to be trying to breach the chamber.\u201d Cupp added: \u201cI will never forget the utter sadness over our divided, fragile democracy that one man has tried so desperately to cleave in half for his own corrupt, narcissistic and craven self-interest.\u201d Finally, the Capitol was cleared, and at 3:41 am Thursday, the electoral vote counting was completed. Joe Biden is due to take the oath of office as the 46th President on January 20. So far, a majority in the country appears to be decisively rejecting what President Donald Trump did and calling out his enablers, many of whom started jumping off his sinking ship. Democrats are moving to impeach Trump for a second time, with the possibility of some Republican support. Even though Trump has only 10 days left in office, wrote Julian Zelizer, it makes sense for Congress to \u201cgo on record stating that any president who incites an attack on another branch of government should no longer have the privilege of holding office.\u201d The Senate could not only convict Trump but also disqualify him from holding office in the future. The president whose inaugural speech talked of \u201cAmerican carnage\u201d turned out to be the one who produced it over his big lie \u2013 that he was cheated out of a re-election victory, John Avlon noted. \u201cOur country is far more divided and violent and deluded than before he entered office. His misrule has led to this moment, but it is not his responsibility alone. Trump\u2019s fear-fueled lies and extremism and conspiracy theories have been indulged for too long by partisans. His rhetoric has directly led to death threats against election officials who have done their job honestly and independently.\u201d The rioters are not patriots, not Republicans and not conservatives, but are domestic terrorists, wrote GOP commentator Scott Jennings. Trump\u2019s \u201clies and conspiracy theories\u201d about the election caused the insurrection. \u201cAll Republicans have a duty to support the republic and the Constitution by condemning this terrorism, rallying around the peaceful transfer of power and our constitutional institutions, and demanding all of the actions within the power of the President of the United States to restore order to our Capitol.\u201d When Paul Begala worked in the Capitol, his office window looked out to the National Mall. \u201cEvery night as the sun went down,\u201d Begala recalled, \u201cthe glow would illuminate my workplace, and I would ponder the miracle that a guy from Missouri City, Texas, could work in the same building where Lincoln served, walk the halls once strode by a confident young war hero named Jack Kennedy, go to meetings in the room where Harry Truman learned that FDR had died and that he now bore the awful burden of presidency.  \u201cNone of that history stopped these thugs. None of the majesty mattered to this mob. They cared not a whit about Lincoln or Kennedy, nor about the Constitution or the country. Their flag was not the Stars and Stripes that have draped the caskets of so many actual American patriots. Rather, it was the banner of a cult of personality, the name that had been emblazoned on a fraudulent \u2018university\u2019 and failed casinos.\u201d Last week ripped the final shreds off the mask of Trump, exposing him as a classic authoritarian leader, wrote Ruth Ben-Ghiat. \u201cAlthough Trump lost the election two months ago, for his followers, he was the winner who had unjustly been deprived of what was rightfully his. Add in the culture of armed insurgency and the anti-democratic, extremist beliefs many of these groups espouse, and the solution of \u2018direct action\u2019 \u2013 namely, an armed takeover of the halls of power to save the leader \u2013 becomes compelling\u2026 Trump, of course, was not in the building. He set the fire, but was careful not to be in a position to get burned by it or control it.\u201d Incoming President Joe Biden condemned the attack on the Capitol, offered reasssuring words to the nation, and continued filling out his Cabinet, but he won\u2019t become President for more than a week. In the meantime, Democrats in Congress are urging Vice President Mike Pence to remove Trump under the provisions of the 25th Amendment. \u201cEvery day he is in office there is a very real possibility that he will unleash his backers in new and harmful ways,\u201d wrote Frida Ghitis. \u201cAt this moment when everything is at stake, Pence can not only save the country, but he can also start the process of repairing America\u2019s battered reputation.\u201d Law enforcement officials promised to take action against the rioters. Americans \u201cdeserve to know that everyone who participated in this act of seditious terror will be investigated and prosecuted under the law,\u201d wrote Joe Lockhart. \u201cRepublican leaders also need to take responsibility and look within their own party to confront those who helped encourage this insurrection.\u201d \u201cThe FBI says it \u2018is seeking to identify individuals instigating violence in Washington, D.C.,\u2019\u201d noted Jill Filipovic. \u201cIf they\u2019re looking for the chief instigator, they should walk over to 1600 Pennsylvania Avenue. If they\u2019re looking for the many who carried out the violence, looting, and ransacking, many of their faces are easily visible in photos and videos, and many are bragging about their acts on social media.\u201d One key question will be whether Trump could be held legally responsible for the riot. \u201cThese domestic terrorists attacked the great symbol of American democracy,\u201d wrote Peter Bergen, \u201cand they should be held accountable \u2013 and so should their Inciter-in-Chief, President Donald J. Trump.\u201d \u201cThere are limits to the First Amendment. It is a crime to incite or solicit others to commit crimes if you have reason to believe they may actually carry out those crimes,\u201d wrote Bergen. A former prosecutor, CNN legal analyst Elie Honig, wrote that \u201cthere is a criminal case to be made against President Donald Trump for his role in the assault on the Capitol. It\u2019s not an easy case or an automatic win for prosecutors. But there is a legitimate case there for any prosecutor with the fortitude to bring it \u2014 and the ability to counter the defenses Trump\u2019s legal team may use to fight back.\u201d It was impossible to miss the racial implications of the attack by the overwhelmingly White crowd and the sharp contrast to the way law enforcement reacted to Black Lives Matter protests last year. \u201cAs I watched the siege of the Capitol building,\u201d wrote Roxanne Jones, \u201cI recalled the George Floyd protests in Lafayette Park near the White House in June, where heavily armed law enforcement set off explosives and fired gas on peacefully gathered citizens of all races \u2013 some of them even on their knees with their hands up or lying flat on the ground. Photo after photo of that day shows protesters being beaten, arrested and dispersed by police.\u201d By contrast, it was all too easy for the rioters to invade the Capitol this week. Historians Rhae Lynn Barnes and Keri Leigh Merritt pointed out that \u201cas rioters, incited by the President and with some carrying White supremacist imagery descended upon the Capitol, scaled its walls, planted pipe bombs, and dangled from its railings, the pictures and videos were simultaneously stunning and revolting: The bright reds of the Confederate and Nazi flags and matching MAGA hats simmered against a sea of Trump flags now sold on street corner popup shops that outnumbered American flags, a noose, a raised wooden cross reminiscent of Klan lynchings, and a sweater reading \u2018Camp Auschwitz.\u2019 The lineage between the slaveholding secessionists and the modern insurrectionists could not have been more clear: Both groups were willing to destroy the union and both used violence to deflect their own racial fantasies of power and privilege slipping away.\u201d To Nicole Hemmer, the riot evoked memories of the August, 2017 Charlottesville \u201cUnite the Right\u201d rally, in which far-right extremists, including neo-Nazis confronted counter-protesters. The parallels: \u201cthe hesitance of law enforcement to engage White, right-wing protesters (and their delay in doing so), the turn in right-wing media to the bogeyman of antifa as the source of disorder, the President\u2019s efforts to excuse or embrace the violence of his supporters.\u201d After the Capitol was secured, a few Black custodians were seen in a video widely viewed on social media sweeping up the damage from the riot, noted Issac Bailey. It revealed, he wrote, \u201cAn abiding dignity in the work the men are doing. An illustration of their importance to the health of this country, just the latest example of how Black Americans remained steadfast throughout our history come what may. \u201cIt feels wrong that they had to pick up the pieces from a failed insurrection attempt that, had it been successful, would have disenfranchised millions of voters, particularly those in areas with heavy Black populations.\u201d Through the eyes of a longtime law enforcement official, Cedric L. Alexander, the preparations for defending the Capitol seemed deeply flawed. \u201cThe Capitol appeared to be weakly \u2018guarded\u2019 by Capitol Police, a force massively outnumbered by the gathering insurrectionist mob,\u201d Alexander noted. \u201cGuarding an important site requires defense in depth. At the Capitol, not even a thinly fortified perimeter had been established.\u201d Was it \u201cincompetence, gross negligence or both?,\u201d Alexander asked. \u201cThe only real mystery here \u2013 and it is a mystery with the most profound implications \u2013 is why law enforcement left itself so unprepared for a dangerous event many people, up to and including the President of the United States, had not merely anticipated but had actually announced days and days in advance.\u201d Paul Callan observed, \u201cThe inability of police forces of the most powerful nation in human history to adequately protect the Capitol building from an angry mob seems inconceivable. Where were the Secret Service, the FBI, the National Guard, not to mention the nation\u2019s powerful armed forces?\u201d Former White House chief of staff and Northern Ireland special envoy Mick Mulvaney was among the first of the Trump officials to resign over the President\u2019s actions. \u201cWhat took so long, when all of this was so predictable,\u201d asked Doug Heye, a former senior GOP official who repudiated Trump early in 2016. \u201cTrump has incited violence and sown division since he declared his candidacy in 2015. In the end, this is exactly what Mulvaney signed up for, whether he cares to admit it or not.\u201d This week\u2019s events demonstrated even to longtime loyalists Mike Pence and Mitch McConnell how wrong they were to back Trump, wrote Michael D\u2019Antonio. \u201cAs the mob careens around the Capitol and lawmakers huddle together in a secret and secure facility, it\u2019s obvious that the likes of McConnell and Pence are far too late with the little display of opposition they mustered on the darkest day that hallowed building has ever seen.\u201d After four years of enabling Trump\u2019s extremism on their platforms, Facebook, Twitter and others suspended his accounts, and then Twitter banned Trump permanently. They were also too late, wrote Kara Alaimo. \u201cOne reason that things got so out of hand in the first place is because Twitter didn\u2019t shut Trump\u2019s account down sooner,\u201d she noted. \u201cThe platform, of course, allowed Trump to bypass the traditional media, which would have fact checked him, and make claims that were patently false\u2026 And because no one was willing to shut him down (@jack, I\u2019m looking at you), he only became more emboldened. Social networks should have held Trump to the same standards as other users from the start.\u201d Don\u2019t forget Trump\u2019s enablers in Congress, including Sens. Josh Hawley and Ted Cruz, who led the baseless challenge to the counting of electoral votes Wednesday. \u201cThe three repulsive architects of Wednesday\u2019s heartbreaking spectacle \u2014 mobs desecrating the Republic\u2019s noblest building and preventing the completion of a constitutional process \u2014 must be named and forevermore shunned,\u201d wrote George Will, in the Washington Post. \u201cThey are Donald Trump, and Sens. Josh Hawley and Ted Cruz.\u201d A day before the Capitol insurrection, Democrats won stunning victories in the Georgia runoff elections, giving them control of the US Senate to go along with their hold on the House and the next presidency. The winning campaigns of Jon Ossoff and the Rev.

It is also that progressive grassroots leaders (led overwhelmingly by Black women) have reimagined, recreated and rebuilt the state\u2019s Democratic Party coalition.\u201d For more on Georgia: Peniel Joseph: What the Warnock-Ossoff win tells us about a transforming South David Axelrod: The courage of Brad Raffensperger Lanhee Chen: Georgia runoffs crown new power brokers in Washington The Capitol riot and Georgia runoffs overshadowed a horrific week of death and disease from the Covid-19 pandemic. On Thursday alone, more than 4,000 Americans died. In California\u2019s hospitals, the scenes were especially dire. \u201cThanksgiving, Christmas and now New Year\u2019s celebrations that shouldn\u2019t have happened have now led to countless Covid infections that are claiming their victims and testing our endurance,\u201d wrote ER doctor Haig Aintablian. \u201cNo doctor I know has ever seen a situation like this outside of a natural disaster, terrorist attack or war. Our hospitals have so many Covid patients fighting to survive that they have overwhelmed our ICUs and led to overflow units that were never designed for such patients.\u201d Infectious disease expert Dr. Kent Sepkowitz noted that, \u201ceven the brutal fact that it has killed more than 1.8 million people globally, including 350,000 in the US, has failed to sway some. We continue to have inconsistent acceptance of basic public health measures, as if the recommendations were an assault on free choice, a capitulation to a bunch of whimpering scientists with their fake news graphs and charts.\u201d Vaccines are our best hope, he wrote. If more than half of the people are vaccinated, Sepkowitz observed, \u201crather than a runaway pandemic, we would see occasional small and moderate-sized outbreaks here and there, similar to what we see with measles, whooping cough and other vaccine-preventable infections almost every year. It\u2019s terrible and tragic and unnecessary \u2013 but it\u2019s not on the same scale as the current historic pandemic.\u201d Ariel Dorfman: What Trump has made blindingly clear to America Julian Zelizer: What we forget about Jimmy Carter\u2019s legacy Swanee Hunt: Republican women in the House could change everything AND\u2026 Albert Thakur grew up as an immigrant from India on New York\u2019s Long Island.

He\u2019s the author of \u201cMy Brother Moochie: Regaining Dignity in the Face of Crime, Poverty and Racism in the American South.\u201d His latest book is \u201cWhy Didn\u2019t We Riot? A Black Man in Trumpland.\u201d The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion on CNN. The image is jarring because it\u2019s a scene so commonplace, so normal. A few Black men are seen in a video sweeping and vacuuming in the Capitol building to undo some of the damage caused by a mostly White mob trying to overturn an election because their preferred candidate lost. Given this country\u2019s racial history, it\u2019s difficult or darn near impossible not to see those decades-deep racial connections. There\u2019s something else, too, though. An abiding dignity in the work the men are doing. An illustration of their importance to the health of this country, just the latest example of how Black Americans remained steadfast throughout our history come what may. It feels wrong that they had to pick up the pieces from a failed insurrection attempt that, had it been successful, would have disenfranchised millions of voters, particularly those in areas with heavy Black populations. It not only feels wrong but is wrong. It shouldn\u2019t be this way. In the democracy we all supposedly love and cherish, the racial and income and power inequalities evident in that video shouldn\u2019t exist. But they do and always have. Black people have always been forced into a kind of Sophie\u2019s choice, to love a place that has for too long hated us while knowing that\u2019s what\u2019s best for us all, nevertheless. I don\u2019t want to read too much into the motivations of those men. Maybe they simply felt they had to do their jobs. Still, their presence in that place at that moment signified something deeper than just work duty. Whatever the reason they were there, Black people cleaning up after a White mob trying to undermine democracy is a powerful image, especially considering that nooses were among the things the rioters were carrying and the Confederate flag paraded through the chamber. This is what it looks like when toxic White privilege is left unchecked Despite the chaos, the Black men seen cleaning up remained focused on what they could change, what they could improve. They didn\u2019t get caught up in returning hatred with hatred, anger with bitterness, confrontation with balled fists. That\u2019s very much in line with how Black people survived horrific race-based chattel slavery to get a taste of freedom and how they only wanted equality, not revenge. It is how they endured a century of lynchings and Jim Crow and opposed it with a world-changing, non-violent movement. Even now, even in the face of a President who appeals to racist bigots and incited a riot in the nation\u2019s capital, a man who spent five years before he was elected smearing the country\u2019s first Black president with a bigoted conspiracy theory, that hasn\u2019t changed. Black people aren\u2019t asking for special treatment or to be given all the power. They are asking not to be unnecessarily killed by armed-agents of the state, better schools for their children, a just justice system and a fairer shot at competing for jobs and careers. Whether unprepared or unwilling, police failed at the US Capitol In the wake of Trump\u2019s victory in 2016, they did not try to overthrow the government because they didn\u2019t get what they wanted. They organized to better utilize their political power. And without Black voters, President-elect Joe Biden would never have been able to put an end to the nightmare of Trump. Those men in that video were not only cleaning up after the actions of pro-Trump supporters eager to disenfranchise people who look like them. They were readying the place for leaders who had to flee but needed to return to complete their tasks. They were sweeping up the broken glass inside while the mob was outside praising itself for undermining our democracy \u2013 making the US a laughingstock around the globe \u2013 and confronting law enforcement officials who had finally begun taking charge.  With each stroke of the broom, they were slowly helping to piece this democracy back together. It\u2019s what Black people have always done, no matter the circumstances, not matter the burden placed upon their backs. I\u2019m just wondering how much more \u2013 and how much longer \u2013 we have to endure to perfect this democracy.",

The opinions expressed in this commentary are the writer\u2019s own. Read more opinion at CNN. The sacking of the US Capitol by right-wing goons marks a turning point in American democracy. This country has a long and hallowed tradition of peaceful protest and civil disobedience, which has played a central role in many of America\u2019s important struggles for social and economic change, including the civil rights movement, the fight for women\u2019s suffrage, the labor movement and many others. But make no mistake \u2013 what took place at the US Capitol Wednesday is not a part of that tradition. If a group of Trump supporters entered the Capitol and held a sit-in in the rotunda, they might be able to make the claim that they were engaging in the type of peaceful protest that is key to American democracy. That is not what happened. The invasion of the Capitol has been called an insurrection. Others have called it an attempted coup. These characterizations get at the truth. But regardless of what one calls it, it was an overt attempt to stop our constitutionally mandated process of peacefully transferring power from one administration to the next. Violent, far-right rioters \u2013 egged on by the President himself \u2013 tried to thwart the very operation of our democracy by force. These thugs, to put it bluntly, acted as enemies of our republic \u2013 the very domestic enemies lawmakers are sworn to oppose when they take their oath of office. Some will say that January 6 will turn Americans away from Trumpism and potentially spark a more civil discourse in politics. We can all pray they are right. But this naive view ignores the deep social and economic ills that drove tens of millions of hard-working Americans into Trump\u2019s arms throughout the last four years, including a growing percentage of minority voters. Those preconditions still exist, ready to be exploited by Trump and those who seek to emulate him. Hold Trump accountable for incitement The darker and more likely truth is that American democracy is in grave danger despite Trump\u2019s election defeat in November. In 1923, a fringe, right-wing party in the democratic German Weimar Republic attempted a coup that history remembers as the Beer Hall Putsch. It was amateurish in its execution and quickly crushed by authorities. Democracy was saved\u2026or so it seemed at the time. The Weimar government\u2019s response toward the perpetrators of the coup, however, was timid to say the least. Adolf Hitler, the Nazi Party leader who plotted the putsch, was convicted of treason and served less than a year of his five-year sentence. With Germany reeling from hyperinflation and a shattered economy, Hitler was on his way to becoming the dictator of Germany, the initiator of World War II and the mass murderer of six million Jews in the Holocaust. Our republic cannot afford to ignore the possibility that January 6 represents the same warning sign of creeping right-wing authoritarianism in our own democracy. Our government must act swiftly by seeking the maximum punishment under the law for all those who smashed their way into the Capitol. This is the moment for resolve, not handwringing. The republic must make clear that it will defend itself from this existential threat. The response must also hold law enforcement leaders accountable for failing to protect the halls of Congress from invasion. It is inexcusable that the mostly White Trump supporters were allowed to desecrate one of America\u2019s most important monuments to democracy. This failure is even more offensive when taking into account the aggressive police response to the Black Lives Matter protests this summer. Senate Sergeant-at-Arms Michael Stenger has already resigned, while Capitol Police Chief Steven Sund and House Sergeant-at-Arms Paul Irving will be stepping down from their posts. Congressional leaders were right to demand their resignations, but we still need a full accounting. A Confederate flag at the Capitol summons America's demons Vice President Mike Pence and the cabinet secretaries need to immediately invoke the 25th Amendment and remove President Donald Trump from office. Trump may not have directly ordered the assault on the Capitol, but he certainly stoked lies about election fraud, instructed his followers to head to the Capitol on Wednesday and initially resisted calling the National Guard once his supporters breached the building. While Trump finally acknowledged on Thursday a new administration would enter the White House on January 20, his concession comes after baselessly denigrating America\u2019s democratic processes, encouraging violence and threatening to remain in office even in the face of electoral defeat. If Pence is unwilling to take action, Congress must rally immediately to defend our republic. The House should vote to impeach Trump and the Senate should return to Washington to hold a trial. Even if Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnel refuses to act before inauguration, the world will take note and history will distinguish between the patriots prepared to defend our American democracy and the cowards willing to give the President a pass. But even if Trump is removed from office, the work to rebuild the fabric of our democracy would not be finished. Every lawmaker must be intentional about restoring the people\u2019s faith in our government. Too many people who have been left behind feel unrepresented in our political process and believe with increasing justification that no matter how hard they work, no matter how closely they follow the rules, the doorway to economic prosperity and social dignity is closed to them. That environment creates fertile ground for authoritarians like Trump to sow misinformation, undermine our democracy and foment racial and social division. That has to change if the republic is to survive.  The overarching focus of the Biden administration and the 117th Congress must be to address the very real inequities in this society in a bold and unwavering way. Those committed to our constitutional system of government \u2013 as President-elect Joe Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris are \u2013 must demonstrate they are equally and authentically committed to the well-being of working Americans of all races. At the end of the day, that is the only cure for the cancer of right-wing authoritarianism that is metastasizing in the nation\u2019s body politic. Without that cure, the attack on the US Capitol on January 6, 2021, may well turn out to be America\u2019s Beer Hall Putsch.",

View more opinion articles on CNN. The victories of the Rev. Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff in Georgia put the United States in the midst of truly transformative times. America\u2019s ongoing Third Reconstruction \u2013 a searing effort to literally and figuratively reimagine American democracy as multiracial, antiracist and dedicated to intersectional social justice \u2013 continued Tuesday in the Peach State as the Democratic Senate candidates Warnock and Ossoff defeated Republican incumbents Kelly Loeffler and David Perdue in a runoff election. Warnock will become the first Black senator to represent Georgia, the home state of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr., whose church Warnock presides over and whom the candidate invoked often during his campaign and in his victory speech. It\u2019s also a state whose Stone Mountain serves as a violently nostalgic homage to the renewed Ku Klux Klan of the early 20th century. Warnock is, after South Carolina Republican Tim Scott, just the second African American elected to the US Senate from a Southern state. During Reconstruction, Hiram Revels and Blanche Bruce served brief Senate terms (before senators were elected by popular vote). Crucially, Warnock\u2019s victory benefited from the reverse migration of African Americans back South that has followed the Great Migrations of the first half of the 20th century to Northern cities. The region is being transformed, political, culturally and economically, by an infusion of residents unbowed by the South\u2019s racial past. This wave of change is imbuing the nation with a new self-awareness of its traumatic political past and the opportunities to achieve a different vision of American democracy and society. Even as Americans struggle to process the horrifying images coming from Washington, DC, of violence at the Capitol, they are also hearing the message of what\u2019s happened in Georgia. These victories cannot be muted by riots. They speak loud and clear: America has arrived at a hinge point in our long racial history, an inflection point where history collides with contemporary culture to innovate bold new political directions. The biggest loser in the Georgia runoffs Warnock represents the fusion of old and new forms of Southern politics. Atlanta, which once dubbed itself \u201cThe City Too Busy to Hate,\u201d has proven the seeding ground for the kind of political and cultural transformation dreamed of by King but made more readily available in our own time by the combination of demographic changes, grassroots political organizing and social movements. Rev. Warnock\u2019s victory is remarkable in the fact that he consciously ran a campaign rooted in aspects of Martin Luther King\u2019s vision of creating a \u201cBeloved Community\u201d free of racism, economic injustice and poverty. King\u2019s \u201cI Have a Dream\u201d speech referenced Stone Mountain, a living monument to the tattered dreams of White supremacy, as a place where freedom did not yet ring but one day would. This moment has been a long time coming, one orchestrated in part through the tireless voting rights advocacy of Black women activists led by Stacey Abrams, the onetime gubernatorial candidate who turned a close loss to Brian Kemp in 2018 into a comeback for the ages. Abrams\u2019 political advocacy transcended personal and partisan interests. She proved herself determined to be a service-oriented political and policy leader devoted to a project larger than her individual ambitions \u2013 preserving, protecting and expanding voting rights for Black Americans. The triumph of Stacey Abrams over Donald Trump She received plenty of help. 2020\u2019s year of racial and political reckoning, amid a health pandemic that triggered economic devastation and a President and Republican Party openly hostile to honoring election results, helped to galvanize millions of Americans for the first time. The cultural power of a national Black Lives Matter movement inspired people from celebrities to sports figures to become politically engaged. WNBA players openly endorsed Rev. Warnock, a sign that this New Year is a time for choosing moral sides rather than embracing the kind of neutrality that allows political oppression to grow and expand. Sen. Kelly Loeffler\u2019s pointed rejection of the WNBA\u2019s racial justice message set stark lines between the two candidates and reflected the cultural divide within the nation. Rev. Warnock was far behind Loeffler when the WNBA\u2019s Atlanta Dream started to wear \u201cVote Warnock\u201d T-shirts that helped to propel him to the US Senate. The increasing political consciousness of WNBA players was further enhanced by Abrams\u2019 position on the board of advocates of the Women\u2019s National Basketball Players Association. The players, predominantly Black women, used their athletic platform to spur social change, a move further amplified in the aftermath of George Floyd\u2019s killing. The WNBA has come too far to be silenced by Kelly Loeffler Atlanta\u2019s hip-hop artists also played a decisive role in voter turnout, organizing rallies and fundraising in support of Biden and Harris this past November, and then Warnock and Ossoff. Speaking to Rolling Stone, Rapper Young Jeezy explained, \u201cIf the right people are not in the Senate, it\u2019s gonna make it hard for the Biden-Harris administration to do anything they need to do and that they promised to us.\u201d In truly extraordinary ways, politics and culture have been realigned in service of an expansively inclusive vision of American democracy, one wherein Black athletes, musicians and artists are utilizing their platforms to promote social justice on an unprecedented scale. That Georgia, in one fell swoop, could elect two senators, one Black and one Jewish, who will give the Democratic Party control of Congress is not only remarkable, but it echoes the close relationship between these two communities that peaked during the civil rights movement\u2019s heroic period. Warnock characterized Ossoff as \u201chis brother from another mother\u201d and the newly elected Black senator\u2019s progressive rhetoric seemed to rub off on Ossoff as Election Day neared. Ossoff wins the Georgia runoff against Perdue, CNN projects From Dr. King\u2019s relationship with the towering Jewish Rabbi Abraham Joshua Heschel to the extraordinary numbers of Jewish students who volunteered for 1964\u2019s Freedom Summer and locked arms with Black citizens in Selma, Black-Jewish alliances during the civil rights era proved indispensable to achieving the movement\u2019s larger goals. In the age of Black Lives Matter, especially since George Floyd\u2019s murder, we have witnessed a resurgence of this coalition that is perhaps best symbolized by the dual victories of Warnock and Ossoff. In so doing, this special election illustrated the possible rise of a religious left of Christian and Jewish voters in support of progressive politics in a part of the country long thought to be hopelessly conservative. Black voters deserve a special shout-out. Rebuked and scorned historically, abused and traumatized in the present, but in possession of a defiant, faith-fueled dignity, Black folk organized in the face of threats, harassment and potential violence to exercise democratic rights that parts of the nation remain intent on stripping away. And this is not the first time they have displayed such loyalty and love to a country that stubbornly refuses to return these feelings. During America\u2019s First Reconstruction after the Civil War, Black men achieved voting rights after 1870 and formed powerful interracial coalitions that led to public schools, better local and national infrastructure, and promised to transform democracy before being repelled through both physical violence and baseless allegations of election fraud of the kind that Trump and Republicans have resurrected today.  We can see the aftermath of this moment in history still unfolding in the race baiting, unfounded allegations of election fraud and conspiracy theories that have become the hallmark of the modern-day GOP. Georgia reminds us that history is not destiny. America always has a choice, an opportunity, a calling to right wrongs, spread justice, do good. 2020\u2019s whiplash-inducing days of hope shadowed by racial violence, a global health pandemic and economic inequality might prove to be the growing pains required to become a mature democracy. Tuesday\u2019s election outcome illustrates how the national power and resonance of the Black struggle for citizenship and dignity \u2013 in all aspects of society \u2013 holds the key to not just understanding America\u2019s past but embracing a more liberated and just future.",

Read more opinion on CNN. What happens to a nation incapable of healing itself? I ask as an American citizen concerned about our damaged democracy but also as someone with roots in Chile, which after many years of dictatorship suffered the harmful consequences of failing to fully complete its democratic transition. It is just such a major transition that the United States needs today. Most of my fellow Americans may find this idea puzzling, even insulting. Our country has no restrictions of freedom of speech or assembly. It just carried out an election that the sitting President lost decisively, despite his and his supporters\u2019 many desperate efforts to overturn the result. It seems clear that by Wednesday, when Congress meets to officially acknowledge Donald Trump\u2019s defeat, we should no longer be worried about the transfer of power, the successful transition, in effect, between administrations. Federal judge throws out Gohmert lawsuit asking Pence to interfere in Electoral College count It is true that Trump continues to deny his loss and to recklessly try to undermine his successor, President-elect Joe Biden. He may yet inflict more havoc and pain on our country and the world before he is gone, but at least this specific nightmare will end on January 20, when Biden is sworn in as the 46th President. Congratulating ourselves on the stability of our democratic foundations should not blind us to the fact that Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris are inheriting a grievously wounded democracy. It is not just that our laws and norms failed to prevent a raging demagogue from winning the presidency, enriching himself and his family, pardoning convicted murderers and perjuring sycophants, and trampling on the Constitution with quasi-dictatorial behavior. The inability of our nation\u2019s institutions to have blocked, let alone prosecuted in the courts, such malfeasance and venality is a symptom of deeper problems that a changing of the guard, however encouraging, cannot ultimately resolve. America's Covid vaccine campaign is not a disaster After all, if slightly more than 40,000 voters in three states had changed their minds \u2014 or had their ballots suppressed or thrown out \u2014 the result would have been different, creating a tie in the Electoral College that would have thrown the question of who should be President into the House of Representatives. In that scenario, each state would only have a single vote in the House of Representatives, and it is possible and indeed probable that Trump would have been elected, thwarting the will of the majority \u2014 more than 81 million people. It is the sort of trouble we do not need \u2014 and it stems from the absurd Electoral College, devised in the 18th century to appease slave states desperate to keep their human chattel. This is an America where, as we have seen demonstrated in only the past few years, just a handful of Supreme Court justices, anointed by a flagrantly unrepresentative Senate, can undo the rights obtained through decades of struggle by women, patients, workers, minorities and unions \u2014 and too often contravene the rights recognized and protected by their wiser colleagues and predecessors on the high court. We have seen how justices can allow the earth to be ravaged for profit and open the door to corporations to influence elections and legislation with enormous infusions of money. It is an America where an indecent accumulation of wealth at the top leads to breathtaking inequality and despair in vast sectors of the population, with millions of disaffected men and women looking to some faux populist savior to rescue them. This is an America that gerrymanders districts, disenfranchises minorities and tolerates racial hatred and anti-immigrant sentiment. An America that, unwilling to rein in police brutality and gun violence at home, has supported dictators and autocrats abroad as part of a foreign policy that was the de facto consensus for most of our history, no matter which party was in power. What Trump never said An America where a startling number of ordinary men and women, in thrall to serial mendacity, mistrust the electoral process when their candidate loses. It would be all too easy to postpone confronting the structural causes behind this state of affairs, given that the nation \u2014 including its lawmakers and the incoming Biden-Harris administration \u2014 must cope with an unrelenting economic recession, volatile international relations, ecological catastrophes, a polarized public and, above all, a criminally mismanaged pandemic. But Americans, awakened by the traumatic Trump experience to the more permanent frailties and limitations of their governing system, should not waste this unique opportunity to simultaneously tackle a festering crisis of democracy itself, which, if left unaddressed, will continue to endanger the republic. If we think of Trump\u2019s reign not as an outlier but the extreme expression of a morbidity that has been accumulating since the birth of the country, rooted in the tangles of our collective history and DNA, then true healing can only begin if we the people decide to make an open-ended transition to an all-inclusive, all-embracing democracy, one that dares to reimagine the nation\u2019s broken identity. A new Constitution would be ideal, but if that is unfeasible, let us at least start a wide-ranging conversation about how to face this crisis with our eyes, hearts and intellects open. Mike Pence is in a weird spot Perhaps due to my Chilean origins, I am convinced that we urgently need drastic solutions and radical reforms, not piecemeal and partial ones. Americans should heed the cautionary tale that Chile sends us. In 1990, after 17 years of dictatorship, Chileans regained the right to determine their own destiny, but they were unable to take the crucial next step of pressuring their leaders to right the wrongs of the past and move forward to a full democracy. Remnants of the old regime survived, and strangled attempts at indispensable economic, political and social reforms. Without those reforms, a majority of the people felt left out of the mainstream of public life, discourse and consensus, and became more cynical about democracy itself. They got ever angrier as they watched their land riven by economic disparity, with one system for the privileged and another for those without the means or power to be really heard.  Only now, 30 years later, fueled by last year\u2019s popular uprising that almost toppled the government, has Chile started on the road to a constitutional convention where the people will determine how they wish to be governed and, just as crucially, how the justice and equality they crave can become a reality. Let us hope it does not take 30 years, and immense additional suffering, for the sovereign American people to recognize that it is time to achieve a higher form of democracy that will finally fulfill the promise of a more perfect union.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Julian Zelizer, a CNN political analyst, is a professor of history and public affairs at Princeton University and author of the book, \u201cBurning Down the House: Newt Gingrich, the Fall of a Speaker, and the Rise of the New Republican Party.\u201d Follow him on Twitter @julianzelizer. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. Watch CNN Films\u2019 \u201cJimmy Carter: Rock & Roll President\u201d Sunday, January 3 at 9 p.m. ET. View more opinion at CNN. While former President Jimmy Carter is often remembered as a strait-laced figure, he embodied countercultural cool in 1976, when he was the Democratic presidential nominee. \u201cJimmy Carter: Rock and Roll President,\u201d an engaging documentary that airs on CNN on January 3, takes us back to when this largely unknown governor from Georgia \u2013 mocked as \u201cJimmy Who?\u201d \u2013 ran for the highest office in the land and defeated incumbent Gerald Ford. Throughout his political journey, some of the hippest musicians of the time kept flocking to support him. Rockers and edgy country singer-songwriters like Bob Dylan and Willie Nelson have always been among some of his biggest fans. From the moment that Carter announced his presidential run, the Allman Brothers, among the most legendary bands from the era, played benefit concerts to raise money for his campaign. As U2\u2019s Bono reminisced during a speech featured in the documentary, \u201cHe campaigned with the Allman Brothers. You got the feeling that if his hair was a little longer, he\u2019d be in the Allman Brothers.\u201d When Carter first met Dylan, the meeting made the music icon feel uneasy, since he was as anti-establishment as they came, but Carter put \u201cmy mind at ease by not talking down to me and showing me that he had sincere appreciation for the songs that I had written.\u201d Most important, Dylan realized then that Carter was a different kind of politician than most. Why would the rock-and-roll set flock to a man who, as president, is remembered today as being a micro-managing, straight-arrow engineer who failed to inspire or understand leadership? The reason is that in his prime, Jimmy Carter was cool. He championed a kind of political populism that was extremely attractive to Americans disillusioned with Washington in the wake of Vietnam and Watergate. Sick and tired of elected officials who betrayed them, they found a refreshing change in Carter, a former peanut farmer who was seen as an anti-establishment outsider. As Bishop Michael Curry recalls in the documentary, \u201cWe were coming out of the Watergate era and looking \u2026to be a country of integrity again.\u201d The Imperial Presidency, as the historian Arthur Schlesinger Jr. famously described in his 1973 book of the same name, applied to those modern presidents who had expanded their executive powers beyond what was outlined in the Constitution. As a result, these presidents \u2013 many of whom showed a willingness to move the nation in dangerous directions \u2013 had become disconnected from voters. Lyndon Johnson, younger Democrats complained, brought us deeper into the quagmire of Vietnam; Richard Nixon abused his power so that he could maintain it. The Allman Brothers\u2019 Chuck Leavell remembers thinking in the 1976 election, \u201cIsn\u2019t it time for someone with great integrity and dignity to take his office?\u201d In contrast to President Donald Trump\u2019s populism, which has revolved around racial resentment, Twitter tirades and rally rhetoric attacking people and institutions that didn\u2019t support him, Carter hoped to bring the nation a stripped-down presidency, defined less by pomp and circumstance and more by tackling the difficult problems facing the nation. When Paul Simon sang \u201cAmerican Tune\u201d at the inauguration in 1977, hitting the words, \u201cI\u2019m all right, I\u2019m just weary to my bones,\u201d he seemed to speak for many disaffected people who didn\u2019t believe that Carter could be anything better than Richard Nixon. When Aretha Franklin belted out \u201cGod Bless America\u201d she tapped into the hope, buried deep in many Americans at the time, that this country could still reach its promise. Carter understood all of that and was determined to give them hope again. The simple way Jimmy and Rosalynn Carter live their lives and values Though Carter\u2019s presidency has often been disparaged, he did deliver in many ways. As Jonathan Alter recounts in his new book, \u201cHis Very Best: Jimmy Carter, a Life,\u201d President Carter was notable in that he was willing to tackle difficult policy challenges, from the environment and energy to peace in the Middle East, even if they were not politically smart issues to take on. He constantly burned bridges with his own coalition to take on issues. His presidency was also filled with symbolic gestures meant to show that a president could be sensitive to the limits of his own power. During his inauguration, Carter, along with his wife and daughter, stepped out of the limo and walked the streets as an elated crowd looked on. He did away with the \u201cHail to the Chief\u201d anthem before public entrances and spoke on television wearing a cardigan sweater. From the start, he didn\u2019t seek to put himself on a pedestal above those he was meant to lead. And this meant something at the time. For a people desperate for a new direction, it offered hope that politics could be different. He made the presidency so engaging that even bands like Crosby, Stills and Nash would show up at the White House just to have a chance to meet him, as the film recounts. Of course, in the end the presidency didn\u2019t work out as well as he had hoped. Carter, who was overwhelmed by the Iran Hostage Crisis and a flagging economy, ended up losing reelection. He backtracked on some of his populism, such as rejecting bolder proposals to use public spending to stimulate the economy or backing away from national health insurance (which caused an immense rift with liberal stalwart Senator Ted Kennedy), and gradually came to be seen as more \u201cestablishment.\u201d But it\u2019s worth looking back on those original years \u2013 when rock and rollers, as well as country music mavericks \u2013 saw something fresh and inspiring in Carter\u2019s political populism. He was one of the rare leaders who tried to make himself a little less important to benefit the overall health of our democracy.  In recent years, the nation has been sold a brand of populism wielded by a deeply divisive president who abused his executive powers and did little to address the needs of average Americans.  After his presidency ended, Carter returned to the spirit that animated him in 1976. Rather than spending his time giving high-paid speeches or living in seclusion, Carter created the Carter Center, devoted to diplomatic initiatives, eradicating disease and promoting democracy. He has worked for Habitat for Humanity, building houses for those without economic means. \u201cThere has not been a president \u2026 who has done more since they left office \u2026 just the humanitarians that they have been to us as a nation and to the world,\u201d says country singer Trisha Yearwood, who along with her husband Garth Brooks has worked with the Carters on Habitat. In other words, Carter has used his position as a platform for promoting social justice, defining a post-presidency that has been radically different from that of those who came before him. Jimmy Carter showed us that populism isn\u2019t always a bad thing if it comes with integrity and a genuine concern for the nation\u2019s citizenry. We need that more than ever today after four years of chaos, instability and dysfunction",

            "article_content": " A year ago, rioters protesting the results of the 2020 election attacked the US Capitol building, infiltrating some of the most hallowed chambers of American democracy and setting off shockwaves of violence and division across the country. Much has happened since, but the consequences of that day continue to reverberate. Here\u2019s a look at the impact of this anniversary, plus everything else you need to Get Up to Speed and On with Your Day. (You can also get \u201c5 Things You Need to Know Today\u201d delivered to your inbox daily. Sign up here.) President Biden has refused to assert executive privilege over more documents that former President Trump wants to keep out of the hands of the committee investigating the January 6 Capitol riot. Trump has tried to keep the documents secret by claiming executive privilege, but since he is no longer president, legal experts agree Biden has final say on whether they\u2019re covered by such a measure. Biden previously refused to assert executive privilege over a similar batch of Trump-related documents, and the White House has said Biden wants the committee to have as much information as possible about January\u2019s attack. Meanwhile, the Biden administration is expected to name Kim Wyman, a Republican secretary of state who challenged Trump\u2019s false claims of election fraud, to a key election security role with the Department of Homeland Security. What\u2019s happening today: House Speaker Nancy Pelosi has announced several events at the Capitol that will commemorate today\u2019s anniversary, including a prayer, a moment of silence on the House floor and a conversation led by two historians aimed at preserving narratives of the attack. Lawmakers will also share their accounts, and President Joe Biden is expected to deliver remarks later today. The FDA\u2019s vaccine advisory board plans to meet today to discuss whether the Pfizer/BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine should be authorized for younger kids. Once the FDA makes its authorization, the issue goes to the CDC\u2019s vaccine advisory group, which is set to meet November 2 and 3. In Europe, countries are looking uneasily toward another pandemic winter. Europe is the only region in the world reporting an increase in Covid-19 cases right now. Vaccination rates vary widely there, from as low as 24% in some eastern areas to a 74.6% average among EU nations and an 85% rate in Belgium. Some Eastern European countries like Latvia and Romania are imposing new lockdowns, curfews and other measures. Moscow is also in the middle of a 10-day lockdown as Russia faces its worst pandemic phase ever. The CDC has updated its recommendations for the Pfizer/BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine booster to include children as young as 12, at least five months after they finish their primary set of shots. Separately, a bipartisan groups of senators floated the idea of more Covid-19 relief as event cancellations, closures and travel woes pile up due to skyrocketing Omicron cases. However, the talks failed to move forward. A series of news stories dubbed \u201cThe Facebook Papers\u201d \u2013 based on thousands of internal company documents \u2013 reveals how the platform has been used to sow political discord and extremism across the world, facilitate human trafficking, push hate speech and misinformation, and organize events like the January 6 insurrection. The documents also reveal that Facebook leaders sometimes knew to some extent the damage being caused by users. The Facebook Papers represents another crisis for the social media giant, which is already under scrutiny from the Senate and some within the company\u2019s own ranks. It\u2019s being published by a consortium of 17 US news organizations, including CNN. The documents were included in disclosures made to the Securities and Exchange Commission and provided to Congress in redacted form by Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen\u2019s legal counsel. A state of emergency has been declared in Kazakhstan after days of violent political unrest prompted by anger over increasing fuel prices, poor living standards and corruption. Protesters have set fire to city buildings and stormed the airport in the country\u2019s biggest city, Almaty. The Prime Minister and the government resigned during the chaos, causing even more tension. The public is now dealing with a nationwide internet blackout, and a Russian-led military alliance has reportedly deployed \u201cpeacekeeping\u201d personnel to help stabilize the situation. Russia and China recently joined forces for a naval exercise in which a flotilla of vessels nearly circled Japan\u2019s main island. The countries say the joint show of force was meant to ensure stability in a volatile region. However, Japan may not see it that way, and analysts say the demonstration might enhance claims by the Japanese government that the country needs to spend more to counter Chinese aggression. Russia and China have an ongoing military partnership and have conducted drills and other displays together for years. This exercise, however, was characterized by one Japanese official as \u201cunusual\u201d and comes at a time of rising tensions between China and Japan. China\u2019s recent aggression in the area, including its military pressure on nearby Taiwan, has put Japan on the defensive. Babies, pregnant women and nursing mothers are among the 97 hostages that have been freed in a series of rescue operations in northern Nigeria. Local police and the military collaborated on the raids, which targeted two well-known kingpins known for kidnapping in the area. Authorities say the hostages were held captive for more than two months. About $24 billion in goods is estimated to be sitting outside California\u2019s two biggest ports as the shipping backup there continues to put pressure on an already-brittle supply chain. This animated time lapse shows how ships have to circle and circle the ports, waiting to dock. The problem extends far beyond California, though. Goldman Sachs estimates that, nationwide, the time it takes loaded ships to make it through US ports has tripled from historical norms. Officials have warned that the supply chain crisis, which has led to massive price increases on consumer goods, could last through the first half of 2022. Meanwhile, the related worker shortage issue is hitting American companies hard. In a recent national survey, 47% of businesses reported a shortage of skilled workers in the third quarter. Canada has announced a total of $31.5 billion in compensation for First Nations children who were taken from their families and put into the country\u2019s child welfare system. Half of the money will go toward the potentially hundreds of thousands of children affected, and the other half will be used to reform the system that failed them. Indigenous and human rights organizations have long said such systems discriminate against First Nations children.

            "article_content": "Both the House of Representatives and the Biden administration asked the Supreme Court on Thursday to deny former President Donald Trump\u2019s attempt to keep secret more than 700 pages of records that pertain to January 6. RELATED: Why the new legal attack from Trump allies against the House January 6 committee is a long shot The House select committee argues that it desperately needs the papers for its sprawling probe into the deadly insurrection, and that Trump hasn\u2019t shown how he would be harmed enough to keep the records from being released. And the Biden administration is defending its decision that White House records from January 6 shouldn\u2019t be protected by executive privilege. Trump has disagreed, and his insistence on secrecy prompted him to sue in October. Trump wants Supreme Court to read Washington Post interview with Bennie Thompson The case, a major one on presidential authority and executive privilege as well House investigations, raises unsettled questions about the power of a former president to control information from his White House, even when the current administration and Congress support transparency for the records. \u201cAllowing a former President to override the decisions of an incumbent President would be an extraordinary intrusion into the latter\u2019s ability to discharge his constitutional responsibilities,\u201d lawyers from the Justice Department wrote in the filing on Thursday. They represent the National Archives, which currently possesses the Trump-era White House documents. With congressional elections in November 2022 and the possibility Democrats will lose control of the House, the select committee argued time is of the essence. \u201cThe Select Committee\u2019s authorization will expire on January 3, 2023, and each passing day handicaps the Select Committee\u2019s investigation, forcing it to proceed without the benefit of documents to which it is entitled,\u201d lawyers for the House wrote on Thursday. RELATED: Trump wants Supreme Court to read Washington Post interview with Bennie Thompson Why the new legal attack from Trump allies against the House January 6 committee is a long shot Their responses come a week after Trump asked the justices to look at the case, and to keep the records secret while the case is before the court. And both the House and the administration now repeatedly hint at the possibility that the House committee believes it has more to uncover about federal officials\u2019 discussions to block Congress from certifying Joe Biden\u2019s presidential win \u2013 even possible malfeasance by top officials. \u201cFar from \u2018fishing,\u2019 or looking to the former President and his advisors as a \u2018case study,\u2019\u201d DOJ writes, using Trump\u2019s team\u2019s words against him, \u201cthe Committee is investigating events involving [Trump] and other White House officials that have an identifiable factual foundation and relate to a specific, unprecedented attack on the Capitol. That investigation unquestionably serves legitimate legislative purposes. And contrary to [Trump]\u2019s contentions, those legislative purposes are sufficient to support the Committee\u2019s request even if some Members [of Congress] also believe that the investigation may \u2018disclose crime or wrongdoing.\u2019\u201d The Justice Department also argues that the White House\u2019s recent negotiations with the House to withdraw or defer requests for some national security records show the committee has narrowed some of its requests. Previously, both the White House and the House have faced criticism for Biden\u2019s willingness to disclose records from the West Wing, and about the large amount of material the committee is pursuing. Trump \u201cdoes not argue that even a single page of those records is beyond the scope of the Committee\u2019s legitimate inquiry,\u201d the Justice Department also wrote. \u201cPresident Biden has not strayed from protecting those interests\u201d of the presidency protecting communications around the President. In dispute in Trump\u2019s case are hundreds of documents related to his response to the election and January 6, including activity logs, schedules, speech notes from top advisers to the then-President and three pages of handwritten notes from then-White House chief of staff Mark Meadows. If the House obtains the records, they could help investigators answer some of the most closely guarded facts of what happened inside the West Wing as Trump\u2019s team discussed throwing out several states\u2019 popular votes from the 2020 election, and as supporters gathered and overran the US Capitol on January 6. The House noted on Thursday it\u2019s seeking documents that date back to April 2020, because that is when Trump first began to talk about the possibility of voter fraud corrupting the election. He continued to make that accusation even after last November, when several federal and state authorities determined there was no widespread election fraud in 2020. The January 6 committee formed 6 months ago. Here's what it's uncovered. \u201cThe Select Committee needs information relating to various individuals involved in the messaging during that period to determine when and how the seeds for the January 6 attack on our democracy were planted, which may aid Congress\u2019s consideration of remedial legislation,\u201d the House argues in its filings. Other documents the House seeks from the Trump White House closer to January 6 connect to people with ties to accused insurrectionists or the \u201cStop the Steal\u201d group, or who were working with Congress, security or visiting the White House near that day, the new filings say. The National Archives has pointed out that White House records, even about January 6, are always destined to become public documents after a president leaves office, and some of what Trump is trying to protect have routinely been released publicly by other White Houses. Trump resoundingly lost his arguments at both the trial court and appeals court levels. Yet while the Archives had initially planned to give the House committee the records starting in November, Trump\u2019s court fight put the document productions on ice. If the justices don\u2019t agree to look at the case in January, they may not discuss Trump\u2019s filings until a month later, in mid-February, the House has said. Though the Supreme Court has taken months to consider major separation of powers questions in congressional subpoena challenges from Trump in the past, they quickly rejected an attempt by Texas that Trump supported to overturn his electoral loss a year ago.",

            "article_content": "The House select committee investigating January 6 has stood down on its requests for some documents from the Trump White House after negotiations with the Biden administration. The White House said some of the records the House asked for potentially could concern state secrets or executive privilege because they were part of high-level national security deliberations, according to a letter from the White House counsel\u2019s office released Tuesday. The House said it would \u201cdefer\u201d its requests for those records. Another set of the documents that the House dropped pursuing may not have been all that helpful anyway because while they were created on dates the committee asked for, they did not pertain to the panel\u2019s investigation, the White House letter said. As a result, the committee won\u2019t be getting hundreds of pages of National Security Council records at this time. The revelation comes in a new round of letters about the status of Trump-era documents held by the National Archives. It\u2019s the first time the Biden administration appears to have pushed back on more than a handful of pages of documents requested by the House select committee, as the National Archives works through thousands of pages of records from the Trump administration. Some Trump allies slow walk, stonewall or snub January 6 committee The White House made clear in its letter it\u2019s still supportive of the House\u2019s inquiry on January 6, and that the latest deal over documents shouldn\u2019t \u201ccompromise its ability to complete its critical investigation expeditiously.\u201d The curtailing of the House panel\u2019s request will likely not affect its core mission of understanding then-President Donald Trump\u2019s attempts to overturn the 2020 presidential vote and the insurrection at the US Capitol on January 6. That\u2019s because this latest round of documents over which Congress and the executive branch negotiated \u201cappear to have no content that might be material to the Select Committee\u2019s investigation,\u201d the Biden White House said in a letter this month. \u201cPresident Biden recognizes that Congress has a compelling need, in service of its legislative functions, to understand the circumstances that led to the insurrection,\u201d wrote Jonathan Su, a lawyer for the Biden White House. \u201cThe documents for which the Select Committee has agreed to withdraw or defer its request do not appear to bear on the White House\u2019s preparations for or response to the events of January 6, or on efforts to overturn the election or otherwise obstruct the peaceful transfer of power.\u201d January 6 committee eyes interim report by summer 2022 The House is still seeking \u2013 and the Biden administration is willing to release \u2013 more than 700 pages of crucial Trump White House records documenting Trump\u2019s and top advisers\u2019 discussions, phone calls and visits up to and on January 6. But Trump filed a lawsuit to block their release and continues to claim that several hundred pages should be kept private, under his assertions of executive privilege. He is asking the Supreme Court to hear his case, after losing at two lower courts. Before this month, the National Archives had processed and weighed the positions of Trump and of the current White House on at least four separate collections of documents. As the review of records continued at the archives, the Biden administration in recent weeks looked at 511 pages from the National Security Council during Trump\u2019s presidency, as the House committee has been seeking a broad swath of documents from the former President\u2019s time in office. \u201cThe Select Committee has agreed to withdraw or defer its request for a significant portion of those records,\u201d White House counsel Dana Remus wrote to the archives on December 17. The committee issued a statement later Tuesday, making clear that it wasn\u2019t dropping parts of its pursuit. \u201cThe Select Committee welcomes President Biden\u2019s decision to clear the way for the production of another set of records,\u201d a committee spokesperson said in the statement. \u201cThe committee has agreed to defer action on certain records as part of the accommodations process, as was the case with an earlier tranche of records. The Select Committee has not withdrawn its request for these records and will continue to engage with the executive branch to ensure the committee gets access to all the information relevant to our probe.\u201d Even so, the committee could face a drawn-out negotiation with the Biden administration if it does still push for access to national security records, either because of potential standoffs over executive privilege or issues related to classified or law-enforcement sensitive material, the White House suggested in its letter. There was a previous situation in October where the House committee backed off pursuing a much smaller collection of January 6 documents, as it headed to court against Trump, and without the same level of public explanation from the Biden White House.

            "article_content": "When the committee investigating the January 6 insurrection struggled to serve Dan Scavino with a subpoena, the former Donald Trump aide said he had been in a fairly obvious locale: Mar-a-Lago. \u201cThe dangerous and false narrative of me trying to avoid or evade a subpoena is a disgrace,\u201d Scavino tweeted in October. \u201cNot ONE attempt was made to contact/serve me when I was at Mar a Lago for 6 days or home in NY for 8 days thereafter!\u201d One of the first witnesses the House select committee subpoenaed in September for information leading up to and during the events of January 6, Scavino was eventually served. He hired a savvy lawyer, quietly engaged with the committee and still has not offered testimony. With his witness status in limbo, he\u2019s still appearing in public alongside Trump. Scavino is just one of the many Trump allies to slow walk, stonewall or snub the January 6 committee \u2013 all while doubling down on their allegiance to Trump. Sources tell CNN it\u2019s a balancing act for Trump loyalists trying to decide whether to cooperate with the congressional investigation seeking to understand the events that unfolded on January 6 and prevent further assaults on democracy. Some have quietly provided documents and testimony. But nearly a dozen others have filed lawsuits challenging the committee\u2019s legitimacy. For some Trump allies, the legal ramifications or risk to their reputations is worth the cost of trying to stay in Trump\u2019s good graces as he eyes another run for the White House. Those would-be witnesses are still popping up at Mar-a-Lago, bragging about their conversations with the former President and predicting his return to the Oval Office. \u201cThat is 100% of the calculation,\u201d said Alyssa Farah, a CNN political commentator and former Trump communications director who cooperated with the committee and gave a deposition. \u201cWhat is the death grip on the Republican Party right now is the idea of Donald Trump running again in 2024, and people not wanting to risk losing their stature with him.\u201d A Trump spokesman did not respond to a request for comment. A spokesperson for the committee said the panel is\u201dworking to provide the American people with answers about a violent attack on democracy.\u201d \u201cThe hundreds of witnesses who have provided information to the Select Committee so far have done so voluntarily or are following the law and complying with a Select Committee subpoena,\u201d the spokesperson said. \u201cThose trying to obstruct the committee\u2019s work face a simple decision: change course and cooperate or risk enforcement action.\u201d Scavino first met Trump when he was a 16-year-old working at a New York golf course. He has since spent decades at Trump\u2019s side, rising to social media director and deputy chief of staff when Trump was in the White House. These days, he\u2019s still sticking closely to the former President. In December, Scavino announced on social media that he was headed to Mar-a-Lago, later posting a photo from an event there. When Trump traveled to Atlanta for Game 4 of the World Series and took part in the controversial \u201cTomahawk Chop,\u201d Scavino was in the private box along with him. When Trump appeared at an Iowa rally in October, he tore into the committee: \u201cThe left\u2019s new obsession is the un-select committee,\u201d Trump told the crowd. \u201cThey have an un-select committee.\u201d Scavino, whose attorney declined to comment for this story, was there as well \u2013 sharing the view behind the rope line with his social media followers. Roger Stone, a longtime Trump ally and sometimes political adviser who was subpoenaed by the committee, opted for another route to avoid answering questions: He invoked his right against self-incrimination, pleading the Fifth Amendment. \u201cI question the legitimacy of this inquiry,\u201d Stone said, after emerging from his December meeting with the House select committee, where investigators had hoped to learn more about Stone\u2019s activities at a January 5 rally, among other queries. \u201cThis is witch hunt 3.0.\u201d Stone has a fraught history with congressional investigations. After his last appearance before lawmakers in 2017, during the Russia investigation, he was convicted of lying to Congress and witness tampering. Trump later pardoned him. In this case, Stone was quick to point out to reporters that he was not at the US Capitol on January 6 and insisted he played no part in planning the violence. During his rally appearance a day earlier, though, he repeated baseless claims the election was stolen and told attendees, \u201cI will be with you tomorrow shoulder to shoulder.\u201d \u201cJust because I know Donald Trump \u2013 and I\u2019ve known him for 40 years \u2013 just because I know a few guys who are members of Proud Boys, just because I came in contact with members of the Oath Keepers does not mean that I have full legal liability for everything that happened on January 6, which I know nothing about and I wasn\u2019t present for,\u201d Stone said at an event, according to a video posted on Facebook in September. Grant Smith, Stone\u2019s attorney, said, \u201cHe engaged with the Select Committee and appeared as required. \u2026 Mr. Stone has no knowledge of any of the events that led to the illegal acts that occurred at the Capitol that day.\u201d Stone, meanwhile, has continued professing his support for Trump. He appeared at a December event at Mar-a-Lago, grinning widely in a photo posted by another guest on social media. In late November, Stone posted on his social media that he had a \u201cgreat chat\u201d with Trump. \u201cDonald Trump is my first, second and third choice for 2024,\u201d Stone wrote. Operatives like Stone and Scavino have become so enmeshed with Trump\u2019s brand it\u2019s perhaps unsurprising that they\u2019re sticking by him, Farah said. \u201cThere\u2019s a certain sect of the Republican Party and those close to the former President, who never want to fall out of his good graces,\u201d Farah said. \u201cWhere else are they going to go? He\u2019s their lifeline.\u201d While there is likely little the January 6 committee can do about witnesses broadly invoking the Fifth Amendment, other potential witnesses could pay a higher personal cost for their fealty to Trump. Former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows handed thousands of documents to the committee. But he balked at testifying about his knowledge of efforts to overturn the election and the events leading up to and during the January 6 insurrection, insisting on shielding some of his conversations with the former President under claims of executive privilege. The House voted to recommend the Department of Justice pursue criminal contempt charges against Meadows. A fixture in Trump\u2019s orbit, Meadows was spotted at a November event at Mar-a-Lago, more than a month after he was subpoenaed. But his relationship with Trump grew strained amid the fallout from some of the documents Meadows turned over to the select committee as well a book Meadows penned with embarrassing revelations about Trump, a source told CNN. Meadows has since sued the committee and used right-wing media appearances to lavish Trump with praise and attempt to rewrite the history of January 6, insisting Trump acted swiftly to keep people safe, despite the evidence to the contrary. \u201cThis is about Donald Trump and about actually going after him once again,\u201d Meadows said in a December Fox News interview. A representative for Meadows declined to comment. For Steve Bannon, a right-wing firebrand and Trump\u2019s former White House strategist, his resistance to the committee might as well be a badge of support for the Trump movement. Investigators hoped to question Bannon about his alleged efforts to encourage Trump to focus on January 6 and other events leading up to that day, including his remark on January 5 that, \u201cAll hell is going to break loose tomorrow.\u201d After defying a subpoena from the committee, Bannon was charged with criminal contempt of Congress and has pleaded not guilty. He declined to comment. It was Bannon\u2019s second federal indictment in two years. Although the last time he faced charges, Trump pardoned him. While Bannon\u2019s relationship with Trump often runs hot and cold, Bannon has made clear his loyalty still lands with the former President. He has used his podcast to encourage Trump supporters \u2013 particularly ones who incorrectly believe the 2020 election was stolen \u2013 to run for higher office, snap up spots on local school boards and become election officials. In a recent podcast episode, Bannon predicted it was only a matter of time before Trump returned to the Oval Office. \u201cWe\u2019re going to hit the beach and you\u2019ll have the landing teams, the beachhead teams and all that nomenclature they use when President Trump wins again in 2024 \u2014 or before,\u201d he said.

            "article_content": "Nearly a year after his failed coup attempt, Donald Trump\u2019s habit of putting his own political gain over truth is playing out again as the ex-commander-in-chief and his associates seek to delay and defy the House select committee probing the January 6 insurrection. Trump\u2019s campaign of obstruction, which has now reached the Supreme Court, raises questions about whether the panel, already facing a racing clock ahead of next year\u2019s midterms, will fulfill its goal of a historic accounting of his efforts to overturn the election. Trump\u2019s inner circle is locked into a strategy of preventing a comprehensive reckoning over one of the most notorious days ever in the United States and seeking to whitewash history as he readies an apparent new run for the White House. The panel\u2019s attempt to reach deep into Trump world and behind the scenes in the West Wing on January 6 kicked into higher gear in the days before Christmas, offering new insight into its areas of focus. Trump responded by stepping up his own strategy of defying the truth. It is now clear committee members are trying to build a detailed picture of exactly what Trump said, did and thought in the days leading up to the insurrection and in the hours when it raged on Capitol Hill after he incited the mob with fresh election fraud lies. January 6 committee ramps up efforts to uncover funding behind Capitol riot For the first time, the panel publicly called for testimony from lawmakers closely bound up in Trump\u2019s effort to discredit the 2020 election and cling to power. It asked Rep. Scott Perry to talk about his effort to install Jeffrey Clark, an official who wanted the Justice Department to pursue Trump\u2019s lies about electoral fraud as attorney general. The Pennsylvania Republican declined, arguing the panel was illegally constituted \u2013 even though it was created by a vote in the full House. The committee also asked another Trump crony, Rep. Jim Jordan, to discuss what it says are his multiple communications with the ex-President on January 6. The Ohio Republican has yet to respond, but his loyalty to Trump and fierce attacks on the committee suggest he\u2019s unlikely to be a cooperative witness. Committee members could soon face the decision of whether to subpoena Perry and Jordan, a move that would be certain to further worsen incendiary relations between Democrats and Republicans in the House. The Democratic-led body has already sent criminal referrals to the Justice Department dealing with two witnesses who refused to submit to subpoenas \u2013 Trump political guru Steve Bannon, who has already been indicted, and former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows. There are also new insights emerging from court documents involving Trump spokesman Taylor Budowich, which show that the committee is expanding its investigation into the financing of pro-Trump rallies leading up to the riot \u2013 including the one in Washington, DC, on January 6 at which the then-President told his supporters to \u201cfight like Hell\u201d and which evolved into the insurrection. Trump associates who don\u2019t want to testify are relying on his expansive claims of executive privilege, which many legal scholars view as dubious, to avoid saying what they know about the Capitol insurrection. Two days before Christmas, Trump, who has a long history in and out of office of using the legal system to avoid and delay accountability, went to the Supreme Court, appealing to the conservative-majority he helped construct to block the release of White House documents to the committee. Trump asked the nation\u2019s top bench to conduct a full review of the case to stop the release of speech notes, activity logs and schedules and to put a lower court ruling allowing them to be handed over on hold. House panel asks Supreme Court to say by mid-January whether it's taking Trump's January 6 records case The committee quickly responded, seeking to head off an attempt by the former President to jam it in a long legal battle, asking the court to say by the middle of next month whether it is taking the case. Trump\u2019s legal team argues that it is vital for future presidents to be confident that their deliberations with advisers will be kept confidential even when they have left office. But President Joe Biden, with whom questions of asserting executive privilege now rest, has argued that it is vital for the nation to achieve an understanding of what went on during the Capitol riot and has refused Trump\u2019s claims. The idea that the twice-impeached former President is acting in defense of the office that he often compromised with abuses of power and used to pursue personal goals is hard to read with a straight face. But it threatens to unleash a constitutional wrangle that could frustrate the committee\u2019s attempts to clarify Trump\u2019s intentions and actions on January 6. The committee does not have the luxury of time. It is already clear that Republicans, who have a good chance of taking back the House in November\u2019s midterm elections, will shut down the panel as soon as they have power. House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy has anchored his bid to become speaker on Trump\u2019s patronage after briefly suggesting the then-President bore responsibility for the riot of his supporters at the Capitol. Among his services to Trump was help in thwarting plans for an independent 9/11-style commission to probe the worst attack on US democracy in modern history. McCarthy also leads a party that has ostracized the Republican members of the select committee, Reps. Liz Cheney of Wyoming and Adam Kinzinger of Illinois \u2013 two staunch conservatives who have been willing to tell the truth about what happened. Kinzinger is not running for reelection while Cheney is facing a Trump-backed primary challenger. Another Republican who voted to impeach Trump over the insurrection, Rep. Fred Upton, has also drawn a primary challenger endorsed by the ex-President who has given credence to election fraud lies. Biden's struggles shouldn't eclipse GOP's year of dangerous falsehoods \u201cI watched people go down the Mall, and I saw them come back,\u201d the Michigan congressman told CNN\u2019s Dana Bash on \u201cState of the Union\u201d Sunday, describing his experience on January 6. \u201cAnd I heard the noises and obviously was watching what happened. But it was real and shocking and \u2026 it was a scary day.\u201d Upton\u2019s unwillingness to buy into Trump\u2019s personality cult, which requires fact-defying obeisance to fantasies of a stolen election, could cost him his political career. If so, he will join the growing list of Republicans drummed out of power by the former President in an operation that ensures a possible future House GOP majority will be in his thrall and is likely to be a weaponized force for Trumpism as the 2024 presidential election looms. From the outside, it is difficult to tell how deeply the House select committee has managed to penetrate what was happening in Trump\u2019s West Wing on January 6. While several prominent associates of the ex-President are refusing to testify, the committee has conducted several hundred interviews with people inside and outside the former administration. Not everyone has the political commitment or the financial resources to enter a legal battle by defying a subpoena. And details from the lawsuit that emerged on Christmas Eve showed that Budowich had supplied the committee with more than 1,700 pages of documents and provided about four hours of testimony. He sued on Friday night to stop the committee from obtaining records from a bank. The previously undisclosed records request is another indication the committee has made substantial behind-the-scenes progress and could at least partially derail Trump\u2019s cover-up despite his best efforts. It is a measure of the horror of January 6 \u2013 now nearly a year on \u2013 that new details of the frantic, dangerous hours on Capitol Hill and the heroism of police officers insulted by the GOP\u2019s attempt to deny history, are still emerging. The Justice Department last week released vivid video of a three-hour battle in which rioters brandished weapons and officers were severely beaten in a tunnel on Capitol Hill. The video, taken from a Capitol security camera, was released after CNN and other news outlets sued for access. It showed pro-Trump rioters jabbing police with flag poles, using pepper spray and crushing an officer in a door. Metropolitan Police Officer Michael Fanone was pulled out of the police line and into the crowd by a rioter who had his arm around his neck. The video shows Fanone eventually falling down and disappearing into the mass of rioters, where he said he was tased in the neck, beaten with a flagpole and heard rioters screaming \u201ckill him with his own gun.\u201d Fanone said he suffered a heart attack and fell unconscious during the attack. Yet Trump, who issued a series of delusional statements last week and promises a press conference on the anniversary of the January 6 riot, maintains \u201cthe insurrection took place on November 3rd, it was the completely unarmed protest of the rigged election that took place on January 6.\u201d The power of that lie, and the ex-President\u2019s apparent determination to win back power on the strength of it in 2024, shows why the House select committee\u2019s effort to expose the truth is so important.",

            "article_content": "A version of this story appeared in CNN\u2019s What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here. There are things that former President Donald Trump wants to talk about, like vaccines, and things he\u2019d rather keep quiet, like what exactly happened in the White House leading up to January 6. Trump got more vocal this week on Covid-19 vaccines, pushing them to supporters, correcting some misinformation and making clear they protect against Covid-19 hospitalizations and deaths. He\u2019s also seeking personal credit for vaccine development and telling his supporters they should get the shot, even if he agrees they should have a right to not get it. When the conservative podcast host Candace Owens raised doubts about the efficacy of the vaccine during an interview with Trump, he corrected her. The best thing Donald Trump has done in years \u201cWell, no, the vaccine works,\u201d he said. \u201cThe ones that get very sick and go to the hospital are the ones that don\u2019t take their vaccine. But it\u2019s still their choice, and if you take the vaccine, you are protected.\u201d Owens released excerpts of the interview days after Trump had faced a smattering of boos from supporters when he talked during a Q&A with former Fox News host Bill O\u2019Reilly about getting a booster shot. The two have been on a tour together with stops in Florida and Texas, but the boos from a friendly crowd and the pushback over the vaccine suggest some space on the issue of Covid between Trump and some conservatives. President Joe Biden and Trump even offered some kind words for each other on the topic of vaccines this week. \u201cThanks to the prior administration and our scientific community, America is one of the first countries to get the vaccine,\u201d Biden said at the White House. Trump admitted to Fox News that he had been \u201csurprised\u201d and \u201cappreciative\u201d and, at least at that moment, found it hard to criticize Biden. Imagine if Trump had taken this vocally pro-vaccine stance some months ago, building trust in the vaccine back then instead of making statements like this: \u201cPeople are refusing to take the Vaccine because they don\u2019t trust his Administration, they don\u2019t trust the Election results, and they certainly don\u2019t trust the Fake News, which is refusing to tell the Truth,\u201d he said in a statement back in July as the Delta variant was taking hold. Trump's endorsement of vaccines aligns with most Republicans' views -- but it may be an uphill battle to convince the holdouts Trump has previously pushed Americans to get vaccinated, but he hasn\u2019t exactly shouted from the rooftops about it. He kept his own vaccination quiet until after he left office. CNN\u2019s Veronica Stracqualursi and David Wright note that Trump has \u201cfrequently politicized the development and rollout of the vaccines and told The Wall Street Journal in September that he was unlikely to get a booster shot. He was also inconsistent on promoting science-backed recommendations to slow the spread of the virus and pushed disproven treatments for Covid-19.\u201d Now, however, he\u2019s taking personal credit. \u201cI came up with a vaccine, with three vaccines. All are very, very good. Came up with three of them in less than nine months,\u201d he told Owens. Unfortunately, his previous attitude probably influenced \u2013 or was influenced by \u2013 mistrust of vaccines among Republicans. Four in 10 Republicans remain unvaccinated, much less boosted, according to November data from the Kaiser Family Foundation. While most Republicans, like most Americans, are either completely or partially vaccinated, it\u2019s also true that most unvaccinated Americans either belong to or lean to the GOP, according to CNN\u2019s Ariel Edwards-Levy. She cites research that suggests not even Trump\u2019s endorsement is likely to change the minds of holdouts. A much larger portion of Republicans \u2013 72% in a recent NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll \u2013 may have been influenced by Trump\u2019s conspiracy theory about the 2020 election and don\u2019t trust that the results were accurate. The election lie may be Trump\u2019s favorite thing to talk about publicly. And vaccines are something he\u2019ll now defend. But he\u2019s also trying to keep some other things quiet this week. His lawyers asked the Supreme Court to shield him from having to turn over documents and communications related to the January 6 insurrection. The House committee investigating the insurrection is poised, after court wins, to get the documents from the National Archives. But Trump on Thursday asked justices at the highest court for help, demanding that they honor his claim of executive privilege even though he is no longer in office. Trump wants to keep about 700 pages of documents secret, according to CNN\u2019s report, \u201cincluding activity logs, schedules, speech notes and three pages of handwritten notes from then-White House chief of staff Mark Meadows \u2013 paperwork that could reveal goings-on inside the West Wing as Trump supporters gathered in Washington and then overran the US Capitol, disrupting the certification of the 2020 vote.\u201d Breaking with recent tradition, Biden has refused to assert executive privilege on Trump\u2019s behalf. While he wants to keep documents sealed, Trump continues to talk, whenever he can, about his fantasy that the 2020 election was stolen from him. There was a fascinating Washington Post report Thursday on how Trump\u2019s lie has continued to fester at the local and state levels as election skeptics push for more and new recounts, even in states Trump won easily. That\u2019s a disturbing trend for US democracy as election officials gear up for the 2022 midterm elections, when Republicans are expected to regain control of the House of Representatives, and look forward to the 2024 presidential election, which could well feature a rematch of Trump vs. Biden.",

            "article_content": "Former President Donald Trump appealed to the Supreme Court on Thursday to block the release of documents from his White House to the House committee investigating the January 6 riot at the Capitol, escalating his effort to keep about 700 pages of records secret. Hours after Trump\u2019s request was filed, the House committee asked the justices to expedite their consideration of the request, with a proposed schedule that would allow the court to say by the middle of next month whether it was taking up the case. The committee, which is charged with investigating the US Capitol attack to provide recommendations for preventing such assaults in the future, seeks the documents as it explores Trump\u2019s role in trying to overturn the election. That includes his appearance at a January 6 rally when he directed followers to go to the Capitol where lawmakers were set to certify the election results and \u201cfight\u201d for their county. The documents are currently held by the National Archives. In filings submitted to the Supreme Court on Thursday, Trump asked the justices to take up a full review of the case and he requested that while they consider his position, they put a hold on the lower court decision permitting the disclosure of his records while they consider taking up the case. \u201cThe limited interest the Committee may have in immediately obtaining the requested records pales in comparison to President Trump\u2019s interest in securing judicial review before he suffers irreparable harm,\u201d Trump\u2019s lawyers wrote in the court filings. At issue are hundreds of documents including activity logs, schedules, speech notes and three pages of handwritten notes from then-White House chief of staff Mark Meadows \u2013 paperwork that could reveal goings-on inside the West Wing as Trump supporters gathered in Washington and then overran the US Capitol, disrupting the certification of the 2020 vote. The records could answer some of the most closely guarded facts of what happened between Trump and other high-level officials, including those under siege on Capitol Hill on January 6. Trump is also seeking to keep secret a draft proclamation honoring two police officers who died in the siege and memos and other documents about supposed election fraud and efforts to overturn Trump\u2019s loss of the presidency, the National Archives has said in court documents. In its expedition request Thursday evening, the House committee said that any delay in the Supreme Court\u2019s consideration would \u201cinflict a serious injury on the Select Committee and the public.\u201d \u201cThe Select Committee needs the requested documents now to help shape the direction of the investigation and allow the Select Committee to timely recommend remedial legislation,\u201d the panel said. It said the committee and the Biden administration would file by December 30 their responses to Trump\u2019s request that the Supreme Court take up the case. The lawmakers are asking the Supreme Court to consider during its January 14 conference whether it will take up the case. The fight over the documents stems from a lawsuit Trump filed against the Archives as well as the House committee, seeking to stop the records\u2019 disclosure. Trump is arguing that those documents should remain secret under the former President\u2019s own assertions of executive privilege, though so far, lower courts have rejected his arguments. Thursday\u2019s filing with the Supreme Court marks an escalation of the dispute, in which President Joe Biden has determined that withholding the documents based on executive privilege is not in the interest of the United States. In a letter to the National Archives in October, White House Counsel Dana A. Remus said that the President had declined to assert privilege because Congress has a \u201ccompelling need in service of its legislative functions to understand the circumstances that led to these horrific events.\u201d In their filings with the Supreme Court Thursday, the former President\u2019s lawyers said that the House\u2019s request for the Trump White House documents was \u201cuntethered from any valid legislative purpose and exceeds the authority of Congress under the Constitution and the Presidential Records Act.\u201d Trump told the Supreme Court that the case posed \u201cnovel and important questions of law that the Court should resolve.\u201d \u201cWhile the protections of executive privilege and restrictions on access to presidential records are qualified, it is critical that future Presidents and their advisers understand the contours and perimeters of that privilege\u2014and its exceptions\u2014after the conclusion of a presidential term,\u201d Trump said in his request that the court take up the case. Previously, both a district court judge and the DC US Circuit Court of Appeals rejected Trump\u2019s arguments in decisions that backed the legitimacy of the document requests and the investigation more broadly. \u201cFormer President Trump has given this court no legal reason to cast aside President Biden\u2019s assessment of the Executive Branch interests at stake, or to create a separation of powers conflict that the Political Branches have avoided,\u201d the DC Circuit said in its opinion earlier this month. In its December 9 ruling against Trump, the appeals court gave him 14 days to request a Supreme Court intervention. In his application with Chief Justice John Roberts \u2013 who oversees emergency matters arising from the DC Circuit \u2013 to put the appeals court decision on hold, Trump said that allowing for the documents to be released before the Supreme Court considered the case would \u201cdetrimentally impact Presidential decisionmaking for all future Presidents.\u201d \u201cThere will not be another Presidential transition for more than three years; Congress has time to allow this Court to consider this expedited appeal,\u201d Trump wrote in the filing. Left unsaid was that Republicans are expected to take control of the House in next year\u2019s election and would likely end the House select committee\u2019s investigation.

            "article_content": "Michael Flynn, the embattled former national security adviser to former President Donald Trump, is suing to block a US House subpoena for his phone records. His lawsuit marks the eighth court challenge against the ability of the House select committee investigating the January 6 attack on the US Capitol to gather evidence on Trump\u2019s efforts to overturn the 2020 election. Flynn\u2019s lawsuit arrives just a day after he was scheduled to testify before the committee \u2013 and appears to be trying to hold off the consequence of his failure to appear, as well as any other fact-finding by the panel. While the court filing on Tuesday, in the Middle District of Florida federal court, says Flynn is primarily challenging a Verizon subpoena, it\u2019s not clear whether the committee has sought his or members of his family\u2019s phone records, as they\u2019ve done with dozens of people around Trump. The House separately subpoenaed Flynn in early November for him to turn over records he had related to the 2020 election, as well as demanding he testify. Flynn claims complying with the House\u2019s demands \u2013 either with the committee collecting his phone records or if he were to speak to them under subpoena \u2013 would violate his constitutional rights. Flynn\u2019s court filings characterize his lawsuit as a way \u201cto resolve the impasse \u2026 in order to facilitate his cooperation with the Committee.\u201d Flynn was initially in talks with the committee and was beginning to preserve and collect documents he had to share with them, his lawsuit says. And the committee had agreed to delay his deposition, setting it for Monday. Flynn then told them he planned to assert his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination, and didn\u2019t appear in person. Instead, he went to court, according to his lawsuit. In the lawsuit, he outlines how his failure to appear for testimony may be a sticking point with the committee \u2013 believing it could lead the House to vote to hold him in contempt. The panel has told him, according to his attorneys, that its \u201cpreference would be for General Flynn to invoke his 5th Amendment privilege before the Committee, even if it was effectively the only thing he could do, and that the Committee could refer General Flynn for prosecution for contempt of Congress for not doing so.\u201d Trump and several key people around him at the end of his presidential tenure are also putting up a fight against the committee\u2019s subpoenas. Those who have gone to court are: The bulk of the cases attack the committee\u2019s pursuits as overly broad or outside its authority. A ninth potential witness, former Trump adviser Steve Bannon, is in court as a criminal defendant after he opted not to comply with committee subpoenas. He had not sued. In cases regarding phone records, AT&T and Verizon notified customers when they received requests from the committee, advising them that their records would be handed over unless the person went to court. The phone companies have made clear that the content of communications is not part of the House\u2019s demands. Flynn, in his lawsuit, doesn\u2019t note whether he received a letter from the phone company acknowledging that the House had requested his records, as others had. Each of the Trump-connected witnesses makes different specific claims in court about why the House should be blocked, based on their unique situations, ranging from confidentiality allowances because of a person\u2019s profession as a lawyer or a journalist, to executive privilege. Though defendants like Flynn and Jones claim the courts should block subpoenas as a way to protect their Fifth Amendment rights, that protection only can be used when a person is testifying under oath or in an investigation. All of the lawsuits against the committee are in their earliest stages, except for Trump\u2019s. The ex-President has lost at both the trial court and appeals court levels, and is headed to the Supreme Court. The courts so far have determined Trump does not have the ability to block the House from his White House\u2019s records, and cannot claim presidential privilege when he is no longer president. The DC Circuit Court of Appeals has also signed off on the House\u2019s work, saying the panel\u2019s investigation could result in legislation. That part of their decision, in the Trump executive privilege case, essentially shuts down witnesses\u2019 arguments in court that are trying to claim the committee\u2019s subpoenas are not for a valid purpose.

            "article_content": "Tucked away in the back of an office in a Florida strip mall is a tidy storage room filled with hundreds of navy blue t-shirts, hats, flags and even Christmas decor. \u201cWe have ornaments,\u201d Tiffany Justice points out proudly, quick to show a version of a Thomas Jefferson quote on the ornament: \u201cGod that gave us life, gave us liberty.\u201d Liberty is a word she uses often. Justice and fellow mom Tina Descovich are the two women behind Moms for\u202fLiberty, a group of conservatives that came together in January\u202fto fight for\u202fparental\u202frights in Florida and has since spread across the country. They are now focusing on the 2022 midterm elections \u2013 from school board and county races to federal offices \u2013 and are harnessing a lot of the anti-government sentiment stoked by the coronavirus pandemic and public health orders. With the balance of power up for grabs in both the US House and Senate, analysts say \u201cparent power\u201d could become a potent national force after already impacting the Virginia gubernatorial election and local races last month. These two moms, both former school board members, joined forces when they say they found they had similar mounting frustrations about being unable to stop Covid-related mandates. They felt\u202ftoo much power was given to unions and school districts in the education system, they say, and that the system protects itself instead of helping students. \u201cI think Covid has allowed all of America to see behind the education curtain,\u201d Justice told CNN. \u201cSo, we just thought we could take the skills that we have learned and the inside information that we learned about the public education system to help parents advocate more effectively for their children.\u201d Florida Department of Education releases paychecks it withheld from school board members that implemented mask mandates The duo\u2019s initial goal was to establish 67 chapters, one in each Florida county. Two weeks after the organization launched, however, a mom from New York reached out, expressing interest in starting a chapter there, Descovich said. \u201cI said, \u2018Yes, let\u2019s do it,\u201d Justice said. \u201cFrom that moment on, it\u2019s been like a wildfire all across the country.\u201d The duo credits \u201cword of mouth\u201d for their growth, which has also spurred groups of parents who oppose their stance. The Moms for Liberty use social media and their website to spread their message. \u201cJust like with any successful organization or business or anyone that\u2019s successful, if you fill the need that\u2019s out there, people will be drawn to it,\u201d Descovich said. The organization grew exponentially in a matter of months, according to the founders, who say they now have 167 chapters across more than 30 states with 70,000 members. They say their goal is to have a Moms for Liberty chapter in every school district, showing up at every school board meeting in the country. With Moms for Liberty t-shirts that carry slogans such as \u201cWe do NOT CO-PARENT with the GOVERNMENT,\u201d members are taking to podiums at school board meetings and rallies to protest mask and vaccine mandates,\u202fmaterials in books and curriculum related to race and LGBTQ rights,\u202fand\u202fcritical race theory (CRT), among other concerns, including falling literacy rates. As the group gains momentum, the moms are turning their focus to expansion and elections. Next year, they say, will be the \u201cyear of the parent\u201d at the ballot box. \u201cWe want people to show up for that school board race that\u2019s at the bottom of the ballot and affect the ballot all the way up on education issues,\u201d Descovich said. Moms for Liberty has set up three political action committees and its chapters are now endorsing candidates in school board elections, although Descovich and Justice insist the group is\u202fnon-partisan. According to Descovich, the organization has \u201ccleared $300,000\u201d in funding through T-shirt sales, small donations and fundraising events. Moms for Liberty recently hired a part-time assistant and Descovich is now receiving a stipend\u202fas the executive director.\u202f The organization is so new, however, the chapter\u2019s tax records are not yet available. At one of the group\u2019s major fundraising events in June, sponsors included Florida Republicans running for office. They have also publicly praised Florida Republicans like Gov. Ron DeSantis, referring to him as \u201cthe Parents\u2019 Governor\u201d on social media. They\u2019ve appeared by his side for announcements at news conferences. In a statement to CNN, the governor\u2019s office applauded the moms\u202f\u201cfor speaking out and fighting for their right to be involved in their kids\u2019 education.\u201d \u201cWe haven\u2019t seen Democrat governors standing up for parental rights in this country, and I think that is going to be a rude awakening,\u201d Justice said. \u201cAnd I think what happened to Terry McAuliffe in Virginia is going to repeat and repeat.\u201d Capri Cafaro, a political commentator from American University\u2019s School of Public Affairs, says harnessing parent power could be key in 2022. She compares the group\u2019s growth to that of the conservative grassroots tea\u202fparty movement\u202fin 2009 and 2010.\u202f The tea party\u2019s platform focused on lower taxes and reducing the national debt through less government spending. Dozens of tea party-backed newcomers joined the GOP caucus, helping the Republicans win back the House in 2010. \u201cIt was kind of structured very similarly, seen as a grassroots movement with local chapters across the country,\u201d Cafaro said. \u201cI think that it is possible that an organization like Moms for Liberty could have an impact on the midterm elections and maybe even going into 2024, particularly because it is encapsulating in a very important demographic in the electorate which are women and mothers, particularly in an age demographic generically between like 25 to 35.\u201d The group is also energizing opponents.\u202fSupport Our Schools, a new group of parents in Florida, calls Moms for Liberty a danger to democracy. Black parents say movement to ban critical race theory is ruining their children's education \u201cThe disinformation that they have been putting out, and the vitriol towards marginalized groups, is a true danger to society, because we need to, we need to work together,\u201d said Support Our Schools co-founder Jules Scholls. Some members of Moms for Liberty insist masks can be harmful to children and don\u2019t work.  But \u202fstudies\u202fhave shown they are effective in preventing the spread of Covid-19. And they are\u202frecommended\u202ffor children over two years of age by the American Academy of Pediatrics to stop the spread of coronavirus. Diving into another hot-button issue, a Moms for Liberty chapter in New Hampshire offered\u202fa $500 bounty last month for anyone who turns in a teacher using CRT\u202fin the classroom. The founders said it was not an approach they planned to use nationally and admitted the chapter \u2018could have handled the issue better, but said they ultimately supported the moms\u2019 fight against CRT.\u202f Last June, New Hampshire Gov. Chris Sununu signed a bill banning public K-12 schools from teaching that any person or group is inherently oppressive, superior, inferior, racist, or sexist \u2013 one of the arguments made about CRT. When asked by CNN for examples of where CRT is taught in any K-12 classrooms, Descovich pointed to Charlotte-Mecklenburg Public Schools in North Carolina. A small-town mom wanted to help her community. And then the community took aim at her child In a statement to CNN, Charlotte-Mecklenburg Superintendent Earnest Winston said, \u201cOur schools do not teach and do not promote a doctrine of Critical Race Theory.\u201d Justice and Descovich later shared a video of a woman in a \u201cMoms for Liberty\u201d T-shirt apparently at a public meeting for Charlotte-Mecklenburg schools railing against a lesson she said her son had been assigned called \u201cMy Identity and My Bias.\u201d That woman said her son had been required to examine his white privilege and his male privilege. Like CRT, many of the issues taken up by Moms for Liberty are echoed by many on\u202fthe right, and, at times, have led to heated debates in school board meetings across the country. They have already proven to be campaign talking points and even a\u202fdriving force in some elections. If Moms for Liberty have it their way, voters will still have parents\u2019 rights top of mind the next time they head to the polls. \u201d\u202fI think that they certainly can become a political force to be reckoned with,\u201d Cafaro said.",

            "article_content": "President Joe Biden on Wednesday suggested Mark Meadows was \u201cworthy\u201d of being in held in contempt of Congress after the Democratic-controlled House referred the ex-White House chief of staff to the Department of Justice for failing to appear for a deposition with the committee investigating the January 6 attack on the US Capitol. The House formally referred Meadows, former President Donald Trump\u2019s final White House chief of staff, to the Department of Justice for criminal contempt of Congress in a 222-208 vote late Tuesday night. Two Republicans who sit on the select committee, Reps. Liz Cheney of Wyoming and Adam Kinzinger of Illinois, voted with all Democrats in favor of the referral. \u201cI don\u2019t know enough \u2013 just what I\u2019ve seen, I have not spoken to anyone. It seems to me he\u2019s worthy of being held in contempt,\u201d he said. The comment from Biden is notable given that the decision about whether to charge Meadows with criminal contempt of Congress is now in front of Attorney General Merrick Garland and the Department of Justice. Biden has repeatedly pledged to keep his Justice Department free from political influence after Trump spent years commenting on federal criminal cases and investigations, often being accused of using his platform to influence proceedings. On Monday, the House select committee unanimously voted in favor of holding Meadows in contempt of Congress and now it is up to the Justice Department to decide if it will pursue criminal charges against him. The vote was significant given Meadows\u2019 role as Trump\u2019s chief of staff and his intimate knowledge of efforts to overturn the 2020 election. Meadows is the second Trump associate to face such a referral from the panel. The committee approved a criminal contempt report against Trump ally Steve Bannon in October after he refused to comply with a subpoena deadline. Meadows has consistently insisted he wants to shield some of his conversations with the former President under claims of executive privilege but has already handed over thousands of documents which the panel says only adds to the need for him to testify. Among those documents have been stunning text messages that include messages from a Georgia government official sent to Meadows while Trump was on the phone with Georgia\u2019s secretary of state urging him to \u201cfind\u201d votes for Trump, as well as discussions of Trump\u2019s efforts to overturn his 2020 election loss to Biden. The committee also released a text Meadows sent to a member of Congress detailing Trump\u2019s views about Vice President Mike Pence and state legislatures trying to overturn the election result. When asked for a reaction to text messages sent to Meadows, Biden said Wednesday, \u201cI haven\u2019t seen them all.\u201d This story has been updated with more reporting. CNN\u2019s Jeremy Herb, Ryan Nobles and Zachary Cohen contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "The House of Representatives staked out a dramatic new defense of democracy by citing Mark Meadows for criminal contempt over his refusal to testify about Donald Trump\u2019s coup attempt on January 6. The move against the former White House chief of staff Tuesday was the latest effort to penetrate the inner circle of an ex-President who watched the US Capitol come under attack by a mob incited by his plot to overturn a fair election. But it also showed how the House select committee investigating the assault is now taking on a far more important role than simply documenting a day that will live in infamy. It has become a vital protagonist in the battle to save American democracy in the run-up to a presidential election in which Trump may try to reclaim power, through nefarious means if necessary. January 6 committee seeks accountability for 2020. Trump backers seek control of 2024 The contempt referral to the Justice Department, following an earlier similar citation against Trump\u2019s ex-political guru Steve Bannon, reflects growing momentum for the committee, which has called more than 300 witnesses to offer testimony and evidence. The investigation clearly has hidden depths. A flurry of texts to Meadows released by the panel, documenting panicked lawmakers, Fox News anchors and other members of the media, and even Trump\u2019s own son imploring him to call off the insurrection, hint at a mound of evidence collected but not yet made public. Not only does this trove apparently depict Trump\u2019s own dereliction of duty in defending lawmakers and the Constitution, it shows that those around the ex-President knew the damage he was doing in real time \u2013 though later tried to whitewash the truth. By exposing such duplicity, the committee is also building a picture of the cowardice, dishonesty and for-profit propagandizing by media personalities and Republican lawmakers bought into Trump\u2019s personality cult, which shored up the twice-impeached President during multiple assaults on the Constitution while he was in office. The same \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d industrial complex is now powering Trump\u2019s preparations for a new presidential run, which could threaten American political traditions even more seriously in 2024. The committee is racing against time, since Republicans will close it down if they win back the House in 2022. And it remains unclear whether voters will be swayed by learning the full, terrible truth about what happened on January 6 when they vote in midterm elections next year and in three years for president. Many other issues, including soaring inflation and a pandemic with no end in sight, rightly preoccupy Americans. A recent gubernatorial election in Virginia, in which Republicans prevailed by concentrating on education and the economy, suggested that fear of Trump is waning as a motivating factor at the ballot box. And democracy is often not a tangible commodity: The history of rising autocracy abroad suggests it\u2019s often not noticed until it\u2019s gone. Suggestions, meanwhile, the committee could even refer Trump for criminal charges, rooted partly in remarks by Republican Vice Chair Liz Cheney this week, still seem at the most daring end of the panel\u2019s possible options. 'Need to end this call': January 6 committee reveals new text messages to Meadows on House floor But as it builds a picture of what happened 11 months ago, the committee of seven Democrats and two Republicans who broke with the ex-President\u2019s cult, is also laying bare the character of Trump world. In that sense, its probe into a historic event is becoming perhaps the most important forward-looking weapon in a growing struggle to preserve democracy from the threat the ex-President still poses. \u201cHow we address January 6 is the moral test of our generation,\u201d Cheney, one of the few House Republicans to tell the truth about Trump\u2019s crimes against the Constitution, said before the vote to refer Meadows to the Justice Department for possible criminal action. With the exception of Cheney and fellow GOP committee member Adam Kinzinger of Illinois, the House voted on largely party lines to hold Meadows in contempt for backing out of offering testimony to the committee after providing thousands of pages of evidence including emails and text exchanges. Some of those messages show that he was inundated with calls by some of Trump\u2019s closest allies for the then-President to intervene during the insurrection. But Trump refused to do so for 187 minutes. In one exchange, the ex-President\u2019s son, Donald Trump Jr., told Meadows as the violence raged that his father needed to \u201ccondemn this sh*t ASAP,\u201d according to Cheney on Monday. In another message Cheney read, Fox News anchor Laura Ingraham, who later misled viewers about the true nature of the insurrection, wrote: \u201cMark, the President needs to tell people in the Capitol to go home. This is hurting all of us. He is destroying his legacy.\u201d Liz Cheney's latest move against Trump highlights her distinct path among Republicans On the face of it, Meadows is in a far stronger position than Bannon, who was not serving as a White House official at the time of the insurrection, to avoid testifying before the committee by asserting executive privilege, the tradition that presidents have an expectation of privacy in consultations with key aides. And there is no official closer to a president than the chief of staff. But the committee has argued that while it wanted broad testimony from Meadows, some of its requests were clearly not covered by executive privilege, especially since Meadows already turned over many of the documents they want to ask him about. And the panel says that the question of executive privilege does not arise uniformly since it wants to talk to Meadows about episodes that don\u2019t always involve Trump \u2013 like any interactions he had, for instance, with Republican officials in Georgia who were pressured by Trump to overthrow Biden\u2019s election win in the key swing state. In a new disclosure on Tuesday, California Rep. Zoe Lofgren revealed a text sent from an unnamed election official from the Peach State to Meadows as Trump leaned on Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger. \u201cNeed to end this call,\u201d the official said, according to Lofgren. Republicans have countered, however, that Trump\u2019s prerogative to assert executive privilege as a former president has still not been fully tested at the Supreme Court and that the committee was, therefore, overstepping its bounds with its contempt of Congress vote. But that argument from Trump allies is undermined by the fact that Meadows is apparently refusing to discuss events he already depicted in his new book. One committee member, Rep. Adam Schiff, argued that if Congress could not enforce its subpoena against Meadows, its future capacity to check an overreaching executive branch would be neutered. The dirty little secret the Mark Meadows texts reveal \u201cNo one is above the law,\u201d the California Democrat said. Some Trump allies in the House, including some suspected of being in contact with him on January 6, turned the tables to argue that the abuses of power were actually being committed by those investigating the insurrection \u2013 a flipping-of-the-script strategy perfected by the former President. Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio, for instance, described the job of the White House chief of staff as \u201cthe closest of the close\u201d in relation to the president and said it was in the \u201cpublic\u2019s interest\u201d for Meadows\u2019 dealings with Trump to be kept secret. Yet the then-chief of staff was not consulting Trump on a vital national security crisis or a national disaster. He was at his side when one of the worst assaults on America\u2019s political freedoms in generations was being perpetrated \u2013 arguably a far greater threat to the public interest than breaching the custom of presidential confidentiality. Another committee member, Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland, accused Meadows of changing his mind about cooperating with the committee only after incurring the fury of Trump over his memoir, which was released earlier this month. \u201cHe called his own book fake news, which is a pretty devastating review to render on your own book,\u201d Raskin said in a House floor debate on Tuesday. Meadows, a former congressman from North Carolina who, despite his staunch conservatism sometimes worked across the aisle, is the latest Trump acolyte to discover the choices and the consequences inherent in joining the former President\u2019s orbit. Multiple members of the Trump circle have been forced to decide between appeasing and abetting their boss\u2019 aberrant behavior and constitutional vandalism and their own reputations. Some, like Meadows, have faced the threat of criminal action as a result. Others, like former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani, have soiled their own considerable political legacies by embracing Trump\u2019s anti-democratic crusade. Several former campaign officials convicted during the Mueller probe spent time in jail because of their association with a boss who always tests the rule of law. Fact check: Several news outlets inaccurately reported key detail of Meadows story about Trump and protesters The hypocrisy of Fox News personalities, who pleaded with Meadows to end the insurrection in private but were unwilling to argue a similar line to their viewers, reveals they were loath to squander their ratings power and prominence with the former President\u2019s loyal base. Leading officials like House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, who once said Trump bore responsibility for the Capitol riot but then backtracked, know their chances of future power hinge on his patronage. McCarthy\u2019s quest to be speaker if Republicans win the House in 2022 is already in question as Trump\u2019s allies warn his obeisance to the former President is insufficiently fervent, despite his extensive efforts to ensure impunity for the coup attempt. With this in mind, the committee is uncovering not only Trump\u2019s transgressions in a historic purge against bedrock American political values, but evidence of his enduring power in the Republican Party and among his compliant, propagandistic conservative media enablers. It\u2019s underscoring the fact that far from ending on January 6, the threat to democracy that Trump represents builds by the day. Voters may decide that this is all insufficient to disqualify the former President from another tilt at the White House. But they won\u2019t be able to say they weren\u2019t warned.",

            "article_content": "The Democratic-controlled House voted Tuesday night to recommend that the Department of Justice pursue criminal charges against former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows for failing to appear for a deposition with the select committee investigating the January 6 attack on the US Capitol. The vote was 222-208. Two Republicans who sit on the select committee, Reps. Liz Cheney of Wyoming and Adam Kinzinger of Illinois, voted with Democrats in favor of the referral. On Monday, the House select committee unanimously voted in favor of holding Meadows in contempt of Congress and now it is up to the Justice Department to decide if it will pursue criminal charges against ex-President Donald Trump\u2019s former chief of staff. The vote, despite being pushed through by a Democratic majority, marks a significant moment in the January 6 investigation given Meadows\u2019 role as Trump\u2019s chief of staff and his intimate knowledge of efforts to overturn the 2020 election. Meadows is the second official to face such a referral from the panel. The committee approved a criminal contempt report against Trump ally Steve Bannon in October after he refused to comply with a subpoena deadline. Meadows has consistently insisted he wants to shield some of his conversations with the former President under claims of executive privilege but has already handed over thousands of documents which the panel says only adds to the need for him to testify. But so far, Meadows has refused to do so and his defiance is at the core of Tuesday\u2019s vote to refer him on criminal charges. \u201cThe select committee\u2019s report referring Mr. Meadows for criminal contempt charges is clear and compelling,\u201d Committee Chairman Bennie Thompson, a Democrat from Mississippi, said on Tuesday. \u201cAs White House chief of staff, Mr. Meadows played a role in or was witness to key events leading up to and including the January 6th assault on the United States Capitol.\u201d Donald Trump Jr. said his father needed to 'condemn' Capitol violence as it unfolded, Meadows' texts reveal Meadows\u2019 attorney issued a new statement Tuesday ahead of the full House vote saying that his client is still cooperating with the committee in some ways, but maintained he cannot be compelled to appear for questioning as he is not \u201clicensed to waive Executive Privilege\u201d claimed by Trump. Meadows \u201chas fully cooperated as to documents in his possession that are not privileged and has sought various means to provide other information while continuing to honor the former president\u2019s privilege claims,\u201d his attorney George J. Terwilliger III said in a statement. Republican Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming, the vice chair of the select committee, said Tuesday that Meadows had received numerous text messages urging Trump to take action to stop the riot that he has produced without any privilege claim. Later Tuesday, Thompson told CNN the committee will \u201cmake a decision within a week or so when to release\u201d the names of the authors of the texts to Meadows on January 6 after members referenced several messages exchanged between the former White House chief of staff and lawmakers as the riot unfolded. Thompson said committee members felt it was \u201cimportant\u201d to put the content out before releasing the names. \u201cThen we will do our own review on the committee as to if and when we will release them,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cWe will do it. I can\u2019t tell you exactly when that will be.\u201d Asked if there were any senators who were texting Meadows on January 6, Thompson revealed: \u201cAt this point, it is just House members.\u201d He also said the panel would likely notify the GOP members before it takes any action. Fox stays silent about new texts that expose Hannity and Ingraham's Jan. 6 hypocrisy The committee was ready to move forward with holding former Department of Justice official Jeffrey Clark in contempt but is giving him another chance to testify, as he says he plans to plead the Fifth. Meanwhile, the select committee continues its investigation, interviewing more witnesses on Tuesday, including former Vice President Mike Pence\u2019s onetime national security adviser Keith Kellogg. Last month, Kellogg became the first person in Pence\u2019s inner circle to be subpoenaed by the committee. In its letter to Kellogg, the committee specifically expressed interest in learning more about a January 2021 meeting with Trump and White House attorney Pat Cipollone, during which Trump insisted that Pence not certify the election, and any other meetings. The committee also stated in its letter that Kellogg had been at the White House on January 6 as the attack unfolded and has \u201cdirect information\u201d regarding Trump\u2019s \u201cstatements about and reactions to the Capitol insurrection.\u201d Kellogg is considered a key witness because of his proximity to Trump on January 6. The former President\u2019s then-national security adviser, Robert O\u2019Brien, was out of town that day. Kellogg\u2019s attorney told CNN on Tuesday his client is testifying and cooperating with investigators. The attorney also said Kellogg had not asserted executive privilege over testimony or documents. While a committee aide declined to comment on what had been asked or answered during the deposition, they did not refute the assertion that Kellogg is cooperating with the panel. The panel also spoke with Dustin Stockton, one of the organizers behind pro-Trump rallies that took place on January 5 and 6. Before meeting with the committee, Stockton\u2019s lawyer, Josh Nass, told reporters that his client has text messages and emails with people \u201cvery senior in the former President\u2019s orbit,\u201d as well as with members of Congress, that he would turn over to the committee Tuesday. Those lawmakers and people close to Trump \u201chave good reason to be quivering in their boots today,\u201d Nass said. \u201cWe\u2019re talking about all sorts of \u2026 email correspondences, text messages,\u201d he said. This story has been updated with additional developments Tuesday. CNN\u2019s Ryan Nobles, Kristin Wilson, Holmes Lybrand and Manu Raju contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "The House select committee investigating the January 6 attack on the US Capitol released new text messages obtained from former Trump White House chief of staff Mark Meadows that were sent to him in the days leading up to the insurrection and while the Capitol was under siege. The messages were read by committee members on the House floor Tuesday during debate over referring a criminal contempt of Congress against Meadows to the Justice Department. They included messages from a Georgia government official sent to Meadows while then-President Donald Trump was on the phone with Georgia\u2019s secretary of state urging him to \u201cfind\u201d votes for Trump, as well as discussions of Trump\u2019s efforts to overturn his 2020 election loss to Joe Biden. The committee also released a text Meadows sent to a member of Congress detailing Trump\u2019s views about Vice President Mike Pence and state legislatures trying to overturn the election result. Rep. Zoe Lofgren, a California Democrat on the select panel, read a text message from an unnamed Georgia government official sent to Meadows during the January 2 call. \u201cNeed to end this call,\u201d the official wrote. \u201cI don\u2019t think this will be productive for much longer.\u201d Rep. Adam Schiff, another California Democrat on the committee, read a text from an unknown number that applauded the potential appointment of Jeffery Clark to be acting attorney general while Trump tried to get the Justice Department to support his false claims of election fraud. Clark was one of the big proponents at the DOJ who was pushing to use the power of the department to investigate unfounded claims of voter fraud, but he was rebuffed by the department\u2019s leaders. \u201cI heard Jeff Clark is getting put in on Monday. That\u2019s amazing. It will make a lot of patriots happy, and I\u2019m personally so proud that you are at the tip of the spear, and I could call you a friend,\u201d the text to Meadows read. The January 6 committee members did not identify who sent Meadows the messages they revealed Tuesday. But they argued that the messages were part of a litany of evidence showing how Meadows was in contempt of Congress after he reversed his decision to cooperate with the committee\u2019s investigation. \u201cMr. Meadows received numerous text messages, which he has produced without any privilege claim, imploring that Mr. Trump take specific action we all know his duty required,\u201d said Republican Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming, one of two Republicans on the select committee. \u201cIndeed, some of those text messages, madam speaker, came from members in the chamber right now.\u201d On Monday, when the select committee approved its resolution holding Meadows in contempt, the panel revealed that Meadows had voluntarily provided scores of text messages he received on January 6, including from Fox News personalities, lawmakers and the then-President\u2019s son, Donald Trump Jr. Republicans bashed the committee for pursuing contempt charges against their former colleague, accusing them of threatening to put a former top White House official in prison to advance their political aims to harm Trump. The select committee members responded that Meadows was flouting the law by refusing to show up for testimony about material he had already turned over to them. They used the new text messages, which they displayed on the House floor, to argue there were plenty of topics they wanted to ask him about that would not be covered by executive privilege. Meadows\u2019 attorney had argued this week that his client \u201cmade a \u201cgood-faith invocation of executive privilege and testimonial immunity.\u201d California Democratic Rep. Pete Aguilar on Tuesday referenced a text message the committee had also included in its contempt report that was released Sunday, emphasizing that Meadows had messaged an unspecified member of Congress on January 3 about whether Pence could overturn the Electoral College results. In the text, according to the committee, Meadows recounted a direct communication with Trump who, according to Meadows in text messages, \u201cthinks the legislatures have the power but that the Vp has power too.\u201d Aguilar displayed a print of the reported text exchange while speaking before the House. In another text message from November 4, 2020, the day after the election, a member suggested to Meadows an \u201caggressive strategy\u201d for Republican-led state legislatures to \u201cjust send their own electors\u201d to Congress and let the Supreme Court decide who won the election. Another text message from a member to Meadows underscored how the committee has not received everything from the former White House chief of staff. \u201cPlease check your signal,\u201d the January 5 message said, a reference to the encrypted messaging application Signal. Democratic Rep. Bennie Thompson of Mississippi, the select committee\u2019s chairman, told CNN on Tuesday the panel will \u201cmake a decision within a week or so when to release\u201d the names of the authors of the texts to Meadows. At this point, he added, the panel had only identified House members who had sent their former House colleague text messages, and not Republican senators. Thompson said the committee felt it was \u201cimportant\u201d to first put the content out before making the names public. \u201cThen we will do our own review on the committee as to if and when we will release them,\u201d he said. \u201cWe will do it. I can\u2019t tell you exactly when that will be.\u201d This story has been updated with additional developments Tuesday.",

            "article_content": "Donald Trump Jr. was frantic. Fox News personalities who now dismiss the violence at the US Capitol were begging the White House to do something. On January 6, then-President Donald Trump wasn\u2019t listening to his kids or his media enablers. \u201cHe\u2019s got to condemn this sh*t ASAP,\u201d Trump\u2019s namesake son and chief cheerleader told then-White House chief of staff Mark Meadows via text that day, saying \u201cwe need an Oval office address.\u201d Rep. Liz Cheney, the vice chair of the House select committee investigating January 6, read the text aloud Monday night as the committee gathered to advance contempt of Congress charges against Meadows. It was one of a string of messages the former North Carolina congressman received from Trump Jr. and many others who now downplay the severity of the insurrection. But on that day, they were privately crying out for an Oval Office statement or anything by Trump to call off the rioters. Still, the then-President did nothing while the sacking of the Capitol carried on. Donald Trump Jr. said his father needed to 'condemn' Capitol violence as it unfolded, Meadows texts reveal By revealing these messages, the House panel pierced the fog of amnesia that has allowed conservative pundits and many Republicans to forget how serious the Capitol insurrection felt in real time, while also dealing a blow to Meadows\u2019 claims that he should not have to testify before the committee. Trump may have been the big voice perpetuating the lie about the 2020 presidential election, but what\u2019s clear from Monday\u2019s proceeding and from other reports dripping out of the investigation is that so many people were involved in his circle, which is only becoming more apparent and important as the investigation drags on. After months of behind-the-scenes investigation, committee members publicly laid out their extraordinary case that Meadows was an accessory to the insurrection and started the process of trying to make him talk. READ: Mark Meadows text messages regarding January 6 \u201cWe cannot be satisfied with incomplete answers or half truths,\u201d said Cheney, after reading from the text messages. \u201cAnd we cannot surrender to President Trump\u2019s efforts to hide what happened.\u201d The Wyoming lawmaker is one of just two Republicans serving on the panel. At the made-for-TV special hearing, convened during primetime, the committee voted to hold Meadows in contempt of Congress. The full House could weigh in on Tuesday, when members vote on whether to pursue contempt charges against someone many of them served with in Congress. Related: What is criminal contempt? The Justice Department could pursue a criminal case against Meadows, like it is against Steve Bannon, who was involved in a command center at the nearby Willard Hotel where Trump backers reportedly plotted the effort to overturn the election and prepped for the January 6 rally. Meadows, unlike Bannon, was at the White House with Trump, fielding messages from Fox personalities like Laura Ingraham and Brian Kilmeade and members of Congress who went unnamed by the committee Monday night. He could give the committee first-hand knowledge about why the then-President ignored his family and Sean Hannity, who asked, \u201cCan he make a statement? Ask people to leave the Capitol?\u201d, and let the riot carry on for hours. One of the unnamed lawmakers apologized the day after the Capitol riot for failing to stop the counting of electoral votes in key states Trump lost. \u201cWe tried everything we could in our objection to the six states,\u201d they told Meadows, according to a message read by Rep. Adam Schiff, a California Democrat on the committee. \u201cI am sorry nothing worked.\u201d Another lawmaker texted Meadows before January 6 insisting then-Vice President Mike Pence reject electoral votes, repeating back to the White House the proposal that was reportedly put forward in a much-discussed 38-page power point presentation that was seen as a recipe for a coup. \u201cOn January 6, 2021, Vice President Mike Pence, as President of the Senate, should call out all electoral votes that he believes are unconstitutional as no electoral votes at all,\u201d the lawmaker told Meadows, according to the committee. Meadows had reversed course in recent weeks and stopped cooperating with the committee, but not before handing over the text messages and communications committee members used against him Monday. He has also published a memoir that describes being with Trump at the White House during the riot down the street at the Capitol. Even if there are communications that would be protected by executive privilege, as Meadows contends, Schiff said these things he\u2019s already offered up to the committee or written about to sell his book can\u2019t be them. What\u2019s not clear is where things go next. The committee will seek to create a definitive record of the insurrection, including the original reaction of some Republicans who have tried to move and the Fox News hosts unmasked by their text messages. But while the hearing Monday was meant to make a public case, the Fox-viewing public is not likely to hear much about it. Democrats could lose control of the House next November, which means the committee has one year to complete its work. Meadows could well ride out the clock. Bannon\u2019s contempt of Congress trial, for example, is not happening until July. President Joe Biden has also shown an interest in trying to move on from the ills of the previous administration and build a legacy of new government programs rather than simply being the man protecting the country from Trump, who appears to be gearing up for a 2024 comeback. That\u2019s a messaging quandary the rest of Biden\u2019s party is grappling with heading into 2022. Democrats seem unable to figure out how to motivate voters around threats to democracy in elections that don\u2019t feature Trump\u2019s name on the ballot. \u201cWe have to be Paul Revere every chance we get to let people know what is at risk and why it is at risk. We live it. Every time we eat breakfast we think about these things. I don\u2019t think you can be overly concerned about this,\u201d Washington state Gov. Jay Inslee told CNN\u2019s Edward-Isaac Dovere at a gathering of the Democratic Governors Association over the weekend. But Inslee also seemed to acknowledged voters might not understand how close the US came to the end of its democracy were it not for Pence rejecting the effort. \u201cThe American psyche has not recognized we were one vice president away from a coup,\u201d he said.",

            "article_content": "Donald Trump Jr., Fox News personalities and lawmakers unsuccessfully implored then-White House chief of staff Mark Meadows on January 6 to get President Donald Trump to stop the violence unfurling at the US Capitol, according to text messages relayed by the House committee investigating the attack. The committee released the explosive new details Monday night as it met to advance a referral of Meadows to the Justice Department on a criminal contempt of Congress charge. The graphic messages illustrated the dismay of the former President\u2019s inner circle as the Capitol riot worsened, and they served as evidence of Trump\u2019s \u201csupreme dereliction of duty,\u201d the committee\u2019s vice chairwoman, Republican Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming, said Monday. Donald Trump Jr. said his father needed to 'condemn' Capitol violence as it unfolded, Meadows texts reveal Cheney made the motion for the committee to vote for the contempt resolution, which passed unanimously in the 9-member committee. The full House is expected to vote on the resolution on Tuesday. Those texts, as several members of the committee noted, were already turned over to the panel and are not covered by any claim of privilege \u2013 which Meadows has continued to assert since reversing his decision to cooperate with the investigation. Meadows did not address the text messages while discussing the committee\u2019s vote with Fox News\u2019 Sean Hannity later Monday. \u201cObviously, it\u2019s disappointing, but not surprising,\u201d Meadows said. At Monday night\u2019s meeting, the committee publicly released graphics that include texts sent to Meadows during the days around the insurrection. The committee pointed to texts exchanged between Meadows and lawmakers, Fox News personalities and other members of the media and Trump\u2019s eldest son about the urgency for the former President to act to stop the siege. Texts from unnamed lawmakers sent to Meadows said that former Vice President Mike Pence \u201cshould call out all electoral votes that he believes are unconstitutional as no electoral votes at all.\u201d Cheney said other texts \u2013 from members of Congress, members of the media and others \u2013 were sent in real time about the events as they unfolded. \u201cThese text messages leave no doubt. The White House knew exactly what was happening here at the Capitol,\u201d Cheney said. \u201cOne text Mr. Meadows received said quote \u2018We are under siege here at the Capitol.\u2019\u201d \u201cIn a third, \u2018Mark, protesters are literally storming the Capitol, breaking windows on doors, rushing in. Is Trump going to say something?\u2019 A fourth, \u2018There\u2019s an armed standoff at the House chamber door.\u2019 And another from someone inside the Capitol: \u2018We are all helpless.\u2019\u201d Cheney also read texts from news personalities from Fox News and Trump\u2019s own children. \u201cAs the violence continued, one of the President\u2019s sons texts Mr. Meadows, \u2018He\u2019s got to condemn this ASAP. The capitol police tweet is not enough,\u2019 Donald Trump Jr. texted. Meadows responded, \u2018I am pushing it hard. I agree.\u2019\u201d Cheney continued: \u201cDonald Trump Jr. texted again and again, urging action by the President. Quote, \u2018We need an Oval Office address. He has to lead now. It has gone too far. And gotten out of hand,\u2019 end quote. But hours passed without necessary action by the President,\u201d Cheney said. When the events of the certification of the Electoral College eventually happened in the early hours of January 7, Meadows received a text calling January 6 a \u201cterrible day.\u201d \u201cYesterday was a terrible day. We tried everything we could in our objections to the 6 states,\u201d the text read. \u201cI\u2019m sorry nothing worked.\u201d Committee Chairman Bennie Thompson, a Mississippi Democrat, took the opportunity on Monday to highlight the committee\u2019s progress and paint Meadows, as well as a handful of other Trump allies who continue to defy the panel, as outliers. Newly revealed text messages to Meadows undercut GOP whitewashing of the insurrection \u201cThis week, I expect that roughly a dozen key witnesses will provide testimony on the record in our investigation. We\u2019ll hear from many more informally as we continue to gather facts about the violence of January 6th and its causes,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cThat should put us well north of the 300 mark in terms of witnesses who have given us information. Add to that more than 30,000 records, and nearly 250 substantive tips on our tip line.\u201d The committee informed Meadows last week that it had \u201cno choice\u201d but to advance criminal contempt proceedings against him given that he had decided to no longer cooperate with its investigation. \u201cMr. Meadows started by doing the right thing \u2013 cooperating. He handed over records that he didn\u2019t try to shield behind some excuse,\u201d Thompson said on Monday. \u201cBut in an investigation like ours, that\u2019s just a first step. When the records raise questions \u2013 as these most certainly do \u2013 you have to come in and answer those questions. And when it was time for him to follow the law, come in, and testify on those questions, he changed his mind and told us to pound sand. He didn\u2019t even show up.\u201d On Sunday, the committee released its contempt report, which made public several details about Meadows\u2019 actions before and during January 6, as well as his role in attempting to overturn the 2020 election. The committee noted that in one email Meadows sent to an individual about January 6, he said that \u201cthe National Guard would be present to \u2018protect pro Trump people\u2019 and that many more would be available on standby.\u201d Additionally, the committee said in the report that Meadows \u201cexchanged text messages with, and provided guidance to, an organizer of the January 6th rally on the Ellipse after the organizer told him that \u2018[t]hings have gotten crazy and I desperately need some direction.\u2019\u201d New details shed light on ways Mark Meadows pushed federal agencies to pursue dubious election claims The new documents came as Meadows\u2019 role was under renewed scrutiny following his decision to cease cooperating with the committee last week. The committee has previously sought communications between Meadows and certain rally organizers as the panel remains focused on identifying any level of coordination with the Trump White House. The report went on to note that Meadows was directly involved in efforts to overturn the election results in key swing states Trump lost and helped push unfounded claims about voter fraud. Before the Monday vote, Meadows\u2019 lawyer had asked the panel to reconsider its plans. In a letter to the committee, Meadows\u2019 attorney George Terwilliger III said the \u201ccontemplated referral would be contrary to law\u201d because his client is a senior official who made a \u201cgood-faith invocation of executive privilege and testimonial immunity.\u201d \u201cA referral of a senior presidential aide would also be unwise because it would do great damage to the institution of the Presidency, as restraint in the application of the statute over time attests,\u201d Terwilliger wrote. Terwilliger said that Meadows\u2019 choice to decline a deposition is an attempt to comply with his \u201clegal obligations\u201d as a former Trump adviser. \u201cHistory and the law teach that this attempt is not a crime,\u201d Terwilliger wrote. Terwilliger also suggested the committee should allow the civil lawsuit Meadows filed against the panel to play out before moving to contempt \u2013 because a ruling in that case would resolve the questions surrounding privilege that are in dispute.

            "article_content": "Former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows sent an email saying the National Guard would be present to \u2018protect pro Trump people\u2019 in the lead up to the US Capitol insurrection, according to a new report released by the January 6 committee Sunday night. It was just one of several new details in the report about Meadows\u2019 actions before and during January 6, as well as his role in attempting to overturn the 2020 election. The report is a key component for the committee to send a referral for charges of criminal contempt of Congress to the Justice Department. The panel informed Meadows last week that it had \u201cno choice\u201d but to advance criminal contempt proceedings against him given that he had decided to no longer cooperate with their investigation. The panel will meet Monday to formally advance the report to the full floor House vote as soon as later this week. The vote by the full House is the last step before sending the referral to the DOJ.

The new documents come as Meadows\u2019 role is under renewed scrutiny following his decision to cease cooperating with the committee last week. Committee chairman Bennie Thompson appeared to allude to this January 5 email about having the National Guard on standby in a letter to Meadows\u2019 attorney last week informing him that the panel would move forward with contempt proceedings. Thompson also referred to a November 7, 2020, email discussing the appointment of alternate slates of electors as part of a \u201cdirect and collateral attack\u201d and a January 5 email that had a 38-page PowerPoint briefing titled \u201cElection Fraud, Foreign Interference & Options for 6 JAN\u201d to be provided \u201con the hill.\u201d Meadows, according to the report, \u201creceived text messages and emails regarding apparent efforts to encourage Republican legislators in certain States to send alternate slates of electors to Congress, a plan which one Member of Congress acknowledged was \u2018highly controversial\u2019 and to which Mr. Meadows responded, \u2018I love it.\u2019\u201d \u201cMr. Meadows responded to a similar message by saying \u2018[w]e are\u2019 and another such message by saying \u2018Yes. Have a team on it,\u2019\u201d the report said. Additionally, the committee notes that Meadows \u201cexchanged text messages with, and provided guidance to, an organizer of the January 6th rally on the Ellipse after the organizer told him that \u2018[t]hings have gotten crazy and I desperately need some direction.\u2019\u201d If Meadows was still cooperating, the committee also said it would inquire about a text exchange with a media personality \u201cwho had encouraged the presidential statement asking people to, quote, \u2018peacefully leave the Capitol,\u2019\u201d as well as a text sent \u201cto one of\u2014 by one of the President\u2019s family members indicating that Mr. Meadows is, quote, \u2018pushing hard,\u2019 end quote, for a statement from President Trump to, quote, \u2018condemn this shit,\u2019 end quote, happening at the Capitol.\u201d The committee has previously sought communications between Meadows and certain rally organizers as the panel remains focused on identifying any level of coordination with the Trump White House. The report goes on to note that Meadows was directly involved in efforts to overturn the election results in key swing states Trump lost and helped push unfounded claims about voter fraud. \u201cMr. Meadows participated in meetings and calls during which the participants reportedly discussed the need to \u201dfight\u201d back against \u201dmounting evidence\u201d of purported voter fraud after courts had considered and overwhelmingly rejected Trump campaign claims of voter fraud and other election irregularities,\u201d it says. \u201cHe participated in one such meeting in the Oval Office with Mr. Trump and Members of Congress, which he publicly tweeted about from his personal Twitter account shortly after. He participated in another such call just days before the January 6 attack with Mr. Trump, Members of Congress, attorneys for the Trump re-election campaign, and \u2018some 300\u2019 State and local officials to discuss the goal of overturning certain States\u2019 electoral college results on January 6, 2021,\u201d the report adds. In response to the panel\u2019s push for criminal contempt proceedings, Meadows filed a lawsuit against House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and select committee members, asking a federal court to block enforcement of the subpoena the committee issued him as well as the subpoena it issued to Verizon for his phone records. Meadows alleges that the subpoenas are \u201coverly broad and unduly burdensome,\u201d while claiming that the committee \u201clacks lawful authority to seek and to obtain\u201d the information requested. Still, prior to Meadows\u2019 decision to halt cooperation with the committee, he had turned over approximately 6,000 pages worth of documents. That includes information from his personal email account and personal cell phone that are relevant to the committee\u2019s investigation.

            "article_content": "A lawyer for Mark Meadows says the former Trump White House chief of staff was the recipient of a PowerPoint document detailing ways to undermine the count of the 2020 election but did nothing with it, according to the New York Times. The 38-page document, which is among thousands of pages of materials Meadows provided to the House committee investigating the January 6 insurrection at the US Capitol, was initially circulated by a retired Army colonel who was working to challenge the results, according to the Times. CNN has not independently verified the contents of the PowerPoint. Phil Waldron, a retired colonel who spread misinformation about election fraud in the presidential election, told the Times that he circulated the PowerPoint among allies of former President Donald Trump, including lawmakers on Capitol Hill. Waldron told the Times that he did not directly send the document to Meadows, but that it was possible someone on his team had passed it along to the former chief of staff. Timeline of the coup: How Trump tried to weaponize the Justice Department to overturn the 2020 election Separately, Waldron told The Washington Post that he spoke with Meadows \u201cmaybe eight to 10 times\u201d and visited the White House on multiple occasions after the 2020 election. CNN has previously reported that in the committee\u2019s letter to Meadows\u2019 attorney George Terwilliger III announcing its decision to pursue criminal contempt proceedings against Meadows for ceasing to cooperate with the panel, it wrote that committee members were in possession of \u201ca Jan 5 2021 email regarding a 38 page Power Point briefing titled \u2018Election Fraud, Foreign Interference, & Options for 6 JAN\u2019 that was to be provided \u2018on the hill.\u201d The committee has not publicly released that document and has not offered any specifics as to what the document contained. Terwilliger told the New York Times that Meadows provided the document to the committee because he received it in an email and did nothing with it. \u201cWe produced the document because it wasn\u2019t privileged,\u201d Terwilliger told the Times. CNN has reached out to Terwilliger for comment. Waldron told the Times that Meadows \u201cwould have gotten a copy for situational awareness for what was being briefed on the Hill at the time.\u201d Waldron told the newspaper that members of his team spoke with a group of senators on January 4 and that he personally briefed a small group of House members the following day about the contents of the PowerPoint. He added that the PowerPoint was made available to the lawmakers. CNN has reached out to Waldron for comment. The fact that Meadows received and was in possession of the PowerPoint with this title is noteworthy, regardless of the document\u2019s contents and what he did with it. Meadows played a central role in the peddling of election lies and attempted to use the power of the executive branch to intervene and interrupt the peaceful transfer of power, CNN has previously reported. A separate, 36-page PowerPoint has been circulating on Twitter, but CNN has not confirmed the veracity of this document, and the committee tells CNN it is different than the document members have in their possession. The PowerPoint is part of nearly 6,000 pages worth of documents Meadows voluntarily turned over to the committee prior to his decision to stop cooperating with the panel. Among those pages, a source told CNN, Meadows supplied the committee with significant information from both his personal email account and personal cell phone that are relevant to the committee\u2019s investigation. In addition to the PowerPoint, Meadows turned over a significant number of text messages, including one November 6, 2020, text exchange with a member of Congress, where Meadows reportedly said \u201cI love it\u201d in a discussion about the possibility of appointing alternate electors in certain states, and the member acknowledged the plan would be \u201chighly controversial.\u201d January 6 committee subpoenas Trump-backed congressional candidate The committee also has in its possession a text exchange between Meadows and an organizer of the January 6 rally from early January 2021, and text messages about the need for Trump to issue some kind of a public statement to stop the January 6 attack at the Capitol. CNN also previously reported that in the tranche of documents Meadows provided to the committee, he was interacting \u201cwith a wide range of individuals while the attack was underway,\u201d according to a source with knowledge of the communications. The messages on Meadows\u2019 personal cell phone and email account, which were voluntarily handed over without any claim of executive privilege, relate to \u201cwhat Donald Trump was doing and not doing during the riot,\u201d the source added. These communications offer a window into what people were texting to Meadows on January 6, what he was telling them about Trump in real time, and what the former President was doing for those hours while the Capitol was under attack and rioters were chanting \u201cHang Mike Pence,\u201d according to the source. According to multiple sources, including former Trump officials and others with direct knowledge of what was happening behind the scenes at the White House, Meadows also reached out to some of the country\u2019s top national security officials in an effort to connect them to Trump allies who were pushing unfounded claims of foreign election interference and voter fraud. Not only did Meadows try to get top government officials to investigate baseless conspiracy theories being espoused by the likes of Rudy Giuliani, Mike Flynn and Sidney Powell, he also passed along conspiratorial materials himself, including YouTube videos and other information that alleged widespread evidence of voter fraud, sources say. Despite the sheer volume of documents Meadows has turned over to the committee, he recently made a complete reversal and decided to stop cooperating and not show up for a scheduled deposition. The committee therefore has begun criminal contempt proceedings against Meadows, which the House is slated to vote on Tuesday. If the criminal contempt report passes the House, it will be referred to the Department of Justice, which will have to decide whether or not to prosecute.",

            "article_content": "Former President Donald Trump\u2019s efforts to block the release of potentially damning White House records hit a new snag in court \u2013 but his promise to appeal all but guarantees the final call will land with the Supreme Court. The ruling by a federal appeals court on Thursday set up a potential review by the high court that, pending a promised challenge from the former President, will decide whether the long sought-after records make their way to the same institution that pro-Trump rioters stormed in a failed effort to thwart the certification of President Joe Biden\u2019s election victory earlier this year. The lower court\u2019s action, along with some flexing by the committee earlier in the day when it marched in a series of witnesses for interviews, signaled an escalation of the House investigation on the same day it was revealed that Trump could be compelled to testify in a New York state probe into his namesake company. In its 68-page, unanimous opinion, the federal court not only paved the way for House investigators to obtain crucial evidence but offered a striking explanation of why it came to its conclusion. After rolling their eyes at Trump\u2019s argument for keeping the material secret, the judges wrote that \u201cthere is a sufficient factual predicate for inferring that former President Trump and his advisers played a materially relevant role\u201d in what they described as \u201ca singular event in this nation\u2019s history.\u201d 5 people who are stonewalling the House January 6 committee Responding to the court\u2019s opinion, Trump spokeswoman Liz Harrington did not address the specifics of the decision, but looked ahead to a battle she said was \u201calways destined for the Supreme Court.\u201d Trump, given his expectations of loyalty, surely views the court\u2019s conservative supermajority \u2013 including three justices he appointed \u2013 as a more welcoming forum, especially with the high-stakes release of his presidential records in the balance. A decision in his favor would not only be a rebuke to investigators, but the current administration, which has rejected its predecessor\u2019s efforts to put a lid on his records and communications, refusing to assert the executive privilege that Trump is trying to confer upon himself. The House committee, too, has become increasingly aggressive in its pursuit of depositions from individuals they think may be connected to the January 6 attack on the US Capitol. Committe Chairman Bennie Thompson, a Mississippi Democrat, told CNN late Thursday that the process is now in place for a full House vote \u2013 expected for Tuesday \u2013 to hold Trump\u2019s former chief of staff, Mark Meadows, in contempt over his eleventh hour refusal to sit down for an interview. But even as he now plays hard-to-get, Meadows, who angered Trump with the publication of a memoir about his time in the former President\u2019s service, might have already provided the committee with damaging information in the form of more than 6,000 documents in connection with the events of January 6. Included in that tranche, a source told CNN, were messages from Meadows\u2019 personal cell phone and email account that relate to \u201cwhat Donald Trump was doing and not doing during the riot.\u201d The documents also made clear, the source said, that Meadows himself was \u201cexchanging (communications) with a wide range of individuals while the attack was underway.\u201d January 6 committee gets Meadows texts, emails with 'wide range' of people while attack was underway Meadows, in a move that mirrors a famous habit of his old boss, has filed a lawsuit against House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and members of the committee in response to its plans to move forward with criminal contempt proceedings against him. Republican Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming, the committee\u2019s vice chair, sounded unimpressed when responding to word of the former North Carolina congressman\u2019s legal maneuver, telling CNN, \u201cWe look forward to litigating that\u201d \u2013 and making a point of the absurdity underlying Meadows\u2019 refusal to answer questions about documents that he voluntarily handed over. Cheney, one of only two Republicans serving on the committee, warned against underestimating the investigation in a series of tweets Thursday afternoon. The committee, she said, had met with \u201cnearly 300 witnesses\u201d and touted \u201cfour more key figures\u201d whose appearances had been overshadowed by Meadows\u2019 refusal and a skepticism in Washington about the committee\u2019s ability to overcome substantial legal hurdles before Republicans, should they win a House majority next year, summarily disband it. \u201cThe investigation is firing on all cylinders,\u201d Cheney said. \u201cDo not be misled: President Trump is trying to hide what happened on January 6th and to delay and obstruct. We will not let that happen. The truth will come out.\u201d The action on Capitol Hill was accompanied on Thursday by the revelation that, up in Trump\u2019s old home state of New York, state Attorney General Letitia James is now seeking to depose him as part of her office\u2019s civil fraud investigation into the Trump Organization, according to a source familiar with the matter. James, whose investigation of former New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo\u2019s alleged sexual misconduct ultimately led to his resignation, has requested that the former President sit down for an interview with prosecutors by January 7. James is looking into whether Trump\u2019s business, which is based in New York, manipulated the value of its properties. (She is also working on a parallel criminal probe alongside Manhattan District Attorney Cy Vance focused on other potential crimes committed by the Trump Organization.) A spokesperson for the Trump Organization offered a typically florid response to the news, which was first reported by The Washington Post, calling Trump the target of a \u201cpolitical witch hunt.\u201d New York attorney general subpoenas Trump for testimony in civil fraud investigation \u201cNew York is being overrun by violence, children are being shot in Times Square, arsonists are setting Christmas decorations ablaze and homelessness is through the roof, yet the only focus of the New York AG is to investigate Trump, all for her own political ambitions as she attempts to run for Governor,\u201d the spokesperson said \u2013 at around the same time James announced that she had dropped out of the Democratic gubernatorial primary and would seek reelection to her current post. Back in Washington, January 6 committee members have been cautious in their public statements and media interviews about speculating over what their work might yield. But any clear determination is still a ways off. Asked if she was concerned that the high court\u2019s ideological makeup could lead to a reversal of the appeals court\u2019s Thursday opinion, Virginia Rep. Elaine Luria, a committee member from Virginia, expressed confidence the ruling would be upheld. \u201cI think what we would be likely to see from the Supreme Court is that all of the judicial rulings leading up to this point have substantiated the documents are necessary and that President Trump \u2013 he is the former President,\u201d Luria told CNN. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t have a right to executive privilege over these documents.\u201d As the appeals court prepared to drop its bombshell, witnesses cycled in and out of meetings with the committee on Thursday. Among them were conservative lawyer John Eastman, who in the run-up to January 6 pushed a dubious legal theory that then-Vice President Mike Pence had the constitutional authority to halt or impede the certification process. The suggestion itself was always bunk, but Trump latched on to it and excoriated Pence at the time for his resistance. By the time the mob had breached the Capitol, demonstrators outside had rolled out a makeshift gallows and chanted, \u201cHang Mike Pence!\u201d Eastman appeared in person for his scheduled deposition, a source familiar with the meeting said, though it remains unclear whether he answered the committee\u2019s questions or pleaded the Fifth, as he\u2019d previously indicated he would, during their sitdown. Two others, though, told reporters that they cooperated. Kash Patel, the former chief of staff to then-acting Secretary of Defense Christopher Miller, met with the committee, a source familiar with the matter told CNN. Patel\u2019s appearance capped off a lengthy back-and-forth over when he would come in to testify. A former top aide to the Republican California Rep. Devin Nunes, a Trump loyalist, Patel said in a statement after his interview that he had answered the questions posed to him \u201cto the best of my ability.\u201d January 6 committee projects confidence. What does it know? Whether and to what extent he divulged meaningful information remains to be seen. But CNN has previously reported that the committee told Patel \u201cthere is substantial reason to believe\u201d he could provide important insight into how the Department of Defense, by then dominated by a small and unwieldy group of Trump allies, and the White House prepared for and responded to the attack on the Capitol \u2013 a matter they believe might be further illuminated by more details about Patel\u2019s communications with Meadows. Committee members also met with \u201cStop the Steal\u201d rally organizer Ali Alexander, a right-wing activist whose tweets about the election got him banned from the platform. Alexander told reporters he planned to cooperate and that he had no role in the violence that followed the rally, which had been permitted on the North East side of the Capitol grounds. It was there, of course, that Trump infamously whipped up the angry crowd and put a target on his vice president. \u201cMike Pence is going to have to come through for us, and if he doesn\u2019t, that will be a, a sad day for our country because you\u2019re sworn to uphold our Constitution,\u201d Trump said. \u201cNow, it is up to Congress to confront this egregious assault on our democracy. And after this, we\u2019re going to walk down, and I\u2019ll be there with you, we\u2019re going to walk down, we\u2019re going to walk down.\u201d Trump did not, in fact, walk anywhere. He returned home after his remarks and his actions from the White House are now under strict scrutiny. Alexander\u2019s behavior is of particular interest because he previously claimed \u2013 during remarks on Periscope in December 2020 \u2013 to have been in contact with a trio of right-wing House members, Reps. Paul Gosar of Arizona, Mo Brooks of Alabama and Andy Biggs of Arizona. Alexander has since denied working with any lawmaker in connection with the insurrection that followed his rally. \u201cWe\u2019ve provided the committee with thousands of records, hundreds of pages. And you know, unfortunately, I think that this committee has gone way too much into our personal life, way too much into my First Amendment,\u201d Alexander said on Thursday before his interview. \u201cBut I do recognize they have a legislative duty to conduct it, so we\u2019re here to cooperate.\u201d",

While Trump true-believers like former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows are loudly not cooperating with the House committee investigating the January 6 insurrection, a flurry of activity behind the scenes suggests progress for the inquiry. Rep. Liz Cheney, one of two Republicans on the committee, projected confidence and forward momentum in a Twitter thread Thursday. What does the committee have? The House committee has met with nearly 300 witnesses, including four Thursday, she tweeted. It has \u201creceived exceptionally interesting and important documents,\u201d she wrote, including text messages from Meadows\u2019 private cellphone. \u201cDo not be misled: President Trump is trying to hide what happened on January 6th and to delay and obstruct. We will not let that happen,\u201d she promised. What is the committee getting? Separately, an appeals court on Thursday ruled against the former President\u2019s claim of executive privilege over documents related to the insurrection. The ruling is paused for two weeks, which allows Trump to ask the Supreme Court to weigh in. Cheney may see the endgame, but it has been a confusing time to follow news about Meadows in particular. Meadows\u2019 quick change. First he was cooperating with the House January 6 committee. Then he wasn\u2019t, skipping a deposition and inviting a contempt of Congress charge. Now he\u2019s suing House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and committee members. The ups and downs have kept his name in headlines. It\u2019s almost like this guy is trying to sell a book. Wait. He is selling a book! His memoir went on sale this week. One can imagine it would be bad for sales if the man whose book jacket is an image of him standing in the background behind Trump was to be seen as defying the former President. Revelations from Meadow\u2019s memoir. The book is called \u201cThe Chief\u2019s Chief,\u201d and it includes the tidbit  about Trump\u2019s hidden positive test for Covid-19 and the worse-than-reported state of Trump\u2019s health during his bout of the coronavirus. The committee may have to go after Meadows in court to get him to appear in person, but with his text messages and emails from January 6, they may not need to. The communications were voluntarily handed over to the committee and, according to CNN\u2019s report, \u201coffer a window into what people were texting to Meadows on January 6, what he was telling them about Trump in real time, and what the former President was doing for those hours while the Capitol was under attack and rioters were chanting \u2018Hang Mike Pence.\u2019\u201d Who testified Thursday? Kash Patel, a former chief of staff to then-acting Secretary of Defense Christopher Miler, was spotted on Capitol Hill by CNN reporters. He\u2019s also a former aide to Republican Rep. Devin Nunes of California, who this week announced he\u2019ll be resigning at the end of the year to run Trump\u2019s new media venture. From CNN\u2019s report: CNN previously reported that the committee told Patel \u201cthere is substantial reason to believe\u201d that he has important insight and information into how the Department of Defense and White House prepared for and responded to the attack at the US Capitol. The committee also said it wants to learn more about the direct communication Patel had with former Trump White House chief of staff Mark Meadows on the day of the insurrection. \u201cStop the Steal\u201d rally organizer Ali Alexander, whose group had a permit to be on Capitol grounds on January 6, also testified Thursday. Alexander said he was not part of the violence and denied working with Republican congressmen to attack the Capitol \u2013 even though he previously outlined his close contact with lawmakers about the rally that preceded the insurrection. Chris Krebs, the former director of the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency in the Department of Homeland Security who has rejected Trump\u2019s election fantasy, also appeared before the committee. Who else is cooperating? CNN reported earlier this week that Marc Short, former chief of staff to Vice President Pence, was issued a subpoena by the committee some weeks ago and that he is cooperating. What did Short go through on January 6? He spoke to CNN\u2019s David Axelrod on \u201cThe Axe Files\u201d podcast about his firsthand experience. Maybe it\u2019s a good idea to separate people into two batches: the public stonewallers and the private testifiers. CNN\u2019s Zachary Cohen goes into detail on each of the five known people who are stonewalling \u2013 either defying the committee or planning to plead the Fifth Amendment and seek protection against self-incrimination. RELATED: Here\u2019s what pleading the Fifth is and what it means for the January 6th Committee You\u2019ve probably heard of all of the stonewallers: As the committee quietly works toward accountability, the rest of the political world is, for now, carrying on with life. And elections are approaching. A primary in Georgia. As the House committee looks at whether Trump and officials in his administration tried to overturn election results in Georgia, a Trump ally and former senator, David Perdue, announced a primary challenge to the state\u2019s sitting Republican Gov. Brian Kemp. Perdue says he wouldn\u2019t have signed off on the 2020 election results. CNN\u2019s Chris Cillizza writes that election rejection is now a must for aspiring Republican candidates. Pence in New Hampshire. While his former staffers were in Washington cooperating with the January 6 committee, CNN\u2019s Randi Kaye literally ran into Pence in New Hampshire. New Hampshire! It traditionally holds the first-in-the-nation primary. Pence wouldn\u2019t say if he\u2019ll be running for President in 2024. But it\u2019s early. Will Trump run again? CNN\u2019s Gabby Orr writes that Trump\u2019s lack of commitment on whether he\u2019ll run has frozen the GOP field in place. Asked by conservative talk radio host Hugh Hewitt if he might not run, Trump said, \u201cIf I do decide that, I think my base is going to be very angry.\u201d So it at least sounds like he\u2019s running in the next presidential election. Which makes the inquiry into the effort to overturn the last election all the more important.",

            "article_content": "A growing number of key allies of former President Donald Trump are refusing to cooperate with the House select committee investigating the January 6 Capitol riot, using various tactics to skirt the panel\u2019s subpoenas and stonewall the sweeping probe. Members of the committee are convinced there are still plenty of ways to gain access to information that is crucial to their investigation even if some potentially key witnesses continue to resist compliance. Here's what pleading the Fifth is and what it means for the January 6 committee But the defiance of this handful of Trump allies does pose a challenge for the panel. Many of these individuals, including former administration officials, could provide critical information relevant to the probe and some are suspected of being key players in a broader plot to overturn the 2020 election. With a limited amount of time to complete its investigation, the clock is becoming the committee\u2019s worst enemy and those who are refusing to cooperate appear to know it. Here are some of the most notable individuals currently refusing to cooperate: The committee wants to ask Bannon about his conversations with the former President leading up to the Capitol riot and involvement in the so-called war room of Trump allies at the Willard hotel in Washington in early January. Members of the panel have noted that Bannon made comments on his podcast the day before rioters stormed the Capitol predicting that \u201call hell\u201d was \u201cgoing to break loose\u201d on January 6 \u2013 leading the committee to suspect he may have had advance knowledge of what was to come. Steve Bannon's contempt of Congress trial set for July 18 Of all the individuals subpoenaed by the committee so far, Bannon has been the most brazen in his defiance. Bannon refused to turn over documents to the committee and appear for a deposition, which earned him a criminal referral for contempt of Congress. He was subsequently indicted by the Department of Justice last month and is now awaiting trial, which is set to begin on July 18. The ex-adviser to Trump has pleaded not guilty to the contempt charges but vowed to make his case \u201cthe misdemeanor from hell for Merrick Garland, Nancy Pelosi and Joe Biden.\u201d In the meantime, Bannon has continued to use his podcast to whitewash the violence on January 6. While Bannon was never expected to cooperate with the House investigation, his criminal trial may serve as a test of the committee\u2019s ability to enforce subpoenas and counter claims of executive privilege made by other witnesses who have resisted cooperation. As Trump\u2019s former White House chief of staff, Mark Meadows has unique knowledge about what the former President was doing and saying behind closed doors on and around January 6. There is also a growing body of evidence indicating Meadows played a direct role in efforts to overturn the 2020 election. CNN previously reported he tried to enlist government officials to pursue baseless election conspiracy theories and pressured state officials to help overturn vote tallies in states Trump lost. January 6 committee gets Meadows texts, emails with 'wide range' of people while attack was underway Meadows repeatedly claimed that his direct conversations with Trump should be shielded by executive privilege. But committee members have said that many of their questions have nothing to do with his discussions with the former President and wouldn\u2019t be subject to an executive privilege argument. Democratic Rep. Pete Aguilar of California, a member of the committee, previously told CNN that Meadows\u2019 \u201cconversations about stopping a free and fair election, about criticizing and stopping the counting of electoral votes, about his coordination with campaign officials on private devices that were not turned over, all of those issues are not privilege worthy and he has some explaining to do.\u201d The House select committee informed Meadows this week that its has \u201cno choice\u201d but to advance criminal contempt proceedings against him given that he has decided to no longer cooperate with the panel, according to a new letter. At the heart of the fallout between Meadows and the committee is a disagreement over what is covered by executive privilege. Prior to Meadows\u2019 decision to halt cooperation with the committee, he had turned over approximately 6,000 pages worth of documents to the panel, including significant information from both his personal email account and personal cell phone that are relevant to the sweeping investigation. As a sympathizer to election fraud conspiracy theories, former Justice Department official Jeffrey Clark became Trump\u2019s most useful asset inside the agency in the days before January 6 and the committee believes he was central to efforts to overturn Joe Biden\u2019s electoral victory in key swing states. Clark helped the former President devise a plan to oust the then-acting attorney general, place himself atop the department and have the DOJ intervene in Georgia to set aside its voting results in order to sway the state toward Trump. January 6 committee moves to hold former DOJ official in contempt but also gives him one last chance to cooperate When Clark\u2019s superiors learned of his scheming with Trump in early January, they threatened to resign en masse. The committee has moved to hold Clark in contempt of Congress for defying his subpoena but is also giving him another opportunity to comply with the order by appearing for a second deposition and claiming Fifth Amendment protection on a question-by-question basis should he choose. Unlike Bannon, Clark did appear for an initial interview with the committee but refused to answer questions, citing vague claims of executive and attorney-client privilege. He then changed his legal argument and told the committee he plans to invoke the Fifth Amendment after the panel rejected those privilege claims outright. If Clark answers the committee\u2019s questions by pleading the Fifth Amendment, the panel will likely have to stop the process of holding him in criminal contempt. If Clark continues to stonewall the committee and invoke the Fifth Amendment in ways the committee deems illegitimate, the panel will proceed with a floor vote. The committee\u2019s interest in conservative lawyer John Eastman centers around him helping craft a questionable legal theory that former Vice President Mike Pence had the constitutional authority to interrupt the certification of the 2020 presidential election results. Eastman has informed the January 6 congressional committee that he plans to defy a subpoena from the panel, according to a letter obtained by CNN. Rep. Jamie Raskin, a Democrat from Maryland and member of the committee, previously told CNN the panel wants to know more about Eastman\u2019s role in attempting to overturn the election results. Conservative lawyer Eastman says he will defy subpoena from January 6 committee \u201cWe need to determine to what extent there was an organized effort against Vice President Pence and we believe that, you know, some of the actors\u2019 names have become known, including John Eastman, who laid it out in a memo,\u201d Raskin said last month. In a letter earlier this month, Eastman\u2019s attorney told committee Chair Rep. Bennie Thompson that answering the panel\u2019s questions could put Eastman at legal risk. \u201cWhile Dr. Eastman emphatically denies committing any illegal acts, he nonetheless has a reasonable fear that the requested information could be used against him in court,\u201d he wrote. Roger Stone not only promoted his appearance at a January 6 \u201cStop the Steal\u201d event but solicited donations for it and stated his purpose at the rally was to \u201clead a march to the Capitol,\u201d according to the panel\u2019s subpoena letter to him. The committee added that, according to media reports, Stone used members of the Oath Keepers as personal security guards, several of whom stormed the Capitol and at least one who has been indicted, while he was in Washington. Roger Stone becomes the latest to say he'd plead the Fifth to January 6 committee Stone has also said he intends to plead the Fifth Amendment as a way to try and get out of cooperating with the panel. Stone was scheduled for a deposition on December 17, but his lawyer told the committee this week he is now declining to produce documents or be deposed \u201cpursuant the Fifth Amendment.\u201d Following the last major House inquiry into election integrity, after the 2016 election, Stone was convicted in federal court of obstructing Congress by lying about his efforts to contact WikiLeaks on behalf of the Trump campaign. At his criminal trial, which occurred before the end of the Trump administration, the Justice Department successfully argued Stone lied to Congress to protect Trump. Trump later pardoned him.",

            "article_content": "Former Trump White House chief of staff Mark Meadows is suing the House select committee investigating January 6 and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, asking a federal court to block enforcement of the subpoena the committee issued him as well as the subpoena it issued to Verizon for his phone records, according to the complaint filed Wednesday. The lawsuit comes after the committee signaled it would pursue a criminal contempt referral against Meadows because of his refusal to sit for a deposition in the investigation into the Capitol riot. Meadows alleges that the subpoenas are \u201coverly broad and unduly burdensome,\u201d while claiming that the committee \u201clacks lawful authority to seek and to obtain\u201d the information requested. Republican Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming, who serves as vice chair of the panel, told CNN Wednesday evening, \u201cWe look forward to litigating that.\u201d Cheney noted that Meadows is refusing to answer questions about documents that he turned over voluntarily. New details shed light on ways Mark Meadows pushed federal agencies to pursue dubious election claims \u201cThe committee has received a number of extremely interesting, non-privileged documents from Mr. Meadows. These include text messages and emails from his private cell phone and private email account. He\u2019s produced these documents, they are not privileged,\u201d she said. \u201cThey include documents that are directly related to what President Trump should have been doing on January 6 during the attack, and now he is refusing to appear to answer questions about those non-privileged documents.\u201d The lawsuit points to President Joe Biden\u2019s refusal to assert executive privilege, which former President Donald Trump has sought, in the investigation \u2013 a dispute currently being litigated in a separate case Trump has brought seeking to block the release of his White House records to House investigators. \u201cAs a result, Mr. Meadows, a witness, has been put in the untenable position of choosing between conflicting privilege claims that are of constitutional origin and dimension and having to either risk enforcement of the subpoena issued to him, not merely by the House of Representatives, but through actions by the Executive and Judicial Branches, or, alternatively, unilaterally abandoning the former president\u2019s claims of privileges and immunities,\u201d Meadows\u2019 lawsuit said. RELATED: New details shed light on ways Mark Meadows pushed federal agencies to pursue dubious election claims The lawsuit additionally alleges that the Verizon subpoena violates both the Constitution and the Stored Communications Act. Select Committee Chairman Bennie Thompson said he plans to move ahead next week with a criminal contempt referral. \u201cI\u2019m not a lawyer or judge and we\u2019ll see what happens,\u201d said the Mississippi Democrat, who added he had not reviewed the suit in great detail. \u201cBut we have every intention to move forward with the contempt citation.\u201d Thompson rejected claims in the lawsuit that the committee was without merit and therefore had no right to access the personal information of its subpoena targets. \u201cWell, you know, in this town, every lawyer has at least one opinion,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cWe have authority because we were created by the House of Representatives.\u201d Takeaways from the appeals court hearing in the January 6 Trump documents case When asked if he thought the lawsuit was a stall tactic by Meadows and his legal team, Thompson replied flatly: \u201cYes.\u201d Rep. Adam Schiff, a California Democrat who is a member of the committee and one of the defendants named in the lawsuit, said the suit \u201ccertainly strikes me as another fruitless effort to impede the work of the committee.\u201d The committee\u2019s Meadows subpoena sought 27 categories of records, according to the complaint \u2013 most of them having to do with the effort by Trump and his allies to overturn the election results as well as communications specific to the events of January 6. The subpoena additionally demanded that Meadows sit for a deposition. While Meadows did produce some of the requested documents, he and the committee entered a standoff over the deposition, with Meadows claiming in the lawsuit that the committee refused to negotiate with him in good faith to accommodate his concerns around executive privilege and testimonial immunity. Meadows ultimately reached an agreement with the committee to appear voluntarily for a deposition Wednesday, his lawsuit said, but then he was \u201cblindsided\u201d last week by a notification from Verizon that it had been subpoenaed for metadata from the personal cell phone he used while White House chief of staff. Prior to Meadows\u2019 recent decision to halt cooperation with the committee, he had turned over approximately 6,000 pages worth of documents. That includes information from his personal email account and personal cell phone that are relevant to the committee\u2019s investigation. Meadows plays both sides of January 6 probe while clock ticks on investigation In one November 6, 2020, text exchange with a member of Congress, Meadows reportedly said \u201cI love it\u201d in a discussion about the possibility of appointing alternate electors in certain states, and the member acknowledged the plan would be \u201chighly controversial.\u201d The committee also has in its possession a text exchange between Meadows and an organizer of the January 6 rally that preceded the riot from early January 2021, and text messages about the need for Trump to issue some kind of a public statement to stop the January 6 attack on the Capitol. Meadows has not indicated he will claim 5th Amendment protections, but multiple witnesses subpoenaed by the committee, including Trump ally Roger Stone and former Justice Department official Jeffrey Clark, have said they intend to do so. This story has been updated with additional developments Wednesday.",

            "article_content": "The New York City Council on Thursday is set to approve a measure that will allow for noncitizens who are legal residents to vote in local elections. Under the bill, individuals who have lived in the city for at least 30 days and are legal permanent residents in the US \u2013 including green card holders, individuals with workers permits and DACA holders \u2013 will be allowed to vote in city elections, including mayor, public advocate, borough president and city council. Councilman Ydanis Rodriguez, the prime sponsor of the legislation and an immigrant from the Dominican Republic, told CNN the bill is about championing the issue of \u201cno taxation without representation.\u201d \u201cIf they pay their taxes, they should be able to elect their leaders,\u201d said Rodriguez, who added that his own background as a green card holder from 1983 to 2000 has inspired his push for passage of the bill. The bill would expand voting rights to nearly 800,000 residents, according to Rodriguez\u2019s office. If passed, it would take effect on January 1, 2022, and make New York the largest jurisdiction to expand voting rights to noncitizens. Anu Joshi, vice president of policy at New York Immigrant Coalition, said the issue is about letting all city residents participate in the democratic process. \u201cThis is set to be a transformative piece of legislation that will really ensure that all New Yorkers \u2013 noncitizen New Yorkers who live here, who are raising children here, who shop in our stores, who own small businesses \u2013 the opportunity to have a say, in our democracy.  We think that we all will be better off when people who are invested in this city are able to participate in our democracy,\u201d Joshi said. The bill is expected to pass with a veto-proof supermajority of 35 of 51 council members in support. Critics of the legislation include Bronx Councilman Ruben Diaz, a Democrat, who has called the legislation \u201cdangerous and misguided.\u201d \u201cI fully support our immigrant community, but I also respect our laws and cherish my privilege as an American citizen to vote,\u201d Ruben said in a statement on Monday. The new legislation will task the city board of elections with creating a new municipal voter registration form, implementing staff trainings and notifying individuals of their new voting rights. However, a new set of voters could pose some challenges to city\u2019s elections board who in the last year has been plagued with election issues. In June, the NYC BOE botched the release of the city\u2019s first ranked choice voting results amid the mayoral primary. And in November 2020, nearly 100,000 voters received defective absentee ballots amid the 2020 general election due to a printing error the board blamed on the vendor, according to The New York Times. Additionally, election officials will need to make \u201cseparate municipal-only ballot for municipal voters\u201d if a city election includes federal questions or elections, according to Joshi. \u201cSo the Board of Elections will have ample time resources and support to ensure a successful implementation of this legislation. And we are prepared to hold them accountable to implementing the vote legislation fairly in time for the next New York City election in 2023,\u201d Joshi told CNN. The legislation has brought up some legal concerns, most recently from state Republicans who argue that the bill undermines the credibility of local elections and interferes with the integrity of state elections. The New York state GOP has vowed to take action against the legislation, including taking \u201cany legal action necessary to prevent the bill from becoming law.\u201d \u201cIf they [noncitizens] want to vote here, they should go through the process of becoming citizens, because that is how you show a real commitment to being a part of this city and this country. The stakes are too high, the problems we face in this city are too big, for us to give away the most quintessential right of American citizenship to someone who has only lived here for 30 days,\u201d said Council Minority Leader Borelli at the press conference last Friday. The 30-day requirement under the bill is in line with the current election requirement that all voters must reside in the city for 30 days before they can participate in an election. Richard Pildes, professor of constitutional law at New York University, told CNN that the bill falls within the city\u2019s right to determine who can vote in local elections. \u201cAs a constitutional or legal matter, it\u2019s as long as they are bona fide residents of the city, it doesn\u2019t violate the US Constitution to do it,\u201d said Pildes, who also noted that there is historical precedent for the issue. Some critics of the legislation argue it could discourage individuals from seeking citizenship. \u201cI understand if folks say, hey, I\u2019m somewhere on the pathway to citizenship, I\u2019d like to be more involved. I respect that. I do understand that impulse,\u201d said NYC Mayor Bill de Blasio at a press conference late in late November when expressing reservations about the bill.  \u201cBut I also have feelings about the value of citizenship and wanting to encourage people to become citizens fully, and there\u2019s a lot of people who do not pursue full citizenship, even though they can, and that to me is an issue.\u201d The mayor has said he won\u2019t veto the bill. Regardless, there is expected to be a veto-proof  majority of 34 lawmakers including support from the Speaker of the Council. Originally in New York state, according to a 2014 report from the City College of New York\u2019s Colin Powell School for Civic and Global Leadership, \u201cgave the vote to all white male residents \u2013 citizen or non-citizen \u2013 who owned property and declared allegiance to the state.\u201d By 1804, the state required citizenship to vote and nearly twenty years later, according to the report, state law defined citizenship loosely as American citizenship. Today, a handful of jurisdictions in the US allow noncitizens to vote Nine Maryland cities allow noncitizens to vote in local or school board elections including Takoma Park just outside of Washington, DC. Since 1993, legal residents have been able to vote in mayor and city council elections, according to Takoma Park Clerk Jessie Carpenter. \u201cWe pride ourselves on being a welcoming and inclusive city and allowing all our residents to vote is an important part of that,\u201d Carpenter said to CNN. San Francisco has allowed for noncitizens to vote in school board elections since voters passed a charter amendment in 2016. Noncitizens there were first able to vote in 2018, according John Arntz, the city\u2019s Elections Director. He said there hasn\u2019t been any issues with legal permanent residents voting with a handful of individuals participating. Earlier this year, two towns in Vermont \u2013 Montpelier and Winooski \u2013 extended the right to noncitizens to vote in local elections after Democrats in the state house overrode a veto from Republican Gov. Phil Scott. Meanwhile, noncitizen voting legislation is being considered in Massachusetts, Illinois and the District of Columbia. \u201cMy specific bill is part of a larger conversation around the push to ensure that people have a say so that people have a chance to be able to have their voices heard in their children\u2019s education, because school board leaders have a direct impact on that,\u201d Illinois Sen. Celina Villanueva told CNN. The Democrat introduced legislation this year that would allow for noncitizens to vote in school board elections.",

            "article_content": "Former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows on Tuesday became the latest Donald Trump acolyte to bow to the former President\u2019s ire, begging out of his scheduled deposition with the House committee investigating the January 6 riot \u2013 despite having given over key documents that will help build their case. But even as he dodges a face-to-face meeting, congressional investigators aren\u2019t done with Meadows. They plan to move forward with the former North Carolina congressman\u2019s scheduled interview on Wednesday, and possibly seek criminal contempt charges if he follows through on his planned no-show \u2013 setting up a legal clash that could land him in court, like fellow Trump ally Steve Bannon.

His goal, and those of other Trump allies, it seems, is to run down the clock on the committee, perhaps in hopes that its work will get tied up in legal fights that extend into the next Congress, when a potential GOP majority would surely shut it down. For now though, the select committee carrying out the probe into the armed assault on the Capitol has pledged to carry on seeking the truth despite Trump allies\u2019 bids to obscure it. The proceedings at which Meadows had been scheduled to take center stage will go on, Democratic Rep. Bennie Thompson of Mississippi and GOP Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming, who lead the committee, said in a joint response to Meadows\u2019 announcement. \u201cObviously, we had hoped Mr. Meadows would continue to work with the committee. But obviously based on his lawyer\u2019s letter today and his plan to not show up for the deposition, that creates a different dynamic,\u201d Thompson said later Tuesday. \u201cWe were prepared to go with contempt earlier, but we withheld it based on what we thought was an agreement that we\u2019d work together. That has not been the case.\u201d Despite his eleventh hour volte-face, Meadows might well have already delivered the probe new information of interest in the form of 6,000 pages of documents. A source familiar with the matter told CNN that the records already in the committee\u2019s possession include communications from January 6 and, though the specifics remain a mystery, \u201cmany people had Meadows\u2019 cell phone\u201d number. Democratic Rep. Pete Aguilar of California offered more detail late Tuesday, telling CNN\u2019s Annie Grayer that documents Meadows has already supplied the committee include evidence that he was in communication with \u201cindividuals that were responsible for the planning of (the rally on) January 6.\u201d Asked why he believes Meadows suddenly decided to clam up, Aguilar speculated that it was an attempt by Meadows to repair or save what\u2019s left of his relationship with Trump. Trump says Mark Meadows' Covid claim is 'fake news'. Hours later, Meadows agreed \u201cMaybe (Meadows\u2019) conflict was with his book tour,\u201d Aguilar said. \u201cThe only thing that really changed was the former President\u2019s posture. According to press reports, the former President wasn\u2019t happy with Mr. Meadows and a lot of these folks, just, you know, clearly as we saw on January 5 and 6, do whatever the former President wants.\u201d One more detail Trump most assuredly did not want made public came out nonetheless on Tuesday \u2013 with Meadows, again, as the messenger. In a newly publicized snippet from his tell-some memoir, \u201cThe Chief\u2019s Chief,\u201d it was revealed that the former President\u2019s blood oxygen levels dipped to a \u201cdangerously low level\u201d shortly after he announced he had tested positive for Covid-19 in October 2020. This follows, among other remarkable details, Meadows\u2019 recounting in the book how Trump went fishing for a negative test result after an earlier positive ahead of his first debate with then-candidate Joe Biden. In displeasing Trump, as he has with the book littered with unflattering revelations, Meadows risks a backlash from the MAGA audience he is counting on to juice sales. He is also now being measured against Bannon, the former top Trump adviser who is relishing his legal fight. Bannon livestreamed his November surrender to authorities as he chases after a profitable political martyrdom. \u201cThis is going to be the misdemeanor from hell for Merrick Garland, Nancy Pelosi and Joe Biden,\u201d Bannon told reporters last month as he held a court of his own outside the actual courtroom, at one point suggesting that he, like Trump, was being targeted by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, and said she should \u201cask Hillary Clinton how that turned out.\u201d Bannon, a judge announced on Tuesday, will not face trial on his contempt of Congress charges until July 18, during the heat of the 2022 midterm primary season. The Justice Department had asked for the proceedings to begin in April but ended up with a compromise date, with Bannon pushing for proceedings to be delayed until mid-October, weeks before the elections. Steve Bannon's contempt of Congress trial set for July 18 Meadows is a less melodramatic character, but, at least tactically, appears to be pursuing a similar route. In a letter to the committee, his attorney, George J. Terwilliger, contended that Meadows\u2019 decision to skip out on Wednesday\u2019s hearing was prompted by investigators\u2019 decision to subpoena \u201cinformation from a third party communications provider\u201d \u2013 likely meaning metadata about phone calls and texts that might reveal more about who was talking to whom and when before, during and after the riot. The nut of Meadows\u2019 argument is that, in seeking out a broader picture of what happened, the committee telegraphed plans to probe Meadows for what Terwilliger described as information protected by Trump\u2019s \u201cexecutive privilege.\u201d But Biden\u2019s office \u2013 now the arbiter of that privilege \u2013 has repeatedly refused to assert it over documents that Trump has sought to keep private. And, as Democrats have noted, Meadows\u2019 commitment to keeping presidential secrets did not extend to the writing and promoting of his insider memoir. Wednesday\u2019s hearing now will likely feature members of the select committee across from an empty chair \u2013 and not for the first time. Meadows declined to show up for questioning last month, on the same day a federal grand jury returned Bannon\u2019s indictment, which had been sought by the Justice Department for his own failure to testify. How a Bannon lawyer with civil rights creds became a Trump world go-to Timed to perfection on Tuesday, a group of right-wing Republican House members held a news conference to slam the January 6 committee\u2019s work, complain about the treatment of defendants in Capitol riot cases, and, courtesy of Florida Rep. Matt Gaetz, offer a preview of what\u2019s in store if his party wins control of the chamber next year. \u201cWe are going to take power after this next election. And when we do, it\u2019s not going to be like the days of (former House Speaker) Paul Ryan and (Rep.) Trey Gowdy and no real oversight and no real subpoenas,\u201d Gaetz said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be the days of (GOP Reps.) Jim Jordan, Marjorie Greene, Dr. (Paul) Gosar, and myself.\u201d Gaetz did not mention, when name-dropping Gowdy, that the former congressman from South Carolina had in fact overseen a long, politically driven investigation into the attack on Americans in Benghazi \u2013 which subpoenaed Clinton, who provided hours of live testimony \u2013 as part of an effort that current GOP Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy infamously described on Fox News in 2015 as a \u201cstrategy to fight and win.\u201d Democrats on the January 6 committee have mostly ignored the showmanship of the MAGA crowd and continue to project confidence that their work will ultimately produce the intended final product \u2013 a comprehensive report on the riot, crafted from testimony and evidence provided by the hundreds of people it has already interviewed. Former FBI deputy director Andrew McCabe, now a CNN law enforcement analyst, suggested Tuesday night on \u201cAnderson Cooper 360\u201d that Bannon himself was, at this point, likely a \u201clost cause for the committee.\u201d Indications are that at least a few of the members might agree and, slightly below the radar, are plumbing other Trump allies for potentially incriminating knowledge about the insurrection\u2019s planning, the deadly siege, or official efforts to cover up in the aftermath. The willingness to cooperate of those in former Vice President Mike Pence\u2019s orbit, including his former chief of staff Marc Short, is another wild card. Short was with Pence at the Capitol on January 6, as protesters outside called for his boss\u2019 murder, and is now assisting the committee, according to multiple sources with knowledge of its activities. CNN Exclusive: Top Pence aide cooperating with January 6 committee Team Trump has, unsurprisingly, been tougher to pin down as individuals weigh their interests alongside and against those of Trump, who never misses a slight. But Rep. Adam Schiff, a California Democrat and committee member, told CNN\u2019s Ryan Nobles that while Meadows\u2019 and Bannon\u2019s evasions are complicating the committee\u2019s work, the Justice Department\u2019s prosecution of Bannon has been an effective tool for encouraging other, lesser lights, to cooperate. As for those signaling they would invoke their Fifth Amendment rights to keep from answering questions, Schiff said the committee would treat them with appropriate skepticism. \u201cIf they\u2019re asserting the Fifth merely to cater to the President\u2019s whims or cover up for the President, that is not a proper use of the privilege,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we will have to do our best to divine whether they\u2019re properly invoking the Fifth or using it as a stratagem to keep information.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Marc Short, the former chief of staff to Vice President Mike Pence, is cooperating with the January 6 committee, a significant development that will give investigators insight from one of the highest-ranking Trump officials, according to three sources with knowledge of the committee\u2019s activities. CNN is also reporting for the first time that the committee subpoenaed Short a few weeks ago. Short remains one of Pence\u2019s closest advisers and is a firsthand witness to many critical events the committee is examining, including what happened to Pence at the Capitol on January 6 and how former President Donald Trump pressured the former vice president not to certify the presidential election that day. Short\u2019s assistance signals a greater openness among Pence\u2019s inner circle. One source told CNN the committee is getting \u201csignificant cooperation with Team Pence,\u201d even if the committee has not openly discussed that. Another source told CNN that Short\u2019s help is an example of the \u201cmomentum\u201d the investigation is enjoying behind the scenes. Last month, CNN reported that a number of figures close to Pence, including Short, may be willing, either voluntarily or under the guise of a \u201cfriendly subpoena,\u201d to cooperate with the committee. Reached by phone Monday and asked about his cooperation, Short told CNN \u201cno comment.\u201d The select committee declined to comment when reached by CNN. Short is considered one of Pence\u2019s most loyal aides and has worked for the former vice president on and off for more than a decade, including when Pence was a member of Congress. It\u2019s unclear whether Short\u2019s cooperation comes with Pence\u2019s blessing. Before working as Pence\u2019s chief of staff, Short was Trump\u2019s legislative director for the first 18 months of his presidency. Short was with Pence for most of January 6, including after the vice president was rushed out of the Senate chamber and moved to a safe location beneath the Capitol. Rioters had broken in to stop the certification of the presidential election, and some were chanting \u201chang Mike Pence.\u201d Short was also in the Oval Office on January 4, when Trump and conservative attorney John Eastman tried to convince Pence to delay the counting of the Electoral College votes. Angry with Short\u2019s role in backing Pence\u2019s refusal to comply, Trump told others that he banned Short from the White House after the Capitol riot, as CNN previously reported. News of Short\u2019s cooperation comes as the committee continues to negotiate with a number of former Trump officials. As CNN first reported last week, former Trump chief of staff Mark Meadows has agreed to cooperate with the committee, but the extent of his potential cooperation remains unclear, as he continues to assert executive privilege. CNN has also reported that Greg Jacob, Pence\u2019s former general counsel, has emerged as a person of significant interest to the committee. Jacob played a critical role in persuading the former vice president to certify the electoral results. Both Jacob and Short forcefully pushed back against the arguments from Eastman, who leaned on fringe legal theories in a controversial memo laying out how he claimed the vice president could overturn the election. Along with Short, the committee considers Jacob a valuable fact-witness in its investigation. CNN\u2019s Zachary Cohen contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "In a new memoir, Donald Trump\u2019s former chief of staff Mark Meadows doubles down on the baseless claim the 2020 election was stolen and whitewashed the violent attack on the US Capitol by Trump supporters on January 6, according to a copy of the book obtained by CNN. The book, titled \u201cThe Chief\u2019s Chief,\u201d spans nearly 300 pages and is set to be released next week. Meadows vigorously defends his former boss and peddles many of the debunked claims about alleged voter fraud and ballot irregularities that fueled the insurrection in the first place. Meadows absolves Trump of responsibility for the attack, giving just cursory details and echoing unfounded claims about the events of the day. Throughout the memoir, Meadows describes work-related conversations with Trump from his time at the White House, including private discussions about the election, efforts to find voter fraud and Trump\u2019s speech at the Ellipse near the White House on January 6. Meadows previously told the House select committee investigating the attack that conversations like these are shielded by executive privilege \u2013 but these new disclosures in his new memoir could undermine his privilege claims, said House Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff. \u201cHe clearly is waiving any claim he has to keep confidential his communications with the former President or what happened in the White House,\u201d Schiff, a California Democrat who is on the House select committee, told CNN\u2019s Don Lemon on Thursday. \u201cAfter all, if he can say it in a book, why he can\u2019t he say it before Congress in an investigation?\u201d Meadows is cooperating with the committee on some aspects of its subpoena, but privilege-related issues still aren\u2019t settled. His attorney didn\u2019t respond to questions Friday about whether Trump waived privilege for those portions of the book. The book touches on other key topics from the last year of Trump\u2019s presidency, ranging from Trump\u2019s battles with Pentagon leadership, the swift confirmation of Supreme Court Justice Amy Coney Barrett, and the disputed timeline regarding Trump\u2019s positive test for Covid-19 shortly before debating Joe Biden in fall 2020. The penultimate chapter of the book contains Meadows\u2019 perspective surrounding January 6. \u201cThe idea to gather on January 6 was organic,\u201d Meadows wrote, although he didn\u2019t discuss the Trump campaign officials, donors, informal advisers and family members deeply involved in the planning. \u201c(Trump) did not call for violence and he did not expect anyone would enter the Capitol Building,\u201d Meadows claims, even though Trump explicitly encouraged his supporters to march to the Capitol and \u201cfight like hell\u201d against the lawmakers who refused to overturn Biden\u2019s electoral victory. Meadows only revealed one conversation with Trump from January 6, saying that Trump ad-libbed when he said: \u201cwe\u2019re going to walk down\u201d to the Capitol, \u201cand I\u2019ll be there with you.\u201d \u201cWhen he got off stage, President Trump let me know that he had been speaking metaphorically about the walk to the Capitol,\u201d Meadows wrote. \u201cHe knew as well as anyone that we couldn\u2019t organize a trip like that on such short notice. It was clear the whole time that he didn\u2019t actually intend to walk down Pennsylvania Avenue with the crowd.\u201d The book correctly notes that only a fraction of rallygoers ended up inside the Capitol, and that some people were already wreaking havoc at the Capitol before Trump finished speaking. But Meadows\u2019 narrative that the throngs of supporters didn\u2019t take Trump\u2019s comments seriously has been contradicted by many of the rioters themselves. According to court filings, many of the rioters later said in FBI interviews that they didn\u2019t plan to go to the Capitol but were inspired by Trump\u2019s speech, and that they expected he would be there too. He summed up the insurrection as \u201cshameful\u201d and \u201cregrettable\u201d but claimed the violence was orchestrated by \u201ca small group of people\u201d and \u201ca handful of fanatics.\u201d Officials have said roughly 2,000 people breached the Capitol that day, and more than 680 people have been charged with federal crimes. There were hundreds of assaults against police officers, leading to 140 injuries. From the very first pages of the memoir, Meadows embraces and promotes the falsehood that Trump won the election. At one point, Meadows falsely claims nearly every person that voted for Trump last year believes the election was rigged. Referencing the \u201cforgotten men and women that Trump served so well,\u201d Meadows said, \u201cThere are more than 70 million of these people, all of whom believe they were cheated out of another four years of President Trump.\u201d A wide array of cybersecurity officials, federal judges and election officials from both parties, as well as post-election audits and recounts have confirmed that the 2020 election was not tainted. Trump lost the Electoral College vote and lagged behind Biden in the popular vote by more than 7 million ballots. Trump finished with roughly 74 million votes, compared to Biden\u2019s 81 million. Meadows does describe private conversations with Trump where he and other officials attempted to explain to the former President how he lost the election. Members of the select committee have said Trump\u2019s efforts to overturn the election are a key part of their investigation, and these disclosures could help the committee as it tries to pry loose details from Trump aides. In other sections of the book, Meadows outlines Team Trump\u2019s conspiracy theories about the election results. He claimed it was their duty to investigate the claims because they firmly believe Trump won by a wide margin, based on rally attendance and twitter traffic. He recounts a conversation with Trump where they were attempting to explain how he lost the election. \u201cI didn\u2019t know what to say to him, standing there in front of the Resolute Desk with some of the campaign\u2019s top advisors, when we he asked me what had put us so far behind in states that we were sure \u2013 as in dead certain \u2013 that we could win,\u201d Meadows wrote. Meadows details that others inside Trump\u2019s inner circle besides himself were made aware that he had tested positive for Covid-19 three days before he attended the first presidential debate in Cleveland. Meadows writes that as soon as Trump\u2019s physician, Dr. Sean Conley, called to inform him that then-President Trump had received a positive result on September 26, he dialed White House social media director Dan Scavino, who was on the Marine One helicopter at the time. \u201cTo my shock, Dan answered the phone, and he could hear about every other word I was saying to him,\u201d Meadows wrote in a copy of the book obtained by CNN. \u201cWhat he heard probably went something like: \u2018Dan\u2026 President\u2026 positive\u2026 Covid\u2026 keep\u2026 six feet\u2026 don\u2019t let anyone near \u2013.\u2019\u201d Meadows does not indicate whether Trump was tested again before hosting events at the White House over the days that followed, or before arriving to the debate hall in Cleveland later that week. \u201cWe\u2019ll probably never know whether President Trump was positive that evening,\u201d he writes. Trump said in a statement Wednesday, \u201cThe story of me having COVID prior to, or during, the first debate is Fake News. In fact, a test revealed that I did not have COVID prior to the debate.\u201d Several senior aides to Trump soon tested positive for Covid-19, including Stephen Miller and Kayleigh McEnany. Meadows claims he was informed of his positive result. Others who were constantly around the president, including Hope Hicks also tested positive soon after. In his book, however, Meadows declined to even consider that Trump may have transmitted the virus to his aides. \u201cWho, for instances, had infected Hope (Hicks), and where was that person now?\u201d he writes. \u201cEven in the debate prep sessions alone \u2013 where Hope, Chris Christie and Jared Kushner had all come within a few feet of him \u2013 would have been enough to infect him.\u201d This story has been updated with additional details Friday.",

            "article_content": "The House select committee investigating the January 6 attack on the US Capitol approved on Wednesday night the report to hold former Department of Justice official Jeffrey Clark in contempt of Congress for defying his subpoena by refusing to answer questions during a recent deposition and failing to hand over documents to the panel. But the panel is also giving Clark another opportunity to appear, on Saturday, in light of a new letter he sent to the committee stating that he intends to claim Fifth Amendment protection. A select committee aide tells CNN that due to Clark getting the new deposition date, the plan is to wait to hold a full House vote on the contempt report until at least after the weekend. If Clark answers the committee\u2019s questions by pleading the Fifth Amendment, the panel will likely have to stop the process of holding him in criminal contempt. If Clark continues to stonewall the committee, and invoke the Fifth Amendment in ways the committee deems illegitimate, the panel will proceed with a floor vote as soon as next week. Committee Chairman Bennie Thompson, a Mississippi Democrat, said in his opening remarks on Wednesday that Clark will be given the opportunity to appear in front of the panel on Saturday for a new deposition in light of him sending the new letter to the committee indicating that he intends to claim Fifth Amendment protection. \u201cEven though Mr. Clark previously had the opportunity to make these claims on the record, the Select Committee will provide him another chance to do so. I have informed Mr. Clark\u2019s attorney that I am willing to convene another deposition at which Mr. Clark can assert that privilege on a question-by-question basis, which is what the law requires of someone who asserts the privilege against self-incrimination,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cWe have just learned that Mr. Clark has agreed to appear again to continue his deposition.\u201d But Thompson said the committee would proceed with considering the contempt request, and all nine members voted to pass the report out of committee Wednesday night. Following passage in the House chamber, it would get referred to the Justice Department, which would then have to decide whether to prosecute. Republican Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming, the vice chair of the committee, said Wednesday that the committee \u201cwill not finalize his contempt process if Mr. Clark genuinely cures his failure to comply with the subpoena this Saturday.\u201d Rep. Jamie Raskin, who also serves on the committee, told CNN after the meeting that Clark\u2019s attempt to assert his Fifth Amendment right at this point in the process \u201cmay reflect an eroding confidence in the executive privilege argument.\u201d The Maryland Democrat warned, however, that pleading the Fifth will not be a simple process and it will still force Clark to confront specific questions about what he may or may not know about the events leading up to January 6. \u201cYou can\u2019t plead the Fifth to an entire prosecution. You can\u2019t plead the Fifth to every question you might be asked. So it applies only when you have a specific and reasonable apprehension that your answer could be used against you in a criminal prosecution,\u201d Raskin said. He pointed out that when asked a specific question Clark will be forced to confront what about the query may put him in a compromised legal situation: \u201cHe didn\u2019t state which criminal statutes he was referring to \u2013 whether it was election fraud or criminal conspiracy or whatever \u2013 but presumably he would have an opportunity to explain what are the underlying criminal statutes he\u2019s afraid of being prosecuted under.\u201d Although Raskin said the committee would not \u201cbegrudge anyone in honest invocation of the Fifth Amendment,\u201d he added that Clark\u2019s case to invoke it here is \u201ccertainly unusual\u201d and noted that Clark\u2019s former Justice Department superiors, Jeffrey Rosen and Richard Donoghue, had spoken to the committee without invoking the Fifth Amendment. The criminal contempt report marks another critical milestone in the investigation as the panel hopes that even the remote threat of jail time inspires more Trump-aligned witnesses to cooperate. A decision by Clark\u2019s former department to prosecute him on criminal contempt charges would make him the second person to face a serious legal penalty for blowing off the select committee\u2019s requests. Former President Donald Trump ally Steve Bannon is awaiting trial for a misdemeanor criminal contempt charge after he refused to show up for a deposition or provide documents to the committee, citing executive privilege claims made by Trump. The contempt report on Clark, which was released Tuesday night, outlines the efforts the committee made to get him to comply with the subpoena, and Clark\u2019s failure to do so. Hours before the meeting was scheduled to take place, Thompson told CNN the new letter to the committee suggested Clark may invoke his Fifth Amendment right to not answer the committee\u2019s questions. DOJ moves to limit Bannon media circus over January 6 investigation The letter indicated a new strategy by Clark, who has gone to great lengths to avoid cooperating with the committee, including claiming that any information he\u2019d be able to provide is protecting by either executive or attorney-client privilege. Clark has not formally invoked the Fifth Amendment with his dealings with the committee, but Thompson said his actions indicated that was the direction he was headed. The chairman made it clear, however, it was not something that would prevent the committee from moving ahead with its plans to refer him for criminal contempt. \u201cHe walked out on a deposition,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cThat kind of puts you in a weak position to make any type of assertion.\u201d Democratic Rep. Zoe Lofgren of California, one of the members on the panel described the new letter from Clark\u2019s legal team as \u201cfrivolous\u201d earlier in the day. \u201cThey\u2019ve just sent a very long letter that I\u2019ve read through that just seems like frivolous honestly, but I want the lawyers on the committee staff to give us their advice,\u201d Lofgren said. The latest in the January 6 investigation In its 22-page report, the committee said Clark had violated Justice Department policy when he met with Trump to discuss efforts to overturn the 2020 election and, further, held conversations with members of Congress about delegitimizing the election. The report states that the committee communicated with Clark\u2019s attorneys multiple times, even allowing an extension for them to produce records and appear for a deposition. But when Clark did finally appear, the committee said, his attorney handed the panel\u2019s staff a 12-page letter objecting to almost every question on the grounds that Trump was entitled to confidential legal advice \u2013 what Clark\u2019s attorney called a \u201csacred trust.\u201d The letter further argued that \u201cthe general category of executive privilege, the specific categories of the presidential communications, law enforcement, and deliberative process privileges, as well as attorney-client privilege and the work product doctrine, all harmonize on this point,\u201d according to the report. After being pressed to answer questions that the committee believed wouldn\u2019t justify executive privilege claims, Clark \u201cabruptly left\u201d the deposition. The documents Clark was asked to hand over included communications with Trump, senior members of the White House, Trump\u2019s reelection campaign, John Eastman \u2013 a conservative lawyer working with the then-President\u2019s legal team \u2013 and state officials. Ahead of the vote, Thompson said he felt confident the measure will pass the committee with ease, but did not guarantee a unanimous vote. \u201cI think we\u2019ve made the effort to be as agreeable as we can, and now it\u2019s time for us as a committee to make a decision and move on,\u201d Thompson said.  \u201cWe can\u2019t continue to waste time on a person who was subpoenaed who doesn\u2019t follow through on what\u2019s required.\u201d This story and headline have been updated to reflect additional developments Wednesday.",

            "article_content": "Democrats could not look any more vulnerable in the 2022 midterm elections, but Republicans are showing every day just how easily the GOP could torpedo its political chances next year. Infighting between moderates and loyalists to former President Donald Trump erupted into the open on Tuesday, while Trump continued his attempts to obscure the truth about the January 6 attack on the Capitol through the courts. While President Joe Biden\u2019s approval ratings have tumbled to new lows in recent months as Americans stress over the Covid-19 pandemic and a host of kitchen table issues, restive voters looking for different leadership may not take much heart as they watched the debacle unfolding in the Republican Party and the leadership\u2019s inability to handle it. As Trump hovers on the sidelines egging on GOP antagonists who have adopted his chaos-sowing tactics and vile rhetoric, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy tried unsuccessfully Tuesday to turn down the temperature in a roiling feud between freshman Republican Reps. Nancy Mace of South Carolina and Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia. Greene had started off the sniping by calling Mace \u201ctrash\u201d on Twitter for condemning the Islamophobic comments of her ally, Colorado GOP Rep. Lauren Boebert. Mace was one of the few Republicans to speak up after video emerged of Boebert delivering remarks at a November 20 event in Colorado, at which the firebrand Coloradoan told a story about a supposed elevator ride with Democratic Rep. Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, who is Muslim and wears a hijab. The punchline of the story ended with Boebert suggesting Omar is a terrorist. CNN\u2019s KFile on Tuesday uncovered a second video from a September dinner where Boebert called Omar \u201cevil\u201d and \u201cblackhearted\u201d and again suggested she was a terrorist. Boebert and Omar had a tense telephone conversation that did not go well on Monday. Boebert has refused to apologize for her inflammatory attacks on Omar and the GOP has not taken any disciplinary action against her. The spat spilled out to other members when Greene took issue with Mace\u2019s condemnation of Boebert\u2019s anti-Muslim remarks. The South Carolinian told CNN on Sunday that Boebert\u2019s statements were \u201cdisgusting.\u201d Greene, always eager for a public spat to burnish her credentials among her donors, attacked Mace\u2019s conservative credentials on Twitter and warned her to \u201cback up off\u201d Boebert. The back-and-forth between the two Republicans continued all day Tuesday with Greene taunting in one tweet that she\u2019d \u201cjust had a great conversation with President Trump about @NancyMace.\u201d The South Carolina Republican replied: \u201cI like my freshman colleagues who don\u2019t think 9/11 was a hoax\u2026\u201d \u2013 a reference to Greene\u2019s past embrace of conspiracy theories \u2013 \u201cThis one on the other hand\u2026 totally (nuts).\u201d Mace added that Greene\u2019s conversation with Trump amounted to running to the principal\u2019s office \u201cbecause she can\u2019t stand on her own two feet.\u201d In its totality, the embarrassing inter-party schism \u2013 and the lack of immediate consequences for Boebert\u2019s inflammatory comments \u2013 underscored that the gutter politics that Trump ushered into Washington have only gotten worse following his retreat from the White House. Lauren Boebert isn't sorry Republican leaders like McCarthy, whose chances of becoming speaker of the House hinge on maintaining the support of Trump and his hard-right acolytes, have not shown that they have any effectual way of dealing with the increasingly angry and toxic culture within the House of Representatives that has led to frightening threats against members, including Omar. No matter how outrageous or reckless the comments of Trump acolytes like Boebert and Greene get, they always seem to find protection in their closeness to the former President, whose tight grip on the party never seems to abate. In the absence of consequences, the behavior only seems to grow more abhorrent \u2013 and that could cost Republicans at the ballot box next year as they try to win back moderate and suburban voters who were alienated by Trump. At a news conference Tuesday evening, Omar called on Republican leaders to take action against Boebert stating that their \u201csilence speaks for itself.\u201d She played a voicemail she received hours after her call with Boebert on Monday in which a man told her there are plenty \u201cwho would love the opportunity to take you off the face of the earth.\u201d \u201cYou are a f\u2014ing Muslim piece of s\u2014. You Jihadist. We know what you are. You\u2019re a f\u2014ing traitor, you will not live much longer, b\u2014-,\u201d the voicemail said. Omar said condemning remarks that lead to that kind of rhetoric \u201cshould not be a partisan issue\u201d and added that \u201cwhen a sitting member of Congress calls a colleague, a member of \u2018the Jihad Squad\u2019\u201d \u2013 as both Boebert and Greene have done \u2013 \u201cand falsifies a story to suggest that I will blow up the Capitol, it is not just attack on me, but on millions of American Muslims across this country.\u201d She noted that anti-Muslim rhetoric used by Trump during his 2016 campaign served as a pre-cursor to the more recent taunts from his supporters. \u201cTo date, the Republican Party leadership has done nothing to hold their members accountable. It is time for the Republican Party to actually do something to confront anti Muslim hatred in its ranks,\u201d Omar said. On Tuesday night, CNN\u2019s Manu Raju and Melanie Zanona reported that McCarthy called both Greene and Mace into his office for separate meetings admonishing them to \u201cStop it.\u201d That seemed to have little effect, given that Greene told CNN after the meeting that both she and Trump would support a primary challenge to Mace in 2022. The South Carolinian made no apologies for her criticisms of Greene, suggesting that the Georgia congresswoman is stoking the feud to raise money: \u201cShe takes advantage of vulnerable Americans and vulnerable conservatives, and makes promises she cannot keep.\u201d Mace also argued that it was important to challenge Greene\u2019s lies. \u201cIt\u2019s incumbent upon members like myself to step up,\u201d she said, waiving off Greene\u2019s threat to support a primary challenge against her. \u201cI don\u2019t fear retribution, I don\u2019t fear the consequences.\u201d Charlie Dent, the former Pennsylvania Republican congressman who is a CNN contributor, said Tuesday night that the debacle demonstrated just how coarse American politics has become and called on GOP leaders to rein it in. \u201cIt\u2019s really incumbent upon leaders in Congress to try to set a better tone and tenor,\u201d Dent told CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer on \u201cThe Situation Room.\u201d \u201cThere used to be a time when members would debate policies and ideas and not lob insults at each other, or smears as in the case of Lauren Boebert on Representative Omar.\u201d \u201cI think it\u2019s now important for Kevin McCarthy to stand up and deal with these issues internally,\u201d Dent said. \u201cSome members have to be taught how to engage in a debate with their colleagues, and when they\u2019re at home, not to go out and say these kinds of reckless, insulting, inflammatory comments.\u201d While Trump\u2019s political sway over the Republican Party remains largely unchallenged, his attempts to control the flow of information to the House committee investigating the January 6 attacks faced two new key setbacks on Tuesday. While his tactics may still be setting the tone for the noxious political debate in Washington, the former President is not proving as effective in the courts as he tries to control what the country learns about what he knew in the leadup to the January 6 attack by his supporters on the Capitol. For months Trump has tried to thwart the work of the House select committee investigating the January 6 insurrection both by trying to block the release of documents they have requested from his administration through the courts \u2013 claiming they should be protected by executive privilege \u2013 and by steering former staffers to use that same line of defense to avoid questioning as by committee members. But the House committee shifted the power narrative in this battle of wills with the former President when they made it clear that there would be serious legal consequences for stonewalling them. Earlier this year, they set the process in motion for the indictment of Trump\u2019s former chief strategist Steve Bannon, who was charged with criminal contempt of Congress by a federal grand jury last month. On Monday, committee members made it plain that may not be a one-time circumstance as they indicated that they are poised to vote on a criminal contempt of Congress referral for Jeffrey Clark, a former top Department of Justice official who pushed unfounded claims of voter fraud after the November election while he was in close touch with Trump. Like Bannon, Clark had also refused to cooperate with the committee under the pretense that he could not testify until a court declares his communications with the former President are not shielded by attorney-client privilege or executive privilege. The threat of real legal jeopardy and possible jail time has clearly rattled potential witnesses. Facing the possibility of criminal contempt charges, CNN reported Tuesday that Trump\u2019s former chief of staff Mark Meadows has now reached a deal for initial cooperation with the committee. Democratic Rep. Bennie Thompson, who chairs select committee, told CNN that the panel has received \u201cprobably about 6,000 emails\u201d from Meadows via his lawyer. Meanwhile, Trump\u2019s lawyers faced a skeptical three-judge panel on the DC Circuit Court of Appeals Tuesday as they argued that the court should block the release of the presidential documents under his executive privilege claims even though the Biden administration believes they should be disclosed. The judges showed little interest in doing the document-by-document review that Trump has proposed and questioned why the former President\u2019s claim of executive privilege should carry more weight than Biden\u2019s administration\u2019s viewpoint that they should be released, in the interests of transparency about a day in which Trump supporters attempted a coup that almost upended America\u2019s democracy.",

            "article_content": "The news that former Trump White House chief of staff Mark Meadows is now cooperating with the House\u2019s January 6 select committee investigation represents a clear and present danger to the former president and his attempts to rewrite the history of that fateful day. \u201cHe has produced records to the committee and will soon appear for an initial deposition,\u201d committee chair Bennie Thompson told CNN of Meadows. \u201cThe Select Committee expects all witnesses, including Mr. Meadows, to provide all information requested and that the Select Committee is lawfully entitled to receive. The Committee will continue to assess his degree of compliance with our subpoena after the deposition.\u201d Meadows\u2019 cooperation marks a serious reversal from his stance earlier this month when he failed to heed a congressional subpoena to appear for a deposition about what he knew and when \u2013 both during the January 6 riot and in the days leading up to it. THE POINT -- NOW ON YOUTUBE! \nIn each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe! What changed his mind? It\u2019s impossible to know for sure, but the Department of Justice\u2019s decision to bring criminal contempt charges against former Trump White House political guru Steve Bannon \u2013 the same day that Meadows no-showed for his deposition \u2013 for refusing to cooperate with the committee could have something to do with it. As I wrote at the time: \u201cIn making a move to indict Bannon, Garland sends a clear signal to other Trumpists currently refusing to testify that the stakes for non-compliance are now very serious\u2026.Each charge of contempt carries the possibility of a year imprisonment as well as fines.\u201d Now, it\u2019s important to note that Meadows\u2019 willingness to work with the committee appears to extend only as far as providing some documents and agreeing to sit for an interview. It\u2019s not at all clear whether he will actually answer some of the most pressing questions that the committee has for him or provide all the documents they want from him. That said, the fact that Meadows is cooperating at all is a telling indicator of the growing power of the January 6 committee \u2013 and its increasing threat to Trump. Meadows served as Trump\u2019s chief of staff and \u2013 according to several books about the final days of the Trump presidency \u2013 was intimately involved in the discussions at the White House around contesting the 2020 Electoral College results. ABC\u2019s Jonathan Karl reported in his new book that Meadows forwarded a memo from Trump attorney Jenna Ellis that detailed how the January 6 Electoral College vote could be overturned to then-Vice President Mike Pence\u2019s office. And in \u201cPeril,\u201d a book by Bob Woodward and Robert Costa, the authors detail a January 2 meeting organized by Meadows in which South Carolina Sen. Lindsey Graham met with former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani and the rest of the president\u2019s legal team for a discussion on how to overturn the election results. Meadows\u2019 cooperation comes at an already-fraught time for Trump. Also on Tuesday, a DC appeals court heard arguments from the former president\u2019s lawyers about why his documents from January 6 should be protected by executive privilege and not released to the January 6 committee. As CNN noted about the hearing: Appeals court judges skeptical of Trump's arguments for blocking release of his January 6 documents \u201cAll three judges on the appellate panel Tuesday that\u2019s hearing former President Donald Trump\u2019s case seeking to block release of his January 6 documents signaled that they had skepticism about the arguments his lawyer was making in the case.\u201d If the court rules against Trump, Tuesday could well be seen as the day when everything \u2013 or at least many things \u2013 changed for Trump and the January 6 committee. Meadows\u2019 willingness to talk \u2013 and provide at least some documents \u2013 sends a very clear signal to other members of Trump\u2019s orbit who may have been weighing their options when it comes to resisting subpoenas from the committee: Don\u2019t do it. The more people close to Trump who talk, the more fulsome picture the public will get of what he did (and didn\u2019t do) in those last days of his time in the White House. And, if early indications are accurate, it won\u2019t look good for Trump.",

            "article_content": "Donald Trump\u2019s former chief of staff Mark Meadows is cooperating with the House select committee investigating the January 6 riot and is providing records and agreeing to appear for an initial interview, CNN first reported Tuesday. The move represents a critical shift in the relationship between the top Trump ally and the panel, and is staving off a criminal contempt referral for now. \u201cMr. Meadows has been engaging with the Select Committee through his attorney,\u201d Democratic Rep. Bennie Thompson of Mississippi, who chairs the committee, said in a statement. \u201cHe has produced records to the committee and will soon appear for an initial deposition. The Select Committee expects all witnesses, including Mr. Meadows, to provide all information requested and that the Select Committee is lawfully entitled to receive. The Committee will continue to assess his degree of compliance with our subpoena after the deposition.\u201d Thompson told CNN on Tuesday evening that the panel has received \u201cprobably about 6,000 emails\u201d from Meadows via his attorney and is \u201cin the process of going through it.\u201d He said Meadows\u2019 deposition is scheduled for next week. Meadows\u2019 lawyer George Terwilliger said in a statement to CNN that there is now an understanding between the two parties on how information can be exchanged moving forward, stating that his client and the committee are open to engaging on a certain set of topics as they work out how to deal with information the committee is seeking that could fall under executive privilege. But the agreement could be fragile if the two sides do not agree on what is privileged information. News of the understanding comes as Trump\u2019s lawyers argued in front of a federal appeals court in Washington that the former President should be able to assert executive privilege over records from the committee. \u201cAs we have from the beginning, we continue to work with the Select Committee and its staff to see if we can reach an accommodation that does not require Mr. Meadows to waive Executive Privilege or to forfeit the long-standing position that senior White House aides cannot be compelled to testify before Congress,\u201d Terwilliger said. \u201cWe appreciate the Select Committee\u2019s openness to receiving voluntary responses on non-privileged topics.\u201d The acknowledgment of the deal comes as multiple sources tell CNN that Meadows has shown a willingness to cooperate and has entered a new posture with the committee. The agreement is a significant step in the once-stalled relationship that comes after months of back-and-forth between the two parties. A running list of who has received a subpoena from the House January 6 select committee Even though Meadows has begun engaging with the committee in a more serious way, the extent to which he will fully cooperate and the question of what he will try to claim as executive privilege still hang in the balance, according to multiple sources. The agreement means the committee will hold off from pursuing criminal contempt against him, though that route always remains a possibility as this fragile step forward could be temporary. \u201cWell, you know they are providing information,\u201d Thompson said Tuesday evening of Meadows and his team. \u201cWe\u2019ll just have to see. But we\u2019ve taken it off the table for the time being.\u201d A source familiar with the process told CNN, \u201cIt\u2019s not incorrect to say he has cooperated to some extent, but he hasn\u2019t completely fulfilled his obligation and we need to see what happens. But Meadows doesn\u2019t want to be held in contempt.\u201d His engagement with the committee stands in stark contrast to Steve Bannon, who is charged with two counts of contempt of Congress for failing to testify and turn over documents in response to a subpoena from the committee, and former Department of Justice official Jeffrey Clark, who the committee will vote on a criminal contempt referral report on Wednesday. \u201cIt is fair to say he is not Bannon, and he is not Clark \u2026 and he doesn\u2019t want to be,\u201d the source said. \u201cBut how much he is cooperating and how much he will cooperate remains an open question. He has done some things \u2026 but he has not fulfilled all his obligations \u2026 and it is not entirely clear yet how much he will cooperate.\u201d \u201cWe can tell the difference between someone who is stalling or faking; we don\u2019t think that\u2019s what is going on here,\u201d the source added. Asked what he thinks changed Meadows\u2019 posture toward the committee, Thompson said Tuesday, \u201cI don\u2019t know specifically, but I think when Congress held Bannon in contempt and the fact that it appeared we were headed down that road with Meadows and Clark, you know, it causes one to decide whether or not, not engaging and following the law is worth going to jail.\u201d In recent weeks, members of the panel have said that many of the questions they have for Meadows have nothing to do with Trump \u2013 suggesting that the panel is still open to discussing the terms of a potential interview. Democratic Rep. Pete Aguilar, who serves on the panel, told CNN earlier this month that Meadows might have a \u201cminor claim\u201d to executive privilege over some conversations but emphasized the committee has questions for him that \u201chave nothing to do with the conversations he had directly with the President.\u201d The latest in the January 6 investigation \u201cHis conversations about stopping a free and fair election, about criticizing and stopping the counting of electoral votes, about his coordination with campaign officials on private devices that were not turned over, all of those issues are not privilege worthy and he has some explaining to do,\u201d the California Democrat added. Rep. Jamie Raskin, a Maryland Democrat and another select committee member, also told CNN earlier this month that the committee has \u201clots of questions (for Meadows) that have nothing to do with Trump personally.\u201d But the question of how executive privilege looms over Meadows\u2019 cooperation with the committee seems to have not prevented both parties from moving forward in their engagement, at least for now. Members of the panel, including Thompson, had grown frustrated with Meadows in recent weeks for his lack of engagement. Meadows even defied his deposition in front of the committee on November 12, which suggested the next step was a showdown that could lead the panel to begin a criminal referral process against him. Ahead of the scheduled deposition earlier this month, Terwilliger issued a statement saying his client would not cooperate with the committee until courts ruled on Trump\u2019s claims of executive privilege, noting \u201ca sharp legal dispute with the committee.\u201d But the tone seems to have shifted in recent days, and committee members have hinted that they will offer clarity on the situation with Meadows this week, perhaps as soon as Tuesday. Meadows slams McCarthy and suggests Trump should be elected speaker if Republicans win House \u201cI expect that there is going to be movement particularly on Mark Meadows that we\u2019ll know about shortly, in the next day, next two days or so. And I think the people will be pleased with that,\u201d Republican Rep. Adam Kinzinger said Monday on MSNBC\u2019s \u201cMorning Joe.\u201d Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff said on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d that the committee will make a decision \u201cthis week\u201d on whether it will refer Meadows for criminal contempt charges for defying the subpoena. Ahead of the news that Meadows is now cooperating with the committee, Aguilar said on CNN on Saturday that \u201cthere\u2019s still a small window in which (Meadows) can still comply here.\u201d \u201cAnd so we\u2019re keeping an eye on the calendar ahead this week and if Mr. Meadows does comply with the subpoena that he has been given, then we can prevent some of those steps,\u201d Aguilar added, referring to the route of criminal contempt that the committee always has had as an option at their disposal.

            "article_content": "The House select committee investigating the January 6 attack on the US Capitol is using Jeffrey Clark\u2019s refusal to answer questions during a recent deposition and failure to hand over subpoenaed documents to the panel to justify its plan to refer the former top Department of Justice official for criminal contempt of Congress. The committee\u2019s report outlines why the panel believes Clark is a central figure in the run-up to the riot and accuses him of attempting to use Justice Department authority to overturn the election. The request to refer Clark for possible criminal contempt charges helps to clarify the panel\u2019s definition of cooperation from its witnesses. The full House would have to vote to hold Clark in criminal contempt of Congress, setting up a referral to the Department of Justice, which would then have to decide whether to prosecute. A decision by Clark\u2019s former department to do so would make him the second person to face a serious legal penalty for blowing off the select committee\u2019s requests. Former President Donald Trump ally Steve Bannon is currently awaiting trial for a misdemeanor criminal contempt charge after he refused to show up for a deposition or provide documents to the committee, citing executive privilege claims made by former President Donald Trump. In a 22-page report, the committee said Clark had violated Justice Department policy when he met with Trump to discuss efforts to overturn the 2020 election and, further, held conversations with members of Congress about delegitimizing the election. The report states that the committee communicated with Clark\u2019s attorneys multiple times, even allowing an extension for them to produce records and appear for a deposition. But when Clark did finally appear, the committee said, his attorney handed the panel\u2019s staff a 12-page letter objecting to almost every question on the grounds that Trump was entitled to confidential legal advice \u2013 what Clark\u2019s attorney called a \u201csacred trust.\u201d The letter further argued that \u201cthe general category of executive privilege, the specific categories of the presidential communications, law enforcement, and deliberative process privileges, as well as attorney-client privilege and the work product doctrine, all harmonize on this point,\u201d according to the report. After being pressed to answer questions that the committee believed wouldn\u2019t justify executive privilege claims, Clark \u201cabruptly left\u201d the deposition. The documents Clark was asked to hand over included communications with Trump, senior members of the White House, Trump\u2019s reelection campaign, John Eastman \u2013 a conservative lawyer working with the then-President\u2019s legal team, and state officials.",

Over the course of a three hour and 40 minute hearing Tuesday, the judges expressed skepticism of Trump\u2019s claims, as they grappled with the question of what role courts should play in disputes when an incumbent president has declined to assert an executive privilege claim that a former president seeks to assert. \u201cThis all boils down to who decides. Who decides when it is in the best interest of the United States to disclose presidential records? Is it the current occupant of the White House or the former?\u201d said Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson of the DC Circuit Court of Appeals. The Trump team was battered with tough questions from the three judges, who signaled that they were not interested in doing document-by-document review of the records Trump says should be withheld. However, the judges also grilled lawyers for the House and President Joe Biden \u2013 who are in agreement that the documents should be disclosed \u2013 about scenarios where an assertion of privilege from a former president could trump a waiver of that privilege from the incumbent. \u201cWe don\u2019t just flip a coin or draw straws or something. What test are we supposed to use?\u201d Judge Robert Wilkins asked a lawyer representing the House. 'Patriots 45 MAGA Gang' planned violence on January 6, prosecutors say The arguments are likely to be an uphill battle for the former President. The Biden administration and the House are aligned against him in wanting transparency about communications in the West Wing as Trump sought to overturn the 2020 election result and his supporters raided the Capitol. Trump lost his first round in court in the case, more quickly and resoundingly than his losses when he tried to claim broad protections from investigations while he was President. Yet by raising major, unsettled questions about the power of former presidents to control information from their time in office, the case appears to be on a path to the Supreme Court. Trump has argued he should be able to assert executive privilege over records such as call logs and the handwritten notes of his top advisers. The Biden administration has declined to keep January 6-related White House documents confidential. \u201cAll three branches of government have acknowledged that there\u2019s a presidential \u2013 a right of former presidents to be able to challenge the designation in release of presidential records. The Congress did it through the adoption of the statute,\u201d Jesse Binnall, a lawyer for Trump, argued. The judges grilled Binnall on some of the procedural questions that have arisen in the case, before the arguments turned to the merits of Trump\u2019s arguments, which were presented Tuesday by Trump lawyer Justin Clark. Judge Patricia Millett, another member of the panel, questioned Clark\u2019s focus on the Trump presidential documents that have already been released to Congress without a challenge from Trump. Millett said that she did not see the case being about the content of the documents Trump is seeking to block, but what to do when there is a dispute between the current and former presidents over the records release. In a troubling sign for Trump, at least one judge on the panel said she had a different interpretation than the Trump team of a milestone Supreme Court opinion that Trump is depending on in the case. Jackson suggested that she did not see the 1977 decision in Nixon v. General Services Administration giving Trump the legal wiggle room to challenge in court the current president\u2019s decision to waive privilege. \u201cWhen you have a conflict of incumbent and former, [the] incumbent gets to decide,\u201d Jackson said. Millett also zeroed in on that case, asking Clark how much weight courts should give a current president\u2019s refusal to assert privilege over the documents. \u201cWe have one President at a time under our Constitution,\u201d is what that case said, Millett told Clark. Judge Robert Wilkins, the appellate panel\u2019s third member, brought up other court precedents from the Nixon era, and told Trump\u2019s legal team \u201cit seems your argument is inconsistent with our precedent.\u201d He was focused on Clark\u2019s claim that, in these disagreements between current and former presidents, courts might have to review the disputed records document-by-document. \u201cThat\u2019s not the way we say we do this, at least the way I read those cases,\u201d Wilkins said. Millett then dug in, with an even harsher set of questions for Clark. \u201cStop. Please stop!\u201d she said, cutting him off. Once the current president makes a call on executive privilege, \u201cYou say now the former president could say let\u2019s look at the documents\u201d in court to make confidentiality decisions, Millett said. \u201cIt changes the analysis not a wit for a court to say, \u2018It\u2019s executive privilege, it\u2019s not executive privilege,\u2019\u201d she said. Later in on, in her questions for Doug Letter, the lawyer representing the House\u2019s January 6 committee, Millett asked what limits there were in an incumbent president\u2019s ability to overrule an assertion of privilege by a former president. She asked Letter about a scenario where an incumbent was seeking the release of a former president\u2019s documents merely to \u201cavenge\u201d his predecessor, and she offered another hypothetical where a former president raised concerns about the release of presidential documents putting lives of foreign agents at risk. Wilkins put forth a scenario where courts were weighing an assertion of privilege by four former presidents against the waiver of that privilege by the incumbent. Letter acknowledged that there might be some \u201cweird\u201d scenario where the current president wasn\u2019t the ultimate arbiter of executive privilege, but he stressed that those hypotheticals were very far from the case before the court. Brian Boynton, the Justice Department attorney arguing on behalf of the Biden administration said that for now the DC Circuit could avoid saying whether courts could ever side with former president over an incumbent in such disputes. \u201cThis really should be a straightforward case \u2026 President Biden\u2019s decision was eminently reasonable,\u201d Boynton said. The National Archives was set to begin turning over records this month to Congress, but Trump\u2019s lawsuit has put that on hold, potentially slowing parts of the House committee\u2019s investigation. Trump has also warned the appeals court against giving Congress too much power. The House said it needs the more than 700 pages of disputed Trump White House records, from close advisers including then-chief of staff Mark Meadows and press secretary Kayleigh McEnany, so it can learn enough about Trump\u2019s efforts for Congress to make laws that could protect future elections. The Biden administration has endorsed the House learning as much as it can about Trump and the attempted coup. Judge Tanya Chutkan of the DC District Court previously smacked down all of Trump\u2019s arguments in the case. \u201cPresidents are not kings, and Plaintiff is not President,\u201d she wrote in her opinion earlier this month. Presidential privilege \u201cexists for the benefit of the Republic, not any individual,\u201d Chutkan also wrote. Now the DC Circuit Court of Appeals could rule quickly. The panel of appellate judges \u2013  Millett, Wilkins and Jackson \u2013 are all appointed by Democrats and moved fast to schedule the case for argument, bringing it before them only three weeks after Chutkan ruled. Jackson is already known to oppose Trump\u2019s broad executive privilege claims, having written years ago that \u201cpresidents are not kings\u201d when Trump tried to block a congressional subpoena of his former White House counsel, Don McGahn. So far the panel has shown an inkling of doubt. Last week, they told Trump, the House and the Biden administration to be prepared to address questions of whether the court can even decide a case like this \u2013 in addition to the arguments the parties are already prepared to make. Former DOJ official could be second person to face contempt charges for defying January 6 committee Wilkins also has been a strong voice on recent politically charged cases. He wrote a strong dissent against the dismissal of former Trump national security adviser Michael Flynn\u2019s guilty plea in 2020 and authored the opinion that set the standard for the jailing of Capitol riot defendants before their trials. Four collections of records from the Trump White House that have been reviewed by the National Archives are poised to go to the House committee if Trump ultimately loses the appeal. Witnesses subpoenaed by the House, including Meadows himself, have used the ongoing court case as a shield to skirt testifying. Currently, the appeals court has put a temporary hold on the National Archives releasing the records Trump contests, pending its issuance of another order. \u201cThe concern here is, we are on a timeline \u2013 in terms of a 30 day timeline \u2013 and getting a preliminary injunction so we can hash out these issues is really important on our end, and that\u2019s where I think we are,\u201d Clark, the Trump attorney, said.

            "article_content": "The House select committee investigating the January 6 US Capitol riot is touting its extensive number of interviews and subpoenas, but a court hearing Tuesday may determine how much lawmakers will eventually be able to accomplish in their probe. Here\u2019s what\u2019s next and what you may have missed in the investigation: A three-judge panel of the DC Circuit Court of Appeals will hear former President Donald Trump\u2019s latest effort to stop the National Archives from turning over documents from around January 6 to the House. Trump's next January 6 circus looms after Stone and Jones are subpoenaed Trump is claiming executive privilege, but the current White House says that\u2019s not his call to make anymore and is happy to assist the investigation. A district court judge ruled against Trump, writing: \u201cPresidents are not kings. And Plaintiff is not President.\u201d But the handover is on hold pending the appeal. The panel subpoenaed five Trump allies directly involved in planning \u201cStop the Steal\u201d rallies, including longtime Republican operative Roger Stone and conspiracy theorist Alex Jones. Dustin Stockton and Jennifer Lawrence, key players in the \u201cStop the Steal\u201d movement after the election, and Taylor Budowich, who is currently the primary political spokesperson for the former President and serves as communications director for the Save America PAC, were also issued subpoenas. Also getting subpoenas was 1st Amendment Praetorian, a group founded in 2020 that recruits military veterans and former police officers to provide security at right-wing events. What is the 1st Amendment Praetorian, the obscure far-right group subpoenaed by the January 6 committee? The group provided security at pro-Trump rallies in November and December 2020 that were followed by violence and arrests on the streets of DC. The group\u2019s founder, Robert Patrick Lewis, was a featured speaker at a January 5 event. He invoked the American Revolution in his brief address to the crowd, where he compared the \u201cStop the Steal\u201d movement to George Washington\u2019s surprise attack on pro-British troops after crossing the Delaware River in 1776, CNN\u2019s Marshall Cohen reported. The cat-and-mouse game with former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows continues. Rep. Adam Schiff, a California Democrat who\u2019s a member of the House select committee, told CNN over the weekend that the committee will decide \u201cthis week\u201d on whether it will refer Meadows for criminal contempt charges for defying a subpoena earlier this month, failing to turn over documents or appear for a deposition. Schiff told CNN Sunday: \u201cI can\u2019t go into \u2026 what communications that we\u2019re having or haven\u2019t had with particular witnesses, but we are moving with alacrity with anyone who obstructs the committee, and that was certainly the case with Mr. (Steve) Bannon,\u201d referring to the Trump ally who is pleading not guilty to the criminal contempt of Congress charges against him. \u201cIt will be the case with Mr. Meadows, and Mr. (Jeffrey) Clark or any others.\u201d Former Justice Department official Jeffrey Clark earlier this month stonewalled the House select committee, responding to a subpoena demanding he appear for an interview with the panel, but not answering questions posed to him, sources familiar with his appearance told CNN at the time. Democratic Rep. Pete Aguilar of California, another select committee member, told CNN\u2019s Jim Acosta on Saturday that Meadows still has a \u201csmall window in which he can still comply here \u2026 But if he doesn\u2019t comply, the committee has made very clear just as we did with Steve Bannon that we\u2019re willing to use whatever means necessary.\u201d Committee members said recently that many of the questions for Meadows have nothing to do with Trump himself and that they wouldn\u2019t be subject to an executive privilege argument. RELATED: Meadows slams McCarthy and suggests Trump should be elected speaker if Republicans win House Aguilar previously told CNN of Meadows: \u201cHis conversations about stopping a free and fair election, about criticizing and stopping the counting of electoral votes, about his coordination with campaign officials on private devices that were not turned over, all of those issues are not privilege worthy and he has some explaining to do.\u201d",

            "article_content": "The House select committee investigating the January 6 insurrection will make a decision \u201cthis week\u201d on whether it will refer Mark Meadows for criminal contempt charges for defying a subpoena before the Thanksgiving recess, California Rep. Adam Schiff, a member of the panel, said Sunday. \u201cI think we will probably make a decision this week on our course of conduct with that particular witness and maybe others,\u201d Schiff told CNN\u2019s Dana Bash on \u201cState of the Union.\u201d \u201cI can\u2019t go into \u2026 what communications that we\u2019re having or haven\u2019t had with particular witnesses, but we are moving with alacrity with anyone who obstructs the committee, and that was certainly the case with Mr. Bannon. It will be the case with Mr. Meadows, and Mr. Clark or any others.\u201d The looming decision by the committee comes amid attempts to try to get Meadows \u2013 the former White House chief of staff for former President Donald Trump, who defied his subpoena from the panel and did not show up for a deposition \u2013 to comply with the panel\u2019s request as it seeks more information about the events at the US Capitol on January 6. The committee has already referred criminal contempt charges for former Donald Trump ally Steve Bannon and last week issued new subpoenas to five allies of the former President, including Roger Stone and conspiracy theorist Alex Jones. Former Justice Department official Jeffrey Clark earlier this month stonewalled the House select committee, responding to a subpoena demanding he appear for an interview with the panel, but not answering questions posed to him, sources familiar with his appearance told CNN at the time. Schiff also told Bash one of the main questions the committee is looking into is Trump\u2019s involvement. \u201cAnd I can\u2019t go into the evidence that we have gathered, but I will say this, I think among the most important questions that we\u2019re investigating is the complete role of the former president,\u201d the Democrat said. Meadows, who was still serving in the White House when the riots at the US Capitol took place, has a potentially plausible case to be made for executive privilege. CNN previously reported that two committee members indicated there are several lines of inquiry that would not be covered by executive privilege regarding Meadows. Rep. Pete Aguilar, a Democrat who is also a member of the committee, told CNN earlier this month that Meadows may have a \u201cminor claim\u201d to executive privilege over some conversations but stressed the committee has questions for him that \u201chave nothing to do with the conversations he had directly with the President.\u201d Aguilar told CNN\u2019s Jim Acosta on Saturday that Meadows still has a \u201csmall window in which he can still comply here \u2026 But if he doesn\u2019t comply, the committee has made very clear just as we did with Steve Bannon that we\u2019re willing to use whatever means necessary.\u201d Earlier this month, the White House indicated that concessions do not need to be made for Meadows, notifying him that President Joe Biden will not assert executive privilege or immunity for him on matters related to the probe. Schiff also suggested Sunday he would like for the Department of Justice to be more aggressive in investigating Trump\u2019s efforts to overturn the election in certain states, such as Georgia. \u201cI am concerned that there does not appear to be an investigation, unless it\u2019s being done very quietly by the Justice Department, of for example the former president on the phone with the Georgia Secretary of State, asking him to find, really demanding he find 11,780 votes that don\u2019t exist,\u201d he told Bash.

            "article_content": "Steve Bannon turned the January 6 committee into a politicized spectacle but Alex Jones and Roger Stone could conjure a theater of the absurd out of the probe into one of the most jarring assaults on democracy in US history. The Infowars demagogue and the Nixonian self-proclaimed \u201cdirty trickster\u201d became the latest acolytes of ex-President Donald Trump to get hit by subpoenas by the House select committee on Monday. The move was another indication the panel is digging into the organization and funding of Trump\u2019s \u201cStop the Steal\u201d rally, in which both men were allegedly involved, which mushroomed into the Capitol insurrection. Their testimony \u2013 should they appear before the panel \u2013 could shed light on the key question for the committee about whether the rally had a pre-ordained purpose to trigger an uprising designed to halt the congressional certification of Joe Biden\u2019s election win. The subpoenas underscored a fast-track strategy by a Democratic-led committee that is unlikely to survive if Republicans, who have long protected Trump, win the House in next year\u2019s midterm elections. The panel is working feverishly and has interviewed more than 200 witnesses, including many members of the Trump administration who came forward voluntarily. But given the penchant of Stone and Jones for histrionic legal fights, the committee is unlikely to expect quick cooperation. Past behavior is not always predictive, and Stone especially has just emerged from a costly legal fight after his conviction for lying to Congress in another Trump-related case, for which he was pardoned by the ex-President. But like Jones, he has a long record of using moments of accountability to stage political stunts and promote extremism. Stone said in a statement that he had \u201cno advance knowledge\u201d of the events at the Capitol on January 6 and that any claim or report alleging or implying he did was \u201ccategorically false.\u201d He later told CNN affiliate KOKI he would \u201cwould probably assert my 5th Amendment right, decline to be interviewed.\u201d The committee has also shown it is ready to hold recalcitrant witnesses to account, after the House cited Bannon, another longtime Trump political adviser like Stone, for criminal contempt. The Justice Department has initiated a prosecution. Like Bannon, neither Jones nor Stone appears to have a strong case to claim contacts with Trump are shielded by executive privilege since neither were serving as administration officials. But arguing the point in court could use time that the committee does not have given grim prospects for Democrats of keeping the House in 2022. Former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, who has a stronger claim to executive privilege, is locked in a standoff with the committee. He is refusing to testify but has not been cited for contempt. The reputations of Stone and Jones, who are both political bomb throwers who pushed the lie that Trump won the election, suggest that neither will be able to resist the notoriety of a public duel with the panel. \u201cIf you think Steve Bannon upped the drama queen value on responding to a charge of a misdemeanor, my guess is we ain\u2019t seen nothing yet,\u201d said Andrew McCabe, a former deputy director of the FBI who is now a senior CNN law enforcement analyst. But Democratic Rep. Zoe Lofgren of California \u2013 a committee member who, as a law student worked in Congress on the Watergate scandal involving Stone\u2019s mentor, President Richard Nixon \u2013 said that Stone and Jones had no option but to testify. \u201cYou don\u2019t lie to Congress or else you\u2019re going to fall into other trouble, criminal law trouble. They are characters, but they have to come in and tell the truth,\u201d she said on CNN\u2019s \u201cThe Situation Room.\u201d Stone and Jones were not the only new witnesses targeted on Monday. The committee also sent subpoenas to Dustin Stockton and Jennifer Lawrence, key players in the \u201cStop the Steal\u201d movement, and Taylor Budowich, who currently serves as Trump\u2019s spokesman. A new round of exhibitionism by spotlight-hungry members of Trump\u2019s orbit will not disguise the critical purpose of the committee. Trump, after all, tried to use the powers of the presidency to violate the will of voters and to destroy democratic institutions based on a lie of a stolen 2020 election. And given that Trump could run again for the White House as an unmasked wanna-be autocrat, the panel\u2019s eventual findings could be vital reading for voters in 2024. The ex-President\u2019s selfish refusal to accept the will of voters was laid bare in a Washington court room on Monday. In a plea hearing for a Capitol riot defendant, federal Judge Reggie Walton compared Trump to former Vice President Al Gore after the Supreme Court decided the disputed 2000 election in George W. Bush\u2019s favor. \u201cAl Gore had a better case to argue than Mr. Trump, but he was a man about what happened to him,\u201d Walton said. \u201cHe accepted it and walked away.\u201d In another stark reminder of the stakes for the committee, unsealed documents revealed an apparent threat to House Speaker Nancy Pelosi from Mark Mazza of Indiana, who was charged with carrying a loaded firearm onto the Capitol grounds. Mazza told investigators that if he had reached the speaker\u2019s office on January 6, they\u2019d \u201cbe here for another reason.\u201d Besides seeking testimony from officials and outside allies who were close to Trump and his campaign, the January 6 committee has been fighting him in court over his effort to assert executive privilege over memos, schedules, visitor logs and other documents related to the January 6 period. Lawyers for the House said in a court filing on Monday that the investigators needed the ex-President\u2019s private papers in order to consider legislation to prevent future repeats of the insurrection. \u201cAny inquiry that did not insist on examining Mr. Trump\u2019s documents and communications would be worse than useless\u2014the equivalent of staging a production of Hamlet without the Prince of Denmark,\u201d their filing said. Stone has rarely been far from controversy since Trump transformed American politics by launching his campaign in 2015. He was found guilty in November 2019 of lying to and obstructing Congress in a case that shed light on the extent of Trump\u2019s knowledge about the release of stolen Democratic emails in 2016 by Wikileaks. So he has already established his reputation as a witness who is unlikely to turn on the ex-President. In an unrelated tax case Monday, his attorneys argued he was being hounded over his support for Trump. \u201cThis case would never have been brought if it didn\u2019t involve Roger Stone,\u201d the filing said. The House select committee has previously issued several subpoenas to organizers of rallies in Washington, DC, on January 5 and 6 that preceded the insurrection. CNN has reported that the investigation has included questions about security forces at the rallies and those associated with Stone and others. Court records show prosecutors accused two members of the far-right extremist group the Oath Keepers of text messaging about providing security to Stone. An Oath Keeper who appeared to be protecting Stone on January 6 later joined an angry mob outside the Capitol, according to video and images reviewed by CNN and four sources who confirmed his identity. In its letter to Jones, the committee stated that he was denied a speaking spot at the January 6 rally but that his previous comments indicate he was designated to \u201clead a march to the Capitol, where President Trump would meet the group.\u201d The committee acknowledged that once at the Capitol, Jones told people \u201cnot to be violent.\u201d Trump never showed up on Capitol Hill. Jones\u2019 subpoena landed less than two months after he was found legally responsible in two lawsuits for damages caused by his false claim that the 2012 school massacre in Newtown, Connecticut, in which 26 people including 20 young children died, was a hoax. Lofgren told CNN\u2019s Jim Acosta on \u201cThe Situation Room\u201d that Stone had raised money for security for the \u201cStop the Steal\u201d rally through his websites and that Jones had claimed to raise most of the cash needed to stage the January 6 event. There is nothing wrong with staging a political rally. Even Trump\u2019s lies about the election being stolen are protected free speech. But the committee appears to be trying to find out whether the Capitol riot was a direct mob reaction to those lies peddled by Trump at the rally or if the ex-President or those in his orbit specifically laid the groundwork for the protest turning into an insurrection.

            "article_content": "The Biden administration said in a court filing on Monday that the House select committee\u2019s investigation into January 6 is needed to fully understand former President Donald Trump\u2019s role in the US Capitol attack, arguing that his presidential records be turned over to Congress. Lawyers from the Justice Department \u2013 representing the Biden administration, including the National Archives, which holds the Trump-era records \u2013 said that the House has \u201csufficient reason\u201d to try to learn what Trump and others knew before the violence. The filing came as Trump  tries to overturn a lower-court decision and keep the records secret. \u201cFar from \u2018fishing,\u2019 or looking to the former President and his advisors as a \u2018case study,\u2019 the Select Committee is investigating known events involving the former President and other White House officials and relating to a singular attack on the Capitol,\u201d the Justice Department lawyers wrote. It\u2019s unusual for Congress and the executive branch to be so aligned in a court case over presidential powers, and the Biden administration has taken up many of the same arguments the House is making about why it needs to investigate. Previously, the Biden administration said it would not assert executive privilege to protect Trump-era residential records because of the \u201cunique and extraordinary\u201d nature of the Capitol siege. New January 6 committee subpoenas issued for 5 Trump allies including Roger Stone and Alex Jones The argument in the legal brief is some of the strongest language yet from the Biden administration endorsing the House probe into Trump. \u201cThe Select Committee thus has sufficient reason to probe, among other things: (1) what, if anything, the former President, his advisors, other government officials, and those close to him knew about the likelihood of the protest turning violent; (2) when they knew it; (3) whether they sought to encourage or prevent it and the actions they took in response; and (4) how, if at all, their actions facilitated, exacerbated or led to the violence that overtook the protest,\u201d lawyers from the Biden administration wrote. Also in a Monday court filing, lawyers for the House said they need to investigate the former President\u2019s private papers as they seek to consider legislation aimed at protecting future elections. The House wants the records soon, and the lawyers argued against letting the court process drag out. \u201cFuture elections are imminent and there could be future attacks on democracy rooted in conduct occurring well before the election,\u201d the lawyers wrote. \u201cThe Select Committee\u2019s task to study and suggest legislation to ensure that January 6 is not repeated, and that our Nation\u2019s democracy is protected from future attacks, is urgent.\u201d To counter Trump\u2019s claims that his public statements are already available, and so records of White House discussions aren\u2019t needed, the House invoked Shakespeare. \u201cAny inquiry that did not insist on examining Mr. Trump\u2019s documents and communications would be worse than useless\u2014the equivalent of staging a production of Hamlet without the Prince of Denmark,\u201d their filing said. Both the Biden administration and the House filed their arguments to the DC Circuit Court of Appeals on Monday, and are unified in believing the Trump White House records related to January 6 should be released to the House. Trump sued to keep the records secret, saying he should have a say in executive privilege claims as an ex-president, and lost at the trial-level court. A three-judge panel at the federal appeals court is set to hear arguments on November 30. The National Archives is temporarily paused from turning over the disputed documents, such as call logs and notes from Trump\u2019s chief of staff and press secretary, as the appeals court considers the matter. The case tests major questions about executive privilege, congressional inquiries and the power of a former President.",

            "article_content": "Members of the House committee investigating January 6 said on Thursday that many of the questions they have for former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows have nothing to do with then-President Donald Trump \u2013 suggesting that the panel is still open to discussing the terms of a potential interview. The House select committee has been trying to get Meadows to comply after he defied its subpoena, failing to turn over documents and show up for his deposition last week. Two committee members indicated there are several lines of inquiry that would not be covered by executive privilege. Rep. Pete Aguilar told CNN on Thursday that Meadows, one of Trump\u2019s closest advisers, might have a \u201cminor claim\u201d to executive privilege over some conversations but emphasized the committee has questions for him that \u201chave nothing to do with the conversations he had directly with the President.\u201d \u201cHis conversations about stopping a free and fair election, about criticizing and stopping the counting of electoral votes, about his coordination with campaign officials on private devices that were not turned over, all of those issues are not privilege worthy and he has some explaining to do,\u201d the California Democrat added. Rep. Jamie Raskin, another select committee member, also told CNN on Thursday that the committee has \u201clots of questions {for Meadows} that have nothing to do with Trump personally.\u201d \u201cWe want Meadows to come in and testify on everything of interest to us,\u201d he said. \u201cIf he thinks there are some questions that are covered by either executive privilege or the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination, he can invoke it and a court can settle it later.\u201d \u201cBut there are certainly a lot of questions that are not even arguably tangentially related to privilege. And those you have to answer,\u201d the Maryland Democrat added. The statements come after the current White House indicated last week that concessions do not need to be made for Meadows, notifying him that President Joe Biden will not assert executive privilege or immunity for him on matters related to the probe. The day after that notification, Meadows was a no-show for a scheduled deposition. What's next in the investigation of January 6 Previous congressional inquiries have made concessions to close presidential aides. In the late 2000s, in a legal battle over getting testimony from former White House counsel Harriet Miers, the Obama White House engineered a deal that allowed a House committee to conduct interviews it wanted with Miers and former White House chief of staff Josh Bolten by making questions about direct communications with former President George W Bush off limits. A select committee aide told CNN that the panel has not taken any subjects in a potential interview with Meadows off the table and expects to get all the information it is seeking. Meadows\u2019 attorney did not respond to CNN\u2019s questions about possible negotiations on Thursday. Ahead of his scheduled deposition last week, Meadows\u2019 attorney, George J. Terwilliger III, issued a statement saying his client would not cooperate with the committee until courts had ruled on former President Donald Trump\u2019s claims of executive privilege, noting \u201ca sharp legal dispute with the committee.\u201d Aguilar also noted Thursday that there are ways to discuss specific claims of privilege but Meadows is still required to talk to the committee. \u201cIf there were privileged claims, there\u2019s a way to address them. What Meadows is saying is he has absolute privilege; he doesn\u2019t have to have conversations with us. The courts don\u2019t agree with that, past precedent hasn\u2019t agreed with that, and Congress has never indicated with that,\u201d he told CNN later Thursday, expanding on his previous comments. Aguilar added that the record the committee is building shows the large portion of the information it is looking for does not relate to the executive privilege claims that Meadows is making. Last week, White House Deputy Counsel Jonathan Su wrote to Meadows\u2019 attorney, informing him of Biden\u2019s decision, and once again cited \u201cthe unique and extraordinary circumstances where Congress is investigating an effort to obstruct the lawful transfer of power under our Constitution.\u201d Ex-Trump White House official calls January 6 committee's process 'comprehensive and deliberative' Su noted that Biden has already determined that executive privilege does not apply to particular subjects within the committee\u2019s purview, including \u201cevents within the White House on or about January 6, 2021; attempts to use the Department of Justice to advance a false narrative that the 2020 election was tainted by widespread fraud; and other efforts to alter election results or obstruct the transfer of power.\u201d The chairman of the House select committee, Democratic Rep. Bennie Thompson of Mississippi, said Wednesday that he was signing a letter to send to Meadows outlining everything the committee wants to learn from him, as the panel weighs whether to pursue a criminal contempt referral. This letter would be key to marking the trail of communication between Meadows and the committee, and crucial to building out an eventual criminal contempt referral report, if the committee chooses to go that route. A key question that the committee has said it wants answered by Meadows is whether he was using a private cell phone to communicate on January 6 and where his text messages from that day are. \u201cWe have information that that phone may or may not be in his possession. That number is not active anymore that he used, so we just want to know,\u201d Thompson has said.",

            "article_content": "Lawyers for right-wing firebrand Steve Bannon made clear at a court hearing Thursday that they intend to slow down, as much as possible, the criminal case against Bannon for failing to testify to the House January 6 select committee. \u201cWe\u2019ll have to learn exactly what was done to bring these charges,\u201d said Evan Corcoran, an attorney for Bannon. He cited \u201ccomplex constitutional issues at play,\u201d including former President Donald Trump\u2019s own lawsuit over records from his White House. RELATED: Bannon judge represented Bush Justice Department in executive privilege fights Bannon judge represented Bush Justice Department in executive privilege fights Prosecutors from the Justice Department countered that the cases is simple and want to move quickly. They say they have only 200 documents to use as evidence, which would be largely the correspondence Bannon had with lawyers for Trump, who told him not to testify, and with the House, which demanded his compliance. In court Thursday, prosecutor Amanda Vaughn called Bannon\u2019s case straightforward, about the failure to show up. She said the DOJ sought to move forward with turning evidence over to the defense quickly, and wanted to set a trial date. Corcoran said his team wanted time to identify witnesses that could help Bannon\u2019s defense. The attorney also said the defense team wanted more documents from the executive branch and Congress than prosecutors had collected so far \u2013 an assertion that drew some doubt from the judge, and may not be feasible for Bannon, as a private citizen, to collect. \u201cThe key here is our ability to identify the documents and the witnesses to allow us to identify a defense for Mr. Bannon,\u201d he said. It was Bannon\u2019s first appearance before US District Judge Carl Nichols, who will oversee his case and any potential trial for contempt of Congress, and the first time Bannon\u2019s lawyers have laid out their strategy on timing of the case. Also at the hearing, Nichols accepted Bannon\u2019s plea of not guilty, setting in motion the path to trial. In the coming months, Nichols will have the ability to control when a trial arrives \u2013 a key factor as the House Select Committee races against the countdown to the 2022 election to gather information about Trump\u2019s election fraud push. So far, House members on the committee have moved quickly to hold Bannon in contempt and enlist the DOJ to prosecute the misdemeanor charges, with the hope that progress in a criminal case against the well-known Trump ally could pressure reluctant witnesses to comply with subpoenas. Neither party will get what it wanted immediately. Nichols said he wasn\u2019t sure either side was correct regarding timing of a trial. The judge put in place dates in the coming weeks to move forward on some steps needed before a trial. Steve Bannon pleading not guilty to contempt of Congress charges Both the defense team and prosecutors will discuss confidentiality in the case in the coming week, and are set to be back in court on December 7, when they\u2019ll talk about a trial date again. Delays in the courthouse from the January 6 investigation \u2013 which has an abnormally large number of criminal defendants being prosecuted \u2013 and from the Covid-19 pandemic could still delay a trial date somewhat. Bannon\u2019s team also signaled they want to air details about his standoff with the House in public, while prosecutors are seeking to put confidentiality protections on documents they give to his team. \u201cWe\u2019re just very concerned that there would be the withholding \u2026 or the keeping from public view\u201d documents related to the case, Corcoran said.",

            "article_content": "More than a decade before he was assigned the criminal contempt case brought against Steve Bannon, Judge Carl Nichols was a top Justice Department lawyer deeply involved in pushing sweeping arguments in favor of shielding an ex-presidential adviser from congressional testimony. Nichols \u2013 who was appointed to the bench in 2019 by former President Donald Trump \u2013 will now oversee the Justice Department\u2019s case against Bannon, a former Trump adviser, for Bannon\u2019s alleged noncompliance with the House\u2019s January 6 investigation. Steve Bannon pleading not guilty to contempt of Congress charges Just as notable as the president who put Nichols on the bench is the judge\u2019s experience defending Harriet Miers, who served as White House counsel to President George W. Bush, when lawmakers brought civil litigation against her for her refusal to show up for testimony subpoenaed by the House. Bannon has pleaded not guilty, and if the case goes to trial, it could be a jury that ultimately determines his guilt. But Nichols will be deciding crucial legal and procedural questions that arise before and during an eventual trial. \u201cThat experience \u2013 it gives him a lot of foundation for some of the arguments that Bannon is likely to raise,\u201d said Jonathan Shaub, a University of Kentucky Rosenberg College of Law professor and expert in privilege issues. RELATED: What\u2019s next in the investigation of January 6 The claims the Bush Justice Department made in court \u2013 including in oral arguments presented by Nichols himself, then a principal deputy attorney general \u2013 were rejected in district court and the dispute was eventually settled by the Obama administration before an appeals court could fully weigh in on the merits. Nonetheless, the Miers case featured prominently in the subpoena battles of the Trump administration, which have set the stage for the coming court fights over Congress\u2019 probes into the Capitol riot. Prosecutors will be grappling with legal questions unique to the Bannon case that could complicate the Justice Department\u2019s path to a Bannon conviction. But some of those distinctions may make it easier for Nichols to issue decisions against the Trump ally, legal experts say \u2013 whatever sympathy the judge still has for the arguments he made over a decade ago. \u201cI do think that that if there\u2019s one judge that knows the issue well, it would be Judge Nichols,\u201d said Rick Kaplan, a lawyer who represented the House committee in in the Miers case. \u201cA case like Miers hadn\u2019t come up in many, many years before that, so it was breaking new ground.\u201d Miers was subpoenaed by a Democratic-controlled House in its investigation into the firings of several US attorneys under President George W. Bush. The case was an exceedingly rare occurrence of Congress trying to use civil litigation to enforce compliance with a subpoena of an executive branch official. Miers had already left her role as White House counsel at the time she was subpoenaed, but the Bush administration argued that since the inquiry concerned her work as a close presidential adviser, she was shielded by an absolute immunity that allowed her to avoid even appearing for testimony \u2013 arguments that were echoed by the Trump administration when the House sued Trump\u2019s former White House counsel Don McGahn in 2019 for his refusal to comply with a congressional subpoena. Nichols presented the DOJ\u2019s arguments in the Miers case when it was heard in the district court and when it was before a DC Circuit appeals court panel. What's next in the investigation of January 6 \u201cI think our briefs make clear that the need for immunity is based not just on the need to protect the President\u2019s interest in confidentiality, which can be protected at least in some ways by executive privilege but also the ability to protect the President\u2019s autonomy and how he exercises his constitutional duties and obligations,\u201d Nichols said at a July 2008 district court hearing in the case. The Justice Department \u2013 in briefs signed by Nichols and other top Bush DOJ officials \u2013 argued not just that Miers was constitutionally immune from showing up to testify, but that the judicial branch had no authority to settle the civil lawsuit brought by Congress. (That argument won\u2019t be available to Bannon as he faces a criminal prosecution from the executive branch.) \u201cJudge Nichols, at the time, presented the executive branch\u2019s arguments, which are very aggressive in their in their views on the ability [presidential] advisers to refuse to turn over information,\u201d said Emily Berman, a professor at University of Houston Law Center who had submitted a friend-of-the-court brief in the Miers case on behalf of several public interest organizations. \u201cHe\u2019ll be quite familiar with the issues and hopefully, at least, it will allow him to rule relatively expeditiously on some of these things,\u201d Berman said. \u201cBut I think it is significant that he\u2019s got a history of defending aggressive interpretations of executive privilege.\u201d Trump warns against giving Congress too much power as he seeks to keep his White House records secret The arguments Bannon is now making to justify not participating in the current House probe are even more aggressive than the claims the Bush DOJ made in the Miers case, Berman said. And it\u2019s worth noting that just because a lawyer makes certain arguments on behalf of a client \u2013 which, for Nichols in the Miers dispute, was the US government\u2019s executive branch \u2013 doesn\u2019t mean that the lawyer personally agrees with those arguments, or that he will carry them with him to the bench. In his two-plus years on the bench, Nichols has made several rulings against the interests of the President who appointed him. Nichols shot down the Trump administration\u2019s attempts to ban TikTok and refused to dismiss a defamation lawsuit against Trump allies for their false 2020 election fraud claims. He also rebuffed Trump arguments in a case concerning potential disclosure of his tax returns to Congress. Bannon is facing a criminal prosecution from the Biden administration, which acted on a referral from the House, whereas the Bush Justice Department declined to prosecute Miers, prompting lawmakers to bring a civil lawsuit against her instead. The issues raised by the Miers case and the Bannon case aren\u2019t the same, said Jody Hunt, a former top DOJ lawyer who was involved in the Miers case. \u201cBut I do think the fact that Judge Nichols had handled those other matters gives him an experience that\u2019s helpful in his assessments, because he understands a lot about these issues already,\u201d Hunt said. In the Miers case, the DOJ argued that the court should not get involved in the dispute because criminal contempt \u2013 as well as tools held by lawmakers, like executive branch funding decisions and nominee confirmations \u2013 were the appropriate avenues for pressuring compliance with subpoenas. In the district court arguments, Nichols described the department\u2019s view that \u201cCongress cannot sue the executive branch in federal court seeking information it had subpoenaed from the executive branch in aid of its legislative function.\u201d Nichols also emphasized the 200-year tradition of Congress and the executive branch negotiating accommodations around subpoena compliance, arguing that a court intervention in the dispute would spoil that process. Department lawyers stressed in the case how the Bush administration had accommodated some of the Congress\u2019 information requests before reaching the impasse over Miers\u2019 testimony. Bannon notably did not engage at all in negotiations with lawmakers about cooperating, beyond a letter his attorney sent the House January 6 committee informing lawmakers that he would be following former President Trump\u2019s directive not to participate in their investigation. \u201cI think Bannon has made it easier on DOJ \u2013 and on Nichols in adjudicating this \u2013 by just sort of totally not complying because, privilege: one, it\u2019s qualified. It only applies to certain information. And there\u2019s this tradition of negotiating,\u201d Shaub, who worked for the Justice Department under the Obama administration, told CNN. While Miers, like Bannon, was not a government official when Congress was seeking her testimony, lawmakers\u2019 interest was in events that occurred during her service at the White House. Bannon \u2013 as lawmakers are pointing out now \u2013 was long out of the White House when the Capitol riot and the related events unfolded. But because this is a criminal prosecution, and not a civil matter, there will be hurdles the Justice Department will have to overcome that were not present when the House was seeking to order Miers\u2019 compliance with the US Attorneys probe subpoena. One possible question in the Bannon case is the weight that can be given to a former president\u2019s assertion privilege, as Biden has waived privilege for the purposes of the House\u2019s requests of Bannon, while Trump \u2013 in a separate civil case concerning presidential records \u2013 is claiming his assertion privilege can override Biden\u2019s waiver of it. For Bannon to be found guilty, prosecutors will have to prove \u2013 perhaps ultimately to a jury \u2013 that Bannon had a willful intent to defy Congress\u2019 subpoena. Bannon\u2019s lawyers are likely to argue he had a good faith reasons for not showing up to testify, claiming he was following the former President\u2019s directive and the advice of his attorneys. \u201cWhereas in the Miers litigation, the sort of ambiguity was acceptable and the court is trying to resolve these questions of privilege and immunity,\u201d Shaub said. \u201cHere if there\u2019s ambiguity in the law, it\u2019s going to be construed in favor of Bannon, because he\u2019s a criminal defendant.\u201d",

            "article_content": "It has been over 10 months since rioters stormed the US Capitol on January 6 and the House select committee investigating the attack continues to insist it is making progress, pointing to the fact it has issued 35 subpoenas and interviewed over 200 witnesses so far. But much of that work has taken place behind closed doors and the panel has only offered vague reassurance that its aggressive pursuit of information from a host of witnesses, including close advisers to former President Donald Trump, is producing results. And while the committee has issued 35 subpoenas, it also granted several \u201cshort postponements\u201d making it difficult to assess how many of those individuals have talked to investigators or handed over documents. 'QAnon Shaman' Jacob Chansley sentenced to 41 months in prison for role in US Capitol riot A select committee aide told CNN on Wednesday that some individuals who received subpoenas have complied with the order but declined to provide details about those witnesses or what information they provided. A number of other witnesses have voluntarily engaged with the committee, the aide added. Meanwhile, the committee has been publicly stonewalled by two Trump allies who have emerged as central figures in the probe \u2013 podcast host Steve Bannon and former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows. Their defiance, coupled with the ongoing legal dispute over Trump-era records, has complicated matters for the committee as it faces a ticking clock to deliver on promises to uncover what happened leading up to and on January 6. Rep. Jamie Raskin, a member of the committee, described the probe as three circles of inquiry. The outer ring is focused on the protestors turned rioters \u2013 what led them to Washington and compelled them to become violent. A second ring involves the right wing paramilitary, militia and nationalists groups that were there on January 6, Raskin told CNN, referring to organizations like the Oath Keepers, Proud Boys and Three Percenters. The inner circle looks at those involved in the coordinated attempt to overturn the election results, a group with ties directly to Trump. \u201cHow did how did a demonstration become a riot? How did a violent insurrection get organized, coordinated and paid for? And then who conceived of and attempted to execute the coup against Pence and the Congress? And how were all of these different elements coordinated?\u201d Raskin, a Maryland Democrat, said. To answer those questions, the committee is seeking information from a wide range of witnesses, the committee aide said, \u201cincluding current and former government officials; individuals who helped plan, organize, and pay for events surrounding January 6th; experts and scholars; and the men and women charged with protecting the Capitol in the face of a violent attack.\u201d \u201cSo far, the committee has heard from witnesses from all those categories,\u201d the aide told CNN on Wednesday. CNN has previously reported that the committee is also setting its sights on the financing behind events and people associated with January 6, including money that funded pro-Trump \u201cStop the Steal\u201d rallies that preceded the attack on the Capitol that day, in an effort to determine whether any election law violations or financial crimes took place. It has divided its work into at least five investigative teams, each with their own color designation. The committee is also seeking information from several individuals in former Vice President Mike Pence\u2019s inner circle, a pursuit that underscores its interest in learning more about any pressure related to blocking certification of the election results. Bannon turned himself in to the FBI this week after being indicted on two counts of criminal contempt of Congress for refusing to hand over documents and appear for a deposition with the panel but emerged from court on Monday as defiant as ever. \u201cI\u2019m telling you right now, this is going to be the misdemeanor from hell for Merrick Garland, Nancy Pelosi and Joe Biden,\u201d Bannon told reporters after an initial court hearing, swearing his team is \u201cgoing to go on the offense.\u201d Trump ally Steve Bannon released from custody pending trial on contempt of Congress charges While the select committee has touted Bannon\u2019s indictment as a major victory and said it sends a message to other witnesses who may be inclined to defy their subpoenas, it remains to be seen if the decision will ultimately lead to more cooperation. There are also still questions about whether Bannon will ultimately face legal consequences for defying the committee\u2019s subpoena. Bannon\u2019s attorney told reporters Monday that his client refused to show up for a deposition because he was following the advice of his lawyer at the time \u2013 suggesting they will present that argument in court, where a trial would be months away. Meadows was a no-show for his deposition last week but it remains to be seen if the committee will also ask the Department of Justice to pursue criminal charges against him as well. The chairman of the House select committee, Mississippi Democratic Rep. Bennie Thompson, said he is signing a letter to send to Meadows outlining everything the committee wants to learn from him, as the panel weighs whether to pursue another criminal contempt referral. January 6 committee expected to discuss how to deal with Meadows in Tuesday meeting This letter would be key to marking the trail of communication between Meadows and the committee, and crucial to building out an eventual criminal contempt referral report, if the committee chooses to go that route. A key question that the committee has said it wants answered by Meadows is whether he was using a private cell phone to communicate on January 6 and where his text messages from that day are. Unlike Bannon, Meadows was an employee of the executive branch on January 6, making his claims around executive privilege potentially more substantial. To Thompson, however, if Meadows used a private phone on January 6, his claims of being protected by executive privilege are less firm. \u201cIf in fact he used a personal phone rather than a government phone while he was serving as chief of staff, that limits his argument that he\u2019s protected,\u201d Thompson said. Trump warns against giving Congress too much power as he seeks to keep his White House records secret Ahead of the scheduled deposition last week, Meadows\u2019 attorney, George J. Terwilliger III, issued a statement saying that his client would not cooperate with the committee because the courts had not yet ruled on former President Donald Trump\u2019s claims of executive privilege, noting \u201ca sharp legal dispute with the committee.\u201d If Meadows continues to stonewall the committee, it could result in a court battle where the legal outcome is all but certain but almost certainly closes the door on Trump\u2019s former chief of staff cooperating in any form. Meadows is not the only high priority target not fully cooperating with the committee who members are weighing how to move forward on. Thompson told reporters on Tuesday that the committee is \u201cstill discussing\u201d the next steps on former Department of Justice official Jeffrey Clark, who came in for a deposition earlier this month but did not cooperate. At the time, Thompson and Wyoming Republican Rep. Liz Cheney, the vice chair of the select committee, issued a strong statement saying that Clark had to change course or they\u2019d have to \u201ctake strong measures to hold him accountable.\u201d Thompson said of both Meadows and Clark, \u201cThose are the two prime individuals that we are engaging the committee with.\u201d As the committee continues to deliberate how to proceed on each of these top priority witnesses, Thompson admitted that the calendar presents a logistical challenge. \u201cOur challenge is to get on the legislative calendar,\u201d Thompson said, pointing to major legislation that is taking priority on the floor right now including President Noe Biden\u2019s Build Back Better Act, and after the Thanksgiving break, the deadline next month to fund the government and extend the nation\u2019s debt limit. \u201cSo it\u2019s a matter of finding the space to include it because we have to obviously go to the speaker, get the speaker\u2019s approval, then we have to get rules and ultimately time on the floor,\u201d he added. And with members scheduled to be in town only until Friday before they return to their districts in the lead-up to Thanksgiving, Thompson all but eliminated the possibility of movement on either Meadows or former DOJ official Clark this week given the multi-step process a criminal contempt referral entails. But as looming fights over criminal contempt referrals hang in the balance, Thompson said that he expects the committee to release more subpoenas this week as it continues its investigation, even though he would not specify what orbit these subpoenas would target. And the committee continues its work behind closed doors. Democratic Rep. Zoe Lofgren of California, who serves on the panel, said on CNN on Tuesday night that the committee has now heard from 200 witnesses, received nearly 25,000 documents and gotten more than 200 tips from its tip line. More than 660 individuals have been charged so far and over 130 have already pleaded guilty to various crimes, including assaulting police, destroying government property and conspiracy, many from extremist groups, according to CNN\u2019s latest tally and DOJ. Judge sentences 'QAnon Shaman' Jacob Chansley for role in Capitol riot Those charged come from 44 different states and Washington, DC. Thirty-seven people have been sentenced to date and 15 of those individuals received prison time as a result. Those 37 individuals who have been sentenced were ordered to pay nearly $50,000 to the US government in restitution and fines. CNN\u2019s Marshall Cohen contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Former President Donald Trump\u2019s attorneys are framing his attempt to keep secret records from his presidency as a clash between the executive and legislative branches that could give Congress lopsided power, according to Trump\u2019s argument brief in the major court case related to the House\u2019s January 6 investigation. The court choosing not to stop the House select committee from accessing presidential records \u2013 which the Biden administration supports \u2013 would be \u201cforever changing the dynamics between the political branches,\u201d Trump\u2019s legal team wrote. \u201cIn these hyper- partisan times, Congress will increasingly and inevitably use this new weapon to perpetually harass its political rival.\u201d Some of the records Trump has sought to keep secret include White House visitor records, call logs and notes from his top advisers related to January 6 and his claims that the 2020 presidential election was stolen, according to a sworn declaration from the National Archives. Trump\u2019s filing to the DC Circuit Court of Appeals on Tuesday is the first time he\u2019s framed his argument in the major separation of powers appeal. The former President\u2019s arguments build upon claims he\u2019s already made in court unsuccessfully. In the appeal, Trump says he should have the ability to protect some records from his presidency by claiming executive privilege, and that the House\u2019s reasons for seeking the records aren\u2019t strong enough. A ruling that doesn\u2019t allow former presidents to protect their documents, his legal team adds, \u201cwill have a direct and immediate impact on the advice given to presidents, from President Biden and all those that follow him,\u201d according to the court filing. Trump ally Steve Bannon released from custody pending trial on contempt of Congress charges Trump also seizes upon an idea that the lower court judge, Tanya Chutkan of the DC District Court, raised during a previous round in court, where she dinged the House for the broadness of its requests for information in the January 6 probe. \u201cCongressional power is not limitless, regardless of presidential dictate,\u201d Trump\u2019s team wrote on Tuesday. Trump lost the case at the trial-court level. The appeals court in the DC Circuit will hear arguments later this month on whether Trump as a former president can control records the National Archives is set to give to the House. Chutkan previously ruled against Trump on essentially all of his arguments. She found that his wishes couldn\u2019t overcome the current president\u2019s decision to release the records to the House, noting \u201cpresidents are not kings.\u201d The House and the Biden administration, which represents the Archives, are set to file their responses to Trump\u2019s arguments next week. Three judges from the DC Circuit, Patricia Millett, Robert Wilkins and Ketanji Brown Jackson, who were all appointed by Democratic presidents, will hear oral arguments on November 30. As of now, they have temporarily stopped the National Archives from releasing the Trump-era records. Jackson previously wrote, in a ruling she made against Trump years ago on a separate executive privilege case, that \u201cpresidents are not kings\u201d \u2013 a strong signal that he will have a difficult case to make before the appeals court.",

            "article_content": "The House January 6 investigation hoped to send a fear-inducing message deep into Donald Trump\u2019s inner circle by opening the way to the prosecution of Steve Bannon. But the risks of that strategy became clear on Monday as the ex-President\u2019s political arsonist turned himself in to the FBI after a grand jury had indicted him for contempt of Congress last week. Ever the outsider wrecking ball, Bannon set the example for turning efforts to hold Trump acolytes accountable into fuel for more extremism. The former Wall Street banker turned firebrand populist podcaster relished his moment in the spotlight, embracing victimhood in the name of Trumpism just like political dirty tricks master and Trump fan Roger Stone. He vowed to topple the Biden \u201cregime\u201d and to make the charges against him a \u201cmisdemeanor from Hell\u201d for the President, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Attorney General Merrick Garland, who signed off on his prosecution. \u201cI am never going to back down. They took on the wrong guy this time,\u201d Bannon said, launching what is effectively a political campaign that will unfold alongside what could be a long legal fight, which could even outlast the committee\u2019s lifespan if Republicans win control of the House next November and shut down the probe. January 6 committee expected to discuss how to deal with Meadows in Tuesday meeting The questions now are whether Bannon\u2019s coming date in court this week for an arraignment will wipe out some of his bravado, and persuade other Trump ex-officials not to risk the law\u2019s ire and to agree to testify. Or will his unleashing of a new Trumpian cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre convince other subpoenaed allies of the former President \u2013 like ex-White House chief of staff Mark Meadows \u2013 to stand firm on questionable assertions of executive privilege? And will Bannon\u2019s line in the sand, which runs parallel to Trump\u2019s emerging political comeback and possible 2024 White House bid, set a standard that anyone who wants to remain in the ex-President\u2019s orbit must match despite personal legal jeopardy? Sources told CNN that the committee will consider the case of Meadows on Tuesday, though is yet to come to a consensus on whether he will face a criminal contempt of Congress citation like the one that precipitated the Justice Department move against Bannon. The committee wants to speak to Bannon about his alleged role in a \u201cwar room\u201d in the Willard Hotel in Washington, DC, where he reportedly boosted Trump\u2019s campaign to steal the election from Biden, and about preparations for the January 6 rally that turned into a riot. Bannon is claiming his consultations with Trump are covered by executive privilege. But the concept that allows presidents to get confidential advice from advisers seems a stretch in this case since Bannon was not a serving White House official at the time and left the government in 2017. Bannon\u2019s choice of language was no mistake. His use of the word \u201cregime\u201d to describe Biden\u2019s government is another example of the authoritarian streak that the ex-President\u2019s acolytes hope to ride back to power. Of course, Biden was democratically elected and his victory reflected the will of 81 million voters who rejected the idea of a second Trump term. If any operation is acting like a \u201cregime\u201d \u2013 a word usually associated with tyrannical juntas and illegitimate governments that seize power by force \u2013 it is Trump\u2019s. After all, he incited the Capitol insurrection by his mob on January 6. Bannon\u2019s media histrionics on Monday, which were aimed at Trump supporters and devotees of his inflammatory podcast that pulsates with lies about the 2020 election, also underscored another difficulty of holding the ex-President or his wider circle to account. When one side is trying to preserve the rule of law by conventional means and the other is whipping up as much chaos as possible, the instruments of accountability themselves become tarnished. In many ways, the unchained behavior of Trump and his allies left those who want to defend democracy from his transgressions little choice but to pull institutional levers of law and justice. But such action brings a heavy cost when Trump and Bannon \u2013 whose methods revolve around tearing down truth and institutions and seeing where the wreckage falls \u2013 are involved. A running list of who has received a subpoena from the House January 6 select committee Trump\u2019s two impeachments, for example, didn\u2019t result in his conviction for abusing power in trying to get Ukraine to interfere in the election or over the coup he incited in a bid to stay in office. His iron rule over GOP senators saw to it that he was acquitted in both instances. But those impeachments did deepen political divides and stoke the anger on which his appeal to his base thrives. The two historic battles between Congress and Trump also so politicized the machinery of government and democracy that they lost trust among millions of Trump supporters. Those traditional methods of holding aberrant presidents to account may therefore not function effectively in the future. When there is a powerful force like Trump, who cares little for the rule of law or history\u2019s shame with a double impeachment, the consequent latitude for out-of-bounds political behavior is limitless. Perhaps, eventually, Bannon will pay the price for defying the House select committee with jail time. But the political rewards for him could outweigh such sanctions and discomfort. And if his sacrifice is followed by a Trump restoration, Bannon could probably expect a pardon to match the one Trump already granted him in a fraud case. His legal fight could give him a media spotlight for months that far outshines his normal role on the conservative airwaves, where he has become an increasingly influential voice among Trump partisans. The case could be a long and winding road, with possible delays, multiple filings and appeals and complicated debates on the question of executive privilege. There also may be a few wild card moments. The assigned judge, Carl Nichols, is a Trump appointee who has a history as a lawyer of defending the Bush administration in disputes over congressional subpoenas, CNN\u2019s Evan Perez reported. But judges also often balk at their courtrooms being turned into circuses. A judge in a case involving Stone that arose out of the Mueller investigation, for instance, imposed a gag order when the veteran Richard Nixon-era operative-turned-Trump-confidant tried to turn it into a political media spectacle. The possibility that Bannon would use his indictment as yet another political platform, after spending years claiming a deep state conspiracy by the establishment to destroy Trump\u2019s populist rule, was always obvious. But one of the committee\u2019s most prominent members, Rep. Adam Schiff, who led Democrats in the first Senate impeachment trial, said on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d on Sunday that he believed the Bannon indictment was already effective. \u201cEven before the Justice Department acted, it influenced other witnesses who were not going to be Steve Bannon. And now that witnesses see that if they don\u2019t cooperate, if they don\u2019t fulfill their lawful duty when subpoenaed, that they too may be prosecuted, it will have a very strong focusing effect on their decision making.\u201d But Schiff also admitted there\u2019s a risk that witnesses who portray themselves as political martyrs to the ex-President\u2019s \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d crowd could take inspiration from Bannon\u2019s defiance. Trump is in full attack mode as Biden celebrates a victory that eluded him \u201cI\u2019m concerned, frankly, of what that represents, basically that the Republican Party, at the top levels, that is Donald Trump and those around him, seem to feel that they\u2019re above the law and free to thwart it,\u201d he said. \u201cBannon did what he did because for four years, that\u2019s what worked. They could hold Republican Party conventions on the White House grounds. They could fire inspector generals, they could retaliate against whistleblowers. It was essentially a lawless presidency and they were proud of it.\u201d The House select committee has so far issued 35 subpoenas to individuals and organizations seeking testimony and documents. Trump is currently appealing a federal court ruling that knocked down his attempt to assert executive privilege over call logs, White House visitor logs, memos and other material. Members of the committee argue that law and precedent mean the final say on privilege issues lies not with the former President but the current one. Biden has said the events of January 6 were so heinous that Congress\u2019 obligation to investigate outweighed any jeopardy that ex-Presidents might face in future. The committee\u2019s next move on Meadows will be watched carefully. Though a staunch Trump loyalist, the former North Carolina congressman is less of a partisan flame thrower than Bannon. But as a serving White House official at the time of the insurrection, he may have a stronger executive privilege case than the celebrity podcaster. Sources told CNN\u2019s Ryan Nobles and Annie Grayer on Monday that the committee had yet to come to a consensus on how to move against the former White House chief of staff. While Meadows didn\u2019t show for a required appearance before the committee on Friday, he did make it for a Fox Business Network interview on Monday with anchor Larry Kudlow, a fellow former Trump White House official, about the events on January 6. \u201cI can tell you, you and I both know that no one in the West Wing had any knowledge that anything like what happened on January 6 was going to happen,\u201d Meadows said. It\u2019s once thing to make such a comment on FBN, but Meadows has so far been unwilling to repeat it under oath to the select committee. It is that inconsistency and spirit of defiance that motivated the panel\u2019s duel with Bannon and could soon land the ex-chief of staff in similar trouble.",

            "article_content": "Donald Trump is tightening his malignant hold on American politics as Joe Biden battles to stabilize his own problem-plagued presidency by celebrating his massive infrastructure reform package \u2013 a political win his predecessor never managed. The corrosive and complicated impact of the 45th President\u2019s poisoned legacy again threatens to blot out Biden\u2019s efforts to look to the future on Monday, as Trump\u2019s political guru Steve Bannon turned himself in at the FBI\u2019s Washington field office after a federal grand jury indicted him last week for ignoring a subpoena from the House probe into Trump\u2019s coup attempt. In remarks to camera, he told his supporters to stay focused, adding: \u201cWe\u2019re taking down the Biden regime every day.\u201d In an earlier indication of the Trump team\u2019s willingness to embrace authoritarian rhetoric in open defiance of a democratic choice made by voters, Trump appeared to defend rioters, some who chanted \u201cHang Mike Pence,\u201d after his vice president refused to throw the election. The comment was contained in audio of an interview conducted for a new book by Jonathan Karl released by ABC News. Trump, as he relentlessly solidifies plans for a likely 2024 presidential run, is meanwhile stepping up efforts to increase his dominance over the Republican Party, vowing to oust lawmakers who backed Biden\u2019s bipartisan $1 trillion bipartisan infrastructure package. The current President will hold a high wattage signing ceremony for the measure at the White House on Monday, which will include at least two Republican senators who will show up in defiance of Trump. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, an incessant target of the ex-President, who also voted for the bill, will not, however, take part in Biden\u2019s victory lap. The event will be a reminder that Trump\u2019s own inept attempts to pass such infrastructure reform turned into an object of ridicule. If ever a President needed a win, it was Biden, who endured a tough summer. As he signs the measure he hopes will offer a jolt of momentum to his presidency, the President will put Mitch Landrieu, the former Democratic mayor of New Orleans, in charge of implementing the vast new law. But it is unlikely that a rare bipartisan spending program, necessary to fix US roads, railroads, bridges and airports, will be a magic fix for a presidency in turmoil.   Biden, whose approval rating tumbled to 41% in a new Washington Post/ABC News poll on Sunday, is facing accusations that he is not sufficiently focused on the issues that Americans most care about. A CNN/SSRS poll released last week found that 58% of Americans believed that Biden hadn\u2019t paid attention to the nation\u2019s most important problems. More than a third of respondents thought the economy was the most pressing issue. An alarming spike in inflation and high gasoline prices are creating the kind of perfect economic storm that everyone in the country feels and that shapes political discontent. While elements of the infrastructure plan and the companion yet-to-pass social spending blueprint are popular, could create jobs and ease the burden on working Americans, they will take many months and years to play out. The high cost of living, brought on mostly by the pandemic and related supply chain issues, is giving Republicans a massive opening now as midterm elections loom in a year. With costs for Thanksgiving turkeys and travel rising because of supply chain backups and high energy prices, legislative wins will do little in the short term to ease Biden\u2019s plight. The White House may also have another political brushfire to put out this week following a CNN story that revealed mutual frustration between the West Wing and Vice President Kamala Harris about her performance so far in the administration. In many ways, Trump and Biden are continuing the battle that the ex-President lost in the 2020 election. The obstruction by Trump and his allies of the January 6 committee represents an expansion of the assault on democracy that was born when he could not accept the truth of his defeat a year ago. Trump and his volcanic ego are now trying to turn the 2022 midterm elections \u2013 and potentially the 2024 elections \u2013 into a referendum on his lies that the last presidential election was stolen, a narrative that millions of GOP voters already accept. It also helps explain why he and his allies are trying so hard to cover up the truth of an attempt to derail democracy. While Trump\u2019s challenge to the rule of law is bedded into his political project, Biden\u2019s infrastructure bill is also deeply rooted in the DNA of his presidency. He intends the bipartisan bill to prove that Americans can achieve great things when they are united and not ripped apart by demagogues like Trump. His use of government to create jobs and improve the lives of working Americans also has another purpose. The infrastructure bill and the spending bill, which still faces an uncertain fate amid intraparty clashes on Capitol Hill, are meant to show that democracy works and to drain the populist pool of resentment that is so often inflamed by Trump. Bannon's indictment may mark a turning point News that the architect of that populist movement had been indicted by a federal grand jury on Friday was a significant development in the showdown between Trump and the House select committee investigating the insurrection he incited on January 6. Bannon, a former White House official and rabble rousing podcaster, allegedly played an important behind-the-scenes role in a \u201cwar room\u201d dedicated to Trump\u2019s bid to steal the election by disrupting the peaceful transfer of power to Biden. His claim that his conversations with Trump are protected by executive privilege appears to hold little legal merit since he was not even serving as an official at the time of the insurrection. And the committee wants to discuss his conversations with other Trump supporters that do not involve the former President. If convicted, Bannon, 67, could face a maximum of one year in jail and a fine of up to $1,000 on each of the two counts against him. The decision by the Justice Department to move ahead with the case followed a formal citation of contempt of Congress approved by the House. The indictment made an important statement for now and in the future about Congress\u2019 ability to enforce subpoenas in vital investigations. But it is likely to be borne as a badge of honor by Bannon and to fuel claims that once again a deep state political establishment is trying to persecute Trump \u2013 a narrative that is core to the ex-President\u2019s appeal among many grassroots supporters. The Bannon indictment may be a sign that the House select committee, in a race against time in case the GOP wins back the chamber next year and closes it down, is ready to take a hard line against witnesses that refuse to testify. This includes former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, who didn\u2019t show on Friday. \u201cWhen ultimately witnesses decide, as Meadows has, that they\u2019re not even going to bother showing up, that they have that much contempt for the law, then it pretty much forces our hand, and we\u2019ll move quickly,\u201d Democratic committee member Rep. Adam Schiff of California said on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d One of the 10 House Republicans who voted to impeach Trump over the insurrection, Rep. Anthony Gonzalez of Ohio, issued an extraordinary warning on Sunday over Trump\u2019s hold on his party and influence. \u201cThe cold hard truth is Donald Trump led us into a ditch on January 6. The former President lied to us. He lied to every one of us and in doing so he cost (Republicans) the House, the Senate and the White House,\u201d Gonzalez told Jake Tapper on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union.\u201d \u201cI see, fundamentally, a person who shouldn\u2019t be able to hold office again because of what he did around January 6. But I also see somebody who\u2019s an enormous political loser. And I don\u2019t know why anybody who wants to win elections going forward would follow that. I simply, like, I don\u2019t get it ethically. I certainly don\u2019t get it politically. Neither of them makes sense.\u201d Trump has already targeted members like Gonzalez over their impeachment votes, backing a primary challenger to the Ohio congressman, who has since said he won\u2019t run for reelection. But now the ex-President is targeting the 13 Republicans in the House and 19 in the Senate who voted for the infrastructure bill, furious that they enabled a victory for the current President on an issue on which Trump so obviously failed to make progress. \u201cSaving America starts by saving the GOP from RINOs, sellouts and known losers!\u201d Trump wrote in one of many enraged and lie-filled weekend statements. This one called on pro-Trump forces to stage primary campaigns against lawmakers that supported the infrastructure bill, as the ex-President tries to transform his party in his own anti-democratic image. Trump\u2019s power in the party and the impact of his maneuvering against Republicans who cross him was epitomized yet again on Sunday by the failure of a powerful Republican senator to repudiate his insurrectionist rhetoric. Wyoming Sen. John Barrasso was asked repeatedly on ABC News \u201cThis Week\u201d about Trump\u2019s failure to stand with his then-vice president, who refused to bow to his pressure to steal the election from Biden while following constitutional requirements to certify the result of the election in January. \u201cPresident Trump brings lots of energy to the party. He\u2019s an enduring force,\u201d Barrasso said. \u201cI don\u2019t agree with President Trump on everything,\u201d he added. \u201cI agree with him on the policies that have brought the best economy of my lifetime and I\u2019m going to continue to support those policies.\u201d However extreme Trump becomes, the essential Republican position \u2013 appeasing him to win power \u2013 remains the same.",

            "article_content": "Former Trump White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows did not appear for a deposition on Friday in front of the House select committee investigating January 6, sources familiar with the investigation tell CNN, setting up a potential showdown that could lead to the panel beginning a criminal referral process against him. Committee staffers had been prepared to go forward with the interview and waited in a room on Capitol Hill with a stenographer, but started to file out of the room nine minutes after the deadline passed. Committee Chairman Bennie Thompson, a Mississippi Democrat, and Vice Chairwoman Liz Cheney, a Wyoming Republican, said in a statement on Friday that Meadows\u2019 actions force the panel to consider criminal contempt of Congress, but they stopped short of saying that is the path they will officially pursue. \u201cMr. Meadows\u2019s actions today \u2013 choosing to defy the law \u2013 will force the Select Committee to consider pursuing contempt or other proceedings to enforce the subpoena. If his defiance persists and that process moves ahead, the record will reveal the wide range of matters the Select Committee wished to discuss with Mr. Meadows until his decision to hide behind the former President\u2019s spurious claims of privilege,\u201d the pair said in a statement. The absurd logic of Trump's bid to defy the January 6 committee \u201cIt\u2019s unfortunate that Mr. Meadows has chosen to join a very small group of witnesses who believe they are above the law and are defying a Select Committee subpoena outright.\u201d Meadows\u2019 attorney did not respond to a request for comment after the scheduled deposition. Ahead of the scheduled deposition Friday morning, Meadows\u2019 attorney, George J. Terwilliger III, issued a statement saying his client would not cooperate with the committee until courts ruled on former President Donald Trump\u2019s claims of executive privilege, noting \u201ca sharp legal dispute with the committee.\u201d \u201cThe issues concern whether Mr. Meadows can be compelled to testify and whether, even if he could, that he could be forced to answer questions that involve privileged communications,\u201d Terwilliger said. \u201cLegal disputes are appropriately resolved by courts. It would be irresponsible for Mr. Meadows to prematurely resolve that dispute by voluntarily waiving privileges that are at the heart of those legal issues.\u201d Terwilliger added, \u201cNo matter how important the subject matter of the committee\u2019s work, decades of litigation over Executive Privilege shows how critically important it is for a president to have access to advice and counsel without fear that political opponents in Congress will later be able to pull away the shield of confidentiality that protects candor in those communications.\u201d In their statement, Thompson and Cheney rejected the argument that Meadows can claim executive privilege. \u201cIt\u2019s important to note that there\u2019s nothing extraordinary about the Select Committee seeking the cooperation of a former senior administration official,\u201d they said. \u201cThroughout U.S. history, the White House has provided Congress with testimony and information when it has been in the public interest. There couldn\u2019t be a more compelling public interest than getting answers about an attack on our democracy.\u201d Among the questions the panel wants answered from Meadows is whether he was using a private cell phone to communicate on January 6 and where his text messages from that day are. By officially setting a deadline that Meadows did not meet, the committee took an official step toward possibly referring Meadows to the Department of Justice for contempt of Congress. It's been a huge week for the January 6 investigation Thompson scheduled the Friday deposition late Thursday evening in an effort to force Meadows\u2019 compliance. \u201cThe Select Committee will view Mr. Meadows\u2019s failure to appear at the deposition, and to produce responsive documents or a privilege log indicating the specific basis for withholding any documents you believe are protected by privilege, as willful non-compliance,\u201d Thompson wrote on Thursday ahead of the scheduled deposition. Thompson continued, \u201cSuch willful noncompliance with the subpoena would force the Select Committee to consider invoking the contempt of Congress procedures \u2026 which could result in a referral from the House of Representatives to the Department of Justice for criminal charges \u2013 as well as the possibility of having a civil action to enforce the subpoena brought against Mr. Meadows in his personal capacity.\u201d Earlier Thursday, White House Deputy Counsel Jonathan Su wrote to Meadows\u2019 attorney,  informing him of Biden\u2019s decision and once again citing \u201cthe unique and extraordinary circumstances where Congress is investigating an effort to obstruct the lawful transfer of power under our Constitution.\u201d Su noted to Terwilliger that Biden has already determined that executive privilege does not apply to particular subjects within the committee\u2019s purview, including \u201cevents within the White House on or about January 6, 2021; attempts to use the Department of Justice to advance a false narrative that the 2020 election was tainted by widespread fraud; and other efforts to alter election results or obstruct the transfer of power.\u201d The Washington Post first reported Su\u2019s letter. Meadows was subpoenaed in September, and since then the committee has indicated he\u2019s been \u201cengaging\u201d in negotiations over the terms of his turning over documents and appearing for a deposition. But weeks after the committee granted Meadows a \u201cshort\u201d but indefinite postponement of the initial subpoena deadline, members are growing increasingly frustrated and have been contemplating when and how to ramp up the pressure. The committee is setting up to follow a similar path it pursued with Trump ally Steve Bannon. Federal grand jury indicts former Trump adviser Steve Bannon for contempt of Congress The Justice Department announced Friday that a federal grand jury had returned an indictment against Bannon for contempt of Congress after he defied his subpoena from the committee. \u201cWhile we\u2019re determined to get all the information we\u2019re seeking, Mr. Meadows, Mr. Bannon, and others who go down this path won\u2019t prevail in stopping the Select Committee\u2019s effort getting answers for the American people about January 6th, making legislative recommendations to help protect our democracy, and helping ensure nothing like that day ever happens again,\u201d Thompson and Cheney said. Asked if the Bannon development affects the committee\u2019s thought process on how to move forward with Meadows, Rep. Jamie Raskin, who serves on the panel, said members on the committee view each case separately, but that each individual subpoenaed is held to the same standard of the rule of law. \u201cI\u2019m certain there will be little patience for anyone who is just blowing off congressional subpoenas,\u201d the Maryland Democrat told CNN, acknowledging that members are not in town this week and will have to wait until next week to officially meet. \u201cWe have been moving promptly to respond to defiance to any House subpoenas.\u201d Rep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois, one of two Republicans on the House panel, told CNN that he hopes the indictment against Bannon \u201csends a chilling message\u201d to anyone considering not cooperating with the committee. \u201cThis is certainly a good thing, and I hope it sends a chilling message to anybody else that was going to follow through like this,\u201d he said. The lack of cooperation from Meadows and the federal indictment of Bannon comes after the committee has said they have interviewed 150 individuals who are \u201cengaging and cooperating\u201d with its investigation. The committee has issued 35 subpoenas to date, including to former White House officials, Trump campaign officials and organizers of the rallies and events leading up to the January 6 attack. On Tuesday, the committee also subpoenaed two former White House officials who worked closely with Meadows to learn more about his efforts to communicate with others relevant to the probe \u2013 including election officials in Georgia, organizers of January 6 events and high-level officials at the Department of Justice. This story has been updated with additional developments Friday. CNN\u2019s Shawna Mizelle contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Ex-President Donald Trump is planting his flag on a logical absurdity in his transparent bid to run out the clock on the January 6 investigation and avoid accountability for his unprecedented bid to steal power in a coup. A President who refused to accept the result of a free and fair election and who incited a mob that invaded the US Capitol is arguing that he is acting to protect the republic, the presidency and constitutional norms. That argument is hard to read with a straight face. His goal is to delay the House select committee\u2019s investigation and keep his West Wing documents secret as long as possible, at least until after the midterm elections when a Republican House majority could shut down the probe. And on that front, he got a short-term victory on Thursday when a panel of appeals court judges granted him a last-minute reprieve to stop the committee from obtaining his White House documents as scheduled on Friday. The move was to allow time for Trump\u2019s appeal to a scathing ruling from a lower court judge earlier this week that comprehensively rejected his claim to shield memos, diary entries, and call and visitor logs with executive privilege. But in their Thursday memo, the three judges \u2013 all appointed by Democrats \u2013 wrote that it \u201cshould not be construed in any way as a ruling on the merits.\u201d What's next in Trump's scramble to stop the House from getting his White House docs Trump\u2019s argument that he is trying to defend the presidency may possess a certain legal coherence within the confines of a case he is making that his discussions around January 6 should remain confidential through a doctrine known as executive privilege, which protects presidential deliberations. But in the real world, the claim that he\u2019s acting to protect future occupants of the Oval Office is undermined by his wrecking ball presidency that stretched the Constitution to its limits. It\u2019s the kind of leap of credulity and subversion of truth that defined Trump\u2019s presidency and is consistent with a lifetime approach of using the law to avoid answering the consequences of his own actions rather than pursuing justice. And as so often before, Trump ends up accusing those who try to hold him to account of being guilty of the exact transgression of which he is accused \u2013 in this case eviscerating presidential norms. Trump\u2019s argument would also require outsiders to draw the conclusion that a man who spent four years ignoring the Constitution, defying scrutiny by Congress and stretching the powers of his office suddenly cares for American democracy. Even when out of office, his tactics and behavior are being replicated by some of his most loyal former aides. An attorney for former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, for example, said on Thursday his client would not cooperate with the January 6 committee until the courts rule on Trump\u2019s executive privilege claim. The former North Carolina congressman is claiming his dealings with Trump are shielded by executive privilege. But select committee Chairman Bennie Thompson demanded Meadows show up before the committee on Friday or else risk a criminal contempt referral \u2013 a move the panel already took against Trump political adviser Steve Bannon. Supreme Court precedent suggests that while ex-presidents may have some expectation of executive privilege in some circumstances, the ultimate decision on the matter rests with the sitting president and not the former one. President Joe Biden has already decided not to support Trump\u2019s claims given the extraordinary nature of what took place on January 6, and Meadows was notified Thursday that Biden will not assert executive privilege or immunity over documents and testimony requested by the panel. It's been a huge week for the January 6 investigation In their filing to the US Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit for the injunction, Trump\u2019s legal team said that the case raised \u201cweighty and rarely litigated constitutional issues that could have a profound effect on the executive branch.\u201d They added that \u201can injunction, so that the court can judiciously consider this dispute, is in the public\u2019s and this Republic\u2019s best interest.\u201d It\u2019s true that the question of where executive privilege resides carries implications for the future. But again, the argument that Trump is purely acting altruistically to clear up a constitutional point of dispute is hard to take seriously. It has long been clear that Trump and acolytes like Bannon want to delay the committee\u2019s work until the midterms. Such a scenario would mean that while many of Trump\u2019s supporters who smashed their way into the Capitol are now beginning to face justice, the ultimate orchestrator of the chaos, Trump, would escape a formal accounting for the worst attack on American democracy of the modern era \u2013 all while he cranks up what looks like a certain 2024 presidential campaign. The arguments from Meadows, who has so far refused to comply with a subpoena from the committee, echo those from the Trump lawyers. The former White House chief of staff is making clear he will not cooperate until told by a court that he must do so. In essence, Meadows is arguing that Biden, by not protecting Trump documents and aides, is the president who is crushing norms rather than his former boss, who tried multiple times to steal the election. Meadows\u2019 lawyer, George Terwilliger, told CNN in a statement that \u201ccontrary to decades of consistent bipartisan opinions from the Justice Department that senior aides cannot be compelled by Congress to give testimony, this is the first President to make no effort whatsoever to protect presidential communications from being the subject of compelled testimony.\u201d A running list of who has received a subpoena from the House January 6 select committee But a White House official pushed back on the Meadows gambit on Thursday, saying it was factually and legally wrong. \u201cMark Meadows hardly has claim to complain about norms and traditions \u2013 Meadows participated in an effort to subvert the Constitution and overturn a presidential election, including by pressuring state elections officials to alter election results and by personally attempting to coerce the Department of Justice into investigating absurd conspiracy theories,\u201d the official said. In a preview of the Meadows line of argument, Trump spokesman Taylor Budowich said earlier this week that the ex-President would continue to fight for the integrity of the presidency in perpetuity. \u201cThe battle to defend Executive Privilege for Presidents past, present & future\u2014from its outset\u2014was destined to be decided by the Appellate Courts,\u201d Budowich wrote. \u201cPres. Trump remains committed to defending the Constitution & the Office of the Presidency, & will be seeing this process through.\u201d The appeals court has set oral arguments in the Trump case for November 30, meaning that a handover of documents from the National Archives to the committee likely will not take place until early December \u2013 if Trump loses, as many legal experts believe that he will. Even then, the ex-President is almost certain to appeal the case right up to the Supreme Court. The new delay for the committee comes as it waits for Attorney General Merrick Garland and the DC US attorneys office to decide whether to prosecute Bannon on the basis of the criminal contempt of Congress charge. But Rep. Adam Kinzinger, one of just two Republicans on the select committee, said Thursday that he was not concerned that the new delay would seriously imperil the work of the investigation. \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s a huge setback. Obviously Trump\u2019s folks will spin this as a win because there\u2019s a lack of wins, frankly on any of their legal side,\u201d Kinzinger told CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer. \u201cOf course, we wish we\u2019d have gotten these documents tomorrow, but this doesn\u2019t come as any surprise, it\u2019s not going to slow down our investigation and I expect that, keeping the Supreme Court potentially aside, we will have these documents fairly soon.\u201d Supreme Court's Watergate-era rulings against Nixon may end Trump's executive privilege claims In a fresh sign of the committee\u2019s growing impatience with Meadows, however, after protracted conversations with the former chief of staff\u2019s representatives, Thompson issued a strongly worded statement demanding his attendance on Friday. \u201cSimply put, there is no valid legal basis for Mr. Meadows\u2019s continued resistance to the Select Committee\u2019s subpoena. As such, the Select Committee expects Mr. Meadows to produce documents and appear for deposition testimony tomorrow, November 12, 2021, at 10:00 a.m,\u201d the Mississippi Democrat said. \u201cIf there are specific questions during that deposition that you believe raise legitimate privilege issues, Mr. Meadows should state them at that time on the record for the Select Committee\u2019s consideration and possible judicial review,\u201d Thompson wrote. The chairman warned that \u201cwillful noncompliance with the subpoena would force the Select Committee to consider invoking the contempt of Congress\u2026 which could result in a referral from the House of Representatives to the Department of Justice for criminal charges.\u201d Meadows, however, has already indicated that he has no intention of helping the committee until he thinks his legal options have run out, a position consistent with everything America already knows about the behavior of the previous administration.",

            "article_content": "The House select committee investigating January 6 is demanding former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows appear for a deposition and turn over documents Friday or risk a criminal contempt referral, according to a letter Thursday from panel Chairman Bennie Thompson. Meadows has been facing new pressure to cooperate with the committee after he was notified earlier Thursday that President Joe Biden will not assert executive privilege or immunity over documents and testimony requested by the panel, according to a copy obtained by CNN. The move to set a final compliance date for Meadows comes after his attorney issued a statement Thursday saying he would not cooperate with the committee until courts ruled on former President Donald Trump\u2019s claim of executive privilege. The committee on Thursday took its first step toward possibly referring Meadows to the Department of Justice for contempt of Congress if he fails to comply with Friday\u2019s deadline. \u201cThe Select Committee will view Mr. Meadows\u2019s failure to appear at the deposition, and to produce responsive documents or a privilege log indicating the specific basis for withholding any documents you believe are protected by privilege, as willful non-compliance,\u201d Thompson, a Mississippi Democrat, wrote. \u201cSuch willful noncompliance with the subpoena would force the Select Committee to consider invoking the contempt of Congress procedures in 2 U.S.C. \u00a7\u00a7 192, 194\u2014which could result in a referral from the House of Representatives to the Department of Justice for criminal charges\u2014as well as the possibility of having a civil action to enforce the subpoena brought against Mr. Meadows in his personal capacity.\u201d Democrat-appointed appellate panel pauses release of Trump White House records ahead of Friday deadline Earlier Thursday, White House Deputy Counsel Jonathan Su wrote to Meadows\u2019 attorney, George Terwilliger, informing him of Biden\u2019s decision and once again citing \u201cthe unique and extraordinary circumstances where Congress is investigating an effort to obstruct the lawful transfer of power under our Constitution.\u201d Su notes that Biden has already determined that executive privilege does not apply to particular subjects within the committee\u2019s purview, including \u201cevents within the White House on or about January 6, 2021; attempts to use the Department of Justice to advance a false narrative that the 2020 election was tainted by widespread fraud; and other efforts to alter election results or obstruct the transfer of power.\u201d The Washington Post first reported Su\u2019s letter. \u201cContrary to decades of consistent bipartisan opinions from the Justice Department that senior aides cannot be compelled by Congress to give testimony, this is the first President to make no effort whatsoever to protect presidential communications from being the subject of compelled testimony. Mr. Meadows remains under the instructions of former President Trump to respect longstanding principles of executive privilege. It now appears the courts will have to resolve this conflict,\u201d Terwilliger told CNN in a statement. Su\u2019s letter came after CNN previously reported that members of the House select committee are losing patience with the pace of talks with Meadows, and some are considering whether more aggressive steps are needed to force his compliance in the sweeping probe. Supreme Court's Watergate-era rulings against Nixon may end Trump's executive privilege claims Also Thursday, a White House official pushed back forcefully against Terwilliger\u2019s claims, telling CNN he is \u201cwrong on both the facts and the law.\u201d \u201cMark Meadows hardly has claim to complain about norms and traditions \u2013 Meadows participated in an effort to subvert the Constitution and overturn a presidential election, including by pressuring state elections officials to alter election results and by personally attempting to coerce the Department of Justice into investigating absurd conspiracy theories,\u201d the official said.

            "article_content": "A federal appeals court on Thursday granted former President Donald Trump\u2019s request to pause the release of key White House records from his presidency to the House select committee investigating the January 6 attack on the US Capitol, as he appeals a lower court\u2019s decision that he can\u2019t claim executive privilege to keep them secret. Three judges for the US Court of Appeals for the DC Circuit, all of whom were appointed by Democrats, issued the temporary injunction in response to Trump\u2019s last-ditch effort ahead of a Friday deadline to turn over an initial batch of 46 records, including White House call logs, visitor logs, drafts of speeches and three handwritten memos from Trump\u2019s then-chief of staff, Mark Meadows. Judges Patricia Millett and Robert Wilkins, both Obama appointees, and Ketanji Brown Jackson, a Biden appointee, sit on the appellate panel considering Trump\u2019s request. Jackson, perhaps most known for her 2019 opinion ruling that former Trump White House counsel Don McGahn must comply with a congressional subpoena concerning Russia\u2019s interference in the 2016 presidential election, is considered a top pick for the Supreme Court should there be an opening during President Joe Biden\u2019s term. The three-judge panel asked lawyers for Trump, Congress and the Biden administration to submit briefs before oral arguments are heard on November 30. Supreme Court's Watergate-era rulings against Nixon may end Trump's executive privilege claims \u201cThe purpose of this administrative injunction is to protect the court\u2019s jurisdiction to address appellant\u2019s claims of executive privilege and should not be construed in any way as a ruling on the merits,\u201d the panel wrote in a two-page order. In total, more than 700 documents from Trump\u2019s presidency had been expected to be turned over by the National Archives to the committee in the coming weeks. Judge Tanya Chutkan twice rejected Trump\u2019s bid for a preliminary injunction to prevent the National Archives from complying with document request, noting in a Wednesday night ruling that Trump\u2019s attorneys did not put forward new legal arguments or new facts to alter her previous ruling that held executive privilege belongs to the office \u2013 not the individual. \u201cIn this appeal, the Court will consider novel and important constitutional issues of first impression concerning separation of powers, presidential records, and executive privilege,\u201d Trump\u2019s attorneys wrote Thursday. In a ruling Tuesday, Chutkan wrote, \u201cPresidents are not kings, and Plaintiff is not President.\u201d The former President filed a lawsuit last month in DC District Court, claiming executive privilege and alleging that the House\u2019s requests for documents are \u201cunprecedented in their breadth and scope\u201d and illegitimate. The Biden White House has declined to intervene to block access to the Trump records. The Biden administration has said in a filing to Chutkan that Trump, as the former President, \u201chas no personal interest in the records,\u201d and that the Biden White House\u2019s decision to allow these presidential records to go to Congress should stand. On Wednesday, the House committee wrote that it needs the Trump White House records quickly so it can continue investigating the attack on Congress. \u201cThe potential harm to the public is immense: Our democratic institutions and a core feature of our democracy \u2014 the peaceful transfer of power \u2014 are at stake,\u201d the committee wrote. It added that a delay will hinder its ability to \u201ctimely complete a comprehensive investigation and recommend effective remedial legislation.\u201d This story has been updated with additional developments Thursday.

            "article_content": "A version of this story appeared in CNN\u2019s What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here. The House select committee investigating the January 6 insurrection appears to be ramping up. Its court battle to get documents from former President Donald Trump\u2019s administration is intensifying, and it is homing in on aides of former Vice President Mike Pence, who was a target of the insurrectionists. The committee\u2019s focus points have dripped out over the course of months. Key lines of inquiry appear to include: Exclusive reporting from CNN\u2019s Jamie Gangel, Zachary Cohen and Michael Warren on Wednesday indicates the committee is now zeroing in on individuals close to Pence. This is in light of Trump\u2019s unsuccessful efforts to force Pence to steal the election and the physical threat the riot posed to Pence and his family. Will Pence aides talk? According to the report, they \u201cmay be willing, either voluntarily or under the guise of a \u2018friendly subpoena,\u2019 to provide critical information on how Trump and his allies tried to pressure the former vice president to overturn the results of the 2020 election.\u201d We already know that former Pence press secretary Alyssa Farah voluntarily spoke with Republicans on the committee in October. What might they know? Key aides like retired Gen. Keith Kellogg \u2013 Pence\u2019s former national security adviser who was issued a subpoena Tuesday \u2013 were at the White House on January 6 and privy to meetings between Trump and aides who will not testify. RELATED: How Mike Pence\u2019s inner circle could be the key to the January 6 investigation Former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, the subject of committee frustration, made clear for the first time this week that he will not cooperate. But there are few avenues to compel hostile witnesses. In the case of Bannon, the House voted to hold him in criminal contempt of court, but Attorney General Merrick Garland has yet to pursue the charge. Other flies on the wall. Perhaps the Pence witnesses could fill in holes that close Trump allies will not. The committee has also issued subpoenas this week to people who worked at the White House under Meadows, specifically citing their proximity to him. The CNN report goes into much more detail on which Pence aides are of interest and why. Pence may be eyeing his own path. A passage farther down in the report is emblematic of the problem in getting any former Pence aides to cooperate. Pence is charting his own political future, which won\u2019t go very far if he completely turns off the Trump wing of the GOP. \u201cThen there is the looming question of whether Trump himself might run for president again. People close to Pence have told CNN that the former vice president, once known for his unwavering loyalty, won\u2019t wait to see what Trump decides,\u201d write Gangel, Cohen and Warren. What else is coming? Add that potential testimony from Pence aides to the repeated setbacks Trump has faced in trying to shield documents and communications housed at the National Archives from the committee. Trump makes last-ditch effort to stop release of White House records US District Judge Tanya Chutkan this week laid into Trump for his executive privilege claim, pointing out, \u201cPresidents are not kings, and the Plaintiff is not President.\u201d The question of whether Trump can shield the documents seems destined for the Supreme Court. It\u2019s just a matter of how long that process takes. A federal appeals court on Thursday granted Trump\u2019s request to delay the release for now. Precedents suggest Trump has a flimsy case. CNN\u2019s Joan Biskupic considered how the Supreme Court might approach Trump\u2019s effort to shield documents from the inquiry. She writes: \u201cPast decisions involving assertions of executive privilege to keep documents confidential suggest Trump has a weak case, even if heard by this increasingly conservative high court, with three Trump appointees on the nine-member bench.\u201d Richard Nixon also tried to exert executive privilege as a former President \u2013 and that case would seem to undercut Trump since President Joe Biden won\u2019t back his claim of privilege. Biskupic pulls this quote from that 1977 decision: \u201cThe privilege is not for the benefit of the President as an individual, but for the benefit of the Republic.\u201d While she notes the court last year worried that lawmakers could harass a President and interfere with his duties with unacceptable oversight, it\u2019s also true that Trump is no longer President. He has no duties at all.",

            "article_content": "The Trump Organization could lose the keys to an 18-hole public golf course with views of the Manhattan skyline in the coming weeks, making it another likely casualty to stem from former President Donald Trump\u2019s actions on January 6 before rioters stormed the US Capitol. New York City officials terminated the licensing deal in the days after the insurrection with Mayor Bill de Blasio saying, \u201cThe City of New York will not be associated with those unforgivable acts in any shape, way or form.\u201d Trump sued to reinstate it and his attorneys have signaled that they will appeal any adverse rulings, potentially extending the fight for months over who will manage the course known as Trump Golf Links at Ferry Point Park. Mark Meadows says he won't cooperate with House January 6 committee until court rules on Trump privilege claim The case highlights how Trump\u2019s activities during the final days of his presidency continue to haunt him as he navigates numerous criminal investigations and business challenges linked to the Capitol riot. On Tuesday, a federal judge in Washington, DC, ruled that Trump can\u2019t rely on executive privilege to block the National Archives from turning over records to a House committee investigating the riot. Trump on Thursday asked an appeals court to briefly pause the Friday deadline for the documents. And Trump\u2019s continued efforts to upend the 2020 presidential election, including a September letter to Georgia\u2019s Secretary of State asking him to decertify the state\u2019s results, has provided new fodder for the ongoing criminal investigation by Fulton County\u2019s district attorney. The litigation is one of many involving Trump and his business and comes as the company has been indicted on New York state charges relating to an alleged 15-year tax fraud scheme and faces ongoing civil and criminal investigations. The company has pleaded not guilty to the charges and Trump has called the investigations politically motivated. Recently, a new grand jury was impaneled because an earlier grand jury was set to expire to hear evidence from the Manhattan District Attorney\u2019s ongoing investigation into whether the Trump Organization and its executives inflated or lowered valuations to mislead lenders, insurers and tax authorities, a person familiar with the matter said. Fact-checking Trump's letter to Georgia secretary of state Last month Trump sat for a four-hour deposition in a lawsuit alleging an assault in 2015 outside of Trump Tower. On Monday, a judge ruled that the Washington, DC, attorney general\u2019s lawsuit alleging Trump improperly benefited from the President\u2019s Inaugural Committee could move to trial. The judge dropped the Trump Organization from the lawsuit but its hotel on Pennsylvania Avenue remains part of the case. A federal appeals court will hear arguments next month on a defamation lawsuit brought by writer and former magazine columnist E. Jean Carroll, who has accused Trump of raping her in a department store in the mid-1990s. Trump has denied the allegations. And Trump has been ordered by a judge to sit for a deposition by December 23 in a defamation lawsuit brought by former \u201cApprentice\u201d contestant Summer Zervos, who has accused Trump of sexual assault. Trump has denied the allegations. The fight over the golf course is one of the latest examples of Trump\u2019s political rhetoric clashing with his business interests. In August two-thirds of the residents of a 35-story condo tower in White Plains, New York, voted to remove the Trump name from the building and officially change the building name, which has been Trump Tower at City Center since it opened in 2005, said Anthony Schembri, the condo board president. That followed earlier moves by other buildings to strip the Trump name from the properties. The potential loss of the Ferry Point business to the Trump Organization comes at a time when the hotel industry suffered from the pandemic but golf course operators have seen their revenues bolstered as players took to the greens as a safe way to exercise and socialize. According to court filings, Ferry Point brought in over $8 million in revenue for the first 10 months of the year, above its pre-pandemic revenues of $7.28 million over the same period in 2019. Federal judge denies Trump's request to stop E. Jean Carroll lawsuit from moving forward The Ferry Point lawsuit involves a battle over the license to manage the Bronx golf course, which was built on the site of a former landfill and has been licensed to the Trump Organization since 2012. The course is designed by pro-golfer Jack Nicklaus\u2019s company and a clubhouse and restaurant on the grounds opened in 2019. A presidential seal is imprinted on the grass, according to one Instagram post. Days after the January 6 riot on the US Capitol, de Blasio pledged to terminate the city\u2019s relationships with Trump, ending Trump\u2019s management of the Central Park Carousel, two ice skating rinks and Ferry Point. Five days after the Capitol riot, the PGA of America cancelled its agreement to host the 2022 championship tournament at Trump\u2019s Bedminster golf course in New Jersey saying doing so would be \u201cdetrimental\u201d to its brand, and the Royal & Ancient Golf Club of St. Andrews said it would not host any events for the \u201cforeseeable future\u201d at Trump\u2019s Turnberry golf course in Scotland. Park officials cited those statements when terminating the license arguing Trump breached the terms to operate a \u201cfirst class, tournament quality\u201d golf course. \u201cThe actions of the PGA of America and R&A described above are plain, irrefutable evidence that the Ferry Point course\u2019s ability to draw tournaments of the requisite caliber has been significantly impaired by the Trumps\u2019 actions leading to the events of January 6. That is a material breach of the License,\u201d Mitchell Silver, commissioner of New York City\u2019s Department of Parks and Recreation, wrote in a notice denying Trump\u2019s appeal of the termination. In June, the Trump Organization sued New York City alleging breach of contract. It is seeking to have a judge reinstate the license, which was awarded in 2012. A scary portrait of life inside Trump's White House Trump\u2019s attorneys have argued that the city\u2019s decision was based on de Blasio\u2019s animus toward Trump, adding \u201cthere is absolutely nothing\u201d in the license that requires Trump to host a tournament. They also included statements from professional golfers attesting to the high-quality of the course and said terminating their contract would cause the loss of 150 jobs. The city has accused lawyers for the Trump Organization of trying to intimidate potential bidders for the licensing rights, writing in a court filing: \u201cFor example, a September 22, 2021, letter from TFP\u2019s outside counsel to Morningstar Golf & Hospitality referred to TFP\u2019s Article 78 proceeding and warned against entering into a license to operate the course, and advising them \u2018you proceed at your peril.\u2019\u201d Last month the city\u2019s Franchise and Concession Review Committee voted 4-2 to award the remaining 13 years of the license to Bobby Jones Links, an Atlanta-based golf course operator. Park officials told Trump that the licensing agreement ends this Sunday. Trump asked the judge to delay the deadline and she agreed for now. Even if the judge finds that Trump didn\u2019t materially breach the contract, the battle is likely not over. The city could appeal the ruling or move to terminate Trump\u2019s licensing agreement \u201cat will,\u201d and Trump\u2019s lawyers have put the price of a termination payment at $30 million, a figure the city has not endorsed. Supreme Court's Watergate-era rulings against Nixon may end Trump's executive privilege claims \u201cWe\u2019re ready to go the 15th,\u201d Whitney Crouse, founding partner of Bobby Jones Links, told CNN before the judge\u2019s decision to delay the changeover. \u201cWe\u2019re going to keep all the employees. It\u2019s going to be as good or better as before.\u201d Crouse said he\u2019s aware of the risk that Trump could use his pulpit to go after them, but said they bid for the contract because they are confident New York will prevail in the litigation. \u201cWe\u2019ve thought long and hard about that,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m sure something will be said, and it will be in the press, and it will be controversial but six months from now or next year when golf season begins, golfers will have forgotten the issue.\u201d Crouse added, \u201cThe world will move on as it has with other things with Mr. Trump.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Former President Donald Trump\u2019s attempt to withhold records from the House of Representatives related to the January 6 US Capitol attack based on executive privilege \u2013 a claim rejected by President Joe Biden \u2013 would present the US Supreme Court with a novel legal dilemma. But past decisions involving assertions of executive privilege to keep documents confidential suggest Trump has a weak case, even if heard by this increasingly conservative high court, with three Trump appointees on the nine-member bench. \u201cThe privilege is not for the benefit of the President as an individual, but for the benefit of the Republic,\u201d the Supreme Court declared in a 1977 touchstone decision involving former President Richard Nixon. Here's the math behind Donald Trump's continued dominance over the Republican Party More recently, the justices last year expressed concerns that congressional demands for presidential documents could arise from \u201cimpermissible purposes,\u201d such as to harass a president, and interfere with his official duties. In this new case, however, any possible distraction from duties dissolves because Trump no longer holds office. In a decision late Tuesday, US District Judge Tanya Chutkan cited Supreme Court precedent as she ruled against Trump\u2019s effort to obtain an injunction to stop the National Archives from releasing records sought by a US House of Representatives select committee investigating January 6. She noted the unprecedented legal situation: \u201ca former President asserts executive privilege over records for which the sitting President has refused to assert executive privilege.\u201d \u201cAt bottom, this is a dispute between a former and incumbent President,\u201d she wrote in her 39-page opinion. \u201cAnd the Supreme Court has already made clear that in such circumstances, the incumbent\u2019s view is accorded greater weight.\u201d RELATED: January 6 committee interested in at least 5 people from Pence\u2019s inner circle Chutkan brushed away Trump\u2019s argument that he retains control of the privilege, declaring, \u201cPresidents are not kings, and the Plaintiff is not President. He retains the right to assert that his records are privileged, but the incumbent President is not constitutionally obliged to honor that assertion.\u201d Exclusive: January 6 committee interested in at least 5 people from Pence's inner circle The judge rejected Trump again Wednesday night, as the former President continues legal maneuvers to delay the document handover while appeals play out. The National Archives is scheduled to turn over more than 40 pages of documents related to January 6 on Friday, including White House visitor and call logs and three handwritten memos from the files of ex-White House chief of staff Mark Meadows. The House committee contends it urgently needs the records. \u201cThe potential harm to the public is immense,\u201d the House committee wrote in a court filing Wednesday. \u201cOur democratic institutions and a core feature of our democracy \u2013 the peaceful transfer of power \u2014 are at stake.\u201d Trump\u2019s next appeal on the merits of his case would be directed to the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit, before he would proceed to the high court. The Supreme Court scaffolding for the current dispute dates to 1977, when Nixon, three years removed from office, challenged the Presidential Recordings and Materials Preservation Act in his effort to shield Watergate tape recordings and documents. Chutkan noted in her opinion that Nixon had said he planned to destroy the tapes and that, since the entire Nixon ordeal, Congress had adopted the Presidential Records Act, which changed ownership of a president\u2019s official files from private to public; the House committee is seeking the archived Trump files under the act\u2019s terms. The secret Supreme Court: Late nights, courtesy votes and the unwritten 6-vote rule Nixon lost in 1977 by a 7-2 vote. A threshold question for the justices in that case of Nixon v. Administrator of General Services was whether Nixon, as a former president, could assert executive privilege \u2013 a right intended to ensure a president confidentiality in his dealings with advisers and usually given significant protection. In an earlier case, the 1974 United States v. Nixon, the court had said the privilege is not absolute, as it required Nixon to turn over Watergate tapes for a criminal investigation. (Nixon resigned soon after that decision.) In the 1977 Nixon dispute, the justices said a former president can, even after leaving office, assert executive privilege. \u201cThe privilege survives the individual President\u2019s tenure,\u201d Justice William Brennan wrote for the majority. Yet the court emphasized a significant condition relevant to the Trump case: \u201cAt the same time, however, the fact that neither President (Gerald) Ford nor President (Jimmy) Carter supports appellant\u2019s claim detracts from the weight of his contention that the Act impermissibly intrudes into the executive function and the needs of the Executive Branch,\u201d Brennan wrote. \u201cThis necessarily follows, for it must be presumed that the incumbent President is vitally concerned with and in the best position to assess the present and future needs of the Executive Branch, and to support invocation of the privilege accordingly.\u201d Chutkan relied heavily on that seminal opinion Tuesday as she observed that presidential conversations would normally fall under the protections of executive privilege but that the privilege is not absolute. Stephen Breyer says now isn't the time to lose faith in the Supreme Court Just as the Supreme Court in 1977 found that Nixon\u2019s desire to keep and destroy the tapes was surpassed by broader governmental interests, Chutkan stressed that presumption of a privilege can be overcome by legislative or judicial needs. Biden, she wrote, had declined to assert executive privilege because of Congress\u2019 compelling need to investigate the January 6 assault on the Capitol. Among the materials sought are written communications, calendar entries, videos related to the January 6 rally and the White House response to the violence at the Capitol. Rioters broke through barricades at the building as Congress was preparing to count the electoral votes from the 2020 presidential election, which Trump lost to Biden. Trump had spoken at the rally earlier that day, repeating his claims, with no factual basis, that the election had been \u201cstolen\u201d from him and his followers should \u201cfight like hell.\u201d Biden\u2019s endorsement of the US House committee\u2019s request for materials from January 6 eases the separation-of-powers concerns that traditionally loom when Congress seeks presidential materials. In that regard, Chutkan\u2019s opinion drew on the 2020 Trump v. Mazars case, in which the then-President had tried to prevent House Democrats from obtaining certain tax and other financial documents. Trump argued at the time that his role as president should shield him from investigation. The Supreme Court rejected Trump\u2019s broad claim that the House lacked power to subpoena the documents but returned the dispute to lower courts to weigh \u201cspecial concerns\u201d regarding the balance of powers among the branches and the House\u2019s claim that its request flowed from a valid legislative purpose. Chutkan said much of the Supreme Court apprehension in the 2020 document dispute would not apply to the current controversy because of Biden\u2019s position. (Trump also lacks the personal-privacy grounds he raised in the Mazars financial-documents case.) RBG's legacy one year after the liberal icon's death Trump has argued that current House document requests are too broad and would be a burden to fulfill. \u201cBut upon whom is the burden imposed?\u201d Chutkan wrote. \u201cPresident Biden has determined that the requests are not so intrusive or burdensome on the Office of the President as to outweigh Congress\u2019 \u2018compelling need in service of its legislative functions.\u2019 Unlike the circumstances presented in Mazars, here, the legislative and executive branches are in harmony and agree that the requests are not unduly intrusive, thus extinguishing any lingering concerns about the breadth of the requests.\u201d Irrespective of past Supreme Court action on presidential powers, Chutkan, as she chronicled Trump\u2019s false election claims, recalled the strained relations between the former President and the court. She observed that the justices had spurned Trump\u2019s voter fraud arguments in 2020. Wrote Chutkan: \u201cThe United States Supreme Court also denied numerous emergency applications aimed at overturning the results. In response, Plaintiff tweeted that the Court was \u2018totally incompetent and weak on the massive Election Fraud that took place in the 2020 Presidential Election.\u2019 \u201d",

            "article_content": "A federal judge will allow the US House to access hundreds of pages of documents from Donald Trump\u2019s presidency leading up to and about the January 6 attack at the US Capitol, in a forceful rejection of Trump\u2019s recent attempts to control information from his White House. The ruling Tuesday night from Judge Tanya Chutkan of the US District Court in DC is a blow to Trump\u2019s efforts to keep more than 700 pages of records from his White House secret \u2013 though his legal team has informed the court it intends to appeal. \u201cPresidents are not kings, and Plaintiff is not President,\u201d she wrote. As of now, the National Archives remains on track to turn over to the House a number of documents on Friday, including White House call logs, video logs and schedules related to January 6 as well as three pages of handwritten notes from Trump\u2019s then-chief of staff. The outcome in court also could help the House in its pursuit of more information from those around Trump, including witnesses who\u2019ve been subpoenaed and haven\u2019t spoken to the committee yet. \u201cThe court holds that the public interest lies in permitting \u2013 not enjoining \u2013 the combined will of the legislative and executive branches to study the events that led to and occurred on January 6, and to consider legislation to prevent such events from ever occurring again,\u201d Chutkan wrote in a 39-page opinion. Judge denies Trump's overnight request to stop Archives from turning over his records The judge, in her ruling, shut down Trump\u2019s arguments in court on several fronts. She decided that a former president\u2019s wishes couldn\u2019t overcome the decisions of the current president regarding protecting privileged information of the executive branch. \u201cIt is the incumbent President who is best situated to protect executive branch interests,\u201d Chutkan said. She also knocked down Trump for any attempts to protect himself out of secrecy. Presidential privilege \u201cexists for the benefit of the Republic, not any individual,\u201d she wrote. Because of that, Congress and the courts can access presidential communications when there\u2019s a need to inform the public, the judge decided. In this case, the judge said she wouldn\u2019t look at Trump\u2019s records document by document and wouldn\u2019t second-guess the Biden administration\u2019s decision to release them. She also noted that though the committee has made sweeping requests for requests, it does \u201cnot exceed\u201d its legislative power. The former Republican President filed his lawsuit last month in DC District Court, claiming executive privilege and alleging that the House\u2019s requests for documents are \u201cunprecedented in their breadth and scope\u201d and illegitimate. January 6 committee issues 10 more subpoenas, including to Stephen Miller and Kayleigh McEnany The Biden White House has declined to intervene to block access to the Trump records. The National Archives, which inherited Trump\u2019s presidential records after he left office, has said it will begin handing over records to the House committee next week, on November 12, with more document productions set for later in November. \u201cThe Court\u2019s opinion is consistent with what the President has already said, that January 6th represented an \u2018existential crisis\u2019 for our democracy and that it is absolutely vital for there to be a full accounting of the events on that day to ensure that something like that never happens again,\u201d White House spokesman Mike Gwin said in a statement Wednesday. The case has already become an historic test of the power of a former president. Some of the records Trump has sought to keep secret include White House visitor records, call logs, and notes from his top advisers related to his claims that the 2020 presidential election was stolen and his reaction to the January 6 attack, according to a sworn declaration from the National Archives. The House has argued to the court that Trump has no right to keep the documents confidential from his presidency and say the need for the records is to reconstruct Trump\u2019s actions on January 6 and his efforts to undermine the 2020 election. Rep. Bennie Thompson, who chairs the House select committee, called the ruling a \u201cbig deal\u201d for the congressional probe, telling CNN\u2019s Chris Cuomo on \u201cCuomo Prime Time\u201d that he looks forward to the panel\u2019s investigators \u201cgoing through (the documents) with a fine-tooth comb to make sure that our government was not weaponized against its citizens.\u201d \u201cWe can only do that by getting access to the information. I applaud our lawyers who defended us in this court setting,\u201d the Mississippi Democrat said. \u201cI applaud the expeditious ruling that we got because we have to get to this.\u201d This story has been updated with a statement from the White House Wednesday.",

            "article_content": "A federal judge sent a message to Donald Trump Tuesday that he cannot outrun the rule of law and the Constitution forever. But that doesn\u2019t mean he won\u2019t try. A late-night ruling eviscerated the ex-President\u2019s assertion of executive privilege to prevent the National Archives from turning over hundreds of documents pertinent to the House probe examining the January 6 Capitol insurrection. Although Trump is already mustering an appeal, the ruling represented a huge win for the House select committee probing one of the most alarming assaults on democracy in US history. It also came as a swift blow to Trump\u2019s efforts to run out the clock ahead of a possible Republican takeover of the House next year, which would mean an almost certain end to the investigation. It upheld a core principle underpinning the checks and balances of American democracy that allows the court system to step in to adjudicate a dispute between a chamber of Congress and the executive over the extent of presidential power. Most intriguingly, it also represents the first test of Trump\u2019s ability to use the court system to defy Congress when he is not shielded by the office of the presidency itself. It could have implications for the power of ex-presidents as it relates to executive privilege. \u201cPresidents are not kings,\u201d Judge Tanya Chutkan wrote, adding: \u201cAnd Plaintiff is not President,\u201d as she ruled that current commander in chief Joe Biden \u2013 and not the former occupants of the office \u2013 is the determining factor in privilege claims. For much of a term that constantly stretched and almost buckled the principles of American democracy, Trump did seem to believe he had the authority of a king. Indeed, the President who was twice impeached for abuses of power once declared that Article 2 of the Constitution meant that he had \u201cthe right to do whatever I want as President.\u201d But Chutkan\u2019s ruling shows that as an ex-President, Trump\u2019s belief in his own omnipotence and right to flout the rule of law is on even weaker ground than during his four tumultuous years in office. Tuesday\u2019s ruling offers an immediate boost to the committee investigating the January 6 attack by a pro-Trump mob on the US Capitol. The panel has been struggling to get key figures around the ex-President to testify about his coup attempt. It has already cited Trump\u2019s longtime political guru Steve Bannon for contempt of Congress and is waiting to see whether the Justice Department will underwrite its authority and open a prosecution in the case. New January 6 subpoenas increase pressure on Garland to set an example with Bannon The committee has sent out another flurry of subpoenas to Trump White House aides and outside advisers this week, but until Attorney General Merrick Garland makes a decision on Bannon\u2019s fate, the extent of the panel\u2019s capacity to work its will remains in doubt. The committee wants to examine White House call and visitor logs, schedules and notes from top officials including former chief of staff Mark Meadows, to flesh out a full picture of the ex-President\u2019s actions in the run up to the insurrection. It wants to find out who was advising Trump, whether the march on the Capitol was pre-planned, and learn about his failure to stop the marauding mob once it had breached the Capitol building. In her opinion, Chutkan wrote that the House had every interest in examining all aspects of that fateful day \u201cand to consider legislation to prevent such events from ever occurring again.\u201d Trump\u2019s lawyers had cast doubt on the notion that the House had a \u201clegislative purpose\u201d in seeking the documents \u2013 and portrayed its subpoenas as broad and unprecedented power grabs. For their part, Trump\u2019s lawyers had also asserted an extraordinarily broad claim of executive privilege that in effect could have meant that information \u2013 some of which is fairly routine \u2013 pertinent to the Trump presidency could be kept from the public in perpetuity. Executive privilege is the doctrine under which presidents can expect that advice they get from officials will remain confidential. The tradition is critical to the notion of separation of powers in ensuring the integrity of the executive branch and, in practice, is vital to presidents during great national crises. But while former presidents are deemed to enjoy some protection from executive privilege for events that occurred during their time in office, the final decision is seen to actually rest with the sitting president. Biden had decided that the national interest represented by gaining an accounting for the January 6 insurrection outweighed Trump\u2019s desire to keep material secret. What is executive privilege? Does a former president still get it? Chutkan upheld that view. \u201cIt is the incumbent President who is best situated to protect executive branch interests,\u201d Chutkan said, adding that presidential privilege \u201cexists for the benefit of the Republic, not any individual.\u201d In invoking the phrase, \u201cPresidents are not kings,\u201d the judge was repeating a line used by Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson in a case over former White House counsel Don McGahn\u2019s defiance of an early subpoena. Ultimately McGahn did testify to Congress, but several years after the initial subpoena, a  model Trump seems to be following now in a bid to frustrate the Capitol insurrection probe. Trump\u2019s appeal of Tuesday night\u2019s ruling on its own will not stop the National Archives beginning to hand over documents by a Friday deadline. But he could seek a court order to halt the process while litigation makes it through the appeals courts. Trump\u2019s strategy potentially also means that the case could ultimately end up at the Supreme Court and produce unprecedented answers on the extent of an ex-president\u2019s powers regarding executive privilege. The select committee\u2019s chairman, Rep. Bennie Thompson, a Democrat of Mississippi, had harsh words for Trump after the ruling was announced. \u201cIf you take your issue to court and lose, then you need to man up and deal with it and not be a spoiled brat, so I look forward to getting this information,\u201d Thompson told CNN\u2019s Chris Cuomo. Yet in private, business and political life, Trump is a serial and often frivolous litigant and regards the court system as a way to delay accountability as much as an enforcement mechanism for the law. So his appeal \u2013 in a process that has long been clear is intended to run out the clock on the committee \u2013 is no surprise. A spokesman for Trump, Taylor Budowich, tweeted a statement that indicated that the former President sees Tuesday\u2019s ruling as a temporary setback in a much longer process. \u201cThe battle to defend Executive Privilege for Presidents past, present & future\u2014from its outset\u2014was destined to be decided by the Appellate Courts,\u201d Budowich wrote. \u201cPres. Trump remains committed to defending the Constitution & the Office of the Presidency, & will be seeing this process through.\u201d The idea that Trump is acting to defend the integrity of an office whose traditions he frequently trampled \u2013 and almost destroyed at the end of his term earlier this year \u2013 is a laughable one. His lies about a stolen election and attempts to use the power of his office to thwart a peaceful transition of power and to deny the will of voters in a free and fair election offer a more accurate reading of his attitude toward the Constitution.

            "article_content": "The House select committee probing the January 6 insurrection placed its credibility and legal clout deeper into the hands of Attorney General Merrick Garland on Monday with a new flurry of subpoenas targeting cronies of ex-President Donald Trump. For the committee to retain hopes of compelling testimony from the group, it may need the Justice Department to initiate a prosecution against another Trump adviser, Steve Bannon, who has already defied a subpoena. The former President\u2019s populist alter ego earned a rare contempt of Congress citation for his intransigence. But two-and-half weeks on, the department has yet to say whether it will act on that gambit and indict Bannon through the Washington, DC, US Attorney\u2019s office. Without such a move, the committee\u2019s enforcement capacity looks in serious doubt as it races to conclude before Democrats are at risk of losing the House of Representatives in next year\u2019s midterm elections. There are no current and public signs that Garland is feeling pressure to act quickly. In fact, a deliberative process would comply with his effort to shield the department from politicization after Trump weaponized it to protect himself during a scandal-plagued presidency and in his effort to steal the 2020 election. But that also means the new batch of six Trump confidants, who have been subpoenaed for their alleged role in amplifying Trump\u2019s lie about election fraud or abetting his coup attempt earlier this year, have reason to replicate the obstruction, at least for now. And even if Bannon is prosecuted, a long process of court cases and appeals could bog down the committee in a legal nightmare. Steve Bannon's popular podcast is a 'dangerous' fantasyland of election lies Such a scenario would not only allow Trump aides to outwit the committee\u2019s efforts to find the truth about the most flagrant assault on a US election in modern history. It could gut the power of Congress in the future and limit its constitutional role of serving as a check and balance on the executive branch. And it would also mean that Trump, who incited a mob to march on Congress and disrupt the certification of President Joe Biden\u2019s election win, would escape a reckoning yet again, even as he and his party paper over his autocratic tendencies ahead of a likely bid for the 2024 GOP nomination. The refusal of Trump\u2019s orbit to submit to scrutiny is nothing new; it was a feature of both his impeachments, including over the insurrection earlier this year. The six subpoenas issued on Monday targeted conservative lawyer John Eastman, former New York City Police Commissioner Bernard Kerik, Trump campaign officials Bill Stepien, Jason Miller and Angela McCallum, and former national security adviser Michael Flynn. The list includes some of Trump\u2019s most hardcore loyalists. Flynn and Kerik, for instance, received presidential pardons. While it is possible some of the group might decide to talk to the committee, it would be no surprise if most declined, given the Trump White House\u2019s enduring resistance to disclosure and accountability. \u201cIf Merrick Garland does not prosecute Steve Bannon, all these other witnesses \u2026 they are going to have no deterrent either and they are going to see it as a free-for-all to do what they will. So there is a lot riding on what Merrick Garland decides to do here,\u201d CNN legal analyst Elie Honig said. Garland refused to discuss his deliberations in an unrelated media appearance Monday. The roughly two-week gap after Bannon\u2019s contempt citation is hardly a lifetime in legal terms, however, so it would be unwise to read anything into it yet. Merrick Garland is caught in a pickle with Steve Bannon California Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff, a member of the House select committee, said on CNN on Monday evening that the Justice Department needed time to study the case and precedent but said acting to enforce congressional subpoenas was crucial. \u201cIf the Justice Department doesn\u2019t hold Steve Bannon accountable, it only lends credence to the idea that some people are above the law and that cannot be true in this country,\u201d Schiff said on \u201cCuomo Prime Time.\u201d The new subpoenas followed the refusal of another witness, former Justice Department official Jeffrey Clark, to answer questions from the committee on Friday, citing Trump\u2019s assertions of executive privilege and attorney-client privilege. But like Bannon, the six potential witnesses subpoenaed on Monday were not serving government officials at the time of the insurrection so should have no protection under the doctrine that allows presidents to revive confidential advice from their official advisers. The extent to which the custom applies to ex-presidents is also a gray area. And Biden, with whom final adjudications of privilege now rest given his constitutional role, has declined to comply with Trump\u2019s bid for the shielding of hundreds of White House documents. But making broad, and what many analysts see as frivolous, executive privilege assertions could allow the former President to frustrate the committee and hamper the search for truth for months. That would have grave implications for the US political system and the separation of powers, said former Ohio Gov. John Kasich, who is also a former Republican member of Congress. \u201cIf nothing happens, if you can just say, \u2018I don\u2019t really care what you think,\u2019 I think you lose your power and I think that Congress needs to be protective of that power,\u201d Kasich told CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer on \u201cThe Situation Room.\u201d \u201cNow it\u2019s about January 6, but how many other things will come down the road and people will say, \u2018I don\u2019t have to show up?\u2019\u201d The committee said Monday the six new subpoenas targeted Trump associates who helped perpetuate the lie that the 2020 election was stolen. January 6 committee acts on multiple fronts in a race against time \u201cThe Select Committee needs to know every detail about their efforts to overturn the election, including who they were talking to in the White House and in Congress, what connections they had with rallies that escalated into a riot, and who paid for it all,\u201d chairman Bennie Thompson, a Mississippi Democrat, said in a statement. Perhaps the most prominent member of the group is Eastman, who crafted a blueprint for then-Vice President Mike Pence to throw the election to the House of Representatives, where Republican delegations could award Trump a second term. The committee is under pressure to produce a legal argument that it has a legislative purpose for its efforts, and some members have spoken of drafting new laws that could thwart similar attempts to the one laid out by Eastman. In the end, Pence concluded he had no power to overrule the will of voters who had chosen Biden \u2013 much to Trump\u2019s fury. CNN\u2019s KFile reported last month that Eastman said on Bannon\u2019s radio show that Pence had the power to throw the election to the House if he had \u201ccourage and the spine.\u201d His memo sketched a scenario whereby the vice president would disregard seven states\u2019 Electoral College votes \u2013 making sure no candidate received the 270 Electoral College votes needed for victory. Since each state delegation had one vote to cast for president, Trump would win since Republicans controlled 26 state delegations. The subpoenas also mark a new twist in the sinister and often bizarre tale of Flynn, a retired lieutenant general and former head of the Defense Intelligence Agency who transformed into a vehement pro-Trump conspiracy theorist. Flynn was forced to resign as national security adviser within days of Trump taking office in 2017 after lying to Pence about a call with the Russian ambassador. Trump pardoned Flynn for lying to the FBI about his contacts with Moscow\u2019s envoy. The committee said in the statement that it wanted to interview Flynn about a December 2020 meeting in the Oval Office during which \u201cparticipants discussed seizing voting machines, declaring a national emergency, invoking certain national security emergency powers, and continuing to spread the false message that the November 2020 election had been tainted by widespread fraud.\u201d According to the committee, Flynn also gave an interview to Newsmax TV and spoke about \u201cseizing voting machines, foreign influence in the election, and the purported precedent for deploying military troops and declaring martial law to \u2018rerun\u2019 the election.\u201d The committee cited Miller\u2019s presence at a self-styled command center for Trump allies at the Willard Hotel in Washington in January. The panel also says Stepien and Miller were part of Trump\u2019s \u201cStop the Steal\u201d effort. It says it has information that McCallum may have been involved in efforts to pressure Michigan state legislators to overrule Biden\u2019s Wolverine State victory. And Kerik, an associate of former Trump personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani, has previously confirmed to CNN that he paid for hotel rooms and suites in Washington used as \u201celection-related command centers.\u201d Trump pardoned Kerik over a conviction for multiple felonies including tax charges. The broad scope of Monday\u2019s subpoenas confirms that the committee is looking beyond the events of January 6 and is delving deep into Trump\u2019s longer-term plotting to overthrow the election. But the chances of all those subpoenaed eventually testifying to the committee seem somewhat unlikely \u2013 whatever happens to Bannon \u2013 unless the Justice Department is willing to wage multiple cases against ex-Trump officials who all refuse to cooperate. In that sense, the panel \u2013 which has already interviewed 150 witnesses behind closed doors \u2013 may be using the subpoenas to underscore the broad nature of suspicious activity in Trump\u2019s orbit.",

            "article_content": "Former Justice Department official Jeffrey Clark on Friday stonewalled the House select committee investigating January 6, responding to a subpoena demanding he appear for an interview with the panel, but not answering questions posed to him, sources familiar with his appearance told CNN. Instead, Clark provided a letter from his attorney Harry MacDougald that claimed he could not provide testimony until a court declares that his interactions with former President Donald Trump are not protected under attorney-client privilege or executive privilege. CNN has not obtained a copy of the letter, first reported by Politico, but confirmed its contents through a source with knowledge of the letter. Committee Chairman Bennie Thompson said in a statement later Friday that he had considered and rejected Clark\u2019s claim that he didn\u2019t have to answer questions under subpoena. \u201cHe has a very short time to reconsider and cooperate fully,\u201d the Mississippi Democrat said. \u201cWe need the information that he is withholding and we are willing to take strong measures to hold him accountable to meet his obligation.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s astounding that someone who so recently held a position of public trust to uphold the Constitution would now hide behind vague claims of privilege by a former President, refuse to answer questions about an attack on our democracy, and continue an assault on the rule of law,\u201d Thompson said. MacDougald, an Atlanta-based attorney, previously worked on the pro-Trump lawsuits that pushed unfounded claims of election fraud. Timeline of the coup: How Trump tried to weaponize the Justice Department to overturn the 2020 election He worked with former President Donald Trump\u2019s ex-lawyer Sidney Powell on a lawsuit against Georgia Republican Gov. Brian Kemp and Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger that aimed at overturning Joe Biden\u2019s win in the state. It was among the dozens of unsuccessful lawsuits filed by Trump\u2019s legal team after his election loss in an attempt in court to gain traction on voter fraud. Clark was one of the officials within the Justice Department pushing to pursue unfounded claims of voter fraud in the weeks after the November election, and, according to officials who interacted with him, was in touch with Trump repeatedly. So far, Clark is one of only a few then-Trump administration officials to have received a congressional subpoena. Clark\u2019s appearance was delayed until Friday, after he parted ways with a lawyer who was preparing him to the House last week. The appearance lasted about an hour and a half, during which time Clark and his attorney walked in and out of the room on several occasions. Neither Clark, nor MacDougald, would answer questions as they left. Going into the session, Clark did not describe his level of cooperation with the panel. \u201cI\u2019m going in,\u201d Clark told CNN Friday morning upon walking into an office building. \u201cMr. Clark is subject to a sacred trust \u2013 one that is particularly vital to the constitutional separation of powers,\u201d Clark\u2019s lawyer wrote in his 15-page letter. \u201cAs a result, any attempts \u2013 whether by the House or by the current President \u2013 to invade that sphere of confidentiality must be resisted.\u201d MacDougald also referenced Trump\u2019s lawsuit seeking to block the committee from obtaining more than 700 records related to January 6. He suggested that the committee delay its request for Clark\u2019s testimony until that lawsuit is resolved. On Thursday a federal judge heard arguments in that case and appeared deeply skeptical that Trump could block lawmakers from obtaining evidence that is relevant to their investigation. Previously, Trump hasn\u2019t attempted to block former Justice Department officials from speaking to members of Congress about his election fraud antics, and Clark doesn\u2019t appear to have any extensive executive privilege shield available to him. Yet other officials from the Trump White House have delayed their testimonies, and Trump is already in court arguing to keep documents from his presidency private. As a sympathizer to election fraud conspiracy theories, Clark became Trump\u2019s most useful asset inside the Justice Department in the days before January 6. Clark helped Trump devise a plan to oust the then-acting attorney general, place himself atop the department and have the DOJ intervene in Georgia to set aside its voting results in order to sway the state toward Trump. When Clark\u2019s superiors learned of his scheming with Trump in early January, they threatened to resign en masse. Democratic Rep. Jamie Raskin, a member of the committee who also served as a House manager for Trump\u2019s impeachment related to January 6, told CNN previously he was \u201cvery eager\u201d for Clark\u2019s testimony. \u201cClark had a lot to do with this plan for January 6,\u201d Raskin said, \u201cand he also was apparently making a play to become the Attorney General, which caused a huge number of lawyers to say they would resign immediately. So we would get something like the Saturday Night Massacre that took place back during the Watergate period.\u201d Raskin said the committee is interested in learning about any efforts behind the scenes at the Justice Department to oppose the certification of the Electoral College vote, the process that was interrupted when Trump supporters violently overran the Capitol. Previously, the Senate Judiciary Committee released its own lengthy staff report detailing how Trump and his allies pressured DOJ to overturn the 2020 election. In that nearly 400-page report, Clark\u2019s name appears more than 200 times and casts him as the agency\u2019s pivotal figure helping Trump, according to other witnesses from the Justice Department. In one particularly poignant scene, the report recounts a December 26 call that Clark received from then-acting Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen, who spoke at length with the Senate committee.  Rosen wanted to know why Trump had mentioned Clark in a previous phone call. When Clark told Rosen he had previously met with Trump, Rosen called being \u201cflabbergasted.\u201d The Senate Judiciary Committee, which did not interview Clark for its investigation, described several other elected officials, lawyers working with Trump and even lower-level Justice Department employees who appeared to support Clark\u2019s efforts at DOJ. The Senate report also noted a meeting just before Christmas Day where Trump met Clark and Republican congressmen at the White House. But the report was unable to nail down the extent of coordination among the election fraud theorists without insight from inner-circle witnesses like Clark. In addition to the characters around Trump, handwritten notes of a December 27 discussion between the President and top Justice Department officials document that Trump said he wanted to put Clark in a leadership role and that Republicans in Congress could promote Trump\u2019s election fraud theories. At the time of Clark\u2019s push, the DOJ had already determined the voter fraud theories were largely unfounded. Trump\u2019s reference to Clark, an environmental lawyer temporarily filling the civil litigation leadership role at Justice \u201csurprised\u201d then-acting Deputy Attorney General Richard Donoghue \u201cbecause Clark \u2018didn\u2019t have anything to do with the Department\u2019s election responsibilities,\u2019\u201d the Senate wrote, citing Donoghue\u2019s own testimony to the Committee. Separately, Perry spoke to Donoghue about Clark as well, telling Donoghue he liked Clark and thought Clark could \u201cdo something about this,\u201d the Senate Judiciary Committee noted, again citing Donoghue\u2019s testimony. By New Year\u2019s, Clark was asking for an intelligence briefing about election interference and sent Donoghue his proposal for the Justice Department to announce investigations into the vote in Georgia. He and the DOJ leadership met with Trump on January 3. At that meeting, Donoghue and others told Trump there would be mass resignations at the Justice Department if the President were to fire the acting attorney general and put Clark in charge. All of Clark\u2019s actions came at the end of December, \u201cfollowing personal communications with Trump, including at least one meeting that Clark attended in the Oval Office without the knowledge of DOJ leadership,\u201d the Senate Judiciary Committee wrote. But they were not able to detail exactly what Trump has said. That work may be left for the House investigators. This story has been updated with additional details. Correction: An earlier version of the headline and story misspelled Jeffrey Clark's name.

            "article_content": "The House probe into the Capitol insurrection is making its most significant strides yet in gaining understanding of Donald Trump\u2019s behind-the-scenes maneuvering before and during his coup attempt against American democracy. The Democratic-led committee is acting on multiple fronts but is in a race against time. First, it is confronted by the ex-President\u2019s obstruction as he tries to dodge accountability. And haunting the panel\u2019s every move is the possibility of a new Republican-led House after the 2022 midterm elections that would likely close it down. The committee was in court Thursday fighting Trump\u2019s bid to keep documents about what happened in the White House on January 6 on dusty National Archives shelves. It\u2019s firing off new subpoenas as it tries to sketch a true picture of what really happened in the days running up to that shocking day. And on Friday, a key member of the inner circle that gathered around Trump ahead of those dark hours is expected to show up on Capitol Hill for an interview. Federal judge skeptical of Trump's efforts to block release of presidential documents Ultimately, the committee is charged with producing clarity about one of the most aberrant days in American history. Although what happened now feels less alarming, partly because of the repetition of video of Trump supporters invading the Capitol and the attempts by Republicans and conservative media to rewrite history, it is still staggering. An American President refused to accept the result of a fair, democratic election and tried to defy the will of voters by using the power of his office and violence to steal another term. In an apparently positive sign for the investigators, a federal judge Thursday expressed skepticism over Trump\u2019s broad assertions of executive privilege over hundreds of documents related to his actions on January 6 that he is struggling to keep secret. At a dramatic moment in the hearing on the matter, Judge Tanya Chutkan asked Trump\u2019s lawyers why they were arguing that he had the right to stop public access to the records, following the assault on the Capitol. \u201cAre you really saying that the President\u2019s notes, talking points, telephone conversations, on January 6 have no relation to the matter on which Congress is considering legislation?\u201d she asked. \u201cThe January 6 riot happened in the Capitol. That is literally Congress\u2019 house.\u201d Chutkan has yet to rule. But in a move that may buttress their legal case, several committee members have said they are considering drawing up legislation to stop any similar coup attempt. The committee on Friday could get its most intriguing glimpse yet into Trump\u2019s behavior in the dangerous days earlier this year when America\u2019s democracy was on the brink. Jeffrey Clark, the former Justice Department official who floated plans to give Georgia\u2019s legislature backing to undermine popular vote results, is expected to comply with a subpoena and sit for an interview with the committee. Clark also pushed unfounded conspiracy theories about voter fraud, and at one point was involved in dramatic consultations with Trump in the Oval Office about possibly becoming acting attorney general, according to a Senate investigation released last month. A week after Congress cited Trump\u2019s onetime political guru and former White House official Steve Bannon for contempt of Congress after he ignored a subpoena, January 6 committee Chairman Bennie Thompson said Thursday that more subpoenas are on the way. The Mississippi Democrat said the subpoenas would come out \u201csoon,\u201d possibly by Friday. He would not confirm if former Trump lawyer John Eastman, whom CNN has reported is likely to be subpoenaed, is part of that group. But he said: \u201cSome of the people have been written about. Some of the people haven\u2019t been written about.\u201d January 6 committee chair said he has signed about 20 new subpoenas that are going out 'soon' Eastman has emerged as a central figure in Trump\u2019s efforts to subvert the constitutional process of certifying a new president and to defy the will of voters with his attempt to cling to power. The conservative lawyer drew up a now-notorious memo with step-by-step instructions about how then-Vice President Mike Pence, who was presiding over the certification process, could throw the election result into the House of Representatives, where a majority of Republican delegations could award the presidency to Trump. Many legal scholars have suggested Eastman\u2019s reasoning is hairbrained and unconstitutional. But multiple reports suggest that Trump, whose ego could not accept that he had been beaten fair and square by Joe Biden, took it seriously. And CNN\u2019s KFile reported that Eastman said on Bannon\u2019s radio show in January that the scheme depended on if Pence had \u201ccourage and the spine.\u201d In another development on Thursday that shows the gathering pace of the House select committee\u2019s work, its vice chairman, GOP Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming, revealed that investigators had interviewed 150 people despite lengthy negotiations with other subpoenaed Trump officials and associates that are delaying testimony. Trump is also facing scrutiny outside Washington. Investigators in Fulton County, Georgia, are considering whether his pressure on the Peach State\u2019s Republican secretary of state, Brad Raffensperger, to find votes to cancel out Biden\u2019s win in the state was criminal. CNN\u2019s Sara Murray and Jason Morris revealed on Thursday that even Trump\u2019s post-presidential campaign of lies and chicanery on the issue is within the scope of the investigation. Prosecutors have, for instance, sought an original copy of a letter that Trump sent to Raffensperger in September demanding that he decertify an election that had taken place 10 months earlier. Trump's antics give investigators fodder for probe into his efforts to upend Georgia's 2020 election results But it\u2019s the House committee that represents the last chance for an official accounting of the worst attack on democracy in modern American history. Republicans have sought to thwart the committee every step of the way \u2013 even pulling support for a bipartisan deal on an independent 9/11-style commission after Trump loudly complained. While the select committee is led by Democrats, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi also appointed Cheney and Rep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois to sit on the panel. Both Republicans are staunch conservatives but outspoken critics of Trump\u2019s anti-democratic antics \u2013 a stance that has ostracized them in their party. Pro-Trump forces plan to challenge Cheney for her seat in Wyoming and she lost a plumb party leadership post in the House Republican conference earlier this year. Kinzinger just announced he would retire at the end of his term after expressing despair over his party\u2019s failure to defend the rule of law. Rep. Jamie Raskin, the lead impeachment manager in Trump\u2019s trial earlier this year and a member of the committee, explained on CNN last Saturday why it was so interested in getting the trove of documents. \u201cWe want to document a complete record of everything that was going on, really minute by minute, during the day of the insurrection,\u201d the Maryland Democrat said. The urgency facing the committee was only underscored this week as large swings away from Democrats in the Virginia and New Jersey gubernatorial races reinforced fears in the party that it will lose the House in the midterm elections. It is almost inconceivable that Republicans who have anchored their campaign for 2022 on Trump\u2019s base voters would continue to investigate the Capitol insurrection if they take power. And the ex-President\u2019s growing attempt to hide his role on January 6 is taking place as he plots a political comeback that could be damaged by a damning report from the committee. Even if it ends up being frivolous, his legal campaign could delay the turnover of documents, schedules and call lists, including some related to former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows. Biden has refused to shield the documents with executive privilege \u2013 a concept meant to offer presidents the confidence that private consultations with advisers on matters of state will remain confidential. But Trump is also clearly keen to prevent the committee finding out how involved he may have been in planning the Capitol riot and what steps he failed to take to quell it as lawmakers fled for their lives and police officers were beaten up by his supporters. His efforts are a key component of his increasingly likely 2024 campaign, as he eyes another term, which would likely test the strength of democratic institutions even more than his first. Even if the judge rules against Trump in the case, it is likely the former President will lodge appeals up to and including the Supreme Court. Former presidents are considered to have some expectation of executive privilege, but the final say on the scope of that protection rests with the person holding the office of the presidency, not with the ex-President. Biden has said he believes that the circumstances of the Capitol insurrection are so grave that Congress has an interest in finding out what happened and so he declined to help Trump\u2019s bid to stop the National Archives from releasing the documents. John Dean, White House counsel to President Richard Nixon and a key witness in the Watergate investigation, said he didn\u2019t believe that Judge Chutkan was buying the Trump team\u2019s arguments on executive privilege. Dean thinks that ultimately the courts will not uphold Trump\u2019s attempt to assert privilege over all the documents but could narrow the select committee\u2019s request. \u201cI think in the long run there will be a limited right for a former president to withhold documents \u2013 otherwise it makes this privilege meaningless \u2013 but not an over-broad privilege that Trump is trying,\u201d Dean told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper on Thursday.

Judge Tanya Chutkan pressed Trump\u2019s lawyers on why, as a former President, he has any right to control the public access to hundreds of pages of records, especially as the House of Representatives investigates the insurrection. \u201cAre you really saying that the President\u2019s notes, talking points, telephone conversations, on January 6, have no relation to the matter on which Congress is considering legislation?\u201d Chutkan asked. \u201cThe January 6 riot happened in the Capitol. That is literally Congress\u2019 house.\u201d Chutkan, however, also suggested the House\u2019s request could be too broad. Trump has asked the DC District Court to block the National Archives from giving more than 700 pages of documents to the House Select Committee investigating January 6 and his efforts to overturn the 2020 election. He\u2019s claimed the House\u2019s investigation is illegitimate, and that his role as a former President should give him control over reviewing and deciding upon access to the records. The Biden administration has approved of handing them over to the House select committee beginning next week. Trump\u2019s lawyers are even attempting to keep White House visitors logs secret \u2013 the types of records that past and even the current presidential administration have released. \u201cThe former President has rights,\u201d Justin Clark, an attorney for Trump, argued. Chutkan also harshly questioned Trump\u2019s request for the court to look at every document one by one \u2013 \u201cYou\u2019re talking years,\u201d she said \u2013 and an argument his attorney made that the White House records should theoretically be more guarded than even Trump\u2019s personal tax records, which he is still fighting in court to keep secret. \u201cCongress here has not requested private information,\u201d Chutkan said. \u201cThese documents are sought to further Congress\u2019 oversight into the events of January 6. They only seek documents concerning governmental activity.\u201d New January 6 court filings reveal what Trump is trying to keep secret from Congress The hearing may be the pivotal moment in a potentially historic legal fight about the authority of a former president, the House\u2019s investigative power and the reach of executive privilege. In the short term, the case also may have huge implications for the bipartisan House investigation, which is pushing for records and witnesses before the midterm elections take place next year. Without access to the documents, the House could be hampered significantly in its fact-finding. After grilling Trump\u2019s lawyers, Chutkan challenged the House Democrats\u2019 lawyer on the breadth of the documents that were requested by the committee \u2013 a key issue, because the former President has claimed the request was so massive that it is clearly a political fishing expedition. Chutkan acknowledged that \u201csome of these requests seem very narrowly tailored.\u201d But she said on a few occasions during the hearing that other parts of the committee\u2019s request covered a wide scope of records, saying it was \u201calarmingly broad,\u201d \u201cvery broad,\u201d and \u201creally broad.\u201d Congress has broad authority to demand documents, but \u201cthere has to be some limit,\u201d she said. She said a request for Trump\u2019s polling data from summer 2020 was \u201ctangential\u201d to the January 6 investigation. She also zeroed in on a request for documents from April 2020, and asked House Democrats\u2019 top lawyer Doug Letter to explain how those materials were tied to the insurrection. \u201cWe think, maybe, this all ties in with, leading up to this, the fomenting of it, the building a groundswell of feeling that this election was going to be tainted,\u201d Letter said, alluding to Trump\u2019s comments early on during the pandemic that the election would be rigged by mail-in voting. Letter owned the fact that some of the requests were broad, but said \u201cthat\u2019s for Congress to decide,\u201d and said the federal courts shouldn\u2019t tell lawmakers how they should run their inquiry. Chutkan also made the point that to the House that some of the things they may want to see from the Trump White House they don\u2019t really need, because Trump was already making his intentions clear, publicly. She especially questioned a House request for polling data. When Letter described how the House sought any information that could illuminate why the then-President was tweeting about election fraud even before the election, the judge quipped, \u201cI\u2019m not sure there\u2019s an answer why the President was tweeting whatever he was tweeting.\u201d In court, the House has cast its investigation as one of its most critical tasks in history. \u201cIn 2021, for the first time since the Civil War, the Nation did not experience a peaceful transfer of power,\u201d lawyers for the House wrote over the weekend. \u201cA peaceful transfer of power from one President to another is crucial to the continuation of our democratic government. It is difficult to imagine a more critical subject for Congressional investigation, and Mr. Trump\u2019s arguments cannot overcome that pressing legislative need.\u201d Any result is likely to be appealed, but the clock will be ticking for both the House and for Trump. The National Archives, a part of the executive branch that inherited Trump\u2019s presidential records after he left office, has already decided the House should get access to the records from Trump\u2019s term as President. The agency is set to turn those over beginning next week, on November 12, unless Chutkan or an appeals court orders otherwise. Trump has turned to the court system several times in recent years to slow down or block Congress from accessing records he believes should stay private. The courts are still working out many of those disputes, such as in cases related to his personal accounting firm\u2019s work, his IRS tax returns and his company\u2019s banking records. While President, he was able to hold off House subpoenas of his closest advisers using broad privilege claims and the Justice Department\u2019s backing. And even before Trump\u2019s presidency, lawsuits over executive privilege in document collections have dragged on for years. But the issues about executive privilege that Trump raises now put the court in a novel position weighing the needs of the House against his pleas for privacy for his now-completed time in office. \u201cPermitting the expansive request here would harm future presidents and their close aides by allowing invasive congressional fishing expeditions that will certainly chill candid advice and harm the institution of the presidency,\u201d Trump\u2019s lawyers wrote to the court this week. The records Trump wants to keep secret at this time appear to be a treasure trove of notes from his top advisers related to his insistence the election was stolen and his reaction to his supporters attacking the US Capitol on January 6. They include parts of the files from chief of staff Mark Meadows, from whom the committee has been seeking testimony, and other key figures like press secretary Kayleigh McEnany. In recent weeks, Meadows has engaged with the House but hasn\u2019t come forward to speak \u2013 an apparent stalemate that could shift depending on the Trump court case\u2019s outcome. The Archives has given a taste of what Trump is trying to protect in a list, down to the page count, of the handwritten memos, draft public statements, call logs to Trump and former Vice President Mike Pence, White House visitor records and more from the files of key White House officials. Those types of records, if obtained by the House, could answer some of the most closely guarded facts of what happened minute by minute between Trump and other high-level officials, including people around him watching the siege and those officials who were under attack. The Biden White House has decided it wouldn\u2019t asserted executive privilege on the records the Archives has reviewed so far, citing the extraordinary situation of the attack on Congress. The Archives continues to work through Trump\u2019s papers and set dates for them to be shipped to Congress. \u201cPresident Biden\u2019s sober determination that the public interest requires disclosure is manifestly reasonable, and his to make,\u201d lawyers for the Biden administration have written in court. Trump is trying to keep secret more than 700 pages from the files of his closest advisers up to and on January 6, according to a sworn declaration from the National Archives\u2019 B. John Laster. Those records include working papers from then-White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, the press secretary and a White House lawyer who had notes and memos about Trump\u2019s efforts to undermine the election. In the Meadows documents alone, there are three handwritten notes about the events of January 6 and two pages listing briefings and telephone calls about the Electoral College certification, the archivist said. Laster\u2019s outline of the documents gave a glimpse into the paperwork that would reveal goings-on inside the West Wing as Trump supporters gathered in Washington and then overran the US Capitol on January 6. Trump is also seeking to keep secret 30 pages of his daily schedule, White House visitor logs and call records, Laster wrote. The call logs, schedules and switchboard checklists document \u201ccalls to the President and Vice President, all specifically for or encompassing January 6, 2021,\u201d Laster said. The records Trump wants to keep secret also include draft speeches, a draft proclamation honoring two police officers who died in the siege and memos and other documents about supposed election fraud and efforts to overturn Trump\u2019s loss of the presidency. A lawyer for the Biden administration was in rare alignment with the House, advocating for the disclosure of the records and against Trump at the hearing on Thursday. \u201cThe former President does not have a freestanding right to challenge the entire legislative venture,\u201d Elizabeth Shapiro, a Justice Department attorney representing the National Archives, said in court. She also noted that the records Trump wants to protect will be public someday. The Archives\u2019 policies typically keep White House records restricted for 12 years, she said, but branches of government can get access to them before that. \u201cThese are not documents where privilege and confidentiality will survive forever. Far from it,\u201d she said. This story has been updated with details from the hearing.",

            "article_content": "Members of the January 6 committee are working on potential legislation to tighten the process of certifying a presidential election in an effort to eliminate contentious avenues that spurred the January 6 riot, sources tell CNN. The legislation would give the committee a focus on developing a law as part of the investigation, undercutting a legal argument that former President Donald Trump has made that the committee has no true legislative purpose for seeking his White House documents. The effort is still in its early stages, but a proposed bill could offer more specific instructions for when Congress can overturn a state\u2019s slate of electors, and more clearly define the role the vice president plays in counting the votes \u2013 after Trump and his allies pressured Mike Pence to try to block President Joe Biden\u2019s win, the sources say. Specifically, members are focused on making changes to a 19th Century law known as the Electoral Count Act that was intended to give Congress a process by which to certify the Electoral College votes submitted by the states. It\u2019s a mundane but crucial part of the presidential election machinery, one that Trump and his allies attempted to exploit last year. Election law experts and those urging reform warn that in light of January 6, the 134-year-old law needs to be updated and strengthened to ensure that a losing party can never subvert the results of the Electoral College. \u201cThe bigger fruit of the 2020 experience is that every phase of the presidential election process has been thrown into doubt and is now littered with boobytraps,\u201d Rep. Jamie Raskin, a Maryland Democrat who is one of the select committee members involved in the discussion, told CNN. David Becker, executive director and founder of the nonpartisan Center for Election Innovation and Research, says changes are needed to \u201climit objections to a few valid issues, such as if a state fails to certify electors by the deadline, and make clear the purely ceremonial nature of the joint session,\u201d adding such clarification would, \u201cprevent a future VP from being pressured to subvert the states\u2019 electoral choices.\u201d The effort to craft such a bill began in the House Administration Committee, which is chaired by Rep. Zoe Lofgren of California and vice chaired by Raskin. Both Democrats were named to the select committee, where the talks now also include Republican Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming. Raskin said no decisions had yet been made on what any legislation coming out of the committee might entail. \u201cThe Select Committee is working hard to uncover the facts about January 6th and its causes, and we will consider many possible legislative and policy proposals as we craft our report,\u201d the panel\u2019s chairman, Rep. Bennie Thompson of Mississippi, said in a statement to CNN. \u201cOne of the most important parts of the select committee\u2019s work is to help ensure that nothing like January 6th ever happens again, and we take that mandate very seriously.\u201d Cheney, ostracized from the House GOP conference for joining the Democrats\u2019 investigation, addressed the effort last week on a podcast with political strategist James Carville and political journalist Al Hunt. \u201cWe\u2019re looking at the 1887 Electoral Count Act and whether or not we need to make amendments to that in order to ensure that in the future this kind of objection to electors isn\u2019t so subject to potential abuse.\u201d Congressional Republicans have roundly rejected Democrats\u2019 push to pass voting rights legislation this year. By crafting a bill out of the House select committee investigating January 6, Democrats may offer a narrower path to address at least election subversion. While the discussions were already underway before Trump\u2019s lawsuit, the effort could give the committee a defense against accusations from Trump and his allies that its subpoenas are invalid because it serves no legislative purpose. Earlier this month, Trump filed a lawsuit to try to block the investigation from obtaining records from his presidency by claiming executive privilege, while also charging that the panel\u2019s requests for documents from the Executive Branch \u201care unprecedented in their breadth and scope and are untethered from any legitimate legislative purpose.\u201d A new bill could also address the now infamous Eastman memo, drafted by conservative lawyer John Eastman, which laid out a six-step plan for how Pence could have certified the election in favor of Trump. The memo argued that the Electoral Count Act itself was unconstitutional. Eastman proposed Pence throwing out the votes of enough states that Biden won so that the presidential election would be decided by the House, where each state gets a single vote and Republicans controlled more state delegations. READ: Trump lawyer's full memo on plan for Pence to overturn the election Becker says changes to the Electoral Count Act could prevent such a coup attempt laid out by Eastman. \u201cThe VP is not granted some extra-constitutional superpower to replace the judgment of the voters, of the states, with his or her own personal preference,\u201d said Becker. \u201cThe ECA could be amended to make that clear.\u201d Raskin said the lawmakers would also look at whether they should raise the bar for lawmakers to object and make it harder for state legislatures to overturn the popular will of a state\u2019s voters. \u201cFiguring out how to prevent this kind of derailment of the presidential election is extremely complicated,\u201d Raskin said. Any new legislation would likely come after the committee finishes its investigation, sources said, as the panel\u2019s findings would likely influence how the bill is written. Thompson has said he wants the committee to move quickly, and they swiftly held Trump adviser Steve Bannon in contempt when he defied the panel\u2019s subpoenas. But the committee\u2019s efforts to pry loose documents and testimony could still get tangled up in court battles, making it difficult for the committee to finish its probe. They\u2019re also waiting to see what the Justice Department does with Bannon\u2019s contempt citing. Despite breaking with most House Republicans on Trump\u2019s complicity in January 6 and the need for a select committee to get to the bottom of it, Cheney has not shown any interest in joining House Democrats to pass their sweeping voting rights bill targeting new restrictions on voting in the states. Senate Republicans have blocked several Democratic bills this year. It\u2019s too soon to say if Cheney\u2019s involvement could lead to a different outcome for a bill focused on election subversion. It would require 60 votes in the Senate, and the support of 10 Republicans could be difficult \u2013 especially if the effort is seen as a rebuke to Trump in the midst of the midterm campaign season. Three days before the January 6 congressional certification of Biden\u2019s win and the attack on the Capitol, Cheney wrote a memo to her Republican colleagues arguing that their objections were at odds with the Constitution and \u201cour core beliefs as Republicans.\u201d \u201cBy objecting to electoral slates, members are unavoidably asserting that Congress has the authority to overturn elections and overrule state and federal courts,\u201d Cheney wrote. \u201cSuch objections set an exceptionally dangerous precedent, threatening to steal states\u2019 explicit constitutional responsibility for choosing the President and bestowing it instead on Congress.\u201d Edward Foley, an election law professor at Ohio State University, has urged Congress to update the Electoral Count Act since before the 2020 election. He\u2019s argued that the law should make it clearer that after a state properly affirms its slate of electors, Congress shouldn\u2019t be able to easily intervene to throw them out. Had the House and Senate supported the objections \u2013 if one party controlled both chambers of Congress and the other party had won the White House, for instance \u2013 it could have thrown out the electors and pushed the presidential election to the House, creating the potential for a constitutional crisis. \u201cIn 2025, this kind of power grab and repudiation of the constitutional procedure could make a difference if the votes are there,\u201d Foley told CNN. Foley added: \u201cWhat we\u2019ve been through this year is evidence we need to fix it before next time.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Specifics about former President Donald Trump\u2019s efforts to keep secret the support from his White House for overturning his loss of the 2020 election were revealed in late-night court filings that detail more than 700 pages of handwritten notes, draft documents and daily logs his top advisers kept related to January 6. The National Archives outlined for the first time in a sworn declaration what Trump wants to keep secret. And the US House has told a federal court that Trump has no right to keep confidential more than 700 documents from his presidency, citing a committee\u2019s need to reconstruct Trump\u2019s efforts to undermine the 2020 election and his actions on January 6. The court filings are in response to a lawsuit Trump brought nearly two weeks ago in which he is attempting to block congressional investigators from accessing hundreds of pages of records they requested from the National Archives, which inherited Trump\u2019s presidential papers. The House presents itself as in agreement with the Biden administration, in an unusual show of inter-branch alignment, to oppose Trump. Trump lawyer John Eastman said 'courage and the spine' would help Pence send election to the House in comments before January 6 The records Trump wants to keep secret include handwritten memos from his chief of staff about January 6, call logs of the then-President and former Vice President Mike Pence and White House visitor records, additional court records revealed early Saturday morning. \u201cIn 2021, for the first time since the Civil War, the Nation did not experience a peaceful transfer of power,\u201d the House Committee wrote. \u201cThe Select Committee has reasonably concluded that it needs the documents of the then-President who helped foment the breakdown in the rule of law. \u2026 It is difficult to imagine a more critical subject for Congressional investigation.\u201d Trump\u2019s court case is a crucial and potentially historic legal fight over the authority of a former president to protect his term in office, the House\u2019s subpoena power and the reach of executive privilege. Trump is trying to keep secret from the House more than 700 pages from the files of his closest advisers up to and on January 6, according to a sworn declaration from the National Archives\u2019 B. John Laster, which the Biden administration submitted to the DC District Court on Saturday. Those records include working papers from then-White House chief of Staff Mark Meadows, the press secretary and a White House lawyer who had notes and memos about Trump\u2019s efforts to undermine the election. In the Meadows documents alone, there are three handwritten notes about the events of January 6 and two pages listing briefings and telephone calls about the Electoral College certification, the archivist said. Laster\u2019s outline of the documents offers the first glimpse into the paperwork that would reveal goings-on inside the West Wing as Trump supporters gathered in Washington and then overran the US Capitol, disrupting the certification of the 2020 vote. Trump is also seeking to keep secret 30 pages of his daily schedule, White House visitor logs and call records, Laster wrote. The call logs, schedules and switchboard checklists document \u201ccalls to the President and Vice President, all specifically for or encompassing January 6, 2021,\u201d Laster said. Those types of records could answer some of the most closely guarded facts of what happened between Trump and other high-level officials, including those under siege on Capitol Hill on January 6. The records Trump wants to keep secret also include draft speeches, a draft proclamation honoring two police officers who died in the siege and memos and other documents about supposed election fraud and efforts to overturn Trump\u2019s loss of the presidency. Some of the questions Trump has raised in his lawsuit have never before been decided by a court. If Trump convinces judges to put Archives\u2019 document productions on hold as the case makes its way through appeals, the delay tactic could cripple parts of the House panel\u2019s investigation. Generally, the House has sought records held by the Archives that speak to plans to disrupt the electoral count in Congress, preparation for the pro-Trump rallies before and on January 6 and what Trump had learned about the soundness of voting after the election. The ex-President now claims he should have the ability to assert executive privilege even when the current President will not, and that the House\u2019s requests for records from his presidency are illegitimate. So far, the Biden White House has declined to keep information about the Trump White House leading up to January 6 private, citing the \u201cextraordinary\u201d Trump-led attempt to overturn the 2020 election and the ongoing bipartisan House investigation. And the Archives \u2013 represented by Biden\u2019s Justice Department in court \u2013 has sided with President Joe Biden\u2019s directions. In its own court filing overnight, the National Archives backed the House\u2019s request for access, arguing that the attack on the Capitol is worthy of waiving executive privilege. \u201cPresident Biden\u2019s sober determination that the public interest requires disclosure is manifestly reasonable, and his to make,\u201d lawyers for the Biden administration wrote in court. The Archives has said it plans to begin releasing disputed Trump-era records to the House beginning November 12, unless a court intervenes. Judge Tanya Chutkan of the US District Court in DC will hold a key hearing on Trump\u2019s lawsuit on Thursday. In recent days, the fight over the Trump-era National Archives documents has been heating up. A bipartisan group of 66 former members of Congress, including some Republicans who had served in leadership posts, told a federal court earlier this week they support the US House in the case. Their position comes in a \u201cfriend of the court\u201d brief this week that Chutkan could look to for legal guidance. The former members say the need for Congress to understand the January 6 attack shouldn\u2019t be undermined by Trump, and they are urging Chutkan to reject his request for a court order that would stop the Archives from turning over documents. \u201cAn armed attack on the United States Capitol that disrupted the peaceful transfer of presidential power \u2013 and not the document requests necessary to investigate it \u2013 is the only grave threat to the Constitution before the Court,\u201d the former members write. A group of government transparency organizations, law professors and other experts are also supporting the House, and the Archives turning over the Trump records, according to court filings. The case also could play into the possible criminal prosecution of Trump ally Steve Bannon, who has defied a subpoena from the House January 6 committee by pointing to Trump\u2019s challenge in court and the possibility the former President might try to claim communications with Bannon are protected. The House voted to hold him in contempt last week, and the Justice Department has said it is evaluating whether to prosecute him.",

            "article_content": "Former Justice Department official Jeffrey Clark will not testify Friday before the House select committee investigating the January 6 insurrection, according to a committee aide and a source with knowledge of the matter. Clark, a Justice Department official who was integral to helping then-President Donald Trump in his efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election, was given a postponement after he parted ways with his lawyer and is retaining new counsel, the committee aide said. In addition, former Trump aide Dan Scavino has been granted a brief postponement from responding to his subpoena and is continuing to \u201cengage\u201d with the committee, the aide said. The Trump allies\u2019 testimony could help House investigators fill in the blanks about the former President\u2019s thinking \u2013 and potentially point them to other key players around him. Former Justice Department official who backed unfounded voter fraud claims parts with lawyer Clark, a Trump-appointed environment law chief at the Justice Department, has become a major figure in the emerging narrative about behind-the-scenes efforts by Trump and his closest allies to orchestrate a leadership coup at the DOJ and peddle lies about election fraud. While Clark was one of the prime officials within the department pushing to pursue unfounded claims of voter fraud in the weeks after the November election, his attempts were rebuffed by acting Attorney General Jeffery Rosen and his deputy Richard Donoghue. Both Rosen and Donoghue have cooperated with the committee. Clark\u2019s actions were slammed in a nearly 400-page report by the Senate Judiciary Committee. The Senate Democrats\u2019 lengthy staff report detailing how Trump and his allies pressured the Justice Department to overturn the 2020 election named Clark more than 200 times and cast him as the agency\u2019s pivotal figure helping Trump, according to other witnesses from the Justice Department. The House select committee, meanwhile, has suggested that because of Scavino\u2019s close proximity and long history of working with the former President, he can provide useful information regarding conversations Trump had on January 5 about trying to convince members of Congress to not certify the election, the former President\u2019s movements on January 6, and the broader communication strategy the White House had in the lead up to the January 6 rally. He was subpoenaed by the committee earlier this month after the panel\u2019s initial difficulty physically locating him. The former Trump aide is among a group of ex-administration officials who had been recently instructed by an attorney for the former President to not provide any testimony or documents to the investigative panel. The attorney for Trump has claimed that the former officials are protected \u201cfrom disclosure by the executive and other privileges, including among others the presidential communications, deliberative process, and attorney-client privileges.\u201d President Joe Biden has so far declined to assert executive privilege on Trump\u2019s behalf for documents the former President has sought to keep out of the hands of the select panel. This story has been updated with additional details Thursday. CNN\u2019s Devan Cole, Katelyn Polantz and Kaitlan Collins contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Members of the House select committee investigating January 6 are losing patience with the pace of talks with former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, and some are considering whether more aggressive steps are needed to force his compliance in the sweeping probe, multiple sources tell CNN. Meadows was first subpoenaed more than a month ago, and since then the committee has indicated he\u2019s been \u201cengaging\u201d in negotiations over the terms of his turning over documents and appearing for a deposition. But weeks after the committee granted Meadows a \u201cshort\u201d but indefinite postponement of the initial subpoena deadline, members are growing increasingly frustrated and contemplating when and how to ramp up the pressure. Here's what happens if a congressional subpoena is ignored (and what it means for the January 6 committee) As one of former President Donald Trump\u2019s closest advisers, Meadows has unique insight into what Trump knew in the lead-up to January 6 and in its direct aftermath. And the committee is pressing to learn more about how Meadows aided an effort to overturn the 2020 presidential election, noting in his subpoena that he had communicated with \u201cthe highest officials at the Department of Justice requesting investigations into election fraud matters in several states.\u201d Among the options being considered is officially setting a new deadline for Meadows to comply with the committee\u2019s subpoena or risk being held in criminal contempt, the path it pursued with Trump ally Stephen Bannon. After making clear from the outset that he had no intention of cooperating with the panel, Bannon now faces possible prosecution for defying his subpoena. \u201cOur patience isn\u2019t unlimited, and engagement needs to become cooperation very soon,\u201d a select committee source told CNN, calling Meadows a \u201ckey witness\u201d in the investigation. \u201cAs we\u2019ve already made clear, anyone who tries to stonewall our effort will face the consequences.\u201d Democratic Rep. Bennie Thompson, who chairs the committee and is charged with weighing considerations from all members, told CNN on Wednesday the panel is not yet at the point when it needs to take the matter of Meadows\u2019 compliance to court. But Thompson added: \u201cIf and when the staff says to us it\u2019s not going anywhere, there won\u2019t be any hesitation on the part of the committee to make the referrals.\u201d Meadows\u2019 attorney, George Terwilliger, and his former chief of staff Ben Williamson both declined to comment. The committee\u2019s road ahead with Meadows is inherently more complicated than it was with Bannon because as Trump\u2019s chief of staff Meadows could have legitimate executive privilege protections. So far, the Biden administration has showed a considerable amount of support for the House investigation \u2013 declining to assert privilege over Bannon and multiple batches of documents, leaving many committee members encouraged that the White House will not offer blanket protection for Meadows. Pressure on January 6 panel ratchets up amid new explosion of Trump election lies But executive privilege is not the only factor at play here. Members of the panel are weighing how much time to give Meadows before his non-compliance undermines their investigation. One source with intimate knowledge of the negotiations told CNN it\u2019s becoming \u201cincreasingly clear\u201d that Meadows has \u201cno real intention\u201d of providing documents or testimony to the committee. Several members of the committee have said in recent days that pursuing criminal contempt charges is on the table for any witness \u2013 including Meadows \u2013 who defies a subpoena. \u201cI do know that if we reach the conclusion that they\u2019re not operating in good faith, and that if they\u2019re not going to show up, then we will hold them in criminal contempt as we did with Mr. Bannon,\u201d Rep. Adam Schiff, a California Democrat, told reporters last week when asked about Meadows. Should the committee institute a new subpoena deadline for Meadows, it could set up a standoff that could escalate into a legal fight. In contrast to Meadows, Bannon never engaged with the committee. He didn\u2019t show up on the day his subpoena required him to, and his attorney sent a letter to the committee saying he wouldn\u2019t cooperate until the committee reached an agreement with Trump over what was privileged information \u2013 or a court ruled on the matter. Biden's refusal of executive privilege claim ignites new firestorm with Trump Some committee members expect Meadows will ultimately refuse to comply, too, and both sides have signaled they are preparing to litigate, according to two sources familiar with the situation. Bannon, now a podcast host, had been fired from his White House role years before the January 6 insurrection but continued to support Trump and worked with \u201cStop the Steal\u201d activists agitating to overturn the 2020 election results. In letters to the National Archives, White House Counsel Dana Remus has repeatedly said the White House believes the insurrection and the events surrounding it were \u201cunique and extraordinary\u201d and that Biden has determined that an \u201cassertion of executive privilege is not in the best interests of the United States.\u201d Biden\u2019s legal advisers have been very clear that they\u2019re approaching the privilege questions prompted by the January 6 investigations on a case-by-case basis. January 6 committee plans to subpoena John Eastman If Biden\u2019s White House allows full access to testimony and documents from Meadows, that could set a precedent and invite a GOP-led probe into his administration if Republicans take control of one or both chambers of Congress next year. And before then, any move to shield parts of Meadows\u2019 account from Congress could invite blowback from the left and from Democratic allies on Capitol Hill. The White House counsel\u2019s office has already begun discussing with the Justice Department\u2019s Office of Legal Counsel how executive privilege could apply to Meadows, a source familiar with the matter told CNN. Merely consulting with OLC does not signify that the White House will grant Meadows any privilege protections. The White House has previously consulted with OLC in this investigation and still opted not to assert privilege. CNN\u2019s Melanie Zanona and Tierney Sneed contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "A version of this story appeared in CNN\u2019s What Matters newsletter. To get it in your inbox, sign up for free here. Former President Donald Trump\u2019s effort to deny the 2020 election results has ricocheted in Washington and around the country. CNN\u2019s Dana Bash reported an hourlong special looking at how Trump\u2019s lies about the election led to new voting laws in key states. I talked to her about what she learned from the project, which airs Wednesday at 9 p.m. ET. Our conversation, conducted by email, is below. WHAT MATTERS: It is October of an off-year. There are a smattering of elections coming, but most Americans won\u2019t vote for a year. Why make this special now? BASH: Because what is happening right now in key states across the country will have a huge effect on whether and how voters have access to the ballot, and who oversees the process that counts and certifies the votes that are cast. There was record turnout in 2020, even though the election came in the middle of a pandemic, before vaccines were available. The reason for the unprecedented participation in a lot of states was because Covid-safe voting measures made it easier for people to vote in general. It turns out that when you make it easier for people to vote \u2013 they do so in bigger numbers. And there was no evidence of widespread fraud. Again, there was no evidence of widespread fraud. But that\u2019s not what conservative voters are being told by President Trump, his allies and like-minded media that amplify the lies. GOP-led legislatures are rolling back access to the ballot for the next elections and this will have an effect on voting in these states, and in turn the balance of power in Congress in 2022 and even the presidency in 2024. WHAT MATTERS: What\u2019s your bottom-line takeaway from making this special? What\u2019s happened to American democracy since November 2020? BASH: The short answer from election expert after election expert \u2013 including Republicans like veteran GOP lawyer Ben Ginsberg \u2013 is that American democracy is in danger. Most of the Republicans we talked to said they believed the 2020 election was free and fair \u2013 but said their constituents do not. Some of them basically admitted, in the most careful of terms, that they changed the laws in their states because of pressure from their own base who are being fed lies about 2020. But the threat is bigger than Donald Trump and the big lie. What we heard repeatedly was GOP-led legislators using it to justify voting changes because of demographic changes that increase minority votes, which tend to support Democrats, and are making the Trump base smaller. They are passing laws that will increase GOP chances of staying in power by restricting access to the ballot and taking more control of the process of counting the votes. WHAT MATTERS: The stated reason for these laws is election security, but you talked to Republicans who said there\u2019s a more directly political reason behind them, to drive down the minority vote. Is there enough evidence to make that conclusion? BASH: Republicans told me that this is what you do after elections \u2013 you look at what went right, you look at what went wrong, and you fix it for the next time. But an election law expert I talked to told me point blank: They\u2019re looking at what went right and banning what went right. Take Harris County, Texas, which includes Houston. It has a huge minority voting population and they came out in record numbers thanks in part to 24-hour voting for shift workers and drive-thru voting \u2013 coronavirus-prompted innovations. Although Donald Trump won Texas, Joe Biden won Harris County thanks in part to easier access to voting. There was no evidence of fraud in Harris County, but the GOP legislature banned drive-thru and 24-hour voting. That will disproportionately affect communities of color and they are the ones who used those methods of voting. WHAT MATTERS: Republicans in states told you they want new, more restrictive voting laws to create uniformity. But at the national level they oppose another kind of uniformity \u2013 a national standard \u2013 to protect voting rights. Do they acknowledge those conflicting ideas? BASH: They don\u2019t \u2013 and it\u2019s a really interesting question. Because they believe election law and procedure to be a state issue, not a federal one. One expert I talked to used Texas as an example, where they limit one drop box per county. Harris County \u2013 which has about the population of Louisiana \u2013 will have one drop box. And a rural county with a few thousand people will get the same treatment. So there\u2019s a bit of an irony in arguing that a state as demographically diverse as Texas should have uniform laws, but the country as a whole should not. WHAT MATTERS: The great irony of undermining faith in the election system, as Trump has done, is that politicians need people to vote to win elections. How did you see that dichotomy playing out? BASH: It\u2019s a great observation \u2013 and it\u2019s true that by casting doubt on the system, Trump\u2019s big lie is potentially discouraging his supporters from participating. He even said that if we don\u2019t \u201csolve\u201d the problem of election fraud, \u201cRepublicans will not be voting in \u201922 or \u201824.\u201d That\u2019s his not-so-subtle way of pushing Republicans in states that haven\u2019t already succumbed to election law changes to do so. But he is even pushing states he won \u2013 like Texas \u2013 to conduct sham audits in Texas\u2019 big cities that he lost. That is the kind of thing that election experts across the ideological spectrum say sows doubt in the voting process \u2013 which is the fundamental underpinning of America\u2019s democratic process. The other obvious consequence of Trump\u2019s anti-democracy effort is the search for accountability by the January 6 committee on Capitol Hill. Not all Trump allies are refusing to cooperate. CNN\u2019s Kaitlin Collins reported Tuesday that multiple former White House officials \u2013 at least five \u2013 have voluntarily given information to the committee. This is in contrast to those who have ignored subpoenas, like Steve Bannon, the former Trump aide turned election provocateur, and close Trump adviser Dan Scavino. CNN separately reported the committee is reaching out to former Trump aides including Chad Wolf, who was acting secretary of Homeland Security, and Ken Cuccinelli, an acting deputy secretary. Read more. New feud over executive privilege. Trump wants to exempt his aides from testifying and protect documents from committee investigators by claiming executive privilege. There was a new development on that front Monday, when Biden rejected Trump\u2019s claim to privilege on a second batch of documents the committee is seeking from the National Archives. Republican appointed by Biden to lead DHS election office. Kim Wyman, Washington state\u2019s Republican secretary of state, will lead Department of Homeland Security efforts to protect elections from foreign and domestic interference. She\u2019s refuted Trump\u2019s false claims of election fraud. Officials who rejected Trump\u2019s election fantasy live in fear, face threats. CNN\u2019s Isaac Dovere and Jeremy Herb report on how secretaries of state \u2013 Republicans and Democrats who stood up for the valid election results in their states \u2013 have been targeted by election deniers and often fear for their safety. Arizona\u2019s Katie Hobbs shared vulgar and threatening voice mails with CNN. \u201cI think you should be hunted,\u201d a woman says in one recording. \u201cDie you bitch, die!\u201d says a man, repeatedly, in another. The reporters also talked to Colorado\u2019s Jena Griswold, who has contracted private security.",

            "article_content": "At least five former Trump administration staffers have voluntarily spoken with the House committee investigating the January 6 attack on the US Capitol, CNN has learned. Those discussions come as lawyers working for the committee have also reached out to a range of other Trump aides to inquire whether they would be interested in speaking with the committee voluntarily, without the threat of a subpoena. The five former staffers who have had conversations with the committee have done so with either members or their staff. Some believe they have information worth sharing, while others are hoping to avoid being legally compelled to talk to the committee. \u201cI\u2019ve got good reason to believe a number of them are horrified and scandalized by what took place on January 6th and they want to do their legal duty and their civic duty by coming forward to explain exactly what happened,\u201d Rep. Jamie Raskin, a Democratic member of the committee, said on CNN\u2019s \u201cThe Lead with Jake Tapper\u201d Tuesday. \u201cWe\u2019re going to continue to encourage everybody who has relevant information to come and talk.\u201d Biden's refusal of executive privilege claim ignites new firestorm with Trump The engagement could provide insight for the committee that\u2019s seeking to learn more about the actions of former President Donald Trump and his supporters in the lead up to the riot. According to five former Trump aides, counsel for the committee has emailed or texted them directly to ask whether they are interested in coming in to talk to the congressional investigators, often looking for context on what happened inside the West Wing before the insurrection on January 6. While several people have voluntarily sat down with the committee, others have declined the committee\u2019s request or not responded at all. The outreach has ranged from junior-level staffers to more seasoned officials. What is executive privilege? Does a former president still get it? The outreach is not necessarily because the committee believes the staffers were involved in what happened that day. But the investigative staff appears to be trying to glean more context on what was happening inside the West Wing before, during and after the attack, according to the sources. A committee spokesman declined to comment. CNN previously reported that Alyssa Farah, former director of strategic communications in the Trump White House, had voluntarily met with Republicans on the House select committee and provided information in several meetings, sources familiar with the matter said. Farah left the White House in December 2020. RELATED: Former DOJ official Jeffrey Clark, who pushed baseless election fraud claims, expected to testify before January 6 committee 'House Republicans hate Steve Bannon, but they fear him' says former Trump comms director News of the outreach comes as Trump is engaged in a legal battle over the committee\u2019s investigation. Trump has sued the committee and the National Archives in an attempt to shield documents from them. And an attorney for the former President recently instructed four former Trump administration officials \u2013 Mark Meadows, Dan Scavino, Stephen Bannon and Kash Patel \u2013 not to provide any testimony or documents to the investigative panel, claiming they are protected \u201cfrom disclosure by the executive and other privileges, including among others the presidential communications, deliberative process, and attorney-client privileges.\u201d On Monday, White House counsel Dana Remus informed the National Archives once again that President Joe Biden is refusing to assert privilege over additional documents that Trump argues should remain secret. This story has been updated with additional details. CNN\u2019s Ryan Nobles contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Joe Biden and Donald Trump are locked in an extraordinary and escalating clash that has profound political consequences now and into 2024. Biden took the showdown, which was triggered by the fallout over the US Capitol insurrection, up another notch on Monday by refusing to assert executive privilege over a second batch of documents that Trump wants to prevent the National Archives from turning over to the House select committing probing the January 6 attack. The development was first reported by CNN. There have been occasions in US history when former presidents have sniped at and tried to undermine their successors. Many presidents have expressed private frustration with the antics of their predecessors. But nothing in the modern era matches the confrontation between the 45th and 46th Presidents. Trump is mostly responsible for that. He has convinced tens of millions of his voters that Biden is an illegitimate president through lies about voter fraud. The twice-impeached former President\u2019s attempt to hamstring the January 6 committee is also in line with his repeated efforts to avoid consequences for his anti-democratic behavior. What is executive privilege? Does a former president still get it? Trump\u2019s claims that he alone has the right to assert executive privilege also appear designed to obstruct the committee\u2019s work with interminable legal suits and appeals through multiple courts. Paradoxically, efforts to hold the former President to account may offer him the kind of oxygen he craves for his politics of insurrection. Trump had already filed a lawsuit to try to prevent an earlier batch of documents reaching the committee after Biden refused to intervene. He is all but certain to add the latest material to his suit as he seeks to disrupt the effort to investigate the origins of the mob riot he incited on January 6 and to run down the clock in the hope Republicans win the House next fall and shutter the probe. The showdown with Biden will only fuel Trump\u2019s attempts to turn efforts to investigate the tumultuous end to his presidency into fodder for a political comeback. He\u2019s already making the midterms and the 2024 presidential election into a platform for his falsehoods that power was stolen from him in a rigged election. Trump and his allies have branded Biden\u2019s refusal to cooperate with his political power grabs as evidence of a political vendetta against the ex-President. The last thing that Biden wants, however, is yet more confrontations with his once and potentially future rival. Since winning election last year, Biden has tried to bring a fractured country together \u2013 even as Trump\u2019s lies about election fraud and misinformation spewed by his media propagandists have only exacerbated the mood of fury among \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d devotees. Sometimes, the current President has referred to his predecessor as \u201cthe former guy,\u201d not even wishing to mention his name. And the continuing tussle between Biden and Trump over documents is just one of the unfinished disputes that ensures that the poisoned legacy of the Trump presidency will linger in the United States for months and years to come. No president since Gerald Ford \u2013 who ended up pardoning Richard Nixon after the Watergate scandal that led to his resignation \u2013 has been handed such a tortured legacy from an immediate predecessor. And Trump is only fanning the febrile mood of his supporters by almost every day challenging Biden\u2019s right to be president and inciting deeper national divides on the basis of a lie that he won the election. But much as he wants to consign Trump to the past, Biden has little incentive to obstruct the work of the committee on the basis of a procedural matter like executive privilege. Accepting Trump\u2019s claims that he is protecting the integrity of the office of the presidency would require Biden to junk his own argument that he was elected to save American democracy, which prevailed despite a severe test in the Trump years and during the presidential transition in January. And Trump, who regularly trashed decorum and the traditions of the presidency, didn\u2019t appear too worried about protecting it in four years in the Oval Office. But the latest escalation between Trump and Biden is also likely to further inflame the political conflagration raging ahead of Trump\u2019s potential political comeback and even a possible 2024 presidential rematch with his successor. The National Archives is set to start turning over documents to the House committee by November 12 \u2013 unless Trump gets a court order to halt the process. According to a letter from White House Counsel Dana Remus, \u201cPresident Biden has determined that an assertion of executive privilege is not in the best interests of the United States, and therefore is not justified.\u201d \u201cAccordingly, President Biden does not uphold the former President\u2019s assertion of privilege,\u201d Remus wrote. The House select committee has specifically asked for all White House documents and communications on January 6, such as call logs, schedules and meetings of top officials and outside advisers, including Rudy Giuliani. Bannon contempt vote puts Attorney General Merrick Garland in center of legal and political storm The showdown over the documents is not the only dispute in which Trump is trying to assert executive privilege \u2013 a doctrine under which presidents expect that their advice and internal communications from advisers is confidential. Trump has asked several senior former associates, including former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, to also claim that they are unable to comply with subpoenas from the committee on the same grounds. The most controversial of these cases involves Steve Bannon, who was last week cited by the House for criminal contempt of Congress. The former Trump political guru\u2019s claims are regarded by legal experts as especially thin since he was not a government official at the time of the Capitol insurrection. And apart from his conversations with Trump, the committee wants to question him over any contacts with organizers of the Trump rally that preceded the march on the Capitol on January 6. According to Washington Post journalists Bob Woodward and Robert Costa in their book \u201cPeril,\u201d Bannon was a key figure in a \u201cwar room\u201d at Washington, DC\u2019s, Willard Hotel, that also included Giuliani, and had multiple contacts with the then-President and attempted to pressure then-Vice President Mike Pence to refuse to certify Biden\u2019s election in Congress. A decision on whether to prosecute Bannon in yet another legal proceeding that could delay the work of the committee now rests with the Justice Department. The question of how far ex-presidents can assert executive privilege has not been definitively tested in the courts, which is one reason why Trump\u2019s claims could lead to prolonged litigation and a potentially historic moment. Presidents have sometimes been open to executive privilege claims from predecessors in the apparent hope that they can expect similar courtesy when they leave office. General practice has been that past presidents consult with the legal team in the current White House and the sitting president makes a final adjudication on the privilege claim. The privilege is considered to reside with the sitting president \u2013 not any individual who has held the post; hence Biden\u2019s final say on Trump\u2019s claims. And few modern presidents have lodged such high-profile and controversial claims of privilege as Trump, who is trying to prevent the truth about the worst attack on US democracy in generations from coming out.",

            "article_content": "George Washington\u2019s nightmare is coming true. Two disparate events this week \u2013 Steve Bannon\u2019s willingness to risk criminal contempt of Congress to protect a twice-impeached former President and the GOP\u2019s latest move in the Senate blocking efforts to guarantee the rights of all citizens to vote \u2013 are validating the first President\u2019s fear that American democracy would founder on the rocks of partisan extremism. While the American people are weary of the endless partisan fights bequeathed by Donald Trump\u2019s presidency, they are caught in a seminal moment that will decide how America is governed now and for generations to come. House to vote to hold Trump ally Steve Bannon in criminal contempt The Bannon and voting rights cases, which are on a fast boil, underscore how the threat to the US checks and balance system, epitomized by Trump\u2019s election lies and defiance of accountability, is getting worse with every month. And these are not just isolated challenges to the role of Congress and the integrity of the electoral system, but part of a broad and coordinated set of actions that reveal how one of America\u2019s great parties \u2013 the GOP \u2013 is putting the amassing of power and the need to protect and impress a leader with autocratic ambitions above the basic democratic fundamentals. This is exactly what Washington warned against in his 1796 farewell address and threatens to cause the \u201cruins of public liberty\u201d in the political system that he so feared. Republican lawmakers are expected to vote in large numbers on Thursday against a full House effort to hold Bannon, Trump\u2019s former political guru, in criminal contempt for ignoring the House select committee probing the January 6 mob attack on the US Capitol, their very place of work. Their numbers will not be enough in the Democratic-led chamber to prevent the referral being sent to the Justice Department. But the vote will again expose a party in thrall to an ex-President who disrupted a peaceful transition of power. Bannon has made a dubious claim that his conversations with Trump around January 6 are protected by law even though he was not a serving official at the time. He is openly acting on the ex-President\u2019s instructions as Trump claims all his contacts in office are covered by executive privilege. The select committee, however, wants to know what Bannon said to Trump before and during the Capitol insurrection. It also suspects he is a key organizer of protests that turned into a mob attack on Congress \u2013 after he predicted on his podcast the day before that \u201call hell is going to break loose.\u201d It should be no surprise that Bannon is at the center of an attempt to disrupt and clog Washington\u2019s mechanisms for accountability. For most political figures a contempt citation might stain a career, but in the case of this flame-throwing disruptor, it may be seen as the culmination of it. The former Wall Street investment banker was quick to see Trump as the epitome of his own populist, nationalist ideology and worked as a White House official in the early months of his administration. The ex-President\u2019s inept governance only furthered Bannon\u2019s ambition for the \u201cdeconstruction of the administrative state\u201d as it handicapped the regulatory regime he believes liberals use to wield power. But most of all, Bannon likes to watch the elite Washington system metaphorically blow up. So by refusing a subpoena and challenging the authority of Congress itself, he is being true to his long-term political goals, nine months after he was pardoned by Trump in the final hours of his presidency after fraud charges. The House\u2019s criminal referral of Bannon, if it passes as expected, represents one of the last chances for Congress to guard its constitutional oversight powers in relation to Trump\u2019s attempts to tear down the guardrails protecting US democracy. If the GOP wins the House in midterm elections next year, it is expected to close the probe. After the chamber votes, it will ultimately be up to Attorney General Merrick Garland to decide whether to open a criminal case against Bannon. The Justice Department chief will face tough questioning from Republicans on the House Judiciary Committee on the case on Thursday. His position became more delicate last week after President Joe Biden said people like Bannon who defy subpoenas should face the consequences, although the department quickly insisted that such decisions would be taken independently and not subject to politics. The House vote on Bannon will come a day after Senate Republicans used the filibuster, a device not mentioned in the Constitution, to prevent passage of a bill that makes it easier for all Americans to vote and harder to steal elections. The bill would have ruled out many of the restrictions on voting put in place by Republican-run states on the basis of Trump\u2019s election lies. It also expands mail-in voting and would make Election Day a public holiday, so as many people as possible can make it to polling places. Together, the two episodes on either side of the Capitol call into question two basic principles of the American system \u2013 the capacity of a separate coequal branch of government to constrain the presidency and the right to suffrage. Liz Cheney is asking exactly the right question about Bannon, Trump and January 6 And they show how the Republican Party has abdicated its duty to protect those dual pillars of democracy to instead advance its political goals and the interests of an all-powerful individual advancing his own extremist ends. Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney, a rare Republican who has turned against her own party in order to offer an accounting of Trump\u2019s corrupt presidency, warned Wednesday that history would judge Congress poorly unless it held Bannon to account. \u201cIn many nations, democracy has failed because those with authority would not act to protect it because they sat in silence,\u201d Cheney, the vice chair of the select committee, said at a hearing on the contempt citation. \u201cHistory will judge those of us in positions of public trust. Remember that as you cast your votes. As you think about how you will answer when history asks, \u2018What did you do when Congress was attacked?\u2019\u201d That there is even a question whether a political associate of a President who tried to steal an election and whose supporters weaponized his lies to invade the US Capitol to keep him in power should testify, shows how far the threat to US democracy has evolved and why there is doubt whether it can survive. Most House Republicans, who have been steadfast in their attempt to protect Trump from accountability for his abuses of power because they need his support to win power, are expected to vote against the Bannon citation. As is often the case, the ex-President\u2019s supporters accuse his opponents \u2013 in this case the select committee \u2013 of the very transgressions that they are carrying out: politicizing justice and Congress\u2019 duty to oversee the executive branch. \u201cThis whole commission started off as a very partisan exercise. \u2026 You\u2019re seeing most members get tired of the witch hunts and the games,\u201d House Minority Whip Steve Scalise of Louisiana said on Wednesday. Democrats and Republicans had, however, agreed on an independent bipartisan commission to investigate the insurrection, until party leaders reacted to Trump\u2019s angry rejection of the process and killed it off. GOP Rep. Rodney Davis of Illinois, who favored the independent commission, now says that the select committee convening in its place \u201cis a joke and it has been from the beginning.\u201d Several Republicans, however, including some of the 10 who voted to impeach Trump over the Capitol insurrection, say they are undecided on how to vote on Thursday. One of them, Rep. Dan Newhouse of Washington state, said he is considering his options even as party leaders like Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy push for a \u201cno\u201d vote. \u201cI\u2019m still looking at\u2026whether it\u2019s a proper thing for Congress to be doing,\u201d Newhouse said. But Trump\u2019s allies are doing their best to further discredit the House committee and to leave Americans with the impression that its investigation is simply the typical over-politicized shenanigans that stain Washington. Two of them, Reps. Jim Jordan of Ohio and Matt Gaetz of Florida, appeared at a House Rules Committee hearing and fired off combative statements filled with hyper-partisan pro-Trump propaganda. \u201cThis is about setting up people like Steve Bannon and Kevin McCarthy for criminal process,\u201d Gaetz said. \u201cThis is another step along the way to criminalize political activity.\u201d The chairman of the select committee, Mississippi Democrat Bennie Thompson, said Wednesday that if Bannon succeeded, the fundamental role of Congress itself would be in doubt. \u201cThe House cannot let this stand,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cIt would send a signal to Mr Bannon that he can act like he\u2019s above the law and get away with it.\u201d January 6 committee exposes a dark truth in going after Bannon In its report, the committee rejected Bannon\u2019s executive privilege claims. The resolution holding him in contempt alleges that published reports and his own statements suggest he had \u201cspecific knowledge about the events planned for January 6th before they occurred.\u201d It also claims he had multiple roles the investigation needs to know about, including \u201cin constructing and participating in the \u2018stop the steal\u2019 public relations effort that motivated the attack.\u201d According to Washington Post journalists Bob Woodward and Robert Costa in their book \u201cPeril,\u201d Bannon was a key figure in a \u201cwar room\u201d at Washington, DC\u2019s, Willard Hotel, that also included Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani, and that had multiple contacts with the then-President and attempted to pressure then-Vice President Mike Pence to refuse to certify Biden\u2019s election in Congress. Several others members of Trump\u2019s inner orbit have been engaging to some extent with the committee, and the committee has postponed scheduled depositions with Mark Meadows, former chief of staff in the Trump White House, and Kash Patel, a former Defense Department official, while negotiations continue. The panel has given the ex-President\u2019s deputy chief of staff Dan Scavino extra time to respond to his subpoenas, after his lawyer said he was not yet ready to cooperate. The long-winded efforts to enforce testimony \u2013 and attempts to stretch out the clock by witnesses like Bannon \u2013 mean it remains far from clear whether the panel will hold Trump to account in this potentially final effort.",

            "article_content": "The US court system is creating some accountability for hundreds of the people who attended the January 6 rally, which turned into the insurrection at the US Capitol, by charging them with criminal offenses and in some cases sending them to jail. The political system reveals a much less clear effort to hold accountable the people who instigated the whole event. Democratic lawmakers are set with a Thursday vote to hold former President Donald Trump\u2019s ex-adviser Steve Bannon in criminal contempt of Congress because he won\u2019t comply with a subpoena in their January 6 investigation. Trump is also ignoring Congress by asking the National Archives to squash congressional requests for documents related to the insurrection. What comes after the contempt vote? It is entirely unclear whether that contempt vote will lead to any action by the Justice Department to pursue charges. Related: What is criminal contempt? There would be some irony in a Democratic administration not pursuing criminal contempt charges brought by a Democratic Congress. Look for some clarity when Attorney General Merrick Garland testifies at an oversight hearing in front of the House Judiciary Committee on Thursday. Garland has, on the one hand, promised to keep politics out of the Justice Department. He has, on the other, a duty to uphold the law, including Congress\u2019 right to compel testimony. The root is a lack of respect for Congress. The unwillingness of Trump aides like Dan Scavino and others who are just simpatico with Trump like Bannon is a problem for the fact-finding element of January 6 investigation. That they feel entitled to ignore congressional subpoenas is a much deeper problem \u2013 a glitch in the system of checks an balances. What comes next? A slow court fight. Related: Trump\u2019s best legal shot at blocking the release of his January 6 docs A system of checks and balances is being ignored. The January 6 investigation is slowly uncovering, for the umpteenth time of the Trump era, one of the major flaws \u2013 frustration might be a better word \u2013 with the US system of government. There should be checks and balances between the branches of government, which are meant to share power. Liz Cheney: Bannon refusal to cooperate suggests Trump was 'personally involved' in planning January 6 Congress legislates. The President executes. The courts settle disputes. They\u2019re interdependent and yet distinct. It\u2019s meant to be an elegant knot. Ticking clock. Congress, which is the branch of government most accountable to voters, faces an election in a little more than a year, which seems like an eternity but is perhaps not nearly enough time to force Trump or his cronies to cooperate using the courts. Beyond the subpoena fight and the contempt question is something even more central for a modern society that prides itself as a free and open democracy that does not make political prisoners. What is the appropriate accountability for a President who tried to stage a coup? Trump has already faced informal accountability. His coup failed. He\u2019s been driven off social media. He avoided formal accountability. Trump\u2019s party saved him conviction in an impeachment trial, which means he can run for President again. The last laugh may be on the Republicans who didn\u2019t end his career when they had the chance if, as expected, he does run again in 2024. He has claimed ignorance of the insurrection, something his supporters can cling to. But hiding his papers and testimony of his enablers should undermine him. \u201cMr. Bannon\u2019s and Mr. Trump\u2019s privilege arguments do appear to reveal one thing, however: they suggest that President Trump was personally involved in the planning and execution of January 6th,\u201d said Rep. Liz Cheney, one of a handful of House Republicans who supported Trump\u2019s impeachment and broke with the vast majority of Republicans to take part in the January 6 investigation. \u201cAnd we will get to the bottom of that,\u201d she added as the January 6 committee pushed the contempt question to the full Congress. What comes after the committee? While the necessity of getting to the bottom of exactly what happened seems essential, the end game is not at all clear. There is the promise of politically damaging Trump as he plots another run for the White House. History as a guide. In fact, while trying to overturn an election is a crime against democracy, there\u2019s a long history of the US not punishing political criminals in a way that Trump haters would be satisfied with. Aaron Burr escaped after killing Alexander Hamilton in the famous duel. Out in the western wilderness, he encouraged western states to leave the union and join him in an effort to take land from Spain with help fro England. With some help from Chief Justice John Marshall, Burr beat the treason rap. Richard Nixon escaped formal accountability after Watergate, but he found himself in a wilderness of his own. Many of his enablers were charged with crimes, in particular after his White House counsel, John Dean, turned on his boss \u2013 at a hearing on Capitol Hill. Trump\u2019s aides aren\u2019t likely to do that since Bannon, and perhaps Scavino, are simply ignoring subpoenas. Trump is no Nixon. Nixon resigned after he lost the faith of senators in his party. Trump kept Republicans in line to protect him from impeachment. He still does. Look at his embrace by longtime Republicans formerly known for their backbone, like Sen. Charles Grassley, who admitted perhaps too much when he said he wouldn\u2019t be very smart to dismiss the endorsement of a person as popular in the party as the former President. Trump\u2019s influence also wanes. Republicans are looking to win the governor\u2019s race in Virginia next month. The GOP candidate Glenn Youngkin has offered some coded references to his support for \u201celection integrity,\u201d but contra to the idea that Trump controls the party, he has largely kept the former President\u2019s name out of speeches. Republican candidates can ignore Trump -- but he won't go away The current conventional wisdom is that if this election in Virginia turns on angry parents frustrated with how Covid-19 has been handled in schools, Younkin has a good shot at upsetting Democratic former Gov. Terry McAuliffe. If it\u2019s still about the Trump path the GOP has been on, he\u2019ll lose. Similarly, Sen. Mitch McConnell, the top Republican in the Senate, made very clear \u2013 or as clear as he\u2019s likely to make it \u2013 that GOP candidates should be focusing on their criticisms of the Biden administration and not their defense of the Trump election fantasy. At least, that\u2019s what I think McConnell said. Here are his actual words: Asked by CNN\u2019s Manu Raju whether he was comfortable with candidates embracing Trump, McConnell said this: \u201cI do think we need to be thinking about the future and not the past. I think the American people are focusing on this administration, what it\u2019s doing to the country, and it\u2019s my hope the \u201922 election will be a referendum on the performance of the current administration, not a rehash of suggestions about what may have happened in 2020.\u201d (Note: The vast majority of Republicans have either endorsed, failed to condemn, or developed amnesia about Trump\u2019s election fantasies.) That they could allow, abet or accept the effort to overthrow the election should, you\u2019d think, be disqualifying. But that\u2019s not the way any of this works. We\u2019re in a situation where history suggests a majority of Americans will vote in 2022 in favor of a political party that tried to undermine an election. While the voters wouldn\u2019t specifically be voting for Trump in 2022, the end result of a Republican victory is that the House investigation would surely go away.",

            "article_content": "Republican Rep. Liz Cheney blasted former President Donald Trump\u2019s ally Steve Bannon for refusing to cooperate with the House committee investigating the January 6 riot, saying that his claim of executive privilege is not only invalid, but suggests Trump was \u201cpersonally involved\u201d in the planning and execution of the events that day. While the committee has yet to provide evidence directly linking the former President to those efforts, Cheney\u2019s comments reflect a suspicion among members of the panel that Trump is attempting to conceal certain communications that may be incriminating. \u201cMr. Bannon\u2019s and Mr. Trump\u2019s privilege arguments do appear to reveal one thing, however: they suggest that President Trump was personally involved in the planning and execution of January 6th,\u201d Cheney said. \u201cAnd we will get to the bottom of that,\u201d she added. On Wednesday, Democratic Rep. Bennie Thompson of Mississippi, the committee\u2019s chairman, expanded on what Cheney meant when she said that evidence suggests that Trump was \u201cpersonally involved in the planning and execution of January 6.\u201d \u201cI think \u2018plan\u2019 is a relative,\u201d Thompson told CNN when asked about Cheney\u2019s comments the night before. \u201cThere\u2019s no question he tweeted about it in the very beginning,\u201d he said. \u201cThe majority of the people in this country didn\u2019t know what January 6 was all about when he did it. He created the narrative up to the point. Planned the rally \u2013 and obviously he said, you need to go to the Hill and let people know you don\u2019t like what\u2019s going on. \u201cSo, people left the rally that he had invited them to,\u201d Thompson added. \u201cAnd they came to the Hill. And the rest we saw in our own eyes.\u201d Cheney\u2019s remarks came during Tuesday night\u2019s at a crucial meeting of the January 6 committee where they approved a criminal contempt report of Bannon, setting up for a vote from the full House of Representatives on Thursday. Cheney, the vice chair of the committee and a frequent critic of Trump, is one of two Republicans on the nine-member panel. Cheney and Thompson said during Tuesday\u2019s meeting that the panel believes Bannon has significant knowledge of the planning around the attack and reiterated that they expect the Department of Justice to prosecute once the House formally votes on a criminal referral. Trump sues to keep White House records secret, claiming executive privilege \u201cBased on the Committee\u2019s investigation, it appears that Mr. Bannon had substantial advance knowledge of the plans for January 6th and likely had an important role in formulating those plans,\u201d Cheney said. \u201cThe day before this all occurred \u2014 on January 5th \u2014 Mr. Bannon publicly professed knowledge that \u2018(a)ll hell is going to break lose tomorrow.\u2019 He forecast that the day would be \u2018extraordinarily different\u2019 than what most Americans expected. He said to his viewers on the air: \u2018(S)o many people said, \u201cif I was in a revolution, I would be in Washington.\u201d\u2019 (W)ell, this is your time in history,\u201d she added. Select Committee member Rep. Adam Schiff, a California Democrat, would not comment when asked Tuesday if Cheney was insinuating that the committee believes Trump and Bannon may have conspired to plan and execute the January 6 riot but acknowledged Bannon\u2019s testimony may be essential to understanding the former President\u2019s role. \u201c(Bannon) was reportedly in communication with the President in proximity the sixth, and multiple communications with the White House leading up to that day. The biggest \u2026 unknowns about January 6 go to the President\u2019s role before during and after, and, and we\u2019re determined to find out,\u201d he told reporters. Testifying before the House Rules Committee on Wednesday, Cheney also elaborated on the panel\u2019s interest in learning more about how the planning for January 6 and how Trump\u2019s language contributed to the violence. \u201cIt\u2019s critically important for us to recognize and understand how the language that the president, President Trump continues to use to this day, sparked what we saw happen on the sixth. There\u2019s a much larger story that we need to understand about exactly what the plans were for that day they went so far beyond the President\u2019s legitimate right to challenge the results of the election through our court system,\u201d she said. Bannon and his lawyer have argued that he is unable to cooperate with the committee until matters of executive privilege are resolved by the courts, but the committee has made clear the panel believes his \u201cwillful refusal to comply with the Subpoena constitutes a violation of federal law.\u201d The contempt report, which was released Monday night, outlines the efforts the committee made to get a witness to comply with the subpoena, and the failure by the witness to do so. Any individual who is found liable for contempt of Congress would be guilty of a crime that may result in a fine and between one and 12 months\u2019 imprisonment. But this process is rarely invoked and rarely leads to jail time \u2013 though the House\u2019s pursuit of criminal charges may be more about making an example out of Bannon and sending a message to other potential witnesses. This story and headline have been updated with additional developments Wednesday. CNN\u2019s Manu Raju contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "At a meeting of the House select committee investigating the January 6 riot at the US Capitol, Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney, a Republican and vice chair of the committee, said something very, very important about both Donald Trump and his former political svengali Steve Bannon. Here it is: \u201cBased on the committee\u2019s investigation, it appears that Mr. Bannon had substantial advance knowledge of the plans for January 6 and likely had an important role in formulating those plans. Mr. Bannon was in the war room at the Willard on January 6. He also appears to have detailed knowledge regarding the president\u2019s efforts to sell millions of Americans the fraud that the election was stolen\u2026Mr. Bannon\u2019s and Mr. Trump\u2019s privilege arguments do however appear to reveal one thing: They suggest that President Trump was personally involved in the planning and execution of January 6. And this committee will get to the bottom of that.\u201d Liz Cheney addresses GOP colleagues about January 6 Which, well, whoa! What Cheney is saying is that the actions of late taken by Bannon and Trump \u2013 both have cited executive privilege for their refusal to cooperate with the committee\u2019s requests for information \u2013 are, in and of themselves, suggestions that both men did things in the run-up to the riot at the US Capitol (and on the day of the insurrection) they are trying to hide. Democratic Rep. Bennie Thompson, who chairs the committee, said this on Wednesday afternoon: \u201cI think \u2018plan\u2019 is relative. There\u2019s no question [Trump] tweeted about it in the very beginning. The majority of the people in this country didn\u2019t know what January 6 was all about when he did it. He created the narrative up to the point. Planned the rally \u2013 and obviously he said, you need to go to the Hill and let people know you don\u2019t like what\u2019s going on.\u201d And Cheney also said this Wednesday before the House Rules Committee: \u201cIt\u2019s critically important for us to recognize and understand how the language that the (former) President, President Trump continues to use to this day, sparked what we saw happen on the sixth. There\u2019s a much larger story that we need to understand about exactly what the plans were for that day they went so far beyond the President\u2019s legitimate right to challenge the results of the election through our court system.\u201d Let\u2019s remember what we know about the actions of Trump and Bannon \u2013 both on January 6 and the days leading up to it. Trump spoke to the \u201cStop the Steal\u201d rally that morning, telling attendees that \u201cwe fight like hell. And if you don\u2019t fight like hell, you\u2019re not going to have a country anymore.\u201d He then returned to the White House. And as CNN noted the day after the riot: \u201cOnly after pleading from aides and Congressional allies inside the besieged Capitol building did Trump release a taped video urging the mass of his supporters \u2013 many carrying Trump flags or wearing Trump paraphernalia \u2013 to \u2018go home,\u2019 while still fanning their misplaced grievances about a stolen election.\u201d Trump\u2019s statement, in retrospect, was even worse than it appeared at the time. \u201cThis was a fraudulent election, but we can\u2019t play into the hands of these people,\u201d Trump said on a day that would lead to five people killed and more than 100 police officers wounded. \u201cWe have to have peace. So go home. We love you; you\u2019re very special.\u201d (Sidebar: More than 600 people have been charged with crimes for their actions that day.) THE POINT -- NOW ON YOUTUBE! \nIn each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe! As for Bannon, he was knee-deep in January 6. As authors Bob Woodward and Robert Costa recount in their book \u201cPeril\u201d: \u201c\u2018You\u2019ve got to call Pence off the [expletive] ski slopes and get him back here today. This is a crisis.\u2019 Bannon said, referring to the vice president who was vacationing in Vail, Colorado. \u201cBannon told Trump to focus on January 6. That was the moment for a reckoning. \u201c\u2018People are going to go \u2018What the [expletive] is going on here?\u2019 Bannon believed. \u2018We\u2019re going to bury Biden on January 6th, [expletive] bury him.\u2019 \u201cIf Republicans could cast enough of a shadow on Biden\u2019s victory on January 6, Bannon said, it would be hard for Biden to govern. Millions of Americans would consider him illegitimate. They would ignore him. They would dismiss him and wait for Trump to run again. \u201c\u2018We are going to kill it in the crib. Kill the Biden presidency in the crib,\u2019 he said.\u201d And in the wake of the January 6 insurrection, Mark Milley, the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, invoked Bannon in trying to understand the origins of that day. \u201cIt was a planned revolution,\u201d Woodward and Costa wrote. \u201cSteve Bannon\u2019s vision coming to life. Bring it all down, blow it up, burn it, and emerge with power.\u201d Bannon, speaking on his \u201cWar Room\u201d podcast in late September, confirmed that had huddled with Trump to plot a way to fundamentally undermine the Biden presidency on January 6 and even sort-of declared victory. \u201cIt killed itself,\u201d Bannon said of the Biden presidency, according to an account in Newsweek. \u201cJust look at what this illegitimate regime is doing. It killed itself. OK? But we told you from the very beginning, just expose it, just expose it, never back down, never give up and this thing will implode.\u201d Make note then of what Cheney said on Tuesday night: The very fact that Trump and Bannon are trying to invoke executive privilege over what they said and did both on January 6 and in the days leading up to it suggests that the then-President was \u201cpersonally involved in the planning and execution of January 6.\u201d That is a VERY big deal.

            "article_content": "The January 6 committee\u2019s anticipated vote on Tuesday citing Steve Bannon for criminal contempt of Congress may be one of the last chances for lawmakers to seek meaningful consequences for former President Donald Trump\u2019s attempt to effectively stage a coup. After multiple and historic attempts to hold Trump to account for abuses of power \u2013 including two impeachments \u2013 failed to check his aberrant behavior, the rare move to try to enforce testimony from Bannon is intended to send a stern message to other allies of the former President whom the committee wants to question. What is at stake is nothing less than the ability of a separate, co-equal branch of government to hold the presidency to account now and in future generations. The inquiry became even more critical Monday, after Trump sued in District Court in Washington, DC, to keep secret records from his presidency that the Biden administration has declined to protect for him, rejecting his claims of executive privilege. Lawyers for the former President, who refused to accept his free and fair election defeat and who incited a mob that invaded the US Capitol seeking to stop the certification of President Joe Biden\u2019s victory, made the outlandish claim that the committee \u2013 rather than Trump \u2013 was \u201cattempting to damage the republic itself and the citizens of the United States.\u201d READ: The January 6 committee's criminal contempt report on Steve Bannon It is far from the first time that the ex-President has sought to cover up his own behind-the-scenes behavior during the most flagrant challenge to US democracy of modern times. His latest obstruction offensive raises the obvious question of what exactly Trump and his acolytes are trying to cover up about the attempt to prevent a peaceful transfer of power and to steal an election that he lost. But his suppression of information and flurries of legal action are also familiar after four years of an administration that refused any accountability and that made a mockery of Congress\u2019 constitutional oversight duty. The potential criminal contempt filing against Bannon is intended not just to force the firebrand prophet of Trump-style populism to testify about his conversations with the former President in the days around January 6. It\u2019s a principled stand since Bannon\u2019s refusal to show up after being subpoenaed would potentially create a precedent that would shatter Congress\u2019 capacity to investigate any executive branch officials or othes, even those not related to Trump. Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff of California told CNN on Sunday that the contempt filing was designed to prove the investigation has teeth, and as a warning to other witnesses tempted to bow to Trump\u2019s efforts to scupper it. \u201cThe fact that if the Justice Department prosecutes Steve Bannon, other witnesses will see they will face real consequences including jail time and potentially stiff fines. That is a way of getting people\u2019s attention,\u201d Schiff, a member of the select committee, told CNN\u2019s Jim Acosta on \u201cNewsroom.\u201d \u201cBannon\u2019s an important witness in his own right, but it\u2019s also important to send a message that the rule of law is back and people are going to need to pay attention.\u201d The immediate audience for that message is other key Trump associates who have been subpoenaed already. They include Kash Patel, a former senior Pentagon official; Mark Meadows, Trump\u2019s final White House chief of staff; and Dan Scavino, former deputy chief of staff. The January 6 panel is Democratic-led but includes two Republicans \u2013 Reps. Liz Cheney of Wyoming and Adam Kinzinger of Illinois \u2013 who broke ranks and condemned Trump\u2019s behavior. The committee was empaneled by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi after House and Senate Republican leaders, keen to ride Trump\u2019s popularity with GOP base voters in the midterm elections, thwarted a bipartisan agreement for an independent commission into the insurrection. The Republican obstruction underscored how Congress\u2019 capacity to investigate and restrain a wild presidency can be rendered very difficult when a party protects its own leader for partisan reasons and covers up his abuses of power. When the committee votes to hold Bannon in criminal contempt, the full Democratic-controlled House will next have to follow suit and refer the matter to the US attorney for DC. Ultimately, it will be up to the Justice Department, under Attorney General Merrick Garland, to decide whether to prosecute. Setting the stage for Tuesday\u2019s meeting, the committee sent a letter to Bannon\u2019s lawyer that dismissed his claim that his conversations with Trump are covered by executive privilege. The protection is usually claimed by presidents to allow them to receive confidential advice from officials. But many legal experts view Bannon\u2019s strategy as dubious since he left the White House in 2017 and had no formal role at the time of the insurrection. And committee members want to talk to Bannon about any contacts with organizers of the insurrection in January, quite apart from his talks with Trump. And while ex-presidents have some recourse to executive privilege, final adjudications are left to the sitting president if they disagree. Bannon\u2019s lawyer had previously argued that his client was not defying the committee but was simply complying with an instruction by Trump to go along with his effort to defend executive privilege. But the committee said in its letter that the ex-President had not communicated any assertion of privilege to the committee. And it described the notion that the concept protects Trump\u2019s conversations with Bannon as \u201cunsupported.\u201d And White House Deputy Counsel Jonathan Su wrote to Bannon attorney Robert Costello, saying that the Biden administration will not support his attempt to refuse to cooperate with the select committee on the grounds of executive privilege. The showdown between Bannon and the committee has the potential to be the opening shot in a protracted legal battle that looks increasingly like a ruse to not just thwart the investigation but to delay its deliberations for as long as possible. If Republicans reclaim the House majority in next year\u2019s congressional elections, a distinct possibility given the tough history of midterms for first-term presidents, a new GOP speaker in thrall to Trump would almost certainly shut down the investigation.   So turning enforcement requests from Congress into a parade of court hearings, judgments, appeals and obstruction tactics could not only infuriate the committee members, it could run out the clock for the committee itself. With that in mind, Committee Chair Bennie Thompson, a Democrat from Mississippi, and Cheney, the panel\u2019s vice chair, issued a joint statement on Monday evening warning they would fight any attempt by Trump to slow the process down. \u201cThe former President\u2019s clear objective is to stop the Select Committee from getting to the facts about January 6th and his lawsuit is nothing more than an attempt to delay and obstruct our probe. Precedent and law are on our side,\u201d they wrote. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to imagine a more compelling public interest than trying to get answers about an attack on our democracy and an attempt to overturn the results of an election.\u201d The unusual nature of the confrontation \u2013 over a former President exerting privilege on his own behalf even after he has left office \u2013 could also lead to a seminal constitutional argument about deference due to ex-presidents and the scope of executive privilege once they have left office. An aggressive pro-Trump partisan like Bannon may also welcome the chance to turn the legal battle into a political cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre. Conservatives who brand the entire effort as an attempt to victimize the ex-President got some unexpected help last week when Biden agreed that people who refuse subpoenas should face the consequences. The comment broke with the President\u2019s disciplined practice of avoiding any semblance of political interference with the Justice Department, which was repeatedly pressured by Trump to go along with his political vendettas. The department and the White House quickly vowed that decisions on Bannon and others would be approached purely on legal grounds. But the exchanges reflected the extreme pressure on Garland, who effectively holds the destiny of the January 6 probe in his hands. There is also a question of whether the committee, once it has moved ahead with the Bannon criminal contempt citation, will go after other senior figures around the ex-President \u2013 and perhaps even Trump himself. Hauling a former president before the committee for a deposition would likely cause a spectacle and its members may not wish to create a precedent. Kinzinger, speaking on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d on Sunday, held out the prospect of action against Trump but recognized those constraints. \u201cIf we subpoena all of a sudden the former President, we know that\u2019s going to become kind of a circus so that\u2019s not necessarily something we want to do up front,\u201d the Illinois Republican said. \u201cBut if he has pieces of information we need, we certainly will.\u201d In his filing to the DC District Court on Monday, the former President argued that committee requests for Trump-era documents currently held by the National Archives were too broad, included information subject to executive privilege and that the Presidential Records Act was unconstitutional. The suit also claims the committee subpoena has no legislative purpose. Lawmakers, however, say they need to investigate January 6 to see whether any new laws are necessary to stop anything similar from happening ever again. Trump\u2019s team lashed out at his successor in the court filing, calling Biden\u2019s failure to protect the documents a \u201cpolitical ploy to accommodate his partisan allies.\u201d Another member of the committee, Rep. Zoe Lofgren \u2013 a veteran of the Watergate investigations \u2013 dismissed Trump\u2019s suit. \u201cI don\u2019t think it is well founded but the former President, we know, is someone who likes to sue a lot. He has engaged in frivolous lawsuits throughout his life,\u201d the California Democrat told CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer on \u201cThe Situation Room.\u201d But Trump did face a day in court \u2013 of a sort \u2013 on Monday. The former President answered questions for about four and a half hours in a deposition as part of a lawsuit brought by men alleging they were assaulted by his security team during a demonstration outside Trump Tower in New York in 2015. \u201cHe answered the questions. Whether or not it was satisfactory, I think we will leave up to a jury in this matter,\u201d Benjamin Dictor, attorney for the men who filed the 2015 lawsuit, told CNN\u2019s Erin Burnett on Monday. \u201cHe put his right hand in the air and he took an oath to tell the truth and that is the first time that that has happened since, well, before he was elected president. And that is a really meaningful thing.\u201d Paula Reid, Katelyn Polantz, Tierney Sneed, Marshall Cohen and Ryan Nobles contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "The committee investigating the January 6 riot at the US Capitol has released its contempt report on former President Donald Trump ally Steve Bannon, a document that outlines the efforts the committee took to get Bannon to comply with its subpoena \u2013 and the failure by him to do so. This report is the subject of a Tuesday business meeting to be held by the committee, which marks the first step in a series of moves that needs to be taken in order to move forward with holding Bannon in criminal contempt for not complying with the subpoena. The criminal contempt report lays out all the correspondence between the committee and Bannon, revealing new details about what happened the day of his scheduled deposition and making his full subpoena publicly available for the first time. Throughout the report, the committee makes the case for why Bannon\u2019s claim of executive privilege does not hold up and lays out the legal argument for why he must comply with the subpoena. Trump sues to keep White House records secret, claiming executive privilege \u201cMr. Bannon has relied on no legal authority to support his refusal to comply in any fashion with the subpoena,\u201d the report states. The committee starts out by noting that executive privilege has not been officially invoked, and that there has been no communication with Trump over its invocation. \u201cThe Select Committee has not been provided with any formal invocation of executive privilege by the President, the former President or any other employee of the executive branch,\u201d the report says. The committee also argues that Bannon was a private citizen during the period in which it is seeking information. \u201cThe law is clear,\u201d the report states, \u201cthat executive privilege does not extend to discussions between the President and private citizens relating to non-governmental business or among private citizens.\u201d The report adds that \u201cat no point during the time period under investigation by the Select Committee was Mr. Bannon a government employee, much less a key White House adviser in the Office of the President.\u201d The committee also argues that much of what it is seeking from Bannon does not involve his conversations with Trump and therefore should not be shielded. The report provides a detailed accounting of the select committee\u2019s requests for documents and communications dating to April 1, 2020. The subpoena lists 17 key areas of investigation and specifically directs Bannon to produce any permits and documents related to planning, financing, objectives and communications for the pro-Trump January 6 rally on the National Mall and Capitol complex grounds. The requested documents include correspondence with former Trump aide Boris Epshteyn; copies of his podcasts in which he discusses false claims of election fraud or the rally; communications with Trump regarding January 6 and \u2013 more specifically \u2013 communications the two may have had on December 30; and communications with key Trump allies such as John Eastman, Jenna Ellis, Michael Flynn, Sidney Powell and Rudy Giuliani. READ: The January 6 committee's criminal contempt report on Steve Bannon The committee asks Bannon to provide any communications with far-right extremist groups the Proud Boys, the Oath Keepers and Three Percenters, as well as InfoWars creator Alex Jones. On October 7, seven hours after Bannon was to provide documents to the committee, the report outlines that Bannon\u2019s lawyer, Robert J. Costello, sent a letter to the committee explaining that his client refused to comply with the committee\u2019s subpoena. Costello cited a letter from Trump\u2019s counsel, Justin Clark, that instructed Bannon to not comply with the subpoena until a deal on executive privilege had been worked out. \u201cThe two-page letter contained only conclusory statements, no legal analysis, and approximately half of it purported to quote from the letter of October 6, 2021, from the counsel to Mr. Trump,\u201d the contempt report states. On October 13, the report outlines that committee staff reached out to Costello via email to discuss logistics for Bannon\u2019s deposition the following day. An hour later, staff and Costello spoke by phone and Costello informed the committee \u2013 ahead of the letter that was publicly released \u2013 that his client would not be appearing for a deposition. January 6 committee rejects Bannon's executive privilege claim in new letter Costello\u2019s letter to the panel stated that his client will not provide testimony or documents until the committee reaches an agreement with Trump over executive privilege or a court weighs in on the matter. The report addresses the letter, saying: \u201cMr. Costello\u2019s October 13th letter merely states that the attorney for former President Trump had informed him that \u2018President Trump is exercising his executive privilege.\u2019 This third-hand, non-specific assertion of privilege, without any description of the documents or testimony over which privilege is claimed, is insufficient to activate a claim of executive privilege.\u201d On October 14, the day of Bannon\u2019s scheduled deposition, committee staff and members including Rep. Adam Schiff and Senior Investigative Counsel Sean Tonolli, gathered at 10 a.m. and adjourned six minutes later when it was clear that Bannon was not going to appear. The report includes a transcript of that short meeting, during which Tonolli recaps what the correspondence with Bannon had been up until that point. On October 15, according to the report, committee chairman Bennie Thompson sent a letter to Costello informing him that the committee planned to move forward with a criminal contempt referral, that Bannon does not have immunity from testifying and that Bannon had not attempted to provide any explanation for his refusal to provide documents unrelated to his communications with Trump. If the report is adopted out of committee on Tuesday, it is then referred to the House. If the vote succeeds, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi certifies the report to the United States attorney for the District of Columbia. Under law, this certification then requires the United States attorney to \u201cbring the matter before the grand jury for its action,\u201d but the Justice Department will also makes its own determinations for prosecuting. Any individual who is found liable for contempt of Congress is then guilty of a crime that may result in a fine and between one and 12 months imprisonment. But this process is rarely invoked and rarely leads to jail time. January 6 investigators are talking about criminal contempt charges for ignored subpoenas. Here's what that means. As severe as a criminal contempt referral sounds, the House\u2019s choice to use the Justice Department may be more of a warning shot than a solution. Holding Bannon in criminal contempt through a prosecution could take years, and historic criminal contempt cases have been derailed by appeals and acquittals. Democratic Rep. Elaine Luria of Virginia, who is one of the lawmakers serving on the committee, outlined that the ultimate goal of pursuing criminal contempt with Bannon is to get him to testify. \u201cOur goal is to have him testify. I think that this will send a strong message that there are consequences for not testifying,\u201d Luria told CNN on Friday. \u201cHis testimony is very important for the committee.\u201d Last week, Thompson detailed the panel\u2019s intent to pursue criminal contempt of Bannon. \u201cMr. Bannon has declined to cooperate with the Select Committee and is instead hiding behind the former President\u2019s insufficient, blanket, and vague statements regarding privileges he has purported to invoke,\u201d the Mississippi Democrat said in a statement on Thursday. This story has been updated with additional details from the report.",

            "article_content": "The committee investigating the January 6 attack on the US Capitol had a big week. Key decisions were made that not only cemented the tone of how the committee has chosen to operate, but also brought future roadblocks further into focus. Here\u2019s what last week tells us about the investigation: When Trump ally Steve Bannon made clear he was not going to comply with his subpoena, the committee moved swiftly to take a critical step towards holding him in criminal contempt. \u201cThe Select Committee will not tolerate defiance of our subpoenas, so we must move forward with proceedings to refer Mr. Bannon for criminal contempt,\u201d Democratic Rep. Bennie Thompson, a Mississippi Democrat who serves as the chair of the committee said in a statement on Thursday. Bannon was advertising his opposition to the committee in the days leading up to his scheduled deposition. His lawyer wrote a letter to the committee saying that Bannon will not be providing testimony or documents until the committee reaches an agreement with former President Donald Trump over executive privilege or a court weighs in on the matter. \u201cThat is an issue between the committee and President Trump\u2019s counsel and Mr. Bannon is not required to respond at this time,\u201d his attorney Robert Costello wrote the day before Bannon was set to testify. The committee\u2019s decision to officially move forward with criminal contempt on Bannon underscores how it views criminal contempt as a tool to expedite getting the information they need to move forward with their investigation, or at least showing there are consequences for witnesses that don\u2019t cooperate. \u201cWe think Steve Bannon has information that is germane to what happened on January 6th, and if he refuses the subpoena like we expect him to do, then we are left with no other choice then to ask the Department of Justice to lock him up, hold him in contempt, and clearly that might send enough of a message that he will agree to talk to us,\u201d Thompson added. What is executive privilege? Does a former president still get it? But even though the committee is officially moving forward with criminal contempt on Bannon, there is still a long process that needs to play out. The committee will meet on Tuesday where it will adopt a contempt report, which outlines the efforts the committee made to get a witness to comply with the subpoena, and the failure by the witness to do so. This report is then referred to the House for a vote. If the vote succeeds, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi certifies the report to the United States attorney for the District of Columbia. Under law, this certification then requires the United States attorney to \u201cbring the matter before the grand jury for its action,\u201d but the Justice Department will also makes its own determinations for prosecuting. The case then heads to trial. Any individual who is convicted of contempt of Congress is then guilty of a crime that may result in a fine and between one and 12 months imprisonment. But this process is rarely invoked, and rarely leads to jail time. As severe as a criminal contempt referral sounds, the House\u2019s choice to use the Justice Department may be more of a warning shot than a solution. Holding Bannon in criminal contempt through a prosecution could take years, and historic criminal contempt cases have been derailed by appeals and acquittals. The committee has a few options at their disposal when it comes to handling individuals who defy their subpoenas. But members on the committee made clear last week that they are unified in believing that criminal contempt is their best and fastest option. Thompson described the criminal contempt route as getting the committee what they need \u201cin the shortest period of time\u201d on CNN\u2019s \u201cThe Situation Room.\u201d \u201cIf the negotiations fail, then we will not hesitate one bit on moving on a criminal or civil referral on this matter,\u201d Thompson added, describing the committee\u2019s perspective more generally. And Thompson said the moves the committee made on Bannon are just the beginning when it comes to how the committee will deal with those who do not cooperate. \u201cJust as we are pursuing the criminal contempt on Steve Bannon, it is just the beginning,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cYou will see more of this type of work coming.\u201d Thompson also made clear that no one is off limits to be subpoenaed, including Trump himself. \u201cIf former President Trump thinks he can get away with what happened on January the 6th by being cute with his press releases, then he has another thing coming\u201d Thompson said Thursday. \u201cHis attempt to deflect our work will not work,\u201d Thompson added. \u201cI assure the public that at the end of the day the committee expects full cooperation from everyone that we subpoenaed.\u201d US Capitol Police officer indicted on obstruction of justice charges in connection with January 6 Even before the committee took official action on Bannon, members were telegraphing their belief that criminal contempt should be the next step for anyone who defies a subpoena. \u201cI think we are completely of one mind that if people refuse to respond to questions, refuse to produce documents without justification that we will hold them in criminal contempt and refer them to the Justice Department,\u201d Rep. Adam Schiff, a California Democrat and committee member, told CNN earlier in the week. Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming, one of two Republicans on the panel, echoed that sentiment, telling CNN, \u201cthe committee is completely in solidarity\u201d on the decision to move quickly on pursuing criminal contempt charges for those who evade subpoena deadlines. \u201cPeople will have the opportunity to cooperate, they will have the opportunity to come in and work with us as they should,\u201d Cheney said. \u201cIf they fail to do so, then we\u2019ll enforce our subpoenas.\u201d On top of the limitations Congress has to enforce subpoenas, the committee is also running into road blocks with where the lines of executive privilege are going to be drawn. So far, the committee is seeking documents from the Trump presidency that are held by the National Archives \u2013 and so far the Biden White House hasn\u2019t attempted to keep any confidential. But Trump\u2019s legal team plans to try to keep about 40 records in the archives confidential by claiming the former President can assert executive privilege. Courts haven\u2019t completely decided how much say Trump can have, and he does have an opportunity to sue in the coming weeks. And with this shaping up to be a showdown between Trump and the Biden White House, the timing of these legal battles could weigh heavily on the fast approaching midterm elections with the committee investigating January 6 getting stuck in the political cross hairs. Biden refuses to assert privilege over Trump documents sought by January 6 committee Trump indicated last week that he will try to assert executive privilege to prevent the committee from getting information from certain witnesses. On Wednesday, the White House formally rejected that request to assert executive privilege to shield from lawmakers a subset of documents that the committee had requested, and set an aggressive timeline for their release. The letter sent Friday from White House counsel Dana Remus to Archivist of the United States David Ferriero requests that the documents be released \u201c30 days after your notification to the former President, absent any intervening court order.\u201d Schiff reacted to the decision from the White House on CNN, stating, \u201cI think it\u2019s very, very positive that the Biden administration recognizes that these are unique circumstances.\u201d As part of their sweeping investigation, the committee has sent requests to a number of government agencies including the National Archives, which is the custodian of the Trump administration White House records. The committee has asked for \u201call documents and communications within the White House\u201d on that day, including call logs, schedules and meetings with top officials and outside advisers, including Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani. The result of these deliberations between Trump\u2019s legal team and the Biden White House will determine what information the committee gets access to. On Thursday, Thompson said on CNN that the committee had not heard directly from the former president\u2019s legal team outside of public statements. And Thompson conceded that the deliberations over executive privilege will determine what the committee is able to find out. \u201cI appreciate the White House agreement to look at executive privilege and give us consideration on a lot of the information we want. A lot of what we decide on former President Trump is dependent on what we find in this information,\u201d Thompson said. These deliberations, as Thompson described it on Thursday, are \u201ckind of cumbersome.\u201d Last week, the committee also subpoenaed Jeffrey Clark, a Justice Department official who was integral to helping Trump in his efforts to overturn the 2020 presidential election, the committee announced Wednesday. Clark, a Trump-appointed environment law chief at the Justice Department, has become a major figure in the emerging narrative about behind-the-scenes efforts by Trump and his closest allies to orchestrate a leadership coup at the Justice Department and peddle lies about election fraud. Thompson described the testimony from Clark on CNN as \u201cvery essential,\u201d adding \u201cwe need to hear from him.\u201d On the same day the committee issued its subpoena to Clark, it also held an in-person meeting with former acting Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen that lasted about eight hours, according to a person familiar with the matter. Rosen served in the role during the final days of the Trump administration. Top conservative lawyers steer clear of Trump's latest legal fight Both moves underscore that the panel is interested in learning more about how Trump attempted to pressure top officials to investigate claims of election fraud during the former President\u2019s final days in office \u2013 an issue the committee has said is a focal point of its sweeping probe into the events around January 6. Clark and Rosen were featured heavily in a recent report issued by Democrats on the Senate Judiciary Committee that highlighted the relentlessness of Trump and some of his top advisers as they fixated on using the Justice Department to prop up false conspiracy theories about the election. While Thompson previously said the panel considers the Senate report a helpful resource in its investigation, the committee is now making clear it wants to hear from the former DOJ officials directly. The select committee has already interviewed Rosen\u2019s former deputy, Richard Donoghue. Describing the testimony that Rosen gave, Thompson said,\u201dThe eight hours of testimony \u2026 more or less validated what the Senate report said. So, the investigators on our staff pursued any and all questionings and they feel very solid that the information we have, both from the witness and the Senate hearing is solid.\u201d The committee has had a tall task since it embarked on its investigation. Their paper trail and who they are subpoenaing outline just how broad this investigation is truly becoming. Between finding out what really happened in the lead up to January 6, to understanding what role Trump and his orbit played, to unpacking how lies peddled about election fraud fueled the violence, there are endless roads this committee could go down. And with multiple subpoenas issued, the committee\u2019s fight over compliance could just be beginning. Bannon received his subpoena along with three other Trump loyalists: former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, former deputy chief of staff Dan Scavino, and Kash Patel, a former chief of staff to then-acting Secretary of Defense Christopher Miller who had also served as an aide to Republican Rep. Devin Nunes. The committee agreed to postpone deposition deadlines for Meadows, Scavino and Patel to give them more time for negotiations, but the committee says their patience is limited. On top of that, the committee has deadlines coming up next week for subpoenas they issued to individuals involved in the planning and organization of the \u201cStop the Steal\u201d rally that served as a prelude to the riot at the US Capitol and other rallies organized in the lead up to the day of the attack.

But by moving forward to hold Steve Bannon, the architect of Trump\u2019s nationalist populism, in criminal contempt for refusing to comply with a subpoena, the panel may be providing the mastermind of Trump\u2019s blow-it-all-up strategy yet another platform to try to tear down America\u2019s institutions. Action that will unfold next week against the ex-President\u2019s ideological soul mate is intended as a warning sign to those in Trump\u2019s wider orbit. And the chairman of the January 6 committee, Democratic Rep. Bennie Thompson, warned on CNN that no one is \u201coff limits\u201d in terms of being compelled to testify \u2013 including Trump himself. The panel is determined to use every method possible to find the truth about the lead-up to a pro-Trump mob storming the Capitol on January 6. But the committee\u2019s efforts may also end up emphasizing a dark truth revealed by Trump\u2019s time in power \u2013 and highlighting the increasing threat for the future, too \u2013 as Trump relentlessly attacks US democratic institutions ahead of a possible 2024 White House bid. Attempts to hold the former President\u2019s inner circle accountable often fall short and end up having the unintended effect of further politicizing the vital institutions of government. This committee\u2019s effort will face exactly the same kind of obstruction and intransigence as previous investigations of the former commander in chief meant to subject him to the checks and balances of the US constitutional system. January 6 investigators are talking about criminal contempt charges for ignored subpoenas. Here's what that means. In a wider sense, the coming legal duel will also underline how the constitutional promise of oversight has been constantly shredded by Trump both in and out of power. Bannon never hid his desire to tear down the rules set by Washington\u2019s establishment, so he may relish the challenge and the chance to launch a political cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bre. If so, he will prove again that once-powerful figures who resolve to defy normal guardrails of political behavior \u2013 and in Trump\u2019s case, the rule of law itself \u2013 often find they can operate with a degree of impunity. For Trump, for instance, even the historic stain of two impeachments turned out to be no deterrent to aberrant behavior and abuses of power \u2013 a reality that raises questions about the Constitution\u2019s resilience against presidents with autocratic tendencies. At the very least, this latest clash between Trump and the norms that have long governed US political life underscores how desperate the ex-President is, for whatever reason, to conceal what really happened on January 6. And while he is trying to obscure the truth about what happened in the last election, his conduct is offering a foreboding preview of how he might act in a second term, if he were to win the 2024 election. The Democratic-led panel wants to find out what Bannon and others around Trump were telling him before he incited a mob to invade the Capitol on the basis of his election fraud lies. There is no suggestion at this point that Bannon committed a crime. But his claim that his reported contacts with Trump earlier this year are covered by executive privilege \u2013 which allows a president to receive confidential advice from subordinates \u2013 is seen by many legal scholars as spurious since Bannon, fired as a White House adviser in 2017, had no government job under Trump at the time. The tactic, therefore, comes across as an attempt to obstruct a legally constituted congressional probe into one of the worst attacks on democracy in US history. As an example of how Trump will try to politicize the latest twist in the January 6 story, the ex-President put out a statement on Thursday demanding that the \u201cUn-Select commitee\u201d should \u201chold themselves in criminal contempt for cheating in the election\u201d and accused prosecutors of trying to destroy half the country. He added, \u201cThe people are not going to stand for it.\u201d So more than six months on, the ex-President is using new attempts to hold him to account as an opportunity for further incitement. Throughout Trump\u2019s term, the White House resisted Congress\u2019 oversight role and requests for documents and testimony at almost every turn. In the past, some administrations and political leaders have often sought to reach accommodations with investigations like the January 6 committee \u2013 one reason why criminal referrals have been comparatively rare in recent times. But that\u2019s hardly Trump\u2019s style. He showed as a businessman and celebrity even before entering politics that he would push convention and the rule of law to a breaking point. \u201cWhat we have seen in the past few years is just complete thumbing of the nose at Congress\u2019 subpoena power,\u201d said Kim Wehle, a professor at the University of Baltimore School of Law, on CNN\u2019s \u201cNewsroom\u201d on Thursday. As well as being an echo of the excesses of the previous administration, the fact that Bannon is going along with what appears to be a weak executive privilege argument made by Trump\u2019s lawyers contains a warning for the future about even more autocratic behavior if the former President is able to get behind the Oval Office desk again. Which is why the January 6 committee doesn\u2019t have much time to act. What is likely to be a prolonged and possibly inconclusive legal battle with Bannon could stretch right up until the midterm elections, when a possible new GOP House majority in January 2023 could just shut down the investigation before it has the chance to ink an official record for history on the outrage of January 6. As such, Bannon\u2019s strategy looks a lot like an attempt to run out the clock. The House select committee is due to meet on Tuesday evening to begin the process of making the referral, which will require a full House vote. It then goes to the US attorney for the District of Columbia to consider next steps. Given the deeply political nature of the case, it will almost certainly fall to US Attorney General Merrick Garland to decide whether to pursue a criminal case against Bannon. Stanley Brand, a former general counsel to the House of Representatives, said on CNN\u2019s \u201cNewsroom\u201d on Thursday that the process ahead was strewn with obstacles and was not guaranteed to produce the result the committee is hoping for. \u201cThe history of this is not all that easy for the Congress,\u201d said Brand, who was general counsel for the House in 1983, the last time that it referred a criminal contempt case to the Justice Department. \u201cAnd while they can, in a sense, huff and puff, until they get a conviction and a final judgment, it could be years,\u201d said Brand. Thompson, the Mississippi Democrat who chairs the January 6 select committee, made clear that his panel, which includes two Republicans, is trying to make an example of Bannon in taking the comparatively rare step of making a criminal referral to the Justice Department. \u201cWe think Steve Bannon has information that is germane to what happened on January 6,\u201d Thompson told CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer on \u201cThe Situation Room.\u201d \u201cIf he refuses the subpoena like we expect him to continue to do, we are left with no other choice than to ask the Justice Department to lock him up and hold him in contempt. Clearly, that might send enough of a message that he will agree to talk to us.\u201d Asked whether the committee could subpoena Trump, Thompson answered: \u201cNobody is off limits.\u201d Bannon\u2019s resistance does not render the committee toothless. Several other Trump acolytes, including ex-White House chief of staff Mark Meadows and former Pentagon official Kash Patel, are \u201cengaging\u201d with the committee \u2013 and the panel agreed to short postponements of their appearances \u2013 though it remains unclear if that contact amounts to any form of cooperation. They may find the prospect of a criminal referral more troublesome \u2013 even though Trump\u2019s lawyers have already claimed their deliberations with him are covered by executive privilege. And the committee has already heard from former acting Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen, who served in the tumultuous final days of the Trump administration as the then-President sought to thwart Joe Biden\u2019s presidential election victory across multiple fronts. But even as the committee pushes ahead, time will be ticking down to the midterm elections in November 2022, which could spell the probe\u2019s eventual demise. Multiple lengthy legal actions like one involving Bannon could still hamper its ability to get all the facts. According to Wehle, the law professor, that would be a \u201ctragedy for a democracy itself and the American people, frankly.\u201d",

            "article_content": "The committee investigating the January 6 Capitol Hill riot announced Thursday it is moving forward to hold Trump ally Steve Bannon in criminal contempt for refusing to comply with a subpoena, as his game of chicken with the House panel now enters a new and critical phase. \u201cMr. Bannon has declined to cooperate with the Select Committee and is instead hiding behind the former President\u2019s insufficient, blanket, and vague statements regarding privileges he has purported to invoke,\u201d Democratic Rep. Bennie Thompson, who chairs the committee, said in a statement on Thursday. LIVE UPDATES: January 6 committee pursues criminal contempt referral for Bannon Bannon was scheduled for a deposition in front of the committee on Thursday, and Bannon\u2019s lawyer wrote in a letter the day before to the panel saying that his client will not provide testimony or documents until the committee reaches an agreement with former President Donald Trump over executive privilege or a court weighs in on the matter. \u201cWe reject his position entirely,\u201d Thompson continued in his statement. \u201cThe Select Committee will not tolerate defiance of our subpoenas, so we must move forward with proceedings to refer Mr. Bannon for criminal contempt.\u201d With the committee officially announcing its decision to move forward with criminal contempt for Bannon, the next step is for the committee to hold a business meeting, which Thompson said would be Tuesday. The business meeting next week is the first in a series of steps needed to move forward with criminal contempt. In this meeting, the committee will adopt a contempt report, which outlines the efforts the committee made to get a witness to comply with the subpoena, and the failure by the witness to do so. This report is then referred to the House for a vote. If the vote succeeds, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi certifies the report to the United States attorney for the District of Columbia. Under law, this certification then requires the United States attorney to \u201cbring the matter before the grand jury for its action,\u201d but the Justice Department will also makes its own determinations for prosecuting. Any individual who is found liable for contempt of Congress is then guilty of a crime that may result in a fine and between one and 12 months imprisonment. But this process is rarely invoked, and rarely leads to jail time. As severe as a criminal contempt referral sounds, the House\u2019s choice to use the Justice Department may be more of a warning shot than a solution. Holding Bannon in criminal contempt through a prosecution could take years, and historic criminal contempt cases have been derailed by appeals and acquittals. Three other Trump allies also face subpoena deadlines this week. Two of them, Trump\u2019s former chief of staff Mark Meadows and former administration official Kash Patel, have been \u201cengaging\u201d with the committee, according to the panel, though it remains unclear if that contact amounts to any form of cooperation. The select committee agreed to short postponements of Patel\u2019s and Meadows\u2019 appearances as they continue to engage with the investigation, a committee aide told CNN on Thursday. But while Patel and Meadows appear to have bought themselves more time, the committee made clear Thursday its patience is limited. Rep. Adam Schiff echoed that sentiment in an interview Thursday, providing a rare window into how the committee is approaching talks with these individuals. The California Democrat described Patel to MSNBC as \u201cdemonstration of the principle in the Trump administration that the more willing you were to do anything the President wanted, no matter how unscrupulous, the higher and faster you could rise.\u201d \u201cAnd he rose Phoenix-like through the Trump administration one position after another, even being contemplated to take over the CIA,\u201d Schiff said, adding that Patel was \u201can evil Zelig.\u201d The committee was able only recently to serve Trump\u2019s former deputy chief of staff Dan Scavino a subpoena, a source familiar with the matter told CNN, and his deadline to appear for a deposition has likely been delayed. Asked Thursday about the possibility of subpoenaing Trump, Thompson told CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer on \u201cThe Situation Room\u201d that \u201cnobody is off limits to a subpoena from this committee.\u201d Thompson went on to dismiss the former President\u2019s attacks on the House panel as \u201ccute.\u201d \u201cEverybody that I know saw what happened on January 6. So clearly that\u2019s not who we are as Americans. If former President Trump thinks he can get away with what happened on January 6 by being cute with his press releases, then he has another thing coming,\u201d he said. Republican Rep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois, one of two GOP members serving on the select panel, offered a similar warning later Thursday evening. \u201cAnybody that is either being subpoenaed now or will be in the future, think twice before you reject a lawful order from Congress,\u201d he told CNN\u2019s Anderson Cooper on \u201cAC360.\u201d CNN reported Wednesday that the committee is unified in its plan to seek criminal charges against those who refuse to comply, and lawmakers have specifically honed in on Bannon while discussing the option publicly. \u201cThe reason why some of these witnesses, people like Steve Bannon, who have been public about their contempt for Congress feel they can get away with it is for four years, they did,\u201d Schiff told MSNBC on Wednesday. Schiff, who also chairs the Intelligence Committee, noted that Bannon had refused to cooperate with the House\u2019s Russia investigation during the Trump administration because he \u201cwould never be held in contempt.\u201d \u201cHe would never be prosecuted by the Trump Justice Department. But those days are over. And I view that not only as essential to our investigation but I also view this, the enforcement of the rule of law, as an early test of whether our democracy is recovering,\u201d the California Democrat added. The letter from Bannon\u2019s legal team said it may be up to the courts to decide whether he is ultimately forced to cooperate \u2013 essentially daring the House to sue or hold him in criminal contempt. \u201cAs such, until these issues are resolved, we are unable to respond to your request for documents and testimony,\u201d wrote the lawyer, Robert Costello. The claim that Bannon could be covered by the former President\u2019s privilege is unusual, because Bannon was not working for the federal government during the period surrounding the January 6 insurrection. CNN legal analyst Norm Eisen swiftly pushed back on Costello\u2019s letter Wednesday, saying, \u201cIt\u2019s just wrong. The letter quotes a case saying \u2018the President\u2019 can make executive privilege determinations. But Trump is no longer \u2018the President.\u2019 In the United States, we only have one of those at a time, he is Joe Biden, and he has not asserted privilege here.\u201d Privilege claims normally apply to close officials around the President and deliberations between government employees, and Bannon was fired from his role as a White House adviser in 2017. Many legal experts agree with the committee that Bannon, as a private citizen, would have no standing to block a subpoena by claiming executive privilege. As severe as a criminal contempt referral sounds, the House\u2019s choice to use the Justice Department may be more of a warning shot than a solution. Holding Bannon in criminal contempt through a prosecution could take years, and historic criminal contempt cases have been derailed by appeals and acquittals. \u201cThey\u2019re in a box, in a way,\u201d Stanley Brand, a former House general counsel, said on Wednesday. \u201cAny way they go is a legal donnybrook, potentially that will take time.\u201d Congress almost never forces a recalcitrant witness into testifying through prosecution, according to several longtime Washington attorneys familiar with congressional proceedings. An Environmental Protection Agency official in the Reagan administration was the last person indicted for criminal contempt of Congress. The DC US Attorney\u2019s Office of the Justice Department took eight days from receiving the House\u2019s contempt referral for Rita Lavelle in 1983 to having a grand jury indict her. Lavelle fought the charges to trial, and a jury found her not guilty. Steve Bannon was knee-deep in January 6 At least one other criminal contempt proceeding predating Lavelle, during the anti-communist McCarthy-era investigations of the 1950s, was overturned by the Supreme Court on appeal. In more recent administrations, the Justice Department has declined to prosecute contempt referrals \u2013 though in those situations, Congress has made contempt referrals on members of the sitting president\u2019s administration. \u201cI\u2019m watching people on TV bloviate about this. They\u2019re going to send [Bannon] to criminal contempt. OK. Fine. That just starts the case,\u201d Brand, who was the House general counsel during Lavelle\u2019s contempt proceedings, told CNN. \u201cThere\u2019s a trial. It\u2019s not automatic they\u2019re going to get convicted.\u201d The criminal contempt approach also is structured to be more of a punishment than an attempt to compel a witness to speak. \u201cIt\u2019s not like civil contempt, where you hold the keys to your jail cell and get released\u201d if a witness agrees to testify, Brand said. Instead, the House essentially loses control of the case as the Justice Department takes over to prosecute. \u201cThey don\u2019t have any time,\u201d Brand added. \u201cThey\u2019ve got to get this done before next year, before there\u2019s an election.\u201d This story and headline have been updated with additional developments Thursday.

            "article_content": "A number of high-powered lawyers who have represented Donald Trump in the past are sitting out his latest legal battle, as the former President prepares to assert executive privilege to block congressional investigators from getting information on the January 6 insurrection. That\u2019s left Trump with a relatively small legal team without a lot of experience litigating issues of executive privilege as he readies for a court fight that could test major issues of presidential authority. Some go-to attorneys have been spooked by Trump\u2019s reputation for sometimes not paying as a client, according to several people familiar with conservative legal circles. Others watched closely as lawyers fled Trump\u2019s prior teams, frustrated by him as a client or facing their own ethical predicaments. Others still want themselves and their firms to stay far away from Trump\u2019s insistence that the election was stolen. \u201cIt\u2019s not a 10-foot pole\u201d for law firms distancing themselves from Trump, \u201cit\u2019s a 1,000-foot pole,\u201d said John Yoo, a University of California at Berkeley law professor who held a senior Justice Department position in the George W. Bush administration. More than a half-dozen prominent attorneys who took notable roles in defending Trump or his advisers in the past are not assisting him this round. Those include Jay Sekulow and Ty Cobb, according to sources familiar with Trump\u2019s legal effort. And at least four well-known lawyers were repeatedly approached by Trump\u2019s team for help in recent weeks \u2013 and said no, a source familiar with the discussions tells CNN. Among the four is William Burck, the white-collar lawyer who represented 11 Trump associates in and after the Mueller investigation. Burck turned Trump down three times in recent months, according to people familiar with the former President\u2019s orbit, because he wanted to stay away from how toxic Trump\u2019s situation has become after the attempt to overturn the election, the people said. Trump said in a statement that he had never asked the four lawyers who turned him down, including Burck, for help. \u201cI don\u2019t even know who they are, they are just looking to get publicity,\u201d the ex-President said. \u201cI am using lawyers who have been with us from the beginning.\u201d \u201cI do pay my lawyers when they do a good job,\u201d Trump added. Indeed, lawyers who worked in Trump\u2019s White House or campaign are still at work for the ex-President and now focused on more narrow tasks, such as handling executive privilege discussions with the National Archives or communicating with potential ex-White House witnesses called to Capitol Hill. Two former legal advisers \u2013 Patrick Philbin from the Trump White House counsel\u2019s office and Justin Clark from the 2020 campaign \u2013 are still involved. Clark, for instance, signed letters outlining Trump\u2019s executive privilege concerns to four witnesses under subpoena. Large sections of the legal industry have publicly distanced themselves from Trump for years, and especially at the end of his presidency, when he pushed dozens of lawsuits to challenge his 2020 electoral loss and spread unfounded voter fraud accusations. Those lost cases have already resulted in the suspension of his celebrity attorney Rudy Giuliani\u2019s law license, prominent conservative attorney Cleta Mitchell\u2019s departure from her firm and the sanctioning of several other attorneys who worked on a case in Michigan. Giuliani and another lawyer, Sidney Powell, are also facing defamation lawsuits seeking billions of dollars in damages. Even longtime Trump law firms like Jones Day announced publicly that they wouldn\u2019t be involved in his legal challenges to the election. The three lawyers in addition to Burck who have turned down Trump\u2019s entreaties in recent months, one source said, are the conservative heavy-hitters Charles Cooper, Mark Filip and Paul Clement. Cooper, a former assistant attorney general with experience in congressional subpoena fights, told CNN he would watch any court fight about Trump and executive privilege \u201cfrom the bleachers.\u201d He declined to comment further. During Trump\u2019s impeachment over his dealings with Ukraine, Cooper brought an unconventional court challenge on behalf of a National Security Council witness that put on ice the House\u2019s ability to get testimony from that witness, Charles Kupperman, his boss John Bolton and then-White House chief of staff Mick Mulvaney. Filip, a former acting attorney general, and Clement, a former solicitor general, work at the same elite law firm, Kirkland & Ellis, that represents Trump\u2019s last attorney general, Jeffrey Rosen, in the Capitol Hill probes into January 6. Rosen already spoke to the Senate Judiciary Committee for hours about Trump\u2019s attempts to fire him and overturn the 2020 election, making his lawyers\u2019 involvement more difficult to secure \u2013 and even less likely. The firm declined to comment. In the January 6 aftermath, Trump\u2019s legal approach has structured itself differently from past investigations, such as the Mueller probe and during the Ukraine impeachment, where presidential privilege and litigation czars emerged. In those cases, Trump enlisted personal lawyers, witnesses\u2019 attorneys, the Justice Department and White House counsel\u2019s office experts to coordinate. But the ex-President now has no coordinating attorney leading his team, according to several people familiar with his approach. There also isn\u2019t a main attorney who\u2019s handling messaging on behalf of the former President. Trump\u2019s legal machine has been disjointed at times. Several people close to the former President have told CNN in recent days that they are not aware of a broad, cohesive legal strategy ready to respond on his behalf or a litigation heavyweight waiting in the wings to go to court. So far, Trump\u2019s legal response has largely consisted of writing letters to witnesses and weighing in on a congressional request to the National Archives, which houses his presidential papers. To the witnesses, Trump\u2019s legal team said he may want to assert executive privilege. The witnesses may have to decide on their own whether they will comply with subpoenas they\u2019ve received or fight them in court, the people said. That leaves Trump\u2019s team primarily dealing with the National Archives. Philbin and Pat Cipollone, former White House counsel, have also been involved behind the scenes there \u2013 but both could be key witnesses to Trump\u2019s actions in the last days of his presidency, complicating the roles they could play in the wider investigation. However, the pair already opened a Washington, DC, office of a California-based small litigation law firm with other former Trump administration colleagues, making it likely they\u2019ll continue to handle some legal needs for the former President. A larger, more experienced firm may be needed if the Trump executive privilege fight heads into appeals. Past presidents have used some of the most elite law firms in Washington to help them post-presidency, including the Clintons keeping a decades-long relationship with their private attorney David Kendall at Williams & Connolly and Ronald Reagan turning to Ted Olson, who had high-ranking Justice Department experience, to counsel him when he testified in a 1990 trial related to the Iran-Contra affair. \u201cYou\u2019d want to see a top 10 national law firm with a big, experienced DC office\u201d handling cases that test constitutional issues, such as how much say a former president has over the confidentiality of his records, said Yoo, the former Bush administration Justice official. \u201cYou don\u2019t see that here. It\u2019s quite glaring.\u201d Post-Watergate-era law allows for former presidents to have some say over what they want to keep protected in their presidential records \u2013 and to litigate what should stay confidential if they choose. A split has already materialized between what Trump wants and what the Biden White House\u2019s position is. Last Friday, Trump\u2019s political organization said it believed that more than 40 documents in the hands of the National Archives should stay confidential. The Biden White House, however, didn\u2019t oppose the documents going to the House investigation. That sets up the possibility of a complex and expensive court fight \u2013 where Trump may need to sue if he disagrees with the National Archives\u2019 approach to his papers. It\u2019s possible that the questions he could raise in court about executive privilege may need to be settled by the Supreme Court, Yoo said.

            "article_content": "The House\u2019s US Capitol insurrection probe is fast turning into a race against time, up against Republican efforts to delay an accounting on ex-President Donald Trump\u2019s coup attempt after losing the 2020 election even as he preemptively begins undermining the next one. It\u2019s hardly a shock that members of Trump\u2019s orbit are seeking to evade accountability and the rule of law. But it represents a problem for the committee nonetheless, as potential witnesses seek to drag out the process as long as possible. They do so in the knowledge that Republicans who have high hopes in the midterm elections would almost certainly shut down probes into January 6 if they reclaim the House. The select committee\u2019s members are showing fresh urgency, warning that Trump acolytes who diss subpoenas face criminal referrals, a move that would put the Biden administration\u2019s Justice Department in the hot seat. \u201cWe\u2019re not messing around,\u201d Rep. Adam Schiff of California, a Democratic member of the committee, told CNN\u2019s Ryan Nobles on Tuesday, emphasizing that the Department of Justice would be put in a position to make a critical choice on criminal referrals against Trump\u2019s associates because \u201cunlike the last administration, no one is above the law. And so we intend to move quickly.\u201d Another Democratic member of the committee, Rep. Elaine Luria of Virginia, said, \u201cYou will see the committee moving quickly\u201d on CNN\u2019s \u201cErin Burnett OutFront\u201d on Tuesday. And the committee\u2019s Republican vice chair, Rep. Liz Cheney of Wyoming, told CNN the panel \u201cis completely in solidarity\u201d on moving fast to pursue criminal contempt charges for those who evade subpoena deadlines. \u201cEvery single person on the committee recognizes how important it is for us to make sure that we enforce our subpoenas and that we do so expeditiously,\u201d Cheney said. The sense that time is finite reflects the fact that the committee \u2013 the final manifestation of a formal accounting process that pro-Trump Republicans tried to strangle \u2013 is the last chance to provide an official historic record and to find the truth about January 6 before Americans next vote in a national election next year. Leaders of the Democrat-heavy panel previously pledged to complete the probe by early next spring, before the midterm campaign consumes Washington. First, the committee faces several important deadlines this week, including for a list of Trump associates already served with subpoenas, as it seeks to find out what the ex-President was saying and doing on January 6 and in the days leading up to his attempt to steal President Joe Biden\u2019s election victory. Former Trump political guru Steve Bannon is due to provide a deposition and documents by Thursday but has said he will not cooperate, arguing that he is bound by \u201cexecutive privileges belonging to President Trump.\u201d The claim is potentially dubious since Bannon was not a White House official in January and does not appear to fall under traditional interpretations of executive privilege \u2013 a concept meant to secure the confidentiality of official advice to a president. Another Trump associate, Kash Patel, a former Pentagon official, has a deposition scheduled for Thursday. Former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows is scheduled to be deposed on Friday. Both men are said by Committee Chairman Bennie Thompson, a Mississippi Democrat, and Cheney to be \u201cengaging\u201d with the committee. Meadows, however, sought to politicize the investigation further on Monday, telling Laura Ingraham on Fox News that looking into the worst attack on American democracy in generations represented an effort by Democrats to \u201ctalk about anything other than the economy.\u201d A fourth Trump official, former deputy White House chief of staff Dan Scavino, also has a Friday deadline for a deposition. Another group, made up of lesser-known Trump associates and activists \u2013 including some involved in organizing the rally in Washington that Trump turned into a festival of incitement \u2013 faced a Wednesday deadline. Many appear unlikely to comply. Democrats have a couple of advantages now, compared with their halting efforts to compel testimony from Trump officials during the last administration. For one, House Democrats have spent years investigating Trump and his administration, impeaching him twice. They\u2019re familiar with the distraction of his political attacks, legal stalling tactics and the smoke-and-mirrors posturing that come from his inner cicle. They also now have a Department of Justice that is no longer under the 45th President\u2019s thumb. It took two years and a prolonged legal battle, for example, to compel former White House counsel Don McGahn to testify to the House Judiciary Committee about incidents recorded in former special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s report into Russian election interference. His appearance, this June, belatedly confirmed that Trump had asked him to fire Mueller, but it came long after the information had lost political salience. Now that Democrats control the administration, the select committee has a reasonable expectation of action if it decides to hold witnesses who refuse subpoenas in criminal contempt of Congress and refer them to the Justice Department after a vote in the full House. That would test the willingness of the department under Attorney General Merrick Garland \u2013 who has been criticized by some Democrats for not sufficiently pursuing Trump officials \u2013 to take enforcement action. \u201cIf people don\u2019t provide the documents they\u2019re compelled to, we intend to take up criminal contempt and refer to the Justice Department and we expect that it will be prosecuted,\u201d Schiff said Tuesday. \u201cThe former President \u2026 is still out pushing the big lie. The same big lie that led people to attack this building and beat police officers and put our lives at risk. So yes, we feel a sense of urgency.\u201d A criminal referral may concentrate the minds of witnesses. But it does not rule out possible attempts to contest the issue in court. Trump may also test arguments about executive privilege, meaning a familiar cycle of delays, judgments and appeals could still unfold and eat up the committee\u2019s precious time. Bannon and Trump might even welcome the spotlight of a court battle to highlight their claims that yet again the ex-President is being unfairly pursued by an elite establishment deep state, a message that resonates with his supporters. It remains unclear whether the committee will seek testimony from members of Congress allied with the former President, even including House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, a California Republican who spoke to Trump by phone on January 6 as the insurrection unfolded. But the sense of a ticking clock is being intensified by expanding GOP efforts to bury the outrage of the worst attack in 200 years on the seat of US democracy. Last week, for instance, Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa portrayed Trump as the victim of a Democratic-led Senate committee that revealed new details about what can now objectively be described as a coup attempt by the former President. Then Grassley gleefully accepted Trump\u2019s reelection endorsement at a lie-filled rally in the Hawkeye State on Saturday. Grassley is far from the first Republican to seek to whitewash the Capitol insurrection. The House GOP, for example, is now largely an arm of Trump\u2019s autocratic political aspirations. On \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d this week, the House Republican minority whip, Rep. Steve Scalise of Louisiana, refused to say that Biden had legitimately won an election in which there was no evidence of widespread fraud. McCarthy, blasted by Schiff on CNN on Tuesday as the ringleader of a bunch of \u201cinsurrectionists in suits and ties,\u201d did everything he could to thwart any kind of congressional investigation. But Grassley\u2019s rally appearance, in which he said he wouldn\u2019t be \u201ctoo smart\u201d if he declined the backing of Trump, since the former President is supported by 91% of Iowa Republicans, was the most tangible example yet of how the GOP \u2013 even in the person of a senator long respected on judicial issues \u2013 is suppressing the truth about January 6 to maximize its chances of power in 2022. Grassley\u2019s comment also epitomized the entire attitude of the GOP, a party that once boasted about triumphing over Soviet totalitarianism, toward Trump. None of his abuses of power \u2013 not even seeking to overthrow an American democracy that has prevailed for nearly 250 years \u2013 qualifies as a sufficient reason to walk away from his reflected political glory. As Cheney, one of two Republican members of the House select committee, put it in a tweet rebuking Scalise: \u201cPerpetuating the Big Lie is an attack on the core of our constitutional republic.\u201d There is little hope that even an expansive report on the insurrection will change the minds of millions of Republicans who are convinced that the last election was stolen from Trump and of conservative media propaganda networks. But at least there will be an accurate, institutionalized version of the truth, which will provide voters confronted with the whitewashing tactics of the GOP running into the next election a chance to find out what really happened.

            "article_content": "Former Trump aide Dan Scavino has been served a subpoena from the House select committee investigating the January 6 attack on the US Capitol, a source familiar with the matter told CNN, bringing an end to the panel\u2019s struggle to physically locate him. A process server brought the subpoena to former President Donald Trump\u2019s Mar-a-Lago resort in Florida on Friday, the source said. While Scavino was home in New York at the time, he asked a staff member to accept the subpoena on his behalf. In its letter to Scavino, the committee outlined that, because of his close proximity and long history of working with the former President, he can provide useful information regarding conversations Trump had on January 5 about trying to convince members of Congress to not certify the election, the former President\u2019s movements on January 6, and the broader communication strategy the White House had in the lead up to the January 6 rally. The source said that Scavino would review the subpoena with his attorneys early next week to determine next steps. Biden refuses to assert privilege over Trump documents sought by January 6 committee Scavino was among the former Trump aides that had been sent a letter from Trump\u2019s attorney this week advising that he intended to defend what he viewed as an infringement of executive privilege. In the letter viewed by CNN, an attorney for Trump advised them to \u201cwhere appropriate, invoke any immunities and privileges\u201d and not provide documents or testimony. Thursday had marked a deadline for four former Trump officials under subpoena to produce materials to the committee. Committee Chairman Bennie Thompson, a Mississippi Democrat, and Vice Chair Liz Cheney, a Wyoming Republican, said in a statement that former Trump officials Mark Meadows and Kash Patel are \u201cso far engaging\u201d with the panel. The statement did not mention Scavino. An attorney for Steve Bannon said in an email obtained by CNN that he will not cooperate, citing Trump\u2019s claim of executive privilege. Bannon\u2019s lawyer told the committee that \u201cthe executive privileges belong to President Trump\u201d and \u201cwe must accept his direction and honor his invocation of executive privilege.\u201d Bannon to defy subpoena from January 6 committee, citing Trump's 'direction' The claim that Bannon could be covered by the former President\u2019s privilege is unusual because Bannon was not working for the federal government during the period surrounding the January 6 insurrection. In their statement, Thompson and Cheney make clear that the committee will act \u201cswiftly\u201d against those who refuse to comply with a lawful subpoena, including by seeking to hold them in criminal contempt, as they try to squash concerns that the committee will not act forcefully enough. The White House on Friday informed the National Archives that it would not assert executive privilege on an initial batch of documents related to the January 6 violence at the US Capitol, paving the way for the Archives to share documents with the House committee. \u201cThe President has determined that an assertion of executive privilege is not warranted for the first set of documents from the Trump White House that have been provided to us by the National Archives,\u201d press secretary Jen Psaki said of President Joe Biden\u2019s decision.

            "article_content": "Steve Bannon will not cooperate with the House select committee investigating January 6, his lawyer said in an email obtained by CNN that cites former President Donald Trump\u2019s claim of executive privilege. Bannon\u2019s attorney told the committee that \u201cthe executive privileges belong to President Trump\u201d and \u201cwe must accept his direction and honor his invocation of executive privilege.\u201d The letter from Bannon\u2019s legal team goes on to say it may be up to the courts to decide whether he is ultimately forced to cooperate \u2013 essentially daring the House to sue or hold him in criminal contempt. \u201cAs such, until these issues are resolved, we are unable to respond to your request for documents and testimony,\u201d wrote the lawyer, Robert Costello. The letter, sent to the committee Thursday, came after a lawyer for former President Donald Trump told subpoena targets, including Bannon, not to comply with congressional requests for testimony and documents that could concern privileged material. Here's what happens if a congressional subpoena is ignored (and what it means for the January 6 committee) The claim that Bannon could be covered by the former President\u2019s privilege is unusual because Bannon was not working for the federal government during the period surrounding the January 6 insurrection. Privilege claims normally apply to close officials around the president and deliberations between government employees, and Bannon was fired from his role as a White House adviser in 2017. Many legal experts say Bannon, as a private citizen, would have no standing to block a subpoena by claiming executive privilege. Bannon\u2019s legal team also indicated Bannon would comply with court rulings on the matter. \u201cWe will comply with the directions of the courts, when and if they rule on these claims of both executive and attorney client privileges,\u201d according to the letter. \u201cSince these privileges belong to President Trump and not to Mr. Bannon, until these issues are resolved, Mr. Bannon is legally unable to comply with your subpoena requests for documents and testimony.\u201d Bannon and other Trump associates were sent subpoenas by the House select committee late last month for private depositions and records. All document requests were due Thursday and the former Trump staffers were asked to appear before the committee next week. Committee Chairman Bennie Thompson, a Mississippi Democrat, and Vice Chair Liz Cheney, a Wyoming Republican, said that former Trump officials Mark Meadows and Kash Patel are \u201cso far engaging\u201d with the panel. Patel told CNN in a statement Friday that \u201cI can confirm that I have responded to the subpoena in a timely manner.\u201d \u201cBeyond that, I will not comment on my confidential dealings with the Committee. But I can assure you that I will continue to tell the truth and remain focused on Fight With Kash to help any American who has been censored and misrepresented online,\u201d he continued. It is not clear if former deputy chief of staff Dan Scavino has responded. Takeaways from the Senate Judiciary Committee report on Trump's attempted coup All four were also sent letters from Trump\u2019s attorney this week advising them he intended to defend what he viewed as an infringement of executive privilege. In the letter viewed by CNN, an attorney for Trump advised them to \u201cwhere appropriate, invoke any immunities and privileges\u201d and not provide documents or testimony. A spokesman for the committee declined to comment. A legal fight could take quite a bit of time, and Democrats could be facing a deadline of the 2022 midterm elections. \u201cWhile Mr. Meadows and Mr. Patel are, so far, engaging with the Select Committee, Mr. Bannon has indicated that he will try to hide behind vague references to privileges of the former President. The Select Committee fully expects all of these witnesses to comply with our demands for both documents and deposition testimony,\u201d Thompson and Cheney said. In their statement, Thompson and Cheney make clear that the committee will act \u201cswiftly\u201d against those who refuse to comply with a lawful subpoena, including by seeking to hold them in criminal contempt, as they try to squash concerns that the committee will not act forcefully enough. \u201cThough the Select Committee welcomes good-faith engagement with witnesses seeking to cooperate with our investigation, we will not allow any witness to defy a lawful subpoena or attempt to run out the clock, and we will swiftly consider advancing a criminal contempt of Congress referral,\u201d they said. Bannon, who was Trump\u2019s former White House chief strategist, spoke with Trump in December, urging him to focus on January 6 \u2013 the date of the official certification on the Electoral College vote by Congress, according to authors Bob Woodward and Robert Costa in their book \u201cPeril.\u201d \u201c\u2018We\u2019re going to bury Biden on January 6th,\u2019\u201d Bannon is quoted as saying. Steve Bannon was knee-deep in January 6 Woodward and Costa also reported that Trump called Bannon following his contentious January 5 meeting with then-Vice President Mike Pence, in which the vice president said he does not have the authority to block certification of Joe Biden\u2019s win. In its letter to Bannon, the select committee cited communications he had with Trump in December \u201cand potentially other occasions\u201d in which Bannon reportedly urged Trump \u201cto plan for and focus his efforts on January 6.\u201d To Meadows, the committee wrote that investigation has revealed \u201ccredible evidence of your involvement in events within the scope of the Select Committee\u2019s inquiry,\u201d citing his close proximity to Trump on the day of the attack. The committee also wants to learn more about Meadows\u2019 efforts to aid overturning the 2020 election results. When the subpoenas were first issued, House Select Chairman Bennie Thompson, a Mississippi Democrat, had told CNN\u2019s Manu Raju that criminal contempt is \u201con the table\u201d if the individuals the committee has sent subpoenas to do not cooperate. This story has been updated with additional details Friday. CNN\u2019s Annie Grayer, Zachary Cohen, Whitney Wild and Veronica Stracqualursi contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Donald Trump always seems to get away with it. And he\u2019s trying to do it again. The ex-President and his Republican apologists in Congress are jump-starting a new effort to dampen the consequences of his crimes against democracy, burying the truth about what can now objectively be termed a coup attempt. A flurry of new and shocking behind-the-scenes details of Trump\u2019s multi-pronged attempts to steal last November\u2019s election are showing just how perilously close the country came to a constitutional disaster in January. This rush of developments on just one day poses profound questions for Congress, the Biden administration and potentially the courts \u2013 and follows other new evidence of Trump\u2019s anti-democratic conduct, including about a step-by-step plan drawn up by a conservative lawyer for how then-Vice President Mike Pence could subvert the constitutional process of certifying Biden\u2019s election win. Here's what happens if a congressional subpoena is ignored (and what it means for the January 6 committee) One key issue concerns how far the select committee and the Justice Department are prepared to go to impose accountability on those involved, including the former President. Does the panel have the power and the steel to do so quickly, to prevent Trump running out the clock for what could be a pliant GOP Congress after next fall\u2019s midterm elections? Would, for example, President Joe Biden\u2019s Attorney General Merrick Garland be ready to enforce any contempt referrals from Congress and bring the weight of the law against Trump allies who refuse to cooperate with the committee? It\u2019s still unclear what, if any, response his subpoenaed allies have provided. Ultimately, the issue is about whether there is any legal or political remedy equal to the scale of Trump\u2019s transgressions \u2013 or, perhaps more importantly, that might deter his relentless attempts to destroy his successor\u2019s legitimacy and faith in an electoral system that reflected the will of a nation that wanted him gone from the Oval Office. Some might argue that an unprecedented two impeachments represent the ultimate sanction and historic stain. But Trump\u2019s acquittal by Republicans in his first Senate trial only convinced him he could abuse power with impunity. And his second acquittal \u2013 once he was out of office \u2013 did nothing to temper his corrosive claims of electoral fraud, and is no deterrent as he builds an apparent new presidential campaign on the lie that the last election was corrupt. Accountability is critical for multiple reasons. The Capitol insurrection and Trump\u2019s multiple attempts to subvert the election, in Washington and in the states, rank as the worst assault on the US electoral system in history. Inflicting a price for such behavior is vital to stop such abuses from happening again, and potentially could include new laws to bolster faith in elections. Recent escalations of Trump\u2019s attacks on bedrock democratic values and signals that he is planning a new White House bid prove that his threat to democratic governance is far from elapsed and is getting worse. The January 6 committee\u2019s role is important in establishing a contemporary and historical record of what happened that day and Trump\u2019s culpability amid efforts by his media propagandists and political allies to whitewash the truth and downplay an outrageous assault on the epicenter of US democracy. An immediate question for the select committee will be how to counter any refusal to cooperate by Trump allies who received subpoenas, including former adviser Steve Bannon, former chief of staff Mark Meadows and ex-Defense official Kash Patel. The committee has failed to locate another subpoenaed Trump aide, former deputy chief of staff and social media guru Dan Scavino, multiple sources familiar with the effort told CNN. Trump allies did little to investigate election fraud claims, court documents show \u201cThis is going to be the test for this January 6 committee,\u201d said Carrie Cordero, a former senior Justice Department official and CNN legal and national security analyst, on \u201cThe Lead with Jake Tapper.\u201d \u201cHow far are they willing to go in order to enforce their authority and provide for the authority of Congress to conduct this investigation? Are they going to make criminal referrals to the Justice Department for contempt or even potentially for obstruction?\u201d Trump\u2019s decision to put up roadblocks is no surprise given a lifetime of seeking to evade accountability for his actions in business and politics. He fought for months, for example, to stop his financial record from being obtained by investigators probing the Trump Organization in New York. The firm and its former chief financial officer, Allen Weisselberg, have been charged over an alleged tax scheme. Trump\u2019s ostensible justification for trying to evade accountability here is that he is trying to protect the integrity of his former office by upholding executive privilege \u2013 the ability of presidents to get confidential advice from subordinates. This is a predictable but hardly credible defense, at least outside the realms of a narrow legal argument. After all, Trump spent four years destroying the standards and codes of conduct implied by his office and gave no indication that he was concerned about preserving its model of rectitude for future generations. And in this case, he appears to be seeking to assert privilege to cover up what multiple accounts and reports suggest is an attempt to mount a coup. \u201cExecutive privilege will be defended, not just on behalf of President Trump and his administration, but also on behalf of the Office of the President of the United States and the future of our nation,\u201d Taylor Budowich, director of communications for Save America and Trump, said in a statement. Trump can try to uphold his executive privilege claims in court, in an attempt to further string out the business of the committee. But the Biden White House, the current guardian of executive privilege, could take a relaxed view of document requests in this area. A source familiar with the former President\u2019s legal strategy confirmed to CNN that an attorney for Trump sent letters to some of the subpoena targets, informing them of his plan to defend executive privilege. The letters were first reported by Politico. While the letter instructed the subpoena targets to not comply with congressional investigators, according to the Washington Post, which reviewed it, it is up to each witness to decide whether to follow Trump\u2019s direction. At the same time that Trump was trying to escape accountability, the GOP response to Thursday\u2019s Senate Judiciary Committee report from the majority Democrats again highlighted a trend that has enabled Trump\u2019s past abuses of power and that ensures he remains a viable political figure. In a dueling document, Republicans on the committee presented a different interpretation of the facts contained in the majority report. Their action was consistent with a party that blocked an independent 9/11-style commission into the January 6 insurrection on Trump\u2019s command, and that has consistently prioritized its political priorities and the need to appeal to the ex-President\u2019s supporters over its duty to democracy. Trump's appeasers only make his assault on democracy worse The GOP document essentially argued that since Trump was prevented by advisers from following through on many of his schemes to subvert democracy and steal power, there is no case to answer. For instance, the then-President didn\u2019t actually carry out his plan to replace acting attorney general Jeffrey Rosen with Clark \u2013 though not for the want of trying. \u201cThe President rejected it. The President did the right thing,\u201d Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley, the top Republican on the Judiciary Committee, said. The argument that Trump\u2019s nefarious plots failed so he is free of accountability is a familiar one. It was used by Republicans to excuse his abuses of power during his first impeachment on the grounds that Trump\u2019s plan to withhold military aid to Ukraine in return for the announcement of a criminal probe into Biden did not actually come to fruition. This essentially boils down a case that a President who seeks to thwart the Constitution is only guilty if he succeeds. This discounts, for instance, strong evidence that Trump repeatedly pressured officials in the Justice Department and in states like Georgia to overturn the election \u2013 a clear and staggering abuse of power. The courage and integrity of these officials was in the end all that stood between the United States and a lost democracy. But the near miss this time should not mean that officials subordinate to a President should be left exposed to such pressure in the future. The threat has not passed. Trump is busily endorsing candidates for secretary of state positions in swing states Georgia, Michigan and Arizona who have supported his election lies. If they are elected, such officials could have huge influence over the 2024 election in which Trump could be a candidate amid growing fears that any Republican effort to illegitimately seize power next time could work. All of this, and Trump\u2019s refusal to cede to the reality of his election loss and his expanding efforts to plot a potentially fraudulent path back to power, helps explain why the work of the select committee is so crucial.

            "article_content": "The House select committee investigating the January 6 attack on the US Capitol is preparing for the eventuality that some of former President Donald Trump\u2019s allies will refuse to comply with subpoenas as part of the inquiry. But what happens then? Among the options the panel is weighing to compel cooperation is the threat of holding them in criminal contempt. Former Trump aide Dan Scavino could be the first to test that threat, with the select committee so far unable to physically serve him a subpoena, according to multiple sources familiar with the effort. \u201cNow it is important that we actually find out who was talking to Donald Trump, and what they were saying. That\u2019s why we formed this committee that had subpoena power to gather that information,\u201d Rep. Jason Crow, a Colorado Democrat, told CNN\u2019s Don Lemon on \u201cDon Lemon Tonight.\u201d If subpoenas are disregarded, he added Wednesday, \u201cI\u2019m going to highly encourage the authorities to pursue criminal contempt because frankly, that\u2019s what would happen to any American.\u201d Here\u2019s what you need to know about being held in contempt of Congress: It means someone has obstructed the work of either Congress or a congressional committee. While there are many ways someone can be in contempt of Congress, these days it usually happens when someone doesn\u2019t comply with a congressional subpoena, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Research Service. Sometimes that disobedience means refusing to appear before a committee to testify, and sometimes that means refusing to pony up requested documents. \u201cContempt may be used either to coerce compliance, to punish the contemnor, and/or to remove the obstruction,\u201d the Congressional Research Service said. There are several ways members of Congress can do this: 1) They can tell the House or Senate sergeant-at-arms to detain or imprison the person in contempt until he or she honors congressional demands. This is called \u201cinherent contempt.\u201d But it\u2019s extremely rare and hasn\u2019t happened in modern times. 2) Congress can vote on criminal contempt, then make a referral to the executive branch \u2013 headed by the President \u2013 to try to get the person criminally prosecuted. A month or more jail sentence is a possibility if a witness won\u2019t comply, under the law. This is the approach members of Congress have indicated publicly they\u2019d want to pursue. It\u2019s unclear how quickly this route would move, and how the Biden Justice Department would respond to a contempt referral from the Democrats in the House. 3) Congress can ask the judicial branch to enforce a congressional subpoena. In other words, Congress can seek a federal court\u2019s civil judgment saying the person is legally obligated to comply with the subpoena. During the Trump presidency, the House tried this approach many times, but the court process moved so slowly it took months or even years for standoffs to resolve. Some, like a House subpoena for Trump\u2019s IRS returns, still linger before a trial judge. Beyond Scavino, the panel has also subpoenaed former Trump White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, former adviser Steve Bannon and Kash Patel, a former chief of staff to then-Acting Secretary of Defense Christopher Miller. Patel has acknowledged he\u2019s received the committee\u2019s subpoena and said he would \u201ccontinue to tell the truth to the American people about the events of January 6th.\u201d More recently, the panel issued subpoenas to 11 individuals who were affiliated with Women for America First, the organization that held the permit for the \u201cStop the Steal\u201d rally on January 6 that served as a prelude to the Capitol riot. While Trump threatened more than a month ago to assert executive privilege to block the committee\u2019s earlier request for records, he hasn\u2019t yet stepped up as a shield. And he didn\u2019t try to stand in the way of former DOJ top brass testifying this summer about his push to spread election fraud lies. The White House and Justice Department are signaling that they believe the exceptional nature of January 6 means they wouldn\u2019t go to bat for witnesses ignoring subpoenas. But the White House also said they\u2019d look at Capitol Hill requests case by case, in case there\u2019s a need to assert presidential privilege.

            "article_content": "More than a week after subpoenaing former Donald Trump aide Dan Scavino to cooperate with its investigation into the January 6 riot at the US Capitol, the House select committee investigating the attack has been unable to physically serve the subpoena to him, according to multiple sources familiar with the effort. The news comes just days before the committee\u2019s deadline for Scavino and three other close allies of the former President to comply with subpoenas requesting documents by October 7 and a deposition by October 15. Scavino, Trump\u2019s former White House deputy chief of staff, did not respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment. One source familiar with the situation joked that the committee should just tweet the subpoena to the former Trump aide since he\u2019s been actively trolling the panel there in recent days. The other Trump aides who have been subpoenaed include former Trump White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, former adviser Steve Bannon and Kash Patel, a former chief of staff to then-acting Secretary of Defense Christopher Miller. Patel has acknowledged he\u2019s received the committee\u2019s subpoena. It appears that the committee has been successful in their attempts to serve subpoenas to the other two Trump allies. In their letter to Scavino, the committee outlines that because of his close proximity and long history of working with the former President, he can provide useful information regarding conversations Trump had on January 5 about trying to convince members of Congress to not certify the election, the former President\u2019s movements on January 6, and the broader communication strategy the White House had in the lead up to the January 6 rally. The committee is also preparing for the eventuality that some of Trump\u2019s allies will refuse to comply with the subpoenas. Among the options the panel is weighing to compel their cooperation is the threat of holding them in criminal contempt. At the same time, Trump and those in his orbit who are likely considered to be witnesses in the committee\u2019s probe have offered little indication they have coalesced around a broader legal strategy \u2013 whether that be some combination of the former president invoking executive privilege, resisting the subpoenas in an effort to run out the clock or pleading the 5th. While Trump threatened more than a month ago to invoke executive privilege to block the committee\u2019s earlier request for records, several people close to the former president have told CNN in recent days that they are not aware of a legal strategy taking shape since then. CNN reached out to a dozen lawyers who have represented or advised Trump in the past, but either they did not respond or weren\u2019t willing to be interviewed. One attorney, John Eastman, would only say that if he were representing Trump in this matter, it would be a violation of attorney-client privilege to say so. Doug Collins, a former congressman, has been representing Trump on these matters before other committees this summer, but has not responded to CNN\u2019s repeated requests for comment. Republican Rep. Adam Kinzinger, one of two GOP members serving on the select panel, told CNN\u2019s Jim Sciutto the committee is \u201cgoing to do everything in our power to get them to testify.\u201d \u201cI mean, there is civil, there is criminal referrals that can happen if they refuse, refusing a subpoena from congress is a crime. We aren\u2019t out to try to hang this around anybody\u2019s neck. We want answers,\u201d he said. \u201cThe problem is when you start seeing people resist, and people obfuscate, you have to look at that and go why are they doing that if they have nothing to hide? We have a lot of people coming and talking to us voluntarily. We\u2019ll get to the bottom of it. We want to do it quickly, efficiently and thoroughly,\u201d he added.

            "article_content": "Special Counsel John Durham has issued a new set of subpoenas, including to a law firm with close ties to Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 campaign, an indication that Durham could be trying to build a broader criminal case, according to people briefed on the matter. So far, Durham\u2019s two-year probe into the FBI\u2019s Russia investigation hasn\u2019t brought about the cases Republicans hoped it would. The grand jury subpoenas for documents came earlier this month after Durham charged Clinton campaign lawyer Michael Sussmann with lying to the FBI in a September 2016 meeting. During that meeting, Sussmann handed over data purporting to show links between the Trump Organization and Russia\u2019s Alfa Bank. That tip became part of the FBI\u2019s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election but the FBI ultimately couldn\u2019t find evidence of a link. In seeking additional documents from Sussmann\u2019s former law firm, Perkins Coie, investigators from the special counsel\u2019s office appear to be sharpening their focus on the Democratic political machinery during the 2016 campaign and efforts to tie Trump to Russia. Perkins Coie\u2019s clients in 2016 included the Clinton campaign and the Democratic National Committee. The law firm also hired on the campaign\u2019s behalf a research company that commissioned the dossier from ex-British spy Christopher Steele that alleged that Trump was compromised by Russia. Durham has already accessed reams of the law firm\u2019s records, such as billing records, meeting calendars and a log of documents that the firm protects under attorney-client privilege. Some of the newly sought-after documents have been guarded so far by attorney-client privilege. An attorney for the law firm didn\u2019t respond to requests for comment. Durham\u2019s new subpoenas could lead to a court fight over privileged information and draw more about the Clinton campaign into the open. While working for Perkins Coie, Sussmann also represented Rodney Joffe, a cybersecurity expert referred to in Durham\u2019s indictment as \u201cTech Executive-1.\u201d In 2016, Joffe, who has not been previously identified, worked with researchers to collect internet data about the Trump Organization that Sussmann took to the FBI. Durham\u2019s continued use of the federal grand jury in Washington, DC, signals that he could be interested in adding to Sussmann\u2019s charges or bringing cases against additional defendants. Still, more than two years after being commissioned by then Attorney General William Barr to investigate whether federal authorities improperly targeted the Trump campaign, Durham has little to show for his efforts. His special counsel probe, which has lasted longer than Special Counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation, has so far brought only two lying charges against little-known figures, including the case against Sussmann, who has pleaded not guilty. The results have underwhelmed Trump supporters who had hoped former top FBI and intelligence officials would be prosecuted for \u201cspying\u201d on Trump and his campaign. Already the scope of Durham\u2019s probe has narrowed after Barr announced last year that investigators had found no wrongdoing by the CIA. Yet Durham has continued his investigation, largely in secrecy, working out of a non-descript office building near trendy Washington\u2019s Union Market. Durham\u2019s single charge against Sussmann relates to a September 2016 meeting he had with then-FBI General Counsel James Baker \u2013 and is largely based on details that appear to rest on Baker\u2019s thin memory of the meeting. Baker told Congress in 2018 that he didn\u2019t remember Sussmann \u201cspecifically saying that he was acting on behalf of a particular client.\u201d According to Durham, Sussmann lied in that meeting, hiding from the FBI that he was working for the Clinton campaign, to whom he billed the FBI meeting time. By the time Sussmann met with the FBI, the bureau was already investigating Russian meddling in the 2016 election. But Durham alleges the Clinton campaign\u2019s involvement with Sussmann could have made a difference to the FBI, potentially causing the agency to change its approach to investigating the information Sussmann shared. The federal judge overseeing the case, Christopher \u201cCasey\u201d Cooper of the DC District Court, will likely weigh during court proceedings before a trial whether Sussmann disclosing his client to the FBI mattered. If Cooper allows the case to move forward, he could kick that question to a trial jury. In interviews with CNN, several former federal prosecutors criticized Durham\u2019s use of what\u2019s known as a speaking indictment against Sussmann, laying out a broader case detailing the suspected political motivations and conduct by several people outside of Sussmann\u2019s legal practice who aren\u2019t actually charged. The former prosecutors say a false statement charge is typically straightforward, and often laid out in a single sheet of paper. \u201cThere are two ways to take it: The way charitable and favorable to Durham is this is basically making a case for this being material,\u201d said Ken White, a former prosecutor-turned-white collar defense lawyer in Los Angeles who follows Trump-era cases closely. \u201cThe less charitable interpretation is, this is Durham doing what he\u2019s going to do, basically making his pitch for Trump as a victim.\u201d Sussmann\u2019s legal team, in a statement, has called the breadth of the indictment a political smear. They have already told the court they may challenge parts of his indictment for being irrelevant, in an attempt to keep them from the jury. And they maintain Sussmann committed no crime. The larger narrative Durham describes lays out a practice not uncommon in politics and a world that\u2019s usually opaque to the general public \u2013 in which campaigns traffic stories that could hurt their opponents, and sometimes try to get law enforcement to open investigations into alleged wrongdoing. At times, the research and authorities\u2019 reactions to the research will leak to the news media as part of partisan attempts to affect election outcomes. Lawyers steeped in Washington are often involved in opposition research efforts. Justice Department officials suspected a similar effort was in the works in 2020, when Rudy Giuliani sought meetings with top Justice officials to provide documents related to Joe Biden and his son, Hunter, while providing news organizations some of the same information, according to former Trump administration officials. These practices themselves aren\u2019t regulated by the law, and Durham hasn\u2019t charged as a crime any actions central to the opposition research itself. \u201cCertainly it\u2019s routine for people with contacts in the government to be hired to try to get the government interested into launching an investigation that\u2019s advantageous for clients,\u201d White said. \u201cIt\u2019s all part of petitioning the government.\u201d John Podesta, 2016 Clinton campaign chairman, declined to comment on the tactics used by the campaign. But he called Durham\u2019s indictment of Sussmann an \u201cexercise in diversion and obfuscation.\u201d He added that Barr hired Durham specifically to pursue a partisan investigation of Democrats and that after two years \u201che doesn\u2019t have a lot to show for it.\u201d An attorney representing the Clinton campaign declined to comment. Durham\u2019s indictment also portrays researchers working with Joffe as harboring doubts about whether the Trump-Alfa Bank information was anything other than innocuous email traffic. But the indictment cites snippets of sentences from emails, leaving out further discussion among the researchers that appears to show they firmly believed the Trump-Alfa Bank connection was suspicious and needed to be investigated. The indictment cites one email conversation in which one of the researchers suggests narrowly tailoring their findings to make a \u201cplausible\u201d case that there was something worth investigating about Trump and Alfa Bank.  The rest of the email\u2014left out by prosecutors in the indictment\u2013continues: \u201cIf the white paper intends to say that here are communications between at least Alfa and Trump which are intentionally being hidden by Alfa and Trump, I absolutely believe that is the case,\u201d according to the email reviewed by CNN. The full emails would likely become a key part of a trial. Elsewhere in the indictment, Durham quotes an email sent to Joffe and others involved in the effort, in which one of the researchers wrote, \u201cLet\u2019s for a moment think of the best case scenario, where we are able to show (somehow) that DNS communication exists between Trump and R[ussia]. How do we plan to defend against the criticism that this is not spoofed traffic we are observing? There is no answer to that,\u201d the indictment noted. The unnamed researcher continued, \u201cWe cannot technically make any claims that would fly public scrutiny. The only thing that drive[s] us at this point is that we just do not like [Trump].\u201d Joffe also wrote that the suggestion of Trump being tied to a Russian bank would be a \u201cjackpot,\u201d according to the indictment. But additional emails reviewed by CNN appear to show that after expressing their skepticisms in late August 2016, the researchers expanded the scope of their research and believed they should show their findings to the FBI. In a statement to CNN, Steven A. Tyrrell, Joffe\u2019s attorney, said Durham\u2019s indictment is \u201cfull of cherry-picked portions of emails and selective facts that gratuitously present an incomplete and misleading picture of his actions and role in the events in question.\u201dTyrrell said that his client \u201cstands behind the rigorous research and analysis that was conducted, culminating in the report he felt was his patriotic duty to share with the FBI.\u201d While the Durham indictment details alleged dirty tricks by the Clinton campaign, there\u2019s also a big part of the 2016 story that\u2019s missing from it. By the time Sussmann met with the FBI, the bureau was already investigating a Russian hack-and-dump campaign aimed at damaging Clinton. Podesta and the Democratic National Committee were targeted by Russian intelligence agencies and their private emails were released publicly, and a separate Russian bot network fed anti-Clinton propaganda online. Mueller\u2019s report found that the Russian effort was aimed at least in part to help Trump win the election, and that Trump\u2019s allies welcomed and even encouraged that help. Trump himself fed the suspicions. In July 2016, Trump publicly encouraged Russia to target Clinton. \u201cRussia, if you\u2019re listening, I hope you\u2019re able to find the 30,000 emails that are missing, I think you will probably be rewarded mightily by our press,\u201d Trump said, making reference to thousands of emails that at the time the FBI said had been deleted and not recovered as part of its investigation of Clinton\u2019s private email server. The FBI that month had closed the investigation of Clinton and recommended no charges. Durham also doesn\u2019t write into his indictment of Sussmann additional reasons why the FBI had suspicions about Trump and Russia. American intelligence was taking in tips on multiple fronts, and ultimately investigators looked at a handful of Trump advisers, including campaign chairman Paul Manafort, as well as foreign policy contacts George Papadopoulos and Carter Page, who had contacts with Russians. Previously, Durham spoke to witnesses and gathered information about the federal government\u2019s investigations related to both Papadopoulos and Page. A few of the interviews Durham considered holding never materialized this year, according to several sources familiar with Durham\u2019s work. This story has been updated.",

            "article_content": "The select committee investigating the January 6 riot at the US Capitol issued its first round of subpoenas Thursday, targeting close aides and allies of former President Donald Trump. The subpoenas come as the select committee seeks to investigate efforts the Trump White House took to potentially overturn the 2020 presidential election and how the spread of misinformation fueled the anger and violence that led to the Capitol insurrection. The four subpoenas are going to former Trump White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, former deputy chief of staff Dan Scavino, former adviser Steve Bannon and Kash Patel, a former chief of staff to then-acting Secretary of Defense Christopher Miller who had also served as an aide to Republican Rep. Devin Nunes. The former Trump staffers are being issued subpoenas for private depositions and records. All document requests are due by October 7. The committee requests that Patel and Bannon appear on October 14, while Scavino and Meadows have been requested to appear before the committee on October 15. CNN has reached out to Meadows, Scavino and Bannon for comment. Patel said in a statement late Thursday that he was \u201cdisappointed, but not surprised\u201d that the committee had subpoenaed him \u201cbefore seeking (his) voluntary cooperation,\u201d adding: \u201cI will continue to tell the truth to the American people about the events of January 6th.\u201d White House moving to release information on Trump to congressional investigators The decision to call a group of Trump loyalists in front of the committee at this early stage demonstrates the direction of their investigatory process. The committee members have said they are very interested in what information was known within Trump\u2019s orbit about the planning leading up to the insurrection and decisions made that day. A select committee aide told CNN on Thursday that the panel expects \u201call witnesses to cooperate with the select committee\u2019s probe. Congress has broad investigative authority and we won\u2019t permit our investigation to be stonewalled.\u201d House Select Chairman Bennie Thompson, a Mississippi Democrat, said in a statement that \u201cthe Select Committee is investigating the facts, circumstances, and causes of the January 6th attack and issues relating to the peaceful transfer of power, in order to identify and evaluate lessons learned and to recommend to the House and its relevant committees corrective laws, policies, procedures, rules, or regulations.\u201d Thompson told CNN\u2019s Manu Raju on Friday that criminal contempt is \u201con the table\u201d if the individuals the committee has sent subpoenas to do not cooperate. \u201cWe\u2019ve discussed it,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cAnd if it comes to that, there will be no reluctance at all on the committee to do that.\u201d Thompson said that of the first four the committee subpoenaed, \u201cwe are not holding the opinion that they will cooperate.\u201d He added that the committee went straight to issuing subpoenas because the information they possess is too valuable to the panel to wait and they anticipated it would be a process getting what they need. \u201cOur problem is we can\u2019t wait forever for people to talk. We have to get information,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cSo, this is a matter of cutting the time allotted for the committee to do its work to get it done.\u201d All four of the former Trump staffers were part of a larger records request the committee had sent to government agencies last month when it requested the records of hundreds of former Trump staffers, campaign employees and supporters who played a role in either spreading misinformation around the 2020 election results or the planning of the \u201cStop the Steal\u201d rally that served as a prelude to the riot at the Capitol, as well as those who played a role in the security response that day. The National Archives, which serves as the custodian of the Trump administration White House records, told CNN earlier Thursday that it had no comment on whether it had been contacted by members of Trump\u2019s orbit or the White House regarding executive privilege. \u201cWe have no comment, no comment, since we consider the entire PRA notification process to be deliberative until a final decision is made,\u201d a spokesperson told CNN. The subpoenas to the four Trump loyalists underscore an effort by the committee to understand what the former President knew in the lead-up to January 6 and in its direct aftermath, based on those who were closest to him in that period of time. The information the committee is seeking also points to a clear interest in learning more about what Trump and those around him attempted to do to overturn the results of the 2020 presidential election. As partisan Arizona election review ends, Republicans try copycat tactics in other states In the letter to Bannon, the committee cites communications he had with Trump on December 30, 2020, \u201cand potentially other occasions\u201d in which Bannon reportedly urged the former President \u201cto plan for and focus his efforts on January 6.\u201d The committee also references Bannon\u2019s incendiary comments made on his podcast on January 5, in which he said \u201call hell is going to break loose tomorrow.\u201d To Meadows, the committee wrote, \u201cThe investigation has revealed credible evidence of your involvement in events within the scope of the Select Committee\u2019s inquiry,\u201d citing his close proximity to Trump on the day of the attack. The committee also said it is pressing to learn more about Meadows\u2019 efforts to aid in overturning the 2020 presidential election, and noted it has evidence that shows Meadows communicated with \u201cthe highest officials at the Department of Justice requesting investigations into election fraud matters in several states,\u201d citing documents it has received from DOJ. The committee, citing documents it has obtained, told Patel \u201cthere is substantial reason to believe\u201d that he has important insight and information into how the Department of Defense and White House prepared for and responded to the attack at the US Capitol. The committee also said it wants to learn more about the direct communication Patel had with Meadows on the day of the insurrection. In its letter to Scavino, the committee said it \u201chas reason to believe that you have information relevant to understanding important activities that led to and informed the events at the Capitol on January 6, 2021, and relevant to former President Trump\u2019s activities and communications in the period leading up to and on January 6th.\u201d The committee also cites Scavino\u2019s long history of working for Trump as key to providing important insight into how the former President handled the January 6 insurrection and efforts to overturn the election. The committee also cited an example of Scavino\u2019s tweets that indicated he encouraged participants to \u201cbe a part of history\u201d on the day of the riot. 'Incredibly dangerous': Trump is trying to get Big Lie promoters chosen to run the 2024 election Republican Rep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois, one of two Republicans serving on the committee, tweeted after the subpoenas were delivered that he is looking \u201cforward to getting a full accounting of everything that happened in the Trump White House on, before, and after January 6th.\u201d \u201cAnd we\u2019re just getting started,\u201d he added. House Intelligence Chairman Adam Schiff said Thursday evening that he hopes the committee will move swiftly to enforce the subpoenas should any of the witnesses defy them and that \u201cthe Justice Department will be open to considering potential criminal contempt charges against anyone who ignores the law.\u201d Speaking with CNN\u2019s Chris Cuomo on \u201cPrime Time,\u201d Schiff said that \u201cunlike the last four years, these witnesses are not going to be able to count on the former President to protect them if they, essentially, thwart the law.\u201d The subpoenas, he said, show the committee is \u201cmoving with great alacrity.\u201d \u201cAnd essentially, no one is off the table. We are going to determine what went wrong in the lead-up to January 6. We\u2019re going to find out who was involved, who was knowledgeable, what roles they played in the planning, what expectation they had of violence, what the former President was doing,\u201d the California Democrat added. \u201cAmong the biggest unknowns was what was going on within the White House, on January 5th and 6th, at that critical time when our democracy was being threatened with violent insurrection. So we are not wasting time.\u201d This story has been updated with additional developments Friday. CNN\u2019s Zachary Cohen, Manu Raju and Paul LeBlanc contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "The White House is taking steps to release information to a congressional committee investigating the January 6 attack on the Capitol about what former President Donald Trump and his aides were doing as violence erupted that day, a decision that is likely to set up a legal fight with the former President and raise questions of executive privilege for anyone who serves in the Oval Office. \u201cAs President Biden has said, the events of January 6th were a dark stain on our country\u2019s history, and they represented an attack on the foundations of our constitution and democracy in a way that few other events have,\u201d White House spokesman Michael Gwin said in a statement to CNN. \u201cThe President is deeply committed to ensuring that something like that can never happen again and he supports a thorough investigation into what occurred,\u201d Gwin said. \u201cThat\u2019s why his Administration has been engaging with Congress on matters relating to January 6 for several months now and will continue to do so, including with the Select Committee.\u201d Late last month, Trump threatened to invoke executive privilege in an effort to block the House select committee investigating the Capitol riot from obtaining a massive tranche of documents it\u2019s demanding from several US government agencies, despite his successor having the ultimate say over whether the information can be shared. The House select committee has launched a sweeping investigation into January 6. As part of that, the panel has sent requests for information from a number of federal agencies, including the National Archives, the custodian of the Trump administration White House records. The committee asked for \u201call documents and communications within the White House\u201d on that day, including call logs, schedules and meetings with top officials and outside advisers, including Rudy Giuliani. The Biden White House is inclined to limit how much it asserts executive privilege in that investigation, according to sources familiar with the administration\u2019s thinking. Such a stance eases the way for House investigators to get access to a trove of documents and to seek testimony from top White House officials from the previous administration. But any decision from the Biden White House could still run into legal challenges from Trump and members of his administration whose testimony is likely to be sought, possibly delaying any access by investigators. Biden has the ultimate say on whether executive privilege can be waived, but in many ways, this is new legal territory. In anticipation of subpoenas from the select committee, White House and Justice Department lawyers have been meeting to outline where the Biden administration will draw the line on executive privilege. It\u2019s a thorny issue because the decision could set a new precedent for future presidents and their administrations \u2013 potentially giving a future GOP-controlled Congress access to materials from a Democrat-led executive branch. An early indication of the Biden administration\u2019s thinking emerged in recent months in letters allowing former Trump officials to provide testimony to other congressional committees investigating the January 6 attack. \u201cThe extraordinary events in this matter constitute exceptional circumstances warranting an accommodation to Congress,\u201d administration lawyers wrote in a letter in July to former Justice Department officials. Several former Trump Justice Department officials did provide interviews to Congress on their communications with the former President in the weeks before January 6, breaking with general practice to shield those internal deliberations. The letters to former Justice officials read in part: \u201cPresident Biden has decided that it would not be appropriate to assert executive privilege with respect to communications with former President Trump and his advisors and staff\u201d related to the post-Election Day efforts by the former President to overturn the election results.",

            "article_content": "Former President Donald Trump on Wednesday threatened to invoke executive privilege in an effort to block the House select committee investigating the January 6 Capitol riot from obtaining a massive tranche of documents it\u2019s demanding from several US government agencies, despite his successor having the ultimate say over whether the information can be shared. \u201cExecutive privilege will be defended, not just on behalf of my Administration and the Patriots who worked beside me, but on behalf of the Office of the President of the United States and the future of our Nation,\u201d Trump said in a statement, without detailing how such an effort would be conducted. The Biden administration has already declined to assert executive privilege over some testimony related to January 6, telling former Justice Department officials that they were free to provide \u201cunrestricted testimony.\u201d But the administration has not weighed in on whether the committee should have unrestricted access to records and documents from the Trump White House. The document requests from the House select committee echo those previously issued by other House committees in the aftermath of the January 6 riot, while significantly broadening the search to other areas and people inside and outside government. Specifically, the select committee is asking for records from the Department of Justice, Department of the Interior, Department of Defense, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the National Counterterrorism Center, the Department of Homeland Security and, perhaps most importantly, the National Archives \u2013 the custodian of the Trump administration White House records. The list of targets is long and varied, ranging from information about attempts to either carry out or defy Trump\u2019s orders, invoke the insurrection act, martial law or the 25th Amendment, as well as for communications regarding members of the Trump White House, campaign, January 5 and January 6 rally organizers, and even alleged members of far-right extremist groups such as the Proud Boys and the Oath Keepers. \u201cThe Select Committee to Investigate the January 6th Attack on the United States Capitol is examining the facts, circumstances, and causes of the January 6th attack. Our Constitution provides for a peaceful transfer of power, and this investigation seeks to evaluate threats to that process, identify lessons learned and recommend laws, policies, procedures, rules, or regulations necessary to protect our republic in the future,\u201d committee Chairman Rep. Bennie Thompson, a Democrat from Mississippi, wrote in a statement Wednesday. That message was echoed by Democratic Rep. Zoe Lofgren of California, another member of the committee, who told CNN\u2019s Kate Bolduan on \u201cOutFront\u201d Wednesday evening that \u201cthis is just the beginning.\u201d \u201cWe are trying to find out what happened leading up to January 6, the various elements, the reasoning, who instigated it, why they instigated it and the like. We want to find out every element of it, and so we\u2019ve made this request and this is, as I said, just the beginning. There are many other requests for documents that we will be making,\u201d Lofgren said. \u201cSome of these requests were made to these agencies by other committees in Congress earlier and they have not been responded to. So we need the information now and we\u2019ve made that clear to the various federal agencies.\u201d House committee plans to seek phone records in probe of January 6, including from members of Congress Several of the letters request \u201call documents and communications\u201d related in any way to Trump and members of his family who served in official roles at the White House, including: former First Lady Melania Trump and top advisers Ivanka Trump and Jared Kushner. Some of the former President\u2019s other children and their spouses, Donald Trump Jr., Eric Trump and Lara Trump, are named as well. The committee is also seeking records related to then-Vice President Mike Pence and a host of former White House officials, including former Chief of Staff Mark Meadows, as well as of the former President, who have questioned the validity of election results in key states where Trump lost. Among those listed are Rudy Giuliani, Michael Flynn, Steve Bannon and Roger Stone. As part of the sweeping records request, the committee has asked the Department of Justice for documents and communications involving discussions about challenging the validity of the election between Trump and former top DOJ officials, such as Jeffrey Rosen, Richard Donoghue, Patrick Hovakimian, Byung J.\u201dBJay\u201d Pak, Bobby Christine and Jeffrey Clark. The committee also requested communications between Trump or his allies and \u201cany DOJ official\u201d in the days before and after January 6. As part of that request, the committee asked for any documentation related to discussion of the 25th Amendment from November 3, 2020, to January 20, 2021. CNN previously reported that Clark, a Trump-appointed environment law chief for DOJ, was at the center of the former President\u2019s efforts to overturn the election, received a high-level intelligence briefing around New Year\u2019s 2021 that did little to stop his efforts to prove foreign interference had cost Trump reelection. Interviews with former Justice Department officials provide new details on Trump efforts to undermine election results He has emerged as a major figure in the narrative being written in documents and testimony from former Justice Department officials who were forced to fight off his efforts to orchestrate a coup of leadership at the Justice Department and use it to help the former President. Clark isn\u2019t scheduled yet for an interview with the House Select Committee. A source familiar with Clark\u2019s thinking told CNN earlier this month he is awaiting access to documents the committee has and to see whether a fight over the secrecy of presidential discussions materializes. In addition, the committee requested all documents and communications from individuals that could show DOJ intervention in litigation filed by the Trump campaign \u2013 or states seeking to challenge the election. On that list are Meadows as well as Trump lawyers and advisers, including Giuliani, Kurt Olsen, Sidney Powell, Jenna Ellis, Joseph diGenova, and Victoria Toensing. The committee also asked the Justice Department to provide documents that pertain to the certification of the election, including the role that Pence played in presiding over the Senate the day election results were certified. And the committee asked about any senior personnel changes at the Justice Department, including with presidential appointees, between November 3, 2020, and January 20, 2021. How a Trump environmental lawyer tried to weaponize the Justice Department to help the President The committee specifically requested all documentation pertaining to Clark, a former Trump appointee at the DOJ who has emerged as central to Trump\u2019s efforts to overturn the election. The committee also requested communication between then-Attorney General William Barr and attorneys investigating allegations of voter fraud. Targeting efforts to overturn the election results from within the White House, the committee is seeking records from the National Archives including all communication between White House officials and state government officials from hotly contested states such as Arizona, Georgia, Texas and Michigan. The officials include Arizona Gov. Doug Ducey, Georgia Gov. Brian Kemp, Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, chief investigator for Georgia Secretary of State Frances Watson, Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton, Michigan state Senate Majority Leader Mike Shirkey, former Michigan Speaker of the House Lee Chatfield, and Wayne County Board of Canvassers Chairwoman Monica Palmer. The panel is also demanding all communication related to Dominion Voting Systems Corp., which was the system used that became a primary target of voter fraud falsehoods. In its request to the National Archives, which houses all of Trump\u2019s records from his time as president, the select committee zeroes in on the paper trail it wants to obtain from the former President and his orbit. Based on how the panel\u2019s request is divided, it appears focused on examining whether the White House worked to delay or impede the counting of election results, what Trump knew about the election outcome versus what he stated publicly, the planning and recruitment around the January 6 rally, and if there were efforts to stop the peaceful transfer of power. The list surrounding Trump includes requests for call logs, telephone records, schedules and meetings for an expansive group including the Trump children \u2013 Ivanka, Eric and Donald Jr. \u2013 as well as Lara Trump, Jared Kushner, Melania Trump, Flynn, Stone, Giuliani, Stephen Miller, Marc Short, Hope Hicks and Kayleigh McEnany. January 6 committee considers whether to seek Trump White House call logs as investigators eye next steps Although the list does not name any members of Congress, the committee requests documentation on \u201cany Member of Congress or congressional staff\u201d who fits into this category of officials who were influential in maneuvering Trump\u2019s handling of the events of January 6. From the day of January 6 specifically, the committee requests all White House visitor logs, notations on movements of Trump and communications from the Situation Room. In terms of the security breakdowns related to January 6, the committee also asked the Justice Department for all documents related to its planning as well as decision making on when to deploy law enforcement personnel to the Capitol and discussion about the use of martial law. The committee goes as far as requesting all documents pertaining to \u201cthe mental stability\u201d of Trump or \u201chis fitness for office\u201d in the days between the insurrection and when he left office on January 20. The National Archives previously told CNN it possesses documents that are relevant to the committee\u2019s investigation and that there is a process \u201cby which the Congress and the incumbent administration may request access to records of former administrations.\u201d The committee\u2019s document requests could lead to potentially lengthy fights over access. President Joe Biden could seek to block the committee from receiving any of the documents by asserting executive privilege. January 6 committee considers whether to seek Trump White House call logs as investigators eye next steps And Trump could still try to go to court to stop the committee from obtaining documents from the Trump White House and testimony from people like former White House Chief of Staff Meadows. The question of executive privilege poses several potentially uncomfortable political scenarios for Biden. If he does assert privilege, the Democrat-led committee could pursue more extreme legal avenues to try to obtain the records. If he doesn\u2019t, that could set a precedent that opens his administration to expansive, Republican-led probes if the GOP wins either chamber in the midterm elections. CNN reported earlier this week that congressional investigators are also poised to send notices to various telecommunications companies requesting that they preserve the phone records of several people, including members of Congress. Rep. Thompson a Mississippi Democrat, said the panel plans to send notices to social media companies, too, though he declined to name which ones. \u201cI can tell you that we\u2019ll look at everything that will give us information on what happened on January 6,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cWe will look at all records at some point.\u201d This story has been updated with additional developments Wednesday.

            "article_content": "Senate Judiciary Chairman Dick Durbin said Sunday that former acting Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen revealed in testimony this weekend \u201cfrightening\u201d information about what had occurred at the Justice Department during the waning days of the Trump administration. \u201cHe told us a lot, seven hours of testimony. And I might quickly add: this was done on a bipartisan basis \u2013 Democratic staff and Republican legal staff asking questions during this period of time,\u201d Durbin, a Democrat from Illinois, told CNN\u2019s Dana Bash on \u201cState of the Union\u201d of the panel\u2019s interview with the former DOJ official. \u201cIt really is important that we ask these questions, because what was going on in the Department of Justice was frightening from a constitutional point of view,\u201d he added. \u201cTo think that (former Attorney General) Bill Barr left, resigned after he announced he didn\u2019t see irregularities in the election, and then his replacement was under extraordinary pressure \u2013 the President of the United States, even to the point where they were talking about replacing him, that pressure was on.\u201d Rosen and Richard Donoghue, the acting deputy attorney general from late December 2020 until the end of former President Donald Trump\u2019s term, provided to the panel detailed accounts of a tumultuous period in late December and early January during which a senior Justice Department lawyer sought to deploy the department\u2019s resources in support of false voting fraud claims by Trump, according to a source familiar. Pressed by Bash on what Rosen revealed during his testimony to the Senate committee, Durbin said he couldn\u2019t yet divulge any details, but that \u201cultimately, there will be a report.\u201d Interviews with former Justice Department officials provide new details on Trump efforts to undermine election results Rosen met with the committee for more than six hours on Saturday, while Donoghue met with them for about five hours Friday, the source said, adding that Rosen also sat with the Justice Department Inspector General\u2019s investigators Friday. Rosen spoke of numerous interactions with Jeffrey Clark, a Trump-appointed environment law chief at the DOJ, but much of the focus of his testimony was on five episodes in which Clark went out of the chain of command to push the fraud claims. That included the January 3 White House meeting where Trump had the two men vie for the attorney general\u2019s job before deciding not to replace Rosen with Clark. Asked by Bash whether Trump tried to get Rosen to overturn election results, Durbin replied: \u201cIt was not that direct, but he was asking him to do certain things related to states\u2019 election returns, which he refused to do.\u201d \u201cHe was being asked by the White House, the leadership in the White House, to meet with certain people who had these wild, bizarre theories of why that election wasn\u2019t valid. And he refused to do it,\u201d the chairman said. Both Rosen and Donoghue told the investigators that they don\u2019t know whether Clark was acting at Trump\u2019s behest or orchestrating a plot he concocted himself. The men testified that in their interactions with Trump, he didn\u2019t order them to do anything illegal and eventually accepted their advice that the Justice Department couldn\u2019t take actions to claim fraud when it had no evidence of it. Durbin\u2019s committee had previously reached out to Clark for an interview, even before Rosen and Donoghue spoke with its members, and his team is still in discussions with the panel, according to a person familiar with Clark. The senator told Bash on Sunday that he would like for Clark to testify but said he\u2019s not sure the lawyer would be willing to be interviewed. \u201cWe\u2019re going to do our best to ask Mr. Clark to come in and tell the story from his point of view,\u201d Durbin said. \u201c(Attorney General) Merrick Garland has opened the door and said, \u2018We\u2019re waiving all privilege here.\u2019 So he may decide for personal reasons or other reasons he doesn\u2019t want to testify. But I hope he will.\u201d This story has been updated with additional reporting. CNN\u2019s Evan Perez and Katelyn Polantz contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Jeffrey Clark, a Donald Trump-appointed environment law chief at the Justice Department at the center of the former President\u2019s efforts to overturn the election, received a high-level intelligence briefing around New Year\u2019s 2021 that did little to stop his efforts to prove foreign interference had cost Trump reelection. Clark is now a major figure in the narrative being written in documents and testimony from former Justice Department officials who were forced to fight off his efforts to orchestrate a coup of leadership at the Justice Department and use it to help the former President. The full picture of Trump's attempted coup is only starting to emerge A stark portrayal of Clark is emerging from former Trump-appointed officials who were alarmed by his backchannel efforts to the White House and to Trump allies, and who now are now providing testimony to congressional committees. Richard Donoghue, acting deputy attorney general beginning in late December, provided a closed-door interview to the Senate Judiciary Committee on Friday. Jeffrey Rosen, the acting attorney general at the time, is set to provide testimony in the coming days. A new House select committee examining events surrounding the January 6 Capitol attack also plans to ask for testimony from them and other witnesses. By late December, as Trump and his allies pushed conspiracies about alleged irregularities that he claimed stole the election from him, Clark told senior Justice officials that he knew of sensitive information that indicated Chinese intelligence used special kinds of thermometers to change results in machines tallying votes, people briefed on the matter said. The Justice Department by then had made clear it found no evidence of vote-changing in the election. Timeline: What Georgia prosecutors are looking at as they investigate Trump\u2019s efforts to overturn the election On Monday, December 28, Clark \u2013 who also became assistant attorney general for the Justice civil division as top officials left in the waning months of the administration \u2013 sent an unusual email to his bosses asking them to allow him to have a classified briefing, according to people briefed on the matter. At Rosen\u2019s request, then-Director of National Intelligence John Ratcliffe provided the briefing, which drew on classified findings not yet public that showed there was no evidence that foreign interference had affected vote tallies. Rosen and other officials had acceded to his request for a classified briefing out of belief it could put a stop to his unfounded claims of election fraud, according to some of the sources. Clark wasn\u2019t swayed by what he heard from Ratcliffe, a Trump loyalist who had stirred controversy with comments seeking to support Trump\u2019s pre-election foreign interference claims that China and Iran were working to elect Joe Biden just as Russia was trying to support Trump. While the intelligence community did find that China and Iran had developed a preference for Biden, and Iran in particular had taken steps intended to undercut Trump\u2019s reelection prospects, those efforts were characterized in a much different way than Russia\u2019s multi-faceted interference campaign. During the briefing, Clark expressed skepticism not of Ratcliffe\u2019s personal motives, but the analysis from the intelligence community that he was presenting, the source added. Clark believed some intelligence officials were withholding certain information from Ratcliffe because they were concerned about it being politicized by the Trump administration or certain policymakers, the source also said. An attorney for Clark declined to comment on the intelligence briefing. Ratcliffe declined to comment on the briefing. Clark also told colleagues he was in touch with sources who knew more, including someone Justice officials later determined was Rep. Scott Perry, a Trump ally from Pennsylvania who helped Clark get in touch with the former President. Justice Department rules limit contact between department officials and the White House, and Clark\u2019s contacts with Trump came as a shock to his superiors. Justice Department officials are also prohibited from discussing investigations with people outside of the department. Clark\u2019s December 28 email, obtained by the House Oversight Committee, was sent to Rosen and Donoghue and described how Clark wanted US intelligence information from the Director of National Intelligence so he could assess whether Chinese-made digital thermometers could connect with voting machines. \u201cI would like to have your authorization to get a classified briefing tomorrow from ODNI led by DNI Radcliffe on foreign election interference issues,\u201d Clark began his email, \u201chackers have evidence (in the public domain) that a Dominion machine accessed the Internet through a smart thermostat with a net connection trail leading back to China. ODNI may have additional classified evidence.\u201d Clark\u2019s email also included his draft proposal for the Justice Department to press the state of Georgia to convene a special session to investigate the election, and assurances that the Department of Justice would look into election fraud as well. ABC News first published a copy of the email this week. January 6 committee considers whether to seek Trump White House call logs as investigators eye next steps Donoghue and Rosen made clear they would not be signing or sending the letter to Georgia, and that the Justice Department would not be suggesting there was reason for a major election fraud investigation. Until last December, Clark had led an unremarkable tenure as the department\u2019s environmental law chief, one of many political appointees who didn\u2019t particularly stand out during his occasional attendance at brown bag lunches with colleagues convened by former Attorney General William Barr in the attorney general\u2019s dining room on the 5th floor of the Justice headquarters. People who worked with him called him cerebral and wonky about his legal specialty. He came to the department from the large, prestigious Kirkland & Ellis law firm where he worked for years with Rosen and Barr, but never made enough of a mark to earn a share in the partnership. A person who previously worked with him says Clark was the type of lawyer who took \u201cno\u201d to be an intellectual challenge to be proven wrong rather than a final answer. 'He's just making stuff up!': Berman reacts to Trump loyalist's letter Clark isn\u2019t scheduled yet for an interview with the House Select Committee investigating January 6 and is awaiting access to documents the committee has and to see whether a fight over the secrecy of presidential discussions materializes, according to a person familiar with Clark\u2019s thinking. Trump\u2019s private legal team has signaled it might go to court to fight for presidential privilege if the House pushes for more information than has already been agreed upon. That could open the door for Clark to refuse to testify as well. The Biden administration has signaled it won\u2019t try to block the House Committee in its inquiry into Trump\u2019s pressure on the Justice Department.

            "article_content": "The select committee investigating the January 6 insurrection is weighing whether to pursue call logs from the Trump White House on the day of the riot, a move that could present a potentially thorny dilemma for President Joe Biden who would ultimately have to determine whether the records should be covered by executive privilege or qualify as essential evidence for the ongoing probe. The committee has been engaged in ongoing discussions with the Biden administration about its plans for the investigation as it has taken the lead role in examining all things related to January 6 and prepares to issue its first round of subpoenas, two sources familiar with the matter told CNN. Phone records from former President Donald Trump\u2019s White House will likely not be among the first subpoena targets as a source familiar with the matter told CNN that the committee has not broached the topic during preliminary discussions with the Executive Branch. But the panel is actively considering the possibility of pursuing those records and other relevant documents that could raise additional executive privilege questions, the source added. Members of the committee, including GOP Rep. Liz Cheney, have made clear investigators must \u201cget to every piece of information that matters\u201d in order to piece together a detailed understanding of what Trump and his closest allies were doing that day. But what that will entail still remains unclear. Select committee chairman Bennie Thompson has declined to say specifically if investigators will bring in former Justice Department officials who were considered key witnesses in the probe led by the House Oversight and Judiciary committees, including former acting Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen. Rosen was set to be interviewed by the House Oversight and Judiciary committees this week but that plan was scrapped once House Speaker Nancy Pelosi decided to shift all January 6 investigative responsibilities over to the select panel. Still, the select committee has expressed an interest in speaking to former DOJ officials who have been linked to Trump\u2019s effort to push false voter fraud claims and could seek relevant White House call logs from the National Archives, which has legal custody of all the presidential records from Trump\u2019s time in office. The Archives acknowledged to CNN that it has possession of the Trump-era call logs and other potentially relevant records from the previous administration. In March, the Archives received a letter from several House committees \u201crequesting records related to the January 6, 2021, assault on the U.S. Capitol,\u201d but it is unclear whether White House call logs were considered part of that specific ask. Still, the Archives noted that there is a process \u201cby which the Congress and the incumbent administration may request access to records of former administrations.\u201d But doing so may be fraught with political challenges. Biden has the ultimate say over whether those phone records from the Trump White House can be shared with the committee or if doing so could compromise the privilege of the presidency itself. Deciding the latter could pose a potentially uncomfortable political scenario should the Democrat-led committee decide to pursue more extreme legal avenues in an attempt to obtain those records. A source familiar with ongoing engagement between the committee and Biden administration suggested the panel is still deciding if it wants to go down that road, telling CNN it is still \u201cTBD\u201d whether specific requests will be made during staff meetings with the executive branch. The Biden administration has formally declined to assert executive privilege over testimony related to January 6, telling former Justice Department officials in a letter they were free to provide \u201cunrestricted testimony,\u201d but it remains unclear if that view also applies to records and documents from the Trump White House. Trump can also assert executive privilege if the committee does ultimately request the records, though Biden would still have the opportunity to overrule him, according to federal regulations for presidential records managed by the National Archives. The process for requesting the call logs and other executive branch records begins with a court-established doctrine known as the \u201caccommodation process,\u201d according to Norm Eisen, who served as special counsel to the House Judiciary Committee for Trump\u2019s second impeachment and trial, during which investigators say the White House largely refused to hand over any relevant documents or records that were requested. \u201cFirst you have some combination of written requests and phone conversations to describe what you want, because of constitutional balance of power issues, both sides are supposed to work with each other informally. If that breaks down, you move to the subpoena process, if that breaks down, you go to court,\u201d Eisen, a CNN contributor, said. More than a dozen US Capitol rioters have now pleaded guilty Should Biden deem the White House call logs and other internal documents as being protected by executive privilege, the committee will then have to decide if it wants to challenge that decision through litigation \u2013 a move that would likely require a months-long court battle. So far, the Justice Department and the White House Counsel\u2019s Office are letting the six former DOJ officials who witnessed Trump\u2019s pressure on election fraud share what they know with Congress, because January 6 and what led to it is an \u201cexceptional situation\u201d in \u201cwhich the congressional need for information outweighs the Executive Branch\u2019s interest in maintaining confidentiality.\u201d \u201cThe Counsel\u2019s Office conveyed to the Department that President Biden has decided that it would not be appropriate to assert executive privilege with respect to communications with former President Trump and his advisors and staff on matters related to the scope of the Committees\u2019 proposed interviews,\u201d Associate Deputy Attorney General Bradley Weinsheimer wrote in a letter last month. There are also other ways the committee could potentially get its hands on those call logs. During Trump\u2019s second impeachment, House investigators faced obtained White House call records from the phone provider after the executive branch made clear it was not going to cooperate. Questions about how the committee will proceed with regards to potential subpoenas come as it has taken over key witness interviews that were just about to be conducted by another congressional panel. The select committee, which met virtually on Monday to discuss plans for the weeks ahead, is still in the process of hiring staff and determining the exact scope of its investigation, but members of the panel have already made clear it will issue \u201cquite a few\u201d subpoenas, likely by the end of August. Specific subpoena targets, however, remain unclear as members have expressed interest in hearing from anyone who might be able to shed light on Trump\u2019s whereabouts on January 6 and reviewing all relevant documents that might exist, including various memos written by senior Trump officials that have not yet been handed over. That includes former Department of Justice officials believed to have direct knowledge of efforts by Trump and his allies to overturn the 2020 presidential election \u2013 individuals emerged as potential witnesses in the more narrowly focused probe being conducted by the House Oversight and Judiciary committees. Those committees have already released hundreds of pages of documents and requested transcribed interviews from a host of former DOJ officials that could contribute meaningful testimony in the January 6 investigation, including: Some of the former officials who have already been contacted by the Oversight and Judiciary committees, including Rosen, Clark and Donoghue, also expected to hear from the January 6 panel, according to people briefed on the matter. Last week, Thompson, a Democratic congressman from Mississippi, declined to say if the panel would bring in Rosen and former Attorney General Bill Barr, but contended the Justice Department\u2019s decision to greenlight testimony from former officials who served at the department under Trump will make their job easier. \u201cWe are not putting names to it,\u201d he said. \u201cWe think it is important now that the process of accessing individuals is easier that is important for the committee. I appreciate DOJ\u2019s position on it ,and it makes the work of the committee that much easier.\u201d Thompson wouldn\u2019t say whom he wanted to subpoena. \u201cIt\u2019s early,\u201d he said. \u201cI can tell you that when we issue them, they will be part and parcel to the individuals who are germane to the investigation.\u201d Members of the select committee have also expressed interest in hearing from lawmakers who spoke to Trump on January 6, like House Speaker Kevin McCarthy and GOP Rep. Jim Jordan, as well as those who participated in the former president\u2019s rally that day, like Rep. Mo Brooks, suggesting they too could be subpoena targets. \u201cI\u2019m sure we will want to talk to members of Congress,\u201d Rep. Zoe Lofgren told CNN\u2019s John King on Sunday when asked about Brooks. She also said that \u201csounds like [Jordan] has something to hide,\u201d pushing back on Jordan\u2019s threats to us that the GOP would seek to depose Democrats Adam Schiff and Eric Swalwell in a Republican majority next Congress. But the committee may have a harder time securing testimony from Trump and aides such as former White House chief of staff Meadows, as well as McCarthy, Jordan and Brooks. Even if the Biden administration doesn\u2019t intervene, Trump could still try to go to court to stop the select committee from obtaining documents and testimony from the Trump White House by attempting to assert privilege, an effort that could delay the probe. Officials could also defy congressional subpoenas as they did frequently during the Trump administration. GOP Rep. Adam Kinzinger said on Sunday he expects the select committee to issue \u201ca significant number of subpoenas for a lot of people,\u201d in order to learn details of Trump\u2019s whereabouts on January 6, but indicated he would be reluctant to subpoena Trump himself immediately. \u201cWell, look, I don\u2019t know. Again, it\u2019s going to depend where the facts lead. We may not even have to talk to Donald Trump to get the information. There were tons of people around him, there were tons of people that were involved in the things that led up to January 6. Obviously if you talk to the President, the former President, that\u2019s going to have a whole new set of kind of, like, you know, everything associated with it,\u201d Kinzinger said, when asked on ABC This Week whether he would want to hear from the former President. Kinzinger struck a different note when asked whether he would support issuing subpoenas to McCarthy or Jordan, saying, when asked, that he would support subpoenas \u201cto anybody that can shed light\u201d on what Trump did on January 6. He added: \u201cIf that\u2019s the leader, that\u2019s the leader. If it\u2019s anybody that talked to the President, they could provide us with that information. I want to know what the president was doing every moment of that day.\u201d McCarthy has long been among those considered to be a likely subpoena target given previous reporting about his conversation with Trump on January 6. Interest in hearing testimony from Jordan has increased in recent weeks after a series of interviews during which he failed to directly address questions about the nature of his phone call with Trump on January 6. While subpoenaing Jordan could carry political risks, Democrats have left the door open to that possibility. \u201cThe odds go up every time he opens his mouth,\u201d one Democratic aide said about the possibility of issuing a subpoena to Jordan.

            "article_content": "House investigators have interviewed a former Justice Department official who drafted \u2013 but never sent \u2013 a resignation letter over what he said were former President Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cdirect instructions\u201d to use the department to support his false election fraud claims. Patrick Hovakimian, chief of staff to then-acting Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen, wrote the resignation letter January 3 in anticipation that Rosen would be fired at an extraordinary meeting that day with the former President at the White House, according to people briefed on the matter. ABC News: Trump loyalist at DOJ circulated draft Georgia letter with false election fraud claims \u201cThis evening, after Acting Attorney General Jeff Rosen over the course of the last week repeatedly refused the President\u2019s direct instructions to utilize the Department of Justice\u2019s law enforcement powers for improper ends, the President removed Jeff from the Department,\u201d the draft letter, reviewed by CNN, says. It\u2019s among a trove of Justice Department documents turned over to House and Senate committees investigating events that led up to the January 6 US Capitol attack by Trump supporters who believed Trump\u2019s false fraud claims. RELATED: Trump to DOJ last December: \u2018Just say that the election was corrupt + leave the rest to me\u2019 Hovakimian spent more than three hours Tuesday being interviewed by the House Oversight Committee. He is among several Justice officials, including Rosen and Richard Donoghue, former acting deputy attorney general, who are expected to provide interviews in the coming days. An attorney for Hovakimian declined to comment. The letter was addressed to top Justice officials but was never sent because Rosen survived the Trump meeting and stayed on until President Joe Biden\u2019s inauguration. About a half dozen officials had signaled plans to resign if Rosen had been ousted, according to people briefed on the matter, an event that would have recalled the Nixon era Saturday Night massacre. Trump to DOJ last December: 'Just say that the election was corrupt + leave the rest to me' At the time the letter was drafted, Trump was contemplating replacing Rosen with Jeffrey Clark, acting assistant attorney general for the Civil Division, who behind the scenes had made clear to Trump that he was amenable to carry out the president\u2019s wishes to pressure the state of Georgia to pursue fraud claims that the Justice Department had already investigated and found meritless. Clark had drafted a letter to be sent to Georgia officials laying out fraud concerns, but Rosen and Donoghue refused to send it. In an episode seemingly out of one of his reality television shows, Trump had Clark and Rosen come to the White House where for hours they essentially vied for the attorney general\u2019s job. For hours, Justice officials stood by waiting to hear the outcome of the meeting where Trump ultimately decided to not fire Rosen. READ: Notes from December 2020 phone call between Trump and Justice Department officials Clark is among the officials that the congressional committees have said they want to interview. CNN could not reach him for comment. The Justice Department cleared the former officials to provide testimony about their interactions with Trump, declining to invoke executive privilege. Doug Collins, a lawyer for Trump, sent a letter in recent days to the former officials saying that the former President wouldn\u2019t take further steps to block the testimony. But in a Fox News interview Tuesday, Collins said he hoped they would abide by the executive privilege restrictions, saying: \u201cThe former President still believes those are privileged communications that are covered by executive privilege.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Cuyahoga County Council member Shontel Brown will win the Democratic special primary in Ohio\u2019s 11th Congressional District, CNN projects. Brown\u2019s defeat of Nina Turner, the former state senator and close ally of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, is a flexing of the Democratic establishment\u2019s muscle, after South Carolina Rep. Jim Clyburn and the Congressional Black Caucus stepped in to campaign for Brown. Turner conceded to Brown Tuesday night. \u201cTonight my friends, we have looked across the promised land, but for this campaign, on this night, we will not cross the river,\u201d Turner said. It could be a sign that progressives\u2019 hopes of ousting other Democratic lawmakers in next year\u2019s primaries will encounter a stiff resistance from the party\u2019s establishment \u2013 backed by the same coalition of pragmatic Black voters and older, moderate White voters who carried President Joe Biden to victory in last year\u2019s presidential primary. Brown will be the heavy favorite to win the November 2 special election to replace former Rep. Marcia Fudge, who resigned to become President Joe Biden\u2019s secretary of housing and urban development, in the heavily Democratic district. Along with Brown and Turner, 11 other Democratic candidates were on the ballot. The race was a proxy for the larger generational and ideological battles Democrats are fighting in Washington. It drew Sanders, an independent who caucuses with the Democrats, and other leading progressives into the district to campaign for Turner, while Clyburn, the No. 3-ranking House Democrat, and other establishment-aligned figures descended on Cleveland to back Brown. Turner entered the race as the best-known candidate thanks to the national profile she developed as a top Sanders ally and television surrogate during the Vermont senator\u2019s two presidential campaigns. She is an ally of the \u201csquad,\u201d a group of progressive Democrats who are aiming to grow their ranks \u2013 and influence over the party\u2019s policy direction \u2013 in the 2022 midterm elections. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of other districts that are much more competitive \u2013 they don\u2019t have the privilege or the luxury to say \u2018Yes, \u2018Medicare for All.\u201d \u2018Yes, a Green New Deal,\u2019\u201d New York Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez said while campaigning with Turner. \u201cThere aren\u2019t too many districts like these that can lead the country. And so you all have the responsibility for all of us to help us add one more member to lead that fight.\u201d \u201cI need Nina,\u201d she said. \u201cPlease send me Nina. Please.\u201d But increasing the might of the party\u2019s left flank could come at the cost of other influential Democratic factions. The Congressional Black Caucus stepped in to back Brown, who has aligned herself more closely with President Joe Biden and largely praised his work during his first months in office. Clyburn \u2013 a kingmaker in the 2020 Democratic presidential race, where his endorsement catapulted Biden to a massive victory in the South Carolina primary that set Biden up to all but clinch the nomination on Super Tuesday just three days later \u2013 was drawn into the race after the rapper and activist Killer Mike, appearing with Turner, said the congressman was \u201cincredibly stupid\u201d for not having secured more commitments from Biden before endorsing him. The moment underscored the reality that \u2013 even as she ran a locally focused campaign \u2013 Turner could not escape the still simmering resentments of her previous work as one of the loudest left-wing critics of the party\u2019s establishment. As Turner campaigned on her calls for Medicare for All and a Green New Deal, Clyburn said he was opposed to \u201csloganeering\u201d and cited progressive calls to defund the police. In an interview as he campaigned with Brown last weekend, Clyburn said Biden needed as many allies in the House as he could get. \u201cI don\u2019t understand why people think that the entire agenda has got to be yours. That\u2019s not the way the world works,\u201d Clyburn told CNN. \u201cWe have to sit down, find common ground, reconcile the differences and move an agenda forward. That\u2019s what this President is doing and that\u2019s why he\u2019s been so successful.\u201d Brown, meanwhile, leaned into the image as someone who would arrive in Washington with relationships that could benefit the district. Though Fudge stayed out of the race, Brown\u2019s campaign aired a television ad featuring the next-best thing: Fudge\u2019s mother. In the ad, Fudge\u2019s mother says Brown is her daughter\u2019s protege. \u201cShe shares Marcia\u2019s values and will continue her legacy in Congress,\u201d she says.",

            "article_content": "Former President Donald Trump pressured acting Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen to declare that the election was corrupt in an attempt to help Republican members of Congress try to overturn the election result, according to notes of a December 2020 call Trump held with Rosen and acting deputy attorney general Richard Donoghue. During the December 27, 2020, call, Trump pressured Rosen and Donoghue to falsely declare the election \u201cillegal\u201d and \u201ccorrupt\u201d even after the Justice Department had not uncovered evidence of widespread voter fraud. \u201cJust say that the election was corrupt + leave the rest to me and the R. Congressmen,\u201d Trump said on the call, according to Donoghue\u2019s notes. Donoghue\u2019s contemporaneous notes were provided to the House Oversight Committee from call the Trump held with Rosen and Donoghue, who took over the top spots at DOJ in the final weeks of Trump\u2019s presidency following the resignation of Attorney General William Barr. READ: Notes from December 2020 phone call between Trump and Justice Department officials The notes are the latest evidence of Trump\u2019s efforts to pressure the Justice Department to support his false claims of election fraud as he tried to overturn his November loss to Joe Biden. Those efforts are now the subject of a new House select committee that\u2019s investigating the January 6 attack on the Capitol carried out by pro-Trump supporters to try to stop the certification of Biden\u2019s election win, in addition to the House Oversight Committee\u2019s investigation into Trump\u2019s baseless election fraud claims. \u201cThese handwritten notes show that President Trump directly instructed our nation\u2019s top law enforcement agency to take steps to overturn a free and fair election in the final days of his presidency,\u201d House Oversight Chairwoman Carolyn Maloney said in a statement. Trump on Saturday released a statement that criticized the House Democrats on the committee as \u201ccorrupt and highly partisan\u201d and denied the released documents showed attempts to help overturn the election. Trump\u2019s suggestion in the documents that he and Republican lawmakers would be able to intervene in the election result is the latest evidence that Trump believed he could overturn the election through the January 6 congressional certification of the Electoral College results, in which Trump\u2019s allies attempted to throw out the election results of several states. Trump also pressured then-Vice President Mike Pence to ignore the Constitution to prevent certification, criticizing Pence on Twitter at the same time that rioters had forced the vice president and lawmakers to evacuate the House and Senate chambers. Both Rosen and Donoghue could end up testifying before Congress about their interactions with Trump after the election, after the Justice Department this week told the House Oversight and Senate Judiciary Committees it was not asserting executive privilege over DOJ officials\u2019 January 6 communications with Trump. That guidance could also apply to the select committee, which has been in touch with Rosen, according to a source familiar with the discussions. The documents were first reported by The New York Times. Donoghue\u2019s notes show how Trump continued to push false claims of voter fraud in several states. Trump said that \u201cpeople are angry\u201d and blaming the Justice Department for inaction, suggesting that \u2013 blaming DOJ + for inaction.\u201d \u201cWe have an obligation to tell people that this was an illegal, corrupt election,\u201d Trump said, according to the notes. Rosen and Donoghue\u2019s pushed back, telling Trump \u201cWe are doing our job. Much of the info you\u2019re getting is false,\u201d according to Donoghue\u2019s notes. The notes included a reference to Trump\u2019s false claim that the error rate of ballot counting in Michigan was 68%, when in fact it was 0.0063%, or one-in-15,000. Trump officials can testify on former President's actions leading up to insurrection, Justice Department decides \u201cYou guys may not be following the internet the way I do,\u201d Trump said, according to the notes. At another point, according to Donoghue\u2019s notes, Rosen told Trump to understand that the Justice Department \u201ccan\u2019t + won\u2019t snap its fingers + change the outcome of the election,\u201d adding that it \u201cdoesn\u2019t work that way.\u201d Trump suggested during the call that he might replace Rosen with then-Assistant Attorney General Jeffrey Clark, who had who reportedly urged Trump to make him acting attorney general instead of Rosen. \u201cPeople tell me Jeff Clark is great, I should put him in,\u201d Trump said, according to Rosen\u2019s notes. \u201cPeople want me to replace DOJ leadership.\u201d Clark had pushed Trump to remove Rosen and use the Justice Department to try to undo Georgia\u2019s election results, according to a New York Times report. Former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows asked Rosen to have Clark look into the alleged signature issues in Georgia, according to emails released last month, ahead of an Oval Office meeting on January 3 in which Trump heard directly from Clark and Rosen before ultimately choosing not to remove Rosen.

            "article_content": "Investigators on the House\u2019s January 6 select committee, vowing a deep dive into the attack on the US Capitol, may soon be confronted with a grim reality: A battle over subpoena requests and the prospect they could end up in protracted legal fights. Both Democrats and Republicans on the select committee say they want to obtain all the communications at the White House and conversations with Donald Trump that occurred surrounding January 6, but there\u2019s an expectation they won\u2019t get much cooperation from the former President, his former White House aides and his allies in Congress who have blasted the investigation. At the same time, they did get a significant boost this week when the Biden Justice Department formally declined to assert executive privilege over testimony related to January 6, telling former DOJ officials in a letter they were free to provide \u201cunrestricted testimony.\u201d But whether former Trump White House officials could be protected by executive privilege remained unclear. The DOJ decision means the committee could get officials to testify like former acting Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen and former Attorney General William Barr, who were at the center of Trump\u2019s efforts to pressure the Justice Department to support his false claims of election fraud. The committee has been in touch with Rosen and other former DOJ officials, according to a source familiar with the communications. Fact checking claims January 6 was not an armed insurrection House Select Committee Chairman Bennie Thompson wasted little time after Tuesday\u2019s high-profile opening hearing to signal that his panel would soon begin issuing subpoenas to obtain testimony and documents, as his committee eyes phone records and other documents from the Trump administration. On Wednesday, Thompson told CNN the DOJ decision should speed up the committee\u2019s work. \u201cIt\u2019s very helpful. It minimizes a lot of potential roadblocks that could have been put in the way,\u201d the Mississippi Democrat said. But the committee may have a harder time securing testimony from Trump and aides such as former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows, as well as House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy and GOP Reps. Jim Jordan of Ohio and Mo Brooks of Alabama. Even if the Biden administration doesn\u2019t intervene, Trump could still try to go to court to stop the select committee from obtaining documents and testimony from the Trump White House by attempting to assert privilege, an effort that could delay the probe. Officials could also defy congressional subpoenas as they did frequently during the Trump administration. Asked by CNN Wednesday if he would testify before the select committee, Brooks said, \u201cI\u2019m not playing that game with you.\u201d Jordan on Wednesday said, \u201cI\u2019ve got nothing to hide,\u201d when asked if he would testify, but suggested that if Democrats tried to subpoena him, Republicans could respond by trying to depose Democrats like California Reps. Adam Schiff and Eric Swalwell should Republicans take the majority next year. \u201cIf they cross that bridge, they\u2019re opening up a whole new (standard),\u201d Jordan told CNN. Asked about the prospect of Trump going to court to stop his committee\u2019s subpoenas, Thompson said, \u201cThat\u2019s his decision. The committee is committed to getting all the facts and evidence that\u2019s available and we\u2019ll go to whatever effort and length available to us to get it.\u201d Committee members said Wednesday they were prepared to try to overcome whatever obstacles Trump may try to throw their direction. \u201cHe\u2019s a very litigious person, so he can do what he wants,\u201d said committee member Zoe Lofgren of California, who was part of the House Judiciary Committee\u2019s court battles with the Trump administration. GOP Rep. Liz Cheney downplayed the potential that the January 6 select committee could get tied up in a legal fight over subpoenaing Trump and his associates. \u201cLook I think that we absolutely, we\u2019ve got to make sure that we get to every piece of information that matters,\u201d she told CNN. \u201cAnd I think the speaker has been very clear that \u2013 and the chairman \u2013 that we\u2019re going to issue subpoenas quickly. That we\u2019re gonna enforce those subpoenas, and I think we\u2019ve gotta make sure that the facts \u2013 that we follow the facts.\u201d And Rep. Pete Aguilar, a committee member, said that the DOJ decision not to assert executive privilege over former Trump DOJ employees \u2013 like Rosen and Barr \u2013 opens the door to getting such testimony quickly. \u201cWe\u2019re going to continue to pull that thread and find out everything we can. There\u2019s a variety of public information that is already out there within the indictments within the testimonies that has been given to House and Senate committees, so we\u2019ll continue to comb through that and develop a work plan,\u201d Aguilar, a California Democrat, said. The Justice Department notified former officials in a letter Monday that they could give testimony related to January 6 that was \u201cirrespective of potential privilege,\u201d saying that the \u201cextraordinary events in this matter constitute exceptional circumstances warranting an accommodation to Congress in this case.\u201d The letter was written in response to a request from the House Oversight and Senate Judiciary committees asking DOJ to allow some former officials to testify about their interactions with Trump and other White House officials, and the select committee could seek similar testimony. Five takeaways from gripping officer testimony at the first January 6 hearing The letter also said that the Justice Department consulted with the White House counsel\u2019s office and that President Joe Biden decided it would not be appropriate to assert executive privilege for \u201ccommunications with former President Trump and his advisers and staff\u201d related to January 6, suggesting the administration could side with the committee when it seeks White House records. But the letter noted that the Biden administration\u2019s position was \u201cnotwithstanding the view of former President Trump\u2019s counsel\u201d on executive privilege, acknowledging the former President could intervene. Many of the committee members are no strangers to court battles with Trump over subpoenas. It took the Judiciary panel two years of litigation before reaching an agreement with former White House Counsel Don McGahn to testify in June. Lofgren said she was hopeful that the DOJ decision would expedite the process for the select committee. \u201cA lot of the assertions made by the prior president ended up being invalid, but it took a long time to litigate. So cutting to the chase and saying it\u2019s not valid does help,\u201d she said. At the select committee\u2019s first hearing, the focus of the testimony was on four officers who served on the front lines of January 6. But Thompson and other committee members signaled they plan to turn their sights to what was going on inside the Trump White House. Schiff, another committee member, said the \u201ccommittee was conferring on next steps\u201d and was working to develop the correct sequencing for the investigation. Thompson said this week that he\u2019s eyeing holding another hearing in August while the House is out of session, though he hasn\u2019t said yet what the topic may be or who might testify. But Thompson told CNN after Tuesday\u2019s hearing that the committee would go straight to issuing subpoenas, skipping the step of voluntarily asking for information, in an effort to speed up the process that was often drawn out when other House committees sought information from the Trump White House. \u201cLetters just lengthen the time,\u201d Thompson said. \u201cWe just want to get it all done.\u201d CNN\u2019s Evan Perez contributed to this report.",

The decision paves the way for some former Justice Department officials to testify on what they witnessed in the chaotic days between former President Donald Trump\u2019s November election loss and early January when he tried to use the Justice Department and other means to advance false claims that he won. Among the potential witnesses from which a special select committee investigating the January 6 insurrection is expected to seek testimony is Jeffrey Rosen, who was acting attorney general in late December and until the inauguration of President Joe Biden. 'The physical violence we experienced was horrific and devastating': Officers recount harrowing events of Capitol insurrection Rosen and other Justice officials were at the center of a pressure campaign by Trump and other White House officials to back his claims of vote fraud. Frustrated that the Justice Department didn\u2019t find evidence of fraud, Trump contemplated replacing Rosen with Jeffrey Clark, another Justice Department official who signaled support for the fraud claims. Rosen and a group of top Justice officials prepared to resign if Clark were made acting attorney general. The Justice Department\u2019s decision applies to former Justice employees. Other potential witnesses that the committee may want to hear from, such as former White House officials, may be subject to a different standard under executive privilege. DOJ notified former officials in a letter Monday that they were free to provide \u201cunrestricted testimony\u201d and \u201cirrespective of potential privilege,\u201d according to a copy of a letter reviewed by CNN. The House Oversight and Senate Judiciary committees had asked the department to allow some former officials to testify about their interactions with Trump and other White House officials, the letter said. The new select committee investigating the Capitol riot could seek similar testimony. \u201cThe extraordinary events in this matter constitute exceptional circumstances warranting an accommodation to Congress in this case,\u201d the letter from Bradley Weinsheimer, associate deputy attorney general, says. The letter notes that the department consulted with the White House Counsel\u2019s office, which conveyed President Joe Biden\u2019s decision not to invoke executive privilege. An attorney for Trump didn\u2019t immediately respond to a request for comment. The move is among two politically-sensitive matters facing Attorney General Merrick Garland this week. Later Tuesday, the Justice Department is facing a deadline to tell a federal judge whether it plans to shield Rep. Mo Brooks, who is a defendant in a lawsuit brought by Rep. Eric Swallwell over Brooks\u2019s incendiary rally speech to the pro-Trump crowd before the January 6 attack on the Capitol. Brooks has argued that the Justice Department should take over his defense because he was acting as a member of Congress at the political rally. Some liberals have been critical of Garland for his efforts to restore the Justice Department\u2019s institutional norms, which have included aligning with some Trump-era decisions made by the department. Among those: the Justice Department continued to defend the former President in a lawsuit brought by E. Jean Carroll, who accused Trump of sexually assaulting her and was suing the former President for defamation. This story has been updated with additional details from DOJ.",

            "article_content": "Federal authorities have arrested two men in California who allegedly wanted to start a movement to overthrow the government and discussed blowing up the Democratic headquarters in Sacramento in a new, major case of would-be domestic terrorists motivated by former President Donald Trump\u2019s election defeat. Five days before the presidential inauguration on January 20 \u2013 which prosecutors believe was to be a key date in the planning of the attack \u2013 the Justice Department apprehended one of the men who had amassed a large arsenal. Ian Benjamin Rogers, 45, of Napa, California, showed strong support for White supremacy and for Trump, and said in text messages he realized he would be labeled a domestic terrorist, according to Justice Department court filings. Donald Trump doesn't believe in coups. But if he did ... A man Rogers communicated with, Jarrod Copeland, 37, of Vallejo, California, was arrested in Sacramento this week, DOJ said. Court records citing extensive encrypted messages between Rogers and Copeland raise the alarm of how the men sought to inspire domestic terrorism toward Democrats \u2013 and how their anti-government motivations may still persist. In January, Rogers had told Copeland, \u201cI want to blow up a democrat building bad,\u201d and Copeland responded in agreement, writing, \u201cPlan attack.\u201d The pair discussed \u201cwar\u201d after President Joe Biden\u2019s inauguration, the Justice Department said. They also discussed attacking George Soros, a billionaire donor who supports liberal causes, and Twitter, which by then had removed Trump from the social media platform. \u201cI hope 45 goes to war if he doesn\u2019t I will,\u201d Rogers allegedly wrote. The larger idea, the FBI and prosecutors say, was for Rogers to become violent near where he lived, to prompt others into similar actions nationwide, according to the court record. Both men are charged with conspiracy to destroy by fire or explosive a building used or in affecting interstate commerce. Rogers also faces weapons charges after investigators found 49 firearms, thousands of rounds of ammunition and five pipe bombs at his home and business in January, shortly after they discussed the plan but before January 20, according to court records. One of the guns, investigators noted, appeared to be a replica of a fully automatic machine gun that Nazi troops had used during World War II, according to a charging document for Rogers. Rogers told investigators after his arrest the pipe bombs were for \u201centertainment.\u201d Secret Service intel briefings ahead of January 6 concluded there was no indication of civil disobedience Rogers and Copeland are currently being held in custody and have yet to be arraigned, and a federal prosecutor said Thursday they remain a threat. \u201cAll of the political and social conditions that motivated them to plan what they themselves described as a terrorist attack remain,\u201d the prosecutor write in a court filing. Rogers\u2019 attorney declined to comment, and it was not immediately clear if Copeland had a lawyer. Copeland is due in court in San Francisco on July 20. Prosecutors, national security officials and politicians have warned that after Trump and his allies ramped up his lies of a stolen election in November and after a mob of hundreds of Trump supporters attacked the US Capitol on January 6, their inflammatory rhetoric could lead to violence. An FBI agent specializing in domestic terrorism wrote in court about the messages, \u201cI believe that these latter messages indicate Rogers\u2019 belief that Trump (\u201c45\u201d) actually won the presidential election and should \u2018go to war\u2019 to ensure he remained in power.\u201d Prosecutors also say Rogers had written to Copeland months before, in November, that he wanted to \u201chit the enemy in the mouth\u201d with homemade explosives attacking the Governor\u2019s Mansion and the Democratic headquarters building in Sacramento, according to DOJ. Copeland had told Rogers he was in touch with an anti-government militia group and also made contact with a militia leader after Rogers\u2019 arrest, who advised him to delete his communications, which he allegedly did, the Justice Department also said. Porsches, Gucci rings and billions of robocalls: Inside the PAC operation that raised millions by impersonating Donald Trump Investigators found Rogers had a card that said \u201cwhite privilege trumps everything\u201d and that had other references to Trump. He also kept a sticker on his car window indicating support for the Three Percenters, a movement of pro-militia right-wing Americans who believe revolutionaries could overthrow the US government like in the American Revolution. In various searches, investigators found Copeland had rifles, a \u201cgo bag\u201d with a helmet, elbow and knee pads, ammunition magazines and zip tie handcuffs, and anabolic steroids. The zip ties, prosecutors say, were intended for the men\u2019s plot. \u201cThe fact that he still had them six months later indicates that he still believed a situation would arise where he would need to take prisoners,\u201d a Justice Department court filing this week said. \u201cHis sentiments are deeply felt and long-standing and reflect a belief that the government is illegitimate. He is not likely to obey rules imposed on him by someone he views as part of a tyrannical government.\u201d Prosecutors note that Copeland served in the military but had deserted in 2016 under an \u201cother than honorable\u201d discharge. The single most revealing fact in the new Trump books \u201cIt doesn\u2019t matter for our purposes whether the steroids make Copeland more violent and aggressive, or he seeks out steroids because he tends to be more violent and aggressive. Either way, he is a greater danger to the community,\u201d prosecutors noted about the steroids. At first, Rogers\u2019 idea was to use Molotov cocktails and gasoline, and his a \u201cfirst target\u201d of the governor\u2019s mansion, because he believed it was empty and there would be no casualties. \u201cWould send a message,\u201d Rogers allegedly wrote to Copeland, according to the court record. \u201cThat\u2019s the best target I think too,\u201d Copeland responded. Prosecutors say Rogers then decided to change the target to the Democratic headquarters building in Sacramento. The two men allegedly made plans over the next two months, prosecutors say. They discussed pipe bombs and gallons of gasoline, among other violence at the building, according to their messages included in court records. Copeland later told investigators he wasn\u2019t taking Rogers seriously, though prosecutors allege he encouraged the other man\u2013and, according to court records, was an extremist who at times felt rage over politics that was aiding by him taking steroids. On December 1, Rogers said, \u201cDo you think something is wrong with me how I\u2019m excited to attack the Democrats?\u201d prosecutors told the court. Trump has repeatedly dismissed efforts to rein in his rhetoric. At one point, a Republican election official begged Trump a on national television to stop his verbal attacks on the election results. \u201cSomeone\u2019s going to get hurt, someone\u2019s going to get shot, someone\u2019s going to get killed,\u201d the official, Gabe Sterling of the Georgia Secretary of State office said on December 1. Trump responded to Sterling\u2019s comments with a tweet that doubled down on the false election claims. At a rally before the mob descended on the Capitol on January 6, Trump told his supporters that they needed to \u201cfight much harder\u201d and that they had to \u201cto show strength.\u201d \u201cWe fight like hell, and if you don\u2019t fight like hell, you\u2019re not going to have a country anymore,\u201d he said. In June, the Department of Homeland Security issued an intelligence bulletin issued an intelligence bulletin to state and local law enforcement partners about the increasing opportunities for violent extremist attacks this summer.

            "article_content": "The Trump administration\u2019s Justice Department secretly seized months of phone records from four New York Times reporters as part of a leak investigation, the newspaper reported Wednesday. The Biden administration disclosed to the newspaper that the Trump administration\u2019s Justice Department had seized nearly four months of phone records in 2017 from reporters Matt Apuzzo, Adam Goldman, Eric Lichtblau and Michael Schmidt. Officials had a court order to seize the group\u2019s email logs sans contents as well, but no records were obtained, according to the Times. The newspaper said the timing of the seized records and the reporters involved in the investigation suggest that the leak probe involved an April 22, 2017, Times report about former FBI Director James Comey\u2019s handling of different investigations during the 2016 election. \u201cSeizing the phone records of journalists profoundly undermines press freedom,\u201d Dean Baquet, the executive editor of The Times, told the newspaper in a statement. \u201cIt threatens to silence the sources we depend on to provide the public with essential information about what the government is doing.\u201d News of the seized phone records marks just the latest disclosure about the Trump administration\u2019s heavy-handed tactics toward leak investigations involving journalists. Trump administration secretly obtained CNN reporter's phone and email records The Justice Department informed CNN Pentagon correspondent Barbara Starr, in a May 13 letter, that prosecutors had obtained her phone and email records covering two months, from June 1, 2017, to July 31, 2017. The letter listed phone numbers for Starr\u2019s Pentagon extension, the CNN Pentagon booth and Starr\u2019s home and cell phones, as well as her work and personal email accounts. And three Washington Post reporters who covered the FBI\u2019s Russia investigation were told last month that last year the Justice Department had obtained their phone records from 2017. In 2018, the Justice Department disclosed it had also obtained 2017 phone and email communications from a reporter for BuzzFeed, Politico and The New York Times who had written stories about Russia. Justice Department spokesperson Anthony Coley told CNN in a statement that \u201ctoday, the Department of Justice notified four journalists that it obtained their phone toll records and sought to obtain non-content email records from 2017 as part of a criminal investigation into the unauthorized disclosure of classified information. The records at issue were sought in 2020 under Department regulations that apply to records of members of the news media, and the journalists were neither subjects nor targets of the investigation. \u201c He added that \u201cmembers of the news media have now been notified in every instance\u201d of leak investigations that took place in 2019 and 2020 involving reporters\u2019 records. President Joe Biden told CNN last month that he would not let his Department of Justice seize phone records or emails from reporters. Following a joint news conference with South Korean President Moon Jae-in in the White House East Room, Biden told CNN: \u201cWe should absolutely, positively \u2013 it\u2019s wrong, it\u2019s simply, simply wrong,\u201d adding, \u201cI will not let that happen.\u201d Under Justice Department regulations, the department can secretly obtain journalists\u2019 records through a court order, without the journalists knowing. The department laid out revised, slightly more stringent guidelines for issuing media subpoenas during the Obama administration in 2015, mandating that the attorney general had to authorize subpoenas when they related to the newsgathering activities of journalists. But the policy still provides the attorney general and other top department officials with wide latitude to seek communications from journalists \u2013 and to keep the matter secret initially. \u201cThe level of secrecy is something we\u2019ve been very focused on for years. From our perspective it impacts reporter source privilege and the protections for the reporter,\u201d Katie Townsend, legal director at the Reporters Committee for Freedom of the Press, previously told CNN. \u201cThese things are routinely filed under seal and kept under seal and maintained under seal indefinitely.\u201d In some cases, members of the media are notified before subpoenas are issued, giving the news organizations the ability to fight the subpoenas in court. But Justice Department policy also allows prosecutors to obtain journalists\u2019 communications without their knowledge through the courts \u2013 if the attorney general signs off and the department determines the case falls under \u201cextraordinary measures,\u201d such as harm to national security, and after all other reasonable attempts have been made to obtain the information elsewhere.

            "article_content": "Rep. Lucy McBath vividly remembers having \u201cthe talk\u201d with her teenage son Jordan in 2012 after 17-year-old Trayvon Martin was shot and killed. \u201cI said, \u2018Baby, you got to understand. You are a young, Black male, and there are people in this country that are not going to care about you or love you like us, your family, your community,\u2019\u201d the Democratic congresswoman from Georgia recalled. It\u2019s the conversation no parent wants to have, but so many Black mothers and fathers across this country feel it is a must. \u201c\u2018You have to be really careful where you are, what you do. Don\u2019t get into any verbal confrontation with anyone. \u2026 People will take out a gun and they will shoot you.\u2019 And I remember Jordan had said, with that bravado, \u2018Mom, that\u2019s not going to happen to me.\u2019\u201d Just nine months later, that\u2019s exactly what happened to him. Jordan was shot three times, killed by a White man at a gas station who was angry that Jordan and his friends were playing loud music. At 17, he was the same age as Martin. Forever seared in McBath\u2019s memory is the call she got from Jordan\u2019s father to tell her the gut-wrenching news. \u201cJordan\u2019s been shot,\u201d he told her. \u201cJust this primal wail came out of me, and I was like, \u2018Where\u2019s Jordan?\u2019 I just started screaming. Jordan\u2019s father said, he told me \u2018Jordan is dead,\u2019\u201d McBath said with tears welling in her eyes. \u201cI felt like in that moment that everything I had done to protect him, it wasn\u2019t good enough,\u201d she said. \u201cEverything I had thought I had done, putting him in the right community and putting him in the right schools and keeping him around the right kids, the right families, it didn\u2019t matter because he was a young Black male, and it was simply because of the color of his skin.\u201d The gunman in Jordan\u2019s case was sentenced to life in prison without parole, but gun violence continues to plague the US. A series of mass shootings across the country left at least 11 people dead and another 69 injured just over this past weekend alone. The month after Jordan\u2019s death, a gunman walked into Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, and killed 20 kids between the ages of six and seven \u2013 and six adults. A grassroots movement called Moms Demand Action was started in the wake of that tragedy to reduce gun violence in America, and McBath quickly joined in the fight. \u201cAny person that would allow me to speak or tell my story, that\u2019s what I did, because I wanted the world to know what happened to my child. And it wasn\u2019t right, and it wasn\u2019t only happening to my child, but it was happening to children and people all across the country,\u201d McBath explained. She redirected her pain into purpose. \u201cI was raised that you fight to protect and care for the people that you can believe in and that you love. You fight for your community. You fight for those that feel defenseless,\u201d she said. McBath was even invited to speak at the 2016 Democratic National Convention when Hillary Clinton was the Democratic nominee. She stood alongside seven mothers who had lost their children to gun violence or police brutality. She pledged her support for Clinton and promised to keep telling Jordan\u2019s story. \u201cWe\u2019re going to keep telling our children\u2019s stories and urging you to say their names,\u201d McBath said at the time. \u201cWe\u2019re going to keep building a future where police officers and communities of color work together in mutual respect to keep children, like Jordan, safe,\u201d she added on stage. McBath grew up in a house deeply rooted in the civil rights movement. Her father, Dr. Lucien H. Holman, was the Illinois branch president of the NAACP in the 1960s. \u201cI always joke and said he was the dentist by day, but he was the full-time, full-throttle activist for civil rights at night,\u201d she said. She grew up watching her father give speeches and taking car rides with her mother to deliver The Black Voice, a civil rights newspaper that he founded. She attended the 1963 March on Washington in a stroller. One of the first songs she ever learned to sing was \u201cWe Shall Overcome,\u201d because it was being sung all the time around her. Her home was filled with civil rights leaders trying to change America. \u201cThat\u2019s my background. That\u2019s my DNA,\u201d McBath said. \u201cI can remember at night as a small child, my house was filled with people and they were drinking and smoking and strategizing,\u201d she added. Her father even met with President Lyndon B. Johnson regarding the landmark 1964 Civil Rights Act. She sometimes wonders what her now deceased father would think of what happened to her son. \u201cMy father would probably roll over in his grave, both of my parents, if they knew that Jordan died in the same kinds of circumstances that they saw, that they fought so hard to eradicate,\u201d she said. McBath didn\u2019t follow her civil rights DNA for the first 30 years of her professional life. She was a flight attendant for Delta Airlines and didn\u2019t consider running for Congress until Valentine\u2019s Day 2018, when 17 people \u2013 including 14 students \u2013 were gunned down at Marjory Stoneman Douglas High School in Parkland, Florida. \u201cParkland happened, and I was furious. I was furious, because there again, we had Sandy Hook and nothing was done. There was no legislation, nothing was put in place,\u201d she said frustratedly. \u201cI thought, well, who\u2019s going to stand up for our children? Why are federal legislators even refusing, our state and local legislators? What are you afraid of?\u201d She decided to make a longshot run for Congress. No one ever told her the numbers looked good for her, but she went for it anyway, launching a campaign for Georgia\u2019s 6th District, which Democrats had failed to take in a high-profile special election the year before. \u201cI believed that, as a survivor and as a person who\u2019s living this tragedy every single day of my life, that there\u2019s so many other people around the country like me that are crying out for legislation, for policy, crying out for sensible legislation that protects our communities. And I\u2019ll find them, because they\u2019re out there,\u201d she said. She won \u2013 flipping her suburban Atlanta district from red to blue \u2013 part of the 2018 Democratic wave that helped return the speaker\u2019s gavel to Nancy Pelosi. The congresswoman, now in her second term and serving alongside a Senate Democratic majority and a Democrat in the White House, is hopeful real change will come on gun legislation. But she admits it is a \u201clong, long road.\u201d \u201cThe best opportunity that we have to evolve and put really good policy in place is right now, under this administration, but we\u2019re not going to get everything that we want. It just doesn\u2019t work that way. This is a cultural shift and change that we\u2019re dealing with, and that takes time. It does not happen overnight,\u201d she said. \u201cThis is not about taking away guns from law-abiding gun owners. It\u2019s never been that,\u201d she added. To be sure, her Georgia seat \u2013 which she won by more than 9 points last fall \u2013 is still competitive, and it\u2019s unclear how redistricting will affect her. Even more unknown is how Georgia\u2019s new, more restrictive voting law will play out in next year\u2019s midterms. \u201cShame on the Republican Party for putting these kinds of pieces of legislation in place that deters people\u2019s ability to vote. But, I just truly believe that people are undeterred, and they know how important it is,\u201d she said. On Capitol Hill, the fight continues on efforts to increase gun control amid a wave of gun violence and mass shootings that have emerged in recent weeks. There were at least 12 mass shootings between Friday night and Sunday, according to CNN reporting and an analysis of data from the Gun Violence Archive, local media and police reports. The shootings took place across eight states \u2013 Illinois, New Jersey, Ohio, Indiana, South Carolina, Virginia, Texas and Minnesota. Efforts to increase gun control have struggled to advance on Capitol Hill where legislation needs 60 votes to advance in the Senate. While the House passed a bill in March to expand background checks on all commercial gun sales, the Democratic senators leading the charge in the Senate \u2013 Chris Murphy of Connecticut \u2013 signaled to CNN last week that hopes were fading to secure a long-shot bipartisan deal in the chamber in the near future. McBath\u2019s personal experiences have shaped what she\u2019s fighting for in Congress. She is a two-time breast cancer survivor and experienced fertility issues, including having a still-born son before Jordan was born. \u201cI know how important it is to make sure that people like me, with pre-existing conditions, have access to the best quality health care that they can. If I didn\u2019t have it, I wouldn\u2019t be sitting here right now,\u201d she said, adding that that includes maternal health care. \u201cI understand what it\u2019s like not being able to have a child. And I was very fortunate in that I had excellent health care,\u201d she added. She wants to fight for women to make sure they have access to the care they need from the beginning of their pregnancies until the end. She said she was able to get all kinds of surgeries so that she could get \u201cone last chance\u201d to have a child, Jordan. \u201cThere\u2019s so many women that don\u2019t have access to good doctors. Food insecurity. They don\u2019t have transportation to go to-and-from their doctors. And every woman in this country, and I don\u2019t care where they come from, deserves to have. That is not a privilege, that is her right. And also, to care for the child, the baby. Women deserve that,\u201d she said. More women being elected to Congress, she said, will only help. \u201cIt\u2019s so important to have women at the table, so that we can speak about those things that are so critical. Not only to ourselves, but to our families and our communities,\u201d she said. Time does not heal all wounds. Almost a decade after her teenager was killed, McBath still opens her eyes each day and feels searing pain. \u201cI wake up every single morning and the first thought in my mind is that he\u2019s not here,\u201d she said. McBath keeps her son\u2019s memory alive by talking about him \u2013 especially how welcoming he was to new friends at school. \u201cI used to say all the time that my house looked like a mini United Nations, because he would bring the skinny leg jeans kid, the jock, the nerdy kid. I mean, he embraced all people, and he was so good at bringing them together,\u201d she recalled. McBath visits Jordan\u2019s gravesite often, and invited CNN to come with her. Pictures of Jordan at all ages are carved into his headstone \u2013 a snapshot of his short life. It\u2019s the place where McBath says she feels closest to him, where he really hears her. \u201cI feel like I can talk to him out here,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd then I tell him a lot. I said, \u2018I\u2019m trying to do everything I was raising you to do. So I can\u2019t be a hypocrite. And I got to try to get it right because that\u2019s what I was trying to teach you to do.\u2019\u201d \u201cAnd I cry. But I always ask him, \u2018Am I making you proud?\u2019\u201d she added. McBath is living the kind of life she hoped her son would \u2013 being concerned about and living life for others. \u201cThat is his legacy. Even though I thought I was sowing the seed into him to live that out, his legacy is my legacy.\u201d This story has been updated with additional developments Monday.",

            "article_content": "The ongoing battle between truth and lies, and the continued fallout from the January 6 insurrection, played out Wednesday on Capitol Hill with critical oversight hearings and a landmark vote among the House Republicans to oust Liz Cheney from their leadership ranks. The extraordinary day saw Cheney removed by voice vote in a 20-minute session that featured her fellow lawmakers booing her remarks about former President Donald Trump\u2019s falsehoods about election fraud and then having members mock her on social media. The vote to oust Liz Cheney took only 16 minutes. Here's what happened. RELATED: The vote to oust Liz Cheney took only 16 minutes. Here\u2019s what happened. A House Oversight Committee hearing about \u201cunexplained delays and unanswered questions\u201d from January 6, featured Republican lawmakers attempt to deny basic facts about the insurrection and saw former acting Defense Secretary Christopher Miller and former acting Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen resisting efforts to shed more light on Trump\u2019s response to the riot. The Senate also held a hearing on domestic extremism that shed light on homegrown threats. Here are six takeaways from Wednesday: At the insurrection hearing, some Republicans used their time to shamelessly defend the rioters and turn them into the victims instead of the perpetrators of a heinous attack on US democracy. The gaslighting came early from Arizona Rep. Paul Gosar and Georgia Rep. Jody Hice, who both voted to overturn results from key states even after the attack. Gosar said the crowd was full of \u201cpeaceful patriots,\u201d even though many brought weapons, dozens assaulted police, and hundreds have been charged with federal crimes. Hice suggested the violence was on the part of outside agitators. Liz Cheney ousted from GOP leadership role over Trump criticism In an incredible soft-on-crime moment, Gosar condemned the Justice Department investigation into the attack and complained that the FBI asked the public to help identify suspects. He and Hice rallied behind Ashli Babbitt, the QAnon-believing Trump supporter who was fatally shot by an officer while climbing through a window into an area where lawmakers were evacuating. Rep. Andrew Clyde, a Georgia Republican, said point-blank: \u201cThere was no insurrection.\u201d He added that TV footage of people in Statuary Hall taking pictures and video could be mistaken for tourists. \u201cIf you didn\u2019t know the TV footage was a video from January the six, you would actually think it was a normal tourist visit.\u201d The theme of the day became clear as the hearing progressed. The vast majority of House Republicans are still on board with the \u201cbig lie\u201d about 2020 and are willing to lie about January 6. Rosen revealed that he met with Trump on January 3, just three days before the insurrection. He said they didn\u2019t talk about the security planning for January 6, but he repeatedly refused to answer questions from House Oversight Committee Democrats about what he discussed with Trump at that meeting. Former Trump officials dodge questions about not defending US Capitol on January 6 as Republicans downplay riot \u201cI cannot tell you, consistent with my obligations today, about private conversations with the President, one way or the other,\u201d Rosen said, later saying he \u201ctried to be as forthcoming as I can\u201d but that there are \u201cground rules\u201d set by the Justice Department that he must \u201cabide by.\u201d Rosen did not elaborate on the alleged \u201cground rules\u201d and passed on opportunities to shed more light on the insurrection. This left Democrats stunned, including Rep. Gerry Connolly of Virginia, who pointed out that nobody invoked executive privilege before the hearing, and Rep. Kweisi Mfume of Maryland, who asked Rosen if Trump ever talked to him about overturning the results of the 2020 election. \u201cI think you\u2019re evading a question that most of America wants to know,\u201d Mfume said. The insurrection hearing descended into a useless shouting match, with most lawmakers peppering witnesses with \u201cgotcha\u201d questions instead of posing genuine fact-finding inquiries. Democrats tried, rather unsuccessfully, to get Miller and Rosen to criticize Trump. Republicans tried to get the witnesses to sign onto some of their dubious theories about the attack. Both sides used cherry-picked facts to push incomplete and inaccurate narratives about January 6. Rep. Stephen Lynch, a Massachusetts Democrat, tried to get Miller to blame Trump for the riot, which he did previously to VICE. When Miller partially walked back his critique, Lynch said he was reversing himself. But Miller responded, \u201cabsolutely not, that\u2019s ridiculous.\u201d Without missing a beat, Lynch retorted, \u201cyou\u2019re ridiculous.\u201d That dispute was a perfect example of why Congress appears unlikely to get to the bottom of what happened on its own. Partisan speeches and trick questions dominated the day. Very few new facts were unearthed. Everyone claimed they wanted to get to the truth, but when it was their turn to ask questions, most lawmakers repeated talking points and tried to dunk on the other party. A bipartisan array of former officials and experts have said a 9/11-style commission would be better suited to conduct a serious investigation, but efforts to launch a commission have stalled. Attorney General Merrick Garland was having none of the insurrection whitewash Wednesday, calling it the most \u201cdangerous threat to democracy\u201d at a hearing on the Senate side on domestic extremism. Asked whether the Justice Department should be prioritizing cases such as the Capitol riot against other federal prosecutions, Garland said there is no question that the riot should come first. Attorney General Garland and Homeland Security Secretary Mayorkas tout anti-domestic terror efforts \u201cIn my career as a judge and in law enforcement, I have not seen a more dangerous threat to democracy than the invasion of the Capitol,\u201d Garland said. \u201cThis was an attempt by some \u2026 to interfere with the fundamental passing element of our democracy, the peaceful transfer of power.\u201d \u201cAnd if there has to be a higher hierarchy of things that we prioritize, this would be the one we prioritize because it is the most dangerous threat to our democracy,\u201d Garland added, while also noting that the Justice Department would continue cracking down on other threats and crimes. The Justice Department has charged more than 415 people in connection with the riot. It took just 16 minutes for House Republicans to oust Cheney from her leadership position on Wednesday morning. The fight over her role in the Republican Party and its future is going to last much longer. The swift conference meeting that led to Cheney\u2019s dismissal underscored the desire among Republican leaders to wash their hands of Cheney\u2019s Trump criticisms, which they have argued is distracting from their goal of winning back the House in 2022. Cheney has made clear she has no intention of going quietly, and her dismissal from leadership will free her to speak her mind, and to condemn Trump\u2019s lies about the election that most of her House Republicans have embraced. Why the Liz Cheney vote won't be made public When she spoke to the GOP conference one last time as chair before the vote, she was booed when she criticized Trump once again. After the conference voted \u2013 by voice, rather than on the record \u2013 Cheney emerged from the meeting and declared she would now lead the fight for the future of the Republican Party. Cheney has effectively emerged as the biggest counterweight to Trump in the Republican Party, even if the House GOP conference\u2019s actions Wednesday show she\u2019s decidedly in the minority of Republicans when it comes to Trump. On the day the House voted to impeach Trump for a second time, one week after the insurrection at the Capitol, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy said that Trump bore some responsibility for the violence that had occurred on January 6. Four months later, McCarthy fully completed his embrace of Trump as he seeks to become House speaker in 2023. After criticizing Trump \u2013 and facing a backlash from the former President \u2013 McCarthy went to Mar-a-Lago to make amends with the former President. While he helped Cheney fend off a challenge to her leadership spot in February, he pushed the President\u2019s most vocal House Republican critic out the door on Wednesday. Kevin McCarthy just said something you won't believe about the 2020 election After Cheney\u2019s ouster, however, McCarthy sought to erase the GOP\u2019s opposition to Biden\u2019s win despite everything Republicans have said over the past few months and efforts in statehouses to curb voting access in the name of alleged voter fraud. \u201cI don\u2019t think anybody is questioning the legitimacy of the presidential election. I think that is all over,\u201d McCarthy said following a meeting at the White House with President Joe Biden and congressional leaders. Trump, of course, has done anything but give up his lies about the election being stolen from him. And now he\u2019ll have no one in House GOP leadership to call him on it.",

            "article_content": "With federal authorities now in possession of Rudy Giuliani\u2019s electronic devices as a result of search warrants executed on his Manhattan residence and office Wednesday, federal officials anticipate a court fight over their potentially privileged contents. Giuliani\u2019s lawyer, Robert Costello, raised alarms in the hours after the warrants were served on his client, who previously represented former President Donald Trump, saying the devices are \u201creplete with the material covered by the attorney-client privilege and other constitutional privileges.\u201d For more than two years, Giuliani has been the focus of an investigation in the Manhattan US Attorney\u2019s office concerning his activities in Ukraine, including whether he conducted illegal lobbying for Ukrainian officials while he pursued an investigation linked to Trump\u2019s primary political rival, then-candidate Joe Biden. While prosecutors months ago pursued inquiries regarding his work in other countries, according to people familiar with the matter, the probe is now focused primarily on his Ukraine-linked activities. What's happening with the Rudy Giuliani raids and Ukraine investigation Giuliani has denied wrongdoing, and in radio remarks on Thursday said, \u201cWhat they\u2019re doing to me as a lawyer is unconscionable.\u201d He added: \u201cI was representing my client when I did this \u2013 I wasn\u2019t representing any Ukrainians, I was representing Donald J Trump, President or not, an innocent man who was being framed by a bunch of crooks.\u201d In an interview hours later on Fox News, Giuliani said the search warrants were \u201cpurportedly based on one single failure to file for representing a Ukrainian national or official that I never represented.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve never represented a Ukrainian national or official before the United States government,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019ve declined it several times.\u201d He also accused federal prosecutors of having accessed his iCloud during the first impeachment of Trump, which centered on his and Giuliani\u2019s pursuit of an investigation of the Bidens in Ukraine, saying officials had employed \u201ctactics only known in a dictatorship, when you seize a lawyer\u2019s records right in the middle of his representation of his client. You should be prosecuted and disbarred for that.\u201d A spokesman for the Manhattan US Attorney\u2019s office declined to comment on Giuliani\u2019s public statements. The execution of search warrants represents a significant advancement of the Giuliani investigation, in part because of the high bar prosecutors must clear to obtain court approval for such warrants to be used on an attorney like Giuliani \u2013 himself a former US attorney \u2013 or Trump\u2019s other previous personal attorney, Michael Cohen, due to the likelihood of privileged material. With Giuliani, prosecutors are bracing for the same type of court challenge they faced in the investigation of Cohen, who balked at the seizure of material from his home, office and hotel room, claiming reams of documents were subject to attorney-client privilege. Biden says he was unaware of Giuliani raid: 'I give you my word, I was not' With the seizure of material from attorneys, prosecutors use a filter team \u2013 a set of lawyers who are not involved in the underlying investigation \u2013 to examine evidence and sort out privileged material, but in Cohen\u2019s case he argued that step was insufficient. Cohen\u2019s attorneys first sought a temporary restraining order to prevent investigators from reviewing the seized material. After a federal judge denied that request, Cohen\u2019s attorneys successfully sought the appointment of a \u201cspecial master,\u201d a court-appointed independent authority to review the material and determine which documents were privileged. The special master ultimately concluded that privilege applied to only a small portion of the thousands of pages of seized documents. While the execution of search warrants represents a significant advancement of the Giuliani investigation, it doesn\u2019t mean it is necessarily in its final stages. In part because of the expected court challenge regarding privilege claims, any charges against Giuliani aren\u2019t likely to be imminent and may not be filed for months, according to a person familiar with the matter. In Cohen\u2019s case, federal agents seized material from him in April 2018, the special master concluded her review on August 9 and federal prosecutors filed charges against Cohen just 12 days later. As with Cohen\u2019s case, any battle over privilege issues may attract the attention of their shared former client: Trump. Trump\u2019s lawyers joined in Cohen\u2019s effort to block the government\u2019s filter team review. In reacting Thursday to the Giuliani search warrants, Trump didn\u2019t voice privilege-related objections, but because he no longer occupies the White House he now faces even greater legal exposure than he did during the Cohen investigation. And the search warrant for multiple electronic devices comes at an interesting time for Giuliani and Trump. Last year, prosecutors in New York tried multiple times to obtain approval from Justice Department officials in Washington for the search warrant, including in advance of the 2020 election, but did not receive it. They ultimately did receive it at some point after Trump left office, and as a result of the delay, the seized material may include all sorts of records and communications that prosecutors might not have received if the warrants were approved earlier. Joe Biden warns democracy is still threatened and Trump's looming shadow proves it The phone, computers, and icloud accounts could include Trump and Giuliani\u2019s efforts to overturn the election results, including multiple court challenges and calls to state officials, and communications in advance of the January 6 riot on the US Capitol. While there is no indication the current investigation extends beyond Giuliani\u2019s efforts in Ukraine, prosecutors often expand investigations if they uncover evidence of another crime. This story has been updated with further comments from Giuliani. CNN\u2019s Kara Scannell contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Mike Pence has signed a multimillion-dollar, two-book deal with publisher Simon & Schuster, making him one of the first alums of former President Donald Trump\u2019s inner circle to ink such a lucrative contract. Two people in the publishing industry tell CNN the former vice president\u2019s deal is worth seven figures, somewhere in the range of $3 million to $4 million. News of it comes as the publishing industry grapples with questions of how to handle high-profile would-be authors from the Trump administration. The concern, according to highly placed sources in publishing, is whether the writers could be counted on to tell the truth \u2013 and whether a publisher might provoke a damaging backlash in the culture of cancellation. \u201cI would try to keep an open mind,\u201d said one publishing source. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t mean I would sign them.\u201d Recent veterans of the Trump administration who want to write books are already facing a higher bar than others for getting a contract, according to seven senior people who work in the book publishing industry. They agreed to speak candidly about trends in the industry in exchange for anonymity. Kellyanne Conway, the former counselor to Trump who left the White House last August, is also reportedly writing a book for a major publishing house. A representative for Pence declined to comment about a book deal, but the former Indiana governor is making moves to suggest he could run for president in 2024. On Wednesday, Pence announced he was launching a new political advocacy group called Advancing American Freedom. The proto-presidential campaign vehicle boasts a large advisory board of Trump allies and former administration officials, including Conway, Newt and Callista Gingrich, and Larry Kudlow. A book from Trump would likely be an instant best-seller, but publishers anticipate he\u2019ll expect an exorbitant advance and that the process of putting it together could be too difficult to make it worth the effort and money. Trump, major publishing executives say, would likely have to self-publish, especially if the smaller independent houses won\u2019t be able to pay a large enough advance. \u201cIt\u2019s not that the book wouldn\u2019t sell, it\u2019s that he is impossible to fact check or do business with,\u201d said one person at a major publishing house. A second person at a major publishing house said it would be hard to resist at least talking with Trump about a book. \u201cIt\u2019s the right thing to do. You\u2019re a professional. You hear what someone has to say, that doesn\u2019t mean you make a bid.  But there is a lot of money to be made, and that is an aphrodisiac,\u201d said this person. \u201cHe has a lot of followers.\u201d On the other hand, publishing a Trump book, say those who spoke to CNN, would likely have significant downsides that could outweigh the financial considerations of publishing a former president. \u201cIf word got out we even read the pages, or took a meeting, the collective conscious of the people on the ground in the publishing business would come in to play,\u201d said a third person at a major publishing house. \u201cStaff would leave, consumers, readers would leave, talent/authors would leave.\u201d One former publishing executive said the possibility of \u201ccancellation\u201d over publishing a Trump book is a real profit-and-loss consideration. \u201cThis is cancel culture P&L,\u201d said the former executive. \u201cThat is what they are really afraid of. They are worried about employees. There would be mass walkouts. No one would stay for Trump. No amount of money would be worth it.\u201d To a lesser degree, those fears also apply to books from Trump administration veterans. While publishers are likely to judge each book proposal on a case-by-case basis, sources say it will be particularly challenging for Trump officials who did not resign after the January 6 riot at the US Capitol. Another industry source who spoke to CNN said that former Secretary of State Mike Pompeo has met with agents to discuss the possible market for a book, although so far no deal seems to be in the works. The assumption that Pompeo is planning on running for president in 2024 is giving some publishers pause. A representative for Pompeo, who in March made his first trip to the early caucus state of Iowa, did not respond to requests for comment. There\u2019s little doubt among publishers that books from Trump\u2019s inner circle would have a market among the former President\u2019s supporters, and publishers say they have a responsibility to deliver books that promise to give a fuller picture of the administration. Sources in the industry say there\u2019s no firm rule or view that everyone who served and stayed alongside Trump is too toxic. Pence\u2019s new contract is a case in point. Also, other former Trump officials including John Bolton, Sarah Huckabee Sanders, and former White House aides Omarosa Manigault Newman and Cliff Simms have all published books with the major houses. But the Capitol riot, which occurred after Trump encouraged supporters to \u201cstop the steal\u201d and force the overturning of the 2020 election results, appears to have been a watershed moment in the book publishing industry. Days afterward, Simon & Schuster canceled a planned book by Missouri Sen. Josh Hawley, who objected to the counting of electoral votes on January 6. \u201cWe did not come to this decision lightly,\u201d the company said in a statement. \u201cAs a publisher it will always be our mission to amplify a variety of voices and viewpoints: at the same time we take seriously our larger public responsibility as citizens, and cannot support Senator Hawley after his role in what became a dangerous threat to our democracy and freedom.\u201d Hawley criticized the cancellation as a \u201cdirect assault on the First Amendment.\u201d He eventually found a new publisher for his book, the boutique conservative house Regnery. Trump officials looking to sell a book would likely have an easier path to publication through Regnery, said one industry source, though the payoff would be considerably less than from one of the major publishing houses. And self-publishing is likely only a viable option for people with the highest name identification, such as Trump himself or Donald Trump Jr., who self-published his most recent book, \u201cLiberal Privilege.\u201d (Trump Jr.\u2019s 2019 book, \u201cTriggered,\u201d was published by Hachette\u2019s conservative imprint Center Street, and was a New York Times bestseller. The Times reported that Trump Jr. rejected an offer from Hachette for his second book.) And while plenty of Trump associates might at least get a hearing from a publisher, it seems unlikely the industry would take seriously another proposal from the eldest Trump son. \u201cThat is not for a serious publishing house,\u201d said one industry source about any other books from Trump Jr. \u201cPompeo was secretary of state, [but] Donald Trump Jr. is Donald Trump Jr.\u201d CNN\u2019s Pamela Brown contributed to this story.",

            "article_content": "President Joe Biden on Tuesday unveiled a diverse slate of 11 judicial nominees, including three African American women for Circuit Court vacancies and a candidate who, if confirmed, would be the first Muslim federal judge in US history. The list, first reported by The Washington Post, is Biden\u2019s first wave of judicial nominations, and also includes candidates who, if confirmed, would serve as the first AAPI woman to serve on the US District Court for the District of DC and the first woman of color to serve as a federal judge for the District of Maryland, the White House said Tuesday. One nominee Biden announced Tuesday is Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson, who is picked to fill the seat of Merrick Garland on a powerful DC-based appellate court that is also a breeding ground for potential Supreme Court nominees. \u201cThis trailblazing slate of nominees draws from the very best and brightest minds of the American legal profession,\u201d Biden said in a statement. \u201cEach is deeply qualified and prepared to deliver justice faithfully under our Constitution and impartially to the American people \u2014 and together they represent the broad diversity of background, experience, and perspective that makes our nation strong.\u201d   The Biden administration pledged early on to prioritize judicial nominations and to cast a wide net seeking professional and demographic diversity, including those who had served as public defenders, civil rights lawyers and legal aid attorneys. During the campaign, Biden pledged to name the first African American woman to the Supreme Court should a vacancy arise. Tuesday\u2019s move will come as a welcome development for progressives eager to regain ground lost after former President Donald Trump placed more than 200 appointees in the courts, including three Supreme Court justices. Before taking the bench, Jackson, a 2013 Obama nominee to the US District Court of the District of Columbia, served as an assistant federal public defender, as well as a commissioner on the United States Sentencing Commission. She is a former clerk to Justice Stephen Breyer and is seen by some as a future Supreme Court nominee if a new vacancy were to arise. She is perhaps most known for her 2019 opinion ruling that former White House counsel Don McGahn must comply with a congressional subpoena concerning Russia\u2019s alleged interference into the 2016 presidential election. That case is still pending. Other names on the list of 11 include two other African American women. Jackson, an African American woman who is only 50 years old, has a degree from Harvard College and Harvard Law. She also served as an assistant federal public defender as well as the vice chair and commissioner on the United States Sentencing Commission. She did stints with large law firms to help support her family and gave an unusual speech at the University of Georgia School of Law in 2017 on a topic that underlines her particular story. Her talk, called \u201cReflections on my journey as a mother and a judge,\u201d illustrated how hard it is for mothers to serve in law firms that are often the stepping stones to judicial appointments. \u201cI don\u2019t think it is possible to overstate the degree of difficulty that many young women, and especially new mothers, face in the law firm context,\u201d she said. She noted that the hours are long and there is little control over the schedule which is \u201cconstantly in conflict with the needs of your children and your family.\u201d In 2019, she issued a 120-page opinion relying upon separation of powers principles to rule against the Trump\u2019s administration\u2019s attempts to block McGahn\u2019s congressional testimony. \u201cPresidents are not kings,\u201d she said, adding that the Trump administration\u2019s assertion that it had \u201cabsolute testimonial immunity\u201d protecting its senior level aides \u201cis a proposition that cannot be squared with core constitutional values\u201d and \u201ccannot be sustained.\u201d She held that \u201cindividuals who been subpoenaed for testimony by an authorized committee of Congress must appear for testimony in response to that subpoena\u2014i.e., they cannot ignore or defy congressional compulsory process, by order of the President or otherwise,\u201d although she stressed that such individuals are free to assert executive privilege in response to the questions asked of them. As things stand, there are currently 72 vacancies, according to the Administrative Office of the US courts and 28 future vacancies where judges have noted an intent to retire on a future date. Although the Biden administration has put strong emphasis on nominations, vowing to fill seats quickly to begin to make up for the more than 200 Trump appointees, there had been some grumbling from progressives that it wasn\u2019t moving quickly enough. That criticism should diminish with Tuesday\u2019s list.",

            "article_content": "A criminal investigation into former President Donald Trump\u2019s attempts to overturn the 2020 election results in Georgia is set to intensify this week, as a grand jury convenes, offering the local district attorney her first shot at seeking subpoenas for records and interviews. Fulton County District Attorney Fani Willis made her investigative intentions clear with a round of letters to Georgia state officials in February, asking them to preserve documents relevant to election interference as she investigated potential state crimes including the solicitation of election fraud, conspiracy, and racketeering. According to the letters, none of the Georgia officials are targets of the investigation. \u201cWhat I was doing, as a courtesy to people that I respect very much, is simply putting them on notice that when a grand jury convened, which would be in March, that they could expect to receive subpoenas,\u201d Willis told MSNBC in February. Two grand juries are set to convene in Fulton County on Thursday, opening a path for Willis\u2019 next phase in her probe. A person familiar with the investigation said they are likely to rely heavily on subpoenas rather than voluntary requests for records and interviews, in part to establish a clear court record of their pursuit of evidence. In the meantime, some officials in Georgia have already hired personal attorneys amid the fallout from Trump\u2019s efforts to upend the election results. While Willis\u2019 investigation launched from the now-infamous call in which Trump pushed Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to \u201cfind\u201d him enough votes to win the state, it\u2019s expected to stretch well beyond that single call. \u201cThere may be nothing there,\u201d said a person familiar with the investigation, \u201cor it may be more extensive that we thought.\u201d Willis has said her investigation will expand past Trump\u2019s call with Raffensperger to include any efforts to influence the election in Georgia. She is also investigating a phone call between Trump loyalist Sen. Lindsey Graham and Raffensperger, the abrupt departure of Byung \u201cBJay\u201d Pak, the US attorney for the Northern District of Georgia, and the false allegations of election fraud Rudy Giuliani made before Georgia legislators. \u201cThe way she goes about any cases, she starts at the top and she really dives into it. She follows every lead that she can and kind of exhausted in that way,\u201d said Charlie Bailey, who previously worked closely with Willis in the Fulton district attorney\u2019s office and is running for state attorney general in 2022. The former President\u2019s legal troubles began to mount in the wake of a stunning January 2 phone call. In the 62-minute call, Trump lambasted his fellow Republican for refusing to falsely say that Trump won the election in Georgia and repeatedly touted baseless claims of election fraud. \u201cThe people of Georgia are angry, the people of the country are angry. And there\u2019s nothing wrong with saying that, you know, um, that you\u2019ve recalculated,\u201d Trump said in one part of the call. Raffensperger, who repeatedly pushed back on the call, responded, \u201cWell, Mr. President, the challenge that you have is, the data you have is wrong.\u201d Trump pushed Raffensperger multiple times during the call to \u201cfind\u201d votes to reverse his election loss, while floating unfounded theories about why he won, and pressuring Raffensperger to look for ways to change the count. \u201cAll I want to do is this. I just want to find 11,780 votes, which is one more than we have. Because we won the state,\u201d Trump said. A person familiar with the investigation said Willis will not hesitate to dig into the details surrounding the call, even if Trump\u2019s team tries to claim various types of privilege to shield the former President from investigative inquiries. \u201cHaving a lawyer on a call is not a get out of jail free card,\u201d a person familiar with the investigation said. Trump\u2019s requests during that call came after 18 attempted calls from the White House to the Georgia Secretary of State\u2019s Office between the election and the January 2 phone call, according to a Georgia state official. \u201cThe repeated calls sort of start to tell the story that this was not, again, an official trying to talk to another official about problems that he or she might see in an election,\u201d Michael J. Moore, the former US attorney for the Middle District of Georgia between 2010 and 2015 under President Barack Obama, told CNN. \u201cThey paint a picture about intent and that\u2019s an important element for every prosecutor.\u201d Bret Williams, a former prosecutor for the Northern District of Georgia US Attorney\u2019s office, said the most serious crime that Trump is facing in Georgia is Criminal Solicitation to commit election fraud, a felony. But concluding a crime was committed could be \u201ccomplicated\u201d and boils to Trump\u2019s intent. \u201cHe might say, his lawyers might say, \u2018No, no, no. He\u2019s calling to complain. He\u2019s Kvetching. He\u2019s saying I got cheated,\u2019 \u201d Williams said. Trump\u2019s defense could be, \u201cI\u2019m not calling him to ask him to cheat for me, I\u2019m calling him to ask him to undo the cheating,\u201d Williams added. A spokesman for Trump did not respond to a request for comment for this story. In a previous statement to CNN on February 9, Trump\u2019s senior adviser Jason Miller said there was nothing \u201cimproper or untoward\u201d about the call between Trump and Raffensperger. \u201cIf Mr. Raffensperger didn\u2019t want to receive calls about the election, he shouldn\u2019t have run for secretary of state,\u201d Miller said in the statement. In the final days of the Trump administration, after numerous public attacks from Trump following the election, some members of the Secretary of State\u2019s office retained attorneys out of fear the then-President could leverage resources for political retaliation, a source with the office told CNN. And while Republican officials in Georgia have been eager to move beyond the drama of the election, they are expected to be drawn back into the investigation as Willis runs down the details surrounding the call with Raffensperger, as well as outreach from Trump and his GOP allies to other state officials In addition to his call with Raffensperger, Trump also had contact with Georgia\u2019s Attorney General Chris Carr and Georgia GOP Gov. Brian Kemp. In a call with Kemp last year, Trump pushed the governor to convene a special session and convince state legislators to overturn then President-elect Joe Biden\u2019s win in the state, a source familiar with the conversation told CNN. He also asked the Republican governor to order an audit of absentee ballot signatures. Kemp explained that he did not have the authority to order such an audit and denied the request to call a special session, the source said. Willis has said she also has questions about Graham\u2019s efforts in Georgia. Graham, a South Carolina Republican, was chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee when he called Raffensperger on November 13 and inquired whether Raffensperger could discard all mail-in ballots from counties that had shown higher rates of unmatched signatures, the Republican secretary of state told the Washington Post at the time. Graham has denied the assertions from Raffensperger, who has stood firm on his account. Graham\u2019s spokesman Kevin Bishop has said that accusations that the senator\u2019s call was inappropriate were \u201cridiculous.\u201d \u201cSenator Graham was asking about how the signature verification process worked,\u201d Bishop said. \u201cHe never asked the Secretary of State to disqualify a ballot cast by anyone.\u201d Willis has also expressed interest in exploring testimony from Giuliani before Georgia state senators, in which Giuliani promoted unfounded theories about why Trump won Georgia and a handful of other states that Trump had, in reality, lost. Giuliani told a room of mostly Republican lawmakers that Georgia\u2019s voting machines could not be trusted, tens of thousands of absentee ballots were illegally cast and not properly counted, and that the legislature should appoint its own electors who supported Trump. \u201cIt\u2019s your responsibility if a false and fraudulent count is submitted to the United States government, and it is clear that the count you have right now is false,\u201d Giuliani said during the hearing. In a statement to CNN, Giuliani said \u201cthe law gives you a lot of leeway to view the case in the light most favorable to your client.\u201d He added that any potential case against him \u201cwould be a travesty and fundamentally change the role of a lawyer and advocate. It\u2019s clearly a vindictive position, not unusual for those of us who supported and support President Trump.\u201d Georgia State Law Professor Clark D. Cunningham said Giuliani\u2019s claims may have violated the state\u2019s false statements statue, a felony. Cunningham says that Willis has all the elements of a \u201cvery persuasive\u201d story to try to and convince the grand jury that there was a conspiracy to change Georgia\u2019s election results. \u201cThere are lots of different pieces and they\u2019re different acts and different people involved,\u201d Cunningham said. \u201cLawsuits all over the place, hoping to find a judge who would issue a temporary restraining order, asking a general assembly to intervene, of course raising all kinds of allegations of fraud, pressure threatening the Governor, threatening the Secretary of State.\u201d Willis has also said she will take a look at Pak\u2019s surprise departure from his post as US attorney for the Northern District of Georgia in January. The move came after Trump appeared to refer to Pak as a \u201cnever-Trumper\u201d in the call with Raffensperger. \u201cI find it particularly peculiar the way that he left and when he left,\u201d Willis said in a February interview with the Associated Press. While Willis wasted no time in launching her investigation into the former President, she said during the AP interview that she has no set timeline for completing her inquiry. \u201cI\u2019m in no rush,\u201d she said. \u201cI think people think that I feel this immense pressure. I don\u2019t.\u201d CNN\u2019s Michael Warren contributed to this story.",

            "article_content": "Less than 24 hours after CNN broke the news that Donald Trump\u2019s legal team quit just a week before his second impeachment trial is set to begin, the ex-president sent out a press release announcing his new, new team. And it was something. The email subject line? \u201c45th President Donald J. Trump Announces Legal Team.\u201d It\u2019s first sentence? \u201c45th President Donald J. Trump today announced that highly respected trial lawyers David Schoen and Bruce L. Castor, Jr., will head his impeachment defense legal team, bringing national profiles and significant trial experience in high-profile cases to the effort.\u201d The second sentence? \u201cNotably, Schoen has already been working with the 45th President and other advisors to prepare for the upcoming trial, and both Schoen and Castor agree that this impeachment is unconstitutional - a fact 45 Senators voted in agreement with last week.\u201d The third sentence, which was a quote from Schoen: \u201c\u2018It is an honor to represent the 45th President, Donald J. Trump, and the United States Constitution,\u2019 said Schoen.\u201d How about the fourth sentence, a quote from Castor: \u201cCastor added, \u2018I consider it a privilege to represent the 45th President.\u2019\u201d And did I mention the email came from \u201c45 Office?\u201d This is, according to my armchair psychiatry degree, a classic case of overcompensating. Donald Trump very much wants to remind absolutely everyone who sees this press release \u2013 or quotes from it \u2013 that he was the 45th president of the United States. The 45th. Forty and then another five. Four dozen minus three. The guy after the 44th president. You know, the 45th president. There\u2019s of course more here. Trump never called and congratulated President Joe Biden for winning the 2020 election. Many have feared that Trump would continue to try to run a sort of shadow presidency from outside the White House for his followers \u2013 preserving the myth that he is still kind of, sort of president. (He is, um, not.) All of this \u201c45th President\u201d stuff feels like a step in that direction. And so, you get a press release like this one that mentions FIVE times in four paragraphs that he was the 45th president of the United States. It\u2019s more sad than anything else. But my guess is Trump doesn\u2019t see it that way.",

            "article_content": "President Donald Trump is considering having Rudy Giuliani and Alan Dershowitz defend him if he faces another impeachment trial, two sources familiar with the matter said. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said Friday Democrats are prepared to move forward with impeachment next week if Trump doesn\u2019t resign, and Trump is beginning to mull who would represent him in a Senate trial. Giuliani, Trump\u2019s personal attorney, is expected to represent him, the sources said, and Trump is also considering hiring Dershowitz, a controversial attorney. Dershowitz initially declined to comment to CNN, saying, \u201cI don\u2019t talk to CNN, I sue them.\u201d But he told Politico on Friday that it would be his \u201chonor and privilege\u201d to defend the President. Dershowitz called CNN after publication of this article and said he was referring to the \u201chonor and privilege\u201d of defending the Constitution, not the President. \u201cIt would be my honor and privilege to defend the Constitution of the United States and the First Amendment against partisan efforts to weaponize the Constitution,\u201d Dershowitz said. A Giuliani spokesperson did not immediately respond to a request for comment. While the President\u2019s impeachment defense team is only just coming into view, it is becoming increasingly clear that the primary members of the team during his first impeachment would be unlikely to join. Constitutional attorney Jay Sekulow, White House counsel Pat Cipollone and attorney Jane Raskin are not expected to be involved for a second impeachment trial. Cipollone is said to have considered resigning in recent days. House Democrats plan to introduce their impeachment resolution on Monday, when the House next comes into session. The latest draft of the impeachment resolution, obtained by CNN, includes one article of impeachment for \u201cincitement of insurrection.\u201d The House Rules Committee is expected to meet Monday or Tuesday to approve a rule that would govern floor debate for an impeachment resolution and Democratic Rep. Jamie Raskin\u2019s bill to create a new mechanism to invoke the 25th Amendment. But in a memo to fellow senators Friday, Majority Leader Mitch McConnell indicated that the earliest the Senate could take up any House-passed articles of impeachment would most likely be right after Trump\u2019s term ends, saying that the Senate cannot consider the articles while in recess. A growing number of Republicans want Trump to leave office before January 20, with some top lawmakers telling CNN they are considering supporting his impeachment. Two Republican members of Congress who are former Trump allies told CNN they would support impeachment against the President over his role in Wednesday\u2019s deadly attack on the US Capitol if the articles are reasonable. One member said, \u201cI think you will have GOP members vote for impeachment.\u201d GOP Sen. Pat Toomey \u2013 who is not running for reelection in 2022 \u2013 told Fox News on Saturday he believes Trump did commit \u201cimpeachable offenses,\u201d but did not say how he would vote if the article of impeachment came to the Senate. Sen. Lisa Murkowski, an Alaska Republican, was the first Senate Republican to call for Trump\u2019s resignation on Friday. \u201cI want him to resign. I want him out. He has caused enough damage,\u201d Murkowski said in an interview with the Anchorage Daily News published Friday. Sen. Ben Sasse, the Nebraska Republican who was an early critic of Trump\u2019s election fraud rhetoric, told CBS Morning News he\u2019d consider any articles of impeachment from the House.

The views expressed in this commentary are their own. View more opinion on CNN. Thursday, a federal appeals court opened the door to Congress receiving hundreds of critical documents about the January 6 insurrection \u2013 perhaps in time for Christmas. Former President Donald Trump went to court to block the release of those documents, but the DC Circuit Court of Appeals\u2019 careful and speedy decision was just the holiday gift our republic needed; on time and designed to stand the test of time. After Trump supporters stormed the US Capitol and disrupted the electoral vote count on January 6, the House of Representatives convened a select committee to investigate the attack and to recommend legislation to armor our democracy against future attempts to overturn our elections. In August, the committee asked the National Archives for Trump administration papers, including call logs, White House visitor records and other documents that may be related to the attack and its run-up. It did so with good reason, since the attackers sought to vindicate Trump\u2019s false claims about the election and since Trump initially egged them on with a speech calling for them to go to the Capitol and \u201cfight like hell.\u201d After careful review, President Joe Biden agreed to release the documents and to reject Trump\u2019s request to assert executive privilege. But Trump sued, claiming the release would somehow violate executive privilege, which protects communications between presidents and their advisors. A federal district court rejected Trump\u2019s request for a preliminary injunction, and he appealed. Now that appeal too has been swiftly rejected. What's missing from Biden's democracy summit Judge Patricia Millett\u2019s decision Thursday for a unanimous three-judge panel was probably Trump\u2019s last stop before the US Supreme Court, and given the decision, the high court may not give Trump much of a hearing. It is because this is not a difficult legal question, no matter how you look at it. Congress asked the National Archives for documents, in pursuit of an indisputably legitimate aim: It is hard to imagine what could be more central to Congress\u2019 mission than investigating and preventing mob insurrections aimed at disrupting Congress\u2019 business. The sitting president carefully evaluated that request and decided under the extraordinary circumstances here, releasing the documents is in the national interest. The representatives elected by the people have decided that the documents should be released, or as the appellate court put it, \u201cthe judgment of the Political Branches is unified as to these particular documents.\u201d In the face of the considered judgment of the people\u2019s representatives, the individual who was resoundingly defeated at the polls in November 2020 nevertheless sought to prevent disclosure by asserting the privilege of the presidency he no longer holds. But, as the appellate court held, \u201c[u]nder our Constitution we have one President at a time.\u201d Courts must defer to the sitting president\u2019s assessment of the national interest \u2013 especially when it aligns with Congress\u2019 determination \u2013 in the absence of a powerful showing to the contrary. The ominous signals Putin is sending Critically, as the new opinion emphasized, Trump has done nothing to show that Congress and the sitting president misunderstood or misapplied the national interest. Trump just asserts that he disagrees \u2013 but the court record contains not a single fact or argument to explain why Congress and President Biden are wrong as to any specific document. As the court put it: \u201che has not pointed to a single record\u201d whose release would somehow offend executive privilege. \u201cMr. Trump has made no record nor even hinted to this court what context or information has been overlooked or what information could override President Biden\u2019s calculus.\u201d The decision\u2019s wisdom goes deeper than its correct application of law, though. It is deeply rooted in the factual record; tied to a careful and modest understanding of the judiciary\u2019s role in our constitution; and \u2013 not least important \u2013 it came quickly. In its approach and its substance, this decision seems to have been written to be upheld by the US Supreme Court. (It even, in its conclusion, name-checks the title of Justice Neil Gorsuch\u2019s book). Trump\u2019s lawyers have already said the Supreme Court is their ultimate destination and the appellate court \u2013 even though it ruled against him \u2013 gave Trump 14 days to go to the Supreme Court and get an injunction against further disclosure. That period runs out on December 23. While one can never know what the high court will do, there is substantial reason to doubt they will step in. Substantively, Trump\u2019s arguments fly in the face of the logic and structure of our Constitution and law. As we at the States United Democracy Center laid out in an amicus brief filed in the case, Trump can no more take executive privilege with him than he could take the Resolute desk or Gilbert Stuart\u2019s portrait of Washington. What's behind the attacks on Dr. Fauci The Supreme Court shouldn\u2019t bother with this case and should decline to intervene, just as they do in the vast majority of cases. As they showed in the 2020 election, they are not necessarily willing to discard the law in favor of partisanship, even though six of nine were named by presidents of Trump\u2019s party, and three were his own nominees. The law here is no less clear than it was when they refused to hear cases advancing Trump\u2019s bogus claims about the election. The DC Circuit decision does not invent new legal tests or purport to make decisions about future Trump administration records requests. It simply says the courts need to defer to the political branches in the absence of any factual record showing as to why they should overturn Congress and the President. It is the kind of judicial modesty Chief Justice John Roberts has extolled, and it should protect the decision against reversal. The decision\u2019s speed is notable, too. Sixty-eight pages of careful analysis and forceful writing, handed down nine days after oral argument, shows the DC Circuit appreciates the urgency of Congress\u2019 inquiry. As we wrote in our amicus brief in this case: January 6 is not over. The attack on our elections is still ongoing in the states and Congress needs to propose solutions. This decision shows the courts can \u2013 and should \u2013 move quickly to ensure Congress has the information it needs to protect our democracy.  Finally, the new decision is also notable because it validates the January 6 committee\u2019s approach: deliberate, but vigorous and relentless. When taken together with Wednesday\u2019s news the New York Attorney General is subpoenaing Trump for a civil deposition in her investigation of his businesses, the day\u2019s legal news was very bad indeed for the former president. Trump\u2019s delay tactics, which served him so well while he was president, seem to be failing him now. It strikes an ominous note for those \u2013 like former Trump Chief of Staff Mark Meadows and ex-political advisor Steve Bannon \u2013 who are taking this same path. The decision sent a message: Going forward, presidents and their associates can\u2019t simply hide behind vague and substance-free assertions of privilege to block inquiry. It is not just a present for Congress. It is a gift to our republic.",

View more opinion on CNN. Just when you think you know the depth of former President Donald Trump\u2019s recklessness and arrogance, something new comes along to prove you don\u2019t. According to The Guardian, former White House Chief of Staff Mark Meadows reveals in a new book that Trump tested positive for the Covid-19 virus three day before his first debate with then-presidential candidate Joe Biden. The book says another test in that period came back negative. Meadows\u2019 revelation could mean the then-president entered the venue even though he might have been endangering the lives of everyone there. For Trump, all\u2019s fair in politics, it seems, including possibly exposing one\u2019s opponent to a deadly pathogen. On Wednesday, Trump issued a statement denying that he had Covid prior to the debate. The Guardian\u2019s source is an advance copy of \u201cThe Chief\u2019s Chief,\u201d a tell-all book by Meadows. While the report of a negative test is worth noting, the uncertainty over which test was correct should have led to caution. What reasonable person would hide all this and proceed as normal? Indeed, four days after the debate, Trump was rushed to Walter Reed National Military Medical Center for Covid care. As with so many things involving Trump, the truth of his illness was obscured. He was, in fact, much sicker than announced and required aggressive treatment. Mark Meadows reaches deal with January 6 committee Meadows\u2019 book, which will go on sale next week, may be viewed as a stab-in-the-back by his former boss and his most fervent allies. These folks will find more reason to curse Meadows as he cooperates with Congress\u2019s investigation of the violent January 6 attack on the Capitol by a mob of Trump\u2019s followers who, revved up by their man\u2019s speech at a rally, fought with police until they gained access to the building and forcibly delayed the formal acceptance of Biden\u2019s election victory. CNN broke the news that Meadows would cooperate with the select committee investigating the January 6 attack on Tuesday. Meadows\u2019 lawyer has said he may feel constrained to respect the former president\u2019s executive privilege claim that he can keep certain things secret, a legal question which is winding its way through the courts now. Nevertheless, he has already turned over some documents, and when he appears to testify, he will bring with him a true insider\u2019s knowledge of Trump\u2019s post-election drive to overturn his defeat, helping the committee piece together what happened before, during and after January 6. For those critics of Meadows who read the October 4, 2020, article about him published in Politico Magazine, passages citing his detractors, who regarded him as deceptive, may seem borne-out by his recent moves. Others, however, might say that Meadows has let his basic decency \u2013 another trait noted in Politico \u2013 finally rule his choices. How to solve the problem posed by Rep. Lauren Boebert Before Meadows was White House chief of staff, he spent seven years in Congress representing the 11th district of North Carolina. As Peter Eisner and I discovered when we researched a book on Trump\u2019s first impeachment, Meadows was well-liked in the House, even by some Democrats. He did not practice the politics of rage and contempt that characterized Trumpism. This signaled to some, including me, that Meadows might one day join Michael Cohen on the short list of Trump intimates who turned on him. Longtime lawyer to the billionaire businessman, Cohen spent years trying to intimidate people (including me) on Trump\u2019s behalf. Rewarded with good pay and lots of responsibilities, Cohen remained loyal as Trump became president. But as he came under investigation for the way he helped Trump deal with looming sex scandals, Cohen experienced a change of heart. After plea bargains on charges related to his work for Trump sent him to federal prison, he testified before Congress. He declared, \u201cI\u2019m not protecting Mr. Trump anymore.\u201d Cohen then spoke of Trump\u2019s behavior as that of a \u201ccon man\u201d and a \u201ccheat\u201d who directs unsavory schemes using code words. \u201cI understand the code,\u201d said Cohen, \u201cbecause I\u2019ve been around him for a decade.\u201d  Cohen testified to show that he was more than just Trump\u2019s flunky and to begin a new chapter in life where he might claim to occupy higher ground. Having dealt with him a little, and discerned some positive qualities, I wasn\u2019t surprised that he did it. The book he published later, \u201cDisloyal,\u201d continued this process as it revealed that the hold Trump had on him was truly broken and showed, in greater detail, his former employer\u2019s slippery and abusive behavior. Meadows\u2019 time for redemption is now, and he has taken a first step toward doing the right thing, which shouldn\u2019t be too much of a surprise for those who served with him in Congress. His critics will cry \u201ctraitor\u201d and declare him self-serving. Faced with being held in contempt for not responding to a congressional subpoena, Meadows is, of course, serving his own interests. But if he sheds more light on the dark months after last year\u2019s election, then he will have served the country, too.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Norman Eisen, a former ambassador to the Czech Republic and former President Barack Obama\u2019s \u201cethics czar,\u201d was special impeachment counsel to House Judiciary Committee in 2019-2020. Joanna Lydgate is the former chief deputy attorney general for the state of Massachusetts. Eisen is chair and Lydgate is CEO of the States United Democracy Center.Joshua Perry is Of Counsel with Perry Guha, LLP, a litigation boutique focused on complex civil and criminal trial practice and white collar investigations. Steve Bannon\u2019s relationship with former President Donald Trump has landed him in the dock, charged with criminal contempt of Congress.  Doubling down on his Trump-emulating defiance, Bannon has retained the ex-president\u2019s former lawyer, David Schoen \u2013 perhaps most famous for taking part in the defense in the second impeachment when seven members of Trump\u2019s own party voted to convict him. Legal analyst reacts to judge rejecting Trump's attempt to withhold documents Schoen is making the rounds offering Bannon\u2019s public defense: He was just following the advice of his (prior) lawyer, who told him to respect Trump\u2019s claims of executive privilege. But Schoen\u2019s arguments are no better now than they were during Trump\u2019s impeachment trial. It\u2019s worth taking the time to debunk them. First, Trump is no longer the president, and he doesn\u2019t get to invoke executive privilege to shield himself and his cronies from accountability. As Judge Tonya Chutkan held last week in denying Trump\u2019s attempt to block the National Archives from releasing January 6 documents: Presidents aren\u2019t kings \u2013 and Trump isn\u2019t even the president. The ex-president\u2019s invocation of the privilege is not a sufficient basis to take the law into your own hands and simply refuse to show up, as Bannon did. Trump helped Bannon evade accountability once, pardoning him after he was arrested for wire fraud. Not this time. Trump\u2019s attempt at invoking the privilege is especially weak here because he wasn\u2019t acting as chief executive when he planned and implemented his effort to overturn the election. He was acting as a defeated candidate, and there is no candidate privilege. Second, there\u2019s no such thing as podcaster privilege. Even if Trump could invoke the privilege, it wouldn\u2019t protect Bannon \u2013 he was a podcast host, not a White House advisor, on January 6. Bannon\u2019s whisperings with other conspirators also aren\u2019t Oval Office advice to the president. Third, Bannon can\u2019t hide behind his lawyer any more than he can hide behind Trump. Schoen claims that Bannon was merely acting on the advice of his lawyer, who told him to honor Trump\u2019s privilege invocation. But the majority of federal courts hold that reliance on a lawyer\u2019s advice isn\u2019t a defense to criminal contempt. The Godfather\u2019s Vito Corleone didn\u2019t get to break the law with impunity because Tom Hagen told him it was OK. Fourth, even if good faith reliance on a lawyer\u2019s advice were a defense, it wouldn\u2019t help Bannon. A person who wants to invoke a legitimate privilege in good faith doesn\u2019t simply ignore a subpoena. He responds on time, and he negotiates. He turns over all relevant documents that aren\u2019t covered by the privilege, and produces a privilege log indicating which documents he isn\u2019t turning over and why. He doesn\u2019t simply skip out on a scheduled deposition. He shows up, answers when he can, and invokes the privilege on a question-by-question basis. Michael Flynn's comments on Christianity are outrageous but not surprising Even with an executive privilege claim, the committee could plausibly pose questions that bear no connection to Trump, such as communications Bannon had with others outside the administration who were in a pre-insurrection \u201cwar room\u201d at the Willard Hotel in DC. Jeffrey Clark, a Justice Department lawyer who apparently collaborated with Trump in trying to overturn the election results, also sought to invoke the privilege \u2013 but he at least showed up at his deposition to do it. Bannon didn\u2019t, and he didn\u2019t negotiate either. He appears not to have even tried to act in good faith. It looks like he holds Congress in abundant contempt. Now it\u2019s officially mutual. Fifth, and finally, with no facts or law on his side, Schoen has resorted to claiming that Congress and the DOJ are just being unfair to his client. That\u2019s not going to cut it as a defense \u2013 try winning a selective prosecution defense \u2013 but it\u2019s also wrong on the facts. Bannon\u2019s own words have been even more damaging than his lawyer\u2019s. When he surrendered himself to the FBI on Monday, Bannon brazenly outlined his intent, \u201cI don\u2019t want anybody to take their eye off the ball\u2026We\u2019re taking down the Biden regime.\u201d Willfulness \u2013 an informed and deliberate refusal to comply \u2013 is required to prove criminal contempt. Look for the tape of those words to be played at trial to show bad intent. Judge Carl Nichols may be a Trump appointee, but it\u2019s hard to conceive that he would look kindly on Bannon\u2019s brazenness. Proof of that is his scathing decision against Trump\u2019s allies Rudy Giuliani, Sidney Powell and Mike Lindell, rejecting their effort to get Dominion Voting Systems\u2019 libel case against them thrown out.  It\u2019s true that criminal contempt prosecutions are rare. They should be. They\u2019re a big deal. But Bannon\u2019s flagrant contempt of Congress cries out for consequences. And our republic needs them. We are still looking for answers about what happened on January 6 and how to stop the ongoing attack waged by Bannon and his co-conspirators on the very idea of a democratic government.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Sign up to get our weekly column as a newsletter. We\u2019re looking back at the strongest, smartest opinion takes of the week from CNN and other outlets. In 1919, the English economist John Maynard Keynes called inflation a means by which \u201cgovernments can confiscate, secretly and unobserved, an important part of the wealth of their citizens.\u201d If allowed to run out of control, the falling value of currency turns \u201cthe process of wealth-getting\u2026into a gamble and a lottery.\u201d His warning came four years before inflation reached ruinous levels in the Weimar Republic, upending millions of lives and reducing the value of German marks so much that it took more than 4 trillion to equal one American dollar. In the century since, central banks have taken pains to keep inflation in check, and for decades they\u2019ve largely succeeded. But the global economic disruption sparked by the Covid-19 pandemic may have awakened the inflation monster. On Wednesday, the Bureau of Labor Statistics reported a 6.2% increase in consumer prices over the past 12 months \u2013 the biggest jump in 31 years. Food prices are up 5%, used cars up 26% and the normally volatile price of gasoline is up nearly 50% over the past year. Though no one is predicting Weimar-style hyperinflation, with many economists viewing it as a \u201ctransitory\u201d bump, the political danger is clear. President Joe Biden called the inflation surge \u201cworrisome,\u201d as Julian Zelizer noted. \u201cFor all the attention that has been paid to education wars, the anti-vaccination movement or the fallout from Afghanistan, prices might turn out to be the biggest issue going into 2022.\u201d He pointed out that even when inflation has been moderate \u2013 under 3% \u2013 Republicans were able to use it to score midterm election gains against Democrats in 1966. \u201cFor the sake of Democrats,\u201d Zelizer wrote, \u201cthe President will have to do more than say the situation is worrisome. He will need to forcefully address how he is dealing with these concerns and how his policies will help to alleviate, rather than aggravate, the underlying pressures causing Americans to pay more for their goods.\u201d Biden \u201chas lost some of the connection he made with voters who embraced him as a centrist leader who would not only restore a sense of normalcy and decency to the country, but would improve the lives of middle-class Americans of all political persuasions, working with leaders of both parties,\u201d wrote Frida Ghitis. The economy is in better shape than many Americans realize, Ghitis observed, pointing to falling unemployment and higher household bank balances, but Biden\u2019s salesmanship has fallen short. Why did inflation rear up? Economist Jeffrey D. Sachs ties it to the partial shutdown of the economy caused by the Covid-19 pandemic. \u201cWith tens of millions of service-sector jobs quickly ended, the government resorted to a massive transfer of income \u2013 payments to households and businesses funded by deficits \u2013 especially to keep household disposable income from plummeting. Money sent by the government to most Americans prevented the disastrous loss of income of tens of millions of households, which could have led to a massive collapse of consumer spending.\u201d As the pandemic eased, Americans had money to spend but the supply of things like new cars had been disrupted. The short-term boost in inflation, Sachs argued, \u201cshould be controlled by ending stimulus spending, tightening monetary policy, slashing the budget deficit and increasing OPEC monthly oil production to counter the recent surge in global oil and gas prices.\u201d But he urged Democrats to pass Biden\u2019s \u201cBuild Back Better\u201d social spending bill despite opposition from conservatives who say it will fuel inflation. \u201cIf BBB is paid for with taxes, then it won\u2019t add to the public debt or create long-term inflationary pressures.\u201d \u201cPresidents are not kings,\u201d wrote US District Court Judge Tanya Chutkan, \u201cand Plaintiff is not President.\u201d She ruled on Tuesday against former President Donald Trump, who was trying to stop the National Archives from turning over records to the House committee investigating the January 6 attack on the Capitol. \u201cOf course, she is right,\u201d wrote Michael D\u2019Antonio. \u201cOur government is set up with three branches to allow for checks and balances, and to prevent an all-powerful authoritarian from taking control. This scheme was fashioned by those who abhorred monarchy and sought to build a resilient democracy. Trump was, it seems, the president least interested in democracy and most envious of the world\u2019s dictators and strongmen, who are not burdened by oversight.\u201d On Thursday, a three-judge panel halted the planned turnover of records to give Trump\u2019s lawyers time to present arguments for an appeal. That is routine, wrote Norman Eisen, Joanna Lydgate and E. Danya Perry, but the courts need to act fast. \u201cThis case must not take years to percolate through the appellate courts as prior House subpoena cases have done. The House Committee investigating January 6 is doing everything it can to gather information quickly, and the nation deserves timely answers.\u201d \u201cTrump\u2019s claims are nonsense. He is likely to try to play out the clock in the hopes the House changes hands in 14 months and the subpoena is withdrawn before appeals are concluded. The appellate court should do everything it can to decide Trump\u2019s appeal quickly.\u201d For more: Peter Bergen: H.R. McMaster\u2019s different take on Jan. 6 \u201cDon\u2019t it always seem to go,\u201d Joni Mitchell sang, \u201cThat you don\u2019t know what you\u2019ve got till it\u2019s gone.\u201d In her 1970 hit, \u201cBig Yellow Taxi,\u201d Mitchell was lamenting paradise being paved over and replaced with a parking lot, but the sentiment applies more broadly. As Yaffa Fredrick wrote in CNN Opinion\u2019s \u201cVoices of Freedom\u201d project, \u201cMarina Nemat was only 13 years old when the freedom that she had taken for granted \u2013 singing in public, wearing a swimsuit at the beach and holding her boyfriend\u2019s hand \u2013 was suddenly taken away.\u201d \u201cBut what shocked Nemat the most was the speed of her nation\u2019s descent into a theocratic regime in 1979. Within a matter of months, she and her fellow Iranians lost the limited rights they had enjoyed under the country\u2019s previous government, itself a repressive monarchy. When Nemat dared to protest against the new regime, she was arrested and sent to the notorious Evin prison, where she would spend the next two-plus years, released just shy of 19 \u2013 alive, but deeply broken.\u201d Nemat was one of 13 dissidents who are telling their stories of fighting for democracy in \u201cVoices of Freedom,\u201d curated by Fredrick and Laura Juncadella. (Read Nemat\u2019s account of her life\u2019s journey.) Evan Mawarire, another dissident who contributed to the project, never tasted full freedom in his country, Zimbabwe, which suffered under the 37-year dictatorship of Robert Mugabe. \u201cIn 2016, Mawarire, now a pastor, concluded that the status quo in Zimbabwe could not stand,\u201d Fredrick wrote. \u201cCorruption was rampant, deflation had replaced hyperinflation, and free and fair elections were long gone.\u201d \u201cHis decision to post a video, in which he draped himself in the country\u2019s flag while giving an impassioned lament for the current state of Zimbabwe, was a huge risk\u2026 he got to the point where he realized \u2018no one else is going to fight for this country with as much passion and commitment as I am.\u2019 He was later imprisoned for his political activism and\u2026now lives in exile.\u201d Garry Kasparov became the world champion of chess at the age of 22 and has gone on to become an advocate for democracy worldwide. In August 2012, Kasparov recalled, he was \u201cspeaking to journalists outside the courthouse where three members of the punk collective Pussy Riot were being sentenced for criticizing Russian President Vladimir Putin in a music video filmed in a church. Suddenly, I was grabbed by the police. Videos captured the moment they tossed me, legs in the air, into the back of a police van. When I opened the unlocked door to ask what I was being charged with, they responded with a flurry of fists.\u201d Kasparov calls himself \u201clucky\u201d compared to the journalists and fellow dissidents who have lost their lives in the fight.  \u201cHailing from the Soviet Union, a repressive regime and precursor to Putin\u2019s Russia, I have always understood that democracy is a privilege \u2013 one that must constantly be defended.\u201d But with polls showing some Americans losing faith in democracy, Kasparov worries for the future. \u201cThe rights to vote and free speech are more vulnerable in my adopted home of America today than at any point in my life,\u201d he observed. \u201cThere is nothing wrong with American democracy that cannot be fixed by American democracy\u2026we can either be the generation that renews democracy, or loses it forever.\u201d For more: Nathan Law: Democracy is not only Hong Kong\u2019s fight Leopoldo L\u00f3pez: What I learned about freedom from inside a 2x2 Venezuelan prison cell Fatou Jaw Manneh: Our deepest fear for America \u2013 and the world Two trials, one in Wisconsin and one in Georgia, riveted the attention of Americans last week, and Peniel E. Joseph saw a through line between them. \u201cKyle Rittenhouse, the 18-year-old on trial in Kenosha, Wisconsin, for shooting three people and killing two of them, represents the epitome of White privilege in America run amok,\u201d Joseph said. \u201cRittenhouse, who has pleaded not guilty to six charges including reckless homicide, intentional homicide and attempted intentional homicide, cried during emotional testimony on Wednesday. Anyone watching the proceedings who was unfamiliar with the events that led to this trial would be forgiven for assuming that Rittenhouse was the victim of an unspeakable crime rather than being its accused perpetrator.\u201d \u201cThe baby-faced vigilante has become a hero to many among the far right-wing political establishment, who have hailed him as a paragon of virtue brave enough to stand up to the sinister forces of the Black Lives Matter movement.\u201d In Georgia, three men are on trial, charged with the killing of Ahmaud Arbery, a Black man who was running in their neighborhood. \u201cThese three White men have pleaded not guilty (the defense contends Travis McMichael shot Arbery in self-defense) and claim to have tried to make a citizen\u2019s arrest of Arbery as he was out jogging.\u201d \u201cOn Tuesday, a detective testified that Gregory McMichael told him he never saw Arbery commit a crime \u2013 even though a reasonable suspicion of one is a necessary component for a citizen\u2019s arrest to be lawful.\u201d The bottom line? \u201cWe live in a society where a Black man can be allegedly killed for jogging in the \u2018wrong\u2019 part of Georgia and the White men charged in his murder face a nearly all-White jury, while a White teen armed for war can be hailed by many as a hero.\u201d As John Thune, the South Dakota Republican who is his party\u2019s whip in the Senate, noted, \u201cthe algorithms that power social media and search engines shape what we see on these platforms.\u201d Thune and a bipartisan group of lawmakers in both houses of Congress have introduced legislation aimed at giving consumers more control over what Facebook and other platforms serve up. \u201cBy showing similar content based on what a user has already liked, watched, searched for or reacted to, the filter bubble contributes to political polarization and social isolation,\u201d Thune wrote. \u201cPerhaps the most important thing to understand is that users don\u2019t make a conscious decision to enter the filter bubble.\u201d The bill \u201cwould make large tech companies, including Facebook, Google, Instagram, TikTok, YouTube, and others, notify users if the platform is using AI to prioritize content. If the user doesn\u2019t want to have an opaque algorithm manipulate his or her online experience, he or she can easily opt out.\u201d For more on technology: Jeff Yang: The future of digital art doesn\u2019t have to be paved with troll memes and trash Aaron Rodgers is a football superstar, as Dean Obeidallah wrote, but the Green Bay Packers quarterback is a disappointment in other ways. \u201cRodgers has not only shown an amazing level of talent but also true leadership,\u201d Obeidallah observed. \u201cIn jaw-dropping contrast, Rodgers\u2019 response following the news last week that he was unvaccinated and contracted Covid-19 has been the opposite of a strong leader. While appearing on SiriusXM\u2019s \u2018The Pat McAfee Show\u2019 on Friday, he lashed out at critics as a \u2018woke mob,\u2019 spewed medically unsound concerns on Covid-19 vaccines and failed to apologize for seemingly misleading people in August that he had been vaccinated.\u201d \u201cRodgers should apologize for his misleading comments suggesting he was vaccinated, and going forward should only share accurate information about Covid-19 and treatment based on science \u2013 not the suggestions of comedians.

And you know, at the top you have Trumpy troll and he occupies most of the bandwidth so if you\u2019re going to get any attention and you want to raise funds you\u2019ve got to do outrageous things\u2026and eventually one grabs.\u201d Posting the video, Jill Filipovic wrote, was \u201cwildly inappropriate. If just about any other person in the US tweeted out a bizarro fantasy cartoon of them attacking and killing a coworker, they would definitely have a big HR problem on their hands, likely face termination from their jobs and possibly be getting a visit from the cops.\u201d \u201cThe Republican Party has a serious problem with extremism. Instead of cleaning house, they\u2019re doubling down in defense \u2013 finger-pointing at Democrats, refusing to take any responsibility for their actions, and frothing up the most dangerous fringes of their base.\u201d",

View more opinion on CNN. Stripped of the executive power that once let him evade accountability, former president Donald Trump appears to be losing his fight to keep his secrets from the American people. It\u2019s a remarkable development for a man long recognized for his powerful use of secrecy \u2013 and for those who have yearned for the truth and feared they\u2019d never get it. On Monday, Trump asked a federal judge to block the handover of records relating to his presidency and the January 6 insurrection to the House select committee investigating the insurrection. As she denied Trump\u2019s request, Judge Tanya Chutkan wrote, \u201cPresidents are not kings, and Plaintiff is not President.\u201d With these nine words she addressed the heart of the matter and pushed the former reality TV star closer to a collision with the truth. (Trump has indicated that he will appeal the ruling.) Trump's ridiculous falsehood-filled letter to the Wall Street Journal From the time that the American people denied him re-election, Trump has reached for extreme measures in an effort to destroy the well-documented and objective truth of his election defeat and replace it with a fantasy of profound corruption at the polls. He acted as if he would be restored to power, through one bizarre process or another, once enough people believed in the fantasy he was selling. Throughout his life, Trump has gained power, especially the kind that comes with celebrity, by controlling what others know. In business, he did this by producing a blizzard of claims about his fortune but keeping the verifiable data private. As a politician, he simply refused to release his taxes, as others have done for decades, which meant he alone was the source of information about his businesses.  Finally, as president, he offered the American people claims about his wealth that were divorced from reality. Although records appear to show he made $1.6 billion in outside earnings while in the White House, he publicly said that the presidency had cost him billions. It seems likely he made this claim to play up the notion that he had selflessly sacrificed in order to serve. It\u2019s Trump\u2019s stonewalling (among other things) that Judge Chutkan seems to reference as she declares, \u201cPresidents are not kings.\u201d Of course, she is right. Our government is set up with three branches to allow for checks and balances, and to prevent an all-powerful authoritarian from taking control. This scheme was fashioned by those who abhorred monarchy and sought to build a resilient democracy. Trump was, it seems, the president least interested in democracy and most envious of the world\u2019s dictators and strongmen, who are not burdened by oversight. When Judge Chutkan then noted that Trump, \u201cis not President,\u201d she struck a blow to whatever it is that energizes his fantasies that he is rightfully owed the seat in the Oval Office. In Trump\u2019s heart, there beats a force that refuses to accept certain unhappy realities and then mobilizes him to create an alternative. It is this part of Trump that led him to rally his supporters behind an unproven idea that he was cheated in the election. This led to the bloody January 6 attack on the Capitol by those who believed they could overturn the results. That day of violence means Americans can no longer assume our political system is reliably peaceful. The documents that Trump sought to hide includes communication logs, video records, handwritten notes and more. This kind of evidence, developed outside Trump\u2019s story-making whirlwind, represents a calling to account of the sort the former President has avoided (despite two impeachments) and that many of his opponents feared would never come. The racist theory that is animating some Trump backers It\u2019s safe to say that for years the Trump\u2019s opponents, critics and victims have stood in frustration as he evaded accountability. To those shell-shocked citizens who fear Trump will get away again, like a squid disappearing in a cloud of ink, I\u2019d say that this time is different. Just as Trump no longer possesses the executive privilege that the office can cite to withhold documents, he no longer has the power to pardon allies who practice criminal deceptions on his behalf. He also can\u2019t give people cushy or prestigious jobs, hang medals on their necks, or treat them to rides on Air Force One. Diminished in his power, Trump will join the rest of us who will watch to see how his former aides and key supporters respond to subpoenas issued by the select committee to investigate the January 6 Capitol attack. Former national security adviser and Trump-pardon recipient Michael Flynn, 2020 Trump campaign chairman William Stepien and former campaign adviser Jason Miller are among those who have already received subpoenas. Last week the committee chair Rep Bennie Thompson, said he had signed about 20 new subpoenas that would be out \u201csoon.\u201d  The steady, somewhat normal pace of the committee\u2019s work has attached a feeling of inevitability to its efforts. Trump, who has always seemed to wriggle away from the usual checks that keep others on the straight-and-narrow, appears to have limited options. He cannot promise, or even signal a promise of a pardon for those who face criminal conviction for refusing a subpoena or even lying to authorities. He no longer has that power. Similarly, Trump would be challenged to provide the lawyers, financial assistance or moral support required to help people maintain their refusals. In years past, when his key allies were in the government or worked for Trump\u2019s businesses, he had much to offer. Today he has less. Altogether, the picture suggests that the realities of government are catching up to one of the most creative escape artists ever seen in American politics. The truth is out there. It\u2019s coming soon.",

She is a weekly opinion contributor to CNN, a contributing columnist to The Washington Post and a columnist for World Politics Review. The views expressed in this commentary are her own. View more opinion on CNN. Republican Rep. Liz Cheney made an intriguing observation Tuesday about the legal arguments made by Donald Trump\u2019s team. During a meeting of the committee investigating the January 6 attack on the Capitol, she implicitly reminded us of the most important aspect of the panel\u2019s work, the part that must remain at the forefront of its efforts, and a key guide in the timing of its investigation. Above all, the committee must try to determine precisely what role Trump played in the events of January 6, a violent assault on Congress on the day when it was certifying the 2020 election results. To many of us, it was a key moment in an unprecedented coup d\u2019\u00e9tat attempt against the United States. The committee met Tuesday night to discuss what to do about Steve Bannon \u2013 a Trump ally \u2013 and his refusal to testify despite a subpoena from the panel where Cheney serves as vice chair. (The committee approved a measure that seeks to hold Bannon in contempt of Congress.) Here\u2019s Cheney\u2019s interesting point: Bannon and Trump are fighting the committee\u2019s efforts to obtain documents and testimony by claiming executive privilege, the right of a president to maintain confidentiality despite Congress\u2019 duty of oversight. That right has been used by previous presidents to shield themselves from accountability. Bannon\u2019s claim is absurd. He did not even work in the government. But, in Cheney\u2019s analysis, the executive privilege claim by Bannon and Trump, \u201cappear to reveal one thing: They suggest that President Trump was personally involved in the planning and execution of January 6th.\u201d Cheney\u2019s piercing words \u2013 and she had some more for her Republican colleagues \u2013 are a reminder that it\u2019s crucial to find out what exactly Trump\u2019s role was during the events of that day. And Bannon very likely knows a lot about that. Facebook, don't change your name -- change your CEO That Trump has tried to overturn the result of a legal, valid election is beyond question. We\u2019ve all heard him repeat ad nauseam the Big Lie, the claim that he won. We\u2019ve heard the tapes where he pressures election officials in Georgia to contrive a victory where he lost, \u201cAll I want to do is this. I just want to find 11,780 votes, which is one more than we have.\u201d We\u2019ve even seen a copy of the memo by one of his lawyers, in which he lays out a six-step plan for stealing the election by having Vice President Mike Pence throw out the results in seven states, claiming there were \u201ccompeting electors,\u201d when there was no such thing. Pence didn\u2019t do it, and Trump\u2019s supporters erected a noose and gallows and shouted calls for Pence to be hanged as they rampaged through the Capitol on January 6, causing members of Congress to run for their lives and delay the certification until later that night. That is all extraordinarily damning, but if Trump was actually involved in organizing an assault on the Capitol, if a sitting president coordinated an insurrection against the country, that\u2019s an even greater crime. Trump had summoned supporters to Washington \u2013 Big protests in DC on January 6th, he tweeted in December, \u201c\u2026will be wild.\u201d At the rally that day, he sent their emotions to a boil with a fiery speech \u2013 \u201cfight like hell\u201d he told them \u2013  and then encouraged them to head to the Capitol. As for Bannon\u2019s involvement, the committee chair, Democratic Rep. Bennie Thompson, said he believed he had significant knowledge of the attack. Cheney said the committee\u2019s investigation has found he had \u201csubstantial advanced knowledge of the plans for January 6th, and likely had an important role in formulating those plans.\u201d On January 5, he announced on his podcast, \u201cAll hell is going to break loose tomorrow,\u201d explaining cryptically that it would be, \u201cextraordinarily different than what most Americans expect.\u201d Two people could save US democracy But what about Trump? What did he know? In their book \u201cPeril,\u201d journalists Bob Woodward and Robert Costa reported that Bannon, who had once been Trump\u2019s leading strategist, spoke with Trump ahead of January 6 and told him he should be in Washington that day. He told the then-president, \u201cWe are going to kill it in the crib. Kill the Biden presidency in the crib.\u201d According to the authors, Bannon told Trump, \u201cWe\u2019re going to bury Biden\u2026f\u2014ing bury him.\u201d Trump told his supporters he\u2019d march with them to the Capitol, and then headed to the White House, to watch it all unfold on television. He saw the images of mayhem, his supporters clashing violently with police, smashing windows, breaking down doors; members of Congress cowering in fear as the mob shouted \u201cFight for Trump!\u201d and \u201cHang Mike Pence.\u201d According to \u201cPeril,\u201d Trump\u2019s daughter Ivanka, who served as a presidential adviser, and others urged him to call off his loyalists, but he refused. Retired Gen. Keith Kellogg told him, \u201cthis is out of control\u2026once a mob starts turning like that, you\u2019ve lost it,\u201d advising, \u201cYou really should do a tweet.\u201d Trump reportedly blinked and went back to watching television. Eventually, hours after the insurgents had broken through the barricades and stormed the Capitol, Trump relented, posting a video where he told his supporters he understood their pain, again lying about the election being stolen, adding, \u201cGo home, we love you, you\u2019re very special.\u201d There\u2019s much the select congressional committee on January 6 needs to establish. But as Cheney\u2019s comment reminds us, nothing is more important than the precise actions of the then-commander-in-chief.  Knowing what part Trump played is crucial for dispensing justice and establishing the historical record, but even more than that \u2013 because this chapter is still not relegated to the pages of history. Trump is still denying that he was the loser in the 2020 election, and he seems prepared to run again for president, and potentially claim he won no matter what American voters decide. The January 6 commission needs to step up the pace and sharpen its focus. Time is of the essence.",

The views in this commentary belong to the author. View more opinion at CNN. The House select committee investigating the January 6 riot appears to be moving swiftly to hold former President Donald Trump\u2019s cronies to account. First up is former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon, who could face charges of criminal contempt for refusing to comply with the committee\u2019s subpoena. Despite some Beltway carping, the committee\u2019s move to pursue criminal charges is essential for its search for the truth of what happened on Jan. 6. Bannon was among the very first to be subpoenaed by the committee, with good reason. While he fell out with Trump and left the White House in August 2017, the two later reconciled. According to Bob Woodward and Robert Costa\u2019s book \u201cPeril,\u201d Bannon convinced the former president, who was at his Mar-a-Lago resort in late December, to return to Washington, DC for Jan. 6. According to the book, Bannon acknowledged the date \u201cwas the moment for a reckoning\u201d and told Trump, \u201cWe are going to kill it in the crib. Kill the Biden presidency in the crib.\u201d On January 5, Bannon said the quiet part out loud on his podcast: \u201cAll hell is going to break loose tomorrow.\u201d (He later claimed he was alluding to Vice President Mike Pence rejecting electoral slates). Thursday, Bannon failed to show up for a scheduled deposition before the House committee. His lawyer said his client would not provide documents or testify until the committee reached an agreement with Trump over executive privilege or a court weighed in on the matter. The Jan. 6 committee has seen and raised him, announcing it will adopt a report to hold him in criminal contempt. The report will then move to the House for a vote. If it is approved (as it almost surely will, unless Bannon relents), it will go to US Attorney General Merrick Garland and the Justice Department to decide whether to prosecute. Some legal experts have questioned the move to pursue criminal charges, citing the possibility prosecution could take years and ultimately lead to Bannon\u2019s acquittal. Europe's energy crunch is giving Putin the upper hand They are wrong. If the committee turns the other cheek, it would preemptively surrender its own investigative powers. Letting Bannon go would invite others to act with the same impunity. The committee has issued a total of 19 subpoenas and more could be on the way  If the committee gives Bannon a pass, will the others comply? One might as well turn the committee lights off. Conversely, pursuing charges against Bannon sends a message to other witnesses; they could be in serious trouble if they refuse to cooperate. It is not enough for the committee that there is already damaging information against Bannon publicly available. There is no substitute for the compulsion of an oath or the power of cross-examination to elicit the whole truth. Such evidence could be used by others, like prosecutors in Georgia, who are relying on the committee\u2019s investigation as they determine if Trump broke laws trying to overturn the state\u2019s election results. As a practitioner of Congressional oversight and a former prosecutor, we believe prosecution is likely. For starters, Bannon\u2019s legal claim is unfounded. His lawyer\u2019s letter cites the same legal fight that ultimately shot down the House\u2019s attempt to get former White House counsel Don McGahn to comply with a subpoena, which asserts \u201cthe President\u201d can make executive privilege determinations. But Trump is no longer the president. In the United States, we still only have one of those at a time, and President Joe Biden has not asserted privilege here. On the contrary, the Biden administration has cooperated with Congress, waiving privilege so far when it comes to witnesses and documents alike. In February, Trump\u2019s lawyers claimed he could not be impeached as a former president. Now, nine months after his departure, Trump is indicating he will assert the prerogatives of the White House by trying to invoke executive privilege to block the House committee from getting information from certain witnesses. Even if Trump could claim the privilege, it is hard to understand how it could apply to Bannon. The House committee is investigating events on and around January 6, 2021, and Trump fired Bannon in 2017. Even if Bannon had been a current executive employee, allegedly helping incite an insurrection, it would not be considered an official function of his job. When Rep. Mo Brooks asked the Justice Department to defend him after Rep. Eric Swalwell sued him for his alleged role in the insurrection, the DOJ rejected the request, saying he was not entitled to immunity as a federal employee because his actions did not fall under the scope of his job. The Washington failure that's making us sick Bannon\u2019s legal defense is also weaker, because unlike others, he has not cooperated or negotiated with the committee. Courts do not like that. We believe Garland will very likely prosecute; this is a man who knows a strong case when he sees one. As a former judge, Garland knows the administration of justice depends on complying with subpoenas, and enforcing the law when they are disregarded. And as a lawyer who has lived and breathed the Constitution for more than four decades, he is committed and sworn to uphold its authority. Article I grants Congress the implied power of oversight, which requires investigation. The investigation requires the ability to compel testimony under oath. What of the supposed delay critics say this move will occasion? The last time someone was indicted for criminal contempt of Congress, the House committee adopted a resolution in April 1983. The resolution was then agreed to in the House in May, and an indictment followed eight days later, with the jury delivering a verdict in July. Even if the Bannon case takes longer, no matter. The committee need not wait for court rulings to continue the investigation and issue a detailed all-but-final report while it awaits an outcome in the Bannon prosecution. Bannon seems to be relishing the fight. In the fever-swamped parallel universe in which he dwells, it is a badge of honor. But the drama serves more noble purposes as well, reminding the press and the public of Trump\u2019s illegitimate assault on the 2020 election, which allegedly led to the insurrection. Bannon\u2019s actions also keep an important question front and center: What does he have to hide?  Ours is a government of laws, not men. It was routine during the Trump years for the president and his minions to make a mockery of both the law and of Congress\u2019 constitutional authority. Let\u2019s not forget the House voted to hold then-Attorney General Bill Barr in criminal contempt for refusing to comply with subpoenas. (The Department of Justice, of course, did not prosecute him.) For the American experiment to endure, it is vital to restore full faith and trust in the law\u2019s compulsory power. Without it, there is no accountability for those who rule, and the prospect of our enduring liberty is in peril. The January 6 committee\u2019s resolute enforcement of its authority is about more than Steve Bannon. It reinforces the foundation of our constitutional republic.",

We\u2019re looking back at the strongest, smartest opinion takes of the week from CNN and other outlets. \u201cAll I ask is a tall ship and a star to steer her by,\u201d wrote John Masefield in his 1902 poem \u201cSea Fever.\u201d The lure of the \u201clonely sea and the sky\u201d is powerful: \u201cthe wheel\u2019s kick and the wind\u2019s song and the white sail\u2019s shaking\u2026the call of the running tide is a wild call and a clear call that may not be denied.\u201d Facebook chief Mark Zuckerberg couldn\u2019t deny it. Last weekend he posted a 38-second video on Instagram, the platform his company owns, of him sailing with his wife and friends, scudding briskly along, a hilly coast in the distance. The post came as his company faced its biggest crisis. On Tuesday, former Facebook employee Frances Haugen \u201ctestified before Congress that Facebook is indeed damaging girls\u2019 body image, dividing the nation, and allowing extremism to thrive \u2013 and worse, that the company knows it, and chooses to largely ignore the problem to protect its profits,\u201d Jill Filipovic wrote. \u201cFacebook\u2019s algorithm, Haugen said, organizes content based on engagement, which can lead to the most inflammatory and shocking posts getting preferential treatment and moving their way to the top of any given person\u2019s feed. Essentially, the company makes decisions about what it wants you to see, and it keeps those decisions secret from the public, according to Haugen; changing the algorithm, she said, might impact the company\u2019s earnings.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s been quite a week,\u201d Zuckerberg observed in a Facebook post Tuesday. On Sunday, \u201c60 Minutes\u201d had broadcast a revealing interview with Haugen. On Monday, Facebook and Instagram had suffered an outage of about six hours. But it was his Tuesday post that responded to Haugen\u2019s allegations. \u201cThe argument that we deliberately push content that makes people angry for profit is deeply illogical,\u201d he wrote. \u201cWe make money from ads, and advertisers consistently tell us they don\u2019t want their ads next to harmful or angry content.\u201d Donie O\u2019Sullivan wrote that Zuckerberg\u2019s defense doesn\u2019t hold up: \u201cUnfortunately for Facebook, Haugen is on to something.\u201d Financially, Facebook\u2019s strategy is working \u2013 the company is worth nearly a trillion dollars on the stock market. Morally, the company is adrift, Haugen and other critics maintained. \u201cThese revelations should be a wake-up call,\u201d wrote Kara Alaimo. \u201cIf we\u2019re not going to abandon these platforms en masse \u2013 which, let\u2019s face it, is not likely to happen \u2013 it\u2019s time to devise ways to protect ourselves and our loved ones\u2026 to start relying on other information sources for joy and edification \u2013 like parks, hobbies, friends and legitimate news sources. It\u2019s probably also the only way to get the company to take the threats it poses to users seriously and try harder to fix them.\u201d Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell seemed uncharacteristically adrift, too, last week. After insisting that it was up to the Democrats to stave off a disastrous default on America\u2019s national debt, McConnell suddenly offered GOP support for a two-month increase in the borrowing limit. It was a crisis averted, and many sighed in relief, for the moment. But McConnell took heat from former President Donald Trump and some Trump-supporting senators. \u201cSenators Tom Tillis and Josh Hawley, among others, made clear Wednesday that this is all about blaming the Democrats, not about paying our bills,\u201d wrote Joe Lockhart. \u201cAnother potential credit downgrade, a stock market plunge or a worldwide financial crisis are all worth it if it inflicts political damage on President Joe Biden and the Democrats.\u201d Former Treasury Secretary Jacob J. Lew wrote for the CNN Business Perspectives section that delaying the \u201cfiscal cliff\u201d to December \u201cis no way to manage a great nation. Congress must act quickly to significantly extend or raise the debt ceiling for the long term, so that our nation does not lurch from crisis to crisis. That is the only way for the United States to avoid a catastrophic self-inflicted disaster.\u201d The GOP\u2019s outrage at the soaring national debt conveniently resurfaced in Congress after a Democrat won the White House. Under Trump, the debt grew by $7 trillion while Republicans stayed mostly silent. The more urgent matter, SE Cupp observed, is that \u201cBiden is, well, floundering, and ceding the most important issue to the GOP. That issue isn\u2019t infrastructure, it isn\u2019t the debt ceiling\u2026The most important issue is neutralizing Donald Trump. The future of our democratic republic hangs in the balance and is quite literally determined by how much power Trump is allowed to grab again.\u201d A \u201cblockbuster report\u201d by the Senate Judiciary Committee, Jennifer Rodgers noted, \u201cadded significant details to what was previously known about how Trump tried to subvert DOJ authority by attempting to turn what is meant to be an independent law enforcement agency into a co-conspirator\u201d in the then-President\u2019s bid to overturn the 2020 election results. Four Trump loyalists are resisting subpoenas from the House select committee investigating the January 6 insurrection at the Capitol. As Norman Eisen and Hank Sparks wrote, they may be trying to run out the clock in hopes that Republicans will win control of Congress next year and shut down the investigation.  \u201cCongress and the public must do everything in their power to support the courts\u2019 moving quickly,\u201d Eisen and Sparks argued. \u201cIt is the duty of these judges to our Constitution, laws and democracy itself to allow us to get to the truth of January 6 and to brush aside specious executive privilege claims.\u201d As Michael D\u2019Antonio wrote, the mob \u201cattacked the US Capitol with shouts of \u2018Hang Mike Pence\u2019\u2026 But now, eight months later, Pence is indignant about how much coverage media is giving the people who came for him at the Capitol and suggested that the goal of the coverage is to tarnish the reputations of the millions of people supporting Trump.\u201d The former vice president\u2019s political ambitions rest in the hands of a party where the loyalty test for many is allegiance to Donald Trump. \u201cPence is behaving like the middle school kid intimidated by a bully\u2019s lunch money protection racket. Fearful of fighting back, he instead brings a little extra money for the gang every day and says the head bully is really his good buddy.\u201d For more: Andrew Yang: How to get our democracy working again Jeffrey Toobin: It\u2019s McConnell\u2019s Supreme Court In the Washington Post, Eugene Robinson gave voice to some troubling questions: \u201cWhy is the news dominated by ridiculous controversies that should not be controversial at all? When did so many of our fellow citizens become full-blown nihilists who deny even the concept of objective reality?\u201d He noted that Sen. Lindsey Graham was heckled in his home state of South Carolina for recommending that people get vaccinated. \u201cCovid-19 is a highly infectious disease that has killed more than 700,000 Americans,\u201d wrote Robinson. The \u201cvaccines all but guarantee that recipients will not die from Covid. I have, or had, an acquaintance who refused to get vaccinated, despite pleas from his adult children to protect himself. He got Covid-19, and it killed him. Most of the deaths the nation has suffered during the current delta-variant wave of the disease \u2014 deaths of the unvaccinated \u2014 have been similarly needless and senseless.\u201d On Thursday, Pfizer asked US regulators for emergency approval of its vaccine for children ages 5 to 11, potentially a major step forward in fighting the disease. Moira Szilagyi, a pediatrician for 41 years who\u2019s president-elect of the American Academy of Pediatrics, is looking forward to the day her grandchildren, ages 5 and 8, will be eligible for a Covid-19 vaccine. \u201cMore than 13 million adolescents aged 12 to 17 have already received the vaccine, and there is a lot of evidence it is safe and effective. Now, nonpartisan scientific advisory boards at the FDA and the CDC will review the data from the clinical trials in children aged 11 and younger. This review is an important step and will ensure the dosage is correct, effective and safe for the younger age group.\u201d \u201cI hope they determine the vaccine is ready. My family certainly is.\u201d Covid has killed more than 115,000 health and care workers around the world, according to a May estimate by the World Health Organization. \u201cVaccinating all health and care workers globally is both a moral and practical imperative,\u201d wrote Strive Masiyiwa and Tom Frieden. \u201cPrioritizing these workers makes all of us safer. Yet based on a WHO estimate of 140 nations in July, only one in eight health and care workers across the world had been vaccinated, with most of those who have been vaccinated working in high-income countries.\u201d Former UN Ambassador Nikki Haley blasted liberals in a speech Tuesday at the Ronald Reagan Presidential Library. \u201cShe said that the US was in the middle of \u2018a clash of civilizations\u2019 and slammed President Joe Biden\u2019s leadership, saying he \u2018thinks retreat is a sign of strength,\u2019\u201d Julian Zelizer noted. \u201cGoing further, the former diplomat flexed her deeply partisan muscle, saying that Democrats didn\u2019t believe in America anymore.\u201d The same politician who strongly criticized Trump after January 6 now says the former president is a friend and \u201cwe need him in the Republican Party. I don\u2019t want us to go back to the days before Trump.\u201d Zelizer wrote, \u201cHaley reflects the nature of the GOP in 2021. The radicalization of the party means that even those who are seen as moderate often fold in the face of Trump\u2019s tactics and take up his talking points. Haley\u2019s red-meat rhetoric at the Reagan library was utterly predictable and the speech was likely a preview of what Republicans candidates will sound like going into 2024. There\u2019s no going back.\u201d Nobel Prize week 2021 honored an array of leading scientists \u2013 and two journalists. The Peace Prize went to Maria Ressa, a former CNN reporter who founded Rappler in the Philippines and is \u201can icon in the drive to defend democracy against autocrats who manipulate public opinion, misuse the legal system against perceived enemies, unleash hordes of social media followers against their critics,\u201d wrote Frida Ghitis. Ressa shared the award with Russian journalist Dmitry Muratov, editor in chief of Novaya Gazeta. \u201cMuratov founded the paper with a group of journalists back in 1993, and they have managed to continue their vital investigative work even as Vladimir Putin\u2019s regime crushes other truth tellers,\u201d Ghitis observed. The physics prizes attracted the attention of Don Lincoln, who pointed out that the three laureates were honored \u201cfor developing methods to understand complicated physical systems. And winning this award reaffirms what should be accepted science: The phenomena driving climate change is well known. It\u2019s basic physics, albeit playing out in the ever-changing atmosphere. Big picture, the conversation should no longer be on debating the science itself, but rather on deciding what society should do about it.\u201d The second season of the popular Apple+ show \u201cTed Lasso\u201d ended this week with drama on the soccer pitch and a sign of bitter rivalry to come. Many have hailed the show for centering the narrative around the big heart of an American football coach who skillfully adapts to managing a UK team playing a different sport \u2014 what the rest of the world calls \u201cfootball.\u201d Two medieval historians sized up the show in a fresh way: \u201cAlthough the show\u2019s superficial focus over the first two seasons has been on Ted as a \u2018nice guy,\u2019\u201d wrote David M. Perry and Matthew Gabriele, \u201cthat\u2019s not really what the show is about.

According to the federal government, there have been at least 44 oil spills that have each released more than 10,000 barrels (420,000 gallons) of oil into US waters since 1969\u2026 it is long overdue for our federal leaders to permanently ban new offshore drilling in US waters.\u201d For more: Sean Anderson: A serious question about our weirded world Biden\u2019s job ratings have plunged in the past several months \u2013 CNN\u2019s average of six recent polls shows 45% approval, with 50% of Americans disapproving of the president\u2019s performance. \u201cDemocrats have completely misread Biden\u2019s 2020 election mandate,\u201d wrote former Rep.

The opinions expressed here are her own. Read more opinion at CNN. The more information that emerges about former President Donald Trump\u2019s efforts to remain in power despite losing the 2020 election, the more difficult it becomes for the Department of Justice to avoid investigating the wide array of potentially criminal conduct by the former President between the election and January 6. The Senate Judiciary Committee\u2019s recent blockbuster report added significant details to what was previously known about how Trump tried to subvert DOJ authority by attempting to turn what is meant to be an independent law enforcement agency into a co-conspirator. Some of the report\u2019s damning facts were already known, such as: following the election, Trump pressured then-Acting Attorney General Jeffrey Rosen to throw DOJ\u2019s weight behind baseless election fraud claims, in large part by using theories already rejected in the courts.  Previous reporting also revealed the former President\u2019s threats to replace Rosen with Jeffrey Clark, an underling supportive of Trump\u2019s election conspiracy theories \u2013 only backing off when numerous high-ranking officials said they would resign en masse in response. But what the Committee\u2019s report \u2013 with the benefit of additional documents and the testimony of Rosen and others \u2013 makes clear is Trump\u2019s actions and those of others, like Clark, were even more manipulative, persistent and pointed in pressing debunked fraud claims to justify their effort to overturn the election. This disturbing knowledge comes at a moment when the Committee\u2019s work is still underway, as they await documents and testimony from others, including former Trump allies who are trying their hardest to evade the Committee\u2019s subpoenas. Will 4 Trump aides defy riot probe subpoenas? Any criminal referrals the Committee may make to the DOJ will occur when the investigation is complete. Of course, DOJ doesn\u2019t need a referral to start investigating, and there is no benefit to waiting; cases only grow weaker over time and memories fade. Typically, a criminal investigation is also considered more serious than, and takes precedence over, a Congressional probe. So as the revelations pile up, the question many have asked for months comes to the fore again: will the DOJ investigate these events and possibly file charges against anyone? There is no lack of possible crimes to investigate here. Interfering with or attempting to interfere with a federal election is a crime, as is making false statements to federal officials or interfering with the operations of Congress. The standard for initiating a criminal investigation is a modest one, requiring only articulable facts reasonably indicating a crime has occurred; at this point, more than enough evidence of each of these crimes has been publicly revealed to justify a full federal investigation. Avlon: GOP is using the most pathetic kind of legalese Of course, it\u2019s possible an investigation is proceeding; usually, criminal investigations are not announced publicly. Law enforcement works out of the public gaze, in part to allow for the effective gathering of evidence that, in many cases, is subject to strict grand jury secrecy rules. In this instance, however, given the publicity surrounding the events in question and the ongoing Congressional investigation, a secret DOJ investigation being carried out at the present time appears unlikely. Make no mistake: prosecuting the former President would be a significant challenge for any prosecutor: the burden of proof in criminal cases is high; Trump has a knack for trying to make things happen without being explicit about what he is asking for, making proof of intent difficult; and the former President and his supporters would likely claim (wrongly) the prosecution is politically motivated. But none of these obstacles is a barrier to, at minimum, investigating egregious behavior. Some reluctance is understandable. Attorney General Merrick Garland and his colleagues have lots of work to do to restore the integrity of the Department after the abuses of the Trump years, and to advance their priorities in various important areas, like strengthening voting rights and investigating civil rights abuses by police. A scary portrait of life inside Trump's White House There are legitimate worries a case of this historic magnitude and complexity could overshadow everything else DOJ does, not to mention concerns about the unknown political ramifications of bringing such charges. The Biden White House also seems to have little appetite for criminal charges against Trump, although President Joe Biden himself has pledged in the past not to interfere with DOJ\u2019s criminal decision-making. So far, Garland has appeared to defer to other investigations instead of building his own case, assisting Congress\u2019s inquiry by providing DOJ documents and declining to assert executive privilege over communications involving the former President. Meanwhile, Trump\u2019s conduct in cajoling Georgia\u2019s election officials to \u201cfind\u201d him just enough extra votes to overtake Biden has prompted a Fulton County District Attorney\u2019s investigation, which could theoretically lead to charges for at least that part of Trump\u2019s machinations.  But the federal courts, ultimately, remain the best place to prosecute an overarching scheme \u2013 involving an attack on Congress \u2013 to undermine the results of a free and fair election across multiple states. As a nation, are we really willing to accept that a former President, who pledged to faithfully execute our laws but instead tried to fraudulently steal an election to stay in power, walks away without even a comprehensive federal criminal investigation of his conduct? The lack of transparent, unequivocal action by DOJ in defending our democracy from an attack of this magnitude lets us all down.",

He is a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution. Hank Sparks is a project assistant at the States United Democracy Center specializing in democratic accountability. The opinions expressed here are their own. View more opinion on CNN. Will the House select committee investigating the January 6 insurrection succeed in uncovering the truth about that awful day? The committee has issued subpoenas to several loyalists of the former President, and their deadlines for cooperating have arrived. Will they be able to block or delay Congressional oversight, the way Trump and his allies did for all four years of his presidency? We don\u2019t think so. With Trump out of office, we believe the committee will get the information it wants on the timetable it needs. Under the committee\u2019s first wave of four subpoenas, key Trump loyalists Dan Scavino, Steve Bannon, Mark Meadows and Kash Patel are due to produce documents on Thursday and their testimony is due no later than October 15. Meadows, the former White House chief of staff, was a witness to, and deeply involved in, Trump\u2019s machinations to attack the election results, including pushing the Department of Justice to investigate baseless conspiracy theories and fraud claims about the 2020 presidential election, according to documents obtained by CNN and reported on in June. A spokesperson for Meadows then said Trump\u2019s former chief of staff would not be commenting on the matter. Pro-Trump lawyer's memo begins with a lie, then descends into madness Deputy Chief of Staff Scavino was a constant presence around Trump and a mouthpiece on social media on and around January 6, according to the select committee\u2019s subpoena, citing Scavino\u2019s Twitter account, as well as accounts detailed in the recent Bob Woodward-Robert Costa book, \u201cPeril.\u201d Patel was Trump\u2019s hand-picked man at the Pentagon and in constant communication with the White House that day, the select committee subpoena said, citing documents provided to the committee by the Department of Defense. Patel has acknowledged he\u2019s received the committee\u2019s subpoena and said he would \u201ccontinue to tell the truth to the American people about the events of January 6th.\u201d And then there is Trump\u2019s outside and longtime adviser, Bannon, who seemed to predict that violence might occur and told Trump to \u201ckill this administration in the crib\u201d before January 6, according to accounts in the Woodward-Costa book. CNN reported that Bannon, speaking on his \u201cWar Room\u201d podcast last month, \u201cconfirmed that he had huddled with Trump to plot a way to fundamentally undermine the Biden presidency on January 6 and even sort of declare victory.\u201d It appears that the committee has been successful in its attempts to serve subpoenas to Bannon and Meadows. The second wave of 11 subpoenas to people responsible for organizing the Women for America First rally on the Ellipse on January 6 will come due. Though not household names, the 11 are critically important for untangling the events of that day and Trump\u2019s role in them. Those subpoenaed include the former Trump campaign aide Katrina Pierson, who, the subpoena says (based on news reports), helped organize the rally and met with Trump in the Oval Office just two days before the insurrection. The subpoena targets also include Caroline Wren, who received tens of thousands of dollars as a consultant for the Trump campaign and Republican National Committee\u2019s joint fundraising committee, according to the Center for Responsive Politics\u2019 OpenSecrets site. Her title at the rally? \u201cVIP adviser.\u201d Another integral event organizer subpoenaed is Megan Powers. She was on the rally paperwork as \u201cOperations Manager for Schedule and Guidance,\u201d according to the select committee subpoena. She was also the Trump campaign\u2019s director of operations and was compensated about $300,000, said OpenSecrets. This second wave of people subpoenaed must produce documents by October 13 and appear by late October or early November. This is an aggressive set of deadlines. Every two years there is a risk that the House will change hands. The committee knows it cannot waste any time as the window for accountability closes. Mitch McConnell blinked Good thing the committee moved fast, and is preparing for the possibility that some of Trump\u2019s allies will resist the subpoenas. CNN has reported that the committee has been unable to physically serve Scavino with the subpoena. The Trump allies are potentially eying the Congressional clock and contemplating running it out until January 2023 when a new Congress of unknown majority takes office. The four are Trump loyalists par excellence, and so it is entirely possible that they will resist. Given all of that, why do we think this committee will succeed where others failed? First, because, as painful as those drawn-out battles of the Trump years were, they established precedents that can now be acted upon. It took years, but in Trump v. Mazars, the Supreme Court reinforced that the House has the power to secure \u201cneeded information\u201d and clarified the legal context for obtaining presidential documents. In Committee on the Judiciary v. McGahn, the DC Circuit ruled that the House may subpoena witnesses to appear and give testimony. Because these two cases have already resolved many critical legal questions, any litigation could move much more quickly than those cases did. Second, any decisions about whether documents or testimony are protected by executive privilege are no longer the purview of Donald Trump. The most important precedent, Nixon v. Administrator of General Services, noted that \u201cthe privilege is not for the benefit of the President as an individual, but for the benefit of the Republic.\u201d Decisions on behalf of the republic are now made by the Biden administration. It has signaled where it stands by declining to assert executive privilege for former Trump Department of Justice officials Jeffrey Rosen and Richard Donoghue and permitting them to testify to Congress about Trump\u2019s assault on the 2020 election that invited the insurrection. The administration will very likely continue this course of conduct going forward. Third, this is not your father\u2019s Justice Department. It is likely to wield the most powerful tool to compel enforcement of subpoenas: criminal contempt, prosecuting noncompliance with the threat of jail time and hefty fines. Bill Barr would not prosecute subpoena scofflaws (and was himself held in contempt by the House for refusal to comply with a subpoena). As demonstrated already by DOJ\u2019s assent to Rosen and Donoghue\u2019s testifying, Merrick Garland is unlikely to follow Barr\u2019s example. Knowing that those penalties may loom may change the calculus for these four individuals, whatever Trump may say. Fourth, some in the House are reportedly musing about the use of another tool that is even more expedited: Congress\u2019s power of inherent contempt. It has been long established that Congress itself can sanction contemptuous witnesses, by, for example, levying crippling fines. While the power has not been used in over a century, it should be considered and might be deployed if the behavior of subpoena recipients is outrageous enough. Still, what if those under subpoena or Trump himself decide to test all of this by individually or collectively going to court to block the subpoenas? The courts have the ability to move quickly if this ends up there, and the committee, press and public should push for speed. In Watergate, it was mere months between the subpoena for the White House tapes and the tapes being made available.  Less than four months after Special Prosecutor Leon Jaworski sought a subpoena for White House tapes, the trial, appellate and Supreme Court had ruled and United States v. Nixon had been decided, ordering Nixon to comply. Congress and the public must do everything in their power to support the courts\u2019 moving quickly. It is the duty of these judges to our Constitution, laws and democracy itself to allow us to get to the truth of January 6 and to brush aside specious executive privilege claims. We not only need accountability, we need to learn from the insurrection to prevent and deter a recurrence. This means Congress giving no quarter if there is litigation and seeking none. For example, the usual practice of Trump and his coterie asking for extensions on many or every filing, motion or hearing should be rejected out of hand. What about the fact that there have been challenges in serving at least one of the initial recipients, Dan Scavino? Subpoena recipients can run but they cannot hide \u2013 they can\u2019t dodge service indefinitely. That was most recently proven in the case of Rep. Mo Brooks. He apparently tried to evade service in a January 6 civil case but was eventually served. The same will happen here. All of the foregoing matters not just for Trump\u2019s congressional reckoning, but also for his criminal one. Serious federal criminal violations are potentially implicated here for Trump. While there is no sign the Department of Justice is actually looking at him so far, depending on what the select committee unearths, the committee can make referrals to the Department of Justice to take action. More immediately, and more promising for accountability, congressional conversations have begun with Georgia prosecutors about information sharing. The Fulton County District Attorney is actively investigating state charges for Trump\u2019s attacks on democracy, and he has real exposure there. After the investigation began last spring, Trump\u2019s former aide Jason Miller said in a statement: \u201cThis is simply the Democrats\u2019 latest attempt to score political points by continuing their witch hunt against President Trump, and everybody sees through it.\u201d But the DA is pressing forward. Indeed, Trump deepened the risk he faces with his admissions during his recent return to Georgia. The DA\u2019s cooperation with Congress could produce indictments as soon as next year, not after the committee finishes its work, makes referrals and waits for this very cautious DOJ to investigate and decide. For all those reasons, we believe Congress will get what it wants when it wants it, and that could mean consequences, even criminal ones, for Trump. It\u2019s about time.",

He is a senior fellow at Brookings. The opinions expressed here are his own. View more opinion at CNN. Because the assault on the 2020 election by former President Donald Trump and his enablers was so sweeping, the US House Select Committee investigating the deadly January 6 Capitol riot must pursue evidence equally broadly. We learned in recent days that the committee intends to do so, including obtaining a staggering load of information about Trump and others\u2019 misconduct from several federal agencies, and digging into misinformation and efforts to overturn the election  on 15 social media platforms, such as Facebook and Twitter. Trump responded with a threat to fight the committee by invoking executive privilege, but as one who fought him over that issue in his first impeachment in 2020, I\u2019m optimistic that the committee will get the information it needs. The committee\u2019s far-reaching demands for information to the executive branch and to non-governmental entities alike represent a classic investigative technique. Whether it\u2019s a criminal, civil, or congressional matter, you must get all the records, study the patterns, and see what emerges. The very first thing we did when we kicked off the investigation in the initial impeachment of Trump was issue more than 80 demands for information to entities and individuals \u2013 and the facts of Trump\u2019s assault on the 2020 election and its certification are even more far-flung. For instance, Trump\u2019s alleged obstruction of the Mueller investigation principally centered on a handful of aides at the White House and Department of Justice, whereas his alleged election wrongdoing encompassed multiple federal agencies and even reached into the states. The executive privilege stonewalling that Trump could order while in office won\u2019t work anymore. The congressional requests have been made to agencies led by officials appointed by President Joe Biden. They and the career professionals who will process the asks can be expected to comply. The Biden administration has already staked out the general position that executive privilege does not apply. The administration has waived executive privilege and allowed former Trump administration officials to provide testimony to Congress about the ex-president\u2019s attacks on the 2020 election and its certification. The US Department of Justice correctly reasoned that the \u201cextraordinary events in this matter constitute exceptional circumstances \u2026 [and] the congressional need for information outweighs the Executive Branch\u2019s interest in maintaining confidentiality.\u201d Oral testimony is typically the most sensitive when it comes to privilege, more so than documents. That\u2019s not to say that the current administration will completely waive the privilege for every one of the documents in the sweeping requests, but it\u2019s a clue that Biden will turn over a lot. The usual caution of administrations of both parties when it comes to executive privilege is less likely to prevail here. The events were so extraordinary and exceptional that there is less than usual risk of a precedent being created that can come back and be used against this or future administrations. Biden clearly is not likely to falsify an unquestioned election outcome or incite insurrection against his own government. MLK and LBJ's children: Our fathers' vision for voting rights is under attack again There could of course still be litigation by Trump to challenge the committee\u2019s authority to seek information. It is true that his lawyers did not attempt to stop his former officials\u2019 testimony, although the lawyers did claim that the former president was not waiving executive privilege. But just because Trump has not gone to court yet does not mean he will not do so. Trump has not exactly been shy about going to court, and his remarks over executive privilege when news of the latest document requests broke certainly open the door. If he does sue, he will be sailing into headwinds. The courts ultimately vindicated Congress\u2019s requests for information in two of the landmark cases connected to his first impeachment. They largely spurned Trump\u2019s objections in his case against his accounting firm Mazars that he lost in the Supreme Court and in the case involving former White House counsel Don McGahn, which Trump lost in the DC Circuit. Now those precedents secured as part of impeachment are there to speed things along. The prior impeachments have made other contributions to accelerating matters here. The second one earlier this year established an advanced factual scaffolding on which the committee is building by documenting in detail the events of January 6 and the long pattern of incitement by Trump that preceded it. That impeachment also moved on an extremely accelerated timetable that the committee is emulating here and would be well advised to maintain in court should they end up there \u2013 asking that lower court proceedings and appeals be handled on an emergency basis. If Trump tests the committee in court, he will find that the law of executive privilege is not in his favor. The general rule is that the privilege belongs to the nation, not to any former incumbent \u2013 and the Biden administration has already demonstrated its inclination to waive. It\u2019s true that the courts have counseled that a former president be consulted, and that no case has squarely decided what happens if the current president disagrees with the former president. So, Trump could go to court and seek an injunction, arguing that he\u2019s the owner of the privilege. But the tenor of the law makes it likely that he would lose \u2013  which may be why Trump did not attempt to stop those former officials from testifying in the first place. As the leading case in this area, Nixon v. Administrator of General Services, noted, \u201cthe privilege is not for the benefit of the President as an individual, but for the benefit of the Republic.\u201d The person who makes that decision should logically be the one who currently represents us all: the current president.  Together with the demands we learned about earlier this week for phone and other records from telecom and social media companies, all of that makes it likely that the truth will be uncovered. Private companies are not going to fool around either. A common investigative adage is \u201cfollow the money.\u201d Here, Congress should follow Trump\u2019s lies, especially the big lie that the election was stolen. The 1/6 committee is off to a good start doing just that, and there is ultimately little that Trump will be able to do to stop it.",

In a scene that participants have described as resembling the reality show \u201cThe Apprentice,\u201d then-President Trump spent hours at the White House on January 3 considering competing pitches from two top Justice Department officials about which of them should get the top spot as acting attorney general. Jeffrey Clark, then the attorney general for the civil division \u2013 who reportedly had secretly expressed his support for the bogus \u201cstolen election\u201d theory directly to Trump himself \u2013 made this straightforward proposition, in essence: Choose me and I\u2019ll deploy the Department to help you steal this election. Jeffrey Rosen, then the incumbent acting attorney general, made this counter-proposal to Trump: Replace me with Clark and I\u2019ll quit, along with several other DOJ leaders, and you\u2019ll have a mass resignation on your hands. Ultimately, after hours of deliberation, Trump stuck with Rosen. But if Trump had chosen Clark, it\u2019s not difficult to see what likely would have followed. That is because we now know that Clark had earlier drafted an absolutely bonkers letter he intended to be sent from the Justice Department to state officials in Georgia. The Justice Department, according to Clark\u2019s letter, had \u201cidentified significant concerns that may have impacted the outcome of the election in multiple States, including the State of Georgia.\u201d To be clear: Clark based these drastic claims on, essentially, nothing \u2013 though he reportedly did explain to Rosen that he had been \u201creading on the internet,\u201d according to the New York Times. Ron DeSantis is a big problem for Biden Clark\u2019s draft letter continued, \u201cthe Governor of Georgia should immediately call a special session to consider this important and urgent matter.\u201d The letter concludes that \u201cwe share with you our view that the Georgia General Assembly has implied authority under the Constitution of the United States to call itself into special session for [t]he limited purpose of considering issues pertaining to the appointment of Presidential Electors.\u201d Clark sought a sign-off on the draft by both Rosen and acting deputy attorney general Richard Donoghue. But they unequivocally rejected Clark\u2019s letter. But had it been sent, it would have put the Justice Department\u2019s stamp of approval on any efforts by Georgia officials to discard their state\u2019s actual vote, and instead award their electors to Trump. We don\u2019t know whether Georgia officials would have complied \u2013 some Georgia Republicans, like Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, resisted Trump\u2019s worst impulses when he tried to interfere with the election \u2013 but a letter from the Justice Department certainly would have opened the door to any Republican lawmaker willing to throw the election over to Trump. And it could have gotten even worse. There\u2019s a chilling two-word hint in Clark\u2019s letter: \u201cmultiple states.\u201d If Georgia had gone along with this scheme to subvert its citizens\u2019 votes and award its electors to Trump, then other Republican-controlled states would have had a blueprint, and an imprimatur, to do the same. It only would have taken two more states \u2013 say, Arizona and Wisconsin \u2013 to swing the entire 2020 election to Trump. The new attorney general, Merrick Garland, now has some serious work to do. First, he must firmly re-establish the Justice Department\u2019s independence \u2013 from the White House and from politics in general. On that front, Garland recently issued an important policy memorandum that strictly limits communications between DOJ and White House staffers. Garland also must ensure that the DOJ cooperates fully with ongoing congressional investigations. (We\u2019ve learned much of what we now know about the coup attempt because of ongoing congressional inquiries, which have now been consolidated under the House Select Committee on January 6). To that end, Garland also has been decisive. He has determined that the DOJ will not invoke executive privilege relating to congressional testimony by its officials. That decision will clear the way for Clark, Rosen and others to testify as Congress pursues the full truth. Finally, Garland has an obligation to meaningfully investigate and consider potential criminal charges relating to the coup attempt. Reasonable minds can differ on whether charges would ultimately stick, but there\u2019s more than enough \u201cpredication,\u201d as prosecutors call it \u2013 factual foundation \u2013 that demands that Garland\u2019s Justice Department at least take a serious look.  For example, the coup attempt could meet the legal definition of federal crimes, including depriving a state of a fair and impartial election, election interference by federal administrative officials, coercion of political activity and conspiracy to defraud the United States. Don\u2019t let anyone minimize what Trump, Clark and others nearly pulled off. We now know for sure that they were perilously close to turning the Justice Department into a weapon to assist in an attempted coup.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: In this weekly column \u201cCross Exam,\u201d Elie Honig, a CNN senior legal analyst and former federal and state prosecutor, gives his take on the latest legal news. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion on CNN. Watch Honig answer readers\u2019 questions on \u201cCNN Newsroom with Jim Acosta\u201d on weekends. Judge Amy Berman Jackson saw right through the dishonest attempts of former Attorney General William Barr to paper over his inexcusable distortion of the Mueller report. The federal judge pulled no punches in her ruling this month ordering the release of a redacted Justice Department memo recommending that former President Donald Trump should not be charged with obstruction of justice in the special counsel\u2019s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 election. The decision of the new attorney general, Merrick Garland, to appeal portions of Judge Jackson\u2019s ruling is a mistake, and marks a missed opportunity to break cleanly from the fundamental dishonesty that defined Barr\u2019s term in office. The dispute before Jackson concerns an internal DOJ memo relating to Barr\u2019s deceitful effort to save Trump from the consequences of Robert Mueller\u2019s devastating findings. Just two days after he received Mueller\u2019s 448-page report, Barr wrote a four-page summary letter that wildly mischaracterized the report. In the letter \u2013 which stated that Mueller\u2019s investigation did not establish conspiracy between the Trump campaign and Russia \u2013 Barr declared Trump free and clear on obstruction of justice, even though Mueller documented more than 100 contacts between Trump allies and Russia and meticulously cited evidence of obstruction, element-by-element (though Mueller did not reach a conclusion on whether Trump committed any crime, largely because of a Justice Department policy against indicting a sitting president). Jackson, in an ongoing lawsuit by a government transparency group seeking documents relating to the Mueller report, ruled that Barr\u2019s summary of Mueller\u2019s report was \u201cdisingenuous\u201d and that the Justice Department\u2019s representation of an internal legal memo that Barr purportedly consulted in drawing his no-obstruction conclusion offered \u201cincomplete explanations\u201d intended to \u201cobfuscate the true purpose of the memorandum.\u201d The man who could determine Trump's fate Jackson is hardly alone in her conclusion that Barr and his Justice Department fudged the truth (and perhaps worse) to protect Trump. Mueller himself wrote a letter in which he pointedly noted that Barr\u2019s public summary \u201cdid not fully capture the context, nature, and substance of this Office\u2019s work and conclusions.\u201d  And Judge Reggie Walton \u2013 nominated to the federal bench by Republican President George W. Bush in 2001 \u2013 also lambasted Barr for his dishonesty.  In a March 2020 ruling, in a lawsuit brought by a public interest group seeking access to redacted portions of the Mueller report, Walton called out Barr\u2019s \u201clack of candor,\u201d which \u201ccall(s) into question Attorney General Barr\u2019s credibility and in turn, the Department\u2019s representation\u201d on the Mueller report. In newly unredacted portions of her decision, Jackson went even farther. She pointedly ruled that Barr spearheaded an effort to get \u201ca jump on public relations\u201d intended to clear Trump notwithstanding the damning findings in the Mueller report, and that DOJ\u2019s true focus was on \u201chow to neutralize the impact of the Report in the court of public opinion.\u201d Jackson hit the nail on the head here.  Indeed, even though it took Barr all of two days to reach his \u201cno obstruction\u201d conclusion, he then withheld the Mueller report itself from the public for nearly a month, purportedly while doing redactions (which, Judge Walton later found, were improperly done). Meanwhile, public opinion calcified around his distorted, pro-Trump conclusions; Trump and his supporters spent that crucial time falsely crowing that Mueller had found \u201cno collusion, no obstruction.\u201d  To this day, Trump has faced no meaningful consequence for his obstructive actions.  He was never impeached for his conduct detailed in the Mueller report, nor has he been criminally charged. Garland landed in a difficult position.  Every new attorney general inherits messes from the prior administration, and this is an ugly one. And DOJ as an institution tends to be protective of its internal, deliberative processes.  But, by appealing, Garland is inherently going to bat for the prior administration, or at least failing to draw a clear line in the sand.  A decision by Garland not to appeal would have meant Americans could finally see an unredacted version of the memo reviewing Mueller\u2019s report. Perhaps more importantly, it would have sent a powerful message: that the new Justice Department intends to do things differently. Matt (Nevada):  If enough Americans end up refusing to take any of the Covid vaccines, and it ends up endangering our reaching herd immunity, is it possible for the government to make it mandatory? Yes.  The US Supreme Court ruled in 1905 that states can use their general \u201cpolice powers\u201d to enforce mandatory vaccination laws. This is not necessarily blanket permission for states to do as they please, however.  Any exercise of state power must be reasonable, and would depend on the nature of the disease, its spread, and the vaccine.  In 1922, the Court held that states also have the power to require certain vaccines for public school students. As a result, every state now has laws requiring some form of such mandatory vaccinations. It does not seem there currently is any significant political support for mandatory vaccinations.  But if things change and policymakers choose to enact mandatory vaccine laws, and such measures were reasonably medically necessary to protect public safety, those laws likely would withstand legal scrutiny.  Jeremy (Tennessee): Now that Don McGahn has agreed to testify in Congress, can Donald Trump try to block it? McGahn, who served as White House counsel during the Trump administration, was a key witness to Trump\u2019s potential obstruction of justice, according to Mueller\u2019s findings.  After a lengthy court battle, McGahn has now agreed to testify in the House Judiciary Committee, behind closed doors. Trump theoretically can try to block the testimony by filing a lawsuit claiming a legal privilege or immunity.  But he has tried this tack already, resulting in the prolonged court battle, and he has not filed any such motion thus far, despite McGahn\u2019s agreement to testify becoming public two weeks ago. It seems at this point McGahn\u2019s testimony will proceed.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Timothy Naftali is an associate clinical professor of public service at New York University and a CNN presidential historian. He is co-author of \u201cImpeachment: An American History\u201d with Jon Meacham, Peter Baker and Jeffrey A. Engel. The views expressed here are his. Read more opinion on CNN. Americans can be excused if they are confused by recent developments concerning the impeachment trial of former President Donald Trump next week. As lawmakers processed their trauma in the days following the January 6 insurrection, it seemed possible that both chambers of Congress might rebuke Trump for inciting right-wing extremists to launch a violent attack on the US Capitol. That possibility seemed to fade last week, however, when 45 Republican senators voted to dismiss the impeachment trial on the grounds that it would be unconstitutional, given that Donald Trump is no longer president. With almost 6 in 10 Americans saying they blame President Trump for the January 6 insurrection, according to a NPR/PBS NewsHour/Marist poll conducted in the days after the attack, is it really inevitable that this dark episode in US history will lead to a zombie Senate trial that mindlessly sleepwalks to an acquittal? Many historians don\u2019t like the idea of inevitability, since it denies the important role of individuals and institutions in bucking perceived trends. In that spirit, I believe there are three potential outcomes, not all of which are mutually exclusive, that would be better than where we seemed to be headed now. The Senate trial could be short-circuited now without a verdict. Alternatively, the Senate trial could be organized on a fundamentally different basis than Trump\u2019s first trial and kickstart a process of educating the public about the events that led to the insurrection. Finally, the energy that drove the House to impeach Trump a second time could be harnessed to launch an inquiry into the events of January 6 on the heels of the Senate trial. Even if the Senate acquits Trump, impeachment will have served an important purpose. I believe that we will one day look back on Trump\u2019s second impeachment as an act of political wisdom that deterred him from further executive overreach. Although Trump was impeached on January 13, 2021, with just one week left in his term, there was still time for him to inflict more damage on this country, especially through the use of the pardon power. Why America needs Trump's impeachment trial Andrew Johnson survived impeachment in 1868, and with just months left in his presidency, granted amnesty to the leaders of the Confederacy \u2014 including former Confederate President Jefferson Davis \u2014 to \u201creturn the love\u201d from the white South for defending him throughout his political ordeal, according to Johnson\u2019s biographer Annette Gordon-Reed. That amnesty contributed to the slow rewriting of history over the years that denied both the reality of the southern leaders\u2019 treason and their reason for seceding, which was to protect slavery. All Americans \u2014 and Black Americans, especially \u2014 are still paying the price for that big 19th century lie. While Trump pardoned his former chief strategist Steve Bannon, who was charged with fraud, and many others who were undeserving of executive mercy in his final hours as president, he could have gone further. Imagine if he had tried to pardon himself or those who had been arrested for participating in the Capitol riot. Keep in mind the former president told these people that he loved them. Initial reports suggest that the threat of a Senate trial over the insurrection may have stayed Trump\u2019s pardoning pen. Trump\u2019s impeachment trial will mark the first time a former president has been tried by the Congress. This is a big deal. The Constitution doesn\u2019t clarify whether the Senate has the legal standing to try a former official or private citizen and the closest precedent is the 1876 impeachment trial of William Belknap, who was the secretary of war \u2013 a precursor to today\u2019s secretary of defense. Reading the record of the Belknap trial as an historian \u2014 I am not a constitutional lawyer \u2014 I believe the Constitutional arguments both for and against trying a former official are persuasive. But the one that wins out for me is that the Founders left the Senate to do what it wished. Certainly that\u2019s what senators concluded in 1876. What wasn\u2019t murky in 1876 was Belknap\u2019s guilt. As secretary of war, Belknap controlled which private individuals got the legal right to supply food and dry goods to US Army forts. With many of these forts in isolated areas, these concessions were extremely profitable. The Belknap family took a kickback from one of these profiteers, who confessed under oath \u2014 and there were receipts. At the time, Congress was in high dudgeon about rampant corruption in the administration of then-President Ulysses S. Grant. The Democratic majority in the House was investigating other schemes by administration officials (the President\u2019s own brother, Orvil Grant, later admitted to profiting from running fort concessions). Belknap\u2019s resignation \u2014 which he coordinated with President Grant and took place just moments before the House was scheduled to vote on articles of impeachment \u2014 seemed to short circuit what would have been a way for Congress to highlight official corruption. This would be a costly mistake for progressives When the trial came to the Senate, then under a Republican majority, the issue of whether it was constitutional gave the president\u2019s supporters, along with senators who were against outlawing official corruption, an easy out. (The corruption of the Grant administration wasn\u2019t a partisan matter. The Republican Party, the President\u2019s party, was divided on the issue.) The Senate held a vote to determine whether the trial was constitutional. Democrats, along with the Republican reformers voted yes; Republican supporters of the status quo voted no. The vote was 37 to 29. Those who won the vote to proceed with the trial did not have enough votes to reach the two-thirds majority needed to convict Belknap. In the end, Belknap was acquitted on all five articles of impeachment, with each vote breaking in almost exactly the same way as the vote on constitutional standing. Does this mean the vote to convict or acquit Trump will mirror the 55-45 vote on January 26 determining the constitutionality of the Senate impeachment trial? As in 1876, it is likely that vote foreshadows Trump\u2019s acquittal. It appears that only one senator, Oliver P. Morton of Indiana, voted against the Senate having jurisdiction before he voted to convict Belknap on an article of impeachment. History rhymes but does it repeat? Not necessarily. Just one week after the Capitol riot, the House succeeded in building enough momentum to impeach Trump \u2014 quickly creating a deterrent against an even more egregious use of his pardon power and sending a message that there was bipartisan anger at Trump. But it is not a foregone conclusion that the Senate impeachment trial will occur at all. While the Senate killed a motion that Sen. Rand Paul introduced last week, challenging the constitutionality of trying Trump when he is no longer in office, another motion could be introduced \u2014 this time, with a two-thirds threshold instead of a simple majority. While it\u2019s unlikely, it\u2019s certainly possible, and it would provide a way for the Senate to avoid the worst outcome of all \u2014 a speedy trial that leads to acquittal. What Kyle Rittenhouse's fate reveals about 'law and order' If the Senate trial does proceed, then it is important to use it to conduct a thorough examination of January 6 and all possible connections between the president and the Capitol rioters who had bought into his lie that the 2020 election had been \u201cstolen.\u201d Keeping in mind that the Senate can do what it likes in an impeachment trial, let\u2019s review some precedents. In the heady summer of 1974, after bipartisan majorities in the House Judiciary Committee approved three articles of impeachment, Senate leaders began planning, in a bipartisan fashion, the trial of President Richard Nixon. Since the Supreme Court had just decided in US v. Nixon, that the president would have to turn over more of his infamous White House tapes to the district court, the senators understood that the trial could not be based solely on evidence that was available to the House. Although Nixon\u2019s resignation ended the perceived need for a trial, Senate leaders left a draft of how they would have conducted it. The Constitution leaves it up to the Senate to determine how to conduct a trial. In 1974, the Senate was prepared to reopen the investigation to introduce new evidence. Senate leaders agreed to broad latitude on the part of the House managers, adopting discovery (or investigation) rules from civil trials and not criminal trials. As a result, the managers could introduce practically whatever they needed to make their case. Nixon\u2019s lawyer at the time wrote that the proposed Senate rules would allow a \u201cblunderbuss intrusion into the Executive branch.\u201d The Senate leaders also wished to ensure that no evidence could be withheld in the trial \u201con the grounds of national security.\u201d President Trump\u2019s first Senate trial didn\u2019t follow the Nixon-era model. Instead, Mitch McConnell, who was the Senate majority leader, adopted the approach devised by a bipartisan group of senators for the 1999 impeachment trial of President Bill Clinton, which narrowly defined the admissibility of new evidence, leaving it up to the senators to vote, after the trial began, as to whether they needed to hear from witnesses. The fight over Marjorie Taylor Greene poses a threat to the entire country In 1974, Senate Majority Leader Mike Mansfield and Minority Leader Hugh Scott expected Nixon to be convicted, while both Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott and Senate Minority Leader Tom Daschle in 1999 assumed Clinton would be acquitted. The rules each pair of Senate leaders adopted reflected how they viewed the case at hand. Given the Constitution\u2019s silence on the structure of any Senate trial, the Lott-Daschle approach was as constitutional as the Mansfield-Scott approach. The fact that McConnell went with the Lott-Daschle approach for Trump\u2019s first impeachment trial 2020 doesn\u2019t mean that Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer has to do the same in 2021. What would employing the Nixon model instead of the Clinton precedent mean in 2021? This is key because Trump and his lawyers will not be able to stonewall this trial as they did so successfully in his first Senate trial. His executive privilege now only extends to the presidential records of his term. That means the House impeachment managers could now have broad access to records about January 6 and the days before from the Justice Department (including the FBI), DC police, Homeland Security and the Pentagon. These are federal, not presidential, records. The Biden administration could, of course, use executive privilege to prevent some federal records from being introduced, but Congressional leaders could work with the administration to seek common ground. The impeachment managers should take advantage of this access and build on the Nixon model to introduce a wide swath of evidence, including testimony from witnesses. In a televised trial akin to the Watergate hearings, senators could interview those witnesses, including law enforcement officers and others involved in the events leading up to the attack on the Capitol on January 6. How I felt seeing guys like me at the Capitol riot The public could hear from those who financed and organized the rally where President Trump urged his followers to march to the Capitol and \u201cshow strength.\u201d They could hear from participants who broke into the Capitol, learning why they thought this was a patriotic act. The impeachment managers could tell the story of the last hours of Capitol Police Officer Brian Sicknick, who died in the attack, or lay out the timeline showing who finally deployed the National Guard and when. It is possible, though not likely, that the hearing could create enough legitimate anger, sadness and fear to shift public opinion and convince enough senators to convict the former president. Even if it didn\u2019t, this public trial \u2014 with all its evidence \u2014 would help people of conscience to better understand the ramifications of the Capitol attack and the dangers of extreme polarization in our politics. An approach like this would ultimately lead to a longer Senate trial. If Senate leaders Schumer and McConnell still want to keep the trial as short as possible, as reports have indicated, Congress could also establish a 9/11-type commission to present the American people with a clear and thorough summary of what happened on January 6. The commission should have bipartisan support, and congressional leaders should consider announcing this investigation in a way that blunts any gloating we might hear from Trump in the event he is acquitted. Democrats are in control of the executive and legislative branches. And, just as importantly, there is an emerging bipartisan group on Capitol Hill that agrees that Trump is a threat to the country. Trump also poses a political problem for the now-fractured GOP, and there are certainly Republicans who would like to bar him from running for president in 2024. Democrats need to work across the aisle and reach out to the 10 Republicans in the House who voted to impeach Trump for a second time and the five Senators who voted in favor of proceeding with the trial. Together, they could coordinate a strategy to introduce witnesses and weaken Trumpism, regardless of the outcome of the trial.  If the Senate does not follow an expanded Nixon model for the forthcoming impeachment trial, Democratic leaders and their few Republican allies should waste no time in laying the ground for a bipartisan investigation of January 6, either in the style of the Senate Watergate investigation or the 9/11 Commission. The Trump trial, especially if it leads to an acquittal, must not be the last word. While the Biden administration focuses on the pandemic, there is still enough oxygen in Washington to conduct a dramatic and educational impeachment trial and a bipartisan investigation into the day our Constitution came under assault.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Sign up to get our new weekly column as a newsletter. We\u2019re looking back at the strongest, smartest opinion takes of the week from CNN and other outlets. In October, 1954, a chronically ill US senator from Massachusetts, John F. Kennedy, checked into New York\u2019s Hospital for Special Surgery for an operation to treat recurring back pain. When he developed an infection after surgery, his prognosis was so poor that a priest was called to give last rites. During his slow recovery, Kennedy worked on a book project \u2014 with his gifted aide Ted Sorensen playing the central role \u2014 that became \u201cProfiles in Courage.\u201d It was six years before Kennedy would be elected president, nine years before he would be assassinated in a motorcade in Dallas. The book, which told the stories of senators who had risked their careers for standing by their principles, became a best seller and won the Pulitzer Prize for biography. If Americans understood, the book suggested, \u201cthe terrible pressures which discourage\u201d a politician from taking an unpopular stance \u2014 the possible \u201closs of his friends, his fortune, his contentment, even the esteem of his fellow men\u201d \u2013 they might be \u201cmore appreciative of those still able to follow the path of courage.\u201d Those pressures are intense. As former Rep. Charlie Dent, a Republican who\u2019s spoken out against President Donald Trump wrote, \u201c\u2018Profiles in Courage\u2019 is a thin book for a reason.\u201d But on Wednesday, at risk of political and personal harm, some Republicans, including one of their leaders, Rep. Liz Cheney, joined with Democrats in impeaching Trump for summoning a siege of the Capitol to stop the counting of Joe Biden\u2019s electoral votes on January 6. \u201cWhile many House Republicans reportedly supported impeachment,\u201d Dent observed in a second piece, \u201conly 10 courageous GOP members actually voted for it. If the Senate were to convict Trump and prohibit him from ever seeking high office again, many House Republicans would be most grateful and relieved. It\u2019s called \u2018hope yes, vote no.\u2019\u201d It was the second impeachment for Trump \u2014 unprecedented in US history. The first time, no House Republican voted \u201caye,\u201d and in the Senate, only one Republican, Mitt Romney, voted to remove him from office. Lt. Gen. Ken Keen, a former military deputy commander of US Southern Command, served 38 years in the US Army.  \u201cWe ask our military and our young men and women in uniform to put their lives on the line every day in defense of our country,\u201d he wrote. \u201cIf political leaders are not ready to do the same and put their careers at risk by taking a stand against those whose actions may have provoked or encouraged the attack on our Capitol, resulting in the death of five Americans, they should resign. They are in the wrong role and do not deserve the honor and privilege to be our leaders.\u201d When rioters stormed the Capitol, Rep. Cheri Bustos, a Democrat from Illinois, felt the danger. \u201cMy goal was to survive,\u201d she wrote, \u201cI quickly realized I was too tall to hide under the seats. I learned in a hurry how to use a gas mask. We evacuated to the safest room we could find \u2026\u201d  \u201cWhat happened on January 6 was NOT a political act. It was a crime. Violent. Vicious. Premeditated. Lethal. Everyone who incited it and everyone who committed it are perpetrators. And calls for \u2018unity\u2019 cannot be simultaneous excuses for this violence. To achieve unity, we must also deliver accountability and justice. I am not a prosecutor and cannot try Donald Trump in a court of law. Impeachment is the only means I have available to stop him from inciting further acts of mayhem, bloodshed and insurrection.\u201d Historian Julian Zelizer said Trump\u2019s two impeachments will be remembered as a warning \u201cof the immense dangers that our republic has found itself in after the radicalization of the Republican Party resulted in a near total abandonment of norms and institutional restraints. When partisanship triumphed over the needs of governance and the health of our democratic institutions, violence ensued.\u201d Republicans who voted against impeaching Trump, Frida Ghitis wrote, were mostly \u201cduplicitous opportunists who claimed at the last moment that the country needed unity after they had contributed to the rhetoric bringing the nation to the precipice of civil war.\u201d Arick Wierson and Bradley Honan observed that, \u201cfor every Liz Cheney, there are more than a dozen elected GOP officials who are still committed to Trump. Despite the fact that Republicans lost control of the House, Senate and White House during Trump\u2019s term, all signs suggest he will continue to control the party as its de facto leader, weighing down the more traditional wing of the party from wresting back control.\u201d Former FBI agent Asha Rangappa pointed out that \u201cthe people who planned and participated in this atrocity will get a knock on their doors from the FBI soon enough. But the domestic terror threat is not limited to that one mob. The very fact that the FBI has issued a threat bulletin to all 50 states reveals that the depraved ideology based on the lie about the \u2018rigged\u2019 election spreads far and deep.\u201d She argued, \u201cIt is hard to understand how \u2014 particularly in light of the many threats of violence made openly by pro-Trump groups and individuals on social media \u2014 the FBI and its law enforcement partners were not better prepared for what took place.\u201d At noon Wednesday, Joseph Robinette Biden Jr. is due to take the oath of office as 46th president of the United States in an inauguration that will look unlike any other, given the security threat and the Covid-19 pandemic. The 45th president, who for months refused to commit to a peaceful transfer of power, is breaking with tradition by not planning to attend Biden\u2019s swearing-in. That\u2019s not really a surprise. Trump\u2019s approach to the presidency is the same as the M.O. he brought to the business world, David Axelrod noted: \u201cflagrantly defying rules and norms and undermining institutions.\u201d \u201cFrom the moment he descended the Trump Tower escalator in June 2015 and entered national politics with a barrage of incendiary, racist tripe, Trump has routinely and scurrilously lied and sold his self-serving version of events and conspiracy theories. He has willfully and cynically divided and inflamed the country he was elected to lead to suit his own ends.\u201d Trump\u2019s father taught him that there are two kinds of people \u2013 killers and losers, as Axelrod pointed out. \u201cThe violent insurrection against the US Capitol and our democracy will be his epitaph. The threat of legal action and disbarment from public office in the future still looms. But the President already has suffered the most painful penalty of all: Fred Trump\u2019s boy will go home a loser.\u201d Trump is one of only four presidents in the last century to be denied a second term by voters. As a young Bill Clinton campaign staffer, Paul Begala was there the last time America fired a president: George H. W. Bush. The outgoing president was clearly feeling the pain of his loss in 1992, Begala recalled, but he was \u201cdignity personified \u2026 This is where Bush\u2019s amazing grace came in. He was a wounded politician, but more than that he was a patriot.\u201d Clinton told Begala he still recalls the gracious welcome he received at the White House from George and Barbara Bush.

Sterling: Capitol rioters made a mockery of Christian values Joe Lockhart: Call out Trump\u2019s big lie. To Democrats in the House, impeaching Trump was an easy call. The more complicated question is how to handle a trial in the Senate, since the Republican majority leader, Sen. Mitch McConnell, hasn\u2019t indicated he favors holding it before the end of Trump\u2019s term. For the incoming president, the trial poses a dilemma since it threatens to slow both the confirmation of Biden\u2019s Cabinet and the aggressive initiatives he has outlined to fight Covid-19 and revive the economy. Some Republicans contend that moving ahead with the trial would be divisive. But Garry Kasparov argued that it\u2019s a mistake to \u201csacrifice justice for unity. Russians learned this in the hardest possible way after the fall of the Soviet Union.\u201d Leaders decided to abandon a serious investigation of the abuses of the \u201cKGB security state in the interest of national harmony. It would be too traumatic, our leaders said, to expose the countless atrocities the Soviet security forces committed and to punish their authors \u2026 The KGB\u2019s name was changed to the FSB and its members quietly stayed in touch and intact. The result? A mere nine years after the Soviet Union collapsed in 1991, Russia elected a former KGB lieutenant colonel, Vladimir Putin, to the presidency. It was the last meaningful election we ever had. We chose unity and we got dictatorship. America should not make a similar mistake.\u201d GOP senators are wrestling with many questions, wrote Scott Jennings: \u201cI am sure many \u2014 if not most \u2014 senators are asking: If Trump\u2019s conduct isn\u2019t impeachable, then what is? \u2026 If a senator believes Trump to be the wrong person to lead the Republican Party moving forward, and/or that he must be punished for subversive actions, the question then becomes: Does convicting him make him go away faster or does it make him a martyr?\u201d For more on politics: Steven A.

It\u2019s also the one-year anniversary of the first confirmed Covid-19 case in the US \u2014 that of a 35-year-old man who survived. \u201cSince that time, more than 23 million Americans (almost 7% of the population) have been diagnosed with the infection and at least 385,000 have died,\u201d Dr. Kent Sepkowitz wrote. \u201cIn response, effective treatments, public health containment strategies and vaccines have been developed, but the pandemic continues to worsen, both in the US and in other parts of the world.\u201d The reality, Sepkowitz noted, is that some of the advice he and other doctors gave in the early months of the pandemic proved to be incorrect. \u201cThe year has been extremely humbling. We infectious disease specialists have been wrong repeatedly \u2014 a predictable problem with a once-in-a-century event, but still.\u201d At first, doctors minimized the risk and said mask-wearing wasn\u2019t necessary. US scientists stumbled in developing reliable tests to diagnose the disease. Now there\u2019s hope in the form of vaccines, although their rollout has been much slower than predicted. \u201cThe Biden team surely is aware of what lies ahead,\u201d Sepkowitz observed. \u201cWe can only hope that its decisions will rely on evidence, sound judgment and, most of all, the lonely humility of a doctor caring for a critically ill patient.\u201d As people in the highest priority groups, including those age 65 and older and those with compromised immune systems, scrambled this week to find a way to get one of the vaccines, Dr. Megan Ranney wrote that \u201cthe vaccine does not have to be as scarce as it is. Miscommunication from health officials and an underprepared vaccine distribution system can hinder vaccine administration just as much as slow vaccine production. While some places are overwhelmed by demand, other clinics have thrown out unused doses when individuals did not show up for their injections.\u201d Martin Luther King Jr. Day this year is especially resonant in the aftermath of the Capitol riot, wrote historian Peniel E. Joseph, author of \u201cThe Sword and the Shield: The Revolutionary Lives of Malcolm X and Martin Luther King Jr.\u201d \u201cThe roots of the White supremacist tree that has flourished in the age of Trump are deep, and King combated these forces in his own time with a moral force and power that turned him into a radical political agitator who broke with his former political ally, President Lyndon B. Johnson, on the issue of Vietnam and a revolutionary human rights leader who vowed to help end militarism, racism and materialism before it destroyed American society,\u201d Joseph wrote. \u201cKing would surely shy away from using his holiday as an example of American exceptionalism \u2014 and would instead push us toward the hard work of building, for the first time in our nation\u2019s history, a racially inclusive democracy that will ensure that this latest attack on the sacred citadel of American democracy will be the last.\u201d Kate Maltby: How much of \u2018Bridgerton\u2019 is forgivable?

As Laura Beers noted, when Sen. Josh Hawley\u2019s book contract was canceled because he continued to contest the election without providing solid evidence of fraud, Hawley groused, \u201cThis could not be more Orwellian \u2026 This is the Left looking to cancel everyone they don\u2019t approve of.\u201d When a BBC presenter said Trump had inspired \u201cinsurrection,\u201d an adviser to the Trump campaign accused him of using \u201cOrwellian language to change what happened.\u201d Beers, a historian who is preparing to teach a course on Orwell, wrote that while he \u201copposed censorship, he abhorred the corruption of language by political leaders\u201d trying to cloak \u201cdubious or amoral actions\u201d in the \u201clanguage of bureaucracy and legalese, or the emotional language of patriotism. One of Orwell\u2019s deepest laments was that, during his lifetime, \u2018political speech and writing\u2019 had become \u2018largely the defense of the indefensible.\u2019\u201d \u201cMost likely,\u201d Beers added, \u201cOrwell would not have supported either the de-platforming of Trump, or the cancellation of Hawley\u2019s book contract. But he likely would also have despised both men for their cynical abuse of the English language.\u201d",

The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion articles on CNN How in the world do scores of seditious rioters simply waltz into the United States Capitol, so casually that many of them record their invasion on their phones and take selfies with cops? How do they scale the walls and push through the doors and scatter the police and not get forcibly stopped by whatever means necessary? How does anyone breach the House speaker\u2019s office and relax in her chair as if he owned the place? Two words: White supremacy. It\u2019s undeniable now, unmistakable. What happened on Wednesday was simple: Donald Trump told White people that America had been stolen from them, and he summoned them to Washington to take it back. He was their commander in chief, he gave them their marching orders, and all they had to do was obey. They saw insurrection as their duty, but also as their right. If these overwhelmingly White invaders had instead been Black, the news headline would have read: \u201cMassacre in the Nation\u2019s Capital.\u201d There is no damn way throngs of Black people could have similarly smashed their way into that citadel of world power without losing their lives en masse. Only with White privilege does such reprehensible behavior not meet deadly reprisals. The mob was later labeled criminals. But when they were rampaging, they were not treated as criminals. In fact, while listening to news coverage I heard one pundit say that the pride of America was how \u201cprotesters\u201d \u2013 in this case, she was talking about the rioters at the Capitol \u2013 were protected by the Constitution and thus not attacked by police in the streets. My mouth fell agape. She should have said that, in America, Whites enjoy the privilege of acting out as they please without fear of being brutalized by the police. In a video taken inside the Capitol during the invasion, a Black security guard is confronted and chased by angry White Trump supporters.  As he orders them to stop, they rush at him, seemingly with the aim of overcoming him. He screams into a shoulder microphone, \u201cI need back up! Send back up!\u201d as he races up flights of stairs, pursued by a crowd of audacious whiteness. The incident reminded me of scenes from D.W. Griffith\u2019s racist 1915 film, \u201cThe Birth of a Nation,\u201d in which White men chase Black men who run frantically for their lives. It\u2019s a caricature of race relations in a country that has never been honest about its history. The jarring, revealing video of Black men cleaning up the Capitol After the Capitol attack, President-elect Joe Biden said, \u201cAmerica is better than this.\u201d But herein lies the problem: America is NOT better than this. America IS this. White supremacy is unwilling to surrender its reign. It declared itself alive and well at the Capitol, and, for the most part that day, the authorities left it alone.  Four days later, authorities are identifying members of the mob, making arrests, and seemingly hunting down violators who overran and unashamedly damaged the Capitol. Many had dressed in attire so conspicuous that they seemed to want to be discovered. This, too, is American. Self-righteous White supremacy has never felt the need to hide. Consider our history of lynching. These hangings of Black bodies were never a one-person act. Indeed, lynchings were public events where entire communities of Whites gathered \u2013 including children \u2013 to watch and cheer as Black life was decimated. Lynching was an American ritual, something of an American tradition, which the government at that time did not decry, and for which few were every punished. So, no, America is not better than this. In fact, peaceful Black protesters in the 1960s were battered by fire hoses and attacked by dogs. Black elders were shoved and beaten like animals on live TV. No, we can\u2019t say America is better than what happened on Wednesday. Not unless we are willing to lie about our history, to turn a blind eye to the injustices suffered by the Scottsboro Boys or the Central Park Five or George Floyd. If we tell the truth, we will admit that Trump supporters\u2019 behavior is in the tradition of White supremacy in America, which is willing to destroy anyone and anything to retain its power. Imagine, again, if that mob had been Black. The rioters would not have gone safely home. They would have been arrested or beaten senseless or killed. I watched in total disbelief as the President asked his riotous followers to calm down and told them to go home. Go home? Who gets to break into the Capitol then go home? Aren\u2019t you at least taken downtown for questioning? Black, brown and many conscious White people watched the unfolding Capitol invasion with speechless awe, wondering who in the world gets to assault the American government without being destroyed? Well, now we know. Donald Trump's ultimate outrage This attempt at coup was precipitated because, since November, Trump has convinced himself and his followers that the election was rigged and stolen from him. The allegation is preposterous and borderline insane. But this strategy \u2013 composing lies to avoid difficult truth \u2013 is not a Trump creation. It\u2019s an American tradition. In antebellum days, many slave masters told themselves and others that their slaves were happy and content. Everyone knows that White settlers murdered Native Americans and took their lands, but that\u2019s too much truth to swallow, too much ugliness to admit, so we simply transmute this truth into the Thanksgiving holiday and perpetuate a myth of early colonial harmony. Another rejected truth is the caste system in America, which has locked Black and brown people into a prison of poverty from which many never escape. Americans like to say that any child willing to work hard can prosper. This isn\u2019t true, but we want to believe it, so we say it. Public school systems have for decades labeled Black children inferior and troubled and disadvantaged and underrepresented in ways that determine their scholastic achievement. Few want to admit that often the real problem is the assumptions made about Blackness and its inability to succeed. America maintains its glory by lying about its history and its shortcomings. Trump knows this game. If we blame him alone for this madness, we ignore the inner workings of racism and the fear that accompanies any challenge to White supremacy. And that\u2019s what Wednesday was really about \u2013 who are the true Americans? Those who stormed the Capitol believed they are. And from the way they were handled, it seems that many \u2013 but not all \u2013 police authorities agreed. In fact, the scarcity of law enforcement at all, from the beginning of the mutiny, suggests that too few in authority feared these insurgents or thought it prudent or necessary to guard against them. It is also true that some officers worked hard to keep the Capitol secure as the horde surged in. One officer died in the line of duty. For this, America should certainly be grateful. Yet I hold fast to the position that had authorities taken the threat seriously from the beginning, the 60 police injured in the invasion might not have needed to sacrifice themselves for our safety. One cop, apparently a Metropolitan police office who\u2019d arrived to help reinforce a pitifully outnumbered Capitol Police force \u2013 was seen in a horrendous viral video, pinned in a doorway screaming for help as the rioters in the doorway crushed him. Are his overwhelmingly White assailants \u2013 any of them? \u2013 in custody now?  Many truths will become apparent in the coming days. What we know for sure is that White supremacy is protected and respected in America, even when it is in full betrayal of the laws of the land. The inability and unwillingness of authorities to stop those who breached Capitol Hill security reminds Black and brown people not to forget their place in this land. \u201cYou can\u2019t do what White folks do,\u201d my father used to tell me. On Wednesday, his warning became abundantly clear.",

The views expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion at CNN. Our government was created with checks and balances to ensure no President would ever become king. When we fail to hold our elected leaders to account, bad actors are emboldened and abuse of power becomes all the more likely. This is why Democrats are strongly considering impeaching President Donald Trump for a second time. While certain cabinet members have discussed the possibility of invoking the 25th Amendment to remove Trump from office, it seems Vice President Mike Pence is unlikely to jump on board. With Pence reluctant to act, Democrats are considering fast-tracking the impeachment process with less than two weeks left before Inauguration Day. The sense of urgency is understandable. This week, President Trump incited an insurrection at the US Capitol. This was the culmination of a monthslong campaign to overturn the 2020 election. President Trump, who refused to commit to a peaceful transfer of power in September, set the stage by repeatedly spewing lies that the election had been stolen from him. On Wednesday, a pro-Trump mob stormed the Capitol as members of Congress were certifying the result of the election. It didn\u2019t take a rocket scientist to see this coming. Among the rioters were those linked to QAnon and the Proud Boys \u2014 two right-wing extremist groups that Trump refused to condemn during his 2020 reelection campaign. The President\u2019s Twitter feed also advertised the event. On December 19, Trump tweeted, \u201cBig protest in D.C. on January 6th. Be there, will be wild!\u201d Hours before the chaos started, President Trump and his personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani addressed the crowds gathered in Washington. Trump told them to walk down to the Capitol, saying, \u201cWe are going to cheer on our brave senators and congressmen and women and we are probably not going to be cheering so much for some of them \u2014 because you will never take back our country with weakness.\u201d Giuliani, on the other hand, said: \u201cLet\u2019s have trial by combat.\u201d America was lucky to be saved by its democracy -- even if some don't realize it As the mob stormed Capitol Hill, the President was initially \u201cconfused about why other people on his team weren\u2019t as excited as he was as you had rioters pushing against Capitol Police trying to get into the building,\u201d according to Sen. Ben Sasse, citing conversations with senior White House officials. When Trump finally released a recorded statement on video, he continued to show his sympathy with the mob and reiterated lies about a stolen election. \u201cGo home, we love you,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re very special.\u201d His daughter Ivanka Trump called the rioters \u201cAmerican Patriots\u201d in a tweet she later deleted. In the end, a Capitol police officer died from injuries he sustained while engaging the rioters, while a woman who participated in the insurrection died after she was shot by Capitol Police. Three others died from apparent medical emergencies. What we saw on January 6, 2021, was unprecedented: The President of the United States incited an attack on Congress. It was an attack not just on the Capitol building, but on the legislators themselves. Last February, Rep. Adam Schiff delivered a prescient speech in his closing remarks during the impeachment trial. \u201cWe must say enough \u2014 enough! He has betrayed our national security, and he will do so again. He has compromised our elections, and he will do so again. You will not change him. You cannot constrain him. He is who he is. Truth matters little to him. What\u2019s right matters even less, and decency matters not at all.\u201d Unfortunately, no Republicans \u2014 save for Sen. Mitt Romney \u2014 were willing to convict Trump of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. Sen. Susan Collins, in defending her decision to acquit the President, assured everyone that he had learned \u201ca pretty big lesson.\u201d Her remark was laughable then. It\u2019s tragic now. Hold Trump accountable for incitement If Congress overlooks the failed insurrection without taking any kind of stand, it will leave a huge, gaping hole in the historical record when it comes to checking the executive office. While some will argue that impeachment is futile with less than two weeks to go until inauguration, a vote on the President\u2019s actions would set a valuable precedent. At the very least, Democrats could go on the record stating that any president who incites an attack on another branch of government should no longer have the privilege of holding office. The vote would also force Republicans to take a stand. Sen. Lindsay Graham tried to distance himself from the President after the rampage on Wednesday. \u201cI hate it to end this way \u2026 From my point of view, he\u2019s been a consequential president. But today, first thing you\u2019ll see. All I can say is, count me out. Enough is enough,\u201d he said. Already, Trump supporters are turning on Republican lawmakers, harassing Graham at the airport on Friday and calling him a \u201ctraitor.\u201d After members of the GOP stood by Trump and watched as he stoked his base with lies \u2014 all for the sake of maintaining their own hold on power, is it any wonder that this Faustian bargain is now backfiring? A few words aren\u2019t enough to atone for the last four years. Graham \u2014 along with other Republicans \u2014 should have to prove where he stands through a vote. The impeachment proceedings would face an uphill battle in the Senate \u2014 but if he is convicted, Trump could not only be removed but also disqualified from holding office in the future. Given the President\u2019s grip on the GOP, and talks of another run in 2024, this presents a huge opportunity for Senate Republicans to send a resounding message that Trump is unfit for office and should be barred from the White House once and for all. If Senate Republicans were serious about wanting to change the party, this would remove the threat of Trump\u2019s return.  Some Democrats will inevitably fear a backlash. But it\u2019s clear that they will have to face the fury of Trump\u2019s base \u2014 which has been fueled by misinformation and conspiracy theories \u2014 regardless of what they do or don\u2019t do, so they might as well stand up for what\u2019s right and defend our Constitution. Democrats will also have control of the presidency and both chambers of Congress, so they have some leeway to act boldly. It\u2019s time for Congress to take action and repudiate Trump before President-elect Joe Biden starts his term. If Congress doesn\u2019t do something, many Americans will be left wondering if the constitutional system of checks and balances means anything anymore.",

Most \u201cattempted coups\u201d elsewhere in the world leave a hangover of giddying uncertainty - shops shuttered, presidents in hiding, the television playing a nature documentary or half the staff in the hotel you are staying in not turning up for work. However, America\u2019s extraordinary privileges of law and functionality seemed to sustain, even in a brief moment of collapse. Wednesday was a six-hour catastrophic policing failure, one that finally served up an image of what the souring of democracy can look like, after years of appeasement and detachment by ordinary voters. Lock them up Yet still America woke up to relative order. The system had overnight thrived persistently - news networks broadcasting and dissecting the events, with variety and transparency, and the wheels of vote certification turning, as expected. Americans perhaps also took that for granted: that they turned on the TV to hear criticism of their president, that the police and national guard swooped in to enforce the law, that outrage - not fear at the new unknown - dominated. Chaos normally follows disorder, but in the United States the cogs kept whirring. It\u2019s been easy to say the US version of democracy was irreparably damaged by Wednesday, January 6. But, once Moscow, Beijing and Tehran have finished gloating briefly, remember too the signals that the day sent about its resilience. Yes, the United States witnessed a mob of mostly White men breaking into its Congress, because they felt the law was theirs alone, and because so many ordinary Americans spent four years thinking the horror was either too ridiculous to fear, or would just pass. But in the end, the quieter majority, not the loudest voice, remained standing. This short moment of ugly collapse should not lead Americans to dismiss the extraordinary eloquence and value of their system. The rioters abused the privileges of their wealthy democracy - their free lives, in the richest nation on earth - to indulge in a fantastical, parallel reality, and livestream on open social media their breaking into the seat of government. It was a spoilt child version of America - so \u201cfree\u201d to do whatever it wants, it ignored the truths, laws and decency that actually enabled that freedom. Elsewhere globally, scenes like these normally follow actual tyranny and absurd vote-rigging, palpable repression and torture - not fictional complaints that have had their (multiple) days in court. What Americans deserve to know after the deadly Capitol riot Wednesday\u2019s violence didn\u2019t really fit the conventional description of an \u201cattempted coup\u201d - normally a word evoked when the military or security forces help change who\u2019s in power. \u201cCoup\u201d became part of the day\u2019s hurried lexicon perhaps as what was happening was so alien and unimaginable - in a capital city so absorbed with the infallibility of its processes, that it didn\u2019t really have the vocabulary for this violence. But the less-privileged former Soviet Union - where even slight gasps of freedom have been very hard won - can offer comparisons as plentifully as Eskimos are said to have words for snow. This wasn\u2019t a \u201ccolored revolution\u201d - like the \u201cOrange\u201d one in Ukraine in 2004, where hundreds of thousands of patient protestors stood in the cold for months to successfully reverse a blatantly fraudulent election. It wasn\u2019t the \u201cTulip\u201d one of Kyrgyzstan in 2005, when protesters - some on horseback, also angry at a patently rigged vote - fought their way into the presidential administration, drank its liquor, rode on its exercise bikes, all while armed security forces were unwilling to open fire. It was uglier. It reminded me most of Ukraine in 2014, when an organized group of pro-Russian protesters forced their way into the local administrations of Donetsk and Slovyansk. The \u201cQ-Shaman\u201d would have fit right in that mob too. These brief, drunken moments of violence and shouting were the sparks that ignited a civil war which killed thousands. The media was also attacked then by the crowd, fired up by incendiary broadcasting from Russian state-media available in the east of the Ukraine. Crimea had earlier been invaded. It was a clockwork plan for occupation by Moscow. Hold Trump accountable for incitement But when you woke up each morning in Donetsk, the system continued to fall apart. In Washington DC, the opposite was true. The system is busying itself with rectifying the problem. The extraordinary privileges Americans live with daily - and that perversely led a handful to think the armed invasion of Capitol Hill was OK - were still there. The United States\u2019 allies and enemies will globally chew on this moment - for signs that it foments China\u2019s rise, or gives Putin another decade in power, or makes Maduro seem comparatively competent. Yet remember, between horror at what a sense of privilege among a small mob can do, there is also a moment of hope. Values worked. Unlike elsewhere in the past decades, the departing President\u2019s supporters did not take over parliament and change the government. The army did not switch sides. The rightful winner of the last election is not in hiding - he broadcast a speech, and will be president in several days. Two members of the slavishly loyal cabinet resigned. Trump has done damage to democracy\u2019s reputation globally in ways I never imagined I would see. President-elect Joe Biden is right to say it is \u201cfragile.\u201d It is also precious, and effective. For now, it worked. Trump and the domestic terrorism he fomented were - in this moment - defeated. There turned out to be enduring values at the heart of even some of the most compromised American elected officials. That is not a global norm.  Now is not a time for chest-thumping over American values that have slowly deteriorated for years to get to this point. But it should also not lead a country to be so spoiled in its own privileged system that it dismisses its extraordinary merits altogether. Democracy didn\u2019t fail the United States, it pretty much saved it. The singular reason the US system has advantages over its authoritarian rivals is that it is based on the open competition and truth of ideas. The morning after this failed coup,  the United States didn\u2019t wake up to a nature documentary on state TV, or find half the hotel staff missing, but was alive with a renewed vigor of self-criticism in rolling news coverage. They should be mindful of how they might appear to those who woke up that morning in actual tyrannies: Many perhaps taking for granted how lucky they are to live in a nation where such a staggering abuse of democracy can still be eclipsed by its virtues.",

The views expressed here are solely hers. Read more opinion on CNN. Collective trauma catches you off guard. Witnessing thousands of overwhelmingly White domestic terrorists who supported President Donald Trump storm the US Capitol on Wednesday, it felt like I was reliving America\u2019s most painful past \u2013 moments I\u2019ve experienced and echoes of those of my ancestors. For many Black Americans, myself included, it evoked a recurring nightmare. So many of us have felt that this nation has been teetering on the brink of chaos for a long time. We knew there would be a reckoning. As I watched the siege of the Capitol building, I recalled the George Floyd protests in Lafayette Park near the White House in June, where heavily armed law enforcement set off explosives and fired gas on peacefully gathered citizens of all races \u2013 some of them even on their knees with their hands up or lying flat on the ground. Photo after photo of that day, shows protesters being beaten, arrested and dispersed by police. Those people did not storm the Capitol or crash through police barriers. The crowd in the park that day \u2013 a few hundred people \u2013 did not try to shut down the government in the way that the mob did on Wednesday. All they wanted was equal justice and an end to the police killings of unarmed Black Americans. On Wednesday, I was haunted by images I\u2019ve seen of police attack dogs ripping open Black skin during the peaceful protests of the civil rights movement. I remembered the military vehicles confronting mostly Black crowds during the Black Lives Matter protests over the past several years. Vice President Pence, remove Trump now To be Black in America is to live with constant trauma. For Trump and many in the Republican party who seem more interested in taking America to the brink of a civil war for personal political gain rather than holding our nation together, the Lafayette Park protesters were criminals of the worst kind. \u201cWhat happened last night was a total disgrace,\u201d the President said at the time. He called the protests in the aftermath of Floyd\u2019s killing \u201cmob violence\u201d by the radical left and urged states to call in the military to shut down the protests. Trump stayed true to form on Wednesday. In the middle of the violence, he had only kind words for those storming the Capitol. Speaking to the nation, he clung to his delusions, reinforcing his dog-whistle rhetoric and baseless conspiracy theories about the election being stolen from him.  \u201cWe love you. You\u2019re very special people \u2026 and I know how you feel,\u201d Trump said as he asked the rioters to go home. The violent assault at the Capitol left four dead and multiple injuries among police and rioters. The DC police chief said 52 people were arrested Wednesday, but it remains to be seen how many others will be held accountable for breaking the law.  This is what it looks like when toxic White privilege is left unchecked and consistently encouraged by our nation\u2019s leaders and others in power. And we only have ourselves to blame. In America, structural racism has been allowed to fester. In every corner of our society, we\u2019ve legitimized and defended a culture where White bodies are valued over Black bodies. Too many of us have settled for baby steps toward full equality and justice. And now that we finally have been pushed to the brink, we are pushing back. That is why we shout Black Lives Matter. And now, more recently, Black Votes Matter. There is no doubt the Trump era has awakened hate and fear in many Americans, but it has also inspired Black Americans to discover a new patriotic pride, a steadfast determination and belief in the power of our collective voices. Look no further than the record Black voter turnout for the presidential election that put President-elect Joe Biden and Vice President-elect Kamala Harris in office, and the Georgia Senate races that saw Democrats Raphael Warnock and Jon Ossoff elected. That\u2019s the power of the Black vote. What the Warnock-Ossoff win tells us about a transforming South Black folk across the nation watched that siege and we knew in our souls that had those rioters been Black they would have faced deadly force long before they got inside the White House. So we fight smarter, by forcing this democracy to work for us. Still, I like many others, remain encouraged. The recent elections prove that a majority of Americans want change. They believe we can be a better nation. Wednesday was an ugly day in American history. But it would be a mistake to allow it to define us. Instead, let us learn that the politics of divide-and-conquer will destroy our nation. Biden said it best when he spoke to America during the insurrection: \u201cDemocracy is fragile.\u201d Let\u2019s take better care of it.",

He cohosts the podcast \u201cWords Matter.\u201d The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion at CNN. Every American who watched in horror as our Capitol was overrun by domestic terrorists on Wednesday has a right to know how this happened, why it happened, who is responsible and what we are going to do about it. If we gloss over the attack on our Capitol, January 6, 2021 may be seen in the rear view mirror as the worst day in our country\u2019s history. Moving on from this without holding the perpetrators accountable may very well sound the death knell of our democracy as we know it. Having worked in and around government for the past four decades, I know how important it is for federal officials to communicate with the American people during unprecedented times. Here is what we all deserve to know right now. First, we need to hear directly from Christopher Wray, the director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation. We don\u2019t need background quotes, tweets or written statements; we need Wray, along with our federal law enforcement officials, to stand at a podium on live television and explain how Trump supporters, who had been organizing online for months, were allowed to storm the Capitol. The FBI might not have all the answers now \u2013 but we deserve to know exactly what they are planning to do to get them. The American people also deserve to know that everyone who participated in this act of seditious terror will be investigated and prosecuted under the law. That includes those who participated \u2013 many of the rioters proudly posed for photographs and documented their actions on social media \u2013 along with those like Trump\u2019s personal lawyer, Rudy Giuliani, who goaded these domestic terrorists with calls to arms. President-elect Joe Biden has been pitch perfect in his responses so far. But he needs to continue driving home the point that defending our democracy will be his priority when he takes office and make it clear that he will not just let this pass. Lawlessness will not stand in the Biden administration. We can\u2019t unify and heal this country unless we bring these fascist thugs to justice. Whose job was it to restore order at the Capitol? Our leaders need to openly acknowledge how our justice system is tilted in favor of White Americans at the expense of Black people in this country. No one can escape the vivid images of White privilege on display yesterday in contrast to the heavy-handed police response against Black Lives Matter activists last summer. Democratic leaders also need to make clear how they will hold the President accountable. It is deeply disappointing and dangerous that Congress is now adjourned. Instead of taking swift action, this break signals that the President \u2013 who should be held responsible for inciting violence \u2013 will be allowed to act with impunity. The failure to act will only exacerbate domestic terrorism and fuel acts of sedition. Congress should move to impeach and convict Trump to bar him from holding office ever again. Initiating impeachment proceedings would also force Republican members of Congress to go on the record and declare whether they are on the side of Trump\u2019s fascist thugs or our democracy. At a minimum, lawmakers should censure Trump and condemn his actions. Republican leaders also need to take responsibility and look within their own party to confront those who helped encourage this insurrection. By spreading disinformation and trying to overturn the results of the election, Republican lawmakers have given domestic terrorists the justification to take matters into their own hands. The Republican Party must clean house before it can restore its credibility with the American people. Republican senators condemned the violence, but it was Sen. Mitt Romney who had the courage to tie this all back to the real source: President Donald Trump. The idea that Trump is going away on January 20 is woefully naive. Letting him get away with this unscathed will only tighten his grip on this corrupt and morally bankrupt party. Trump's infamy will never fade The President\u2019s cabinet also has a responsibility to seriously consider invoking the 25th amendment for the good of our country. If they believe Trump does not pose a clear and present danger to our nation, they should issue a public statement saying so. But they work for us, not the President, and they should \u2013 at the very least \u2013 sit down and have that discussion. They owe us this. I know from personal experience that a strong voice from a White House in crisis is critical to our country and our democracy. If White House Press Secretary Kayleigh McEnany can\u2019t face a free press and answer any questions after what happened yesterday, she should resign. Reading a prepared statement and then fleeing without facing questions just doesn\u2019t cut it. Regardless of whether White House officials decide to jump ship just days before the end of Trump\u2019s term, these staffers owe us all an explanation for their role during the President\u2019s reign of political terror. We pay their salaries, and a clear-eyed explanation of what happened and why they chose to stand behind Trump might help avoid another dangerous presidency. Trump has revealed to all of us how unprincipled politicians will continue to recklessly play with fire until we all get burned. Every time we let Trump and his henchman get away with something, they are emboldened to try something even more sinister. Simply put, we have to make the political pain of this disturbing behavior disproportionally higher than the political gain of malfeasance.  Too many Republican leaders today are more interested in preserving their own power than protecting our democracy. But failing to act now could very well turn yesterday\u2019s events from an ugly and shameful episode into a pivotal turning point that sparks the destruction of our democracy. It is impossible to overestimate what\u2019s at stake if we don\u2019t move quickly and decisively to crush the anti-democratic forces that threaten us all.",

            "article_content": "When Nikki Hudson drove to a local strip mall in Worthington, Ohio, to collect a corsage for her daughter\u2019s homecoming, she was met with two billboards plastered with her name. One declared her a failure. The other said she should put kids before her political agenda. \u201cIt\u2019s like nothing you would ever imagine in a local race,\u201d Hudson told CNN. She\u2019s talking about her race for reelection to the Worthington School Board. Four years ago she remembers going door to door in the well-off suburbs of Columbus, trying to drum up interest in her platform of tackling the ageing school infrastructure. She came top of the ballot with more than 7,000 votes in what felt like a traditional local contest. But this year, the fractured national political climate has been replicated in heated school board meetings over issues like mask mandates and race equity. That passion is now being reflected in contentious elections in Ohio and across the country, many with a new, negative undercurrent in the traditionally low-interest polls. In Worthington, the billboards, yard signs, negative mailers and door hangers are more reminiscent of a divisive presidential or hotly contested congressional race than what would be expected for an off-year vote in the grass roots of American democracy. You have become our enemies and you will be removed, one way or the other. Letter mailed to Worthington school board members Hudson and other board members say they have received threats from members of the community in email, texts and mail. One mailed letter said, \u201cWe are coming after you,\u201d and that board members should be tried for treason, in part for \u201cpoisoning the minds of children\u201d because of the belief the board is mandating critical race theory. Hudson said that\u2019s not the case. \u201cWe want to be a part of selecting the curriculum for our children. We will protest in front of your homes, day and night,\u201d the letter said. The letter was postmarked in Columbus, and said it was from a member of a group called Citizens to Remove CRT From America. CNN could not find a record of the group. \u201cYou have become our enemies and you will be removed, one way or the other. Have a miserable, miserable day for the rest of your life you filthy traitor,\u201d the letter said. Hudson said she expected to be challenged on her decisions, which have been far from universally popular, particularly a board vote to end a contract with police to provide school resource officers that triggered debates about race and law enforcement. Worthington voters will get their democratic say on whether Hudson deserves another term, but she did not expect the vitriol facing her from billboards and yard signs across the neighborhood. \u201cThey are putting tens of thousands of dollars into targeting me and smearing me,\u201d said Hudson. She doesn\u2019t even know who is funding some of the opposition For instance, the billboards are cloaked behind an organization called \u201cSave Worthington Schools,\u201d which became an LLC in August 2021. CNN has been unable to contact any people associated with the group despite emails and phone calls. \u201cIt is essentially dark money,\u201d  Hudson said about the lack of transparency. \u201cAs a school board member, when you have someone in your community that is upset about an issue or a decision, the first thing that you do is engage and you have conversations so that you can better understand their viewpoint and what\u2019s going on. This structure allows zero opportunity to engage.\u201d The negative attacks and the mailed threats have made her more hesitant, even though she said she is ready to have passionate discussions around schools. \u201cI just am very just very cautious knocking on doors,\u201d she said. \u201cI still do it, but it definitely has a different feeling right now.\u201d Hudson\u2019s fellow school board member Charlie Wilson, who\u2019s lived in the mostly White, upper-middle-class town for 40 years, said he\u2019s experienced strong objections to some of his stances, but not personal attacks. \u201cThese so-called outsider groups are sending out scurrilous, untrue, highly defamatory attacks on a school board member who is running for reelection,\u201d said Wilson, whose position is not up for vote this year. \u201cAnd we\u2019ve certainly never seen anything like that.\u201d Wilson, a past president of the National School Boards Association, said he\u2019s been aware of intense votes in big cities but this year the pressure is widespread and particularly charged. School board group asks for federal help to stop threats and violence in debates on Covid and critical race theory Coupled with the anti-Hudson billboards, are yard signs on tidy front lawns around Worthington, that seem innocent enough. They promote a slate of three school board candidates, \u2013 Jennifer Best, Kelli Davis and Brian Steel \u2013 to fill the three positions up for election. But Davis said she has nothing to do with the other candidates and condemns the use of her name alongside others. Steel said he wasn\u2019t consulted. Board incumbent Best told CNN she also didn\u2019t know about the signs before they were made and is focused on running her own campaign. Davis said the arrival of the signs provoked such tension, she released a statement condemning them, despite the promotion of her candidacy. \u201cI tried to kindly and respectfully make things clear, but as things got more and more negative and more and more name calling, I felt that it was really important for people to understand that I have no part in that,\u201d said Davis. The signs come from a group called OneWorthington, which seems to have a singular goal of unseating Hudson. Its website has a litany of criticism of Hudson, with clips from board meetings, text exchanges among people in town, and other details in a blog format. The group does not publicize its leadership or membership, but in an email exchange with CNN, claimed to be comprised of \u201cdozens\u201d of local residents with \u201chundreds of other local parents cheering us on.\u201d We\u2019re a group of many different Worthington parents who care about our kids. We want them to get a good education and we want to bring common sense back to our schools Christine Scott, backer of new group getting involved in school board electioins It declined to offer more details about its donors, stating it keeps \u201cmuch of what we do to ourselves\u201d to stop Hudson and others from targeting them. But the group did email a statement from Christine Scott, a Worthington parent and member of OneWorthington. \u201cWe\u2019re a group of many different Worthington parents who care about our kids. We want them to get a good education and we want to bring common sense back to our schools,\u201d Scott wrote. \u201cNikki Hudson has been a divisive leader on the board, uninterested in listening to the community and building consensus, and unsupportive of our administrators and teachers.\u201d The statement went on to say the group was not part of any candidate\u2019s campaign, but selected whom they favored to promote on the yard signs. \u201cWe act independently and make our own independent judgments. We have broad support in this community, and we expect you to include that fact in your story.\u201d Hudson, who said she has the support of the local teachers\u2019 union, accused OneWorthington of attacking her personally while hiding behind anonymity. She also said OneWorthington has \u201cpushed misinformation and orchestrated personal attacks against me, even though most board decisions have had unanimous board support.\u201d This year\u2019s attention on school board races, including from outside groups, perhaps shows a growing understanding of how much these positions can impact lives. The pandemic and questions over school openings and masks made more people care, Hudson\u2019s school board colleague Wilson said. Opinion: When parents scream at school board meetings, how can I teach their children? \u201cNormally it really doesn\u2019t matter that much, because normally every kid\u2019s in school all the time,\u201d he said. \u201cBut when you get into a pandemic situation, we really do have quite a bit of authority on things that really matter. Especially for parents, when it\u2019s your kid \u2026 there\u2019s nothing more important to you when you think that some public official is not doing what\u2019s best for your kid.\u201d About 10 miles from Worthington, in Westerville, Ohio, feelings about whether masking has been right for kids have been the center of conversation for its school board. The school district adopted a masking policy, angering many in town who protested in favor of parental choice. Rick Vilardo, who has served two terms for a total of eight years, was set to run for reelection. But he changed his mind when the atmosphere became so poisonous during the mask debate that the school board could not reach its usual consensus on the way forward. He grows emotional when talking about his decision to not run again. \u201cIn this community, and many communities across the country, we\u2019re developing a divide that people don\u2019t seem to want to bridge,\u201d said Vilardo. \u201cAnd to me, I\u2019m trying to build bridges.\u201d He wishes the town would realize they agree, as he puts it, on 80 to 90% of issues, but the 10% of thornier issues is keeping anything from getting done. Where Vilardo saw no way forward, others see an opening. Ryan Girdusky is highly engaged in school board contests this year, including some in Ohio though not Hudson\u2019s race, even though he has no children in the schools \u2013 or any children at all. From his home in Queens, New York, he launched the 1776 Project PAC, which he describes as the first national super PAC for school board elections. It supports candidates opposed to critical race theory in education and who favor a \u201cmore patriotic curriculum\u201d as well as continuing initiatives like the controversial gifted and talented program that was just dismantled in New York City. Girdusky said the PAC has raised $250,000, and is spending $125,000 supporting 50 candidates in 29 school districts across seven states  in this upcoming cycle. His efforts primarily go towards slates of candidates, with a hope of gaining a majority to control school board votes. Girdusky believes he can have an impact, noting some races are decided by just a few votes. \u201cThe money is going to primarily mailers, digital ads, text messaging, stuff like that,\u201d Girdusky said. \u201cA little money can impact a lot of people.\u201d Girdusky said he was motivated by family and friends frustrated by what they are seeing in their schools. Previously, he was part of local GOP efforts in Queens, and eventually became a consultant, contributor and writer for various right-leaning media sites like the Washington Examiner, Daily Caller and has appeared on OANN. Opinion: Parental control is a smoke screen for right-wing activists He bats away assertions that large political action committees have no role in the local decision-making of school board elections, pointing out that teachers\u2019 unions have long been involved. He said he is aware of the pressure incumbent school board candidates are feeling around the country, and welcomes it. \u201cGood,\u201d he said. \u201cThey are not physically threatened. Their incumbency is threatened.\u201d Other rare and bold efforts to flip school boards are playing out across the country. Iowa Gov. Kim Reynolds, a Republican who has championed giving parents more choice in schools, is getting involved in this year\u2019s nonpartisan board elections, going so far as to endorse one candidate. In Pennsylvania, one man has given $500,000 to be split among 50 local PACs to help boost certain conservative candidates, The Philadelphia Inquirer reported. In the week since Hudson first talked to CNN about how school board races are changing, she\u2019s learned two more billboards against her are going up.  Door hangers and mailers declaring her a \u201ccontroversial board member\u201d and the board\u2019s \u201cbad apple\u201d are being distributed by paid canvassers, she said. She continues to push back on what she said are unfair or untrue characterizations, but she has decided to admit the impact on her mental health \u2013 something she\u2019s resisted before, not wanting to give her attackers any satisfaction. It\u2019s incredibly challenging. It\u2019s day in and day out, 24/7 Nikki Hudson, school board member standing for re-election \u201cI\u2019m not OK,\u201d she told CNN, describing a constant tightness in her chest. \u201cIt\u2019s incredibly challenging. It\u2019s day in and day out, 24/7.\u201d She grew emotional as she talked. \u201cWhile I want our children to recognize that you don\u2019t back down to bullies, I also want them to know it\u2019s OK to say when they\u2019re not OK.\u201d She worries about all the others facing similar battles and for the future of school boards and the work they do. Even with early voting already underway, her own race is sometimes not even top of mind. \u201cWhether I lose or I win, something has to change,\u201d she said.

            "article_content": "Watching from her home in the suburbs of Philadelphia, Clarice Schillinger wasn\u2019t surprised when Glenn Youngkin \u2013 riding parents\u2019 fears and frustrations with schools \u2013 won the Virginia governor\u2019s race. She says she saw the writing on the wall. \u201cI hope that the race in Virginia really woke a lot of people up and said, OK, there is a groundswell of parents,\u201d Schillinger said. Tense school board meetings across the country illustrate the political divides playing out in public schools right now, from debates about the teaching of critical race theory to the enforcement of mask and vaccine mandates. But beyond the weekly fireworks, and beyond Virginia, there\u2019s a common thread tying many parents together: the feeling that they\u2019ve been ignored. A USA Today/Ipsos poll from early September found 55% of parents said their kids fell behind because of virtual learning during the coronavirus pandemic. And some of them blame the districts, teachers unions and politicians. Meanwhile, tens of thousands of parents are in Facebook groups focused on keeping schools open. A new Washington Post-ABC News poll found 48% of parents said they should have a lot of say in what their child\u2019s school teaches. Keri Rodrigues is president of the National Parents Union, a collective of organizations that work to empower parents\u2019 voices. \u201cThey\u2019re entirely right to say that we\u2019re angry. They\u2019re entirely wrong about what we\u2019re really angry about,\u201d Rodrigues said. \u201cI would tell you that 90 to 95% of the parents that I talked to are deeply angry, deeply frustrated, and deeply fearful, because they had the catastrophic failure of our public education system actually happen in their living rooms, and they saw it with their own two eyes.\u201d Rodrigues, a longtime Democratic organizer in Massachusetts, says CRT and other politicized issues serve as a distraction to the sources of more widespread parental concerns, like school shutdowns, transportation shortages, anxiety and depression, and student quarantines due to Covid-19. RELATED: Covid-19 driver shortage hits school districts and ride-hailing services \u201cIt\u2019s the fact that we closed schools, that we did not trust public health officials and scientists that told us when to reopen them,\u201d she said. \u201cIt\u2019s the fact that Democrats chose to listen to the special interest groups instead of their constituents in this moment \u2026 The majority of parents that I\u2019ve talked to are just not willing to back down and assume that the system is going to be able to take it from here.\u201d In Pennsylvania, Schillinger tried to harness those frustrations during this year\u2019s elections. The suburban mother, a Republican, helped run a political action committee called \u201cBack to School PA.\u201d The PAC pumped close to $700,000 into statewide school board elections, backing candidates who vowed to keep classrooms open. Most of the money came from a Republican venture capitalist who worked on the PAC with Schillinger. \u201cWe became a single-issue PAC,\u201d Schillinger said. \u201cHow could private do it safely, but public could not? The only thing that I could see that was the difference was special interest groups, like the (teachers) unions.\u201d Back to School PA supported more than 200 candidates across Pennsylvania, nearly two-thirds Republican, according to Schillinger. She says close to 60% of them won. \u201cWe gave the parents a voice to run and try to win,\u201d she said, adding that they\u2019ve heard concerns from thousands of parents across the state. Kerry Corrigan is one of those frustrated parents. She says she\u2019s on the verge of removing her sons from their public school in the Philadelphia suburbs. \u201cIf it closes down again, that\u2019s going to be the last straw,\u201d Corrigan said. She\u2019s opposed to school mask and vaccine mandates, but she says her top priority is keeping classrooms open. \u201cI am frustrated because I feel like the children are still trying to make up for last year,\u201d she said. Most of Back to School PA\u2019s money stayed in the Pennsylvania suburbs, but Schillinger argues this issue cuts across community lines. The PAC contributed $10,000 to Black Wall, a smaller progressive PAC focused on empowering Black and brown families in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. \u201cSome people said, how can you partner with them? They\u2019re supporting Republicans,\u201d Pastor Earl Harris, the founder of Black Wall, said. \u201cI don\u2019t (care) who they support, because there\u2019s an issue that cuts across all ethnic groups and age groups and party lines. It\u2019s your children.\u201d Harris says he believes schools in Harrisburg failed to provide necessary resources for families after class went virtual during the pandemic. Twenty-six percent of families in Harrisburg, a predominately African American city, were living below the poverty line before the pandemic hit. RELATED: USDA sends schools $1.5 billion to relieve student lunch crunch \u201cMost of the parents can\u2019t stay home because they don\u2019t have jobs that allow them to stay home,\u201d Harris said. \u201cThey don\u2019t have the hardware. They don\u2019t have the high-speed internet capacity. (They have) food insecurities. All of those factors were important to keeping schools open safely.\u201d Bethe Suarez, a formerly homeless mother of six in Harrisburg, says she supported virtual learning for the safety of her children, but she quickly faced problems getting them online and getting the help they needed. Now one of her daughters, who has a learning disability, can\u2019t keep up in class. And her other daughter doesn\u2019t feel challenged, so Suarez moved her from public school to an online program. \u201cI felt like my voice didn\u2019t matter,\u201d Suarez said. \u201c(The schools) dropped the ball, not being able to provide them with what they needed to brighten their future, to secure their future.\u201d Harris says that during this year\u2019s elections Black Wall backed three Democratic school board candidates who vowed to keep schools open, and all three won. One of those candidates, supported by Suarez, was Roslyn Copeland. \u201cSchools are our safe zone for our children,\u201d Copeland said about why she ran on keeping schools open. \u201cWe had a lot of our children that were already lacking \u2013 from low test scores to attendance to graduation rate.\u201d It\u2019s not clear the role education will play in next year\u2019s midterm elections in a state like Pennsylvania. A poll from Axios shows three-quarters of American parents believe local schools have done a somewhat or very good job balancing health and safety with other priorities. In Virginia\u2019s election, just under one-quarter of voters called education the most important issue, behind only the economy, according to CNN\u2019s exit poll. The recent Washington Post-ABC News poll found voters are split on which party they trust to handle education and schools, with 44% saying Democrats and 41% Republicans. Organizers from Virginia to Pennsylvania and beyond are already investing money to energize frustrated families, trying to weave that common concern into an electoral pattern. \u201cIt\u2019s a human issue,\u201d Harris said about frustrations with schools, adding that it\u2019s not just a concern in suburban communities. \u201cThe biggest frustration is being invisible.\u201d",

            "article_content": "After a year of contentious debates over mask mandates, social distancing rules and curriculums regarding race, new candidates challenged incumbent school board members Tuesday in elections across the country. Usually elected and unpaid, members of school boards found themselves on the front line of Covid politics and culture wars. Protests have erupted, shining a national spotlight on local boards that in the past dealt with less controversial decisions about district budgets and staffing. After months of contentious interactions, the National School Boards Association in October asked the federal government to help look into threats against school board members and educators \u2013 a move that drew sharp criticism from some Republican lawmakers for targeting parents who wish to speak out about the issues at their children\u2019s schools. RELATED: Voters made a hard turn back to kitchen table issues Despite the vitriol, some parents decided it was more important than ever to get involved. While there\u2019s no database tracking school board races across the country, new money funneling into races and a number of efforts to recall incumbents indicate that some boards will see a shakeup after Tuesday\u2019s elections. A statewide PAC in Pennsylvania, funded largely by venture capitalist and Bucks County parent Paul Martino, said that at least 101 of its candidates won their elections Tuesday, though results had yet to come in for some races too close to call as of Wednesday evening. Critical race theory debate heats up in schools across US The PAC, known as Back to School Pa, spent more than $600,000 to back 208 school board candidates in 54 communities across the state. They promoted a platform of keeping schools open for in-person learning even amid a fall or winter Covid surge. The group is bipartisan, though its candidates skewed Republican. Back to School Pa launched with a $10,000 donation from Martino to endorse 94 candidates in the primaries. Over the summer, it received applications from 200 additional local groups seeking money. It wrote checks worth $10,000 to each one it accepted and also provided campaign training. \u201cWe didn\u2019t support regions and parents based on the winnability of their districts. We didn\u2019t support groups based on wedge issues like masking or CRT (critical race theory). We supported those who aligned with us on a single issue of keeping our schools open, regardless of party,\u201d said Back to School Pa Executive Director Clarice Schillinger. Reimagine Radnor, a parent-led group located in a Philadelphia suburb, received funding from Back to School Pa. It backed four candidates who unsuccessfully ran to unseat members of the local school board Tuesday. They campaigned on removing politics from the board, though they were also endorsed by the local Republican Party. \u201cI think we\u2019re still up against the Trump effect,\u201d said Beth Connor, a former teacher with three children in the district who was backed by Reimagine Radnor. She says she\u2019s been registered as both a Democrat and a Republican in the past and ran largely because she felt national politics were seeping into the board\u2019s decisions. Still, the Republican-backed candidates in that suburb won a bigger percentage of the votes than they had in previous school board races, giving Connor hope that progress was made toward balancing the school board. \u201cWe moved the needle. There\u2019s a real movement about parents getting involved in their kids\u2019 education, and that I could be a little part of that is great,\u201d she said. There have been dozens of efforts to recall school board members across the 22 states that allow for them. It remains to be seen how many of those efforts will be successful, as many are still working on gathering enough signatures to put the recall to a vote. On Tuesday, a recall election for the Mequon-Thiensville School District in Wisconsin failed, as did one in Nemaha, Kansas. In San Francisco, where the school district remained closed for a majority of the 2020-2021 school year, those leading an effort to recall three of the school board members gathered enough signatures \u2013 more than 50,000 \u2013 to move the recall to a vote scheduled for February. Republican Glenn Youngkin, the projected winner of Tuesday\u2019s Virginia gubernatorial race, clearly thought that school issues would resonate with voters, making parental choice a centerpiece of his campaign. He rejected vaccine mandates for teachers and vowed that Virginia\u2019s schools would not \u201cteach our children to view everything through a lens of race.\u201d Education likely played a role in the election, though it wasn\u2019t the only issue on voters\u2019 minds. In exit polls, about one-quarter of Virginian voters said education was the most important issue facing the state, while about one-third said the economy was most important. Youngkin flipped Virginia Beach County, a place where a school board meeting over a mask mandate grew heated earlier this year. An effort is underway to recall six of the Virginia Beach City Public Schools board members. But Loudoun County, which trends blue and also drew national attention this year after one man was arrested at a board meeting on equity, went for Democrat Terry McAuliffe. The national Republican Party may look to Youngkin\u2019s campaign as a playbook for the congressional midterm elections next year, but it\u2019s unclear if school issues will remain at the forefront. School reopening policies and concern over race curriculums may have peaked. \u201cIt\u2019s a real open question about whether a year from now these are going to be the issues that turn people. I\u2019m skeptical,\u201d said Jeffrey Henig, a professor of political science and education at Columbia University.

Follow him @DeanObeidallah. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. View more opinion articles on CNN. On Saturday night, state Republican parties in North Carolina and Georgia took actions alarming to not just our democracy \u2013 but to our nation. The first and most dangerous was in North Carolina, where the state\u2019s GOP party welcomed Donald Trump to speak at its annual state convention. Before Saturday, Trump\u2019s only public speaking event since leaving office was at the Conservative Political Action Conference (CPAC) in February, but that group is not formally part of the Republican Party. The North Carolina speech was the first time a state Republican party publicly embraced Trump in this way. And it did so on the eve of the five-month anniversary of the January 6 attack on the Capitol, which FBI Director Christopher Wray testified in March was an act of \u201cdomestic terrorism.\u201d Surprising to no one, Trump repeated Saturday the very lies that incited the Jan 6 insurrection, including calling the 2020 election, \u201cthe crime of the century.\u201d He even added a new line that sounds like something coup leaders would say to defend their action, telling the audience, \u201cI am not the one who is trying to undermine American democracy, I am the one who is trying to save it.\u201d Trump radicalized Americans to believe his \u201cBig Lie\u201d that he was the real winner of the election \u2013 a claim that led his supporters to storm the Capitol to try to stop the certification of President Joe Biden\u2019s victory. We know this because the rioters told us that in real time during the attack, with comments captured on video mid-siege such as, \u201cOur president wants us here.\u201d And the indictments of members of the right-wing Oath Keepers arrested for their roles as alleged conspirators in the January 6 attack suggest they were there because they believed Trump had called them to Washington with his December 19 tweet about a \u201cbig protest\u201d on that was going to be \u201cwild.\u201d Democracy in America has been overthrown before Despite those facts, the North Carolina state GOP party invited Trump to be their headline speaker. Imagine what Republicans would have said if a Democratic president had engaged in the same conduct as Trump did after losing an election. All of it, from spewing non-stop lies to inciting an act of what the FBI sees as \u201cdomestic terrorism\u201d designed to overturn a lost election.  And then the Democratic party celebrated that ex-President just months after the attack. Any doubt the GOP leaders would denounce the Democrats as supporting terrorism? In Georgia, the GOP state convention also showcased their devout loyalty to Trump. First, GOP Gov. Brian Kemp was loudly booed by the crowd, presumably for refusing to help Trump illegally overturn Biden\u2019s win in the state. And then the GOP delegates voted to censure Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger, a fellow Republican, who in the aftermath of the 2020 election rebuffed Trump\u2019s efforts to help him \u201cfind\u201d votes to overturn the result. As reminder, there were three recounts in Georgia after the election that all confirmed Biden\u2019s win. After the third one, Raffensperger stated, \u201cGeorgians can now move forward knowing that their votes, and only their legal votes, were counted accurately, fairly, and reliably.\u201d But to the GOP base in Georgia \u2013 just as to those in Utah who booed Senator Mitt Romney for voting to impeach Trump \u2013 facts don\u2019t matter, the truth is only what Trump says it is. Thus, the GOP voted Saturday to censure Raffensperger for \u201cdereliction of his constitutional duty.\u201d  This is akin to Trump saying he wants to defend, not undermine, our democracy with his lies. The Georgia GOP formally condemned Raffensperger, who literally followed the Constitution, for \u201cdereliction\u201d of duty. Trump and his crazies aren't done with us The threat today\u2019s GOP poses to our nation, though, goes far beyond these latest two events. We are seeing a multi-faceted assault by the GOP on the very bedrock of our Republic. First, there\u2019s the GOP\u2019s war on voting access. Since January, at least 14 GOP-controlled states enacted 22 new laws between January 1 and May 2021 to make it more difficult to vote, according to the Brennan Center for Justice. Worse, in some cases, these laws in places such as Georgia make it easier to overturn an election after it has taken place. A proposed law in Texas would have had a similar effect had Democrats not blocked a vote on it last week. Then there\u2019s the GOP\u2019s efforts in various states to effectively criminalize peaceful protests after last summer\u2019s Black Lives Matter movement took to the streets. In Oklahoma, the law there even alarmingly grants criminal and civil immunity to motorists who injure or  kill protesters with their vehicles if the drivers believe they are fleeing a riot. Third, we have the GOP\u2019s war on academic freedom that bans schools from teaching about systemic racism \u2013 aka \u201cCritical race theory\u201d (CRT). As of late May, five GOP-controlled state legislatures had banned CRT or related topics and conservatives in nine other states are pushing for similar measures.  This is in essence a modern-day book burning by the GOP.  Today\u2019s GOP is now defined by its embrace and defense of Trump \u2013 who incited an act that became \u201cdomestic terrorism\u201d \u2013 to its war on voting, speech and freedom of thought. How can any patriotic American not see this version of the Republican party as a threat to who we are as a nation?",

The latest example came Thursday night, when Trump released a deeply irresponsible statement trying to reframe what happened on January 6 \u2013 in advance of another rally in Washington set for Saturday. \u201cOur hearts and minds are with the people being persecuted so unfairly relating to the January 6th protest concerning the Rigged Presidential Election,\u201d Trump said in a statement released by his Save America PAC on Thursday. \u201cIn addition to everything else, it has proven conclusively that we are a two-tiered system of justice. In the end, however, JUSTICE WILL PREVAIL!\u201d This is a classic bit of gaslighting by Trump. He\u2019s trying to make you believe that the way you remember the January 6 insurrection at the US Capitol isn\u2019t, actually, how it played out. In Trump\u2019s conception, these were peaceful protesters gathered to draw attention to the fact that the 2020 election was stolen. The \u201cJustice for J6\u201d rally on Saturday is simply a way to commemorate the wrongs committed against protesters that day. THE POINT -- NOW ON YOUTUBE! \nIn each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe! \u201cPeople are so disgusted with the way people are being treated from the Jan. 6 situation,\u201d Trump told The Federalist, a Trump-friendly publication, in an interview Thursday. \u201cIt\u2019s a combination of that compared to how Antifa and BLM were treated. When you compare the treatment, it is so unjust, it is so unfair. It\u2019s disgraceful.\u201d Of course, we all know the reality.  And it\u2019s this: A violent mob descended on Washington on January 6. After the president and other members of Congress spoke to the group, a chunk of them stormed the Capitol. Five people died. More than 100 police officers were injured. Almost 600 people have been charged by federal authorities for their actions that day. Thousands of people who live and work in or near the Capitol remain traumatized from the events of that day. We remember that. We know that it wasn\u2019t Antifa or Black Lives Matter protesters stoking the violence and bloodshed. We know that it was some of Trump\u2019s most ardent supporters, fueled by months of being lied to about the 2020 election. We know that Trump not only egged on the crowd at the original \u201cStop the Steal\u201d rally, but also refused to intervene on that day until long after it was clear that the situation had grown badly out of hand. That Trump is trying to re-frame what January 6 was \u2013 \u201cpeople being persecuted so unfairly relating to the January 6th protest concerning the Rigged Presidential Election\u201d \u2013 should surprise no one. This is who he is. This is what he does. That he would do so as a way to promote another protest of the election on Saturday speaks to the natural result of Republican leaders\u2019 unwillingness to confront the full scope of Trump\u2019s actions on January 6. Because so few Republican elected officials spoke out against what he did that day \u2013 as well as in the days leading up to it and the days after it \u2013 Trump has been further emboldened. And will continue to push boundaries and attempt to rewrite history. Because there simply aren\u2019t enough \u2013 or, really, hardly any \u2013 voices within the Republican Party who are willing to stand up and say \u201cENOUGH.\u201d Trump\u2019s gaslighting may work for his base. But the vast majority of the public knows the truth: January 6 was a dark day driven by people who lived in a fantasy world constructed for them by a dangerous president interested only in self-preservation. it\u2019s not a day to be celebrated, it\u2019s a day that should stand as a cautionary tale of what can happen when people are fed lies  \u2013 and choose to believe them unquestioningly.",

            "article_content": "The House Select Committee investigating the deadly January 6 riot has requested that a group of telecommunications companies preserve the phone records of a group of GOP members of Congress and former President Donald Trump, as well as members of the Trump family, who played some role in the \u201cStop the Steal\u201d rally that served as the prelude to the Capitol insurrection. The records request is the first step in the committee\u2019s investigatory process and could signal the direction they plan to go when they call witnesses. It is unclear what means the committee will use to compel the telecommunications companies to cooperate with their request. The committee does have subpoena power, but requesting the information \u2013 especially from members of Congress \u2013 could lead to a lengthy legal battle. The committee did not make public the names of the lawmakers whose records they are targeting. But multiple sources familiar with the committee\u2019s work have confirmed for CNN at least part of list including many of the members of Congress included in the request. According to the sources, this group was targeted because the committee concluded each of these lawmakers played some role in the \u201cStop the Steal\u201d rally. They either attended, spoke, actively planned or encouraged people to attend. The list is said to be evolving and could be added to as the investigation steps up. As of now it includes Republican Reps. Lauren Boebert of Colorado, Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, Jim Jordan of Ohio, Andy Biggs of Arizona, Paul Gosar also of Arizona, Mo Brooks of Alabama, Madison Cawthorn of North Carolina, Matt Gaetz of Florida, Louie Gohmert of Texas, Jody Hice of Georgia and Scott Perry of Pennsylvania. In addition to their connection to the rally, this group also represents some of former Trump\u2019s most loyal supporters in Congress, many of whom continue to peddle Trump\u2019s false claims about the 2020 election. Many of these members also voted to object to the election results on the day of the insurrection. A spokesperson for the Select Committee declined to comment on the lawmakers and members of Trump\u2019s family included in the preservation of records request list. Select Committee Chairman Bennie Thompson, a Mississippi Democrat, previously said publicly that the committee would be asking for the phone records of \u201cseveral hundred\u201d individuals. In addition to the members of Congress, CNN has learned the committee will also request the records of the former President be preserved, as well as his daughter Ivanka, his sons Donald Trump Jr. and Eric Trump, as well as his daughter-in-law Lara Trump and Kimberly Guilfoyle, who is Trump Jr.\u2019s girlfriend and worked on the campaign. The request for the preservation of phone records of certain lawmakers and members of the former President\u2019s orbit were part of a larger preservation request to 35 social media and telecommunication companies including Verizon Wireless, AT&T, T-Mobile, US Cellular and Sprint. The committee also made separate preservation requests to search engine and social media companies like Apple, Google, Facebook, Signal, Slack, YouTube, Twitch and Twitter. The committee is specifically asking companies preserve the records of individuals who could serve as links between those who were involved with organizing or planning the rallies around January 6 and violence committed the day of the insurrection. The committee is also specifically targeting individuals who have been charged by the Department of Justice or the District of Columbia for their affiliation with the attack and those who were attempting \u201cto challenge, delay, or interfere\u201d with the certification of the 2020 presidential election results. Acknowledging the wide net of preservation requests it has made, the committee wrote, \u201cAs the Select Committee continues its work, we anticipate delivering to you document requests for more specific categories of information.\u201d The committee also stated that the request did not assume wrongdoing on the part of those affected. In its request to Verizon for example, the select committee asks that the cell site location information, call data records and content, cloud or storage content and subscriber information be preserved. The committee also asked that if the company cannot respond to its request without alerting the specific subscriber or account in question to contact the committee directly. \u201cAs Chairman Thompson previewed last week, the Select Committee today sent letters to 35 private-sector entities, including telecommunications, email, and social media companies, instructing them to preserve records which may be relevant to the Select Committee\u2019s investigation. The Select Committee is at this point gathering facts, not alleging wrongdoing by any individual\u201d a spokesperson for the Committee said in a statement. While asking for the phone records of these individuals may not come as a surprise, there is one notable name not expected to be included in this group of requests. Sources say House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy\u2019s name was not included. McCarthy notably spoke to the former President during the height of the riot. The contents of that call are expected to be of great interest to the committee. Thompson has repeatedly not ruled out calling McCarthy to testify in front of the committee if that is where the investigation leads. That doesn\u2019t mean that committee will never request his records, they just are choosing not to at this stage of the investigation. CNN has reached out to the members of Congress on the list for a response, but Republicans have already reacted negatively to the prospect of the committee requesting this information. Brooks tweeted later Monday morning, \u201c\u2019#Socialists & \u2018Pelosi Republicans\u2019 (Cheney & Kinzinger) seek my phone records? Three results: 1 Total waste of taxpayer money. 2 Boredom for who looks at my records. 3 Russian Collusion Hoax 2.0. Why not subpoena Socialists who support BLM & ANTIFA?\u201d Greene said in a statement to CNN that the anticipated request is \u201call an attempt to smear us and remove us from office. Or even worse, put the strongest political enemies of the Democrats in jail.\u201d Rep. Jim Banks, whom McCarthy originally picked to serve as the ranking member on the committee but was turned away by House Speaker Nancy Pelosi, sent Thompson a letter on Friday, warning him against taking this step. \u201cRifling through the call logs of your colleagues would depart from more than 230 years of Congressional oversight,\u201d the Indiana Republican wrote. \u201cThis type of authoritarian undertaking has no place in the House of Representatives and the information you seek has no conceivable legislative purpose.\u201d Jordan, who is among those whose records the committee is requesting, last week warned that there could be political retribution. \u201cI have nothing to hide,\u201d he said, but added that \u201cif they cross this line,\u201d Republicans will keep asking questions about their Democratic colleagues.",

            "article_content": "Rep. Liz Cheney is outlining her next steps in the aftermath of her ousting from leadership, telling NBC, \u201cI intend to be the leader, one of the leaders, in a fight to help to restore our party,\u201d and warning that former President Donald Trump is willing \u201cto unravel the democracy to come back into power.\u201d The Wyoming congresswoman, and now former House Republican Conference chair, also didn\u2019t rule out a run for president in the \u201cToday\u201d interview that aired Thursday morning, but she did confirm she  will run for reelection for her US House seat next year. Cheney said \u201csilence is not an option\u201d when speaking out against Trump, and she said admonishments from her fellow Republicans to move forward are not possible because the damage that the former president is causing is \u201can ongoing threat.\u201d The daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney reiterated her assertion Wednesday that Trump cannot become president again. \u201cHe\u2019s unfit,\u201d she said. \u201cHe never again can be anywhere close to the Oval Office.\u201d \u201cFor reasons that I don\u2019t understand, leaders in my party have decided to embrace the former President who launched that attack,\u201d Cheney said. \u201cAnd I think you\u2019ve watched over the course of the last several months, the former President get more aggressive, more vocal, pushing the lie, and I think that\u2019s a really important thing for people to understand. This isn\u2019t about looking backwards. This is about the real-time current potential damage that he\u2019s doing, that he continues to do.\u201d She added, \u201cIt\u2019s an ongoing threat, so silence is not an option.\u201d Cheney lost her post in the House Republican leadership on Wednesday after publicly rejecting for months Trump\u2019s lie that he won the 2020 presidential election and calling out the former President for his role in inciting the January 6 deadly riot at the Capitol. The House GOP conference ousted Cheney by voice vote during a 16-minute meeting, and she\u2019s likely to be replaced by Republican Rep. Elise Stefanik of New York. The GOP just handed Liz Cheney a megaphone Cheney said she is \u201cvery focused on making sure that our party becomes again, a party that stands for truth, and stands for fundamental principles that are conservative. And mostly stands for the Constitution and I won\u2019t let the former President or anybody else unravel the democracy. Whatever it takes.\u201d She called the former President\u2019s hold on the party \u201cvery dangerous\u201d and \u201ca cult of personality.\u201d \u201cI think people were betrayed and misled by him,\u201d Cheney said. \u201cIt\u2019s a real betrayal. He\u2019s going to unravel the democracy to come back into power.\u201d As for Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy, Cheney said he is \u201cnot leading with principle right now\u201d and called a recent visit to Mar-a-Lago to see the former President \u201cstunning.\u201d She also placed blame at the feet of McCarthy, a California Republican, saying he is \u201cnot leading with principle, and I think that is sad and I think it\u2019s dangerous.\u201d Cheney pressed fellow Republicans to embrace a bipartisan January 6 commission to get to the truth of what happened on that day, and that \u201cthere should be no reason why there should be any resistance.   \u201cThere is real concern among a number of members of my own party about a January 6th commission, and I think, you know, I have been very public that that commission needs to be bipartisan. It needs to look only at January 6th and the events leading up to it. Not at the BLM and Antifa riots last summer. I think that intense, narrow focus threatens people in my party who may have been playing a role they should not have been playing,\u201d she said. \u201cEach time we have something happen in this country that is that kind of a crisis, we have a commission, and there is no reason why there should be any resistance to doing so in this case.\u201d When asked if she was now going to play the role of the opposition leader in exile in the Republican Party, Cheney said she intended to help restore her party, and \u201cin a fight to make sure that we won\u2019t participate in a real dangerous effort that\u2019s underway.\u201d But when pressed that she was now out of her leadership role, and that Trump seemed to be victorious in their recent skirmish and ascendant, Cheney quipped, \u201cActually, I\u2019m in office and he\u2019s out of office.\u201d CNN\u2019s Betsy Klein contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Wisconsin Republican Sen. Ron Johnson on Thursday invoked race in explaining his sense of safety during the January 6 Capitol riot, saying that he might have been concerned for his well-being had the protesters been affiliated with Black Lives Matter instead of being a largely White pro-Trump crowd. \u201cEven though those thousands of people that were marching to the Capitol were trying to pressure people like me to vote the way they wanted me to vote, I knew those were people that love this country, that truly respect law enforcement, would never do anything to break the law, and so I wasn\u2019t concerned,\u201d Johnson said during the radio talk show \u201cThe Joe Pags Show.\u201d He was discussing his recent comments downplaying the danger that day and he has said he \u201cnever really felt threatened.\u201d \u201cNow, had the tables been turned \u2013 Joe, this could get me in trouble \u2013 had the tables been turned, and President Trump won the election and those were tens of thousands of Black Lives Matter and Antifa protesters, I might have been a little concerned,\u201d Johnson continued. CNN has reached out to Johnson\u2019s office for comment. Some conservatives have sought to draw a false equivalency between the events of January 6 and the unrest that took place over the summer in the wake of several high-profile police killings of Black Americans. Although there were incidents of violence and property destruction last summer, the January riot at the Capitol resulted in five deaths, including a Capitol Police officer, and more than 100 other police officers were injured. The Justice Department is preparing some of the first guilty plea offers for people who were subsequently charged in the investigation, which has been called one of the \u201clargest in American history,\u201d with more than 400 possible defendants. Johnson has repeatedly made incendiary comments mischaracterizing the riots. Last month, Johnson said that he didn\u2019t believe that what had happened at the Capitol was an \u201carmed insurrection,\u201d despite court records indicating that supporters of then-President Donald Trump had brought dozens of weapons to Washington on the day of the insurrection, according to the Justice Department. Later in February, Johnson advanced the conspiracy theory that there had been professional provocateurs within the mob at the Capitol. The FBI has said there is no evidence that Antifa or any other groups of leftist instigators were part of the January 6 crowd \u2013 much less were the ones inciting violence \u2013 and nearly a dozen Trump supporters charged in connection with the insurrection have said that such groups weren\u2019t involved in the attack. Many of the people arrested identify with far-right groups like the Oath Keepers, not with any groups on the far left. CNN\u2019s Marshall Cohen, Zachary Cohen and Evan Perez contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "The \u201cPatriot Party\u201d is somewhere between a meme and a movement of Trump loyalists. The idea and, perhaps just as important, the logo, have been circulating on social media since last summer. But after the Capitol riot and swearing-in of President Joe Biden, Patriot Party groups have formed and multiplied, mostly on Telegram, where they share memes, disinformation and commentary in chaotic channels in all 50 states. Garland vows to prosecute White supremacists and others who attacked Capitol on January 6 Before it was removed from Facebook, one Patriot Party group had more than 12,000 members. One post that was removed read: \u201cWe need to organize our militia \u2026 Wars are won with guns.. an when they silence your commander in chief you are in a war.\u201d On February 6, one Patriot Party group held its first organized public rally in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, which was billed as an \u201cawareness march.\u201d Only about 30 people showed up, not much happened and it was over in a couple of hours. But at its conclusion, when CNN returned to the parking lot, some attendees had changed their clothes. At least eight were wearing Proud Boys hoodies. They were shouting that their cars had been vandalized. They would not explain the wardrobe change and were angry at the question. The energy and anger that fueled the Trump movement and the January 6 Capitol riot are still out there, swirling around, and it\u2019s not clear yet who\u2019s going to seize them and to what ends. At the moment, it appears the Patriot Party is becoming one vessel for that energy. But even those within it are not sure who their comrades are. Pennsylvania cop charged in Capitol riot: 'FBI may arrest me ..lol' The \u201cawareness march\u201d was organized by a man named Richard \u201cDick\u201d Schwetz. Schwetz, who often goes by Dick Sweats online and who indicated his name had posed a challenge for most of his life, has publicly, on video, said he\u2019s a Proud Boy. But as he waited in the parking lot for a bus full of women that was supposedly coming from Pittsburgh that never showed, Schwetz denied this event had anything to do with that group. \u201cThis isn\u2019t about the Proud Boys. It\u2019s about the Patriot Party,\u201d he said. Asked if the Patriot Party was putting a friendlier face, with a cute lion logo, on more violent actors, like militias or the Proud Boys, Schwetz said, \u201cStop. See that\u2019s where you guys go. You go too deep.\u201d 9 alleged Oath Keepers charged in conspiracy to attack Capitol CNN then pointed to the pile of merchandise visible in the back of Schwetz\u2019s car, which included hats with the Patriot Party logo in the Proud Boys\u2019 black-and-gold colors. Was that intended to look like the Proud Boys? Schwetz said, \u201cNo, I don\u2019t, I \u2013 I just had yellow vinyl. I\u2019m sorry. That\u2019s all I had left over.\u201d Schwetz told CNN that one reason for the rally was to \u201cset up official Patriot Party representatives.\u201d \u201cThe only way we could figure out to do that, since we\u2019re all deplatformed from every single social media outlet there is, is by meeting up in person and doing it the old-fashioned way. I got the pen and paper and everything,\u201d Schwetz said. It\u2019s hard to tell who\u2019s for real online, he admitted. \u201cIt\u2019s a digital world. It\u2019s unfortunate.\u201d In the last days of his presidency, Donald Trump floated the idea of starting a new party, CNN has reported. The Wall Street Journal reported he wanted to call it the Patriot Party. Trump campaign adviser Jason Miller then told CNN that Trump is not currently considering launching a third party. But some of his followers are trying to do it themselves. The Trump campaign had to file a notice with the Federal Election Commission that it had \u201cno affiliation\u201d with a Patriot Party that had claimed in its own filing to be working with Trump\u2019s campaign. There are multiple national Patriot Party Telegram channels and groups in every state. There are not clear leaders. Many followers say they\u2019ve been kicked off Facebook and Twitter, so they mostly organize on Telegram \u2013 where anyone can join under any name. There, people are sharing the same disinformation about the election, QAnon, Covid-19 and the riot itself that is often banned from other social media. CNN has spoken to several people in these channels who were at the Capitol on January 6. One person who was at the Capitol and also in Harrisburg was Andy Walker, a regular at \u201cStop the Steal\u201d events in Pennsylvania after the election. \u201cWe want our freedoms back. We want the constitutional way,\u201d Walker said. \u201cThe laws that \u2026 this nation was founded on \u2026 And there\u2019s the censorship, the banning. Everything\u2019s getting out of control.\u201d Walker said he wanted to get Patriot Party types elected to local government. Like other people at the rally, he said he believed the election had been stolen. It wasn\u2019t. Walker said he\u2019d marched to the Capitol on January 6, but he denied going inside the building. \u201cI\u2019d do it again,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat do they expect from us when we\u2019ve been suppressed and shut down and silenced?\u201d The Patriot Party supporters hung out for a bit on the state Capitol steps in Harrisburg. Two women came by to raise awareness about a lawsuit they thought would overturn the election results. Some made plans to meet at a restaurant later. A woman asked the CNN crew if the journalists liked the American flag. Then the rallygoers walked back to their cars, shouting, \u201cBye, CNN!\u201d We hung around talking to people for a few more minutes, then headed back to the parking lot, where we found a strange scene. The Patriot Party supporters were distraught. And some were wearing different clothes. At least eight were wearing Lehigh Valley Proud Boys hoodies, some with yellow bandannas. One was wearing a strikingly similar black-and-gold Patriot Party hoodie. They were shouting. They said \u201cdomestic terrorists\u201d had vandalized their cars \u2013 nails behind the tires, two flags stolen, spray paint on the windshield and windows of two vehicles, and one tire slashed. \u201cThis is the aftereffects of domestic terrorism against conservatives in this country, which has been happening forever!\u201d Schwetz said. When CNN pointed out that the Proud Boys were there, Schwetz said, \u201cI don\u2019t know, I never heard of them, never heard of those guys.\u201d In a video later posted to Telegram, Schwetz said, \u201cWe got our boys here.\u201d At least 16 people linked to the Proud Boys have been charged in connection with the Capitol riot, and 5 have been charged with conspiracy. Canada also designated the Proud Boys as a terrorist organization in February. No one would answer the question of why the Proud Boys had changed into their hoodies or why they\u2019d come in the first place. A woman shouted, \u201cLeave the Proud Boys alone!\u201d Walker, whose tire was slashed, became angry when CNN asked who he thought had done it. \u201cFirst of all I don\u2019t think anybody said anything about antifa. It\u2019s domestic terrorism, that\u2019s what it is. Nobody said anything about antifa. Nobody said anything about BLM,\u201d Walker said. When asked who he thought did it, Walker became enraged, shouting, \u201cI don\u2019t give a s***! Does it matter who it was? Nobody gives a s*** who the f*** it was! It happened! I don\u2019t give a s***!\u201d (In a video recorded minutes later in the same parking lot and then posted to the Patriot Party of PA Telegram channel, Schwetz did blame antifa, saying, \u201cWe came back earlier because of threats being made on telegram by antifa. \u2026 They came out and pretty much attacked us right away just assuming that because we\u2019re men and we\u2019re patriots that obviously we\u2019re the enemy.\u201d) \u201cWe weren\u2019t doing anything to anybody,\u201d a woman chimed in. Some other men shouted, though it was incomprehensible in our audio recording. When asked, repeatedly, how he reconciled the fact that he\u2019d said the event had nothing to do with the Proud Boys and yet there they were, Schwetz responded, \u201cI have asked you to be respectful about the fact that it was a Patriot Party event. You keep going back to something has nothing to do with that.\u201d Schwetz called the police. A Black police officer eyed the Confederate flag sticker on Walker\u2019s truck as he surveyed the damage.",

            "article_content": "Fresh off a surprisingly strong vote of support within the House Republican conference, Wyoming Rep. Liz Cheney sat for an interview with \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d anchor Chris Wallace in which she made clear that she has no plans of backing off her criticism of former President Donald Trump. It was an utterly remarkable interview, the clearest renunciation of the Trump years (and the legion of supporters he leaves behind) that we\u2019ve seen come out of the GOP since the 45th president\u2019s election loss in November. I went through the transcript and picked out the lines you need to see. They\u2019re below. 1. \u201cThe oath that I took to the Constitution compelled me to vote for impeachment and it doesn\u2019t bend to partisanship, it doesn\u2019t bend to political pressure. It\u2019s the most important oath that we take.\u201d This is Cheney\u2019s response to the fact that she was censured by the Wyoming Republican Party over the weekend \u2013 and there are calls for her to resign after her vote to impeach the President. Her calculation? The Constitution > Donald Trump. 2. \u201cI think, you know, that people in the party are mistaken. They believe that BLM and Antifa were behind what happened here at the Capitol. It\u2019s just simply not the case, not true and we\u2019re going to have a lot of work we have to do.\u201d In which Cheney directly rebuts one of the main false charges floating around about the January 6 Capitol riot \u2013 that it was actually organized and directed by forces of the left. Imagine if every Republican member of Congress was willing to be so forthright about this? 3. \u201cThe extent to which the president, President Trump, for months leading up to January 6 spread the notion that the election had been stolen or that the election was rigged was a lie and people need to understand that. We need to make sure that we as Republicans are the party of truth that we are being honest about what really did happen in 2020 so we actually have a chance to win in 2022 and win the White House back in 2024.\u201d So much this. Cheney\u2019s stance is born, at least in part, out of political practicality. You can\u2019t live in a fantasy world where the 2020 election was stolen and also credibly make the case to the public that you should be handed either the White House or control of Congress. Fantasies are not what governance is rooted in. 4. \u201cI think this vote and conference made very clear, we are the party of Lincoln, we are not the party of QAnon or anti-Semitism or Holocaust deniers, or white supremacy or conspiracy theories. That\u2019s not who we are.\u201d Truth is: You can\u2019t be both. And while Cheney realizes that, it\u2019s not at all clear to me that House Minority leader Kevin McCarthy (California) does. THE POINT -- NOW ON YOUTUBE! \nIn each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe! 5. \u201cPeople will want to know exactly what the president was doing. They want to know, for example, whether the tweet he sent out calling Vice President Pence a coward while the attack was underway, whether that tweet, for example, was a premeditated effort to provoke violence. There are a lot of questions that have to be answered and there will be many, many criminal investigations looking at every aspect of this and everyone who was involved, as there should be.\u201d Cheney here suggests that this week\u2019s impeachment trial of Trump is really only a first step in sussing out what role he played in inciting the violence of January 6. And that the myriad criminal investigations into what exactly happened on January 6 \u2013 and what Trump did before, during and after the riot \u2013 will come under considerable scrutiny. 6. \u201cWe have never seen that kind of an assault by a president of the United States on another branch of government and that can never happen again.\u201d Wallace gave Cheney the chance to back off her statement explaining why she was voting to impeach Trump. She did not do so. 7. \u201cWhat we already know does constitute the gravest violation of his oath of office by any president in the history of the country, and this is not something that we can simply look past or pretend didn\u2019t happen or try to move on. We\u2019ve got to make sure this never happens again.\u201d This is how Cheney answered Wallace\u2019s question about whether, if she was in the Senate, she would vote to convict and remove Trump. And it sounds like a \u201cyes\u201d to me. 8. \u201cSo it should not have gotten to the point that it did. I don\u2019t believe the Democrats have any business determining who from the Republicans sit on committees, but we should have dealt with it ourselves.\u201d Asked whether or not House Republicans should have dealt with Georgia Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene and her litany of offensive and intolerant statements in the past, Cheney offered this not-that-subtle criticism of McCarthy for, well, not doing anything. Remember that the only reason the full House voted to strip Greene of her committee assignments is because House Republicans failed to punish her in any way for her past anti-Semitic and Islamophobic comments. 9. \u201cSomebody who has provoked an attack on the United States Capitol to prevent the counting of electoral votes, which resulted in five people dying, who refused to stand up immediately when he was asked and stop the violence, that \u2013 that is a person who does not have a role as a leader of our party going forward.\u201d This is the most quoted line from Cheney\u2019s interview \u2013 and rightly so. In it, she makes clear that she believes the former president should have no role in the GOP going forward. Which is further than any other Republican elected official has gone \u2013 at least as far as I can tell. 10. \u201cWe have to make sure that we are able to convey to the American voters, we are the party of responsibility, we are the party of truth, that we actually can be trusted to handle the challenges this nation faces like Covid, and that\u2019s going to require us to focus on substance and policy and issues going forward but we should not be embracing the former president.\u201d This, to me, is the most important point Cheney makes. There\u2019s a reason Democrats now control all levers of power in political Washington. And the reason is Donald Trump \u2013 and the deeply irresponsible way in which he (and the Republican elected officials who enabled him) acted over the last five years. If you want voters to trust you with power, you have to show that a) your party is more than simply a cult of personality and b) that you will responsibly use that power to benefit the public. Republicans have demonstrated neither over the last four years. 11. \u201cYou know, it\u2019s really \u2013 it\u2019s heartbreaking in many ways, Chris, because, you know, we watched the inaugural speech where [President Joe Biden] spoke of unity, where he spoke of trying to work together in the immediate actions we\u2019ve seen with respect to, you know, things like canceling the Keystone pipeline, it\u2019s heartless. It really is.\u201d Democrats praising Cheney for her principled stands on Trump would do well to remember that she is no Democrat.

            "article_content": "A rookie Republican congresswoman from Georgia, Marjorie Taylor Greene, was suspended from Twitter on Sunday for 12 hours after she repeatedly tweeted election misinformation. Greene has a long history of embracing baseless conspiracy theories. And she has been a serial tweeter of false claims \u2013 about the election, the Capitol insurrection and other subjects \u2013 since she won her seat in November. Below is a fact check of 11 false claims Greene has tweeted in the last month alone, including three related claims about the integrity of the election. After CNN emailed her congressional office to offer her the opportunity to comment on any of these findings, her communications director, Nick Dyer, had only a brief response, \u201cHere\u2019s our comment: \u2018CNN is fake news.\u2019\u201d Defending President Donald Trump against accusations that he incited the Capitol insurrection, Greene argued: \u201cThe timeline doesn\u2019t fit the narrative. Trump supporters could not have listened to President Trump\u2019s speech at the WH and then been \u2018incited\u2019 by him to walk to and attack the Capitol.\u201d Facts First: This is just not true \u2013 even leaving aside the fact that insurrectionists near the Capitol could have listened to Trump\u2019s speech on their phones or could have been inspired by Trump\u2019s previous rhetoric. There was more than enough time for people to walk about a mile and a half from The Ellipse park, where Trump gave a speech that ended before 1:15 p.m. ET, to the Capitol, where rioters were still present more than three hours after Trump concluded. In fact, the FBI alleges that some insurrection participants did make this walk, including one who allegedly went from the Trump speech to her hotel and then into the Capitol. Abortion rights group NARAL Pro-Choice America tweeted the following about the insurrection: \u201cAnti-choice extremists, white supremacists, and violent misogynists all converged this week to attack our country. But the thing is, these groups already have a lot of overlap. What we saw was horrifying and devastating. But it wasn\u2019t surprising.\u201d Greene responded that the Capitol attack was \u201cterrible and shouldn\u2019t have happened\u201d \u2013 but then added that all of the people who died as a result of the insurrection were White, \u201cso I\u2019m not sure where your white supremacy bs is coming from.\u201d Facts First: According to the FBI, it is true, not \u201cbs,\u201d that White supremacists were involved in the insurrection. (Also, the fact that people killed at the Capitol were White obviously does not mean White supremacists could not have been among the perpetrators. Some of the people killed had been participants in the insurrection. And White supremacists sometimes kill other White people.) The FBI alleges that Bryan Betancur, who has been charged for alleged involvement in the insurrection, is \u201cis a self-professed White supremacist who has made statements to law enforcement officers that he is a member of several white supremacy organizations.\u201d The FBI alleges that a confidential source says that another man who has been charged, Timothy Louis Hale-Cusanelli, is \u201can avowed white supremacist and Nazi sympathizer.\u201d A third man who has been charged, Robert Keith Packer, is alleged to be the man seen at the insurrection wearing a \u201cCamp Auschwitz\u201d shirt. The FBI alleges the shirt \u201cappears to be a symbol of Nazi hate ideology.\u201d A fourth man who has been charged, Anthime Joseph (Tim) Gionet, is an Internet personality who is known for his role in the racist and anti-Semitic \u201calt-right\u201d movement and who attended the infamous White nationalist rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 2017. The charges against these men were announced after Greene\u2019s \u201cbs\u201d tweet, but nonetheless, there was never any basis to accuse NARAL of making up the claim that white supremacists were present at the Capitol. In addition, a variety of symbols used by white supremacists had been seen at the Capitol during the insurrection. The publication Insider has reported that Gionet has disputed the assertion that he is a white nationalist. Packer did not respond to CNN requests for comment before his arrest. Betancur and Hale-Cusanelli did not immediately have lawyers listed in an online federal system. Greene tweeted that \u201cthere was MASS voter fraud on a scale that should terrify every American regardless of political party.\u201d Facts First: This is, again, just false. There is no evidence of mass voter fraud \u2013 as Republican election officials around the country and Trump-appointed former Attorney General William Barr have acknowledged. Rather, there have been isolated instances of alleged fraud by lone voters, far too minor to have affected the outcome. In court, even Trump\u2019s own legal team often declined to allege mass fraud \u2013 focusing instead on complaints about law and process. But the Trump team lost case after case anyway. We\u2019ll address three related claims under this one heading. Greene repeatedly called the presidential election \u201cstolen.\u201d She repeatedly referred to some of President-elect Joe Biden\u2019s electoral votes as \u201cfraudulent.\u201d And she explicitly claimed that Biden \u201clost\u201d the election and Trump \u201cwon.\u201d Facts First: All three claims are false. Biden won the election, fairly and legally. There is no evidence to suggest otherwise. Trump\u2019s various claims about supposed fraud and supposed election-rigging have been rejected in court and debunked at length by officials and fact checkers. Greene criticized Gabriel Sterling, a senior official in the office of Georgia\u2019s top elections official, Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger. She tweeted, \u201cYou ran a Nov 3rd election that was stolen bc you idiots at the SOS mailed out millions of absentee ballots to any one and everyone while GA was an open state.\u201d Facts First: Georgia\u2019s presidential election was not \u201cstolen.\u201d Biden won the state fair and square, as confirmed by three counts of the ballots and an audit of some voters\u2019 signatures. Georgia was not one of the states to send an absentee ballot to every eligible registered voter; a ballot was only sent to an eligible voter who requested one. Georgia does not require any excuse to vote absentee, but this no-excuse policy was created by state Republican leaders in 2005, not by Raffensperger himself. Greene tweeted: \u201c\u2026 Georgia state leaders refused to listen to Georgia tax payers. They refused to change anything after allowing @realDonaldTrump\u2019s election to be stolen. And they refused to #StopTheSteaI with our two senate seats.\u201d Facts First: There was no \u201csteal\u201d of Georgia\u2019s two Senate seats; Democrats Jon Ossoff and Raphael Warnock won fair and square in the January runoff elections. Their Republican opponents, David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler, have both conceded defeat. Greene tweeted, \u201c202,377 more votes cast than voters voting in Pennsylvania! This is called election fraud.\u201d Facts First: False again. State officials and fact checkers have repeatedly explained that the claim that Pennsylvania had more votes than registered voters is just not true; Greene was invoking an incorrect figure from a Republican state legislator who had relied on incomplete data. The day after Twitter banned Trump\u2019s @realDonaldTrump account, Greene tweeted, \u201cYesterday they crushed the First Amendment. You can see what\u2019s coming next. I vow to do everything I can to protect American\u2019s Second Amendment rights.\u201d Facts First: Nobody crushed the First Amendment on January 8. Greene didn\u2019t explicitly say she was talking about Twitter\u2019s decision to suspend Trump\u2019s account, but if she was, she was clearly inaccurate. The First Amendment prohibits the government from silencing citizens, but it does not require corporations, including social media companies like Twitter, to allow citizens to speak freely. Greene tweeted, \u201cZERO Democrats have condemned the political violence of BLM/Antifa terrorists that lasted the entirety of 2020. Instead, each of them fanned the flames of hate.\u201d Facts First: Numerous Democrats \u2013 including Biden, House Speaker Nancy Pelosi and senior members of the party\u2019s congressional caucus \u2013 condemned rioting and looting last year while also supporting peaceful Black Lives Matter protests against racism and police brutality. Republicans are entitled to argue that Democrats should have issued such condemnations more forcefully or frequently, or that they should have been more explicit in identifying the perpetrators, but it\u2019s just inaccurate to say or suggest they didn\u2019t issue the condemnations at all.",

            "article_content": "Appointed Republican Sen. Kelly Loeffler\u2019s loss at the hands of Rev. Raphael Warnock (D) on Tuesday brings to an end one of the most ignominious Senate terms in modern memory. Yes, there have been shorter tenures. (Georgia Democratic Sen. Rebecca Latimer Felton served for only a single day!) And, yes, plenty of other appointed senators have lost when they ran for election in their own right. (Like Arizona\u2019s Martha McSally, who lost in November.) But few \u2013 if any \u2013 appointed senators have so tarnished their personal reputation as Loeffler did in the year she spent in the world\u2019s greatest deliberative body. Consider Loeffler\u2019s reputation when Gov. Brian Kemp appointed her to the seat vacated by Sen. Johnny Isakson (R) in late 2019: A prominent (and wealthy) businesswoman and a moderate Republican who Kemp clearly hoped would bolster his own political standing in the critical Atlanta suburbs heading into his 2022 reelection race. In her earliest days in the Senate, Loeffler tried to position herself as just that: A successful businesswoman bringing some much-needed outsider perspective to Washington. In an ad she ran soon after being appointed, Loeffler touted her mantra \u201chard work and results really matter.\u201d That plan appeared to go out the window in the spring of 2020, when Loeffler (and her husband) found themselves in the middle of a massive controversy regarding a series of stock sales just before the coronavirus pandemic shut down the American economy. As CNN wrote at the time: \u201cLoeffler and her husband sold 27 stocks between January 24 and February 14 at a value of $1.28 million and $3.1 million, according to Senate financial disclosure records. They also purchased three stocks for between $450,000 to $1 million, including shares in Citrix, a software company used for teleconferencing that\u2019s one of the few that\u2019s gained value amid the coronavirus outbreak. Citrix\u2019s stock was $122.03 on February 14, the day it was purchased, and closed at $125.31 on Thursday.\u201d Amid questions of whether her position in the Senate gave her advance notice of the coming catastrophe, Loeffler told Fox News at the time that she was \u201cnot involved in the decisions around buying and selling\u201d of her stocks. While she continued to insist that she had done nothing wrong, Loeffler announced in April that she and her husband were selling off all of their individual stocks. That episode seemed to mark a clear turning point in how Loeffler positioned herself politically. As questions were raised about the stock trades, Loeffler turned to accusations of socialism, of all things, to defend herself. This comes from a Fox News interview in mid-April: \u201cThis was a political attack designed to take away from the issue at hand. And to use this outbreak to play politics. We have addressed this and taken extraordinary measures to make sure that we can\u2019t be attacked for our success. This gets at the very heart of why I came to Washington, to defend free enterprise, to defend capitalism. This is a socialist attack.\u201d Uh, what? THE POINT -- NOW ON YOUTUBE! \nIn each episode of his weekly YouTube show, Chris Cillizza will delve a little deeper into the surreal world of politics. Click to subscribe! It only went downhill from there, as Loeffler tacked hard to the Trump right seeking to fend off Rep. Doug Collins, who jumped into the special election race in early 2020. (Collins was President Donald Trump\u2019s preferred pick to replace Isakson but Kemp went with Loeffler for the political reasons I mentioned above.) To wit: * Loeffler was quoted as saying there were \u201cno\u201d issues on which she and Trump disagreed. Asked whether that included Trump\u2019s misogynistic comments about women captured on an \u201cAccess Hollywood\u201d tape, she said: \u201cI\u2019m not familiar with that.\u201d Ha! * Loeffler ran a much-mocked TV ad in which she claimed to be \u201cmore conservative than Attila the Hun.\u201d (Yes, this really happened.) * Loeffler, a co-owner of the WNBA\u2019s Atlanta Dream, loudly objected to the league\u2019s decision to honor the \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d movement. \u201c@WNBA  should stand for and unite around the American Flag \u2014 not divisive political movements like BLM that unapologetically seek to defund the police,\u201d she tweeted. In response, the Dream team (ahem) sported \u201cVote Warnock\u201d T-shirts before games in support of Loeffler\u2019s opponent (and the now senator-elect). All in all, Loeffler not only ran a remarkably bad campaign, but she also seemed to abandon the entire reason she was chosen in the first place. A moderate Atlanta businesswoman ran like a Trump conservative \u2013 and lost. Stuart Stevens, a longtime Republican political consultant and a never-Trumper, put it best and bluntly. \u201cAs someone who in past years has had to listen to major donor Kelly Loeffler going off on how the Republican party was way too conservative, it\u2019s hard to express the depth of her nothingness,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cShe makes Martha McSally look like Margaret Thatcher.\u201d",

The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely her own. View more opinion articles on CNN. The House Select Committee investigating the January 6 insurrection is trying to figure out what role, if any, lawmakers played in the events of that day. Did members of the House, and other Republican lawmakers, as well as Donald Trump campaign workers, family members and affiliates, play any part in organizing the rally that quickly turned into a riot? Did people in elected office, who swore an oath to protect and defend the United States, have a hand in encouraging people who sought its overthrow? The House Select Committee that is probing, among other things, efforts by the former President to overturn the results of the 2020 election, has asked a handful of telecommunications companies to preserve the phone records of a number of Republican politicians, as well as those of some members of the Trump family. And Republicans are expressing outrage\u2014 with House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy going so far as to issue an apparently veiled threat. \u201cIf these companies comply with the Democrat order to turn over private information, they are in violation of federal law and subject to losing their ability to operate in the United States,\u201d Rep. Kevin McCarthy said in a statement he posted to Twitter Tuesday. \u201cIf companies still choose to violate federal law, a Republican majority will not forget and will stand with Americans to hold them fully accountable under the law.\u201d He did not respond to CNN\u2019s query as to what federal law these companies would be violating. But McCarthy\u2019s message seems clear enough: He\u2019s willing to do whatever it takes to prevent this investigatory body from actually conducting a thorough investigation and learning the full truth of what happened on Jan. 6. Other Republicans deflected and cast blame at the usual bogeymen \u2014 anyone but themselves. \u201c#Socialists & \u2018Pelosi Republicans\u2019 (Cheney & Kinzinger) seek my phone records?\u201d Rep. Mo Brooks tweeted on Monday, mentioning Republican Reps. Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger, who are among the select committee members seeking phone records. Brooks continued: \u201cThree results: 1 Total waste of taxpayer money. 2 Boredom for who looks at my records. 3 Russian Collusion Hoax 2.0. Why not subpoena Socialists who support BLM & ANTIFA?\u201d For one thing, \u201cSocialists who support BLM and ANTIFA\u201d didn\u2019t attack the Capitol and attempt to overthrow the government. If they did, one would imagine that many Republicans would support a thorough investigation, including a look into potential ties between insurrectionists and elected officials. The narrative of America in retreat is false After all, the Republican Party has a long history of supporting intrusions into personal privacy in the name of fighting terrorism and attacks on America. The GOP broadly supported the National Security Agency\u2019s mass surveillance of Americans\u2019 phone and text records, with a loud faction of the party standing in opposition to it only during Barack Obama\u2019s presidency. Even with Obama in office, Republicans blocked legislation that would have limited the NSA\u2019s reach by requiring the agency to go to court and request a specific set of phone records, instead of allowing it broad surveillance power over phone communications. For nearly two decades, many Republicans \u2013 and some Democrats \u2013 have been more than happy to allow a shadowy agency nearly unlimited power to spy on the communications of Americans. They justified it with appeals to national security and concerns about terrorism. But now that the national security threat comes from the GOP\u2019s own supporters \u2013 and from their party\u2019s figurehead \u2013 they would like to be protected by guardrails. (\u201cThe Select Committee is at this point gathering facts, not alleging wrongdoing by any individual,\u201d a select committee spokesman said Monday.) To be clear, the House Select Committee isn\u2019t asking for secretive surveillance, as Republicans and some Democrats did in the years after September 11, 2001; they\u2019re playing by the old rule book, and simply asking that records be preserved, which is not an unusual request for a telecommunications company to receive \u2013 and one that is, in this instance, directly relevant to the question of what role Republican lawmakers may have played in the January 6 insurrection. Republicans know this, but they\u2019re moving the goal posts. \u201cRifling through the call logs of your colleagues would depart from more than 230 years of Congressional oversight,\u201d Indiana Rep. Jim Banks wrote in a letter to Select Committee Chairman Bennie Thompson. \u201cThis type of authoritarian undertaking has no place in the House of Representatives and the information you seek has no conceivable legislative purpose.\u201d Banks and his colleagues seem far less concerned about the will toward authoritarianism required to overthrow a free and fair election. And note that when it came to the authoritarian policing tactics that last summer\u2019s Black Lives Matter protesters confronted, most of the GOP was silent \u2013 or flat-out hostile. But that is increasingly how this Republican Party operates: one loose and shifting set of rules for them, and a harsher and stricter set for everyone else.  Gathering call logs is basic fact-finding, which is the purpose of the Select Committee. But basic fact-finding is exactly what many Republicans appear to want to prevent. Despite witnessing up-close an attempt to violently overthrow the government, which included armed rioters hopped up on right-wing lies about voter fraud storming the Capitol building and trashing the place, the GOP overwhelmingly voted against forming the January 6 committee in the first place. This GOP doesn\u2019t really object to authoritarianism or violations of privacy; it objects to any effort to determine whether any among them engaged in traitorous acts. Why might that be? This article has been updated to include news of the statement posted on Twitter by Rep. Kevin McCarthy.",

View more opinion on CNN. When Congressman Mo Brooks attended Donald Trump\u2019s \u201cSave America Rally\u201d at the Ellipse Wednesday, January 6 \u2013  the day Trump loyalists attacked the US Capitol and tried to overturn the 2020 election \u2013 the Alabama Republican\u2019s big punchline was, \u201cToday is the day American patriots start taking down names and kicking ass.\u201d Faced, now, with a lawsuit alleging that he incited the violence that ensued, Brooks claimed he never advocated for violence. And he has said that his comment about \u201ckicking ass\u201d was about the 2022 and 2024 elections. But now, thanks to Brooks\u2019 own revelation, made to Slate writer Jim Newell this week, that he wore body armor that day, we know that like so many other Trumpists, he was ready for a rumble. \u201cI was warned on Monday that there might be risks associated with the next few days,\u201d Brooks told Newell. \u201cAnd as a consequence of those warnings, I did not go to my condo. Instead, I slept on the floor of my office. And when I gave my speech at the Ellipse, I was wearing body armor.\u201d After Newell\u2019s report, Brooks\u2019 office told a local Alabama station that he had \u201czero warnings of any kind\u201d about Trump supporters posing a risk on January 6 and that he wore armor because he was warned of a \u201crisk of threatened violence by BLM & ANTIFA\u201d and that he took it seriously because he had been shot at before. But it seems like Brooks, realizing that he may have made things worse for himself, might just be walking back the comments he made to Newell. After all, blaming Black Lives Matter and ANTIFA is a routinely used tactic of many on the right. The telling bit of news about the tough-talking Brooks, and the attackers Capitol officers described during their testimony this week before the House select committee investigating the riot, in many ways is a mass embodiment of the ugly values Trump himself had long validated for his supporters. The bigotry Trump had modeled for years, for example, spewed from the mouth of a woman, in a pink \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d shirt, who led a crowd that screamed racist epithets at Black Capitol Police Officer Harry Dunn, Dunn recalled at the hearing. The violence that Trump had regularly toyed with at his rallies became manifest as DC Metropolitan Police Officer Michael Fanone was beaten by attackers who called him a \u201ctraitor.\u201d The degrading way Trump has spoken about many people seemed to be channeled by an attacker who DC Metropolitan Police Officer Daniel Hodges said taunted him with the words, \u201cYou will die on your knees.\u201d It was riveting, disturbing, emotional Like Trump, members of the mob claimed to be pro-police, even as they fought officers hand-to-hand. Like Trump, they talked of treason, though some rallied around the battle flag of the traitorous Confederacy.  This was the moment that experts had warned  might come, when Trump\u2019s followers expressed all the rage, cruelty and aggression he had normalized though his lifelong effort to sell himself as the ideal American man of action. Attackers dressed in combat gear represented Trump\u2019s militaristic leanings, which he had expressed most vividly by requiring that the military display its hardware at his 2019 July 4th celebration. The countless Trump flags waved by the mob recalled his longtime branding strategy of putting his name, in huge letters, everywhere he can. Finally, there was the nonsense slogan \u2013\u201cStop the Steal!\u201d \u2013 that aped the former president\u2019s blunt catchphrase style in both meter and tone. As described at the House hearing and revealed in many videos, the riot was the product of Trump\u2019s recent incitements, including false claims about election fraud and the pre-riot speech in which he told thousands of followers to go immediately to the Capitol to express their outrage. However, the process that led to January 6 began decades ago, as Donald Trump sold himself to the country as a crude, tough guy who spoke \u201cpolitically incorrect\u201d truths. Much of Trump\u2019s schtick back then involved talking about the world in apocalyptic terms and describing politicians as feckless weaklings. In 1987, he lashed officials who he said let other countries humiliate the US in trade agreements.  In 1989, he said the country was enduring \u201cthe complete breakdown of life as we knew it.\u201d In 1990, he would express admiration for China\u2019s violent crackdown on protesters because the government demonstrated \u201cthe power of strength.\u201d Throughout his life Trump also modeled cruelty and aggression, especially in statements about women. In one smarmy exchange he told a contestant on his TV show, \u201cMust be a pretty picture, you dropping to your knees.\u201d A political movement is coming of age at the Tokyo Games During his 2016 campaign, Trump frequently encouraged his supporters to get tough with protesters and even promised to pay the legal bills for anyone arrested for assaulting them. Trump made a thinly-veiled threat of gun violence, saying \u201cSecond Amendment people\u201d would act against Hillary Clinton. As Politico reported at the time, cries of \u201cKill her, kill her!\u201d and \u201ctake the b***h down\u201d could be heard at Trump events. During his presidency, Donald Trump continued to use violent words to connect with his supporters and rally them against his opponents or critics. He called journalists the \u201cenemy of the people\u201d and praised the actions of a Republican congressman who physically assaulted a reporter. Trump\u2019s rhetoric surely contributed to the hostility, threats and physical attacks his backers directed at journalists. Trump\u2019s aggression was blended with inflammatory statements related to race. Sources told CNN in 2018 that during a meeting, then-President Trump described Black majority nations as \u201cshithole countries.\u201d Trump denied the claims. Something that he couldn\u2019t easily deny was his very public tweet suggesting that Congresswomen Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez of New York, Rashida Tlaib of Michigan, Ilhan Omar of Minnesota and Ayanna Pressley of Massachusetts should \u201cgo back and help fix the totally broken and crime infested places from which they came.\u201d Three of the four women of color were born in the US, and one has been a naturalized citizen since 2000. He railed against Black athletes who protested police violence and called Covid-19 \u201ckung flu.\u201d Is it any wonder, after the years he invested in building up his anti-social, bad boy image and after a political career spent winding up his supporters into an emotional frenzy, that Trumpism produced January 6?  All the evidence that it did was displayed as the Capitol attackers gave free rein to the dark impulses that Trump had cultivated. They became, like him, men and women of aggression and action, certain they were right and intolerant of those who disagreed.  The result was what the officers told the committee. \u201cI was grabbed, beaten, tased, all while being called a traitor to my country,\u201d said Officer Fanone. Sergeant Aquilino Gonell heard shouts of \u201ctraitor\u201d and was told he deserved to be \u201cexecuted.\u201d Officer Dunn was met with racism of the kind he had never encountered while on duty at the Capitol. No doubt could be attached to the connection between these events and Trump. \u201cAll of them \u2013 all of them \u2013 were saying, \u2018Trump sent us,\u2019\u201d Gonell said. \u201cNobody else.\u201d With his call for ass-kicking, Rep. Mo Brooks may as well have been Trump himself. In the rioters\u2019 violence and bigotry, the attackers at the Capitol showed the officers that they had absorbed Trump\u2019s message so well they too expressed the essence of Trump.  In their snarling, violence they embodied what he has represented.  And once again Trump got what he seemed to want: It was all about him.",

On Tuesday, three of the Capitol police\u2019s former top leaders and the acting chief of the Washington, DC police testified before the Senate about the cascading law enforcement failures that occurred on January 6 as rioters stormed the Capitol complex. There was no shortage of finger-pointing and blame-passing, but one big takeaway was clear: We\u2019ve barely scratched the surface of what happened on one of the most ignominious days in American history. Republicans have tried to cast the January 6 attacks as an unfortunate incident, a moment when emotions ran high, many otherwise decent people were swept up in the fervor and things simply got out of hand. Rep. Kevin McCarthy argued that \u201ceverybody across the country has some responsibility\u201d for the deadly violence on January 6. Several House Republicans blamed Nancy Pelosi. Others equated an attack on the Capitol done in the name of the former president with sporadic violence and property destruction during Black Lives Matter protests. When Democrats tried to hold Donald Trump accountable in impeachment hearings, Republican Sen. Mike Lee opined that \u201ceveryone makes mistakes, everyone is entitled to a mulligan once in a while.\u201d Many rioters and their friends and family have made this same defense in court: That they were simply very passionate, if very stupid. But stupid people caught in the heat of the moment don\u2019t typically find that Tasers and zip ties materialize in their hands out of thin air. Ex-Capitol police chief contradicts GOP senator \u201cThese criminals came prepared for war,\u201d said former Capitol Police Chief Steven A. Sund, testifying that he believes the violence was preplanned and well organized. Testifying along with him were former Senate sergeant-at-arms Michael C. Stenger and former House sergeant-at-arms Paul D. Irving. Sund and other law enforcement officials noted that the rioters seemed to have a basic understanding of how they could strike when law enforcement was at their thinnest, that they came equipped with items that one would not expect to find at a peaceful protest == bear mace, climbing equipment, tactical gear \u2013 and that the attackers appeared to use coordinated hand gestures to communicate. Two explosives, Sund said, had been placed near the Capitol perimeter, and he believes those may have been intentional distractions to divert law enforcement attention away from the Capitol building as rioters attempted to sack it. As they contended with insurrectionists shroud in military paraphernalia, many Capitol police officers lacked riot gear and had no training on how to respond to a horde storming the Capitol. How I felt seeing guys like me at the Capitol riot All three men denied having seen an FBI report issued the day before the attack that warned extremists were traveling to Washington in pursuit of \u201cwar,\u201d and that the extremists had shared maps of the Capitol complex\u2019s tunnel system. According to the report, one social media thread said, \u201cBe ready to fight. Congress needs to hear glass breaking, doors being kicked in, and blood from their BLM and Pantifa slave soldiers being spilled. Get violent. Stop calling this a march, or rally, or a protest. Go there ready for war. We get our President or we die. NOTHING else will achieve this goal.\u201d Acting Metropolitan Police Chief Robert Contee said another compounding problem was that the Defense Department hesitated in deploying the National Guard. He was \u201cstunned,\u201d Contee said, at the foot-dragging. The men disagreed with each other on the timeline of requesting National Guard intervention, and who asked for what when, but it\u2019s clear that the guard was deployed far too late. Also clear: Rank-and-file officers are the ones who still bear the scars of these failures. Capt. Carneysha Mendoza of the Capitol Police testified that she was gassed with what she believes to be military-grade tear gas that was \u201cmixed with fire extinguisher spray deployed by the rioters.\u201d Rioters nearly broke her arm, and she sustained chemical burns to the face which still have not healed. These are the key moments from the US Capitol riot Capt. Mendoza is sadly representative of so many officers caught in the crosshairs that day: According to the police union, some 140 officers were injured and graphic body camera footage shows officers being beaten and crushed by heaving hordes of rioters as they scream for help. Two officers who were at the Capitol that day have since died by suicide. The failures clearly started at the top, with a federal government that did not want to take these threats seriously because they came from supporters of the president who were responding to his encouragement and his lies about widespread election fraud. To hear these four men tell it, they were left unprepared and in the dark \u2013 which is not an excuse coming from the Capitol\u2019s top law enforcement brass, but certainly raises questions about who else contributed to this deadly ignorance.  And the lack of communication and dearth of understanding of the scale of the threat is truly shocking, given that reporters, researchers of the far right and average folks online were sounding the alarm about the potential for violence at the January 6 event well before it happened. Tuesday\u2019s testimony was disturbing and enlightening. No huge new bombshells were dropped, but the contours of the story were sharpened. And what\u2019s coming into focus includes and goes well beyond law enforcement failures and calls into question decisions made by our country\u2019s top security and defense agencies, and our most powerful leaders.",

View more opinion articles on CNN. Wednesday\u2019s violent insurrection at the Capitol building in Washington, DC \u2013 as horrifyingly unprecedented as it was \u2013 also had a quality that we\u2019ve experienced repeatedly over the past four years: It was both shocking and surreal, and yet eerily familiar and entirely predictable. The scenes playing out at the Capitol echoed those that took place in Charlottesville in August of 2017, which I witnessed in-person and later reported on, following a known pattern of right-wing political unrest that has been nurtured by the President and his party. The parallels between the assaults on Charlottesville and the Capitol were striking: the hesitance of law enforcement to engage White, right-wing protesters (and their delay in doing so), the turn in right-wing media to the bogeyman of antifa as the source of disorder, the President\u2019s efforts to excuse or embrace the violence of his supporters \u2013 even as he urged them to go home, he said \u201cWe love you\u201d (in a video later restricted by social media platforms for its obfuscation and reinforcement of debunked election lies). But more than that, they were both marked by a pernicious both-sides-ism that has, over the past four years, corrupted every discussion of the violence and chaos that Donald Trump provokes, one encapsulated in the \u201cvery fine people on both sides\u201d line but with a much longer history in America. A few days after the violence in Charlottesville, Civil War historian Elizabeth Varon wrote about the false equivalence that for decades dominated the way most Americans talked about the Civil War: as a war in which both sides fought nobly on behalf of causes they deeply believed in, and at the end, laid down their arms and came back together as Americans. There were heroes on both sides, men on horseback deserving statues no matter how many people they enslaved or US soldiers they killed or insurrections they led. A Confederate flag at the Capitol summons America's demons It was a peace bought on the backs not only of the US soldiers who died but the millions of freed people forced into a system of segregation, theft and violence that persisted for nearly a century after the war. Trump trotted out the same sort of false equivalence after the violence in Charlottesville. He praised enslaver and Confederate traitor Robert E. Lee, who he has repeatedly called a \u201cgreat general.\u201d  He insisted that the people who flocked to Charlottesville for an event organized by violent neo-Nazis, Klan members and racists were very fine people who were just there to protect Lee\u2019s statue, even though the night before the planned rally, they had marched on the grounds of the University of Virginia and attacked anti-fascist and anti-racist protesters there. And he turned antifa \u2014 anti-fascist organizers and protesters \u2014 into the right\u2019s new scapegoat. We\u2019ve seen over the past year how useful that scapegoat has been for a new era of false equivalence. \u201cBut what about antifa?\u201d has been the response to nearly every act of right-wing violence since. Even more insidiously, the President and his supporters, from right-wing media personalities to members of Congress to posters on Facebook, have routinely suggested that in cases of violence, shadowy antifa were the actual cause. This is what it looks like when toxic White privilege is left unchecked That was clear on the Rush Limbaugh radio show on Wednesday, which was live as the seditious attack on the Capitol was underway. Despite the fact there was no visible contention of counter-protesters, when guest host Todd Herman first announced the news, he immediately speculated, with no evidence, that antifa was responsible. \u201cApparently there\u2019s talk that Trump supporters are breaching security on Capitol Hill,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s probably not Trump supporters who would do that. Antifa, BLM, that\u2019s what they do.\u201d He raised the idea of antifa stoking the violence again later in the show. The notion of antifa infiltration has already been thoroughly debunked. While there has been no verified anti-fascist presence in the Capitol, many pro-Trump activists have been identified after bragging about their participation on social media. Even without evidence, the antifa conspiracy continues to course through right-wing media, including on shows like Laura Ingraham\u2019s on Fox News. It does so because it serves a useful purpose, deflecting blame from groups associated with right-wing politics to a decentralized, often-little-understood group like antifa. Antifa-as-bogeyman persists, in part, because of the climate of false equivalency the President has deliberately stoked. Rather than acknowledge and denounce the right-wing violence and rising domestic terror threat that plagues the United States \u2014 the Department of Homeland Security has called it the most persistent and lethal terror threat in the country \u2014 the loudest pundits and politicians affect an air of high-mindedness to say violence is never the answer, a comforting platitude that no doubt has many readers nodding along. Inciting terrorism is a crime But the number of actual pacifists in the US is quite small, and the number among the ranks of politicians, pundits and Trump supporters is even smaller. Violence from the police, from the military, from those acting in self-defense \u2014 these have broad social sanction in our society. The real dividing line is not about violence or nonviolence but when we think violence is appropriate, and who we believe should be allowed to use it. Piercing that platitude, that \u201cviolence is never the answer,\u201d is important because it exposes its underlying purpose: to make two unequal things equal. Violent street gangs fighting for White supremacy are different than protesters fighting to stop them. Most Americans understand that in the framework of World War II: both the Allies and the Axis fought catastrophic battles, but some fought on behalf of the Nazi regime and some fought to stop it. Yet when similar fights break out on American streets, too many people forget that moral distinction. The same effort to equate unequal things was happening on the floor of the Senate before it was interrupted by insurrection. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, slipping into his somber statesman tone, denounced not just the coordinated attempt by Republicans to overturn the results of the election but also the Democrats\u2019 protest in 2004: \u201cRepublicans condemned those baseless efforts back then, and we just spent four years condemning Democrats\u2019 shameful attacks on the validity of President Trump\u2019s own election.\u201d But, of course, Democrats concerned about balloting in Ohio in 2004 were not looking to overturn the election. They had accepted that George W. Bush would remain president and acknowledged his victory. They were not working in league with a president, spreading falsehoods and conspiracies in an effort to maintain power in an increasingly unlawful effort to overturn the election and destroy Americans\u2019 faith in democracy.  Let\u2019s say, for the sake of argument, that Democrats\u2019 actions in 2004 were wrong. Even then, they were not equivalent to what is happening today, nor were they the entering wedge for the post-election chaos we have endured for the last two months. It has become popular, especially but not exclusively on the right, to point to moments like this and tut-tut over small infractions from an earlier era. But this sort of broken-windows policing of political discourse doesn\u2019t safeguard democracy. Pretending a litterbug and a spree killer have committed equivalent infractions doesn\u2019t make people safer. At best it confuses things; at worst, it excuses them. If we are to have any hope of building a just, working democracy in this country after Trump leaves (or is removed from) office, then we cannot continue to engage in debates set in these terms. Nor is our work done when we call out false equivalence (a popular Twitter pastime). Rather, we have to refocus our political debates and conversation around a different kind of discussion of ethics, one that can look at a Civil War battlefield or the streets of Charlottesville or the floor of the US Senate and see that there are fights that are righteous and there are fights that are not \u2013 and begin to build from there.",
