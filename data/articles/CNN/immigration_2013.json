            "article_content": "Midterm elections loom over President Obama and Congress Despite a budget compromise, spending battles will continue Republicans will make Obamacare a major campaign issue NSA surveillance, immigration reform and Middle East talks will be prominent For President Barack Obama and Congress, 2014 will be the year of the blame game. Congressional elections in November mean that every issue gets framed by politicians and pundits in the context of who won or lost as Republicans and Democrats vie for control of the U.S. House and Senate. The challenge will be in distinguishing reality from spin as events both anticipated and unexpected unfold at home and abroad. Obama heads into the sixth year of his presidency with a growing economy and momentum toward winding down the longest American war, which would normally translate into broad public support. However, the nation\u2019s first African-American president has the lowest poll numbers since he took office in 2009, reflecting public dissatisfaction over the botched Obamacare rollout, classified revelations of the huge government surveillance network and the dysfunctional politics of Washington. Obama holds year end press conference Poll: Obamacare support drops to new low Crossfire: The GOP in 2014? At the same time, polls also show record public dissatisfaction with Congress after two years of stalemate that culminated with the 16-day government shutdown in October. Here are the topics certain to dominate the discussion and influence who ends up as winners and losers a year from now: It\u2019s the economy, as always More than anything else, the state of the economy next December will determine whether Obama had a successful 2014. The President\u2019s main challenge is to make economic growth on paper translate into tangible gains for people. Despite slow but steady growth in 2013, a CNN/ORC poll released Friday showed 70% of respondents considered the economy in generally poor shape, with just over half saying they expected it to remain that way at the end of 2014. Those numbers come as the stock market has surged, unemployment is at a five-year low, auto sales are at a seven-year high, gas prices have dropped and the housing sector that dragged the country into recession in 2008 is rebounding. At the same time, figures remain high for the long-term unemployed, the under-employed and those who have dropped out of or never entered the work force. Some of the unemployed are losing long-term jobless benefits that expired on Saturday. The Obama administration gets credit for the U.S. recovery from recession and the incremental growth of recent years, but Republican opponents argue its policies hinder stronger performance by failing to further reduce federal deficits and debt, lower taxes and ease regulations. CNN Polling Director Keating Holland said several factors contribute to the discrepancy between the economic figures and poll results, including the tendency for public opinion on major issues such as the economy to shift slowly. In addition, he noted that wealthy Americans were probably feeling the benefits of economic growth more than everyone else so far, and that national statistics can mask problems in specific regions. Holland also cited partisan politics, saying that \u201cmany Republicans won\u2019t feel \u2013 or at least admit \u2013 that the economy is improving until there is a Republican in the White House.\u201d \u201cThe same was true for Democrats under either Bush, but when the Republicans are the ones who are badmouthing the economy due to partisan politics, it makes it all the more difficult for good news that only benefits the wealthy to have an impact on the mood of the country overall,\u201d he said. Budget wars Since Republicans won back control of the House in 2010, no Washington fight has been more stubborn than the battles over the budget and taxes. Repeated brinksmanship over spending issues worsened the partisan divide, with both sides accusing the other of intransigence. The October shutdown proved so politically damaging, especially for Republicans, that congressional budget negotiators subsequently worked out a compromise two-year spending framework intended to remove the possibility of a similar impasse until after the November election. Instead, the first spending showdown of 2014 will involve extending long-term unemployment benefits that expired on Saturday. At his yearend news conference on December 20, Obama called for Congress to pass a three-month extension when it returns from holiday in January. House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi chimed in Friday, calling a failure to extend the unemployment benefits expiring for 1.3 million people \u201cimmoral\u201d and adding that \u201cfor the Americans affected by this Republican inaction, there\u2019s no time to waste.\u201d 1.3 million losing unemployment benefits A key question is whether the additional spending to extend the benefits must be offset with savings elsewhere in the federal budget, as demanded by Republicans. Then in late February or early March, the government will run out of money to pay all its bills, requiring an increase in the federal borrowing limit, the Treasury says. Past brinksmanship around the deadline to raise the debt ceiling led to the first downgrade of the U.S. credit rating in 2011, along with condemnation from the public and business community. After the recent budget deal, Republican leaders say they will need concessions on deficit reduction for their party to support a debt ceiling hike. At his news conference, Obama repeated his refusal to negotiate over what he called the obligation of Congress to uphold the nation\u2019s full faith and credit. \u201cNow, I can\u2019t imagine that having seen this possible daylight breaking when it comes to cooperation in Congress that folks are thinking actually about plunging us back into the kinds of brinksmanship and governance by crisis that has done us so much harm over the last couple of years,\u201d Obama said. Immigration reform Meanwhile, Obama and Democrats continue to push for the GOP-led House to vote on a major immigration reform measure already passed by the Democratic-controlled Senate. The measure includes a path to legal status for millions of immigrants living illegally in the United States as part of a broader overhaul of the immigration system. Conservative Republicans consider it an amnesty for illegal immigrants, but moderate Republicans support reforms to make inroads among Hispanic-Americans who traditionally vote Democratic and strongly supported Obama in 2012. Democrats, meanwhile, know that immigration reform would further enhance their party\u2019s popularity among Hispanic-Americans, the nation\u2019s largest minority group. Polls: Majority still support pathway to citizenship Obamacare The most vulnerable issue for Obama and Democrats is the health care reforms known as Obamacare that passed with zero Republican support in 2010. Republicans detest the reforms requiring people to get health coverage as the ultimate example of big government run amok, and will focus their 2014 campaigns on attacking Obama and Democrats over them. While GOP efforts to dismantle or repeal the reforms have failed so far, Republicans got a major boost in October with the failure of the government website set up to help people buy health coverage. Then came reports that insurers were sending cancellation notices to individual policyholders, undermining Obama\u2019s repeated pledge of previous years that \u201cif you like your health care plan, you can keep it.\u201d PolitiFact declared Obama\u2019s false promise its \u201clie of the year,\u201d and the administration lost control of the Obamacare narrative under relentless GOP attacks. Now Republicans warn of more hidden impacts including higher premiums and canceled coverage in the coming year, as Obamacare gets fully implemented. \u201cThis really represents the single \u2026 biggest instance of consumer fraud in the nation\u2019s history,\u201d GOP Sen. John Cornyn of Texas recently told reporters. With the website working better, more than 1.1 million people signed up for coverage between October 1 and December 24 for obtaining a policy effective January 1, Health and Human Services reported in a blog post on Sunday, with 975,000 of those coming during December. Other consumers have until March 31 to enroll, and the administration has eased requirements on some because of the initial problems. Obama and Democrats hope the new momentum after the delayed launch in October can overcome the negative public perception created by the botched launch and fierce GOP criticism. The issue will remain in the public eye, though. Attack ads against Democrats who supported the law already are running in some places. NSA surveillance At his yearend news conference, Obama said he was studying a review he ordered of the National Security Agency surveillance revealed by classified leaks by former contractor Edward Snowden, including the bulk collection of phone records. The President hinted at changes next month when he announces his decisions on the review\u2019s recommendations, citing a need to alleviate public concerns that the government spied on its own people, even if it didn\u2019t. \u201cIt is clear that whatever benefits the configuration of this particular program may have may be outweighed by the concerns that people have on its potential abuse,\u201d Obama said. \u201cAnd, if that\u2019s the case, there may be another way of skinning the cat.\u201d Legal challenges to the surveillance possibly working their way up toward the U.S. Supreme Court could ratchet up pressure on Obama to act. So far, one federal judge ruled the collection of phone records probably violated the Constitution, while another ruled Friday it was legal. The surveillance under the Patriot Act started in the previous administration in the aftermath of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks. It continued during Obama\u2019s presidency and only became public knowledge because of Snowden\u2019s disclosures. For both parties, the issue is tricky because it combines elements of national security and civil liberties to avoid easy categorization as a liberal or conservative matter. Foreign policy The Middle East will remain a major foreign policy focus for Obama in 2014, with deadlines for two substantive negotiations coming up. Talks aimed at forging at least a framework for an Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement are supposed to conclude around the end of April, with negotiations on Iran\u2019s nuclear program given until around June to reach a final agreement. No one expects either issue to get fully resolved in the coming year, but the outcome of the ongoing talks will provide new evidence on whether Obama\u2019s efforts to redefine the U.S. role in global affairs is yielding results. His approach has yielded some success, including the killing of Osama bin Laden, the NATO aerial blockade in Libya and Syria giving up its known chemical weapons supply. Some conservative Republicans who favor a more robust foreign policy criticize Obama for what they call a failure to lead. They cite the 2012 terrorist attack in Benghazi, Libya, that killed four Americans including Ambassador Chris Stevens, as well as continuing turmoil in Egypt following its Arab Spring revolution and the ongoing carnage of Syria\u2019s civil war as U.S. foreign policy failures. The Iran talks involve the most immediate risk. Israel is believed to be poised to launch a military attack if it believes Iran can reach the point of being able to build a nuclear weapon. 20 questions about the nuclear deal In the negotiations involving the United States and the other four permanent members of the U.N. Security Council \u2013 France, Russia, China and Britain \u2013 as well as Germany, Iran is being pressured to give up materials and technology for making a bomb and submit to verification by the international community. Iran\u2019s goal in the talks is to get rid of the sanctions crippling its economy. Israel and U.S. legislators from both parties have criticized a preliminary deal in the talks that froze some of Iran\u2019s nuclear program in exchange for easing some international sanction as the negotiations continue. Meanwhile, U.S. troops in Afghanistan are set to return home by the end of 2014 to conclude the war that began in 2001, after the 9/11 attacks. The administration continues to try to complete a bilateral security agreement with Afghanistan that would to keep some forces in the country beyond 2014. However, even if such an agreement gets worked out, Obama will say he fulfilled his campaign pledge from 2008 to end the long-running wars in Iraq and Afghanistan that he inherited.

            "article_content": "NEW: \"We screwed it up,\" Obama says of health care website woes He said the United States is heading into next year with a stronger economy Obama's 41% approval rating in a new CNN/ORC poll ties a record low for him Polls go up and down, President Obama says, while his concern is helping people Citing economic progress and other achievements, President Barack Obama on Friday rejected the contention that 2013 was the worst year of his presidency. Polls show Obama\u2019s approval rating at record lows for the nearly five years he\u2019s been in office, but he told reporters at a year-end news conference that his concern is whether things are getting better for the American people. \u201cIf you\u2019re measuring this by polls, my polls have gone up and down a lot through the course of my career,\u201d Obama said. \u201cIf I was interested in polling, I wouldn\u2019t have run for President.\u201d Instead, he cited continuing economic growth after the recession he inherited when he took office in January 2009 and other progress, such as more than 1 million people signing up for health insurance so far under the controversial reforms he championed. Obama press conference gets feisty Poll: Obama too conservative for some \u201cThat is a big deal. That\u2019s why I ran for this office,\u201d Obama said. Nagging controversies Later in the news conference that lasted just over an hour, he shrugged off persistent questions about controversies involving Obamacare, government surveillance and other issues with a rudimentary summation of how he sees his administration\u2019s role. \u201cWe get this privilege for a pretty short period of time to do as much as we can for as many people as we can to help them live better lives,\u201d Obama said. At the end, he wished the assembled journalists happy holidays and walked out a few hours before the first family\u2019s trip to Hawaii on Friday night. Obama can\u2019t be sad to see 2013 ending. His legislative agenda outlined in his inauguration address last January after winning re-election and his State of the Union speech a few weeks later made little headway in the divided Congress. Classified leaks by former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden disclosed details of U.S. surveillance efforts that raised questions about whether the government spied on its own people. Then came the botched rollout in October of the new HealthCare.gov website. Instead of cementing Obama\u2019s legacy as the President who helped uninsured Americans get affordable health coverage, the dysfunctional website opened the 2010 Affordable Care Act to a new wave of attacks by Republicans seeking to dismantle the reforms. Obama frustration Obama acknowledged the website problems caused \u201cgreat frustration,\u201d but he rejected GOP claims the overall reform law was failing and should be scrapped. Asked what was his biggest mistake of 2013, the President cited the website woes and accepted responsibility, saying: \u201cSince I\u2019m in charge, obviously we screwed it up.\u201d Another disappointment cited by the President was the inability to get any of his main legislative priorities of 2013 passed by Congress, and he called for 2014 to be a \u201cyear of action\u201d on immigration reform, job creation, expanded background checks on gun purchasers and extending long-term unemployment benefits. \u201cWe head into next year with an economy that\u2019s stronger than it was at the start of the year,\u201d Obama said. \u201cI firmly believe that 2014 can be a breakthrough year for America.\u201d Noting a compromise budget agreement recently passed by Congress after two years of partisan impasses on government spending, Obama said: \u201cIt\u2019s probably too early to declare an outbreak of bipartisanship, but it\u2019s also fair to say that we\u2019re not condemned to endless gridlock.\u201d However, he refused to budge in his rejection of Republican calls for concessions in return for their agreement to increase the federal borrowing limit \u2013 known as the debt ceiling \u2013 when required as soon as early March. \u201cNo, we\u2019re not going to negotiate for Congress to pay bills that it has accrued,\u201d Obama said. \u201cIt is not a negotiating tool.\u201d NSA snooping Asked about the NSA surveillance, Obama defended the government collection of telephone metadata \u2013 records of the time and numbers called with no information on content \u2013 revealed by Snowden\u2019s classified leaks. He said he would make \u201ca pretty definitive\u201d decision in January on recommendations from an independent panel that advised stronger oversight and transparency for the surveillance network without dismantling it. However, Obama added that \u201cwhat is also clear from the public debate, people are concerned about the possibility of abuse,\u201d such as someone listening in on their phone calls. \u201cThis is only going to work if the American people have confidence and trust,\u201d he said, adding there had been no alleged instances of the NSA acting beyond its legal authority in the use of data it collects.

            "article_content": "President Barack Obama's credibility takes a hit in a tough year NSA revelations, botched Obamacare rollout harm his presidency Some controversies were unavoidable, but others were self-inflicted Washington dysfunction halts progress on policy priorities How bad of a year was 2013 for President Barack Obama? The economy is strengthening as he starts to wind down America\u2019s longest war, but his poll numbers are the lowest since he took office almost five years ago. Usually, a growing economy and bringing the troops home mean public love for the commander in chief, but not this time. The flush of success from Obama\u2019s re-election last year faded quickly as his administration faced a series of controversies \u2013 some unavoidable and some self-inflicted \u2013 that eroded Obama\u2019s credibility along with the belief that he can bring about the kind of change he called for in running for president. \u201cPeople don\u2019t think he\u2019s as competent as they used to think,\u201d said CNN Chief Political Analyst Gloria Borger. \u201cThey don\u2019t think he\u2019s as trustworthy as they used to think.\u201d Here are six reasons for the President\u2019s difficult year, starting with his greatest achievement toward the promised change of his first term that became perhaps his biggest liability: the health care reforms known as Obamacare. 1) Obamacare blues Like your health plan ... keep it? If one day in 2013 exemplified Obama\u2019s change in fortune from his first term, it was October 1. That was the launch of the long-awaited HealthCare.gov website that would, in Obama\u2019s words, make getting health insurance required under the Affordable Care Act as easy as shopping on Amazon.com. Obamacare site down\u2026 and back up On the same day, a highly unpopular government shutdown started because of Republican demands to dismantle Obamacare as part of a needed spending measure to keep federal agencies running. It should have been a decisive double play for Democrats, with public anger at Republicans over the eventual 16-day shutdown rising as Americans finally got to experience the full benefits of the health care reforms they had been promised since the law was passed in 2010. But the website malfunctioned badly from the start, with repeated stalling and error messages that made successful navigation impossible for most users. Once the shutdown ended on October 16, media focus shifted to the full extent of the Obamacare website problems. CNN poll: Democrats lose 2014 advantage in Obamacare uproar That gave Republicans fiercely opposed to the health care reforms a new opening to attack both the overall law and the big government approach of Democrats. On top of all this came reports that insurers were sending cancellation notices to individual policy holders that undermined Obama\u2019s repeated pledge of previous years that \u201cif you like your health care plan, you can keep it.\u201d While less than 5% of the population, the individual health insurance market comprised several million people whose stories of canceled policies took over the media narrative. PolitiFact declared Obama\u2019s false promise its \u201clie of the year.\u201d Now Republicans trying to dismantle the reforms warn of more hidden impacts including higher premiums and canceled coverage in the first full year of Obamacare in 2014. \u201cThis really represents the single \u2026 biggest instance of consumer fraud in the nation\u2019s history,\u201d GOP Sen. John Cornyn of Texas told reporters this week. \u201cAnd the American people are increasingly led to the conclusion they cannot trust this administration to say what it means or mean what it says.\u201d Obama brought in outside tech experts to get the website working better, and enrollment figures increased in November and December. However, it remained unclear if the administration can regain control of the narrative. On Friday, the website was down again for a few hours, but Obama boasted to reporters at his year-end news conference that more than 1 million people had enrolled so far. 2) How low can you go? Carney: Everyone has taken a hit Polls show Obama\u2019s support at the lowest levels of his presidency. A new CNN/ORC International survey released Friday showed a drop of 14 percentage points since January in the President\u2019s approval rating, down to 41%. Meanwhile, an ABC News/Washington Post poll this week showed 45% of Americans trusted Republicans to do a better job handling the economy compared to 41% for Obama. It was a different story last December, when the President had a 54%-36% advantage on the same question just after his re-election. Poll: Obama loses large lead over GOP on key issues \u201cIt\u2019s crazy how this has switched, even given the fact that the Republicans blew the government shutdown like they did in October,\u201d Borger said. Obama shrugged off the low poll numbers on Friday, telling reporters at his year-end news conference that \u201cif I was interested in polling, I wouldn\u2019t have run for president.\u201d Instead, he cited continuing economic growth after the recession he inherited when he took office in January 2009 and other progress such as the growing Obamacare enrollment. \u201cThat is a big deal. That\u2019s why I ran for this office,\u201d Obama said. His approval ratings started declining in most national surveys in June as he dealt with controversies such as IRS targeting of tea party groups seeking tax-exempt status and classified leaks that revealed National Security Agency surveillance of phone records. \u201cMany people assume that Obama\u2019s low approval ratings today are due to the flawed health care website that debuted in October,\u201d CNN Polling Director Keating Holland said Thursday. \u201cBut the biggest drop in Obama\u2019s numbers came in the late spring and early summer. In mid-May, Obama\u2019s approval rating was at 53%; by mid-June, after revelations about the IRS and the NSA, it had dropped to 45% and stayed there for several months.\u201d Holland concluded: \u201cIt\u2019s been a bad year for Obama, but his troubles didn\u2019t start in October \u2013 they date back to May and June.\u201d 3) Snowden leaks Obama won't scramble jets for Snowden The Patriot Act passed after the 9/11 attacks led to a huge NSA surveillance network that operated under review by secret courts, with little public knowledge. Then former NSA contractor Edward Snowden leaked a trove of classified documents about it in June. Suddenly, a program Obama inherited became a major problem, as Snowden\u2019s revelations showed the government routinely collected phone records \u2013 but not the content of calls \u2013 for possible use in tracking terrorism suspects. Suspicions that the government spied on its own people ensued, fueled by incomplete or misleading administration responses such as when Director of National Intelligence James Clapper denied to a congressional committee that such surveillance occurred. Snowden\u2019s leaks also made public embarrassing revelations of U.S. spying on allies such as Brazil, France, Mexico and Germany. While Obama never personally bore the brunt of direct responsibility for the extent of the NSA surveillance, the Snowden leaks enhanced a public perception of an administration steeped in secret activities that it denied or tried to continue hiding. Surveillance program now Obama\u2019s to own The issue caused rifts in Obama\u2019s Democratic base, with liberals opposed to the surveillance that the President defended as important for national security. He also has angered the liberal wing by continuing the policy of his immediate predecessor, Republican President George W. Bush, to use drone strikes against terrorism targets abroad. 4) IRS targeting Rep. Issa expands IRS investigation An inspector general\u2019s report in May that showed the IRS targeted conservative groups in determining extra scrutiny of applications for tax-exempt status was the scandal du jour in Washington before being relegated to back-burner status by the Snowden leaks. Republicans called the targeting a conspiracy of Nixonian dimensions, while Democrats condemned it as bureaucratic rather than political malfeasance. IRS proposes new rules for tax-exempt organizations An internal investigation found no evidence of anti-conservative conspiracy, and officials eventually determined that IRS employees also used terms referring to liberal or progressive groups in their screening. Regardless of the outcome, the IRS controversy bolstered Republican efforts to portray the administration as willing to push a partisan agenda to the edge of legal limits and perhaps beyond. 5) Stalled agenda Cruz: Obamacare is hurting millions CNN Chief National Correspondent John King called Obama \u201c0 for-2013\u201d in terms of what he proposed in his State of the Union Address in February with what got passed by Congress. No immigration reform. No jobs program. No tax reform. No increase in the minimum wage. No expanded background checks on gun purchases in the wake of the Newtown school massacre despite a major push by the President. Obama and Democrats blame Republicans for obstructing possible progress in a divided government with different parties controlling the House and Senate. \u201cThis last year has been totally obstructed.  Everything we\u2019ve tried to do, we have been stopped,\u201d Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid complained on Thursday. Republicans contend it was Obama who prevented progress by refusing to seriously consider their positions or concerns, accusing him of a \u201cmy way or the highway\u201d approach. The partisan impasse was most evident in the repeated showdowns over federal spending that culminated in the October shutdown. Conservative Republicans got the most blame for the shutdown because of their failed effort to tie  the budget negotiations to dismantling Obamacare. But polls showed public anger at everyone over the brinkmanship that economists said hindered the nation\u2019s slow but steady economic growth. A budget compromise worked out after the shutdown amounted to rare bipartisan cooperation on spending issues. The House and Senate easily passed the two-year spending framework that puts off further shutdowns over the budget until after next year\u2019s congressional elections, and Obama has signaled he will sign it. \u201cIt\u2019s probably too early to declare an outbreak of bipartisanship, but it\u2019s also fair to say that we\u2019re not condemned to endless gridlock\u201d that led to the government shutdown in October, Obama said on Friday. The question is whether election year politics will bring the usual hardening of partisan positions, or if legislators believe further compromise will boost their standing with voters. Obama called for Congress to make 2014 a \u201cyear of action\u201d on issues such as immigration reform, job creation and expanding background checks on gun buyers. However, he refused to budge in his rejection of Republican calls for concessions in return for their agreement to increase the federal borrowing limit \u2013 known as the debt ceiling \u2013 when required as soon as early March. 6) Reality versus perception Jon Stewart, others take on Obamacare What do you remember about Obama\u2019s speech at Nelson Mandela\u2019s funeral? For most people, the answer will be the interpreter accused of making up sign language, or Obama huddling with the Danish and British prime ministers for an apparent \u201cselfie\u201d photo, rather than anything the President said. He isn\u2019t the first President to be trivialized by the media and joked about on late-night talk shows, but coupled with the endless Republican attacks and low poll numbers, the perception of Obama has changed dramatically from the freshly re-elected leader praised for a dynamic inauguration speech last January. Critics enjoyed skewering him over a series of diplomatic jabs scored by Russian President Vladimir Putin, who ignored a U.S. request to return classified leaker Snowden to face prosecution and intervened diplomatically in Syria after Obama failed to muster an international force to punish the Syrian regime for crossing his \u201cred line\u201d on using chemical weapons. In the end, though, Obama appeared to get what he wanted without putting any U.S. troops at risk, as Syria \u2013 under pressure from ally Russia \u2013 handed over control of its known chemical weapons arsenal to the international community. A bad year for sure, but not the death knell of his presidency. \u201cCan he turn it around? Sure he can,\u201d CNN Political Commentator Ryan Lizza said. \u201cI think his fortunes will be about the improving economy, and there\u2019s a lot of good economic news coming out right now and 2014-2015. If the economy turns around, those (poll) numbers that we saw will turn around.\u201d CNN\u2019s Paul Steinhauser contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Internal report recommends Republicans change course and learn to appeal to more people After Mark Sanford's comeback win, don't be surprised to see him looking at Senate race Virginia Republicans took a hard right turn, lost top-of-ticket races Anthony Weiner's campaign came crashing down after he admitted to more sexting In political parlance, 2013 was an off-off year. With the presidential campaign in the rearview and no midterm elections on the table, this year\u2019s political focus was mostly on the tedium of Washington, where President Barack Obama and congressional Republicans fought a lot but accomplished very little. But with two big governor\u2019s races, a handful of special congressional elections, a mayoral race in New York City and a Republican Party still struggling to find its footing, there was still plenty of action to keep campaign junkies occupied this year. Here are the biggest campaign moments from 2013: March 18: Republican National Committee releases \u2018autopsy\u2019 RNC 'autopsy' reviews 2012 election After Obama\u2019s re-election, Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus commissioned an independent task force to scrutinize the GOP\u2019s failures in 2012 in hopes that the party might be able to fix its damaged brand and broken infrastructure before the next presidential race. The report, unveiled with much fanfare in March after several months of research and consultation with party operatives, activists and elected officials, was blunt \u2013 even scathing. Its authors recommended that Republicans \u201cchange course\u201d and \u201clearn once again how to appeal to more people.\u201d The GOP needs to be tougher on Wall Street, more sensitive to America\u2019s booming Hispanic population and more appealing to a younger generation of voters, it said. The party must also fix its badly outdated voter contact and turnout operations, the report said. RNC to spend $10 million on Republican outreach For Republican pragmatists in Washington fed up with the metastasizing influence of hard-right activists in the party ranks, the so-called \u201cautopsy\u201d was a much-needed dose of straight talk. But for grass-roots conservatives, it felt like another attempt to impose a squishy, win-at-all-costs strategy on the party\u2019s ideological base. How much impact has it had? There were some exit poll bright spots for the GOP on Election Day 2013: Republican Gov. Chris Christie won a majority of Hispanic voters in New Jersey, and Ken Cuccinelli, Virginia\u2019s Republican nominee for governor, won voters between the ages of 18 and 24. RNC officials used the races to test a range of voter contact strategies, and the committee installed a fresh batch of political operatives in states around the country. But Cuccinelli lost his race to Democrat Terry McAuliffe, in part because women were turned off by his staunch social conservative views on health care. Meanwhile, in Washington, House Republicans balked at passing a comprehensive immigration reform bill that might have repaired their standing among Hispanics. And tea party-aligned House members mounted an anti-Obamacare stand that resulted in a 16-day partial shutdown of the federal government and further crippled the party\u2019s already weak standing in public opinion polls. It\u2019s too soon to measure GOP results against the autopsy. The first real test will come in 2014. But the 2013 election season showed that the party\u2019s challenges are still very real. May 7: The return of Mark Sanford Sanford's stunning political comeback Mark Sanford\u2019s political career was left for dead in the summer of 2009, when he mysteriously disappeared from the South Carolina governor\u2019s mansion and later revealed in a tearful news conference that he had been in Argentina rendezvousing with a woman who was not his wife. Sanford served out his term in Columbia, but his future in national politics was over. So was his marriage. Sanford completes political comeback in South Carolina race A fierce fiscal conservative whose limited-government views presaged the emergence of the tea party movement, Sanford might have been a front-runner for the Republican presidential nomination in 2012 were it not for his affair. He spent a few years in the wilderness and became engaged to his lover, but his ambition never wilted. He brazenly decided to return to public life this year, in a special congressional election prompted by former Rep. Tim Scott\u2019s appointment to the Senate. Sanford had many advantages: He was running in the same Republican-leaning district he once represented in Congress, and despite his scandal-tainted name, he had the twin assets of fame and money. Apologizing to voters for his past behavior and promising to fight spending in Washington, Sanford breezed past a little-known group of GOP primary opponents in April and then defeated comedian Stephen Colbert\u2019s sister in a barely competitive general election. Why does it matter? Sanford\u2019s chances of being president are nonexistent, but don\u2019t be surprised if the conservative takes a look at running for the Senate, or even his former gubernatorial seat, after a few more years of political rehab. May 18: Virginia Republicans lurch to the right How McAuliffe, Christie won The Republican ticket in Virginia might have been doomed from the start. The conservatives who dominate the state party apparatus decided last year to nominate statewide candidates with a convention rather than a primary \u2013 a move designed to benefit state Attorney General Ken Cuccinelli, a tea party hero and stalwart social conservative running for governor in 2013. McAuliffe: \u2018I always said it was going to be close\u2019 The decision meant that only a few thousand hard-core activists would be selecting the party\u2019s candidates for governor, lieutenant governor and attorney general at the party\u2019s state convention in May \u2013 effectively sidelining the more centrist candidates who stood zero chance of winning the GOP nomination under the circumstances. All went according to plan: A few thousand passionate Republicans at the Richmond Coliseum tapped Cuccinelli, an outspoken controversial pastor named E.W. Jackson, and state Sen. Mark Obenshain to run in November. Candidates run independent of one another in Virginia, but taken together, it was the most ideologically conservative ticket ever nominated by Virginia Republicans. How\u2019d it work out in one of the country\u2019s premier battleground states? Cuccinelli lost. Jackson lost. As for Obenshain, he lost the attorney general\u2019s race by 165 votes and called for a recount that will begin later this month. July 23: The Weiner news conference Anthony Weiner sexting scandal Former New York Rep. Anthony Weiner\u2019s political comeback attempt was looking pretty good this summer. After a scandal involving lewd pictures he shared with women he met online, and the ham-fisted coverup that followed, Weiner resigned from Congress in 2011. But the Democrat still had his eye on the job he had always coveted: mayor of New York City. After image rehab that included some fawning media coverage about his time in the political wilderness and the improving state of his marriage to Huma Abedin, an aide to Hillary Clinton, Weiner was primed to jump back into the fray. And when he did, voters seemed willing to offer him a second chance. He soared to the top of the Democratic primary polls, leapfrogging the front-runner at the time, City Council Speaker Christine Quinn. For a while, it appeared he could actually ride the momentum through Election Day. He was facing a weak field of opponents, was ideologically in tune with the Democratic primary electorate, and lacked any deep ties to the polarizing mayor, Michael Bloomberg. His brash personality might have turned off voters in any other corner of the country, but in New York, he fit right in. Those hopes came crashing down in July when it surfaced that Weiner had continued his naughty Internet chats after leaving Congress and well into 2012, a timeline that didn\u2019t square with what he had previously said. Adding insult to grave political injury, Sydney Leathers \u2013 the improbably named young woman he chatted with online \u2013 revealed that Weiner had used the alias \u201cCarlos Danger\u201d in their exchanges. In Weiner\u2019s final days, more curiosity than candidate Weiner copped to his bad behavior in a nationally televised Manhattan press conference, with Abedin at his side, and pledged to remain in the race. But from that point on, Weiner\u2019s campaign amounted to little \u2013 aside from some fiery confrontations with voters and tabloid copy about Abedin\u2019s very noticeable absence from the campaign. Weiner finished in a distant fifth place in the September primary and once again vanished from the spotlight. August 8: The Dante ad Meet New York's new first family Bill de Blasio this year became the first Democrat to be elected mayor of New York City since 1989. He has his son to thank for that. De Blasio, the city\u2019s public advocate and a former city councilman from Brooklyn, entered the mayor\u2019s race as a long shot. He was a skilled political operator who had maneuvered his way up the food chain of New York City politics, but he wasn\u2019t exactly Mr. Personality. 5 things about New York\u2019s new mayor But de Blasio placed a prescient early bet that the city was souring on the Wall Street-friendly Bloomberg administration. Back in 2012, he outlined a tax-the-rich plan that would fund a universal pre-K program for city children. In May, he laid out a \u201ctale of two cities\u201d campaign theme that tapped into middle-class anxieties about income inequality. But voters still weren\u2019t paying attention. Enter Dante. The campaign decided to use de Blasio\u2019s 15-year-old son in a simple campaign ad that would showcase the candidate\u2019s mixed-race family \u2013 his wife, Chirlane, is black \u2013 while also touching on the campaign\u2019s major themes. Looking straight into a camera that perfectly framed up his signature Afro, Dante said his father was the \u201conly Democrat with the guts to really break from the Bloomberg years\u201d \u2013 and end the city\u2019s controversial stop-and-frisk police tactics. The ad struck a chord with the city\u2019s Democrats and the candidate never looked back. Almost overnight, his support in the polls doubled, and he quickly overtook Quinn as the outright front-runner. At stop after stop throughout August and September, the de Blasio family was swarmed by adoring voters. De Blasio cruised to the Democratic nomination and overwhelmed his token GOP opponent to win the election in November. November 6: Christie wins a majority of Hispanic voters Gov. Christie in the national spotlight They won\u2019t come out and say it, but Chris Christie\u2019s political team, quietly laying groundwork for a likely presidential bid in 2016, had long hoped to use his sure-shot re-election bid in New Jersey to burnish his credentials as a Republican with crossover appeal. They scored a huge talking point on election night. With national Republicans struggling to connect with Hispanics, a voting bloc that Mitt Romney lost by an almost 3-1 margin in 2012, Christie actually won a majority of Hispanic voters in New Jersey, clearing 51% in the exit polls. How Christie took over the RGA Compared to his first race in 2009, Christie improved his performance among Hispanics by nearly 20 points. The campaign spent over $1 million on Spanish-language television and radio and sent direct mail to Hispanic voters they had targeted as persuadable. Christie himself spoke to Latino groups and campaigned aggressively in urban areas, lining up endorsements from Hispanic leaders. Campaign aides point to the results out of the Hispanic stronghold of Union City as an indicator of his hard work: Obama thumped Romney in the city in 2012, but Christie won it in November. Of course, Christie was running against a weak and underfunded Democratic opponent. And since his re-election, Christie has waffled on signing a \u201ctuition equality\u201d bill for the children of illegal immigrants that he said he supported during the campaign. But that won\u2019t stop his aides from touting his performance. \u201cHis success among Hispanics in the campaign was an extension of how he governed the previous three years and the efforts he made,\u201d said Christie adviser Mike DuHaime. \u201cThe campaign expended real resources, both financially and with the candidate\u2019s time, to make sure the campaign did well among Hispanics. Winning them outright is a big achievement for any Republican.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Bipartisan budget deal first to pass divided Congress since 1986 It could pave the way for future bipartisanship But contentious issues and an election year could hamper progress When Republican Rep. Paul Ryan and Democratic Sen. Patty Murray held a news conference \u2013 together \u2013 to announce that they reached a deal on the federal budget, the ideological opposites received immediate praise for their cooperation. And they reached their agreement that would avert a potential government shutdown in January just two days before the Congressionally imposed deadline for doing so. The proposal that was heading for final congressional approval in the Senate on Wednesday is being held up for all to see as a rare illustration of bipartisanship in a deeply divided Washington that could lead to greater Congressional comity. Murray: Budget deal was a compromise Roundtable: Obama's low approval ratings GOP divided over budget deal It\u2019s \u201can important step in helping to heal some of the wounds here in Congress,\u201d Murray said when she announced the agreement with Ryan. No-drama budget vote: How can this be? While she suggested the act of working together has the potential to influence the mood in Congress to be more agreeable, the deal removes a significant obstacle that has led to legislative gridlock so far this decade. For the next two years, Congress has a binding restriction on the amount of money it can spend. The deal split the difference between the amount that Republicans and Democrats wanted to spend \u2013 $1.012 trillion for 2014 and $1.014 trillion for 2015. \u201cThis means we can fund the operations of government through regular, annual appropriations bills, instead of through last-minute, stop-gap bills that put the government on autopilot,\u201d said Sen. Barbara Mikulski, who sits at the head of the Appropriations Committee. A big deal That\u2019s a big deal. It\u2019s the first time that a budget agreement has passed a divided House and the Senate since 1986, according to Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid. \u201cGridlock has got to end and it is ending,\u201d Reid told reporters. \u201cIt\u2019s really a step forward.\u201d But will it end gridlock? \u201cNo,\u201d Congressional scholar Thomas Mann of the Brookings Institution said. \u201cI don\u2019t expect it to have any lasting consequences,\u201d Mann said. The budget agreement only solves part of the problem. While it sets spending levels, it doesn\u2019t actually allocate the money and doesn\u2019t specify how the money can be spent. That battle will begin immediately. Appropriations Committee members must agree before January 15 \u2013 the deadline set by Congress in October for a new spending plan to be in place \u2013 on how to divvy up the money. For instance, Republicans will want more money for the military. Democrats will want more money for Head Start programs. \u201cWe may not even be through with this,\u201d Mann said. And that\u2019s not the only issue of contention to be worked out in January alone. Extended unemployment insurance benefits are set to expire December 28, which will leave 1.3 million people without benefits and hit another 800,000 in the coming weeks. Despite the looming deadline, the issue was shelved in order to reach a budget deal. Reid vowed to address the issue immediately upon the Senate\u2019s return in January. Republicans, however, are not keen on the extending the already expanded program. Again? Before the budget deal even becomes law, signs of serious strife are already emerging around the debt ceiling, the nation\u2019s borrowing limit, which is expected to be tapped in February. Since 2010, the debt limit has sparked partisan fights and near-government shutdowns as Republicans want an increase in the debt ceiling tied to spending cuts. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine the Republicans want another fight on debt ceiling,\u201d Reid told reporters Tuesday. But they are. And the foundation is being laid for a major battle in the new year. \u201cWe don\u2019t want nothing out of this debt limit,\u201d Ryan said Sunday on Fox News. Over in the Senate, the sentiment is similar. A top Republican indicated that he expects his caucus to push for concessions related to reducing government spending. \u201cEvery time the President asks us to raise the debt ceiling is a good time to try to achieve something important for the country,\u201d Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said Tuesday. An election year Further complicating this so-called season of bipartisanship is that 2014 is an election year, historically a time when less gets accomplished in Congress as lawmakers become even more risk averse and spend even more time fund-raising and campaigning. Lawmakers up for re-election are reluctant to take risky votes. And a decent indicator of how Congress deals with next year\u2019s prickly battles is that all seven Republican Senators facing primary challengers in 2014 were opponents of the budget deal. And in the House, where all members are up for reelection, primary challengers are also common, forcing lawmakers to appeal to party activists often by shunning compromise. And that is unlikely to subside. Even though House Speaker John Boehner surprisingly criticized conservative groups publicly last week, no one on Capitol Hill expects the Ohio Republican to become the champion of bipartisanship. To be determined A host of issues still need to be worked out, including the Farm Bill, which affects the price consumers pay for groceries, payments to doctors who see Medicare patients, and immigration. And even the budget deal were to be reworked post-passage. Some lawmakers, including South Carolina Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham, vow to reverse a provision that reduces retirement benefits for military families. Mann said the budget deal is a singular instance of cooperation because it played into both parties best interests. Both parties avoided being labeled obstructionists and extremists. \u201cThis isn\u2019t about good feelings among members but strategic behavior by two parties,\u201d Mann said. Bipartisanship is, ultimately, a partisan play. Military retirees \u2018screwed\u2019 in budget deal CNN\u2019s Gregory Wallace and Deirdre Walsh contributed to this report",

            "article_content": "The House will not take up immigration legislation this year A bill is \"not ripe and not ready,\" a Republican strategist says But Republican leaders keep the door open for next year It\u2019s pretty clear the House of Representatives is not going to take up immigration reform this year. Even after President Barack Obama said he was willing to consider immigration legislation in pieces instead of one large bill \u2013 which House Speaker John Boehner has suggested \u2013 just a handful of workdays remain for the House this year. Obama\u2019s concession might open the door for the House to consider the issue next year, but it\u2019s going to take more than the president\u2019s backing. And more than his personal campaigning. Related: Protests meet Obama at immigration event Speaking to supporters in San Francisco Monday, Obama called on House Republicans to take up the bill already passed by the Senate. \u201cIt\u2019s long past time to fix our broken immigration system,\u201d he said. GOPer to vote with Dems on immigration Rubio: We need Obamacare penalty delay McCain: Millions live in the shadows With the growing Latino population, the national Republican Party understands it must embrace the immigration issue. Additionally, the public supports action. Two polls released this month show an overwhelming majority of Americans \u2013 63% in a Public Religion Research Institute survey and 57% in a Quinnipiac poll \u2013 support a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants. Related: Polls: Majority still support pathway to citizenship But some factions within the Republican base are adamantly opposed to any legislation that includes a path to citizenship. This division creates a challenge for Republicans. Their answer: maybe later. GOP strategist Ana Navarro told CNN that the timing \u201cis just not right\u201d and that the legislation is \u201cnot ripe and not ready.\u201d Here are some scenarios when the timing could be right: 1. When Obamacare works As long as the Affordable Care Act is receiving negative headlines, immigration will be on the back burner. During a discussion last week on the House floor between Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Virginia, and Minority Whip Steny Hoyer, D-Maryland, Cantor repeatedly pivoted away from the issue of immigration to Obamacare. \u201cWhat\u2019s going on with Obamacare right now \u2026 I don\u2019t think we ought to be engaging in those kinds of commitments when you can\u2019t deliver,\u201d Cantor said about bringing up immigration. Hoyer responded: \u201cWe understand \u2026 you\u2019d like to talk about health care without talking about anything else. I get that.\u201d Related: Biden welcomes new Americans, slams Boehner on immigration bill The GOP sees Obamacare as a winning issue politically. It\u2019s a major reason it won back the House in 2010, and the head of the Republican National Committee declared Republicans will run on Obamacare in 2014. Republicans are reticent to change the subject while they appear to be winning the message war. 2. \u2018The sweet spot\u2019 The House can bring up immigration legislation in 2014, but controversial topics are usually swept under the rug come election time. Navarro said that next year, particularly the summer, might be the right time. \u201cThe sweet spot is to do it sometime so it\u2019s far enough from the election so it doesn\u2019t become a big issue,\u201d she said. Related: Pro-immigration attack ads to target House Republicans In other words, don\u2019t upset the parts of the base that are anti-immigration but appeal to the majority of Americans who support an overhaul of the immigration system. The former could be prove more tricky as Republicans have to take into consideration primary voters and the possibility of primary challengers. Some factions of the Republican Party are against any bill that includes a path to citizenship or legal residency for undocumented immigrants, which they see as amnesty. For instance, Heritage Action for America, a lobbying and campaign arm of the conservative Heritage Foundation think tank, worked to get Senate Republicans to vote against the immigration bill last spring. Immigration is not considered a top-tier issue, but Republicans do risk backlash. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Florida, said he regretted his vote on comprehensive immigration reform that included a path to citizenship and that passed in the Senate this year. He helped to draft the bill. Frank Sharry, executive director of America\u2019s Voice, a pro-immigration group involved in pushing legislation through the House, said the GOP leadership is considering the stances of immigration opponents. \u201cBoehner and company seem a bit more concerned with tea party types \u2026 more concerned with their conservative members who could face ouster,\u201d Sharry said. If the House waits long enough next year to bring up immigration, it would be too late for immigration to be an issue in the primaries and, perhaps more importantly, too late for challengers to jump in the race and make it an issue. 3. Feelings must be mended Leslie Sanchez, a Republican strategist who has worked on immigration for nearly two decades, said it is a must-pass issue for the GOP to stay a relevant political party at the national level. But she said \u201ca hostile political environment\u201d is the biggest factor in prohibiting immigration legislation. Related: Shutdown threat imperils immigration reform The recent government shutdown was perhaps a low point during an already perilous time in Washington. The trust factor between the two parties plummeted. Rep. Michael McCaul, R-Texas, refused to attend a meeting at the White House to discuss immigration, calling it a \u201ctrap.\u201d \u201cThe shutdown was very toxic. Right now, it\u2019s very difficult,\u201d said Navarro, the Republican strategist. And Ali Noorani, executive director of the National Immigration Forum, said few lawmakers from opposite parties are talking to each other. \u201cI just think the lines of communication between the parties have really broken down,\u201d Noorani said. 4. When Republican proponents outweigh opponents Another problem inhibiting an immigration bill is lack of incentives for Republican lawmakers to stick their necks out. \u201cRepublicans have not gotten to yes,\u201d Sharry said. And until they do, Boehner is reluctant to bring a bill to the floor. \u201cI don\u2019t think they will bring it up until they can get it passed,\u201d Navarro said, highlighting that Boehner is reluctant to bring a bill to the floor that would pass with mostly Democratic support. One immigration proposal similar to the Senate version has the support of 190 lawmakers, a handful of whom are Republicans. Rep. Jeff Denham, a Republican from an agricultural region of California, is one of the bill\u2019s co-sponsors. He said there are at least six more Republicans who support the bill but haven\u2019t come out publicly yet. But that\u2019s far short of a majority. To get more on board, a coalition of \u201cbibles, business and badges\u201d \u2013 representing key constituencies \u2013 is attempting to use its influence to pressure Republicans. Related: Zuckerberg-backed group makes new immigration push \u201cIt\u2019s going to take a great deal of momentum and districts from across the nation,\u201d Denham said. Now that Boehner said there will be not bill this year, Republicans have little reason to put their name on legislation that could be politically disadvantageous. \u201cThe biggest challenge of this bill is there is not a deadline,\u201d Denham said. \u201cThat\u2019s part of the reason this continues to get pushed.\u201d",

Bill Clinton\u2019s affair with Monica Lewinsky and his impeachment by the House marked his second term. Those aren\u2019t the only instances. Ronald Reagan had the Iran-Contra scandal; Harry Truman\u2019s final years in office were dominated by the war in Korea and Richard Nixon resigned over Watergate.

Under new leadership, Act II of the Reagan White House did not hit on all cylinders. The Iran-Contra affair, in which the Reagan administration was fingered for selling arms to Iran and circumventing a congressional ban by using the proceeds to send arms and money to anti-Communist rebels in Nicaragua, became a huge scandal. \u201cIt was disaster at the White House,\u201d Riley said. \u201cThat is not a mistake you make typically in a first term. It is case where you are trying to juggle the staffing apparatus later on.\u201d Digging for dirt and sensing a lame duck To David Nichols, a presidential historian and expert on President Dwight Eisenhower, the reason for second-term woes is a combination of leverage and time. \u201cTheir leverage on lawmakers in the Congress and with the voters is just inevitably diminished,\u201d Nichols said, pointing out that once Congress begins to smell presidential weakness, they seize on it as a way to speed up the \u201clame duck\u201d process. \u201cThe longer Presidents are around and when people get to know you well, they begin to know where your soft spots are and they know what you are good and what you aren\u2019t good at,\u201d Nichols said. \u201cPeople eventually begin to figure out how to get to the Presidents. That is just a function of the number of years.\u201d To Nichols, this could already be happening with Obama. Cruz talks about \u2018vindication\u2019 Obamacare enrollment numbers give GOP second wind Why Obamacare is a 'house of cards' How did Obama not know of website woes? Republicans in Congress have been attacking Obama since his 2009 inaugural. And while Obama has won some legislative victories, those have been hard fought. The health care law he championed and got with only Democratic support in Congress is off to a rocky start with the public, and Republicans are sensing weakness. Poll: Approval of Obamacare drops And with that, Nichols said, comes Republican dreams of a larger majority in the House, control of the Senate and a pathway to the presidency in 2016. \u201cFor the opposition party, the more bad stuff they can dig up, the better they make it for themselves in the next election,\u201d Nichols said. \u201cSo tearing down the incumbent is a good way to prepare the way for a change and the American public tends to keep people for a while but quickly push them out.\u201d Clinton\u2019s experience is a good example. While accusations of infidelity plagued Clinton since his time as governor of Arkansas, it wasn\u2019t until years into his presidency that an accusation of impropriety was able to stick and severely damage him politically. The chickens come home to roost When Obama ran for office in 2008, he made a number of promises: immigration reform, healthcare, ending wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, dealing with climate change. During his first term, he addressed some of those \u2013 ending the war in Iraq and slowly drawing down the conflict in Afghanistan. His administration also won on Obamacare. 6 things presidents wish they hadn\u2019t said But the implications of those promises were not felt right away, Riley said. Romney on Obamacare promise: \u2018It was not honest\u2019 \u201cYou make policy decisions in the first term and because it usually takes a while for these things to mature and to ripen and to get enacted, you can easily be in your fifth year before the full consequences of your first term become apparent,\u201d Riley said. \u201cWhen you get to the second term, the days of reckoning appear.\u201d Riley\u2019s point is that when Obama promised to reform the health care system, he and his advisers had to know there was going to be pain involved with executing the law. But as with most administrations, Riley said, the White House also knew those problems weren\u2019t going to come about for years. \u201cPresidents will always make decisions either to defer judgment on something or will make hard decisions, recognizing the consequences won\u2019t come down on them until after reelection,\u201d Riley said. \u201cI think it is just a general pattern.\u201d The history of two terms Although two terms is now the law, it was once just a tradition started by George Washington. After serving two terms, Washington declined to run again. \u201cWhile choice and prudence invite me to quit the political scene, patriotism does not forbid it,\u201d Washington said, acknowledging he could have run again had he wanted to. He didn\u2019t and the tradition was formed and stood until Franklin Roosevelt ran and won four times, dying soon into his final term as World War II was drawing to a close. After FDR, the 22nd Amendment to the Constitution set a two-term limit. Bachmann: \u2018I lost my insurance under Obamacare\u2019",

            "article_content": "Administration facing persistent questions about credibility, competence Democratic veteran questions whether White House learns from mistakes Obama's poll numbers at same place as George W. Bush's at this point in his presidency Timing of crisis is key -- every day brings midterm elections closer, loyalty harder to maintain With his presidency at a crossroads, President Barack Obama delivered his health care \u201cfix it\u201d message with a healthy dose of reflection and contrition: \u201cI think I said early on when I was running, I am not a perfect man and I will not be a perfect president.\u201d CNNMoney: Obama offers fix for canceled plans At the moment, the challenge is to get back to being a productive president, and those who see a difficult path ahead include veteran Democrats the President counts among his most trusted friends and allies. \u201cCan Obama come back?\u201d a veteran Democratic strategist asked. \u201cYes. But like Carter and (George W.) Bush, his downfall is his handling of  the job.\u201d This party sage framed the stakes this way: \u201cThe next few months will tell us whether he will be remembered in the pantheon of successful/consequential presidents in the last 60 years or whether he will be a flawed president whose skills did not match the times.\u201d Obama not informed on website failure Obama: We fumbled the rollout of this law Obama proposes fix for canceled policies Obama: We will not gut this law After the President\u2019s lengthy appearance in the White House briefing room Thursday, Republicans were scathing in making the case it was too little too late and proof, to them, Obamacare was collapsing. Predictable, but an argument that has more weight now is that the President, using his terms, \u201cfumbled\u201d the rollout of his signature domestic initiative. At an Ohio event later Thursday, the President promised to vigorously fight any effort to \u201cgut\u201d the law, and as that debate continues, it is the mood among his fellow Democrats that is most important. Obama: \u2018I\u2019m going to see this through\u2019 Initial reaction was hardly reassuring to the White House. Democrats in both the House and Senate mixed praise of the President\u2019s intentions with promises to not trust the administration to fix the problems without guidance from Congress. Senate Dem leaders holding off on legislative \u2018fix\u2019 for insurance promise This is the new political reality: the President himself acknowledged the rollout was hurting his party\u2019s standing heading into the 2014 midterm election season. While he promised to work hard to turn the political tide, Democrats hoping to be in Washington beyond the end of 2016 \u2013 meaning beyond the Obama years \u2013 will be less and less reluctant with each passing day to trust their fate to his plans and instincts. Especially because of those polls the President suggested he doesn\u2019t read. For Democrats, especially given the timing, the numbers are numbing: Whether you look at the low Obamacare enrollment figures or President Obama\u2019s declining poll standing, what you see is a White House \u2013 and a presidency \u2013 at a crossroads, facing persistent questions about credibility and competence. Borger: How could Obama not have known? Manchin: Obamacare problems persist How did Obama not know of website woes? AHIP \"concerned\" over Obamacare fix Mixed reactions to Obamacare \"fix\" Why Obamacare is a 'house of cards' The question now consuming Washington is whether this is just a temporary bad turn or a tipping point. In a more sympathetic take, a senior veteran of both Obama presidential campaigns and the first White House term put it this way:  \u201cI feel for him and my old colleagues. Tough when you\u2019re in the penalty box.\u201d That view assumes the penalty clock expires, and the President rallies. Republican missteps in the past \u2013 like the government shutdown \u2013 give many Democrats hope the President\u2019s critics will overreach again and create an opening for a rebound. Poll: Approval of health care law drops Less sympathetic, though, was another seasoned Democrat, this one a veteran of the Bill Clinton White House. \u201cThey don\u2019t have the time, or the self-awareness,\u201d to objectively study and learn from recent mistakes, this longtime Democratic operative said of the President and his second-term team. \u201cWhat they do not appreciate is how far away they are from the end of the second term. We had not even had (Monica) Lewinsky yet at this point,\u201d the operative said, referring to Clinton\u2019s White House affair with an intern. Noting the sagging poll numbers and increasing public complaints from the President\u2019s fellow Democrats, this source, speaking only on condition of anonymity, predicted a rough stretch ahead: \u201cThere will be a ton of stories about the need for new and fresh staff and how Obama needs to open his circle up to people who he does not know, or at least not well.\u201d New polls showing the President at new lows in several categories are only increasing a case of Democratic jitters that began once it was clear the Obamacare rollout was going poorly, and that any political advantage Democrats gained from the government shutdown was fading. Obamacare promises: Where things stand The latest Quinnipiac University poll found just 39% of Americans approve of how the President is handling his job; 54% disapprove. Those numbers are similar to President George W. Bush\u2019s standing at this point in his second term. In an especially troubling turn, that same survey found \u2013 even though congressional approval ratings are at an all time low \u2013 voters trust Republicans in Congress as much or more than the President on big issues like health care and the economy. In the past, the President\u2019s strong personal standing with voters has helped him through stretches when voters question his job performance. But there are signs he cannot, at least at this delicate moment, count on that traditional safety net. The Quinnipiac poll, for example, found for the first time more voters say the Presidency is not trustworthy. The timing is what makes this rut even more complicated \u2013 and potentially consequential \u2013 for the President and his second term. Every day brings the 2014 midterm elections closer, and with the President\u2019s standing low, loyalty within his own party becomes harder to maintain. House Democrats cool down after Obamacare meeting Bachmann: I lost my health insurance Obamacare by the numbers 'We will see millions more people sign up' Cantor on constituents who like Obamacare Evidence of that is abundant, from the Senate Democrats pushing for Obamacare changes, to meetings between congressional Democrats and White House officials this week that turned testy as lawmakers aired their complains about the Obamacare rollout and how it was hurting the party politically. In Obama\u2019s 2008 campaign, he ran as much against the struggling Bush administration as he did against the GOP nominee. Back then, questions about the Iraq war and the federal response to Hurricane Katrina had put front and center the questions President Obama now faces \u2013 about credibility and competence. Boehner: Obamacare \u201ca rolling calamity\u201d \u201cThere is a very tender and important period for the President,\u201d said the veteran Democratic strategist. Instead of a Katrina analogy, this Democrat looked for a parallel within his own party \u2013 the Carter presidency. \u201cHealth care could become his energy shortage,\u201d the strategist said. Health care reform was the signature initiative and achievement of the President\u2019s first term, yet the continuing debate over the program, and the administration\u2019s rollout, is now holding his second term agenda hostage. A look back at the State of the Union address from the beginning of this year is a reminder that the President has realized nothing from his wish list, which included news jobs programs, an increase in the minimum wage and major immigration reforms. Getting things done in the second year \u2013 the midterm election year in which Obamacare is certain to be the central issue \u2013  would be difficult even if the President found a path to improve his political standing.  Especially if Democrats lose faith in the White House as Republicans did with George W. Bush and his team.

            "article_content": "Christie follows big re-election win with yearlong stint as head of GOP governors The position offers Christie networking opportunities but also makes him target Republicans next year elect governors in key states that are also key states in 2016 primaries A big challenge for Christie is convincing conservative Republicans he's one of them What do you do for an encore after a landslide re-election victory? How about taking your show on the road. And that\u2019s just what New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie will do later this month, as he takes over as chairman of the Republican Governors Association, giving an already very visible governor with national aspirations even more visibility. While the high-profile position should enhance Christie\u2019s status as a leader of the GOP, he\u2019s already coming under attack from some potential 2016 rivals. Christie wins big With three-dozen states electing governors in 2014, Christie will be crisscrossing the country, supporting some of the party\u2019s brightest stars. But he\u2019ll also be introducing himself to those who know only the larger-than-life figure on TV. Christie: D.C. should tune into N.J. Was Christie's speech an announcement? Is a White House run next for Christie? \u201cI\u2019m going to be traveling all over the country trying to elect Republican governors and that\u2019s a pretty good thing to do for the Republican Party,\u201d Christie said Tuesday in an interview with CNN anchor and Chief Washington Correspondent Jake Tapper. The states that kick off the presidential primary and caucus calendar \u2013 Iowa, New Hampshire, South Carolina, Florida and Nevada \u2013 are among those holding elections next year. That itinerary works out well for someone who\u2019s got an eye on the White House. \u201cThe chairmanship of the RGA allows a governor to run for president before he actually runs for president, building relationships with organizers in key states and expanding his network of national contributors,\u201d said Alex Castellanos, a Republican strategist and veteran of numerous GOP campaigns. \u201cIt can also warehouse staff that can later move over to a presidential campaign. He can also use the RGA to collect chits by helping fellow GOP governors whom he hopes will eventually help him. It is a great platform for a Republican governor who is being urged to consider a presidential bid.\u201d But Christie could face intraparty sniping that he\u2019s using the position to further his chances of winning the party\u2019s presidential nomination. Then-Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney, who chaired the committee in 2006, ahead of his first run for the White House in 2008, and Texas Gov. Rick Perry, who chaired the RGA ahead of his 2012 bid for president, also got such quiet criticism. Already under attack Christie is touting his conservative credentials. \u201cI\u2019m a conservative,\u201d he said in his interview with Tapper, anchor of CNN\u2019s \u201cThe Lead with Jake Tapper,\u201d adding \u201cI\u2019ve governed as a conservative in this state.\u201d But a couple of high-profile Republicans are already trying to define Christie as not being conservative enough. Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, a favorite of tea party activists and a likely rival in 2016 should Christie decide to run, seemed to be trying to tag Christie with the m-word. \u201cI think the Republican Party is a big party, and we need moderates like Chris Christie who can win in New Jersey,\u201d Paul told Wolf Blitzer on Tuesday on \u201cThe Situation Room.\u201d \u201cWhat that means about the national party, I\u2019m not sure there\u2019s an answer. But we do need moderates like Chris Christie in the party.\u201d Paul also took a not-so-subtle jab Wednesday at Christie for starring in ads aimed at promoting tourism in New Jersey in the aftermath of Superstorm Sandy. In a Senate Homeland Security Committee hearing to review the federal response to last year\u2019s deadly storm, Paul questioned Housing and Urban Development Secretary Shaun Donovan about whether Sandy relief funds should be spent on television ads. Chris Christie's entire victory speech Why Chris Christie won in New Jersey Is Chris Christie preparing for 2016? Christie to Obama: 'Don't be so cute' Paul said that \u201cpeople running for office put their mug all over these ads while they are in the middle of a campaign. In New Jersey, $25 million was spent on ads that included somebody running for political office.\u201d \u201cYou think there might be a conflict of interest there? You know that\u2019s a real problem. That\u2019s why when people who are trying to do good and trying to use taxpayer dollars wisely they are offended to see our money spent on political ads. You know that\u2019s just offensive.\u201d And Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, another possible GOP candidate, seemed to suggest that the impact of Christie\u2019s landslide victory may be contained within the Garden State\u2019s borders. \u201cGovernor Christie has certainly shown he has a way of winning in New Jersey, in states like New Jersey \u2026 so I congratulate him on that,\u201d Rubio said in an interview with CNN Chief Congressional Correspondent Dana Bash. Rubio: Don\u2019t jump to conclusions about Christie\u2019s win Will Cain, a Republican analyst and CNN contributor, said he doesn\u2019t buy in to the idea that Christie is a moderate. \u201cLook, everyone is invested in defining Chris Christie as a moderate. Liberals want to ascribe his victory to a repudiation of conservatism. And his political rivals want to beat him in a primary. But I don\u2019t know that I can accept the premise,\u201d Cain said. \u201cHis greatest conservative sin is participating in Obamacare\u2019s Medicaid expansion. On everything else \u2013 guns, immigration \u2013 he\u2019s given lip service to moderation, not governed that way. An establishment Republican strategist said that infighting and sniping won\u2019t help the party with those it\u2019s trying to appeal to. \u201cThe best thing that anyone who has their eye on 2016 can do for themselves and the party right now is to work together, show the American people that Republicans can govern responsibly and work to make inroads with sections of the electorate that didn\u2019t support Republicans in the last two presidential elections,\u201d Brian Walsh, former National Republican Senatorial Committee communications director, told CNN. Ready to run? Christie\u2019s everywhere in the wake of his landslide re-election. The longtime Bruce Springsteen fan\u2019s on the cover of Time Magazine, with the headline \u201cBorn to Run\u201d on the story, and he\u2019s scheduled to do four of the five Sunday talk shows this weekend. Asked Wednesday by CNN\u2019s Debrorah Feyerick if all the talk about his potential bid for the White House is becoming a distraction, Christie pushed back, saying, \u201cI don\u2019t get distracted very easily. It takes a lot to distract me, and I think the way it won\u2019t be a distraction is I simply won\u2019t let it.\u201d Christie\u2019s re-election speech Tuesday night sounded like something more \u2013 the governor touted his bipartisan successes to an audience far beyond the Asbury Park ballroom and the borders of the Garden State. \u201cI know tonight a dispirited America, angry with their dysfunctional government in Washington, looks to New Jersey to say, \u2018Is what I think happening really happening? Are people really coming together? Are we really working, African-Americans and Hispanics, suburbanites and city dwellers, farmers and teachers? Are we really all working together?\u2019 Let me give the answer to everyone who is watching tonight: Under this government our first job is to get the job done, and as long as I\u2019m governor that job will always, always be finished,\u201d said Christie, to loud applause. What Christie\u2019s win says about 2016 Newt Gingrich, the former House speaker and current co-host of CNN\u2019s \u201cCrossfire,\u201d knows some things about running for the White House. \u201cI think it was an introductory speech,\u201d the one-time 2012 GOP frontrunner said. Castellanos added, It wasn\u2019t an acceptance speech, that was an announcement speech.\u201d Numbers to brag about Christie\u2019s victory was never in doubt. And as the polls in the Garden State closed Tuesday night, CNN and the other news networks rushed to project that the high-profile governor would win a second term in Trenton. But the big questions heading into Election Day 2013 were how large a victory Christie would capture over Barbara Buono, his little-known Democratic challenger, and how Christie would perform with voters who tend to cast ballots for Democrats. With just about all the ballots counted, Christie won 60% of the vote, the most by a Republican statewide in more than a quarter-century And according to CNN exit polls, Christie performed well with groups that the GOP needs to win if it wants to win national elections. Christie carried nearly six in 10 women and won all age groups other than those 18-29, which he just missed winning. Christie also won the Latino vote and took just more than a fifth of the African-American vote, a much better performance than most Republicans in recent elections. Christie also grabbed two-thirds of independents and a third of Democrats in a state where Democrats and independents made up nearly three-quarters of Tuesday\u2019s electorate. Christie, McAuliffe took different paths to victory The exit polls appear to bolster Christie\u2019s case that he\u2019s among the most electable of the potential GOP White House hopefuls heading into 2016. But if he runs for president, Christie will have to get through a battleground of conservative voters in the Republican primaries and caucuses similar to those he faced in blue-state New Jersey this year.

            "article_content": "There's no doubt Christie is mulling a run for president The big question will be whether he can get conservatives to support him Sen. Marco Rubio's prominent profile has led to complications for the potential 2016 contender The path to the White House is paved with former frontrunners \u2013 or maybe call them buzzleaders, since we\u2019re three years away from 2016 and nobody is officially running for president yet. Time magazine has put three different GOP lawmakers on its cover. First it was Marco Rubio. Then it was Rand Paul. Now it is Chris Christie. Don\u2019t forget to sprinkle that seasoning over all the sugary buzz surrounding Christie, who was emphatically reelected as New Jersey governor this week. The foreshadowing was evident as he sailed to victory and a second term. There\u2019s no doubt Christie is mulling a run for president. Tea Party hurt or help Christie in 2016? What's next for Chris Christie? Chris Christie in the national spotlight \u201cI know that if we can do this in Trenton, New Jersey, then maybe the folks in Washington, D.C., should tune in their TVs right now and see how it\u2019s done,\u201d he said during his victory speech, suggesting he had found the right mix to work together with Democrats and rise above partisan rancor. He was even more pointed with CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper when he suggested that Republicans have veered away from a winning path and onto an ideological one. Where does Christie go next? \u201cI think that the party\u2019s got to focus on winning again,\u201d Christie said from his campaign bus Tuesday, sending a clear message to conservative idealists and the tea party. \u201cYou know, sometimes, I feel like our party cares more about winning the argument than they care about winning elections. And if you don\u2019t win elections, you can\u2019t govern. And if you can\u2019t govern, you can\u2019t change the direction of a state, like we have done in New Jersey.\u201d The big question, assuming he does run for president, will be whether he can get conservatives he doesn\u2019t see eye-to-eye with to support him in order to get to a general election. The Christie narrative goes like this: The dynamic New Jersey Republican has flourished as a red governor in a blue state. He\u2019s defied unions and enacted conservative policies without doing something too drastic, the way Mitt Romney did with health insurance reform. He\u2019s shown a willingness to work with Democrats. He showed leadership after Superstorm Sandy. There\u2019s no doubt about it: Chris Christie won a huge victory Tuesday. And the way the media works these days, a big win for a governor like Christie makes him the odds-on favorite to be the Republican nominee for president in 2016, three years from now. Until he isn\u2019t. Wait for it. Or just ask Rubio about working across party lines in Washington. Rand Paul isn\u2019t much known for working with Democrats, but his buzz has faded lately as he\u2019s dealt with a plagiarism scandal. And he has competed with Sen. Ted Cruz for attention with the most conservative bulwarks of the party. When moderates fight back: GOP civil war could be brutal in 2014 elections Christie\u2019s relationship with social conservatives, a key GOP constituency, could be frustrated. He laid down his sword, for instance, when it became clear that courts would allow same-sex marriage in California. But conservatives in Iowa aren\u2019t ready to reject him simply because he lost the battle over same-sex marriage. \u201cHe accepted,  I\u2019ll say it, the position of gay  marriage existing in New Jersey,\u201d said Rep. Steve King, a Republican from the key state of Iowa. He said economic issues will be more important. \u201cWe\u2019ve had to make accommodations  for that in Iowa.  We have some experience with that. But he didn\u2019t endorse gay marriage.  And the tea party themselves, I\u2019ve been in many discussions with them and tried to argue to the contrary, they say we want to stay with the economic and the constitutional issues.  Not the social agenda.\u201d And don\u2019t forget: Romney, the Republicans\u2019 2012 presidential nominee, was governor of the first state to allow same-sex marriage when courts there OK\u2019d the practice back in 2004. Christie has got the cover of Time this week. Back in February, it was Rubio pictured confidently on the cover of that publication with the bold headline, \u201cThe Republican Savior: How Marco Rubio became the new voice of the GOP.\u201d Back then \u2013 just this past February \u2013 Rubio was the young senator with tea party credentials and a willingness to work across the aisle. The Rubio narrative is just as compelling as Christie\u2019s. The son of Cuban immigrants came to Washington on a tea party wave and staked his career on a bold and politically courageous effort to rewrite the nation\u2019s immigration laws. He sought to heal a perceived rift between Republicans and Latinos and bring millions of undocumented immigrants out of the shadows. It was a tortured process, but the Senate did, four months after Rubio was featured on the Time cover, pass 68-32 the immigration bill he helped write. It took mostly Democratic votes to do it, however. And Rubio\u2019s tea party cred was hurt. Election Night 2013: Christie wins big, Virginia provides drama Now that bill on which Rubio spent so much political capital is, as he told CNN\u2019s Dana Bash on Wednesday, \u201cstuck.\u201d And Rubio is the first to admit he has paid a political price with Republicans for working with Democrats and supporting a pathway to citizenship. \u201cI was in favor of immigration reform. It had nothing to do with politics of it, although it may have some political implications. It was because it was the right thing to do for our country.\u201d The more conservative House of Representatives won\u2019t touch Rubio\u2019s bipartisan bill, which has put him in the tough position of potentially having to support something less expansive in order to get anything done. \u201cWhat comprehensive bill on anything is going to get passed around here right now?\u201d he asked. \u201cWe can\u2019t even get a farm bill passed.\u201d Farm bills, FYI, are normally bipartisan and easily ratified. But not this year, with a stubborn Congress and a divisive president. \u201cPeople think Washington is gross,\u201d he said of the current atmosphere. Later, Rubio told Bash he doesn\u2019t yet know of any senators running for president (meaning him), but he hopes his experience in Washington won\u2019t be a permanent liability. \u201cYou can work in Washington without being of Washington,\u201d he said. \u201cLuckily, I haven\u2019t been here long enough to believe that what goes on here is normal.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Obamacare and immigration reform could boost Democrats for a generation or more Parties in power always try to use policy to secure future voter support Ideology aside, Republicans know health care, immigration reforms help Democrats GOP attacks focus on the health care law, not just website woes A \u201cbig f***ing deal\u201d has become an equally big fight, with Republicans relentlessly attacking President Barack Obama\u2019s signature health care reforms over the new reality they are bringing to the health insurance market. One reason is the GOP\u2019s ideological opposition to big government, as manifested by the health care overhaul intended to hold down rising costs that threaten U.S. fiscal stability. Another is the long-term political benefit to Obama and Democrats from the sweeping changes intended to give people previously unable to afford health insurance or deemed ineligible the chance to obtain coverage. Coupled with Obama\u2019s stated second-term priority \u2013 proposed immigration reform that would remove the \u201cillegal\u201d label for millions of undocumented aliens \u2013 the legislative power play could provide an electoral boost for Democrats certain to last a generation or longer. Panel: Obamacare roll out 'embarrassing' Like your health plan ... keep it? Obamacare sticker shock? Ayotte: 'Call a timeout' on Obamacare The combination of Obamacare \u2013 as the 2010 Affordable Care Act is known \u2013 and immigration reform \u201cwould be a huge boon to the Democratic Party,\u201d said Darrell West, the Brookings Institution\u2019s vice president and director of governance studies. \u201cIt would provide insurance to millions who don\u2019t currently have it, and it brings aboard undocumented people who are very likely to be Democratic supporters,\u201d he told CNN. Wendy Schiller, a political science professor at Brown University, said such an outcome is the goal of all presidents and their congressional allies who seek to \u201cenact policies that will hold their base and attract new voters in successive election cycles.\u201d Republicans know that, which explains their fierce opposition to Obamacare dating back to well before Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s off-color description whispered too loudly to Obama as the President prepared to sign the law in 2010. Now a confluence of factors \u2013 including the overall impact of the reforms as well as major problems in their implementation and continued GOP efforts to derail them \u2013 have further hardened already entrenched partisan positions on the issue. What\u2019s up with Obamacare and my health care? Effects of Obamacare It has taken more than three years since the Affordable Care Act became law to begin to understand its effects. The concept leans heavily on a conservative Republican idea adopted for the Massachusetts state health care program that creates large markets to hold down prices. To work, the program must include less-expensive young people to offset the higher costs of older people, who generally need more health care. Such a system would provoke competition between insurers for lucrative markets, meaning lower premiums and a minimum standard of benefits to provide security against financial ruin over a major illness or bad accident. However, an analysis by CNN found that consumer options vary significantly from state to state, and many Americans are discovering they have few options. For example, West Virginia and New Hampshire have one insurance company offering coverage, meaning no choice between providers, while eight other states \u2013 Alabama, Alaska, Hawaii, Maine, Mississippi, North Carolina, Vermont and Wyoming \u2013 have two. The Kaiser Family Foundation estimates that 12 million people live in counties with only one insurer, compared with 117 million in counties with more than five insurers. The foundation\u2019s Cynthia Cox found that in counties with more than five insurers, the average premium was about $20 a month less than in areas with only one insurer. In addition, CNN\u2019s Tom Foreman reported Thursday that in some cases, the same company will charge more for a policy in a rural area, compared with a big city. The differences generally reflect the smaller pool of consumers in less populous rural areas, compared with more densely populated urban and suburban areas. Such disparities also tend to follow a political fault line in many places, with Democrats more prevalent in big cities and suburbs, while Republicans generally get more support in rural areas. While definitive correlations would be overly simplistic and premature, increased options in urban areas versus rural areas indicate that on a broad level, more Democrats than Republicans are realizing benefits from Obamacare so far in terms of choice and cost. To Jonathan Gruber, a Massachusetts Institute of Technology professor who helped design  the Massachusetts and federal health care laws, it is too early to understand the full effects of Obamacare. \u201cIt\u2019s not like Obamacare\u2019s chasing insurers out\u201d of rural areas, Gruber told CNN on Thursday. \u201cThese are just markets that didn\u2019t have many insurers to choose from before, and there hasn\u2019t been a lot of entry in the recent times since the law has passed.\u201d In Massachusetts, he said, a major new provider entered the market two years after the reforms took effect. \u201cYou don\u2019t need 16 choices. You don\u2019t need 12 choices,\u201d Gruber said. \u201cIt\u2019s nice to have that many, but having one or two new entrants, which will happen over time \u2013 it did in Massachusetts \u2013 can really shake up the market in lower prices.\u201d GOP on insurance cancellations: \u2018We told you so\u2019 Botched website rollout Conservative critics long warned that Obamacare amounted to a government takeover of health care that would be too big to manage effectively and deny people the ability to choose their own doctor or coverage. So far, some of the predictions have proved true. While initial stages of implementation proved relatively uneventful, the biggest single step \u2013 the October 1 launch of exchanges to give people the chance to buy required health coverage \u2013 was badly botched when the government website proved dysfunctional. The administration scrambled to try to get it working, announcing a \u201ctech surge\u201d with outside experts deployed to bolster the joint government-private sector team that created HealthCare.gov. In addition, insurers recently began informing some of the relatively small percentage of people who buy their own health coverage, instead of getting it through their employer or government-run Medicare and Medicaid, that their policies were being discontinued or changed because they failed to comply with Obamacare requirements. The shift undermined Obama\u2019s mantra-like pledge in selling the reforms that no one would be forced to change policies or doctors they liked. Obama \u201chas broken many promises about Obamacare,\u201d Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus said in a prepared statement Friday that solicited stories from people about how they were hurt by Obamacare. On Monday, the RNC announced it was launching a campaign of robocalls and targeted Facebook posts to encourage people to ask why their elected representatives supported what it called \u201cObama\u2019s lie that people could keep their healthcare plans under ObamaCare.\u201d At the White House on Friday, spokesman Jay Carney emphasized that the individual policies being discontinued or changed represented a fraction of the overall U.S. population. He reiterated the administration line that consumers would get a better deal under Obamacare \u2013 more benefits at what likely will be a lower price than they pay now if they qualify for federal subsidies available under the reforms. For many, Obama\u2019s promise of health care choice does not ring true Early figures The latest battle line between the parties is about early enrollment figures. Republicans are pushing the administration to release numbers for how many signed up in the first month of the new exchanges, but Carney and others say complete and reliable information will only be available by mid-November. Rep. Dave Camp of Michigan, the GOP chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, has threatened to subpoena information on enrollment figures as soon as this week. Carney and other officials have said they expect the initial figures to be low, because of the website problems and a cautious approach by consumers in the early days of such programs. He and others note that the Massachusetts health care plan had most people sign up in the final days before the enrollment deadline, and they expect the same thing to happen with the federal program. That deadline is March 31. Gruber of MIT called the focus on the early figures premature. \u201cAccording to the Congressional Budget Office, it will be about a three-year ramp-up period until Obamacare is fully effective at its full level of functioning,\u201d he said. \u2018\u201cThat\u2019s what we saw in Massachusetts as well. So we need to just calm down and stop worrying about days and weeks and focus instead on months and years.\u201d However, Gruber warned that the HealthCare.gov website must be fully operational by the end of November to ensure that people being forced to change policies have time to enroll by January 1, when their current coverage ends. The Republican goal in demanding the figures is to depict Obamacare as an immediate failure in order to try to generate public momentum for delaying or dismantling the law. Some Democrats facing tough re-election battles next year also have proposed a delay to allow people more time to sign up and avoid the fine, but the Obama administration opposes such a step because it would undermine the immediate creation of large new markets needed to keep costs down. 5 things we learned from Sebelius Obamacare hearing The immigration connection Even if Obamacare works as planned, Gruber told CNN, about 40% of people currently uninsured would remain without coverage. As many as a half of that group \u2013 10 million or so \u2013 would be undocumented immigrants living illegally in the country, he said. \u201cToday, these undocumented immigrants end up in the emergency room. Next year, they\u2019ll end up in the emergency room again,\u201d he said. \u201cThat may be something we want to take on eventually as a society, but we don\u2019t seem prepared to do so now.\u201d To West of the Brookings Institute, the Obamacare and immigration issues \u201cdo intersect in interesting ways.\u201d He noted the Affordable Care Act specifically excludes undocumented immigrants from getting health insurance under the reforms. A Senate-passed immigration reform proposal would give temporary legal status to the undocumented, but make them wait 10 years before they could seek citizenship. It is unclear if the plan will get a vote in the Republican-led House. The decade of waiting to seek citizenship should ease the fears of Republicans over an immediate impact on elections, as only U.S. citizens can vote, West said. However,  any undocumented immigrants who eventually become citizens would probably be Democrats, because \u201cthey\u2019ve seen Democrats have been the people pushing for immigration reform while Republicans have been resistant,\u201d he added. Schiller, the Brown University political science professor, said the issue of Obamacare eligibility could be a sticking point in the immigration reform debate, adding: \u201cRepublicans will absolutely insist that (undocumented immigrants) are not eligible for Obamacare during that 10-year-period\u201d before they can seek citizenship.

            "article_content": "Republicans stood united after a long fight that shut down the government GOP likely to stay united on common themes of taxes and spending Some issues -- immigration and Obamacare -- could continue to divide the party In a large conference-style room in the basement of the U.S. Capitol, Republican members of the House, exhausted from more than two weeks of battling on the shutdown and debt ceiling crisis, met for one last time. They met in a room that had often been filled with contentious debate, snickering rebels, quiet observers and frustrated moderators. But on the night the House voted to reopen the government, the mood was different. They knew it was over. They could fight no more. They had lost. But, even in defeat, many who were in the room say there was a surprising feeling of unity. On that night, 16 days into their failed strategy, the diverse group of Republicans who have had sharp differences on how to push a Republican agenda in a Democratic led government stood as one. Could the Democrats retake the House? Analysis: Tea Party caucus like vampires Shutdown is over... what's next? Is the Republican brand damaged? House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Virginia, spoke passionately in the GOP conference room, urging his members to unify. And it worked. Embattled Speaker of the House John Boehner received a standing ovation. The unusual plea for unity was a recognition that the last few weeks had been, to say the least, bruising for the GOP. The government shutdown exposed major divisions in the party. During the summer, the far right tea party wing had backed Boehner into a corner by demanding he link defunding the Affordable Care Act, also known as Obamacare, to the shutdown and debt ceiling. Meanwhile, what was left of the Republican moderates in the House and Senate \u2013 in fact much of the more realistic GOP center \u2013 had privately thought the tactic would lead to political disaster. Obama may have won now, but the next three years could be tough And they ended up being right. \u201cI think we have fully now acquainted our new members with what a losing strategy that is,\u201d Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky told The Hill. Taking names and moving on \u2026 On some issues, Republicans are likely to motivate around common themes. As talks with Democratic leaders get underway on a budget, Republicans are likely to stand against any effort to raise taxes and will push for lower government spending and changes to entitlement programs. And Republicans have turned their attention to another aspect of Obamacare: its chief implementer, Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius. The GOP is calling for her resignation over its botched rollout. Congressional fight over Obamacare turns to website woes While the Republicans stood united in the face of defeat, the day-to-day realities are going to prove much more difficult. The President is already pushing Congress to get started on immigration reform, which the Senate already passed. Immigration has long been a contentious subject within the Republican Party. Some members are opposed to any liberalization of immigration laws while others, including former President George W. Bush, have pushed the party to embrace a comprehensive overhaul. What's next for the GOP GOP fractures after shutdown showdown Insurers suffer Obamacare site glitches \u2026 But not entirely united In the two days after that showing of unity, fractures are already forming. McConnell said this week that he will not allow another partial government shutdown. \u201cOne of my favorite old Kentucky sayings is there\u2019s no education in the second kick of a mule,\u201d he told the Hill newspaper. \u201cThere will not be a government shutdown.\u201d But an aide to Texas Sen. Ted Cruz said he had a different point of view. The aide told CNN\u2019s Dana Bash that he has not ruled out any future efforts to shutdown the government in the fight against Obamacare. Additionally, Cruz blamed his Republican Senate colleagues for losing the fight. \u201cUnfortunately, the Senate chose not to follow the House. And in particular, we saw real division among the House of Representatives. That was unfortunate. I would point out that had Senate Republicans united, and supported House Republicans, the outcome of this, I believe, would\u2019ve been very, very different,\u201d Cruz told CNN\u2019s Dana Bash. While Cruz gained national attention \u2013 and much condemnation \u2013 for his fight, his support among tea party activists has skyrocketed to 74%. But at the same time, support for the tea party declined with only 30% of Republicans viewing the coalition favorably, according to Pew Research Center. Poll: Tea Party\u2019s favorable numbers take a hit It\u2019s a paradigm Republicans have to consider as they hope to maintain control of the House and obtain control of the Senate in the 2014 elections and win the White House in 2016. That\u2019s something with which McConnell, a political veteran, is well aware. \u201cFull-scale repeal is obviously something that\u2019s not going to be achievable until I\u2019m the majority leader of the Senate and we have a new president,\u201d he told the Hill, referring to a repeal of Obamacare. But McConnell has a tough re-election of his own. And conservative activists are not pleased with his role in negotiating a deal to reopen the government. The Senate Conservative Fund, a group dedicated to electing conservative members of the Senate, endorsed his challenger, Matt Bevin, Friday morning. Government shutdown: Sorry, we're closed The schism continues One of the lawmakers who backed the strategy to defund Obamacare, Rep. Ted Yoho of Florida, said that the fight was worth it. \u201cIf we don\u2019t address it today, when are we going to address it?\u201d he rhetorically asked on CNN\u2019s \u2018Erin Burnett OutFront.\u201d But on the same program, fellow Republican Rep. Michael Grimm of New York said the GOP is \u201ca big party,\u201d adding that a lot of members believe in being \u201cpragmatic and reasonable,\u201d noting that the strategy to dismantle Obamacare was neither. In defeat, Boehner may live to fight another day As politicians often look for political advantage, Obama highlighted the Republican divisions. \u201cWe shouldn\u2019t fail to act on areas that we do agree or could agree just because it\u2019s bad politics, just because the extremes in our party don\u2019t like the word compromise,\u201d he said Thursday. Boehner, who has spent the last two-and-a-half years trying to corral his party on a host of issues, knows full well the difficulty of uniting the party. \u201cBecause we\u2019re Republicans, we\u2019re a little more independent-minded than our friends across the aisle,\u201d Boehner told WLW radio Wednesday. \u201cSome are a little bit more independent-minded than others.\u201d 15 winners and losers from the shutdown crisis Republican shutdown pain may boost Dems in 2014 Stenographer rants on House floor CNN\u2019s Dana Bash contributed to this report",

            "article_content": "President Obama says nation can't \"degenerate into hatred\" Republican split on display after shutdown debacle The government is funded through January 15 and the debt ceiling through February 7 NEW: Aide to Ted Cruz says Senator not ruling anything in or out on another possible shutdown Is it a model for bipartisan governance or a short-term solution that only hardened long-held positions? Democrats and Republicans had wildly different takes on Thursday on the agreement passed by Congress and signed by President Barack Obama that ended the 16-day partial shutdown of the government and averted a possible U.S. default. Hundreds of thousands of federal workers returned to their jobs across the country and national monuments such as the Gateway Arch in St. Louis reopened under the agreement considered a victory for Obama because it lacked substantive changes to his signature health care reforms targeted by conservatives. In a tough and somber statement, the President challenged the Republican right to drop its anti-government ideology and change how business gets done in Washington. Obama, GOP in parallel political world GOP fractures after shutdown showdown Obama: No winners after shutdown ends Obama: Need willing helpers for progress The standoff \u201cinflicted completely unnecessary damage (to) our economy\u201d by slowing growth and increasing borrowing costs, Obama said, declaring that \u201cthere are no winners here.\u201d At the same time, he blamed the brinksmanship that flirted with the first default in U.S. history on no-compromise tactics of the Republican tea party wing in Congress, saying that \u201cthe American people are completely fed up with Washington.\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s work together to make government work better instead of treating it like an enemy or purposely making it work worse,\u201d Obama said in a direct jab at tea party conservatives. \u201cYou don\u2019t like a particular policy or a particular president? Then argue for your position. Go out there and win an election,\u201d he added. \u201cPush to change it, but don\u2019t break it\u201d because \u201cthat\u2019s not being faithful to what this country\u2019s about.\u201d Saying \u201cwe can\u2019t degenerate into hatred,\u201d he ended by quoting part of the Pledge of Allegiance that states America is \u201cone nation, under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.\u201d But an aide to Sen. Ted Cruz, who led the tea party charge to tie continued government funding to derailing Obamacare, told CNN\u2019s Dana Bash late on Thursday the Texas Republican was not ruling anything in or out about a possible shutdown early next year around the next big fiscal deadlines. While no other Republican leaders offered on-the-record reaction, a senior GOP congressional aide told Bash that \u201cthe President\u2019s comments are not designed to help this process, only to lay blame in advance\u201dof upcoming congressional battles over the budget, immigration reform and other issues. The congressional stalemate ended when Republicans caved to the insistence of Obama and Democrats that legislation funding the government and raising the federal borrowing limit should be free \u2013 or at least mostly free \u2013 from partisan issues and tactics. After all the bickering and grandstanding, the billions lost and trust squandered, the result amounted to much ado about nothing. Hardline Republicans, whose opposition to Obama\u2019s signature health care reforms set the shutdown and debt ceiling crisis in motion, got pretty much zip \u2013 except maybe marred reputations. \u201cTo say we as Republicans left a lot on the table would be one of the biggest understatements in American political history,\u201d Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina tweeted. The agreement amounted to the cliched kicking of the can down the road, because the deal passed by Congress in lightning fashion Wednesday night and signed by Obama in the wee hours of Thursday only funds the government through January 15 and raises the debt ceiling until February 7. Read the bill It also set up budget negotiations between the GOP-led House and Democratic-led Senate intended to reach a broader agreement on funding the government for the fiscal year that ends on September 30. Ideally, a budget compromise would ensure government funding and include deficit reduction provisions that would prevent another round of default-threatening brinksmanship in three months\u2019 time. Did Sen. Ted Cruz destroy the GOP? House Republicans support Boehner Congress passes deal to end shutdown Woman escorted from House floor Government: Back in business Dialogue started On Thursday, leaders of the House and Senate budget committees \u2013 Republican Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin and Democratic Sen. Patty Murray of Washington \u2013 held a symbolic breakfast to get the dialogue started. They noted that their negotiations \u2013 called a conference between their two committees to work out differences in budgets passed by each chamber \u2013 differed from a special committee set up under 2011 legislation that failed to agree on broader deficit reduction steps. \u201cChairman Ryan knows I\u2019m not gonna vote for his budget. I know that he\u2019s not gonna vote for mine,\u201d Murray told reporters, saying the goal was to find \u201cthe common ground between our two budgets that we both can vote on.\u201d In his statement to reporters Thursday, Obama repeated his call for Congress to now take a \u201cbalanced approach\u201d on a budget for the rest of the current fiscal year that would \u201ccut out things we don\u2019t need,\u201d \u201cclose corporate tax loopholes that don\u2019t create jobs,\u201d and \u201cfree up resources for things that do help the country grow,\u201d like research and infrastructure. He also said Congress should pass immigration reforms proposed by the Senate and complete work on a farm bill caught in partisan wrangling. White House spokesman Jay Carney said the House vote to pass the spending and debt ceiling agreement Wednesday showed the possibility of bipartisan governance, with the Democratic minority joined by enough Republicans to surpass the 217-vote threshold required. However, that outcome only came under immense pressure on House Republicans after their partisan proposals seeking to link provisions dismantling or defunding Obamacare were rejected by the Democratic-led Senate and the President. House Speaker John Boehner\u2019s spokesman said the Ohio Republican sought a \u201cstep-by-step\u201d process to address the immigration issue, which was Washington code for rejecting Obama\u2019s comprehensive approach that would offer immigrants living illegally in the country a pathway to legal status. Conservatives call that amnesty, and a senior GOP aide told CNN that \u201cthe President\u2019s attitude and actions over the past few weeks have almost certainly poisoned the well on immigration, at least for now.\u201d Why is Ted Cruz smiling? Back to work Before Obama spoke Thursday, federal employees returning to work got muffins from Vice President Joe Biden and hugs from colleagues, along with eye rolls about their \u201cvacation\u201d due to the shutdown. \u201cI am happy it\u2019s ended,\u201d Biden said when he arrived at the Environmental Protection Agency with the muffins handed out to returning workers. \u201cIt was unnecessary to begin with.\u201d In the basement of the Capitol, there were exuberant hugs as furloughed colleagues were welcomed back, but there was also bitterness toward the elected legislators in charge upstairs. A common refrain was the sarcastic question: \u201cHow was your vacation?\u201d Responses were often nonverbal \u2013 an eye roll, a head shake, an angry glare, the occasional ironic laugh. Zakaria: Conservatives should lighten up Had Congress not approved a debt limit increase, the government would have lost its authority to borrow more money to pay all of its bills. Social Security checks and veterans\u2019 benefits could have stopped. The markets could have gone into a tailspin. Approval of the temporary spending plan meant the return to work of more than 800,000 furloughed employees, while more than 1 million others who\u2019ve been working without pay will get paychecks again. A provision in the agreement guaranteed back pay for government workers for the shutdown. What\u2019s open for business again Last-minute save However, the measure doesn\u2019t address many of the contentious and complicated issues that continue to divide Democrats and Republicans, such as changes to entitlement programs and tax reform. \u201cWe think that we\u2019ll be back here in January debating the same issues,\u201d John Chambers, managing director of Standard and Poor\u2019s rating service, told CNN on Wednesday night. \u201cThis is, I fear, a permanent feature of our budgetary process.\u201d At the White House, Carney hoped the outcome of the shutdown showdown \u2013 with Republicans getting little in return for the public anger leveled mostly at them for causing it \u2013 would revise how things worked. \u201cIt\u2019s a new day, and maybe that dynamic will change,\u201d he said. Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, credited with brokering the agreement with his Democratic counterpart, Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada, said in published interviews Thursday there would be no further government shutdowns. Pork in the bill: The 5 most surprising provisions in the debt deal A $24 billion battle The partial government shutdown came at a steep cost. Standard and Poor\u2019s estimated it took a $24 billion bite out of the economy. Then there\u2019s the impact it had on politicians\u2019 image. If there\u2019s one thing polls showed that Americans agreed on, it\u2019s that they don\u2019t trust Congress \u2013 with Republicans bearing more blame than anyone else for what transpired. What did GOP win on Obamacare? Not much While some Republicans, such as tea party favorite Cruz, claimed moral victories in energizing their movement, Boehner didn\u2019t even pretend his side came out victorious. \u201cWe fought the good fight; we just didn\u2019t win,\u201d Boehner told a radio station in his home state of Ohio. Cruz, despite being in the Senate, is credited with spearheading the House Republican effort to attach amendments that would have dismantled or defunded Obamacare. Republicans did get a small Obamacare concession: requiring the government to confirm the eligibility of people receiving federal subsidies under the health care program. However, Republican leaders said dismantling or defunding Obamacare was never going to happen and they criticized Cruz and his tea party cohorts for essentially causing the unpopular shutdown over that effort.

            "article_content": "President Obama emerged with an ambitious agenda moving forward He implored Congress that their working relationship \"has to change\" One former member says the relationship can't get much lower The morning that the federal government reopened after 16 days of political stalemate, President Barack Obama stood at the podium in the State Dining Room of The White House. He didn\u2019t smile. \u201cThose of us who have the privilege to serve this country have an obligation to do our job as best we can. We come from different parties, but we are Americans first,\u201d he said. He then chastised Republican lawmakers, blaming them for the shutdown and drama over the debt ceiling that he called \u201ccompletely unnecessary\u201d and said damaged \u201cour economy.\u201d Fresh from what most are calling an undisputed political victory over the conservatives, the President didn\u2019t seem in a conciliatory mood. His body language said it all: Enough already. A long history, a strained relationship GOP fractures after shutdown showdown What's next for the GOP Obama warms up for next round Obama has more than three years left in his presidency and the next battle is just months away because the deal approved by Congress that he signed only funds the government through early January and only extends U.S. borrowing authority until early February. From his bully pulpit on Thursday, Obama invoked his professorial tone and implored Congress that their working relationship \u201chas to change.\u201d \u201cBecause we\u2019ve all got a lot of work to do on behalf of the American people and that includes the hard work of regaining their trust,\u201d Obama said. This episode was only the latest in a series of confrontations between the President and Congress. To say that his relationship with the legislative branch has been strained might be the political understatement of the decade. A deal for now, but this year\u2019s been a legislative dud for Obama The biggest battle was over Obamacare, which passed the Democratic-controlled Congress in 2010.  But the past year alone has seen fierce wrangling over the administration\u2019s response to the deadly terror attack in September 2012 on the U.S. diplomatic mission in Benghazi, Libya. And there was the major fiscal cliff impasse over budget cuts and tax increases last March and in the first excruciating battle over spending and the debt limit in the summer of 2011. There has also been tension over Syria and Iran. \u2018Bottom of the barrel\u2019 Obama: No winners after shutdown ends Obama: Need willing helpers for progress The shutdown's biggest loser is ... McCain: Government won't shut down again While he said \u201cthere are no winners,\u201d Obama used the moment to press his agenda. He urged Congress to determine the government\u2019s spending and priorities for 2014 and beyond. He also urged lawmakers to pass an overdue farm bill that sets the country\u2019s farming priorities and pays for food assistance. He wants the House to take up the immigration reform bill, which the Senate passed earlier this year, and has called for a return to \u201cregular order,\u201d where Congress approves budgets, reconciles differences and gets things done. Playing nice: Budget talks may start with an extra-friendly tone \u201cThe American people are completely fed up with Washington,\u201d he said, reflecting polls that show support for Congress at historic lows. It\u2019s an ambitious agenda, especially for a government fresh off a debilitating few weeks and tensions between the two branches are high and trust is low. One former Democratic member of Congress, Dan Glickman, who represented Kansas for 18 years and currently sits on the political reform commission at the Bipartisan Policy Center, said that the shutdown showdown brought about one bright spot. \u201cI think we may have reached the bottom of the barrel,\u201d meaning things in Washington \u201ccan\u2019t get any lower than this,\u201d he said. In defeat, Boehner may live to fight another day But former House Speaker Newt Gingrich disagreed. He said the most conservative members who wanted to gut Obamacare in exchange for government funding got little out of the budget deal are even more incensed. \u201cThey will be more embittered, more angry. They will find more ways to go after Obama because they can\u2019t find any way to get him to negotiate,\u201d he said. Gingrich\u2019s statement rings true if Rep. Raul Labrador, R-Idaho, accurately represents his like-minded colleagues. He told the Huffington Post that he thinks immigration reform is dead. \u201cFor us to go to a negotiation, to the negotiating table with President Obama after what he has done over the last two and a half weeks, I think would be probably a very big mistake,\u201d Labrador said. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi didn\u2019t mince words Thursday morning. She said the Republicans\u2019 \u201ctemper tantrum\u201d cost the economy $24 billion. \u2018That\u2019s democracy\u2019 Government: Back in business Government shutdown: Sorry, we're closed From his lectern, Obama tried to sound like the adult in the room. \u201cDemocrats and Republicans are far apart on a lot of issues and I recognize there are folks on the other side who think that my policies are misguided,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s putting it mildly. That\u2019s okay. That\u2019s democracy. That\u2019s how it work.\u201d While he offered out his hand for future negotiations, Obama didn\u2019t stay completely above the fray. In the same sentence he blamed one faction of the Republican Party for the latest dysfunction, insisting that their goal is to cause chaos. \u201cLet\u2019s work together to make government work better instead of treating it like an enemy or purposely making it work worse,\u201d Obama said. Why is Ted Cruz smiling? Understanding that he needs the Republican Party to get anything done in Washington, he separated the party into two factions and implored the more rebellious to stay in line. \u201cYou don\u2019t like a particular policy or a particular president? Then argue for your position. Go out there and win an election. Push to change it but don\u2019t break it. Don\u2019t break what our predecessors spent over two centuries building. That\u2019s not being faithful to what this country is about,\u201d he said. McConnell: Further shutdowns \u2018off the table\u2019 Republican congressman: It was worth the fight While Obama tried to highlight the rifts in the Republican Party, perhaps hoping to exploit the divisions and then conquer, Republicans appeared united, at least for a few hours Wednesday night. Moments before the House was set to vote on a deal to reopen the government, House Speaker John Boehner received a standing ovation, even from his most vocal Republican critics. And one of those critics, Rep. Justin Amash, R-Michigan, said Boehner\u2019s leadership through the latest battle has been \u201cfantastic.\u201d Then Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, put a damper on that party. \u201cThis was a terrible idea. I told you at the beginning how it was going to end. We know if they try it again how it\u2019s going to end. So hopefully, they won\u2019t try to do this again, at least not in my lifetime,\u201d McCain said.",

Instead, even with Wednesday\u2019s debt ceiling and government funding deal, this is a wasted year in Washington, one of more band-aid budgeting, polarized partisanship and Republican chaos. Yes, public opinion polls suggest the government shutdown and debt ceiling crisis is more damaging to Republicans than to the President and his fellow Democrats. And Obama gives up little in the deal struck Wednesday to fund the government through January and raise the debt ceiling through early February. Kicking the can down the road Congress passes deal to end shutdown Sen. McCain on the end of the shutdown But with precious time in his second term ticking by, it is safe to say the President is losing even as he may \u201cwin\u201d the short-term political blame game. In defeat, Boehner may live to fight another day Consider the priorities laid out in his February State of the Union Address: *A new jobs plan *Infrastructure investments targeting roads and the 70,000 American bridges he noted are deemed structurally unsound *An increase, to $9 an hour, in the federal minimum wage *A guarantee of quality pre-school education for every child in America *New background checks for gun purchases and, the President asked, for an up or down vote on new gun restrictions, including a ban on certain assault style weapons *Plus sweeping immigration reform, including, in his words, \u201ca reasonable pathway to earned citizenship.\u201d Also in his address: a plea to end the budgeting by brinksmanship and crisis and a hopeful call for bipartisan negotiations on tax reform and Medicare and other entitlement spending. Eight months later \u2013 as the end of that critical first year of the presidential term comes into focus \u2013 none of those priorities has been realized. Not one. Nine things we missed during the shutdown And Washington\u2019s dysfunction appears to be only deepening, as differences between Democrats and Republicans are often overshadowed by the internal civil war within the GOP. Don\u2019t count on that environment improving once Washington stumbles its way past this latest crisis. The deal provides a temporary fix - essentially kicking the can down the road to January and February to give Congress and the White House time to negotiate. A welcome respite, perhaps, but the issues won\u2019t get any easier over the course of those three or four months, and the politics - believe it or not - could get even more difficult because those new deadlines are early in the midterm election year. Republican shutdown pain may boost Dems in 2014",

Ted Cruz takes on hecklers; Marco Rubio appears, trying to improve conservative support They didn\u2019t get the memo. Seven months after the national Republican Party issued a report exhorting the GOP to \u201cstop talking to itself\u201d and appeal to minorities and swing voters, conservatives banded together on Friday in a defiant show of unity against the party\u2019s political pragmatists. Top conservatives rally at summit in Washington At the opening session of the Values Voter Summit, a yearly gathering of social conservatives in Washington sponsored by the Family Research Council, a procession of conservative leaders urged their most dedicated supporters to stand firm on principle and defend their values in the face of calls for moderation. Q & A: Tony Perkins \u201cThey say we have to reach out beyond our conservative base,\u201d said Utah Sen. Mike Lee, a driving force behind the movement on Capitol Hill to dismantle the Affordable Care Act. \u201cI think they make a great point. Times have changed. We do have to broaden our appeal and we do have to change the way we talk about the family. But ultimately the critics have it backwards. It isn\u2019t that conservatives focus too much on the family, but far too little.\u201d The summit, with its made-for-Twitter rhetorical broadsides, had the effect of making the Republican National Committee\u2019s \u201cGrowth And Opportunity Project\u201d \u2013 a post-election project commissioned by the RNC to examine why the party failed in 2012 and how to win in the future \u2013 seem like a quaint and distant memory. See Sen. Ted Cruz take on hecklers Carson: Obamacare as bad as slavery Rep. King: Real RINO is Ted Cruz Cruz: I do support health care overhaul Jones to Cruz: Do you owe GOP apology? Besides calling on GOP leaders to modernize their broken election turnout machinery, and to back comprehensive immigration reform in a bid to win over Hispanic voters, the authors of the so-called \u201cautopsy\u201d report warned Republicans against cocooning themselves in a conservative thought bubble. \u201cInstead of driving around in circles on an ideological cul-de-sac, we need a party whose brand of conservatism invites and inspires new people to visit us,\u201d the RNC report said. \u201cOur standard should not be universal purity; it should be a more welcoming conservatism.\u201d The crowd at the Omni Shoreham Hotel \u2013 comprised of roughly 2,000 paying participants, an organizer said \u2013 represents only a small slice of the GOP coalition. But events like this one can serve as a barometer of right-leaning sentiment and provide a nationally-televised platform for some of the conservative movement\u2019s most controversial voices.  They did not pull punches. A roster of conservative speakers savaged the GOP establishment \u2013 including Arizona Sen. John McCain, the party\u2019s onetime presidential nominee \u2013 as traitors to the cause. \u201cThe old bulls will not act on our behalf,\u201d warned Mark Levin, the radio host. Louie Gohmert, a tea party aligned congressman from Texas, even accused McCain, a noted foreign policy hawk, of supporting al Qaeda. A band of protesters demanding immigration reform were angrily shouted down by the audience and called \u201crabid\u201d by Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, the reigning hero of the tea party movement. Dogged by hecklers, Cruz hits back Radio host Sandy Rios cast doubt on the story of the killing of Matthew Shepard, saying the gay University of Wyoming student was brutally murdered in 1998 not because of his sexuality, but because of \u201ca drug deal gone bad.\u201d And one of the conservative movement\u2019s most provocative orators, the neurosurgeon Ben Carson, called Obamacare \u201cthe worst thing that has happened in this nation since slavery\u201d \u2013 a claim that was met with loud applause. Is there a way out of stalemate? Obamacare glitches continue Obamacare website woes The conference was chock full of the kind of flame-throwing rhetoric that elicits groans from the GOP consultant class on Capitol Hill, who fret that their chances of winning national elections are being crippled by a class of emboldened tea party upstarts who can win Republican primaries but do little to broaden the party\u2019s appeal to women, young voters and Hispanics. Supporters stand by representatives \u2013 and government shutdown Just 24% of Americans have a positive view of the Republican Party, a Wall Street Journal/NBC News survey revealed on Thursday \u2013 an all-time low for the GOP \u2013 and only 21% had a positive view of the tea party movement. Polls: No winners, but a bigger loser Despite the tea party\u2019s toxic brand, a number of Republicans who may seek the presidency in 2016, including Cruz, Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul and Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, took a breather from shutdown negotiations to deliver remarks at the conference \u2013 an effort to court the kind of voters who hold great sway inside the GOP nominating process. Cruz, who has emerged as the most visible conservative foil to President Barack Obama during the spending showdown, was greeted with a standing ovation after being introduced by the writer L. Brent Bozell. He whipped up the audience with a pointed attack on McCain, who has asked conservatives to stand down on using Obamacare as a bargaining tactic. Crossfire: Cruz defends tactics that led to shutdown Cruz is Dems\u2019 new bogeyman Lowdown on the shutdown in 3 minutes Government shutdown: Sorry, we're closed Photos: Texas junior Senator Ted Cruz Bozell accused Republican leaders in the House and Senate of \u201ctrying to destroy\u201d Cruz and \u201chis crusade to save America.\u201d After Cruz began talking about the need to stop the \u201cnightmare\u201d of the Affordable Care Act, his speech was repeatedly interrupted. About a dozen protestors screamed at him from the audience, asking him why he opposes a pathway to citizenship for illegal immigrants. Cruz voted against the sweeping immigration overhaul passed by the Senate last summer, a bill now stalled in the House. The protestors, representing a handful of immigration reform advocacy groups, were jeered by the audience and escorted out of the hotel by security guards. Cruz accused them of being \u201crabid political operatives\u201d sent by the White House. Only moments later, Rubio, a Cuban-American who is the face of GOP efforts to overhaul the nation\u2019s immigration laws, made it through an inspirational speech hailing the greatness of America without any mention of the immigration bill that he helped advance though the Senate. Rubio\u2019s once-sterling reputation among conservatives was sullied by the immigration effort, and he has spent the last several months trying to repair his standing on the right. Multiple speakers urged House Republican leaders not to abandon Obamacare as a bargaining chip in the spending stalemate that led to a government shutdown almost two weeks ago, even though House Speaker John Boehner and his deputies in Congress appear on the verge of doing so, in pursuit of other spending reductions. GOP congressman: Defunding Obamacare \u2018off the table\u2019 Navarrette: Cruz is right about Obamacare Borger: Goodbye to the strategy Republicans knew was a fantasy Wisconsin Rep. Paul Ryan, the House Budget Chairman behind the GOP\u2019s new plan to end the stalemate by pursuing reforms to entitlements and the tax code rather than health care de-funding, opted not to step into the den of anti-Obamacare fervor.

            "article_content": "NEW: Senate Republican leader McConnell will vote to end a GOP filibuster The Senate takes up a House spending plan that defunds Obamacare GOP conservatives threaten a filibuster over restoring funds for health care reforms Congress must authorize new government spending by October 1 \u201cGovernment shutdown looms,\u201d blare the headlines and news anchors as Congress lurches toward another stalemate over how to spend tax dollars. Before you wonder about that Social Security check or selling off your stock portfolio in advance of a possible market crash, consider a couple of political realities in the current debate over spending, Obamacare and the economy. First, there is a week to go before the deadline for Congress to either authorize more government spending for a new fiscal year that begins October 1 or trigger a partial shutdown of government services. In Washington, a week is like an NFL triple-header \u2013 a seemingly endless stream of mindless commercial breaks with a few bursts of furious action and momentum swings. Anyone who predicts a shutdown with certainty a week ahead of time is messing with your head. Can lawmakers avoid government shutdown? Clock ticking to government shutdown Sen. Ted Cruz's war on Obamacare Government's latest shutdown showdown Second, all that political rhetoric and bluster is exactly that \u2013 a bunch of words and posturing meant to bolster positions on either side of the debate. At this point, the congressional machinations in coming days are fairly clear, despite what one side or the other tries to portray as the right thing to do. On NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d on Sunday, four members of Congress \u2013 two from each party \u2013 were asked if there would be a shutdown. All answered no. Third, this is all really about elections, like everything in Washington. In this case, legislators eyeing next year\u2019s congressional elections and the 2016 presidential vote are trying to appeal to their political bases more than actually working for a compromise solution. So what do we know will happen? 10 ways a government shutdown would affect your daily life First Act The Democratic-led Senate kicks off the week of legislative brinksmanship by taking up a spending plan passed Friday by the Republican-led House that strips all funding for President Barack Obama\u2019s health care reforms. A conservative GOP wing bullied Speaker John Boehner of Ohio to include the provision defunding Obamacare in the House spending measure, known in congressional jargon as a continuing resolution. Those tea party conservatives seek to destroy or at least weaken the health care reforms of the Obamacare law passed in 2010 and held up as constitutional by the Supreme Court in 2012. They face fierce opposition from Obama and Democrats, who want to protect the president\u2019s signature legislative accomplishment so far. Because Republicans control the House, they were able to pass the spending plan contingent on defunding Obamacare by a 230-189 margin, with all but two \u201cyes\u201d votes from Republicans and all but one \u201cno\u201d vote from Democrats. In the Senate, however, Democrats and their two independent allies hold 54 of the 100 seats. Now, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada plans to remove the provision that defunds Obamacare from the House spending plan and send it back to Boehner. While conservatives led by Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas threaten a filibuster to force a 60-vote majority to proceed, several prominent Republican senators oppose forcing a government shutdown by attaching the Obamacare issue to the spending plan. Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky said Monday he will vote to overcome a filibuster attempt, guaranteeing such an effort by Cruz would fail as predicted. Scenarios of the shutdown Second Act Cruz, elected in 2012 with tea party support, has angered Republican veterans since joining the Senate by promoting political crusades for extreme conservative causes that ignore traditions of the chamber and, in some cases, political reality. Last week, he called on the Senate to follow the House GOP lead in voting to defund Obamacare, even though prominent Republicans criticized him, with Sen. John McCain of Arizona labeling the plan impossible to achieve and therefore irrational. Even one of Cruz\u2019s libertarian allies, Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, concedes that the health care reforms are probably here to stay, though he backs a Senate filibuster to try to delay or undermine them as much as possible. Meanwhile, other tea party favorites including Sarah Palin support the effort by Cruz to upend Senate normalcy by forcing Democrats and fellow Republicans to repeatedly make highly publicized votes for or against Obamacare. In an op-ed published Monday on the website RealClearPolitics.com, Cruz called for GOP unity against Obamacare through a successful filibuster of any spending plan that includes funding for the health care reforms. He laid out a procedural strategy in which Senate Republicans refuse to allow Reid to take up the House measure \u2013 a step known as cloture that requires 60 votes \u2013 unless the Democratic leader also permits a 60-vote threshold to pass any subsequent amendments such as the certain removal of the provision defunding Obamacare. Otherwise, amendments pass by a simple 51-vote majority that the Democrats possess. \u201cUntil Reid guarantees a 60-vote threshold on all amendments, a vote for cloture is a vote for Obamacare,\u201d Cruz wrote, calling for a public groundswell to motivate legislators from both parties to back his approach. He showed the raw politics of his strategy by targeting Democratic senators who face re-election next year in conservative-leaning states. \u201cIf you\u2019re a Mark Pryor, if you\u2019re a Mary Landrieu, running for re-election in Arkansas and Louisiana, and you start to get 5,000, 10,000, 20,000, 50,000 calls from your constituents, suddenly, it changes the calculus entirely,\u201d Cruz told \u201cFox News Sunday.\u201d However, opposition to Cruz\u2019s approach by senior Senate Republicans including McConnell, McCain, Tom Coburn of Oklahoma, Bob Corker of Tennessee and others show it lacks the votes for a successful filibuster. Critics warn that bombastic political rhetoric and promises that can\u2019t be fulfilled can undermine serious efforts to move forward. \u201cI think one of the things we are struggling with is establishing what\u2019s a realistic expectation for what we can accomplish when we control one out of three parts of the elected government,\u201d GOP Sen. Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania told MSNBC on Monday. \u201cWhen you control only one out of the three, you don\u2019t get to dictate all the terms. But you can have some wins if you\u2019re smart and if you focus on where that opportunity lies.\u201d Democratic Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York said the end result would be worked out amid all the political maneuvering. \u201cThere are obviously going to be negotiations going on while this is happening,\u201d Schumer told MSNBC on Monday. \u201cSo everyone\u2019s going to know what\u2019s happening.  Everyone\u2019s going to know the inevitable outcome.\u201d Third Act Despite all the procedural hoopla, Reid and Democrats intend to cut out the provision that defunds Obamacare and return the spending plan to the House. That would put the pressure on Boehner. He could decide to set aside the measure, essentially declaring a stalemate between the House and Senate that would bring a government shutdown, which he has said he opposes. Boehner also could bring the revised spending plan up for a vote and possibly allow for new amendments. This is where things get tricky. Because the Senate procedural battles are expected to last all week, the House will be under pressure to act quickly to avoid a government shutdown beginning October 1. Boehner could allow a vote on the \u201cclean\u201d resolution sent back by the Senate, which would likely pass with support from all the House Democrats and a few dozen Republicans to reach the 218 majority threshold. However, most House Republicans would vote \u201cno\u201d in that scenario, further weakening Boehner\u2019s already shaky leadership of his party\u2019s caucus after a similar result in a past budget battle. Boehner also could allow GOP amendments to be added, such as a proposal to delay implementation of Obamacare for a year. The intent would be put the pressure back on the Senate, and particularly Senate Democrats, to reject the revised House proposal and therefore risk getting blamed for a government shutdown. That might not happen until after October 1 with a shutdown already begun, leaving Republicans vulnerable to the public perception they were responsible. Recent polling shows growing public opposition to Obamacare, but much greater dislike for a government shutdown, particularly among independent voters considered crucial to presidential hopefuls. In addition, more respondents indicated they would blame Republicans for a shutdown. Epilogue The deadline to increase the federal debt ceiling \u2013 how much money the government can borrow to pay its bills \u2013 is coming up in mid-October, presenting another opportunity for Cruz and other Republicans to go after Obamacare. House Republican leader Eric Cantor of Virginia already has said the House will consider a debt ceiling measure this week with a wish list of GOP priorities attached, including delaying Obamacare for a year and launching construction of the Keystone oil pipeline from Canada.

            "article_content": "Momentum for immigration reform hit wall in Washington after Senate passage Local and national politics may call for different things for Republicans in immigration debate Obama signaled potential opening to get something through as window for action gets smaller Some Republicans less optimistic even though many believe reform needed to boost their prospects Brad Bailey, a Texas restaurateur and city councilman in the Houston suburb of Nassau Bay, is a Republican. But in the early stages of the 2012 presidential campaign, when Mitt Romney was telling the country that \u201cself-deportation\u201d was a reasonable solution to the problem of 11 million illegal immigrants living the United States, it became difficult for Bailey not to view politics through the eyes of his Hispanic employees, who were mortified at the Republican Party\u2019s tone-deaf language on immigration policy. \u201cOur party had been hijacked by a vocal minority,\u201d he began telling people at the time. Before the campaign was even over, Bailey launched something called \u201cThe Texas Immigration Solution\u201d to lobby Republicans on the need for reform and to \u201csensitize conservatives about the rhetoric on immigration.\u201d Government shutdown: d\u00e9j\u00e0 vu or D-Day Government shutdown? Here's the lowdown With financial backing from his neighbor, the Republican mega-donor Bob Perry, a fervent supporter of immigration reform, the group got off to an auspicious start. In 2012, Bailey helped push activists in the Texas Republican Party to soften the immigration language in its official platform, adding a plank calling for a temporary guest worker program. And after President Barack Obama won Hispanic voters by a nearly 3-1 margin, a demographic drubbing that startled GOP tacticians everywhere, Bailey embarked on a public relations blitz that landed his message in national outlets like NPR, The Huffington Post, Politico and RedState.com. By the time the Senate took up the issue in the spring, comprehensive immigration reform finally seemed to have momentum. A brick wall With an assist from Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, a tea party aligned Cuban-American, the Senate passed a sweeping bill that would create a path to citizenship for millions of undocumented immigrants, raise the cap on visas for high-skilled workers, and boost security along the U.S.-Mexico border. But the legislation hit a brick wall in the Republican-controlled House, where Speaker John Boehner, hamstrung by a bloc of unruly conservatives in his caucus, has refused to bring the comprehensive bill up for a vote, instead urging Congress to pass a series of smaller fixes. An immigration stalemate in the House, a graveyard for Obama\u2019s legislative agenda since Republicans re-captured the chamber in 2010, was predictable. But here\u2019s what almost no one saw coming: a late-summer diplomatic chess match over whether to launch missile strikes against Syria that chewed up valuable calendar time, and now, the looming threat of a government shutdown over a budget gambit \u2013 surprisingly endorsed this week by House GOP leadership \u2013 that would defund the president\u2019s health care reform law. After that, another high-stakes showdown over raising the country\u2019s debt ceiling is on the docket. Today, time is running out to pass immigration reform. Republicans like Bailey who lie awake at night fretting about their party\u2019s weak standing among Hispanic voters are worried that nothing will happen before the 2014 elections suck up the nation\u2019s political oxygen. \u201cThe calendar just keeps getting more stuff put on it,\u201d said Bailey, who saw his group\u2019s funding dry up after Perry, his top financial backer, died in April. \u201cKicking the can down the road does no good. One day I might be optimistic, but the next I\u2019m kind of pessimistic.\u201d A dilemma Going back to the failed 2005 and 2007 overhaul efforts by then-President George W. Bush, the GOP\u2019s stasis on immigration reform has crystallized the party\u2019s existential dilemma. Torn between its hard-line right flank and the urgent need to boost its standing among general election voters and one of the country\u2019s fastest-growing voting blocs, Republicans have been caught in what Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina calls \u201ca demographic death spiral\u201d as Democrats continue to rack up huge margins among Hispanic voters at the polls. Among the GOP\u2019s pragmatic set, there are mounting fears that Republicans, consumed with budget battles and procedural wars in do-nothing Washington, will have little to say to Hispanic voters by the time the 2016 presidential race arrives. \u201cWe need to find solutions to these problems, not just continue to find the problems in every possible solution, thereby supporting nothing and ensuring the status quo remains the same,\u201d said Rich Beeson, the political director for Romney\u2019s presidential campaign. Beeson lives in Colorado, a state where Obama won a stunning 75% of Hispanic voters. \u201cThis is one area where most people expect both parties to come together and find a solution, not stand in the corner and shout at each other,\u201d Beeson said. Matt David, a Republican operative who managed former Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman\u2019s unsuccessful Republican presidential bid, said \u201cwe can\u2019t make gains with Hispanics subliminally; we have to demonstrate publicly that we will fight for them.\u201d \u201cDemocrats will make immigration an issue, and we should welcome it, fight for it, and denounce anyone in our party who doesn\u2019t support it,\u201d David said. After Romney\u2019s loss, Republican leaders were eager to recover precious ground lost among Hispanic voters in the last two presidential elections, which saw Republican candidates staking out hard line stands on border security and deportation during the primaries in an appeal to the party\u2019s activist base. A post-election autopsy report written by a Republican National Committee task force called on GOP leaders to \u201cembrace and champion comprehensive immigration reform\u201d or risk becoming a permanently-hobbled party ruled by an aging, white constituency. Following last November\u2019s election, fielding phone calls in his Richmond-area district, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor of Virginia listened to countless members of his caucus vent about the need to fix the immigration system in a bid to save the party. \u201cVery quickly we learned that for a lot of our members, we have to do something about immigration,\u201d said a House Republican aide, granted anonymity to speak candidly about the state of immigration reform in the GOP caucus. \u201cNine months later, and we haven\u2019t yet. I think while we still want to do something, that sense of urgency is gone.\u201d Parochial concerns Complicating matters, this aide said, are competing imperatives of congressional elections and national ones. In both Democratic and Republican-leaning House districts, the hot political battles are most often waged in primaries rather than general elections. With gerrymandered districts drawn to favor one party or another, self-preservation in Congress increasingly hinges on appealing to the base, general election voters be damned. \u201cSome of our members are saying, \u2018I realize it\u2019s a national problem, but it\u2019s not my problem because my district\u2019s not Hispanic,\u2019\u201d the House aide said. Though the window to pass reform is shrinking by the day, some GOP congressional aides are quietly working with the House Judiciary Committee to draft several smaller pieces of legislation that could \u201chave an opportunity or a chance\u201d to see a vote by late October, said another Republican aide involved in the process. Pieces of legislation addressing border security, agricultural workers, employment verification, visas for high and low-skilled workers, and a path to citizenship for the children of illegal immigrants could all emerge from the Judiciary Committee and be brought to a full vote in the House, according to the aide said. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot going on that people don\u2019t see,\u201d the aide said. House negotiations were dealt a blow on Friday, however, when two Texas Republicans, Reps. John Carter and Sam Johnson, dropped out of a bipartisan working group on immigration, citing doubts about Obama\u2019s willingness to enforce any new laws. A possible opening Obama signaled this week that he would be open to what Washington is calling \u201ca piecemeal approach\u201d to immigration reform rather than the comprehensive bill that emerged from the Senate, as long as the proposals are in line with the spirit of what the White House hopes to achieve. New York Sen. Charles Schumer, one of Democrats who drafted the Senate bill, also said in August he would be open to the House passing a series of smaller bills and then potentially bundling them together in conference, if both parties agree to. The biggest point of contention between Republicans and Democrats remains a pathway to citizenship for illegal immigrants, a move favored by Democrats but long derided as \u201camnesty\u201d by many conservative Republicans. Other supporters of a comprehensive immigration overhaul are now open to a smaller approach that at least brings the House and Senate together in conference to hash out their differences before time runs out on the legislative calendar. \u201cThe House doesn\u2019t have to pass everything to get it into conference. The end goal is to get something out of the House that pushes this into conference,\u201d said John Feinblatt, a policy adviser to New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg. Bloomberg is co-chair of the Partnership for a New American Economy, a coalition of business and political leaders pressing for immigration changes this year. \u201cThere is a window to do it,\u201d Feinblatt said. \u201cYou could do it after the debt ceiling. You could have a path to do it between then and Thanksgiving.\u201d Less optimism Publicly at least, Republican legislators in Washington are not projecting the same air of optimism. Rubio, a likely candidate for his party\u2019s presidential nomination in 2016, told the conservative website Newsmax this week that the immigration issue is on the backburner. \u201cThe budget fights are important and Obamacare is incredibly important,\u201d he said. \u201cThe national debt and the debt limit is going to be incredibly important. Those issues are time sensitive. Immigration\u2019s a big issue but these issues are bigger and that\u2019s why the focus is on those issues right now.\u201d Idaho Rep. Raul Labrador, a native of Puerto Rico and an Republican opponent of the comprehensive Senate bill, made a blunter admission to Univision earlier this month when he said immigration reform might not even be on the table until 2015 \u2013 after next year\u2019s midterm elections and in the heat of Republican presidential primary season. \u201cA lot of us thought that the debate was going to be in October, but now, with the problems that we\u2019re having internationally and also here in this country, I don\u2019t see how we\u2019re going to be able to have this debate until November,\u201d Labrador said. \u201cAnd I really don\u2019t know if it will be possible to do it in November.\u201d If Republicans fail to clean up their reputation with Hispanics through policy fixes, the party will be left to make adjustments in their tone and rhetoric \u2013 a project complicated by conservatives like Iowa Rep. Steve King who have a knack for making inflammatory statements that quickly go viral on cable and the Internet. In July, King said that for every child of an illegal immigrant who is a valedictorian, \u201cthere\u2019s another 100 out there who weigh 130 pounds and they\u2019ve got calves the size of cantaloupes because they\u2019re hauling 75 pounds of marijuana across the desert.\u201d Party leaders were not amused. \u201cIt\u2019s not just policy or whether there\u2019s action or inaction, it\u2019s also whether the Republican Party is viewed as welcoming to Hispanic citizens or hostile to Hispanic citizens,\u201d said Steve Munisteri, the chairman of the Texas Republican Party who has five full-time Hispanic outreach directors working on staff. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to fake people out on sincerity. If the national party doesn\u2019t roll out the welcome mat, were going to have the door slammed in our face.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Biden distant second to Hillary Clinton in a new poll on 2016 presidential nod The poll also indicates no frontrunner for the 2016 GOP nomination at this point Seventeen percent of Republicans and GOP-leaning independents likely to support Chris Christie But the poll also indicates problems for Christie with conservative Republicans; Rubio number drops A new national poll in the battle for the 2016 Democratic and Republican presidential nominations indicates what you would expect: Hillary Clinton is the overwhelming Democratic frontrunner, and there\u2019s no real leader among the possible GOP White House hopefuls. But if you get beyond the obvious, the CNN/ORC International survey released Monday becomes more revealing. It showed 65% of Democrats and independents who lean toward that party say they would likely back Clinton as their presidential nominee. Vice President Joe Biden comes in a distant second, at 10%, with freshman Sen. Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts at 7%, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo at 6%, and Maryland Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley at 2%. Hillary Clinton speaks up on Syria Biden: House GOP  'Neanderthals' Christie: Boardwalk fire 'unthinkable' Paul: Moral message leaves Assad in place The CNN survey is in line with previous polls from other organizations conducted earlier this year that indicated Clinton, who has not said whether she\u2019ll run, is far ahead of all the other possible Democratic candidates. Hillary Clinton: Syria weapons handover would be \u2018important step\u2019 Even though the next race for the White House is a long way away, there\u2019s already intense speculation over whether the former secretary of state will make a second bid for president. As with previous surveys this year, the new CNN poll also indicates no GOP frontrunner. Seventeen percent of Republicans and Independents who lean toward the GOP say they are likely to support New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, with 16% backing Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, the House Budget Committee chairman and 2012 Republican vice presidential nominee. Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky is at 13%; former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush at 10%; Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida at 9%; Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas at 7%, and former Sen. Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania, a 2012 Republican presidential candidate who battled eventual nominee Mitt Romney deep into the primary season, at 5%. Opinion: A reversal for GOP and Democrats Rubio\u2019s number stands out. The first-term senator, considered a rock star among many Republicans, registered in the upper teens in polls of the possible GOP 2016 horserace conducted by other organizations earlier this year. But Rubio\u2019s support of immigration reform \u2013 he was a high profile member of a bipartisan group of senators who pushed immigration reform passage through the Senate this spring \u2013 may have hurt his standing with many conservative voters opposed to such efforts. Santorum\u2019s 5% is also interesting. \u201cIt\u2019s often said \u2013 and it\u2019s usually true \u2013 that polls taken years before the first presidential primaries are mostly tests of name recognition. But clearly (it\u2019s) something more than name recognition when it comes to Santorum,\u201d says CNN Polling Director Keating Holland. Rubio: Syria shouldn't have WMDs Sen. Cruz: 'Grassroots tsunami' Santorum: Obama's leadership failed \u201cSantorum is well-known to GOP voters \u2013 he had months of national exposure in the 2012 primaries, and since the start of the modern primary system in the 1970s, the GOP has tended to nominate the candidate who was the runner-up the last time the party had an open race for the nomination.  But Santorum is not just in the middle of the pack \u2013 he is currently running dead last out of the eight candidates tested,\u201d adds Holland. Santorum: The U.S. has no national security interest in Syria Christie may be on top of the list, but he\u2019s not first in the minds of conservatives, who dominate more moderate Republicans in the GOP primaries and caucuses. According to the poll, only 8% of Republicans who consider themselves conservatives say they would be likely to back Christie, compared to 28% of self-described moderate Republicans. In the potential Democratic battle, the survey indicates Clinton performing better with women (76%) than men (52%). And Biden scores higher with voters age 50 and older (18%) than those younger than 50 (5%). Biden: House Republicans \u2018Neanderthals\u2019 With the start of the primary and caucus calendar more than two years off, take this survey and others with a grain of salt. \u201cPolls taken two to three years before an election have absolutely no predictive value,\u201d adds Holland. \u201cDo not treat this as a prediction of what will happen in 2016.\u201d Biden courts presidential speculation with Iowa trip The CNN poll was conducted by ORC International September 6-8, with 1,022 adult Americans questioned by telephone. The survey\u2019s overall sampling error for Democratic and GOP primary questions is plus or minus 4.5 percentage points. The sample included 218 respondents who describe themselves as Republicans and 234 who describe themselves as independents who lean towards GOP, for a total of 452 Republicans, and 311 respondents who describe themselves as Democrats and 137 who describe themselves as independents who lean Democratic, for a total of 448 Democrats.",

            "article_content": "Other issues take attention away from economic struggle Obstinate House, threats of shutdowns, fears of starting war have been obstacles Still, the deficit has been reduced, and the economy is improving White House report: \"We've cleared away the rubble from the financial crisis\" It\u2019s been five years since the banking and credit crisis rocked the U.S. economy, causing markets to plunge, unemployment to spike, housing values to crumble and placing more Americans in financial peril than at any time since the Great Depression. On Monday, President Barack Obama touted his administration\u2019s successes in helping to turn things around even though national economic growth remains sluggish and millions of people have given up looking for work. Obama said government\u2019s response \u201cput a floor under the fall\u201d and his policies set the stage for an end to economic contraction and created an environment for the economy to grow again. The president specifically pointed to the impact of the economic stimulus, creation of seven million jobs, the resurgence of the bailed out Detroit automakers, higher taxes on the wealthiest earners and an increase in exports. \u201cWe\u2019ve cleared away the rubble from the financial crisis and we\u2019ve begun to lay a new foundation for economic growth and prosperity,\u201d Obama said. Although Obama paints a rosy scenario, there are still key questions on the economy. Larry Summers, a leading name to become the next chairman of the Federal Reserve, withdrew his name from consideration on Sunday, clearing the way for Janet Yellen, who serves as vice chairwoman at the Fed, to become the leading candidate. Also, the White House announced last week that top economic adviser, Gene Sperling, will step down as head of the National Economic Council and be replaced by Jeffrey Zients, the acting director of the Office of Management and Budget. There is also the looming showdown with Congress on funding the government, raising the ability of the nation to borrow money to pay its bills, and continuation of the drastic budget cuts that took effect earlier this year absent a deal in Washington to reduce the deficit. There is also the potential impact of the Affordable Care Act, the sweeping health care law backed by Obama that is taking effect this year and remains a political flashpoint with Republicans. It\u2019s the economy, stupid That motto was made famous by political strategist James Carville during Bill Clinton\u2019s 1992 presidential campaign, and rang true for Obama\u2019s first presidential campaign as well. And the American public agrees. In poll after poll, fixing the economy is a stubborn No. 1 when it comes to the issues the voters most care about. A CNN/ORC International poll conducted this month indicates that 41% of the public says the economy is the most important issue facing the country right now, with health care at 16% and the crisis in Syria at 15%. Soon after taking office, Obama signed a massive economic stimulus bill, led the charge for Wall Street reform and accelerated the bailout of the U.S. auto industry, which threatened to collapse and take more than 1 million jobs with it. Some began to compare Obama to President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who transformed the fabric of American society in the face of the Depression with aggressive government intervention. \u2018Poor marks\u2019 But since his first two years in office, some experts say, the president has struggled to keep focused on the economy. Liberal economist Dean Baker has been highly critical of his record. \u201cI give him very poor marks. Five years later, the economy is still very far from recovering,\u201d said Baker, co-founder of the Center for Economic and Policy Research, pointing to an unemployment rate that he says would hover around 9% instead of 7.3% if so many people hadn\u2019t given up and dropped out of the work force. And it shows in Obama\u2019s approval ratings. Through much of last year, he had a 30% approval rating on the economy. That number is up this year \u2013 to 43% \u2013 but most still disapprove of his handling of the issue. A screeching halt In 2010, many conservatives, led by the tea party movement, sought to stop the president\u2019s agenda. They voted out the Democratic majority in the House of Representatives and replaced them with conservative Republicans. Then, those Republicans did what they were sent to Washington to do. The president has struggled to pass any major economic legislation since 2010. Instead, he\u2019s been jumping from one political crisis to the next. Fights over federal budget and spending levels locked Congress in multiple battles in 2011 and 2012 that nearly led to the shutdown of the government. The narrative didn\u2019t always fall in Obama\u2019s favor; nor did the policies that ensued. Republicans shifted the conversation from economic stimulus to deficit reduction. The president jumped on the deficit-reduction bandwagon and made that a priority. Through protracted political battles over the size of the government, forced spending cuts, which sliced up to 10% of most of the federal budget, went into effect. It wasn\u2019t the president\u2019s favorite idea, however, for how to revive the economy. He still had hopes of repairing old bridges and building new windmills. So did his supporters, who grew frustrated with the president. \u201cWe\u2019re getting tired. \u2026 The unemployment is unconscionable. We don\u2019t know what the (president\u2019s) strategy is,\u201d Rep. Maxine Waters, D-California, said in 2012. But in the frame of deficit reduction, Obama was able to obtain a few concessions. He won a series of tax increases, including an increase on the top tax earners: those making more than $400,000 per year. And the needle moved. The budget cuts, tax increases and a recovering economy will reduce the deficit by about $4 trillion over 10 years, according to the White House. The nation\u2019s debt ratio to size of the gross domestic product is expected to stabilize in the next decade, which economists hail as good for the economy. The foreign affairs president While the president came into office with little experience in foreign affairs and hopes to implement an expansive domestic agenda, overseas conflict has kept his plate full. He expanded the war in Afghanistan and ended the war in Iraq. He kept his attention on the citizen-led revolts that swept the Arab world and expanded the use of drones. Under his administration, al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden was killed and the U.S. joined a NATO campaign to overthrow Libyan dictator Moammar Gadhafi, and Obama is now working on an intense campaign to respond to the use of chemical weapons in Syria\u2019s civil war. Although presidents are forced to walk and chew gum at the same time, world events have created challenges for Obama\u2019s ability to implement his domestic agenda. \u201cWhen you look at issues like military strikes in Syria \u2026 it takes the full time and attention of the leaders,\u201d Norman Ornstein of the American Enterprise Institute said recently. As the president decided to hold off on a military strike in Syria while Secretary of State John Kerry works with his counterpart in Russia to devise a plan to rid the regime of its chemical weapons, the president attempted to revitalize discussion of his domestic agenda. \u201cEven as we have been spending a lot of time on the Syria issue \u2026 it is still important to recognize that we\u2019ve got a lot more stuff to do here in this government,\u201d Obama said during a meeting with his Cabinet on Thursday. Economist Mark Zandi said that, all things considered, the president has been fairly successful on the domestic front. \u201cIt has been a tough road, but I think he did a pretty good job,\u201d said Zandi, chief economist at Moody\u2019s Analytics. But economist Baker offered a more critical perspective, saying the president hasn\u2019t shown a willingness to push an economic agenda. \u201cLet\u2019s say Syria didn\u2019t happen. What would he be doing right now? I am not sure he has some agenda that is being obstructed by events in the world,\u201d he said. Syria aside, much of the White House\u2019s attention this fall will be spent on getting Americans to sign up for the health insurance exchanges, the heart of the Affordable Care Act. Open enrollment begins October 1, and the administration is expected to spend $8.7 million on a media blitz to promote the exchanges. Super Bowl champs to promote Obamacare Second term, second chance After his re-election, the president hoped to reset his economic agenda. In his 2013 State of the Union address, Obama said he will work to \u201creignite the true engine of America\u2019s economic growth: a rising, thriving middle class.\u201d This summer, he launched a campaign to revive his focus on the economy. In a series of speeches this year, he acknowledged the troubling economic indicators that are keeping the economy from a full recovery, including income inequality and employment disparities. Americans\u2019 real median household income fell from $63,000 to $55,600 between 2000 and 2011, and as of December, 9.1 million jobs were necessary to restore the job market to pre-recession levels, according to the Economic Policy Institute. \u201cReversing these trends has to be Washington\u2019s highest priority. It has to be Washington\u2019s highest priority. It\u2019s certainly my highest priority,\u201d Obama said in Galesburg, Illinois, in July. Job creation, affordable education and home ownership were central to his proposals. Those initiatives included expanding development of renewable energy, creating new power grids and expanding access to early childhood education. But what has the president done since that July speech? Some say, not much. \u201cNothing has happened on any front,\u201d economist Zandi said. White House press secretary Jay Carney pushed back, arguing that the president is still focused on those economic priorities. \u201cThe president remains committed to pushing forward on an economic agenda that creates a better bargain for the middle class,\u201d Carney said Wednesday. As new threats of a government shutdown over government funding and the debt ceiling loom, the president confronted the issue Monday. \u201cI can\u201dt remember a time when one faction of one party promises economic chaos if it doesn\u2019t get 100% of what it wants,\u201d the president said, blaming the Republicans for potential \u201cmassive economic turmoil.\u201d With ongoing political stalemates and a protracted fight over the budget and debt ceiling, Zandi said immigration reform, which would be a major catalyst for economic growth, appears to be heading nowhere in the House. And tax and entitlement reform, which would also help to stimulate the economy, have no chance of happening this year. There\u2019s always next year. But 2014 is an election year, which creates an even more difficult environment for passing legislation. After that, the president is in his final two years of office, and the political machine begins shaping the next occupant of the Oval Office. Then, by definition, it can be hard for a lame duck president to get much done. CNN\u2019s Dan Merica, Paul Steinhauser and Kevin Liptak contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Five of six candidates competing in Democratic primary for New York City mayor debated Progressive candidate Bill de Blasio is the presumed front-runner, with 43% in latest poll Republicans will also hold their mayoral primary on same day, September 10 Five of six Democratic candidates vying to become the next mayor of New York City took to the airwaves Tuesday night in the last of three debates. The hourlong televised debate continued for another half hour online, one week before the primary. Unlike the last debate, during which the city\u2019s stop-and-frisk law enforcement policies dominated the discussion, the Democratic candidates answered questions on everything from immigration and labor contracts to education. Hours before the debate, a new Quinnipiac University poll showed Progressive candidate Bill de Blasio grabbing the support of 43% of likely Democratic primary voters, with Bill Thompson at 20%, Christine Quinn at 18%, Anthony Weiner 7% and John Liu at 4%. A sixth candidate, Sal Albanese, is polling at 1%. The rest of the respondents were undecided. During the debate, de Blasio came back numerous times to his proposal to tax anyone making more than $500,000 and put the money toward education. \u201cThis is a city which has always believed in big, bold ideas,\u201d de Blasio said in response to a question from Thompson. Other candidates stressed the importance of early education, with Thompson noting the importance of an \u201cintensive curriculum\u201d and help with \u201cprofessional development.\u201d The front-runner also fended off attacks from other candidates on his changing position on term limits and accusations regarding his record with a worst landlords list. According to a New York Daily News article on Sunday, de Blasio, who created the list in 2010 in his role as public advocate, \u201cwent to bat\u201d for one landlord with a \u201crash of violations\u201d when the landlord steered donations his way. Quinn cited the \u201chorrible conditions\u201d of some of the buildings on de Blasio\u2019s list, claiming some people in the buildings complained of still living in \u201csqualor.\u201d De Blasio cited the \u201c300 buildings\u201d that were fixed, saying, \u201cI\u2019m proud of what we did.\u201d Moderators from WNBC News, which broadcast the debate, Telemundo and The Wall Street Journal  asked each candidate a specific question, including how much each candidate earned per year. When asked about using a slush fund, Quinn said it was a practice that has been dropped. Thompson was asked why he has not taken a stronger stance on stop and frisk, to which he forcefully replied he believed the policy had been misused and abused and people were targeted for \u201cwho they are and what they looked like.\u201d Weiner was asked about his credibility as a candidate. Calling himself \u201can imperfect messenger,\u201d Weiner indicated he would still be effective if elected mayor. Liu, who spoke over the allotted time limit more than once during the debate,  called for a comprehensive plan from childhood to high school and \u201crestoring a learning environment\u201d when answering on education. The New York Democratic mayoral primary will be held on Tuesday, September 10.  If a candidate does not cross the 40% threshold, there will be a runoff between the two top contenders on October 1. On the Republican side, candidates Joe Lhota, John Catsimatidis and George McDonald faced off August 28 in a debate. The GOP primary also will be held on September 10. The general election is scheduled for November 5.",

            "article_content": "Incumbent Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham is targeted by conservative activists Tea party activist: 'We don't like Lindsey Graham' Despite his vulnerability, a strong primary challenge to Graham hasn't emerged Expanding the runoff process from two weeks to 35 days could be game-changer Since the elections of 2010, when a tide of grassroots fervor swept through the state and vaulted a bumper crop of fresh-faced conservative leaders into office, South Carolina\u2019s Republican political establishment has been drastically reshaped. The state\u2019s governor, Nikki Haley, is a 41-year -old Indian-American. Tim Scott is the first African-American to represent the state in the United States Senate. In the U.S. House, a band of ambitious South Carolina congressmen make up the backbone of GOP opposition to President Barack Obama. Inside the copper-domed statehouse in Columbia, libertarian-leaning Republicans have expanded their influence. There is chatter here that the state\u2019s lieutenant governor, an avatar of good ol\u2019 boy Republicanism who has held elected office since 1980, might finally step down after next year. But there is one major scalp that conservative activists have yet to claim: That of Sen. Lindsey Graham, the blunt foreign policy hawk and immigration reform advocate who has needled his party\u2019s activist base for years, on issues ranging from civil liberties to tort reform to his support for Obama\u2019s appointments to the Supreme Court. \u201cI think I can safely speak for just about everyone in the tea party that we don\u2019t like Lindsey Graham,\u201d said Keith Tripp, a member of the Laurens County Tea Party. But before the anti-Graham set can remove him from office, they have a more basic, pressing question to answer: Just who can beat him? Graham ready for GOP primary challenge Graham: al Qaeda is on the rise Senators McCain and Graham visit Egypt U.S. senators urge release of prisoners The absence of a serious primary challenger is an enormous stroke of good luck that has Graham loyalists breathing comfortably \u2013 for now. Rep. Mick Mulvaney, a darling of the South Carolina right who could have instantly commanded national attention and money if he ran for the seat, passed on challenging Graham earlier this year, leaving conservatives with a trio of unpolished, lower-tier candidates who are adept at grabbing headlines but untested when it comes to mounting the kind of statewide campaign needed to topple an incumbent senator with decades of political chits in his back pocket. \u201cThis idea that Lindsey Graham is in trouble is one of the biggest myths out there,\u201d said Richard Quinn, Graham\u2019s consultant and pollster. A \u2018small but noisy\u2019 faction Even at this early stage of the campaign, there is a sense within the state\u2019s political class that Graham, who was first elected to Congress in 1994 as part of the Republican Revolution and moved up to the Senate in 2002, will survive a threat from what many here term a \u201csmall but noisy\u201d faction of the GOP. Chip Felkel, a longtime GOP operative who learned the trade at the feet of Warren Abernathy, Strom Thurmond\u2019s political wrangler, has started referring to the tea party activists who have taken control of several county party organizations here as \u201crascals\u201d \u2013 \u201cRepublicans against solutions, communication and logic/leadership,\u201d he said. \u201cAnyone looking at this from outside the state needs to understand that while the rascals are upset with Graham, the average GOP primary voter will not see these folks as legit contenders, for a number of reasons,\u201d he said. \u201cA race, sure; a very serious challenge, not so much.\u201d Graham\u2019s vulnerability on the right is real, and hardly a new phenomenon: Even as he won re-election in 2008, he still managed to lose Greenville County, the state\u2019s largest Republican county, to his ineffectual primary challenger, a balding gadfly named Buddy Witherspoon who centered his entire campaign on Graham\u2019s support for immigration reform. But Graham\u2019s advantages are many. The senator has at least $6.25 million in his campaign war chest. That sum is growing and is expected to dwarf the cash-on-hand totals of his Republican challengers by the time the next campaign filings are due. His supporters have also formed a super PAC, the West Main Street Values PAC, with the unstated but clear purpose of attacking whichever of his opponents, if any, emerge as a serious threat before next June\u2019s primary. With no serious Democratic candidate in a GOP-leaning state, Graham\u2019s seat is all but certain to remain in Republican hands. \u201cLindsey should win and is going to win, but nothing is going to be easy this cycle,\u201d said Katon Dawson, a former state GOP chairman who created the super PAC. \u201cRepublicans are going to circle the wagons and shoot each other for a while, and then the Republican Party is going to have to decide who we are and what we represent. And Lindsey Graham is fine with me.\u201d Also helping from the sidelines is the South Carolina Conservative Action Alliance, an independent group run by a group of Graham allies that recently enlisted former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee for a statewide radio ad calling Graham \u201ca conservative champion.\u201d Few here doubt that Graham will win the Republican primary, which is open to Democrats and independents. U.S. lawmakers enter Egypt quagmire Boycott Olympics for Putin's attention? Sen. Graham: Clearly the system failed What makes his team anxious, though, is the prospect of Graham failing to win more than 50% of the primary vote, which would trigger a runoff election between the top two finishers. Graham faces crowded field in primary South Carolina runoffs are short, two-week sprints that often favor the primary winner. A more worrisome scenario for Graham backers \u2013 currently little more than a buzzy rumor flying around Columbia \u2013 would be a lawsuit to extend the length of the runoff and turn the Senate race into a monthlong, one-on-one clash between Graham and a single conservative opponent. \u201cIf we catch a 35-day runoff, Lindsey is screwed,\u201d murmured one Graham supporter. That depends on which opponent Graham draws. Three Republicans have announced bids to unseat Graham: Nancy Mace, a marketing and public relations consultant who was the first female graduate of The Citadel, the Charleston military college; Richard Cash, a onetime anti-abortion activist and former congressional candidate who owns a fleet of ice cream trucks; and state Sen. Lee Bright, a brash conservative who backed libertarian-leaning presidential candidate Ron Paul in his race for the White House. A fourth candidate, attorney and Army veteran Bill Connor, may join the fray in the coming weeks. What they have in common is a belief that Graham, who made term limits a centerpiece of his first campaign for Congress in 1994, has been in Washington too long and is too willing to compromise with Democrats on banner issues. His steadfast support for the National Security Agency\u2019s surveillance program is particularly upsetting to the state\u2019s emboldened libertarian movement, which all of Graham\u2019s foes are courting. \u201cI don\u2019t think he is focused on our liberties as much as he is Obama\u2019s agenda,\u201d Bright said. \u201cYou would think as a conservative he would be fighting for the Bill of Rights, trying to protect our way of life. And he is not doing that. He is trying to be the chief negotiator on whatever the deal is.\u201d Bright\u2019s small-government disposition and his ties to the Ron Paul wing of the GOP have made him a grassroots favorite in his Greenville-area senate district. But Graham allies have been calling attention to his habit of making over-the-top statements. On the day he joined the race, Bright labeled Graham, who had traveled on a diplomatic mission this summer to Egypt, \u201can organizer for the Muslim Brotherhood\u201d \u2013 a criticism he applied to Obama this week. \u201cI think that Obama is very sympathetic to the Muslim Brotherhood,\u201d Bright told CNN. \u201cI think he has got certain embedded hostilities to the American way of life, and he sees them as a group that has been disenfranchised by the leadership of those countries. He is more in line with Muslim extremists than he is with Muslims. He seems to identify with their cause. I don\u2019t know if he is a Muslim extremist. But I don\u2019t know what his faith is. He professes to be a Christian, so I take him at his word.\u201d The mild-mannered Cash, who came out of nowhere in 2010 to win a Republican primary in the state\u2019s 3rd Congressional District before losing a runoff to Rep. Jeff Duncan, is thought to be a sleeper in the race because of his roots in the anti-abortion movement and his quiet relationship with a network of home-school parents in the conservative Upstate. An early supporter of Rick Santorum during the 2012 presidential race, Cash, who has the kindly look of a pediatric dentist, frames himself as a defender of \u201cChristianity, capitalism, and the Constitution.\u201d Graham backers seem comfortable with the idea of a runoff against Cash or Bright, neither of whom has demonstrated great fundraising prowess or an ability to appeal to Republicans outside the hard-line conservative base. Woman opponent could complicate things for Graham The candidate being watched with most interest by Graham-world is Mace. Despite being just 35 years old and having few detailed policy positions other than a list of conservative platitudes on her website, Mace, a mother hailing from a decorated military family in Charleston, has the most intriguing profile of the bunch. A serious challenge from a female opponent could complicate matters for Graham if he is forced to go negative in the campaign, said Barry Wynn, a leading Republican fundraiser in Greenville. \u201cSouth Carolina voters have historically liked incumbents but will not tolerate attacks on women candidates,\u201d Wynn said, pointing to Gov. Haley\u2019s GOP primary battle in 2010, when a volley of attacks from her male opponents only drove her poll numbers higher. It\u2019s not hard to imagine the fraught nature of running against a woman in South Carolina. In one conversation this week, a senior Republican in the state, a man, recalled an appearance by Mace at a recent GOP event and described her outfit as \u201cnot very becoming.\u201d Looming over the race, albeit from his highly paid perch at the Heritage Foundation in Washington, is former Sen. Jim DeMint, the guiding light of limited-government conservatism for many Republicans here. DeMint and Graham often differed wildly on a number of national issues and they are not close friends, but the two have mostly enjoyed a political truce back home for almost a decade. DeMint has given no indication that he intends to involve himself in the primary, nor do his prot\u00e9g\u00e9s seem willing to join the fight to unseat Graham. \u201cI am going to try to let South Carolina determine who they want for their senator at this time,\u201d said Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, who has sparred with Graham over national security issues and civil liberties in the Senate. \u201cIt will be unlikely I will be involved. I haven\u2019t completely closed the door.\u201d Even the whiff of involvement by DeMint rankles Graham allies. Republican professionals were taken aback last week when the Senate Conservatives Fund, a political action committee formed by DeMint, unleashed a radio ad accusing Graham of not doing enough to stop the implementation of Obama\u2019s health care reform law. After the radio ad surfaced, Wesley Donehue, a veteran of DeMint\u2019s 2004 Senate campaign, took to Facebook to post a television ad from that race in which Graham appeared, defending DeMint after he was coming under withering attack from his Democratic opponent over a controversial tax proposal. DeMint\u2019s internal poll numbers were cratering, Donehue said, \u201cand Lindsey stepped up and stopped the bleeding.\u201d \u201cThat would have been a much different race if Lindsey hadn\u2019t got involved,\u201d Donehue said. What Graham\u2019s opponents need most is money, to boost their profiles among the roughly 400,000 Republicans who are expected to vote in the primary and to keep up with Graham\u2019s professional organization. All three of Graham\u2019s announced opponents have traveled to Washington to meet with the Club For Growth, a conservative organization eager to topple Graham that often takes sides in Republican primaries, but the group is staking out a wait-and-see approach to this race. In the meantime, Mace has picked up the support of a well-connected DeMint donor in Greenville, Bill Lowndes, the chairman and CEO of Tindall Corporation. Others in DeMint\u2019s network of financial supporters also are keeping an eye on Mace should she become viable. \u201cI don\u2019t see the other guy as being all that terrible,\u201d Lowndes said of Graham. \u201cHe is just not like Jim DeMint, and I just see her as more like Jim DeMint.\u201d The Graham campaign\u2019s near-term playbook is straightforward: Cut through the din and remind voters of his positions that do square with the conservative base. His aides point out that Graham earned a 92 rating from the American Conservative Union in 2012, has an A-rating from the National Rifle Association, and is opposed to abortion rights and same-sex marriage. Graham is also a colonel in the U.S. Air Force Reserves, not an insignificant biographical detail in a state with eight military bases and a large veteran community. A well-known workaholic, Graham hasn\u2019t had a real political fight on his hands for over a decade, but he harbors an obsession with the minutiae of South Carolina politicking, a fact sometimes obscured by his reputation in Washington as a critical Senate power player and a fixture on the Sunday talk show circuit. \u201cHis job is his lifestyle,\u201d Dawson said. \u201cAll he does is work.\u201d There\u2019s something else Graham\u2019s confidantes are fond of pointing out when asked about the prospect of a difficult race: He enjoys a brawl. His parents ran a small-town pool hall and liquor store in Pickens County, once the heart of South Carolina mill country. Graham was forced to raise his younger sister on his own after his parents died when he was barely 21. \u201cLindsey grew up in his family\u2019s restaurant and pool room in Central,\u201d said one supporter who asked to remain anonymous. \u201cIf you back him into a corner, he\u2019s likely to break a bottle and come out swinging. He jumps in the big fights in Washington because he\u2019s got a little country in him.\u201d",

            "article_content": "NEW: Obama says there are enough votes to pass immigration reform The president is rejecting calls to boycott the Olympics in Russia Obama says he will decide on a Federal Reserve chairman in the fall He outlines steps to improve public confidence in intelligence gathering President Barack Obama on Friday outlined steps to reform U.S. intelligence gathering measures after they came under scrutiny following their revelation by former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden, saying the classified leaks created a public distrust in programs meant to safeguard Americans. Since Snowden leaked secret documents to the media, critics have called the NSA\u2019s domestic surveillance \u2013 including a program that monitors the metadata of domestic phone calls \u2013 a government overreach. Many of those same critics have asked the Obama administration and Congress to rein in the programs. \u201cGiven the history of abuse by governments, it\u2019s right to ask questions about surveillance, particularly as technology is reshaping every aspect of our lives,\u201d Obama said during a news conference in the East Room of the White House. Documents shed light on U.S. surveillance programs But the president slammed the release of the information that has \u201ccome out in dribs and drabs,\u201d saying a general impression has taken hold \u201cthat we are somehow out there willy-nilly sucking information from everybody.\u201d At the same time, Obama sought to assure the public that there are safeguards in place, while acknowledging the need for transparency. Obama: 'Nobody is more offended than me' Obama: Doing the dishes to regain trust Chilly relations between US & Russia Obama: Russia must respect gay rights Among the steps being taken, according to the president: Working with Congress to pursue appropriate improvements of the telephone data program; reforming the secret court that approves that initiative; improving transparency to provide as much information as possible to the public, including the legal rationale for government collection activities; and appointing a high-level, independent group of outside experts to review surveillance technologies. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt Mr. Snowden\u2019s leaks triggered a much more rapid and passionate response than if I had simply appointed this review board,\u201d the president said. Snowden\u2019s e-mail provider shuts down amid court battle \u2018Take a pause\u2019 But Obama refused any characterization of Snowden as a \u201cwhistle-blower\u201d or \u201cpatriot,\u201d saying there were \u201cother avenues\u201d the former NSA contractor could have taken instead of leaking national security surveillance information. Snowden, who has been granted temporary asylum in Russia, has been charged with three felony counts related to the leaks, including violations of the U.S. Espionage Act. If Snowden believes his actions were right, \u201che can appear before a court with a lawyer and make his case,\u201d the president said. Snowden was granted temporary asylum in Russia, a move that further strained already tense relations between Washington and Moscow. Obama said that his decision to not go to Moscow next month for a summit was not solely related to Russia\u2019s decision to grant asylum to Snowden. He said the United States must \u201ctake a pause\u201d and \u201ccalibrate the relationship\u201d with Russia to assess where things stand, while \u201crecognizing there are going to be some differences and we are not always going to agree.\u201d Obama cancels talks with Putin ahead of G-20 summit Relations between Obama and Russian President Vladimir Putin have foundered over a number of issues, including their sharp differences over Syria, missile defense and, most recently, a new anti-gay law signed by Putin that could put gay and lesbian athletes at risk of arrest in next year\u2019s winter Olympic Games in Sochi, Russia. Since Putin\u2019s election as president, Obama believes there has been a return to some Cold War attitudes with \u201cmore rhetoric on the Russia side that was anti-American.\u201d President Barack Obama\u2019s plan to review U.S. surveillance programs has validated fugitive NSA leaker Edward Snowden\u2019s role as a whistle-blower, the head of the anti-secrecy group WikiLeaks said Saturday. \u2018No Olympic boycott\u2019 Obama rejected calls to boycott the 2014 Winter Olympics unless the law is repealed, saying it would hurt American athletes who have trained and sacrificed to make it to the Olympics. \u201cOne of the things I\u2019m really looking forward to is maybe some gay and lesbian athletes bringing home the gold or silver or bronze, which I think would go a long way in rejecting the kind of attitudes that we\u2019re seeing there,\u201d Obama said. \u201cIf Russia doesn\u2019t have gay or lesbian athletes, then that would probably make their team weaker.\u201d It had been more than three month since the president took questions from reporters in the White House briefing room, and much has transpired since then, including the recent closing embassies in Africa, the Middle East and Asia because of a heightened terror threat. If he headed out to his Martha\u2019s Vineyard vacation this weekend without addressing the issues, \u201cit would be seen as a mistake,\u201d said Candy Crowley, CNN\u2019s chief political correspondent. \u201cThe most immediate topic, I think, on his plate, has got to be what\u2019s going on in terms of terrorism and the closing of the embassies.\u201d Last week, officials shuttered 22 U.S. embassies and consulates for the day on Sunday amid fears of an al Qaeda attack. On Sunday afternoon, the State Department said it had extended embassy and consulate closures in 15 of the locations until Friday and later added four other posts to the list. The decision was seen as unprecedented from many in the diplomacy and intelligence communities. A senior state department official said Friday that the majority of those posts will reopen on Sunday. Al Qaeda threat On Friday, Obama declined to answer questions about reported U.S. drone strikes against militants in Yemen in recent weeks that have left at least 34 people dead, saying he would not discuss operations. The core leadership of al Qaeda has been decimated, but the terror group\u2019s offshoots \u2013 such as al Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula operating in Yemen \u2013 still possess the ability to threaten U.S. embassies and businesses. \u201cWe are not going to completely eliminate terrorism. What we can do is weaken it and strengthen our partnerships\u201d so it cannot pose the type of threat seen on 9/11, he said. Obama\u2019s administration has been under fire in recent months over its response to the attack on a U.S. diplomatic compound in Benghazi, Libya, that left U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans dead. Asked why Obama has not made good on a promise to get those responsible for the September 2012 attack, he said: \u201cI also said we would get bin Laden, and I didn\u2019t get him in 11 months.\u201d A sealed federal indictment has been issued in the Benghazi case, and \u201cit\u2019s sealed for a reason,\u201d Obama said. Immigration, health care Among the other issues Obama discussed during the news conference: \u2013 Immigration: Obama believes there are enough votes in the House to pass a Senate immigration reform bill, which would allow undocumented immigrants an opportunity to become U.S. citizens. The bill also increases border security and penalties for employers who knowingly hire people not authorized to work in the United States. \u201cI\u2019m absolutely confident that if the bill was on the floor of the House, it would pass,\u201d he said. House leaders have refused to take up the bill, saying it will not solve the immigration problem. Instead, they have proposed a series of issue-oriented bills, such as border security. \u201cI don\u2019t know a law that solves a problem 100%,\u201d Obama said. Opinion: Crunch time for immigration, budget fights \u2013 Health care: Obama warned against a Republican threats to shut down the government if it can\u2019t  defund the president\u2019s health care law, saying it was a bad idea. \u201cThe idea that you would shut down the government unless you prevent 30 million people from getting health care is a bad idea,\u201d Obama said. Meanwhile, Obama said the decision to delay for a year a portion of the health care law known as the \u201cshared responsibility payment,\u201d which requires businesses of a certain size to pay a fine if they fail provide health insurance, was drawing criticism because of the politicization of the issue. \u201cIn implementing the Affordable Healthcare Act, there are going to be some glitches,\u201d Obama said, adding the were the same kind of obstacles that the government ran into when the country was adopting Social Security and Medicare. \u201c\u2026That\u2019s true of a car company rolling out a new car. That\u2019s true of Apple rolling out a new iPad.\u201d \u2013 Federal Reserve chair: The president said Lawrence Summers and Janet Yellen were both highly qualified to be the next chair of the U.S. Federal Reserve, but said there were \u201ca range\u201d of candiates for the job. The term for Ben Bernanke, the current Federal Reserve chair, ends in 2014, and Obama said he will make a decision about who will replace Bernanke in the fall.

Rick Santorum and Sen. Ted Cruz address a conservative gathering in Iowa It\u2019s August, the dog days of summer, and President Barack Obama and Congress are making a break from the nation\u2019s capital. The president heads West for a quick trip on the economy that includes a visit with Jay Leno, while federal lawmakers begin their five-week summer recess. Mitt Romney, a couple men who might have hopes of being the next Republican presidential nominee, and a first-term congressman from Arkansas also will be political stories in the week ahead. 1. Taking it to the states While lawmakers may have left Washington for the sticky month of August, their political battles aren\u2019t taking a rest. The sniping over Obamacare, immigration and the budget is only set to amplify as outside groups hit states to rally supporters behind their causes. Like August 2009, when rowdy town halls across the country helped fuel the burgeoning tea party movement, health care will provide conservative activists with a rallying cry for smaller government and less federal spending \u2013 though this time around, Obamacare supporters are also getting into the town hall business. Obamacare battle heads to states Congress prepares for recess Is Congress getting anything done? Sen. Cruz focused on defunding Obamacare Organizing for Action, the advocacy group formed from the remnants of Obama\u2019s presidential campaign, will get started Sunday with community events and house parties pegged to the president\u2019s 52nd birthday. The Obamacare rallies, part of the group\u2019s \u201cAction August\u201d initiative, are designed to counter conservatives who are also darting across the country to push against the president\u2019s sweeping health care law. While the 2009 rallies loudly pushed elected officials to reject the president\u2019s plans, conservative events this year will advocate defunding the law, which was enacted in 2010 and deemed constitutional last summer by the Supreme Court. Some conservative lawmakers \u2013 including Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, Rep. Marco Rubio of Florida and Sen. Mike Lee of Utah \u2013 are using impending budget battles as leverage, vowing to oppose any measure that provides funding for the federal government that includes funding for the health care law. The measure funding the government expires September 30, setting up another Capitol Hill budget battle between Republicans and the White House. Other Republicans, however, have voiced opposition to threatening a government shutdown in order to gut the health care law. Boehner\u2019s juggling act: Killing Obamacare and avoiding shutdown Other groups hitting the road: the anti-Obamacare Tea Party Patriots, ForAmerica and Americans for Prosperity; and the pro-Obamacare Americans United for Change and Protect your Care. 2. Obama heads West With economic speeches in Illinois, Missouri, Florida and Tennessee under his belt, Obama heads west Tuesday to Arizona, this time to talk housing in a market that\u2019s seeing recovery after home prices plummeted. Phoenix was one of the worst hit areas during the housing crisis, seeing home prices drop more than 50% between 2006 and 2011. But things are looking up \u2013 a closely watched index out this week showed home prices there were up more than 20% from a year ago. CNNMoney.com: Home prices keep soaring But homeownership around the nation is still at record lows, and according to a report this week from a federal watchdog, borrowers who received help through the government\u2019s main foreclosure prevention program are re-defaulting on their mortgages at alarming rates. \u201cIn Arizona, the president will lay out his plan to continue to help responsible homeowners and those Americans who seek to own their own homes as another cornerstone of how we can strengthen the middle class in America,\u201d White House press secretary Jay Carney said this week. The speech is a continuation of the president\u2019s push to turn back to the economy and jobs, which Americans still rate as their top issues in public polling. Republicans have largely been skeptical of the new effort, casting it as yet another \u201cpivot\u201d that hasn\u2019t resulted in any new proposals. While out West, the president will also drop in on Jay Leno, taping an appearance on \u201cThe Tonight Show\u201d on Tuesday. He\u2019ll also visit servicemen and women at southern California\u2019s Camp Pendleton. 3. He\u2019s back! Mitt Romney is attending his first political fundraiser since he lost last November\u2019s presidential election. The former Massachusetts governor and 2012 GOP nominee will be the headliner at a New Hampshire Republican Party reception and fundraiser. The event will take place on Tuesday in the Granite State\u2019s lakes region, near Romney\u2019s vacation home in Wolfeboro, along Lake Winnipesaukee. The New Hampshire Republican Party told CNN that general admission tickets for the event are sold out. \u201cThe dinner will give Romney\u2019s many local supporters in New Hampshire a chance to see him again,\u201d Ryan Williams, an adviser to the New Hampshire GOP who worked on the Romney campaign, told CNN. Was Mitt Romney right about Detroit and Russia? Following November\u2019s election loss, Romney spent much of his time out of the public eye, but he recently re-entered the spotlight, holding a multiday conference in Park City, Utah, that featured several prospective 2016 presidential candidates and other national leaders, as well as some of the GOP\u2019s major donors. 4. Is the next race already under way? Two men who might aspire to be the Republican presidential nominee in 2016 head to \u2013 you guessed it \u2013 Iowa at the end of the week. Former Sen. Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania, who battled Romney deep into last year\u2019s GOP primaries, and freshman Sen. Ted Cruz will have prominent speaking roles at the 2013 Family Leadership Summit. The event\u2019s being put on by the Family Leader, a group that\u2019s influential with social conservatives in Iowa. Social conservative voters are a key constituency among Hawkeye State Republicans, and Iowa\u2019s caucuses lead off the presidential primary and caucus calendar. Santorum is well known and respected among social conservatives. Cruz, who was elected to the Senate last year thanks to strong support from tea party and other grassroots conservatives, is fast becoming a rising star on the right. Also speaking at the gathering: Donald Trump, who once again might be flirting with running for president. 5. Game on in crucial Senate battle Get ready for what could be another crucial and bruising 2014 Senate battle, this time in Arkansas, which could ultimately decide whether the Democrats keep control of the chamber. Republican Rep. Tom Cotton is expected to announce Tuesday that he\u2019s running against incumbent two-term U.S. Sen. Mark Pryor, who is considered one of the most vulnerable Democratic senators up for re-election next year. Cotton, who served in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, is considered a rising star in the GOP and is a favorite of many neoconservatives. The representative, who was just elected to Congress this past November, has been a frequent guest on cable news channels, including CNN. Next year the Democrats will try to maintain their majority in the Senate, where they hold a 54-46 edge (including two independents who caucus with the party) over the GOP. They hope to expand that to 55-45 following October\u2019s special Senate election in New Jersey, which they are favored to win. But they most likely will be defending 21 of 35 seats up for grabs in November 2014.",

            "article_content": "War of words between Rand Paul and Chris Christie reflects division among Republicans Paul represents conservative-libertarian wing of the party, Christie represents moderates GOP strategist predicts Republican primaries will look 'a lot like a cage match' Was Paul's 'king of bacon' comment about Christie's weight? A very public squabble between two top Republican politicians who might be leading contenders for the 2016 GOP presidential nomination has grabbed clicks online and airtime on cable news. The war of words between New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky over national security, civil liberties and federal spending is also a proxy for the bigger battle for the future of the Republican Party. Here are five things we\u2019re learning from their spat. 1. The fight for the 2016 GOP nomination is under way It\u2019s only the summer of 2013, but the intensity of the exchanges between Christie and Paul makes it feel like late 2015 in some ways, with the start of the caucus and primary season just weeks away. The back and forth started last week when Christie, at a forum in Colorado with other GOP governors, slammed Paul for his criticism of government surveillance to battle terrorists. \u201cThis strain of libertarianism that\u2019s going through parties right now and making big headlines, I think, is a very dangerous thought,\u201d Christie said. Asked if Paul was one of the people he was pointing toward, Christie added: \u201cYou can name any number of people and he\u2019s one of them.\u201d Fighting for the GOP's heart and soul? Republican family feud Christie picks fight with Sen. Rand Paul Paul pushed back. \u201cI\u2019m the one trying to grow the party by talking about libertarian ideas of privacy and the Internet and attacking me isn\u2019t helping the party. He\u2019s hurting the party,\u201d Paul said in an interview with CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer on \u201cThe Situation Room.\u201d Rep. Peter King of New York, who\u2019s also considering a run for the White House, also jumped into the fray with comments critical of the libertarian-leaning senator. \u201cHe wants to retreat from the world. He wants to isolate ourselves, go back to a fortress America,\u201d King told Blitzer on Wednesday. Senate rejects Rand Paul-backed plan to end aid to Egypt 2. This is far from over While this round may be finished, others are sure to follow. On Wednesday, Paul made a pitch for the two men to sit down and talk it out, hoping to ease tensions. \u201cI\u2019m inviting him to a beer \u2013 anytime he would like to come down and sit down at the pub right around the corner from the Senate,\u201d Paul said in an interview on Fox News, adding that proposed get-together didn\u2019t have to be in the nation\u2019s capital. \u201cWe could always negotiate a middle ground like Philadelphia maybe,\u201d said Paul. That didn\u2019t seem to fly with the tough-talking governor. \u201cI\u2019m running for re-election in New Jersey, I don\u2019t really have time for that at the moment. If I find myself in Washington, I\u2019ll certainly look him up,\u201d Christie said in a radio interview on New Jersey 101.5. \u201cBut I\u2019ve got work to do here.\u201d Expect the action to pick up again in the future. \u201cThis is just the beginning. This is not going to stop,\u201d CNN Chief National Correspondent John King said. GOP strategist and CNN contributor Ana Navarro agreed. \u201cI think we are going to end up with a Republican primary that looks a lot like a cage match,\u201d she said. 3. War of words illustrates bigger battle Sure, this is about 2016, but it\u2019s also about a much bigger fight for the future of the GOP. Most Republicans agree: Major changes are needed if the party wants to be competitive in future presidential elections. But a new poll of Republicans nationwide also indicates that there\u2019s little agreement on the direction the GOP should take. That\u2019s playing out in the fireballs between Christie and Paul: The New Jersey governor represents the more traditional establishment wing of the party, with Paul the standard-bearer for the libertarian and grassroots conservative/tea party wing. With losses in the last two presidential elections still stinging, two-thirds of Republicans questioned in the Pew Research Center poll say that the GOP needs to address major problems to do better in future presidential contests. Three in 10 disagree, saying the party just needs to address minor problems. Along those lines, nearly six in 10 say the party needs to reconsider some positions, with 36% saying the GOP needs to make a stronger case for its current policies. Rep. King: Rand Paul shouldn\u2019t be face of GOP But there\u2019s less agreement on what the path the party should take. By 54%-40% margin, Republican and Republican-leaning voters say party leaders should move in a more conservative direction, with four in 10 urging a more moderate direction. \u201cNot surprisingly, conservatives and those who agree with the tea party overwhelmingly favor moving in a more conservative direction, while moderates and liberals would like to see the party take more centrist positions. Yet the more moderate wing of the party is a minority generally, and makes up an even smaller share of the likely primary electorate,\u201d Pew said in releasing the poll. King said that ensures a \u201cspirited debate\u201d in the months ahead. \u201cThey have to deal with the immigration issue again. They have that ditch with Latino voters. Taxes and spending.\u201d McCain: Tough choice between Clinton and Rand Paul 4. Chris Christie doesn\u2019t pull punches Yes, we knew this. But this episode reminds us of how blunt Christie can be. While Paul seemed on Wednesday to be trying to bring the scuffle to an end, Christie held his ground. \u201cAt the end of the day, I didn\u2019t call him any names, yet he called me names,\u201d Christie said in his radio interview Wednesday. \u201cI just have to assume from that that he\u2019s just trying to get attention.\u201d Christie was talking about his initial comments that sparked the feud, adding: \u201cIt really had nothing to do with Senator Paul, but Senator Paul wanted to make it about Senator Paul,\u201d Christie added. Christie speaks his mind, which appeals to voters, and not just Republicans. While Paul has a higher favorable rating among Republicans than Christie, according to the Pew poll, Christie has crossover appeal with Independents and Democrats that Paul can\u2019t match. 5. Did Paul go there? Paul accused Christie of harming national security by hoarding federal relief money for Superstorm Sandy victims. Christie responded by calling on Paul to cut federal pork spending in Kentucky. \u201cBut I doubt he would because most Washington politicians only care about bringing home the bacon so that they can get re-elected,\u201d Christie charged on Tuesday. Paul responded later in the day on \u201cThe Situation Room,\u201d saying, \u201cThis is the king of bacon talking about bacon.\u201d Was there more to Paul\u2019s \u201cbacon\u201d comment than just pork spending? Paul advisers say it had nothing to do with Christie\u2019s weight, which was an issue when he first ran for governor in 2009. While it\u2019s not a problem for Christie as he appears to cruise towards re-election, it will most definitely come up again and again if he opts to run for the White House.",

            "article_content": "Rep. Steve King made controversial remarks about citizenship, undocumented immigrant children House speaker rebuked colleague at news conference, calling comments \"deeply offensive\" King doubles down, says his remarks were not offensive; criticizes Boehner Fate of immigration reform legislation uncertain in Congress House Speaker John Boehner on Thursday rebuked Iowa GOP colleague Rep Steve King for controversial comments on undocumented immigrants, calling the remarks \u201cdeeply offensive and wrong,\u201d and acknowledged the fallout makes it harder to reach a deal on immigration reform. King, when discussing a proposal to give citizenship to the children of undocumented workers in an interview last week with Newsmax, suggested many of them were drug smugglers. \u201cFor everyone who\u2019s a valedictorian, there\u2019s another 100 out there who weigh 130 pounds\u2013and they\u2019ve got calves the size of cantaloupes because they\u2019re hauling 75 pounds of marijuana across the desert,\u201d King asserted. Democrats immediately denounced the comments and Boehner released a written statement with similarly sharp criticism two days ago. But at a time when there is mounting pressure on House Republicans to address an overhaul of immigration policy, Boehner deliberately repeated the message before TV cameras at his weekly press conference. \u201cThere is no place in this debate for hateful or ignorant comments from elected officials,\u201d Boehner said. He added that what King said \u201cdoes not reflect the values of the American people or the Republican Party. We all need to do our work in a constructive, open and respectful way.\u201d Boehner and many other House Republicans are now backing a proposal that would allow children brought into the United States illegally by their parents to obtain citizenship. But King isn\u2019t backing off. He doubled down on Thursday, maintaining his remarks were based on facts. \u201cIf people were offended, were they offended by the number or my choice of the fruit? And, if so,  what\u2019s offensive about the number or that?  I can\u2019t imagine why it\u2019s racist and if I offended anybody it was drug smugglers and it doesn\u2019t trouble me to offend drug smugglers.  If I intended to offend anybody that would be the group,\u201d King said. After speaking on the House floor, King didn\u2019t seem fazed by Boehner\u2019s comments. \u201cWe know that the speaker responds to criticism in the press.\u201d King said, adding that he would have preferred Boehner to approach him personally before speaking to the media. Many House Republicans quickly recognized the potential political damage King\u2019s remarks could have on the GOP as the party works to regain ground with Hispanic voters after losing badly among the group in the 2012 election. California Republican Rep Jeff Denham, who represents a district with a significant Latino population, concurred with Boehner in a tweet. \u201c@SpeakerBoehner is right. Rep. King\u2019s comments are hurtful & disrespectful. Lone member\u2019s prejudicial statements won\u2019t derail progress!\u201d The American Action Network, a GOP leaning group, released a poll on Wednesday that found a majority of Republicans in King\u2019s district backed a comprehensive approach to immigration reform. Without naming King, Dan Conston, the group\u2019s spokesman, sent a statement stressing the public support for legislation. \u201cHopefully with knowledge like this, the most ardent opponents of reform will pause to consider what they can support and how they can play a constructive role in fixing this broken immigration system.\u201d King brushed off the poll, and suggested the questions were crafted to get a specific response.  He admitted his office has been inundated with calls since the public coverage of his comments, and said to date the reaction has been slightly more negative, with 55 opposed and 45 supporting his position.",

            "article_content": "NEW: President Obama takes on Republican foes, vowing to take matters into his own hands Obama reprises campaign themes of equal opportunity for all The president seeks to frame the political debate with major budget, debt issues looming An Obama goal is to put new pressure on Republicans to work with Democrats President Barack Obama vowed Wednesday to focus his energy for the rest of his presidency on the core tenet of his election victories \u2013 equal opportunity for all Americans \u2013 starting with campaign-style speeches on the economy that appeared to launch this year\u2019s budget battle with Republicans. Confronting the deep partisan divide over federal spending, tax reform and raising the debt ceiling later this year, Obama  told a large crowd at the University of Central Missouri in Warrensburg that reversing a growing inequality between haves and have-nots should be the top priority of Congress. He chastised Congress for inaction and vowed to take matters into his own hands during the remaining 1,276 days he has in office. \u201cWhere I can act on my own, I\u2019m going to. I\u2019m not going to wait for Congress,\u201d he said in the second of two speeches that kicked off a series of economic-themed addresses across the country. It was a sentiment he expressed earlier in the day during a speech to hundreds at Knox College in Galesburg, Illinois. \u201cThis growing inequality isn\u2019t just morally wrong; it\u2019s bad economics,\u201d Obama said. During the speech at Knox College, he blended populist imagery from his campaign stump speech last year with the criticism of conservative Republicans who, according to the president, only stood for repealing his signature 2010 health care reform law and slashing federal spending in an effort to shrink government. \u201cRepealing Obamacare and cutting spending is not an economic plan. It\u2019s not,\u201d Obama said, challenging the political right to work with him on budget and tax polices that promote economic fairness for all, especially the middle class and people aspiring to join it. Gearing up for health care exchanges: Crunch time for Obamacare His voice rising, Obama declared that \u201cthe one thing I care about is how to use every minute of the remaining 1,276 days of my term to make this country work for working Americans again.\u201d As the audience stood to applaud and cheer, he added: \u201cThat\u2019s all I care about. I don\u2019t have another election.\u201d Earlier Wednesday, White House spokesman Jay Carney acknowledged to CNN that a goal of Obama\u2019s speeches was to ratchet up pressure on Republicans to work with Democrats and the president, noting that \u201cin the end, members of Congress respond to their constituents.\u201d Republicans called Obama\u2019s speeches a retread strategy that lacked fresh ideas to further bolster an economy that everyone agrees should be growing faster. \u201cWe\u2019ve heard most of it before,\u201d GOP Sen. Richard Shelby of Alabama told CNN, adding that Obama\u2019s economic policies had failed. \u201cHe\u2019s a good politician,\u201d Shelby said of Obama, noting that the president was telling people what they wanted to hear. \u201cBut he\u2019s not doing what he needs to do to create good jobs.\u201d Despite slow but steady growth over the past four years, polls show many Americans are still concerned about unemployment and the economy overall even though indicators show an improving recovery and Wall Street is again in record territory. Two new surveys on Wednesday indicated less than half of Americans approve of the president\u2019s handling of the economy. Both polls, by NBC News/Wall Street Journal and ABC News/Washington Post, found more respondents disapprove of how Obama has dealt with the economy, which remained the top issue for the public. The first six months of Obama\u2019s second term have been dominated by issues like gun violence and immigration reform, with legislation on both currently mired in partisan wrangling, as well as controversies such as Internal Revenue Service targeting of groups seeking tax-exempt status. Reframing political debate His speeches Wednesday sought to reframe the political debate as the government approaches the end of its fiscal year on September 30 and a potential shutdown if Congress fails to overcome the gridlock that has become its trademark. Knox College is where Obama delivered his first major economic address of his national political career eight years ago, and he used the setting to emphasize progress made since then in overcoming the recession his administration inherited to launch a slow but steady economic recovery. At the same time, Obama said the challenges and opportunities of the 21st century demanded new thinking and policies to capitalize on America\u2019s potential and end the pattern of worsening inequality from previous decades. He called for Washington to focus on \u201crebuilding our manufacturing base, educating our workforce, upgrading our transportation systems, upgrading our information networks\u201d instead of what he labeled \u201can endless parade of distractions, political posturing and phony scandals.\u201d Obama was particularly tough on conservative House Republicans, whom he blamed for blocking progress on issues such as immigration reform agreed to by their GOP colleagues in the Senate. He said he would work with anyone with good ideas while using executive authority and calling on on business leaders, philanthropists, labor leaders \u2013 \u201canybody who can help\u201d \u2013 to push for economic changes promoting equal opportunity. \u201cI will not allow gridlock or inaction or willful indifference to get in our way,\u201d Obama said. Later in the day, Obama headed to the University of Central Missouri in Warrensburg for another address expected to focus on education. Looming budget battle Regardless of the political focus of recent months, the national debate was certain to focus on the federal budget this summer and fall. Pitched political battles over spending and taxes have dominated Obama\u2019s presidency, and Republican leaders spurred on by conservative House Republicans facing congressional elections next year are threatening hardline negotiating tactics over the budget and affiliated issues of tax reform and forced spending cuts known as sequestration that took effect this year. Both the Republican-majority House and Democratic-majority Senate have passed spending proposals for fiscal year 2014, but the measures bear little resemblance to each other in terms of priorities. Any attempt to reconcile differences through negotiation faces complications from related issues such as whether the sweeping government spending cuts that took effect in March and hit the military and discretionary accounts hard should continue unchanged. Another potential landmine is the opposition by conservative Republicans, including some GOP leaders in Congress, to funding the implementation of the health care reform law pushed through by Democrats with Obama\u2019s backing in 2010. Further complicating the debate is the certain need for Congress to authorize an increase in the government\u2019s borrowing limit, or debt ceiling, sometime this fall. \u2018The Boehner rule\u2019 House Speaker John Boehner has made clear that any rise in the debt ceiling would require an equal cut in government spending to get GOP support, a demand known as the Boehner rule as set by the Ohio Republican. Opinion: Will Speaker Boehner make history? The White House has said it will not negotiate on the debt ceiling, and some congressional Republicans balk at linking it to specific demands, such as cuts in funds for implementing health care reform, but insist that more must be done to reduce deficits and debt. \u201cI think holding the debt limit a hostage to any specific thing is probably not the best negotiating place,\u201d GOP Sen. Roy Blunt of Missouri told MSNBC. \u201cWhere we ought to be now is, we need more spending cuts.\u201d Blunt specifically called for reforms to popular entitlement programs such as Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security to reduce their costs \u201cso they last.\u201d However, Democrats and Republicans remain far apart on entitlements, long a target of conservatives seeking to shrink government, especially programs that they say lead to federal dependence. Democrats argue the government pension program and health care for the elderly and poor are part of a vital social contract that ensures the well-being of vulnerable citizens. Obama said Wednesday that  Democrats must \u201cquestion old assumptions\u201d and \u201cbe willing to redesign or get rid of programs that don\u2019t work as well as they should.\u201d He has come under fire from some liberals for already proposing a change in how the annual cost-of-living index for federal benefits gets calculated as part of a broad but so far unreachable deficit reduction deal with Republicans.

            "article_content": "Obama makes two-day swing to talk up the economy President to speak to former campaign organization that's pushing his agenda House to work on plan for children of undocumented immigrants GOP recruiting women candidates for next year's midterm elections President Barack Obama holds more campaign-like events on the economy this week after speaking on Monday to the group that helped him get a second term in the White House. Here are five stories to watch in the week ahead. 1. Taking the show on the road After two weeks in Washington, Obama will take his case on the economy directly to the American people. The president travels to Galesburg, Illinois, and Warrensburg, Missouri, on Wednesday to hold events on the economy. The next day, Obama visits Jacksonville, Florida, to speak again on the country\u2019s economic conditions. Polls indicate that the economy remains the top issue on the minds of Americans. \u201cThe economy, and the things we can do to help it grow and strengthen and secure and expand the middle class, has been, is and will be the central focus of the president\u2019s domestic policy,\u201d White House press secretary Jay Carney said on Friday. The push for immigration overhaul Liz Cheney to challenge GOP senator Liz Cheney's battle for Senate Senate confirms Obama\u2019s Labor nominee Carney would not confirm reports the president would also include a pitch for immigration reform during his Wednesday-Thursday swing, but he did repeat the White House line that comprehensive immigration reform would significantly reduce the country\u2019s deficit and expand growth. Maybe that\u2019s a hint. Obama says refund checks show Obamacare\u2019s success 2. Getting a little help from his friends Obama will team up with some of his biggest supporters, who hope to push the president\u2019s agenda over the next month. The president speaks Monday to Organizing for Action, the pro-Obama advocacy group that was spun off from the president\u2019s 2012 re-election campaign. The \u201cAction August\u201d conference, to be held in the nation\u2019s capital, is designed to plan the group\u2019s activities during the August congressional recess in support of the president\u2019s policy agenda. Obama grass-roots group almost doubles fund-raising haul OFA tells CNN it wants to keep a \u201csteady drumbeat going while members of Congress are back in their home states and districts.\u201d The top issues on the list: health care, immigration reform, gun control, and climate change. The president is expected to speak to around 200 volunteers, financial supporters and OFA and Obama campaign alumni. Later the president will dine with a smaller group of around 70 supporters and friends. This is the second time Obama has talked at an event put on by OFA, which was formed in January. When the president first met with the group in March, there was criticism that the group, which is registered as a nonprofit social-welfare organization, planned to grant special access to the president for top donors. OFA officials  vigorously pushed back against such accusations. 3. House starts work on its immigration reform plan Most House Republicans oppose allowing eventual citizenship for undocumented immigrants, but Tuesday they will begin taking action on a measure that could provide citizenship for the children of those immigrants. The House Judiciary Committee is scheduled to hold its first hearing on the topic of what to do about undocumented children. This follows comments last week from House Speaker John Boehner, who said Congress must deal with the issue. Boehner says House should address children of undocumented immigrants \u201cThis is about basic fairness. These children were brought here on no accord of their own. And frankly, they are in a very difficult position. And I think many of our members believe that this issue needs to be addressed,\u201d Boehner said at a weekly news conference with House GOP leaders. Boehner has made it clear the House will not take up the bipartisan immigration bill that passed the Senate last month, which does provide an eventual path to citizenship for most of the undocumented immigrants in the country. Many House Republicans consider that to be amnesty. But at a meeting of all House Republicans last week, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor suggested that children fall into a special category and shouldn\u2019t be penalized for their parents\u2019 decision to break the law. Boehner still has not said how the House would ultimately address the broader issue of the 11 million undocumented immigrants currently in the U.S. 4. Another showdown over Obama nominees? The Senate may clear Obama\u2019s two picks to the National Labor Relations Board, who were central to last week\u2019s major showdown that threatened to bring the Senate to a halt. Despite a breakthrough to get Obama\u2019s appointees to a vote, it\u2019s not clear how much support the nominees will get from GOP senators who have deep misgivings about the Democrat-controlled board.  One Republican aide predicted the nominees are unlikely to get more than the bare minimum needed to break a filibuster, but another said GOP senators would wait to learn more about the nominees before deciding. Senate averts \u2018nuclear option,\u2019 confirms Obama appointee Their chance for that will come Tuesday when the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee holds confirmation hearings for Kent Hirozawa and Nancy Schiffer.  As part of the filibuster compromise, they replaced two more controversial nominees, whom Republicans opposed because Obama chose them as recess appointees despite the Senate\u2019s insistence it was in session. Obama says he\u2019s glad Cordray \u2018finally\u2019 confirmed The question over the constitutionality of the recess appointments could be decided by the U.S. Supreme Court this fall. A committee vote is planned for Hirozawa and Schiffer on Wednesday and a final confirmation vote on the floor could happen Thursday, aides said. 5. GOP pitch to women voters On Tuesday, House Republicans will launch a new effort to reach out to women voters, dubbed \u201cProject Grow.\u201d  Led by the National Republican Congressional Committee, the House GOP\u2019s campaign arm, the program is part of the national party\u2019s strategy to expand its appeal following the 2012 presidential election. Party officials concede that comments last year from Todd Akin, the Republican Senate nominee in Missouri, about \u201clegitimate rape\u201d and controversial remarks from other candidates tarnished the image of the GOP among women. From the start, Liz Cheney\u2019s Senate run controversial Project Grow\u2019s goal is to recruit more female candidates and craft a message for all GOP candidates to use in the 2014 midterm elections. Currently only 19 of the 234 Republicans in the House are women. Last week House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi unveiled the Democrats\u2019 agenda targeting women\u2019s issues, which includes legislation providing equal pay and encouraging greater worker flexibility and affordable child care. CNN\u2019s chief congressional correspondent Dana Bash will have an exclusive interview Tuesday with the House Republican women leading Project Grow. CNN\u2019s Craig Broffman contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "House Republicans oppose the comprehensive bill passed by the Senate A key sticking point is the pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants Lack of trust is another obstacle, as GOP legislators remember the 1986 bill GOP Sen. McCain calls for the House to negotiate a compromise Two weeks ago, the Senate passed a comprehensive immigration reform bill on a 68-32 vote, with 14 Republicans joining the Democratic majority to send the measure drafted by a bipartisan \u201cGang of Eight\u201d to the GOP-controlled House. President Barack Obama pushed for the House to quickly take up the measure that would provide a path to citizenship for 11 million immigrants living illegally in the country while bolstering security along the Mexican border. The proposal also includes stronger worker eligibility verification standards and overall border entry-exit controls. However, House Republicans made clear Wednesday they opposed the comprehensive approach of the Senate and intended to consider the issue in a series of bills that will take months to reach final votes. Agreeing to disagree on immigration Political Gut Check - Immigration Bush: The immigration system is broken In addition, the House GOP caucus was deeply divided on the question of eventual citizenship for undocumented immigrants, with some calling for a path to legal status while others opposed any kind of what they labeled amnesty for those who broke the law. While House leaders warned the party faced political harm if it failed to act on immigration legislation, a vital issue for Hispanic Americans who comprise the nation\u2019s largest minority demographic, the piecemeal approach and divisions over the legalization issue portend a messy and uncertain future for the issue. Here are five reasons why: Bipartisanship necessary in Senate, not the House. A 60-vote majority is needed to push major legislation through the 100-member Senate, which means Senate Democrats and Republicans usually have to work together to get anything substantive accomplished. The House, however, does not often require such a super-majority.  As long as a simple majority sticks together, it can do virtually anything it pleases. Mix that rule with increasing ideological orthodoxy and a decreasing willingness to compromise \u2013 particularly within the conservative ranks of the majority House GOP \u2013 and you have a recipe for stalemate with the Democratic-controlled Senate. \u201cPassing any version of the Gang of Eight\u2019s bill would be worse public policy than passing nothing,\u201d conservative pundits Bill Kristol and Rich Lowry argued Tuesday in National Review Online.  \u201cHouse Republicans can do the country a service by putting a stake through its heart.\u201d In today\u2019s hyper-partisan political climate, doing nothing is the easiest path for House Republicans to take and even a bragging point for tea party conservatives who came to Washington to shake up the status quo. While moderate House GOP leaders call for passing some kind of immigration legislation to avoid a potential political backlash, conservatives in the rank-and-file say such fears are unfounded as voters will reward Republicans for opposing what they call a bad Senate bill. Republicans don\u2019t trust Obama on border security. Kansas Rep. Tim Huelskamp might have said it best. The two-term conservative Republican tweeted Wednesday that \u201ctrusting Obama (with) border security is like trusting Bill Clinton (with) your daughter.\u201d Ouch. Virtually every congressional Republican says the Mexican border needs to be properly enforced before Democrats get their priority \u2013 a path to citizenship for America\u2019s 11 million undocumented residents.  Sens. Bob Corker, R-Tennessee, and John Hoeven, R-North Dakota, added billions for Mexican border security to the \u201cGang of Eight\u201d bill. For a lot of Republicans, though, the issue involves trust, not money. They remember the last major immigration reform effort, in 1986 under GOP President Ronald Reagan, that also called for tightened immigration controls while giving three million undocumented immigrants legal status. They say the amnesty occurred but the tougher border controls didn\u2019t, leading to the much-worse situation today. Now they don\u2019t trust Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano to secure the border.  They also claim Obama\u2019s recent decision to delay implementation of part of health care reform showed the administration can\u2019t be counted on to fully enforce any law. By taking a piecemeal approach, House Republicans hope to secure the tougher border security they seek before acting on a separate plan that could provide legal status for at least some undocumented immigrants. In short, pass a border security bill now, and then come back to the legalization issue once everyone agrees the border is sealed. Democrats reject such an approach. The conundrum of citizenship/legalization While the Senate measure provides a multi-year path to citizenship for most undocumented immigrants, House Republicans made clear Wednesday they remained split about 50-50 on the matter. Reasons for opposing any kind of legalization range from punishing lawbreakers to political protectionism, with conservatives fearing that most immigrants given what they call amnesty and the eventual right to vote will lean Democratic. However, the issue of legalizing immigrants is broad and complex, creating lots of uncertainty. For example, the Senate bill would automatically give immigrants living illegally in the United States temporary legal status as \u201cregistered provisional immigrants.\u201d Only when certain border security steps had been taken could they apply for permanent residency, or green cards, as a step toward potential citizenship in process that would take more than a decade. Many House Republicans made clear they don\u2019t want any kind of legal status for undocumented immigrants until the borders are secure. Even those open to legalization don\u2019t want it to include a path to full citizenship. The labels and definitions of legal status will be a major sticking point in the continuing debate, but also could be a source of compromise. House Majority Leader Eric Cantor of Virginia told Wednesday\u2019s GOP caucus meeting that children of undocumented immigrants brought illegally to America through no fault of their own should be provided a path to legal status, a position strongly favored by Democrats. The backing of Cantor and other House Republicans for such a provision showed room for maneuvering exists. After meeting with Obama at the White House on Thursday, GOP Sen. John McCain of Arizona called on House Republicans to negotiate an immigration bill. \u201cWe are ready to sit down with you and negotiate and bring this issue to a conclusion,\u201d said McCain, part of the bipartisan Senate \u201cGang of Eight.\u201d Sweeping reform isn\u2019t popular with GOP in either chamber. There may be more Senate GOP support for comprehensive immigration reform, but not that much.  Only 14 of 46 GOP senators backed the \u201cGang of Eight\u201d bill heralded in its creation as a triumph of bipartisanship in a sharply divided Congress. Why should House Republicans be more in favor? Remember that all politics is still local \u2013 especially in the House. Many House Republicans represent ruby red districts with few Hispanics, where any path to citizenship is unpopular and the big fear is a primary challenge from the right. Which leads us to \u2026 The Hastert rule House Speaker John Boehner has made clear that the House will only take up immigration reform that is backed by a majority of its Republican members. That is keeping with the maxim of former House Speaker Dennis Hastert that prevented votes on legislation that lacked strong support from the controlling party. Democrats contend the Senate version would pass the House with a few dozen Republicans joining them to overcome opposition by most of the GOP caucus. While it is unclear if that\u2019s true, permitting it to happen would antagonize many of Boehner\u2019s fellow Republicans. \u201cIf the speaker allows a vote on any immigration bill that results in passage despite a majority of the Republican conference voting against it, then it will be interesting to see if he can muster the votes to get re-elected after the next election,\u201d Alabama GOP Rep. Mo Brooks recently told CNN.",

            "article_content": "NEW: House Republicans argue for and against legal status for undocumented immigrants NEW: GOP legislators say work on immigration measures will likely go on for months Former President Bush calls for a solution in a rare comment on a political issue GOP leaders refuse to hold a vote on a Senate version that passed with bipartisan support Immigration reform entered an uncertain new phase on Wednesday as House Republicans signaled some willingness to compromise with President Barack Obama and Democrats but rejected a Senate-passed bill and insisted they would take their time drafting their own version. Following more than two hours of talks on how to proceed, GOP legislators said the biggest question was whether to give the 11 million immigrants living illegally in the United States a path to eventual citizenship, as provided by the Senate measure. Participants in the Republican caucus meeting described a 50-50 split over the undocumented immigrant issue, with more consensus on the need to produce some kind of legislation to show the party\u2019s commitment to fixing a broken system and addressing concerns of Hispanic Americans \u2013 the nation\u2019s largest minority demographic. Despite the divisions on the undocumented immigrant issue, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor of Virginia told the GOP members that children living illegally in the United States through no fault to their own should receive legal status. Bush: The immigration system is broken Inside Man: Life of a migrant farmer Next step for immigration overhaul? House Judiciary Chairman Bob Goodlatte said he and fellow Virginia Republican Cantor were working together on a bill focused on children, which is a priority of Democrats pushing for immigration reform. At the same time, House GOP leaders made clear they intended to slow the process down by tackling individual components of the broad measure passed by the Democratic-led Senate last month with bipartisan support. Bush welcomes new citizens in soft push for immigration reform Prospect of political attacks That means taking up smaller bills on specific provisions, such as border security and employment verification measures, in coming months while also seeking a compromise within the caucus on providing legal status for undocumented immigrants. House Speaker John Boehner warned his caucus that Republicans would face political attacks if they failed to move legislation, according to several GOP sources in the room. \u201cWe don\u2019t want the White House to hope that we fail to make it a campaign issue,\u201d said GOP Rep. Michael McCaul of Texas. \u201cHouse Republicans want to do this on our terms, and not on the Senate\u2019s terms and not on the White House terms.\u201d Another prominent House GOP leader, Budget Committee Chairman Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, told his colleagues that doing nothing was not an option. The unsuccessful Republican vice presidential nominee in last year\u2019s election, Ryan made the case also pushed by the White House that immigration reform would help boost the American economy, participants said. Meanwhile, a group of bipartisan House legislators trying to draft its own immigration measure met for several hours on Tuesday night and would continue its work, said Democratic Rep. Xavier Becerra of California. The group is working on a comprehensive bill closer in form to the Senate measure and Becerra argued the incremental approach advocated by House Republicans wouldn\u2019t work. \u201cIt\u2019s better to eat your Wheaties and do it right than do it poorly and 5-10 years from now have to come back at it again,\u201d Becerra said. How immigration reform would affect 3 families Path to legal status The 1,000-plus page Senate immigration bill passed last month takes a comprehensive approach that removes the threat of immediate deportation for most undocumented immigrants and provides a path to legal status and eventual citizenship. It also includes stronger enforcement provisions including the virtual militarization of the Mexican border with almost double the agents, new technology and a longer fence, as well as requiring employers to verify the immigration status of workers and improved monitoring of visa holders. While the Senate measure passed 68-32 with support from 14 Republicans, House GOP leaders insist they will not bring it up because most of their caucus opposes it. Boehner has repeatedly said any immigration bill brought up for a House vote must have support from a majority of Republicans, and he repeated that guarantee to his GOP caucus on Wednesday. Democrats called on Boehner to allow a House vote on the Senate version, believing it could pass with unified Democratic support along with several dozen Republicans. Rep. Steny Hoyer of Maryland, the No. 2 Democrat in the House, said Wednesday that Republicans were \u201csplintered and confused\u201d on immigration, describing what he called a \u201cdeeply divided party\u201d that was \u201cmuch more into ideology than they are into solving problems.\u201d Opinion: Should the U.S. be more like Mexico? Midterms loom in 2014 The immigration issue will be significant in next year\u2019s congressional elections, with House Republicans under pressure from conservatives to oppose what the political right-wing calls amnesty in the form of a path to legal status and even citizenship for people who sneaked into the country illegally or overstayed their visas. \u201cOnce you start down that line, you\u2019re destroying the rule of law,\u201d conservative GOP Rep. Steve King of Iowa said after Wednesday\u2019s caucus meeting. He and fellow conservative Rep. Michele Bachmann of Minnesota described the GOP caucus as evenly divided on the question. \u201cThe real issue is amnesty. The whole game is about legalization, the status of legalization,\u201d Bachmann said. On the other side was Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, a Cuban immigrant from Miami, who told reporters that \u201cwe have different points of view.\u201d \u201cI hope we can also look at the 11 million people who want to legalize their status,\u201d she added. For Obama and Democrats, passage of immigration reform would mean following through on a promise to the nation\u2019s largest minority demographic  \u2013 Hispanic Americans \u2013 to reduce uncertainty for millions of them living illegally in the United States. Searching for the American Dream in Mexico Moderate Republicans, including most of the party\u2019s leaders in Congress, want a compromise that would represent a potential breakthrough for the GOP with Hispanics who voted overwhelmingly for Obama in last year\u2019s election. Earlier Wednesday, former President George W. Bush added his voice to calls for a solution, telling a ceremony for new citizens that the present system was broken. \u201cI do hope there is a positive resolution to the debate,\u201d Bush said in a rare public comment about politics since he left office.  While he refrained from taking sides, he sounded moderate in saying he hoped that \u201cwe keep a benevolent spirit in mind.\u201d \u201cWe understand the contributions immigrants make to our country,\u201d said Bush, a Republican. \u201cWe must remember that the vast majority of immigrants are decent people who work hard and support their families and practice their faith and lead responsible lives.\u201d White House keeps up pressure However, conservatives fear that legalizing undocumented immigrants means guaranteeing future electoral hardship for Republicans by adding millions of new voters who generally lean Democratic. The White House sought to keep up pressure on House Republicans, asserting Wednesday that the Senate immigration measure would boost the U.S. economy and help create jobs. A Congressional Budget Office report released in June indicated the Senate bill could reduce deficits by $175 billion over the first 10 years and by at least $700 billion in the second decade. The CBO, working with the congressional Joint Committee on Taxation, estimated that eight million unauthorized residents would become legal in the first decade. In addition, the CBO report estimated the bill would boost the U.S. population by a net of 10.4 million people by 2023 and by 16 million by 2033. \u201cThe benefits are clear. The fact that there is a broad bipartisan consensus behind this is clear,\u201d White House spokesman Jay Carney said Wednesday. \u201cIt cannot be acceptable, broadly and in the long term, that immigration reform would be blocked because some minority of House Republicans is concerned about a primary challenge from the far right. That\u2019s not a good argument. It\u2019s not a good argument politically.  It\u2019s certainly not a good argument economically,\u201d he said. Senate immigration deal includes tougher border security \u2018Fully comprehensive\u2019 On the House side, the bipartisan group working on an immigration package would require that border security measures be in place before any process toward residency for undocumented immigrants could begin. GOP legislators endorsed that strategy after Wednesday\u2019s caucus meeting. \u201cThe American people want our border secured, our laws enforced, and the problems in our immigration system fixed to strengthen our economy,\u201d said a joint statement by House GOP leaders that expressed distrust in Obama and Democrats to fully enact tougher security laws before legalizing undocumented immigrants. GOP Republican Rep. Darrell Issa of California told reporters the end result in the House would be \u201cfully comprehensive  immigration reform\u201d that would address undocumented immigrants. He outlined legislation that would provide some with legal status, such as those who served in the military and children of undocumented immigrants brought into the country illegally by their parents. While other immigrants also could be considered for legal status, those with criminal records should be kicked out, Issa said. Sticking points in the House debate include whether undocumented immigrants would be eligible for health care benefits during the years it would take to get legal status, and empowering state and local police to work with federal authorities in enforcing immigration laws.

            "article_content": "Rick Perry to announce his political future Monday Texas special session resumes to take up derailed abortion bill North Carolina could send governor abortion restrictions bill George W. Bush to speak on immigration reform Wednesday The issues of abortion and illegal immigration will be in the spotlight over the next week, but all eyes will be on Texas on Monday for a major player to announce his political plans. 1. Austin or Washington for Perry? Will Texas Gov. Rick Perry run for re-election next year for an unprecedented fourth full term in office? We should find out Monday, when Perry is expected to make his intentions known at an event in San Antonio in front of friends and supporters. Perry to announce political future Monday Showdown over abortion in Texas Rick Perry: Open to a 2016 run 2012: Rick Perry: In his own words Perry was originally planning to announce his plans by the end of June but delayed his decision after he called the state legislature into a special session to try to once again pass a controversial bill that would ban most abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy. The bill was sidetracked by a filibuster a week and a half ago by Democratic state Sen. Wendy Davis that grabbed national headlines. The conventional wisdom is that Perry is leaning against another term in Austin, as Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott, a fellow Republican, gears up for running. And if Perry doesn\u2019t run for re-election in 2014, the thought is that he would make another bid for the White House, in 2016. Can Perry overcome his last presidential run? But note that Perry has bucked conventional wisdom in the past. 2. Abortion battle resumes in Texas Texas state lawmakers on Monday will resume that special session called by Perry, with a state Senate committee holding a hearing on the abortion measure and the full Senate convening the next day. In the state House, Republicans have already passed the bill through committee. It heads to the full chamber Tuesday. Large demonstrations on both sides of the issue are planned starting Monday. Perry blames abortion rights activists for \u2018absolute anarchy\u2019 The push in Texas comes after other states have passed such bans in recent years, including Nebraska, Kansas, Louisiana, Oklahoma, Indiana and Alabama. Arkansas has a ban in place for pregnancies beyond 18 weeks, and North Dakota has the tightest restriction in the country at six weeks, when a fetal heartbeat can be detected. 3. And another one heats up in North Carolina The abortion issue will also be front and center in North Carolina, when state lawmakers return to Raleigh this week. The state Senate just passed a series of anti-abortion amendments that were tacked onto a bill that would ban Sharia law. The measures don\u2019t include a 20-week provision but would place increased standards on abortion clinics and limit health care coverage for abortions. North Carolina joins states legislating against abortion Davis: Gov. Perry has demeaned his office Perry: Filibuster senator was a teen mom The action now moves back to the state House, which has passed the Sharia law bill without the abortion restrictions. Meanwhile, Republican Gov. Pat McCrory has expressed concerns about how the Republican-dominated state Senate rushed the passage of the anti-abortion amendments but has not indicated whether he would sign the bill. 4. Rubio has a decision to make On the federal level, Sen. Marco Rubio is considering a request by anti-abortion groups to sponsor a bill in the U.S. Senate that would ban most abortions after 20 weeks, an adviser to the Florida Republican confirmed to CNN on Wednesday. \u201cI can tell you that the pro-life groups are asking Senator Rubio to sponsor the bill in the Senate. He\u2019s on a family vacation this week and will decide when he returns to D.C. next week,\u201d said the adviser, who asked for anonymity to speak more freely. Anti-abortion groups push Rubio on 20-week ban bill Marjorie Dannenfelser, president of the Susan B. Anthony List, said her organization has been leading efforts to recruit Rubio to sponsor the bill in the Senate. \u201cHe wants to, and that\u2019s good news,\u201d she told CNN on Tuesday. Susan B. Anthony List describes itself as a group \u201cdedicated to electing candidates and pursuing polices that will reduce and ultimately end abortion.\u201d Other anti-abortion groups are also urging Rubio to sponsor the bill. If he does, it would give the measure added media attention, as Rubio is one of the GOP\u2019s biggest stars and is considered a possible 2016 Republican presidential contender. But conservatives have criticized the first-term senator in the past couple of months for his big push for a bipartisan comprehensive immigration reform package that includes a pathway to citizenship for most of the 11 million undocumented immigrants in the country. The Republican-controlled House passed a similar late-term abortion ban bill last month, with only six Republicans voting against the measure and six Democrats voting for it. The bill prohibits most abortions for women beyond their 20th week of pregnancy. While the original House bill included an exception for cases in which the health of the mother is in danger, Republicans got strong pushback for not including exceptions for pregnancies that resulted from rape or incest. Republican leaders later added new language to include those exceptions. The measure is expected to go nowhere in the Democratic-controlled Senate, and the White House has threatened a veto on the legislation. 5. Congress returns with immigration fight waiting With the Senate passing a bipartisan immigration reform bill a week and a half ago, the spotlight has shifted to the GOP-dominated House. House Republicans meet behind closed doors Wednesday to discuss their next steps. Republican leaders in the House say the Senate bill, which includes an eventual pathway to citizenship for most undocumented immigrants, is a nonstarter in their chamber. House Speaker John Boehner insists that lawmakers will craft their own bill or series of bills, separate from the Senate legislation. Immigration reform looks doubtful in House as lawmakers quarrel The Senate bill, which passed 68-32, included a last-minute, bipartisan amendment, which called for tougher border security measures, to make the overall legislation more acceptable to Republicans. CBO: Senate immigration bill would cut undocumented flow 33-50% A bipartisan group is also working on a package in the House, though its proposals differ sharply from the Senate measure by making it harder for undocumented immigrants to get on a path to citizenship. The same day that House Republicans powwow, former President George W. Bush speaks about immigration at his recently opened presidential library in Texas. The title of the event: \u201cWhat Immigrants Contribute.\u201d The former Republican president tried but failed to pass immigration reform during his second term in the White House, thanks in part to opposition from members of Congress from his own party.

Rick Perry has found himself squarely in the middle of the national political conversation as he clashes with Democrats over a restrictive anti-abortion bill that has drawn thousands of protesters to Austin. The high-profile showdown \u2013 Perry this week called a second special legislative session to revive the abortion bill after Democrats blocked it with a filibuster engineered by state Sen. Wendy Davis \u2013 has re-focused attention on his national ambitions and raised the prospect that he might again run for president, even after his 2012 campaign flamed out in spectacular fashion. \u201cHow he handles this moment could affect his hopes as a 2016 contender \u2014 and his reputation as a leading figure of the Republican far right \u2014 as much as the inglorious \u2018oops moment\u2019 from his ill-fated 2012 run,\u201d veteran Perry chronicler Jay Root wrote in The Texas Tribune on Tuesday. Will Perry run for president in 2016? He first has to figure out if he wants to run for a historic fourth full term in the Texas governor\u2019s mansion, a decision he is expected to make public next Monday in San Antonio. Perry to announce political future on Monday Perry confidantes have been telegraphing for weeks that he is unlikely to make another gubernatorial bid, though they caution that he feels invigorated by the abortion fight and could change his mind at the last minute. Perry blames abortion rights advocates for \u2018absolute anarchy\u2019 Showdown over abortion in Texas Davis: Perry has demeaned his office Perry: Filibuster senator was a teen mom 2012: Perry: In his own words But his advisers also say that regardless of what he decides next Monday, a presidential bid is still within the realm of possibility. \u201cI do think that what\u2019s going on here in Texas shows that Perry has courage and is a principled leader, and ultimately this is a good fight for him,\u201d said Republican strategist Rob Johnson, a longtime Perry loyalist. Fast Facts: Rick Perry The second coming of Rick Perry could be laughed off as a fool\u2019s errand. Any casual observer of the 2012 race knows that Perry embarrassed himself on a Michigan debate stage by forgetting the name of a cabinet agency he wanted to eliminate and punctuating the mistake with the \u201coops\u201d heard \u2018round the world. It was the final straw for GOP voters after a string of disqualifying gaffes that Perry staffers later said were brought on, in part, by prescription drugs he was taking to help mend a painful back surgery. Perry on 2012: Politicians aren\u2019t perfect Democrats salivated at the prospect of running against Perry in a general election, figuring he could be easily tarred as an outside-the-mainstream social conservative too extreme for women and swing voters. Republicans involved in the presidential process, however, say there is very much political space for Perry in if he chooses to seek the GOP nomination in 2016 \u2013 even in a crowded field of candidates that seems certain to include a number of fresh faces and outspoken conservative darlings. \u201cI think he can do it,\u201d said Bob Haus, who directed Perry\u2019s Iowa campaign in 2012. \u201cHe learned a lot of last time and would have to start much earlier than he did in 2012. Starting earlier would give him a lot more time to debunk any critics and win people over again.  He still has an incredible success story in terms of luring business to Texas and economic growth. He still has got this great story to tell.\u201d Haus touched on a common theme raised by a variety of GOP activists and key players in the early caucus and primary states of Iowa and South Carolina: Despite his flaws, Perry\u2019s resume includes a laundry list of conservative accomplishments that dwarf those of his potential Republican opponents, especially those in the do-little United States Senate. When Perry returned to Texas full-time in January of 2012, he avoided national interviews but continued to focus on the legislative and economic agenda that had endeared him to Republicans in the first place. On the economic front, financial publications routinely rank Texas, with its low tax rates, as one of the top states in which to do business. Between March 2012 and March 2013, net job growth was higher in Texas than in any of the 10 largest states, according to data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. On hot-button social issues like the abortion debate, Perry has continued to step into the fray from the right. Earlier this summer, after tighter gun control laws were passed in Connecticut and New York, Perry tried lure firearm manufacturers to his state. Perry tries to lure gun manufacturers to Texas Perry\u2019s nuanced positions on immigration reform \u2013 he opposes a border fence, wants more \u201cboots on the ground\u201d along the border, and supports a \u201cthoughtful\u201d path to citizenship for illegal immigrants \u2013 hurt him among GOP primary voters in 2012. But Republicans ended up losing Hispanics badly by nominating a candidate, Mitt Romney, who staked out harder line immigration positions. \u201cWhat Perry said about immigration, a lot of that stuff is in the immigration bill, and to have (Democratic Sen.) Charlie Schumer adopt them is nothing short of spectacular,\u201d said Haus.  \u201cHe was very right and very correct on the issues.\u201d The downside to the Texas story \u2013 low high school graduation rates, poor access to health care, high poverty levels \u2013 is rarely mentioned by Republican primary voters. \u201cThere would be a lot of interest in Perry if he runs because he has kept himself out there since that last run,\u201d said Lin Bennett, the first vice chairman of the South Carolina Republican Party. \u201cThey are seeing what he can do. The abortion stuff, his state is doing well in job creation, and he was fighting to get the gun manufacturers to go to Texas. He is keeping himself out there and people have noticed.\u201d Filibustering senator: Perry has demeaned his office Perry has kept himself out there in other ways. Last month, he placed a call to Katon Dawson, the former chairman of his South Carolina presidential campaign. Dawson declined to characterize the nature of their phone conversation. \u201cWe\u2019re friends,\u201d he explained as he chewed on a pork chop at the Lizard\u2019s Thicket, a lunch spot frequented by Columbia politicos. \u201cYou don\u2019t spent that much time together without learning to love or hate someone. I guess I\u2019m on the like list.\u201d Of course, ambitious governors don\u2019t call their well-connected friends in early primary states to talk SEC football. The Texas abortion showdown has confirmed that Perry relishes national attention, especially on an issue he cares about deeply. But it\u2019s one thing to give provocative speeches at a Right To Life convention and push a bill through a Republican-dominated state house. Mounting a protracted national political campaign in today\u2019s hothouse media environment is an entirely different, and intimidating, enterprise. \u201cAs much as Republicans hate to admit this, it\u2019s the national narrative by the political press corps and opinion leaders that\u2019s going to be the most difficult bridge to cross,\u201d argued one of Perry\u2019s 2012 campaign aides. \u201cHe has to do some serious rehabilitation. It\u2019s much easier to argue he doesn\u2019t have a shot.\u201d Those in Perry\u2019s small orbit of advisers acknowledge the challenges of a second presidential bid but say that entering the race earlier than last time \u2014 when he jumped in with just four months until the Iowa caucuses \u2013 would give him time to polish his damaged reputation. \u201cHe is real job creator and he has bona fide social credentials,\u201d said one Perry confidante. \u201cIf he can start strong and stay steady, people will see the real Rick Perry that we all know in Texas. People are looking for leadership and they have short memories. Tiger Woods went out did a bunch of bad stuff, half the country was mad at him, and then he won a golf tournament and we all love him.\u201d The all-consuming burdens of a presidential campaign would be made considerably easier if Perry declines to seek another term as governor, current and former advisers said. In 2011, Perry was kept off the trail for a crucial stretch as he dealt with an outbreak of wildfires back home. \u201cThe mechanics of a presidential run are as important as the person,\u201d Dawson said. \u201cThe hard work, the raising of money, the ballot access, the CFO, the COO, the political organization. It is like forming a major corporation in six months, and if you haven\u2019t done it before it gets overwhelming.\u201d With the notable exception of George W. Bush in 2000, Republicans also have a modern tradition of nominating candidates who have previously run for the office. Of those names frequently mentioned as potential 2016 candidates, only Perry and former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum have run before. Senior-level aides to other potential Republican presidential candidates mention Perry as a potentially daunting and underestimated opponent in a GOP primary, though they questioned his ability to win the nomination. Perry: I\u2019m open to 2016 run Working in his favor: An impressive administrative resume, unrivaled personal political skills, a strong rapport with evangelicals and social conservatives, and a large Texas-based fundraising network \u2013 even though donors might be understandably skeptical if Perry comes calling about 2016. \u201cRick Perry is smart guy despite what happened during that debate,\u201d said a top aide to one Republican actively laying groundwork for the next presidential race. \u201cHe has good instincts, and he connects well one-on-one. You take that and put it in early states without running for re-election, that\u2019s a formidable candidate there. If he can raise money, then opinions will change down in D.C.\u201d A senior adviser to a different 2016 hopeful described Perry\u2019s blueprint for victory in three words: \u201cIowa or bust.\u201d The South Carolina primary electorate is not as evangelical-driven as it once was, libertarian-leaning New Hampshire proved to be a non-starter for Perry in 2012, and Florida could be off the table if hometown boys Jeb Bush or Marco Rubio run. But, this person said, Perry has little reason not to give it a shot. \u201cAnybody who can go out and raise $50 million, and is a good retail politician, he will sell in Iowa,\u201d the strategist said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t mean he is going to win. But this foregone conclusion that this guy has no shot in hell only helps him. To lower expectations that low is great. If he holds an event and 100 people show up and a reporter writes about it, that\u2019s a story.\u201d Perry himself has so far shown little inclination to engage in the 2016 speculation aside from keeping the door open to a bid. He recently declined an invitation to address a gathering of social conservatives later this summer in Iowa. The event\u2019s organizer, evangelical leader Bob Vander Plaats, endorsed Santorum before the 2012 Iowa caucuses. But he said he is no longer committed to any Republican and expects Perry to join the Republican battle in 2016. \u201cI fully expect Governor Perry to run for president in 2016,\u201d Vander Plaats told CNN. \u201cThat is my intel. He is going to run. I do think there is space for him. There is a lot of Iowans wanting the real Rick Perry to show up. It will be a whole new ball game.\u201d",

            "article_content": "NEW: President Obama says \"we just need Congress to finish the job\" The 68-32 Senate vote sends the measure to the House for consideration Speaker Boehner says the House will stick to its own version of immigration reform The Senate bill offers a path to citizenship for millions of undocumented immigrants The U.S. Senate gave final approval Thursday to a roughly 1,200-page bill that promises to overhaul immigration laws for the first time since 1986, creating a path to citizenship for millions of undocumented residents while ratcheting up security along the Mexican border. Senators passed the sweeping legislation \u2013 initially drafted by the four Democrats and four Republicans in the chamber\u2019s so-called \u201cGang of Eight\u201d \u2013 by a 68-32 vote. Fourteen Republicans joined a united Democratic caucus in supporting the bill, which is backed by the White House and has the potential to become the crowning legislative achievement of President Barack Obama\u2019s second term. In a White House statement, Obama hailed the Senate vote as \u201ca critical step\u201d toward fixing what he called a broken immigration system. He labeled the measure that now goes to the Republican-controlled House a compromise, adding that \u201cwe just need Congress to finish the job.\u201d The Senate vote included a rare adherence to old-fashioned protocol. Vice President Joe Biden presided in his constitutional capacity as head of the Senate, and senators voted one-by-one from their desks, calling out \u201caye\u201d or \u201cno.\u201d Next step for immigration overhaul? McCain: Immigration bill is strong Immigration overhaul passes Senate test Republican Sen. Jerry Moran of Kansas broke the drama of the moment when he mistakenly voted \u201caye,\u201d then quickly asked the clerk to make it \u201cno\u201d as the chamber erupted in laughter. Biden tapped his gavel and called for order. Before announcing the result, Biden warned against outbursts from the public gallery, but chants of \u201cYes we can\u201d and \u201cSi se puede\u201d broke out after he read the tally. Biden called for the sergeant at arms to restore order. \u201cToday is another historic day in the Senate,\u201d said Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vermont.  \u201cThis legislation will reunite families.  It will bring millions of people out of the shadows and into our legal system.  It will spur job growth and reduce our deficit.  And it will make us safer.\u201d \u201cThe time has come to act in the interest of all Americans,\u201d declared Sen. Bob Menendez, D-New Jersey, a member of the Gang of Eight. \u201cI hope that message will be heard loud and clear in the House (of Representatives).\u201d Historic ruling opens door for immigration for same-sex spouses Most congressional conservatives, however, remain staunchly opposed to the measure, and have declared it dead on arrival in the House. Obama warned in his statement that opponents of immigration reform will try even harder to derail it. Noting the broad support for the Senate bill from the business community, organized labor and others, he urged people to contact their House representatives and \u201ctell them to do the right thing.\u201d Republicans are sharply divided over the politically sensitive issue. In the wake of the GOP\u2019s crushing loss among Hispanics in the 2012 election, many top voices in the party have pushed for an endorsement of some form of a path to citizenship for the country\u2019s roughly 11 million undocumented residents. \u201cNo one should dispute (that) like every sovereign nation on this planet, we have a right to control who comes in. But unlike other countries, we are not afraid of people coming in here from other places,\u201d said Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, the most prominent Republican in the Gang of Eight and a potential 2016 presidential candidate. \u201cI support this reform. Not just because I believe in immigrants, but because I believe in America even more.\u201d For many of the GOP\u2019s strongest supporters, any path to citizenship for those who entered the country illegally is a form of unforgivable amnesty. They also don\u2019t trust the Obama administration to fully enact the bill\u2019s new border security measures, which are generally opposed by progressives. \u201cThere\u2019s just no way I can look my constituents in the eye and tell them that today\u2019s assurances won\u2019t become tomorrow\u2019s disappointments,\u201d said Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky. \u201cWe\u2019ll never resolve the immigration problem on a bipartisan basis either now or in the future until we can prove that the border is secure as a condition of legalization.\u201d Senate takes another step toward passing immigration reform Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, called the vote on the measure \u201clargely symbolic\u201d and predicted the bill would ultimately be relegated to the \u201cash heap of history.\u201d If enacted, the measure would create a 13-year path to citizenship for most undocumented immigrants, while raising the cap on visas for high skilled workers and establishing a new visa program for low skilled workers on America\u2019s farms. A recently added border security amendment \u2013 introduced by GOP Sens. John Hoeven of North Dakota and Bob Corker of Tennessee \u2013 would require 20,000 more border agents, complete 700 miles of fence along the boundary with Mexico, and deploy $3.2 billion in technology upgrades similar to equipment used by U.S. forces in Iraq and Afghanistan. The amendment also strengthens eligibility verification and border entry-exit controls. Most undocumented immigrants would be eligible for permanent residency only after the five conditions have been met and verified by the Department of Homeland Security. While Corker\u2019s and Hoeven\u2019s change appeared to sway some reticent Republicans in the Senate, top House Republicans remained opposed the overall blueprint. \u201cApparently some haven\u2019t gotten the message: the House is not going to take up and vote on whatever the Senate passes,\u201d said Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio. \u201cWe\u2019re going to do our own bill \u2026 and move the legislation that reflects the will of our majority and the will of the American people.\u201d House Republicans have indicated their intention to tackle the issue with several smaller proposals instead of one larger bill. Boehner repeated his pledge to block a vote on any immigration measure that doesn\u2019t have the support of a majority of House Republicans. Democrats contend the Senate version would pass the House if brought to a vote, with a united Democratic caucus joined by some Republicans. The speaker also refused to take a position on whether or not there should be some kind of path to citizenship for those who entered the country illegally. Democrats have repeatedly warned they will not agree to a plan that lacks such a path. Regardless, Boehner said he hopes the House will deal with immigration reform this year. \u201cI have made it clear since the day after the election that this political football should stop, and that the Congress should deal with this issue,\u201d he said.

            "article_content": "Democrats who support same-sex marriage are now playing on increasingly friendly political turf GOP leaders express dismay at ruling, but seem eager to be rid of a polarizing issue The political fight over marriage is felt most acutely, perhaps, in Iowa Moments after the U.S. Supreme Court ruled on a pair of same-sex marriage cases, the handful of Democrats considering running for president in 2016 stumbled over themselves in a rush of celebratory reaction, blasting out a salvo of congratulatory press releases and tweets. Rulings hailed as historic victory Voting 5-4 in each of two decisions, the justices struck down part of the Defense of Marriage Act that denied federal benefits to same-sex couples and cleared the way for gays and lesbians to once again marry in California. Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, whose husband signed DOMA into law in 1996, applauded the decision. Kamala Harris: Let gay couples marry now Attorneys to continue marriage push Perkins: Marriage debate 'far from over' Evolution of gay marriage support in US \u201cBy overturning the Defense of Marriage Act, the court recognized that discrimination towards any group holds us all back in our efforts to form a more perfect union,\u201d Clinton said in a joint statement with her husband, Bill Clinton. Maryland Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley called the rulings \u201ca powerful step forward.\u201d New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo said the opinions were \u201cgroundbreaking.\u201d Obama directs Cabinet to implement marriage ruling Their responses make political sense. Public opinion on same-sex marriage has shifted dramatically from the time President Clinton signed the bill into law almost 17 years ago, after the legislation was approved by overwhelming majorities in both the Republican-controlled House and Senate. In 1996, just 27% of Americans said gay and lesbian marriages should be recognized by law, according to CNN polling. By 2007, the number had jumped to 40%. Today, a majority of Americans \u2013 55% \u2013 say that marriages between gays and lesbians should be recognized as valid, with 44% opposed. More than two-thirds of young people support same-sex marriage, a recent Pew survey found. Poll: Majority backs same-sex marriage Democrats who support same-sex marriage are now playing on increasingly friendly political turf, a circumstance that prompted a raft of Democratic senators to reverse their positions on the issue earlier this year in quick succession. By the numbers: Same-sex marriage \u201cThe battle lines are now clearly drawn for future elections,\u201d said Lis Smith, a Democratic consultant who advises O\u2019Malley. \u201cDemocrats, like the majority of Americans, support freedom and equality. Republicans embrace the stale and exclusionary policies of the past. Like immigration and women\u2019s health in 2012, this is an issue that will haunt the Republican Party for years to come.\u201d Meanwhile, the court\u2019s rulings Wednesday were met with something less than unbridled enthusiasm by the GOP political class. \u201cMy interest in weighing in on this topic approaches zero,\u201d said one veteran Republican working on a 2014 Senate race when asked to opine on the cases. The reason is clear enough: Republican tacticians understand that winning modern races often means surviving the obstacle course of a conservative-dominated primary before having to appeal to general election voters who, nationally, view same-sex marriage as a non-issue. Republican leaders in Washington expressed dismay at the ruling, but seemed eager to wash their hands of a polarizing national issue that, thanks to the court\u2019s opinion on Proposition 8, will now be considered in state capitals instead of the corridors of Capitol Hill. \u201cA robust national debate over marriage will continue in the public square, and it is my hope that states will define marriage as the union between one man and one woman,\u201d said House Speaker John Boehner in a prepared statement. Opinion: Supreme Court got it wrong on gay marriage The political fight over marriage is felt most acutely, perhaps, in Iowa, where three state Supreme Court judges were removed from the bench in 2010 in a recall election after they ruled in favor of same-sex marriage in the state. Same-sex marriage: The financial impact Windsor: We won everything we asked for Prop 8 proposal: He said yes! Defending traditional marriage \u2013 between one man and one woman \u2013 has become an animating issue for Iowa\u2019s vibrant social conservative community since that initial ruling in 2009, and a litmus test for Republican candidates seeking their approval, either in contested primaries or in the state\u2019s presidential caucuses. At the beginning of last year\u2019s GOP presidential primary fight, Rick Santorum narrowly won the Iowa caucuses with the backing of a dedicated network of pastors and home-school families who rallied to his side because of his furious opposition to abortion rights and same-sex marriage. But other Republicans in Iowa say the party is consigning itself to minority status by failing to embrace the shifting opinions about marriage that Wednesday\u2019s court ruling seemed to ratify. What happens next? \u201cWe can\u2019t afford to create a litmus test for the party,\u201d said David Kochel, who steered Mitt Romney\u2019s presidential campaign in Iowa and said he was pleased with the ruling. \u201cThere are too many young people, and too many people who frankly care far more about other issues, and people in the liberty movement who simply have no problem with same sex-marriage. We have to maintain a kind of open-armed stance on this.\u201d But Iowa Republicans seeking their party\u2019s Senate nomination in 2014 aren\u2019t quite jumping on Kochel\u2019s bandwagon. None of them cheered Wednesday\u2019s decisions. The one Senate candidate who did celebrate was Bruce Braley \u2013 the likely Democratic nominee. Sam Clovis, a suspender-wearing college professor and former talk radio host running for the Iowa seat, blasted the DOMA ruling and said it opens the door to \u201cpolyamorous\u201d marriages between more than two people. While Clovis acknowledged that being a modern-day opponent of same-sex marriage presents a political challenge for himself and other Republicans, he said conservatives are fed up with being attacked by the left for simply stating their principles on the matter. \u201cEvery time you advance the notion that you are a conservative and that you believe in traditional marriage, you get hammered,\u201d Clovis said. \u201cPeople who have strong beliefs have been silenced. You can\u2019t talk about it except among your own friends.\u201d Opinion: For gays, progress stunning, fast For Republicans, the same-sex marriage rulings were something of a Rorshach test, exposing the almost timeless fault line between the party\u2019s pragmatists and its ideologues. For figures in the party\u2019s establishment like Kochel, the rulings were met with a sinking feeling that same-sex marriage is increasingly a settled matter for voters and a potent wedge issue that Democrats can exploit for political gain in battleground states and in national elections. Statements from the establishment wing of the party Wednesday were either risk-averse or nonexistent. Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Preibus issued no comment on the ruling. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell dodged a question about it. Wisconsin Rep. Paul Ryan said he opposes same-sex marriage but called for \u201crespect,\u201d \u201ccivility\u201d and \u201cunderstanding\u201d as people work through their \u201chonest disagreements.\u201d Most of the Republicans considering presidential bids in 2016 proceeded with caution, aware that their statements will likely be revisited if they ever become the party\u2019s standard-bearer in a general election. Potential 2016 contenders take a stand on Supreme Court rulings Florida Sen. Marco Rubio issued a nearly 500-word commentary explaining his opposition to same-sex marriage. But for outspoken conservatives who tend to get rewarded in Republican primaries, the opinions were greeted with fury \u2013 general election consequences be damned. Santorum, who is expected to make another play for the White House in 2016, attacked the \u201cactivist judges\u201d on the court. Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, a freshman senator who harbors obvious national ambitions, called the rulings \u201ca regrettable overreach against the will of the people.\u201d These harsh denouncements had the added benefit of stoking outrage among family values conservatives around the country who contribute financially to their causes. The mood was similar among Republican candidates further down the ballot, who are running in gerrymandered House districts where winning a GOP primary is the only victory that matters \u2013 providing little political incentive to side with gays and lesbians. Take this year\u2019s special election in Alabama\u2019s ruby red 1st Congressional District, where former state Sen. Bradley Byrne, a front-runner for the seat, wasted little time in hammering the court. \u201cI am disappointed in today\u2019s decision, but know that Alabamians stand strong in supporting our states\u2019 right to define marriage without intrusion from the federal government,\u201d Byrne said. In Byrne\u2019s hometown of Mobile, as in the rest of the South, there is less appetite for same-sex marriage than in other parts of the country. In the Northeast, 63% of Americans favor legal rights for same-sex couples, according to a recent CNN poll. In the West, 58% of Americans say the same. But in the Midwest, the number of people who approve of same-sex marriage is 51%, and in the South, it\u2019s 49%. Those also happen to be regions where Senate Democrats find themselves in potentially difficult re-election fights \u2013 suggesting that while opinions about marriage may buoy Democrats nationally and in swing states, the issue is more perilous for the party in places such as Louisiana, North Carolina and Arkansas, where incumbent Senate Democrats will be on the ballot next year.

The 69-29 vote set up a procedural motion immediately afterward to limit debate on the roughly 1,200-page bill, which would provide an eventual path to citizenship for millions of immigrants living illegally in the country. While some further amendments still could be considered, the measure appeared headed to a final Senate vote by the end of the week after the procedural motion passed in a 67-31 vote. Backers of the bill want the Democratic-led Senate to pass it with a solid majority to demonstrate growing bipartisan momentum as the measure heads to the GOP-controlled House of Representatives. McCain: Immigration bill is strong The compromise amendment by Republicans John Hoeven of North Dakota and Bob Corker of Tennessee would increase border security, a demand by conservative opponents of the immigration bill. Justices could put an end to hard choice for gay couples \u201cI hope our colleagues in the House of Representatives will follow the Senate\u2019s lead, and work to pass bipartisan reform that both Democrats and Republicans can support,\u201d Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, said before Wednesday\u2019s votes. Conservative GOP Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa, an opponent of the Senate bill, conceded it s likely to pass and called on House Republicans to make things right. \u201cI expect the House of Representatives to fix this miserable failure,\u201d Grassley said. Republican leaders say the House will consider the issue in several smaller proposals instead of a comprehensive single measure, a process that would allow more debate and votes on specific provisions. Earlier Wednesday, House Speaker John Boehner reiterated to GOP members that he opposes having the House take up any Senate immigration legislation, according to Rep. John Fleming. Fleming, a Louisiana Republican, said Boehner told the weekly policy meeting that the House would work on its own immigration bills. If enacted, the bill would create a path to citizenship for roughly 11 million undocumented immigrants while enhancing security along the border with Mexico. Among other things, the compromise border security amendment would add 20,000 border agents, complete 700 miles of fence along the boundary with Mexico, and deploy $3.2 billion in technology upgrades similar to equipment used by U.S. forces in Iraq and Afghanistan. Opinion: Protect rights of immigrant whistle-blowers The proposal also includes stronger worker eligibility verification standards and border entry-exit controls. Most undocumented immigrants would be eligible for permanent residency only after those five conditions have been met and verified by the Department of Homeland Security. Hoeven and Corker introduced the compromise amendment last week, saying it incorporated proposals from other senators to try to fix a broken immigration system. Grassley and other opponents argued the legislation amounts to an amnesty for immigrants who broke the law by living illegally in America. They argued the promises of increased border security before giving undocumented immigrants permanent residency would end up proving empty. \u201cIt does nothing to change the legalization-first philosophy and does little more than offer false promises that the American people can no longer tolerate,\u201d Grassley said. If eventually passed into law and signed by President Barack Obama, the bill would be the first major immigration reform since 1986, during the second Reagan administration. Grassley conceded he voted for the 1986 measure, which also called for increased border security, and called his support then a mistake he regrets. Farm bill failure portends problems for immigration in the House The 2013 version was drafted by a Senate \u201cGang of Eight\u201d composed of four Democrats and four Republicans motivated by political and policy needs. Both parties concede the nation\u2019s immigration system is broken, and some Republicans believe that GOP refusal to work with Democrats on the matter would mean a repeat of the 2012 presidential election in which Obama won a strong majority of the Hispanic vote. However, other Republicans fear that providing a path to legal status for millions of undocumented immigrants would bolster support for Democrats from the new voters. Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, the most prominent Republican in the \u201cGang of Eight,\u201d told CNN\u2019s Dana Bash last week that he understands \u201cwhy conservatives are upset.\u201d \u201cThey\u2019ve seen all these promises in the past that haven\u2019t been delivered,\u201d Rubio said. But the status quo on immigration \u201cis hurting America,\u201d he added. \u201cAnd if nothing passes, then this disaster that we have now, that\u2019s what\u2019s going to stay in place.\u201d Opinion: Why cops should back immigration reform CNN\u2019s Alan Silverleib, Ted Barrett and Deirdre Walsh contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "President Barack Obama seeks a similar second-term record as his first Immigration reform would be like health care reform of three years ago Ending Bashar al-Assad's rule in Syria would be this term's Osama bin Laden triumph The economy continues its incremental recovery If all goes according to plan for President Barack Obama, his two-term presidency may end up being a case of \u201csecond verse, same as the first.\u201d He won re-election last year by touting a first-term recovery from economic recession, as well as a major domestic achievement in health care reform and a major foreign policy triumph in taking out Osama bin Laden. Now five months into his second term, the priorities and potentially achievable outcomes appear to be a similar trifecta. Obama is pushing hard domestically for an overhaul of the immigration system that would be similar to the health care reform bill in its scope and appeal to the Democratic base. He also is increasing U.S. aid, including military assistance, to Syrian rebels trying to oust President Bashar al-Assad, an ally of Iran and Lebanon. Meanwhile, the economy continues to grow slowly but consistently, with the Federal Reserve signaling last week that it intended to end stimulus policies adopted in response to the recession inherited by Obama when he became president in 2009. The president has other objectives, including executive actions to reduce carbon emissions he plans to announce Tuesday as part of a second-term push on climate change. A major push of his first term included a sharp reduction over time in auto emissions. His critics, especially conservative Republicans, will continue opposing his priorities and attacking his administration for what they call overreach and excesses that they say demonstrate the perils of a big government philosophy. Obama comments on Snowden case Obama in Europe: a lukwarm reception? McCain: Middle East about to 'erupt' In a statement on Monday, the Republican National Committee listed controversies from the Obama presidency \u2013 the government-aided Solyndra solar panel firm that went bankrupt; the Internal Revenue Service targeting of conservative groups seeking tax-exempt status; and wasteful spending by the IRS and the General Services Administration \u2013 as examples of big government gone wild. \u201cObama may not like the big vs. small government debate, but his scandals are tied to a government that keeps growing,\u201d the RNC statement said. Dominating the Washington agenda this week is the immigration reform bill drafted by a bipartisan group of senators in an attempt to resolve a bitter debate over 11 million people living illegally in the country. The proposal offers a pathway to eventual citizenship for undocumented immigrants while strengthening border, visa and employment controls in an attempt to bridge what for years has been a political chasm. However, divisions among congressional Republicans remain the biggest threat to passage of the measure. Conservatives oppose offering legal status to those living illegally in the country, calling such a move an amnesty for lawbreakers. They want tougher border security measures, and continually criticize the bipartisan Senate proposal as similar to what they call the too-broad and misguided health care reform law passed by Democrats with no GOP support in 2010. However, moderate Republicans want to avoid another electoral drubbing by Hispanic voters as occurred last year, when Obama won a huge majority of the nation\u2019s largest minority demographic in defeating GOP nominee Mitt Romney. They consider the bipartisan Senate proposal as their best chance to finally move past their party\u2019s anti-immigrant stigma, while conservatives call such a move a trap for Republicans because they believe most of the newly legal voters under the law would be Democrats. U.S. Census figures show the growing political voice of minorities in the United States, particularly Hispanics \u2013 the largest minority demographic at roughly 17% of the population. Almost half of the country\u2019s children under age five are minorities, portending a near future in which non-whites outnumber whites. Already, five states have a larger percentage of minorities than white residents. While the Democratic-majority Senate is expected to pass the bipartisan immigration measure with support from a dozen or so Republicans, the GOP-led House remains much more hostile to a broad immigration bill. Opponents in the House want to slow the momentum built by a bipartisan compromise in the Senate announced last week that appeared to ensure support from a solid majority of senators. House conservatives call for breaking up the legislation into smaller pieces, rather than voting on a comprehensive proposal that includes both the border protection measures they want and the \u201clegal status\u201d provisions they oppose. \u201cIf you look through history, we don\u2019t do big things very well in Washington, so I think it\u2019s better to break it apart, do smaller pieces, have a heavy debate about it,\u201d GOP Rep. Mike Kelly of Pennsylvania told ABC on Sunday. Referring to the health care reform bill still despised by Republicans three years after becoming law, Kelly said \u201cany time you rush anything through that big \u2013 this was up to 1,100 pages \u2013 I doubt that anybody\u2019s really read it and been able to really get through piece of it.\u201d House Speaker John Boehner said last week he would refuse to introduce an immigration bill unless it had support from a majority of Republicans. However, it appeared that the only way the bipartisan Senate plan could pass the House would be if it received strong support from Democrats bolstered by backing from a minority of Republicans. Democratic Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York, a member of the bipartisan \u201cGang of Eight\u201d that drafted the immigration plan, warned that any attempt by House Republicans to stall or block the issue would bring a strong public backlash. \u201cWe have all kinds of allies who are usually conservative pushing for this bill \u2013 the business community, the high-tech community, the evangelical community, the Catholic bishops, the growers throughout the  country,\u201d Schumer told CNN on Sunday, adding: \u201cI think they\u2019re going to have to act whether they have a majority of Republicans or not.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Opposition to immigration reform appears to be hardening in the House Failure to pass farm bill in the House demonstrated divisions in GOP ranks Roughly a quarter of House Republicans broke ranks with Speaker Boehner Boehner recently compared immigration reform to Obamacare Momentum in the Senate may be building for passage of a comprehensive immigration reform bill after a border security deal was announced this week, but House GOP opposition to immigration legislation remains the biggest roadblock to a bill getting to the president\u2019s desk, and that opposition only appears to be hardening. Senate immigration deal includes tougher border security The messy demise of the farm bill on the House floor on Thursday demonstrated the divisions within GOP ranks and the willingness of dozens of rank-and-file members to ignore their leadership.  While there\u2019s not a clear parallel between that bill\u2019s failure and the road ahead for immigration reform, the episode does underline the exceedingly tough task House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, faces as he attempts to guide immigration legislation through the House. Boehner insists he wants to tackle immigration reform, but hasn\u2019t been clear about how he intends to navigate the controversial issue through his own conference. CNN Poll: Big generational divide in immigration battle Border security added to immigration bill McCain: 'Complete the dang fence' Rubio: Immigration bill good for economy Rubio backs border security plan \u201cAfter all this talk about the Senate there has been so little focus on the House and that it has been, pre-farm vote \u2013 and will continue to be post-farm vote \u2013 the choke point for any immigration reform, \u201d Amy Walter, national editor of the Cook Political Report told CNN. House GOP leaders knew many conservatives would vote against the farm bill because they viewed the food-stamp programs as too expensive.  But 62 members, roughly a quarter of all House Republicans, broke with Boehner, who made a rare endorsement of the bill, and joined with the vast majority of House Democrats to take down the bill.  Even if Democrats produced the level of support Republicans say they anticipated, GOP leaders still didn\u2019t have support within their own ranks to get the farm bill through. The farm bill\u2019s defeat \u201cexposed the vulnerabilities of so called compromise legislation in the House,\u201d Walter added. But even before the farm bill fiasco Boehner began pouring cold water on the immigration momentum coming out of the Senate.  As news was breaking on the Senate deal on Thursday morning Boehner compared immigration reform to Obamacare, the bill Republicans constantly malign as the prime example of government overreach. \u201cEvery day as Obamacare is being implemented, Americans are reminded of what happens when you have big legislation rammed through Congress with minimum support,\u201d Boehner said at his weekly news conference.  \u201cAmericans\u2019 confidence in their government is near an all-time low, so if immigration reform is going to work it\u2019s essential that we have the confidence of the American people and that it\u2019s done the right way,\u201d the speaker added. The deliberate move to put immigration in the same category as Obamacare showed Boehner is in no mood to muscle through a massive immigration overhaul unless it can garner significant votes from both sides of the aisle \u2013 a tall order in the House. Boehner didn\u2019t comment directly on the new \u201cborder surge\u201d provisions that would double the number of agents on the U.S.-Mexico border or the new money to construct a 700-mile-long fence.  But he raised questions on whether that plan would be enough to address concerns among conservatives, saying, \u201cIf we\u2019re going to get the kind of bipartisan support I think we need, and we\u2019re not going to get that confidence unless the American people look up and say, \u2018Yes, this border security package meets the straight-face test.\u2019 \u201c Another key House GOP player on immigration reform, Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte, R-Virginia, was skeptical that the Senate\u2019s border security plan was going to work, telling reporters, \u201cJust throwing bodies at it\u201d does not solve the problem. Goodlatte said the larger issue is addressing the 35%-45% of the 11 million people in the U.S. without legal status who he says enter the country lawfully \u2013 through visas, but are allowed to overstay or gain a waiver to remain.  He argued there has to be a bigger emphasis on interior enforcement programs.  And Goodlatte repeated his intention to move immigration reform through a \u201cstep by step\u201d process instead of the sort of comprehensive bill the Senate is considering. Navarrette: Border security push is a joke \u201cAnything attached to a path to citizenship even if it secures the border I wouldn\u2019t support it,\u201d Pennsylvania Republican Rep. Lou Barletta said when asked by CNN about the Senate\u2019s new border security plan.  Barletta said he could support additional resources but said he wanted \u201ca guarantee\u201d that enforcement measures in fact worked, and he thought what the Senate was doing would end up speeding up eventual citizenship for undocumented workers, something he said was unacceptable. \u201cI don\u2019t have any confidence that it\u2019s ever going to be implemented, \u201d Iowa Republican Rep. Steve King told CNN when asked about the Senate border security plan, saying he didn\u2019t believe Secretary of Homeland Security Janet Napolitano would follow the law. The dynamic inside the House Republican conference on immigration could be seen outside the Capitol on Wednesday afternoon with two groups delivering polar opposite messages about immigration policy. House GOP Conference Chair Cathy McMorris Rogers, R-Washington, held a news conference with several House Republicans and a group of Hispanic religious leaders and stressed the party\u2019s outreach efforts to Latinos on immigration.  Just yards away, the loud voices of a hundreds of activists opposed to a path to citizenship \u2013 branded \u201camnesty\u201d \u2013 could be heard at an event King organized. Boehner already made it clear earlier in the week that he would only move an immigration bill if it had the support of the majority of House Republicans.  But even if he gets more than half of the 234 House GOP members, he\u2019ll still needs to rely on House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi to get most of her members on board to pass a bill. Democratic support for immigration reform has never been in question.  But House Republican congressional aides, still incensed about the failure of the farm bill, question whether Democrats on Capitol Hill are more focused on scoring political points in the next election than joining with them to pass a bill. \u201cHow are we supposed to trust a promise or a whip count from House Democrats now?\u201d one senior House GOP leadership aide said when asked about what the farm bill\u2019s defeat means on immigration. Walter noted that all along many Republicans on the Hill have been suspicious about how serious congressional Democrats were about actually getting an immigration bill over the finish line. \u201cIt speaks to this deep seeded belief among many Republicans that Democrats are going to pull the rug out from them and use it to beat them about the head in 2014,\u201d Walter explained to CNN. The Senate could be on track to pass its immigration package before July 4, but the bipartisan group in the House that has been working for months on a similar proposal hasn\u2019t been able to finalize their deal yet. The House Judiciary Committee has begun working on more narrow proposals aimed at enforcement and security, and those could come up for votes as early as next month. Even those in the House who are pressing for major immigration reform say it\u2019s unlikely to play out in the House until later this fall. But that schedule poses difficult decisions for Boehner about how to move immigration as it comes around the same time as the House has to deal with an equally divisive issue \u2013 addressing how to deal with the country\u2019s debt limit.

            "article_content": "NEW: Deal says no green cards for undocumented immigrants before border security steps GOP Sen. Flake expects a dozen more Republican votes due to the changes The deal would double the number of border patrol agents The goal is to increase pressure on House Republicans to pass an immigration bill A border agent every 1,000 feet, every hour of every day, supported by 700 miles of fencing along the Mexican frontier. No green cards for the 11 million immigrants living illegally in America until those steps and others to enhance border controls are taken. And none of it increases the federal deficit or debt. A bipartisan group of senators unveiled a compromise on Thursday intended to ensure Senate passage of a major immigration reform bill with enough Republican support to persuade the GOP-controlled House to also take up the measure that is a priority of President Barack Obama. Rubio backs border security plan Rubio: Immigration bill good for economy Analysis: Will GOP vote for immigration? Rep. Castro: Immigration bill will pass The bipartisan amendment would require 20,000 more border agents, completing 700 miles of fence along the boundary with Mexico, and deploying $3.2 billion in technology upgrades similar to equipment used by U.S. forces in Iraq and Afghanistan. The proposal, negotiated by a group of senators from both parties known as the \u201cGang of Eight,\u201d also insists on stronger worker verification and border entry-exit controls. Only after those five conditions have been met and verified by the Department of Homeland Security can undocumented immigrants get permanent residency, supporters said. GOP Sens. John Hoeven of North Dakota and Bob Corker of Tennessee introduced the compromise amendment, saying it incorporated proposals from other senators to try to fix a broken immigration system. Hoeven noted the bill would allow immigrants now living illegally in the country to get temporary legal status as \u201cregistered provisional immigrants,\u201d but the increased security measures must be in place before they can get green cards to make them permanent residents. Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, a member of the \u201cGang of Eight,\u201d noted it would take \u201ca couple of years\u201d to train and deploy the new agents in an expansion that would almost double the current force. The Department of Homeland Security would verify when the triggers for improved border security had been met to begin issuing green cards, Graham added. He also said the measure  would include increased fees and other mechanisms to pay for the cost expected to exceed $30 billion, citing a Congressional Budget Office report that showed the broader immigration measure would bring in $197 billion in revenue over the next 10 years. \u201cI am very pleased to support what I think is the most dramatic amendment in the history of our country to get our borders secured,\u201d Graham said. However, some conservative GOP senators remained skeptical that the proposal would address their concerns. Alabama Sen. Jeff Sessions said the compromise means \u201camnesty will occur,\u201d and he complained that despite all the promises made by its sponsors and supporters, no written version had been produced so far. Sessions also noted that the compromise only came about in reaction to revelations about shortcomings in the original bill uncovered by critics including himself. Roy Beck, president of a group that opposes the immigration reform measure, called the compromise \u201ca desperate political move by pro-amnesty forces to provide cover to pass a bill that would otherwise not pass.\u201d The amendment \u201callows the massive increase in foreign workers that the CBO says will lower American wages and increase unemployment,\u201d said Beck, president of NumbersUSA. In contrast, GOP members of the \u201cGang of Eight\u201d said they supported the plan. Veteran Sen. John McCain of Arizona said Congress must resolve the issue of 11 million undocumented immigrants \u201cliving in the shadows\u201d under the current broken system. Citing the nation\u2019s \u201cJudeo-Christian\u201d tradition, McCain asked if it was \u201cin our nation to come together and pass this legislation and not come up with reasons for not doing it.\u201d Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake noted that he expected the compromise amendment would persuade a dozen or so Republicans to support the overall bill. \u201cThis border security package will bring on a number of Republicans,\u201d Flake said. \u201cWe\u2019ve always said the bill would be improved through the process and this is part of that improvement.\u201d Supporters want to win at least 70 votes in the 100-member Senate, hoping such a solid majority would give the measure much-needed momentum in the GOP-controlled House. Earlier this week, House Speaker John Boehner rejected having the GOP-controlled chamber vote on an immigration measure if it needed Democratic votes to pass. \u201cI don\u2019t see any way of bringing an immigration bill to the floor that doesn\u2019t have majority support of Republicans,\u201d Boehner, R-Ohio, told reporters. Castro: GOP border security demands on immigration bill are \u2018not realistic\u2019 Conservative Republicans oppose the plan as written because it provides a pathway to citizenship for most of the 11 million immigrants living illegally in the United States. They call such a move an amnesty for lawbreakers, and they fear the influx of likely Democratic voters in future elections. In addition, they reject the measure as a \u201cbig government\u201d approach that will increase pressure on entitlement programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. More moderate GOP leaders and legislators believe Republicans risk worse electoral damage if the party is blamed for blocking immigration reform. Read: Senate negotiators seek new compromise on immigration In last year\u2019s election, Obama won a strong majority of the Hispanic vote in defeating GOP nominee Mitt Romney, and Republican strategists warn of similar results if the party is considered hostile to immigrants. Conservative Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, another Republican in the \u201cGang of Eight,\u201d said the alternative to immigration reform was keeping in place a broken system that has led to problems cited by opponents of the legislation. The first-term senator, who\u2019s widely considered a potential 2016 contender for the GOP presidential nomination, told CNN that he\u2019s not concerned about the political risk of tying his name so closely to such controversial legislation. \u201cThe easiest thing to do politically is just not deal with the issue \u2013 you know, give a couple speeches, and not play and get involved and try to solve it,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cI\u2019m dealing with this because this is hurting our country badly.\u201d Earlier, Vice President Joe Biden made an impassioned appeal for immigration reform on Thursday, telling a prayer breakfast with Latino leaders that \u201cit\u2019s time we pass fair \u2013 firm but fair \u2013 reforms to bring these 11 million undocumented immigrants out of the shadows.\u201d Opinion: Why cops should back immigration reform Calling the legislation \u201cthe morally right thing to do,\u201d Biden said \u201cit is not hyperbole in my view to suggest, that for the people we care about, we\u2019re at the cusp in our generation of making hope and history rhyme.\u201d McCain: Immigration reform won\u2019t hurt GOP at polls A CNN/ORC International poll released this week showed that a solid majority of respondents \u2013 62% \u2013 think border security should be the main focus of immigration legislation, with 36% saying the legislation should emphasize a path to citizenship for immigrants living illegally in the country. The poll showed Democrats divided evenly on the question, while independents and Republicans strongly called for a focus on border security.

            "article_content": "31-year-old state chair's resume includes a number of GOP politicians and organizations Matt Moore says party's efforts to attract younger voters starts with its message Chairman predicts this is not the year of immigration reform, given country's polarization When the chairman of the South Carolina Republican Party abruptly resigned two weeks ago to take a new job in Washington, GOP activists appointed Matt Moore, the party\u2019s former executive director, to replace their leader. Moore earned another distinction in the process. The boyish-looking 31-year-old is now the youngest state party chairman in the country, in either party. At first glance, Moore takes over a party organization in terrific shape. South Carolina Republicans control all nine statewide offices and six of the state\u2019s seven congressional seats. In May, Sanford handily won a special congressional election despite being badly outspent by Democrat Elizabeth Colbert-Busch and her national allies. Mitt Romney beat Barack Obama in the Palmetto State by 10 points. But beneath the surface lie a number of challenges. State Republicans are grappling with a long-standing flame war between libertarian activists and the party establishment, a conflict that may rear its head next year as Sen. Lindsey Graham seeks re-election. In the state legislature, conservatives recently teamed with Democrats to scuttle Republican Gov. Nikki Haley\u2019s attempt at ethics reform. There are also financial worries: the party has less than $40,000 in the bank and is struggling to repay a six-figure loan taken out in 2012. Despite looking more like a college Republican than a party boss, Moore comes to the position with considerable Republican pedigree \u2013 experience he\u2019ll need to confront those problems. Moore has the added burden of steering one of the GOP\u2019s most important state parties, an organization that finds itself at the center of national politics every four years as the guardian of the state\u2019s \u201cFirst-in-the-South\u201d presidential primary. Moore, a Georgia Tech grad, has worked for former Georgia Gov. Sonny Perdue, former South Carolina Gov. Mark Sanford, the Republican Governors Association, the conservative organization Club For Growth, the South Carolina GOP, and most recently, for the state\u2019s newest senator, Tim Scott. The chairman spoke to CNN about the difficulties facing his party, and what it means to be a fresh face in the GOP as the national party struggles to win over a younger generation of voters. CNN: How does the Republican Party attract young voters after President Obama won almost two-thirds of voters under the age of 30? Analysis: Will GOP vote for immigration? Capitol Hill experts sound off Sanford: My affair won't hurt my chances Moore: It\u2019s a multi-step process. We are certainly well aware that Barack Obama won five million more votes among people under 30 than Mitt Romney. Of course, Governor Romney won the over-30 vote by two million people. I think it begins with our message, which is we have to have a positive message that attracts voters. We\u2019ve got to tell voters why they have to be with us instead of against the other guys. The line is that we\u2019ve got to hire Chick-fil-A as our marketing team. Q: What do you mean by that? A: We always joke here that the Republican Party needs Chick-fil-A to do its marketing because we have got to have an inviting message that tells people why they ought to vote for their product instead of against the other guy\u2019s product. Chick-fil-A doesn\u2019t send out fliers that say \u201cMcDonald\u2019s stinks.\u201d They send out a picture of a great-looking chicken sandwich and we eat it. Q: Do conservatives in the party need to downplay their adherence to certain social issues, specifically opposing same-sex marriage, to win back some of those younger folks whose attitudes are fairly different from older generations? A: I think if we allow the Democrats to put wedge issues front and center, we are making a mistake. We have to be out there fighting for people\u2019s hearts and souls on the issues that, at the end of the day, affect their families, affect their pocketbook, affect their small businesses. Republicans have always had success fighting for pocketbook issues. If we allow the Democrats to set the playing field with divisive issues \u2013 well, we shouldn\u2019t do that. Q: What advantage do you think your relative youth gives you over older party leaders? A: I think I bring a fresh way of solving problems. Our generation \u2013 and when I say our generation I mean those probably ages 20 to 40 \u2013 our generation is not as locked into political groups, or social groups, or community groups as they once were. That, for us, presents unique challenges and opportunities in that things can change very quickly. We are kind of like the buffet generation. I might like a little bit of the Republicans\u2019 fiscal conservatism, I might like something about the Democrats, but at the end of the day its up to us to make a winning, positive and compelling message for voters and earn them to get them to our side. We really want to expand the size of the tent in South Carolina. We need to do a better job of reaching young professionals and students. We think the next generation of voters should be conservatives who are tired of the assault on their personal freedoms. Q: Immigration is always a hot-button issue for South Carolina Republicans and Sen. Lindsey Graham is once again knee-deep in the immigration reform push and will have to face questions about it in his re-election campaign next year. Do you think reform will pass? Do you need it to pass for the party to evolve? A: Lindsey Graham is going to be an incredibly hard candidate to beat. He has a lot of money in the bank. He is a tough campaigner. He has a good team. He will be tough to beat. Look, I think we can all agree on the need for reform. I think when you get into the specifics, that\u2019s where the disagreements are in the party and nationally. I certainly think that most people are supportive of some sensible immigration reforms, but it begins and ends at enforcing and securing the border. I don\u2019t think that anyone on our side thinks that the administration is good at doing that. We continue to see broken promises. I don\u2019t see it happening. It\u2019s hard to see how immigration reform happens this year with the polarization of the country. Q: State and national Democrats think they can unseat Gov. Nikki Haley next year in her rematch against state Sen. Vincent Sheheen. Do you see any positive trends on the horizon for South Carolina Democrats that give you pause? A: Democrats were sorely mistaken this spring. They thought they had a great candidate in Elizabeth Colbert-Busch against Mark Sanford. We proved them wrong in doing a few things. One is getting out there and spreading that message of Republicanism, which is limited government, individual freedom and free markets. Democrats had a two-to-one cash advantage and Mark Sanford still won. We had an outstanding ground game. It\u2019s going to very, very hard for Democrats to make any inroads here. I\u2019m not going to say it\u2019s not going to happen, but we have been building the kind of infrastructure here that the RNC and others did not build after 2004 nationally. We can\u2019t make the same mistake the RNC made in 2004 after (George W.) Bush\u2019s re-election, which is they didn\u2019t invest in infrastructure, they didn\u2019t invest in the kind of outreach and relationships necessary to build long term. That\u2019s the goal here in South Carolina. We want to build a majority that last 20, 40, 60, 100 years, even at the county level. Q: What kind of infrastructure are you referring to? A: Last year, we did most of our technology in-house. I directed a good bit of. We had our own list-building systems that were better than the RNC. Look, technology is more than just Facebook and Twitter. Technology is using tools available to augment and add to traditional sort of campaign strategy. If you don\u2019t have a good message, you don\u2019t have a good product and a good candidate, it\u2019s still going to be hard. If we use technology well, we will be successful, but it begins and ends with having good candidates with a positive messages. So we are going to use more Facebook targeting, we are going to use more ad targeting, we did some of that in the Sanford race. We are really getting away form silo-ing that the RNC and others didn\u2019t do well in the mid-2000s, creating a unified system where our finance team is talking to our communications team and our e-mail team. Just really having a unified product. Q: Your party doesn\u2019t exactly have a lot of money in the bank right now. What are your fund-raising plans? A: The party raised $4 million over the past two years. That\u2019s a staggering amount of money to raise. We made significant investments in a lot of races last year. We made a $200,000 investment in the Mark Sanford campaign. We did almost all of the grassroots outreach, TV ads and mail in that race. Obviously it paid off. Parties have a place to save money for rainy days, but I\u2019d argue that a congressional race is a rainy day, we are not in the business of saving money, we are in the business of spending money and winning elections when it matters. Q: In 2012, Newt Gingrich ended the South Carolina primary\u2019s long-held streak of picking Republican nominees. Is the primary still relevant? A: The South Carolina primary is as important as ever. We are the first presidential primary in the South. I am going to fight tooth and nail for it. South Carolina is the first place where you come to appeal to the three-legged stool of the Republican Party, which is the foreign policy, social- and business-minded Republicans. You\u2019ve got to compete across three geographic areas, across a large state. South Carolina\u2019s primary is as important as ever and it will remain that way in 2016, regardless of who comes here to campaign. We have (Kentucky Sen.) Rand Paul coming here soon, and this fall we will be announcing more events with potential candidates. Q: Speaking of Rand Paul, is the GOP becoming more libertarian? A: I don\u2019t know about libertarian. I think society as a whole is more worried about government infringements on their personal liberties, and there has been a big fight over this now in Washington for six or eight weeks. I don\u2019t think the fight is over. The fight is just beginning. We are all on the same page now about limiting the size and scope of government. I think all Americans can all agree on that. Q: How do you plan to work with the liberty movement, those Ron Paul supporters in South Carolina who\u2019ve been been a thorn in the side of the party establishment for years? A: I welcome anyone who believes in those core principles of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. We can disagree from time to time, but I think the Republican Party is the home of those people naturally. The Republican Party is the naturally the home of those people. We are a far cry from the Democrats on those core issues.",

            "article_content": "NEW: Key senators seek new compromise on immigration with time running short House Speaker John Boehner says he won't move bill without majority GOP support Boehner comments put new pressure on Senate to reach deal favorable to conservatives Senate bill would provide path to citizenship, but border security key sticking point A bipartisan group of senators is scrambling to reach a fresh compromise they hope can propel a proposal to overhaul U.S. immigration policy toward passage in that chamber and provide momentum heading into the Republican-controlled House. A deal remained elusive, however, on Tuesday evening and it was uncertain whether the stark differences that have stalled immigration reform for years in Congress could be bridged with time running out on debate. Raising new questions on whether any immigration bill will get through Congress this year, House Speaker John Boehner said earlier in the day that he did not see any way of bringing a bill on that issue to the floor that relied on Democrats to pass. Under enormous pressure from conservatives opposed to the bipartisan Senate bill, Boehner has until now sidestepped questions about how he would move forward. \u201cI don\u2019t see any way of bringing an immigration bill to the floor that doesn\u2019t have majority support of Republicans,\u201d he told reporters following a closed-door GOP conference meeting where a source said he made similar comments to reassure members. Efforts to push forward immigration reform are emotionally charged as the issue has huge political stakes for both sides. President Barack Obama and Democrats want to fulfill a promise to Hispanic Americans, the nation\u2019s fastest-growing demographic, to address the limbo of immigrants living illegally in the country and maintain their overall support. Republican strategists are concerned about the GOP\u2019s long term viability in national elections if it does not win over the important voting bloc, which went strongly for Obama in November. The Senate bill negotiated by a bipartisan group of senators dubbed the \u201cGang of Eight\u201d proposes a path to citizenship for some 11 million undocumented immigrants in the United States. But conservatives consider any measure offering a path to citizenship tantamount to amnesty for those who entered the country illegally. In addition, concerns about whether the bill will tighten security along the nation\u2019s porous borders, as asserted by backers of the plan, may make it difficult for conservatives to support it \u2013 especially those up for re-election next year. Debate began last week and senators have been sorting through amendments. Sen. Marco Rubio, a key player in the Senate debate, senses that significant progress has been made in trying to bridge the gap. \u201cI think we\u2019re on the right track,\u201d the Florida Republican said. During a series of afternoon votes, members of the \u201cGang of Eight\u201d huddled on the floor and separately with other key senators \u2013 twisting arms, cajoling, convincing. In a rare scene, a large group of Republicans anxiously worked the room seeking compromises. The \u201cGang of Eight\u201d and Sen. Bob Corker, a Tennessee Republican, and Sen. John Hoeven, a North Dakota Republican, are attempting to broker a compromise. As of now, it would tighten border security requirements primarily by having Congress dictate exactly how secure the border must be before immigrants in the United States illegally can begin the process of gaining citizenship. By shifting that responsibility to Congress and away from the executive branch, negotiators hope to pick up support from Republican senators who are reluctant to leave that determination to the administration. 5 things to know about immigration reform The emerging deal also would include several other Republican priorities related to entry and exit biometrics, the E-Verify workplace verification program, and rules that would prevent immigrants from getting public benefits. \u201cCorker and I are trying to get enough of these together so you can get a meaningful bipartisan group on the bill,\u201d explained Hoeven, who said he hoped to introduce the proposal as early as Wednesday. A package of amendments is \u201csomething that creates a momentum around the building that people are seeking,\u201d said Corker. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid said time was critical as he threatened to end debate on the bill soon in order to keep a promise to finish the bill by the end of the month. Love or country: Immigration law means hard choices for gay couples 5 things to know about immigration reform A bipartisan group of seven House members \u2013 three Republicans and four Democrats \u2013 is still finalizing its own comprehensive immigration bill that mirrors many of the provisions in the Senate bill, including eventual citizenship for undocumented workers. A CNN/ORC poll released Tuesday shows a small majority of Americans support the approach in the Senate bill. The poll shows that 51% say they support a bill that would attempt to increase border security and create a pathway to citizenship for many undocumented immigrants, with 45% saying they are opposed to such a measure.

            "article_content": "Multiple investigations of the IRS targeting continue Disclosure of U.S. surveillance programs has diminished focus on IRS issue Republicans continue raising the IRS targeting in criticizing the Obama administration The two party leaders on the House Oversight Committee have a public dispute Remember the Internal Revenue Service targeting of conservative groups? IRS targeting: Scandal or snafu? It was the scandal du jour in Washington last month, now relegated to back-burner status after recent revelations of a vast government electronic surveillance apparatus created in the name of national security following the 9/11 terrorist attacks. Holder: Leaks damaged U.S. security The announcement Thursday by the Obama administration that it would boost aid to Syria rebels because government forces there used chemical weapons further shifted attention away from the IRS controversy involving extra scrutiny given conservative groups seeking tax-exempt status. Cummings: Must uncover truth about IRS IRS excerpts raise more questions Issa: IRS orders came from Washington Photos: Key players in the IRS scandal Republicans continue trying to raise the issue, grilling FBI Director Robert Mueller about it at a congressional hearing on Thursday. They argue that the Obama administration used the tax agency to intimidate and harass political opponents. Democrats respond that the independent inspector general who revealed the targeting blamed poor management, rather than political bias. Congressional sources on both sides say that interviews with IRS workers so far have found no political conspiracy. Read IRS watchdog\u2019s report What happens next depends on any further information from ongoing investigations. The IRS,  the agency\u2019s inspector general at the Treasury Department, J. Russell George, the Department of Justice and GOP-led congressional committees are all looking into the matter. Acting IRS Commissioner Danny Werfel, appointed by President Barack Obama to clean up the mess, said last week that he would release more information on the targeting once privacy issues had been worked out. New IRS chief asks for patience over targeting probe If the investigations fail to find a political effort to suppress activities by conservatives, the scandal will likely die a slow bureaucratic death of piecemeal reports in coming months. However, if the multiple inquiries find evidence of guidance from Washington and even the White House, as claimed by Republicans, the scandal would instantly generate new headlines, more hearings and possible criminal proceedings. Rand Paul claims revealing memo exists in IRS scandal Mueller told the House Judiciary Committee on Thursday\u2019s the FBI was investigating IRS targeting, and assured legislators that \u201cto the extent there\u2019s any indication of criminal misconduct, we will follow the leads and the evidence wherever it takes us.\u201d However, he declined to discuss the matter further because of the ongoing probe, prompting frustration from Republicans on the panel. Conservative Rep. Jim Jordan, a fierce critic of the Obama administration, hammered Mueller with questions such as who was leading the investigation, how many investigators were assigned and whether they had interviewed groups victimized by the targeting. When Mueller said he hadn\u2019t been briefed on those details, the Ohio Republican blew up. \u201cYou can\u2019t even tell me who the lead investigator is?\u201d he asked Mueller, who will step down soon after almost 12 years leading the FBI. \u201cYou can\u2019t tell me how many agents are assigned to the most important story in the country?\u201d Seven committee hearings so far on the matter revealed the partisan divide that permeates Washington. Republicans called the targeting a conspiracy of Nixonian dimensions, while Democrats condemned it as bureaucratic rather than political malfeasance. At the House Oversight Committee, GOP Chairman Darrell Issa of California and ranking Democrat Elijah Cummings of Maryland have engaged in a public dispute over interviews that panel investigators conducted with IRS workers involved in the targeting. Earlier this month, Issa released excerpts of transcripts that he said showed IRS officials in Washington played a role in the targeting. \u201cThis was a problem coordinated in all likelihood right out of Washington headquarters and we\u2019re getting to proving it,\u201d he told CNN on June 2. Issa: Cincinnati IRS employees say direction came from Washington \u201cMy gut tells me that too many people knew this wrongdoing was going on before the election, and at least by some sort of convenient, benign neglect, allowed it to go on through the election,\u201d Issa said. \u201cI\u2019m not making any allegations as to motive, that they set out to do it, but certainly people knew it was happening.\u201d In response, the Oversight Committee\u2019s Democratic staff released further interview excerpts that Cummings said disproved any White House role. He challenged Issa to release the full transcript, which has yet to occur. \u201cBased upon everything I\u2019ve seen, the case is solved,\u201d Cummings told CNN last Sunday. \u201cAnd if it were me, I would wrap this case up and move on.\u201d Cummings: \u2018Conservative\u2019 refutes IRS-White House story Meanwhile, the White House has tried to shift attention to other issues with events on student loan rates, health care reform and immigration legislation. Second term mostly drama for Obama GOP resists White House effort to control message Top White House officials say they knew nothing of the targeting when it occurred. General Counsel Kathryn Ruemmler learned of a pending inspector general\u2019s report on April 24, 2013, according to White House spokesman Jay Carney. When asked Wednesday if the full transcripts of interviews with IRS workers should be released, Carney said Issa had promised to do so. He added that Cummings \u201chas demonstrated that we have seen yet again some cherry-picking when it comes to the release of testimony, release of information,\u201d Carney added, referring to past instances when Republicans on the Oversight panel made public details on other issues that turned out to be incomplete or misleading. The inspector general report last month found that an IRS unit in Cincinnati had used criteria that included conservative labels such as \u201ctea party\u201d to target groups seeking tax-exempt status for extra questioning. IRS rules prevent groups engaging in political activity from becoming tax exempt. According to the report, the targeting began in 2010 and ended last year when senior IRS officials learned of it. It blamed a misguided effort to streamline handling of increased applications for tax-exempt status, exacerbated by unclear regulations regarding what constitutes political activity. Republicans contend the targeting was political discrimination in the run-up to the 2012 election, and one of the GOP-led House committees heard from groups who detailed delayed handling of their requests, excessive questioning by the IRS for inappropriate information, and other problems. Some conservatives also contend they faced IRS tax audits due to political targeting, but no evidence of such activity has turned up in investigations so far. George told an earlier congressional hearing that his unit was investigating the possible use of other lists of criteria to trigger additional scrutiny of tax-exempt applications. He provided no details. Meanwhile, the partisan bickering goes on. The Republican National Committee released a video this week that accused the Obama administration of dodging responsibility. It included footage of IRS officials testifying before congressional committees, edited to highlight when they said they didn\u2019t know or were unable to remember details. GOP video keeps up pressure over IRS targeting \u201cAmericans deserve answers to why their First Amendment rights were so egregiously violated,\u201d RNC Chairman Reince Priebus said. \u201cTurning a blind eye and claiming not to know, or remember, what actions were carried out is no excuse for targeting individuals based on their beliefs. These are simple questions, and if they can\u2019t answer it raises another: what are they hiding?\u201d CNN\u2019s Kevin Liptak and Paul Steinhauser contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Potential 2016 presidential candidates already influencing national dialogue While it's too early to mount a campaign, there are steps potential candidates are taking Social conservatives have large say in later primaries but centrist could do well in N.H. Earlier this year, as Frank Guinta was driving his children to school, he turned on a local radio station and heard Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul talking about Guinta\u2019s failed attempt to win re-election to Congress just a few months earlier. Paul was discussing the future of the Republican Party and the need for the GOP to maintain its traditional political base while also welcoming more libertarian-minded conservatives. The Kentucky senator then started citing specific data from the 2012 general election, including Guinta\u2019s race. \u201cYour two Republicans up there lost recently for Congress,\u201d Paul said to New Hampshire political reporter James Pindell in the telephone interview on WGIR. \u201cThey lost by four percentage points, and the libertarian in each race got 4\u00bd percent, so really we do have to figure out a way to attract some of those voters who are voting libertarian if we want to have enough of a majority to win.\u201d Guinta, who served just one term in the House, said he was intrigued to hear Paul talk about his race, let alone in so much detail. \u201cThis was not his political adviser,\u201d the New Hampshire Republican said during a recent interview over breakfast. \u201cIt was him.\u201d But Guinta, who is considering running for office in 2014, said he was not shocked by the moment. After all, this is New Hampshire, which holds the first-in-the-nation primary. And Republicans with designs on the White House are always keeping close tabs on what happens in the Granite State. Christie and Fallon slow jam the news Senator: NSA leak was civil disobediance Christie candid on weight loss, future It would just be a few months later, in May, when Paul would actually visit the state to headline a New Hampshire GOP fundraiser and convene a listening session with local activists.  It was not lost on anyone that Paul dug into his own political pocket and donated $10,000 to the state GOP. Despite smug dismissals of early campaign coverage by press critics, media elites and some of the potential candidates themselves, there are signs everywhere \u2013 including Paul\u2019s intricate recitation of New Hampshire congressional contests \u2013 that the 2016 race for president is starting to take shape, at least among Republicans. Take, for instance: \u2022 This week\u2019s Faith and Freedom Coalition conference, which has been widely described as the first 2016 GOP presidential cattle call. Former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, Texas Gov. Rick Perry, Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, Wisconsin Rep. Paul Ryan, former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum and Paul are all participating. Cruz invited to key early presidential state \u2022 New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie\u2019s willingness to play along with a 2016 joke on Wednesday\u2019s \u201cLate Night with Jimmy Fallon.\u201d \u2022 Paul\u2019s visits already to Iowa and New Hampshire, and upcoming trips to South Carolina and Iowa (again). \u2022 Cruz\u2019s appearance last month at a South Carolina GOP fundraiser and an upcoming visit to Iowa. \u2022 Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal headlining a New Hampshire Republican fundraiser last month. \u2022 Ohio Sen. Rob Portman headlining a fundraiser this week for the New Hampshire Republican Party. \u2022 Rubio\u2019s use of his political action committee to finance a television commercial that defended New Hampshire Sen. Kelly Ayotte against critics of her position on gun rights. \u2022 Santorum\u2019s visit to South Carolina in March to campaign for a Republican candidate in a special congressional election, and his planned visit to Iowa this summer. \u2022 Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker\u2019s appearance at a county Republican fundraiser in Iowa last month. Walker trip fuels 2016 speculation Rick Santorum preparing for 2016 Hillary Clinton's new Twitter page Christie for president in 2016? To dismiss all this political activity would be na\u00efve. Beyond the obvious  \u2013 control of the White House and the direction of the country for four or eight years \u2013 these potential candidates are already exerting influence over the national dialogue and the direction of their political party. \u2022 On immigration: Rubio is the key player at the moment, while Cruz may have an influential role as the legislation is being debated. \u2022 On the surveillance controversy: Paul has become a chief spokesman opposing this collection of information. \u2022 On the state of the GOP: Jindal has admonished fellow Republicans to \u201cstop being the stupid party.\u201d \u2022 On where to find solutions: Perry and Walker emphasizing the need for national Republicans to look to the states for answers. While New Hampshire Republicans acknowledge that it\u2019s too early for candidates to engage in a full-blown campaign, there are steps potential presidential candidates can take now that are being welcomed, if not embraced. \u201cWhat Paul and Jindal are doing is very smart,\u201d Rich Killion, a GOP strategist based in Concord, said of the fundraising for the state party and air cover provided to Ayotte. \u201cThey are trying to do well for others and by doing so are helping themselves. It\u2019s never too early when you come on behalf of others.\u201d But when is too early? It\u2019s fair to say that Mitt Romney never stopped running for president after he lost the GOP nomination in 2008, and Tim Pawlenty was very active early on in building a campaign structure for the 2012 election, only to become the first candidate to drop out of the race in August 2011. What a candidate can\u2019t do is suddenly decide to run for president a year before the primary without having done any spade work and expect strong results. \u201cYou can\u2019t do it in 12 months,\u201d said New Hampshire Republican Party Chair Jennifer Horn, who noted that a campaign needs to begin sooner rather than later. And when the candidates arrive, Horn said, \u201cThe issues that push New Hampshire voters are jobs, the economy, and individual freedoms.\u201d While social conservatives play an influential role in the Iowa and South Carolina primaries, New Hampshire Republicans tend to be more focused on economic issues, which could provide a springboard for more a centrist Republican eyeing the White House \u2013 someone like Christie. \u201cNew Hampshire voters focus on the issues that directly affect them, primarily the economy,\u201d said Alicia Preston, a Republican consultant based in Hampton Beach. \u201cSocial issues tend to be second-tier for most New Hampshire voters and they are willing to accept a social moderate as long as they have a fiscal conservative badge.\u201d Christie passes on conservative gathering for Clinton conference If there is a contested primary-within-a-primary among social conservative candidates who spend their time, money and effort attacking one another in Iowa and South Carolina, that could further add to the already outsized influence New Hampshire has on the process of choosing the GOP nominee. The winner of the New Hampshire primary might not suffer the same political wounds as the candidates who battled for support in the Iowa caucuses and prepared for, perhaps, a last stand in South Carolina. Still, as early GOP maneuvering is on full public display, Democrats are largely in a holding pattern waiting to see if the 800-pound donkey in the room makes a move: former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. It\u2019s Clinton\u2019s for the having \u2013 at least that\u2019s the conventional wisdom at this point \u2013 if she wants the Democratic presidential nomination. Should Clinton decide not to run, then Vice President Joe Biden rolling out the red carpet for Iowa and New Hampshire Democrats during the inauguration and Maryland Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley inviting New Hampshire Democrats down for a St. Patrick\u2019s Day party at the governor\u2019s residence will surely be remembered by those who hold an incredible amount of influence in choosing presidents.",

            "article_content": "Six months after Newtown, gun-control legislation has stalled despite public support Competing political agendas, re-election concerns make it unlikely it will be revisited States have since enacted their own laws in the wake of congressional inaction White House still pushing for new limits in response to school, other mass shootings Six months after a gunman burst into a Newtown, Connecticut, elementary school and slaughtered 20 children and killed six others, promises of stricter national gun control laws remain largely unfulfilled. And though the families of those lost made yet another pilgrimage to Washington this week to plead for action in meetings with the two top House Republicans, it is highly unlikely that lawmakers will act. After the meeting Wednesday, House Speaker John Boehner said the discussions were \u201cvery good.\u201d Boehner declined to say much more about the discussion with the group, but Majority Leader Eric Cantor, who was also at the meeting, told reporters, \u201cI was struck again by the incredible pain that they are going through.  I just can\u2019t imagine as a parent that kind of pain. My heart goes out to them.\u201d Backers of gun control proposals were unable to advance legislation in the Senate centered on expanded background checks earlier this year, even after a high-profile push. The House never took up the measures. Newtown parents fight release of photos Costas: There will be another Newtown Are there too many gun laws already? Obama angry about gun bill failure President Barack Obama lashed out when the Senate effort faltered, calling the defeat a \u201cpretty shameful day for Washington.\u201d The political climate isn\u2019t right. Politically vulnerable moderate Democrats eyeing the 2014 midterm elections don\u2019t want to risk political capital by voting to pass both an immigration overhaul and comprehensive gun control legislation, said CNN senior political analyst David Gergen. New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg\u2019s recent move to discourage funding the four Democratic senators who voted against shoring up background checks on gun sales will largely amount to a \u201csymbolic\u201d gesture, Gergen said. Two of the four \u2013  Sen. Mark Pryor, D-Arkansas, and Sen. Mark Begich, D-Alaska, \u2013 are facing re-election in 2014. Leading Democrats are also dubious about the overall impact of such a move. \u201cThe only way to pass a background check bill is to maintain a Democratic majority in the Senate, and any efforts that make that less likely are counterproductive,\u201d said Adam Jentleson, a spokesman for Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid. \u201cNinety percent of Democrats agree with the 90% of Americans who support background checks, and a Republican majority would guarantee that no background check bill passes in the foreseeable future,\u201d he said. There\u2019s also no incentive for the Republican-controlled House to take up gun control as an issue. That chamber\u2019s leaders have said they won\u2019t bring the matter up until the Senate acts. In either case, it seems as if the nation has moved on. Though national polls taken after the Newtown shooting showed that roughly 90% of Americans supported some form of universal background checks, less than half of those polled were upset by the Senate\u2019s failure to pass that type of measure, according to a Washington Post/Pew Research Center poll. \u201cI\u2019m afraid the moment has probably passed,\u201d Gergen said. After the Newtown shooting, gun control advocates redoubled their efforts with a nation mourning the loss of school children. The issue also galvanized the Obama administration. However, they have thus-far been outmatched by efforts of a powerful gun lobby and a motivated and vocal interest group, the National Rifle Association, said Jon Vernick, co-director of the Johns Hopkins Center for Gun Policy and Research. However, this year\u2019s defeat may could still result in eventual legislative change, Vernick said. In the absence of congressional action on a slate of gun control measures ranging from an assault weapons ban to expanded background checks, many states have taken matters into their own hands. While some states like Connecticut and New York have strengthened laws, others have done the opposite. Undaunted by congressional inaction, the White House is still pushing for tighter laws. Vice President Joe Biden recently shared his confidence that Congress will act with fellow Democrats in an e-mail and chastised Republicans during a recent fundraiser for not supporting expanded background checks for gun sales. Biden is also holding a gun control event at the White House next week. Biden, a former senator, and Reid are also reportedly in talks on how best to resurrect related legislation. \u201cI am not going to bring up a vote just to have a vote,\u201d Reid said last week. \u201cI want to bring up this vote again if we can accomplish something that seems pretty common sense to me. If you have severe mental problems or you are a criminal you shouldn\u2019t be able to buy a gun. That\u2019s what, I agree with 90% of the American people, we should get this done.\u201d CNN\u2019s Deirdre Walsh contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "NEW: GOP Sen. Cruz says the bill as written will pass the Senate but not the House Senate Democrats, Republicans vote overwhelmingly to allow debate President Obama urges Congress to pass the bipartisan Senate measure The would create a 13-year path to citizenship; some conservatives call it amnesty A major immigration bill that would give millions of people living illegally in America a path to citizenship cleared a key legislative hurdle Tuesday when a strong Senate majority voted to open debate on it. The 82-15 vote, with most Republicans joining the chamber\u2019s Democratic majority in support, launched what was expected to be an arduous legislative journey for the 1,076-page measure. Both supporters and opponents expect the bill to pass the Senate despite fierce opposition from conservatives. However, one GOP foe said Tuesday the Republican-controlled House would defeat it in its current form due to the pathway to citizenship. The legislation addresses an emotionally charged issue with huge political stakes for both parties. 'Immigration will make America safer' President Barack Obama and Democrats want to fulfill a promise to Hispanic Americans, the nation\u2019s fastest-growing demographic and a key voting bloc, to address the limbo of the 11 million immigrants living illegally in the country. A few hours before Tuesday\u2019s vote, Obama tried to build momentum for the proposal at a White House event where he called it a commonsense approach to fix a broken system. 5 things to know about immigration reform Addressing concerns of the measure\u2019s opponents, Obama emphasized it would increase spending on border security and require undocumented immigrants to pursue what could be a 13-year path to eventual citizenship. \u201cYou have to pass background checks, you have to learn English, you have to pay taxes and a penalty and then you have to go to the back of the line behind everybody who has done things the right way and have tried to come here legally,\u201d Obama said. Latino voters backed Obama over GOP nominee Mitt Romney by a 44-point margin last year, and Republican strategists are concerned about the party\u2019s long term viability in national elections if that trend holds. In the Senate, Republicans who forced Tuesday\u2019s procedural step that required at least 60 votes to launch debate on the immigration bill joined Democrats to easily surpass that threshold. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid warned that some Republicans had no intention of supporting the measure even though they voted to open the formal debate and will propose amendments during the upcoming debate. Opponents led by GOP Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas accused Democrats of insisting on the pathway to citizenship as part of the bill, knowing House conservatives won\u2019t accept it. The goal of Democrats is to secure a popular campaign issue with Hispanic voters for the 2014 mid-term election and 2016 presidential election, he said. Vermont senator revives debate over gay rights in immigration bill \u201cI think it\u2019s going to pass the U.S. Senate with a substantial margin,\u201d Cruz said. But \u201cabsent major revisions \u2026 this bill will crash and burn in the House. And it is designed to do so.\u201d Polls show many Americans favor some form of immigration policy overhaul, depending on the details of legislation. The bipartisan proposal before Senate was hammered out this spring by the so-called \u201cGang of Eight\u201d senators \u2013 four Democrats and four Republicans. Some congressional conservatives call opposing the \u201cGang of Eight\u201d plan a matter of principle and say they won\u2019t bend. Many consider any measure offering a path to citizenship tantamount to amnesty for those who entered the country illegally. In addition, concerns about whether the bill will tighten security along the nation\u2019s porous borders, as asserted by backers of the plan, may make it difficult for conservatives to support it \u2013 especially those up for re-election next year. \u201cThe bill grants permanent legal status to millions of undocumented immigrants, as currently written, without really any guarantee of securing the border.  Now, how would that possibly be a good idea?\u201d asked Sen. John Cornyn of Texas, the chamber\u2019s No. 2 Republican, who voted Tuesday for opening debate. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Florida, a member of the bipartisan \u201cGang of Eight\u201d who is considered a possible GOP presidential contender in 2016, argued that doing nothing amounts to what he called a \u201cde facto amnesty\u201d for immigrants currently living illegally in America. House working on its own plan At the same time, Rubio \u2013 a popular conservative of Hispanic descent \u2013 has made it clear that border security requirements must be toughened if he and other GOP skeptics will support it. He is pushing an amendment that would make Congress, not the executive branch, responsible for deciding if security metrics at the border have been met before other aspects of the reform bill \u2013 including the pathway to citizenship \u2013 are triggered. Because Rubio\u2019s support is so critical, other members of the bipartisan group have hinted they likely will back his proposal even though they are reluctant to make major changes to their original compromise. The vote on the Rubio amendment will be one of the most closely watched as floor action unfolds over the next three weeks. Other planned amendments will involve stepped-up security checks of people entering the country, temporary visas for high- and low-skilled workers, and other technical provisions. Obama says no one will get everything In a rare display of unity, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, union leaders and other interest groups have come out in support of the Senate plan. Advocates for comprehensive reform won the first major legislative victory last month when the Senate Judiciary Committee voted 13-5 to approve the \u201cGang of Eight\u201d plan. Democratic leaders hope to have a Senate vote on final passage by the end of June. A bipartisan group has been working on a separate immigration plan in the House, but the effort suffered a setback last week when a key member dropped out of the negotiations. Previous efforts to pass immigration reform fell short last decade even though it was said to be a priority of President George W. Bush. Now Obama has made the issue a major priority of his second term. Key senator endorses plan",

            "article_content": "NEW: The ACLU says it filed a lawsuit against NSA domestic surveillance President Obama slammed by controversies, criticism from the right and left The bitter political divide of his first term remains, and may be getting worse History shows that second terms can be tougher for presidents History shows that second terms in the White House can be much tougher than first ones, and that is proving true so far for President Barack Obama. Less than five months in, Obama and his administration appear knocked off balance by a barrage of controversies and criticisms exacerbating the bitter political battles that marked his first four years in office. He\u2019s under fire from the right and left, accused by some of conspiratorial machinations to grab even more power than the leader of the free world legally holds. Headlines are dominated by scandals such as the Internal Revenue Service targeting of conservative groups and classified leaks that disclosed details of the vast data mining and surveillance apparatus created after the 2001 terrorist attacks. Meanwhile, Republicans and some Democrats say his attorney general should resign over various issues including secret subpoenas of journalist phone records. Conservative Democrat: Holder should think about quitting Now, late night comedians are making the controversies a staple of opening monologues, and even the first lady got heckled \u2013 at a Democratic fundraiser, no less. While the issue was gay rights, the incident showed how Obama supporters also were frustrated by what they consider to be a lack of sufficient progress on progressive issues they expect the president to champion. CNN exclusive video: First lady confronts heckler Second-term blues Second-term blues have been the norm for presidents in recent decades, with Ronald Reagan facing the Iran-Contra scandal in the 1980s and Bill Clinton getting impeached over the Monica Lewinskly affair in the 1990s. Political fallout from NSA surveillance Letters describe Guantanamo hunger strike President Obama open to NSA changes To columnist and CNN contributor John Avlon, the latest Washington scandals \u201chave put the president off balance,\u201d with the administration on defense instead of driving the agenda. \u201cThe choice will be in how the administration tries to deal with it,\u201d Avlon said. \u201cIf it\u2019s in denial and acts like these events are occurring outside its purview or control, that will be a big problem.\u201d Obama finds himself mired in topics and disputes far from his second-term agenda, in part because he maintained some of the national security policies of his predecessor that were adopted in a nation traumatized by 9/11, noted CNN Senior Political Analyst Gloria Borger. \u201cThis is a president now who\u2019s dealing with issues he never thought he was going to have to deal with,\u201d Borger said Monday, referring to drone strikes, government surveillance and classified leaks. \u201cBut when you continue some of the policies of George W. Bush, you\u2019re going to have some of the same questions that are raised about them.\u201d How should Obama respond? Avlon and Borger agreed that Obama must be proactive in dealing with the newly revealed details about how the government has access to phone records and Internet activity as tools in fighting terrorism. Last week\u2019s leak of classified documents on the  U.S. intelligence programs forced Obama to try to reassure the nation by declaring \u201cnobody is listening to your telephone calls.\u201d However, the president who campaigned in 2007 by criticizing what he called his predecessor\u2019s claim of a \u201cfalse choice\u201d between civil liberties and national security following the 2001 al Qaeda attacks now argued that such a choice was inevitable. \u201cYou can\u2019t have 100% security and also then have 100% privacy and zero inconvenience,\u201d Obama said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have to make some choices as a society.\u201d 12 moments in national security for Obama\u2019s team Borger said Obama now needs to bolster his administration\u2019s explanation so far \u2013 that Congress and federal judges have sufficient oversight to prevent abuses of the information available. \u201cI think he ought to get out there, speak with the American public, say not only why this kind of surveillance is defensible, but why he thinks it is essential in a post-9/11 world and lay it out there for the American people within the strictures of what he can say given the classified nature of the program,\u201d she said. Fleischer: With the Obama Admin on this President Obama defends NSA surveillance Obama: Nobody is listening to your calls CNN Chief National Correspondent John King noted that despite Obama\u2019s insistence his administration struck a proper balance between national security and domestic surveillance, critics from ranging from libertarian GOP Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky to liberal Democratic Sens. Mark Udall of Colorado and Ron Wyden of Oregon are calling for more details and debate. \u201cIf the president doesn\u2019t try to get ahead of it, guess what, he\u2019ll get dragged along with it,\u201d King said. Other issues on the table On Tuesday, the American Civil Liberties Union said it filed a constitutional challenge to the National Security Agency program that collected information on phone calls, arguing it violated First Amendment rights to free speech and association as well as Fourth Amendment rights to privacy. The controversies come as the administration and Congress wrestle with other volatile issues, including a bipartisan push for immigration reform and a debate over whether to arm Syrian rebels. Avlon and King agreed that Obama needs to move forward on issues where progress can occur, and both cited the Senate immigration bill that would offer a path to legal status for millions of immigrants living illegally in the United States. Conservative Republicans fiercely oppose the measure, but more mainstream GOP legislators consider it vital to the party\u2019s hopes of building support among the nation\u2019s fastest-growing demographic \u2013 the Hispanic vote. In last year\u2019s presidential election, exit polls showed Obama trounced GOP nominee Mitt Romney among Hispanic voters. \u201cThe fact that immigration reform looks possible is significant,\u201d Avlon said, saying passage of a bill would be a \u201csignificant legacy accomplishment\u201d for Obama and also a boost for Congress at a time of extremely low public approval ratings. Republicans led by Sen. Jeff Sessions of Alabama consider the immigration measure drafted by a bipartisan Senate \u201cGang of Eight\u201d little more than amnesty for undocumented immigrants. They demand stricter border enforcement provisions before providing legal status of the estimated 11 million immigrants in the country illegally. Despite such opposition, the Senate voted Tuesday to open debate on the measure, with many Republican foes joining Democrats on the procedural move. However, conservative Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas predicted that while the measure would pass the Senate, it had no chance of winning approval from the GOP-led House unless the pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants was removed. Meanwhile, the Obama administration is looking at possible options this week to increase support to Syrian rebels after resisting persistent calls for months to provide weapons. \u201cThere is a recognition that unless we provide help, a lot of help, the situation is going to be very, very terrible,\u201d one senior administration official said. The official described a \u201csomber mood\u201d among Syria hands throughout the administration, who remain frustrated at inaction by the Obama administration in the face of a deterioration on the ground in Syria and spillover to neighboring states like Lebanon. GOP scrutinizes Justice Department Republicans are quick to seize on any foreign policy objection with the Obama administration as an opening to attack former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who is considered the leading possible Democratic presidential contender in 2016. In the House, the Oversight and Government Reform Committee has demanded more information on erroneous talking points by the administration four days after the terrorist attack last September on a diplomatic outpost in Benghazi, Libya, that killed four Americans, including Ambassador Christopher Stevens. Rep. Darrell Issa of California, the panel\u2019s GOP chairman, also is a leading critic of Attorney General Eric Holder over the botched \u201cFast and Furious\u201d gun walking program and other issues. Holder now faces further scrutiny over the Justice Department\u2019s secret subpoenas of phone records for Associated Press journalists last year as part of an investigation of a classified leak. He has told legislators he recused himself from that case and never would prosecute a journalist for doing investigative reporting. Republicans question if Holder lied to Congress when he told a congressional hearing last month that he had no knowledge of any possible prosecution of journalists linked to classified leaks. Avlon said the various issues provide grist for Obama critics now, but the major factor in determining public opinion on a presidency will be the economy, which is moving in the right direction for the White House. \u201cTeflon presidents are Teflon in part because of the economy,\u201d he said, rejecting accusations by some conservatives that Obama\u2019s troubles amount to scandals that could lead to impeachment. \u201cThe impulse to simply throw out Nixon narratives as a poster boy for the second-term curse is silly,\u201d Avlon added. \u201cThis ain\u2019t Watergate and calls for impeachment reflect hyperpartisan wishes rather than reality.\u201d Maybe not impeachment, but certainly fodder for television comedians. For example, David Letterman joked that for his daughter Sasha\u2019s birthday, Obama gave her Justin Bieber\u2019s phone records.

            "article_content": "Conservatives oppose any plan with path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants Boehner could be straddling divide if Senate passes bipartisan immigration bill House Conservatives see no pressure to pass bill because of they represent solidly red districts Boehner's future threatened if he allows vote on bill that conservatives will reject As the Senate this week casts its first round of votes on immigration reform, a divided Republican conference on the other side of the Capitol may be a roadblock to any immigration measure passing Congress this year. And that internal split will soon pose a critical test for House Speaker John Boehner. One side of the divide was clear during a closed meeting last week among House and Senate conservatives \u2013 the first time they\u2019ve sat down to talk about a comprehensive immigration reform plan that includes  a path to citizenship for undocumented workers. Immigration reform clears key Senate hurdle Two of the Senate\u2019s GOP \u201cGang of Eight\u201d members \u2013 Marco Rubio of Florida and Jeff Flake of Arizona, who are pushing the Senate\u2019s bipartisan plan \u2013 faced off with well over 100 Republican members of the conservative Republican Study Committee (RSC). Rubio is considered key to bringing conservatives on board, and Flake used to be a member of the RSC. Navarrette: Rubio\u2019s wild immigration ride The meeting only seemed to harden conservative opposition. Rubio distances self from immigration plan he helped draft Alabama GOP Rep. Mo Brooks summed up the reaction of many House GOP members who attended the session, telling CNN those senators explaining the merits of that plan \u201cwere doing their best to put lipstick on a pig.\u201d Georgia Rep. Tom Price, a leading conservative, told reporters it was \u201chighly unlikely\u201d the majority of House Republicans would vote for a bill similar to the Senate deal that permits citizenship after a series of conditions are met because he and GOP colleagues don\u2019t trust the Obama administration to enforce the laws currently on the books. Ayotte backs Gang of Eight immigration plan Bipartisan House plan on the rocks While many House conservatives agree immigration reform is a critical priority for Congress, they part with President Barack Obama, Senate Democrats, and some in their own party who believe allowing eventual citizenship to those in the country illegally is part of the solution. They vow that they won\u2019t support any bill that adds to the deficit and they want to see a tougher approach to border security. 5 things you should know about immigration reform Mental health and guns How will Congress vote on immigration? Warren Buffett on stimulus, immigration But there is a bloc of House GOP members \u2013 including 2012 vice presidential candidate Rep Paul Ryan of Wisconsin \u2013 that is pushing for a similar bipartisan approach that the Senate is taking up this week, which includes a path to citizenship. The group represents a minority within the House GOP conference. That bipartisan effort suffered a significant setback last week. A working group, similar to the Senate\u2019s \u201cGang of Eight,\u201d has been on the verge of unveiling legislation for months, according to multiple sources. But  Rep. Raul Labrador, one of the four GOP members in the group, abruptly dropped out.  Like Rubio, who is needed to attract Republican votes in the Senate, reform backers hoped Labrador would play the same role in the House. Labrador was frustrated he couldn\u2019t get support for his detailed proposal laying out how undocumented workers in the U.S. would be barred from any taxpayer-funded health care benefits. Labrador leaves House bipartisan immigration group Labrador told CNN his decision to leave the group and Rubio\u2019s call to add tougher border security measures to the Senate bill \u201cmeans maybe what we\u2019ll get is real immigration reform with conservative ideals that most Americans want.\u201d Bipartisan House immigration talks foundering Florida Rep Mario Diaz-Balart, who is still part of the group and has been involved in immigration negotiations for more four years, tried to downplay Labrador\u2019s exit, praising him and saying \u201cthis has always been a very difficult issue,\u201d and said he remained committed to pushing ahead. Boehner repeatedly stresses that he supports the work of the House bipartisan group, but he won\u2019t weigh in on any policy details.  He has vowed any legislation would follow \u201cregular order,\u201d meaning any bill will go through committees. \u2018A special path to citizenship is very problematic\u2019 After backlash from many of his rank and file members for cutting \u201cbackroom deals\u201d on the debt ceiling and other issues, the Speaker wants time to educate his members on immigration reform and gain some buy-in for any bill or set of bills. That approach means House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte of Virginia will wield significant power in the coming weeks. Goodlatte disagrees with the Senate Democrats\u2019 strategy to move one comprehensive bill, saying he prefers to move a series of discrete immigration measures through his committee. Goodlatte has focused his attention on the border security and employer verification aspects of reform and told reporters he has major concerns with moving legislation that sets up a process eventually allowing those already in the U.S. illegally to become citizens. \u201cA special path to citizenship is very problematic\u201d Goodlatte said. Obama: No one will get everything in immigration reform Given the internal divisions Boehner has been careful not to signal whether he will move immigration in one package or allow votes on separate bills.  But the Speaker appears to be prodding his members to get moving.  He told reporters at his weekly news conference last week he expected the Judiciary panel to have \u201csome vehicles\u201d to move by the end of the month. Reform advocates worry that if the House breaks up any comprehensive bill and moves it in pieces it could kill momentum for immigration this year, but the process is important so that Boehner can say the House has input and Democrats are open to different options. When immigration efforts shift to the House it\u2019s notable that the political dynamic is much different that it is in the Senate. After Latinos went overwhelmingly for Obama in the 2012 election, many Republicans conceded the party needed to soften its stance and back legalization for undocumented workers this year to attract more Latino support. Many Senate Republicans feel pressure in states with high Hispanic populations to reverse their previous opposition to comprehensive immigration reform, or else suffer major losses among minority voters. But House districts have become more solidly red and blue after redistricting so there is less concern among most House Republicans that opposing immigration reform would hurt their chances at re-election. If the Senate passes legislation with a significant bipartisan vote there will be intense pressure on Boehner to act. He and other top House GOP leaders recognize passing major immigration legislation helps their party\u2019s long-term electoral prospects and could be a major issue in recapturing the White House in 2016. But the Speaker risks antagonizing many of his members by proceeding with a bill that would ultimately need a majority of Democratic votes to pass. How Boehner decides to proceed with immigration in the House could affect his political fortunes. Brooks gave a warning to Boehner as he considers the next step, telling CNN, \u201cIf the Speaker allows a vote on any immigration bill that results in the passage despite a majority of the Republican conference voting against it, then it will be interesting to see if he can muster the votes to get re-elected after the next election.\u201d",

Among other things, the measure aims to strengthen border security while raising the cap on visas for high-skilled workers and establishing a new visa program for low-skilled workers on America\u2019s farms and elsewhere. \u201cThis week, the Senate will consider a commonsense, bipartisan bill that is the best chance we\u2019ve had in years to fix our broken immigration system,\u201d President Barack Obama said Tuesday. \u201cIf you genuinely believe we need to fix our broken immigration system, there\u2019s no good reason to stand in the way of this bill.\u201d Needless to say, a lot of folks on Capitol Hill disagree with the president. \u201cThis bill has serious flaws,\u201d warned Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky.  \u201cThere will need to be major changes to this bill if it\u2019s going to become law.\u201d Here are five key things to know about the state of play on this controversial issue: 1) The \u2018Gang of Eight\u2019 remains unified Eight men put the bipartisan Senate bill together \u2013 South Carolina Republican Lindsey Graham, Arizona Republican Jeff Flake, Florida Republican Marco Rubio, Arizona Republican John McCain, New Jersey Democrat Robert Menendez, Illinois Democrat Dick Durbin, Colorado Democrat Michael Bennet, and New York Democrat Chuck Schumer.  Each of the eight has promised to oppose any major changes to the bill. During Senate Judiciary Committee\u2019s consideration of roughly 300 proposed amendments, Flake and Graham repeatedly sided with the panel\u2019s Democrats in opposing significant changes offered by their fellow conservatives.  Schumer and Durbin voted against some amendments proposed by more liberal members, even though the pair said they supported the ideas. Rubio was disappointed that the committee rejected an amendment requiring the use of biometrics \u2013 such as fingerprints \u2013 for visa holders at all of the country\u2019s entry and exit points.  But he hasn\u2019t dropped his support for the overall bill. \u201cEverybody needs to know it \u2013 who\u2019s calling the shots,\u201d conservative Alabama GOP Sen. Jeff Sessions said at one of the committee\u2019s meetings on the bill.  The answer, at least so far, remains the \u201cGang of Eight.\u201d 2) Reform advocates have momentum, but there\u2019s a long way to go Advocates for comprehensive immigration reform won their first major legislative victory last month when the Judiciary Committee voted 13-5 to approve the \u201cGang of Eight\u201d plan. The committee\u2019s tally was significant in part because three Republicans \u2013 Flake, Graham, and Utah\u2019s Orrin Hatch \u2013 joined the panel\u2019s Democrats in backing the measure. Assuming every member of the Democratic caucus backs the bill on the Senate floor, five Republicans will be needed to ensure it receives the 60 votes needed to pass the 100-member chamber. he bill\u2019s backers have been hoping for as many as 70 votes, in order to give the proposal significant bipartisan momentum heading into the tougher GOP-controlled House. The Senate voted 82-15 to open debate, an important tally but in no way a predictor of how the issue will play out. Make no mistake \u2013 serious momentum will be needed in the House, where conservatives remain deeply skeptical about border security and any path to citizenship for those who entered the country illegally. A lot of conservatives consider the current proposed path to be a form of amnesty, which may as well be a four-letter word in this debate. Any measure that passes the House will almost certainly have to be reconciled with the Senate plan in a conference committee. And assuming that can be done, both chambers would then have to pass the compromise legislation. 3) It\u2019s not clear anything can pass the House A bipartisan working group in the House \u2013 similar to the Senate\u2019s \u201cGang of Eight\u201d \u2013 has been on the verge of unveiling legislation for months, according to multiple sources.  But it hasn\u2019t been able to seal the deal, and one of the Republicans in the group recently dropped out. Idaho Rep. Raul Labrador said he was frustrated he couldn\u2019t get support for a provision ensuring undocumented workers are barred from any taxpayer-funded health care benefits. For his part, Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, has repeatedly said he supports the work of the House bipartisan group. He won\u2019t, however, weigh in on any policy details. A number of congressional observers believe that after experiencing a backlash from many of his rank and file members for cutting \u201cbackroom deals\u201d on other issues, Boehner wants time to educate his caucus on immigration reform and gain some buy-in for any bill or set of bills. Boehner could antagonize many of his members if he decides to move forward with a bill requiring a majority of Democratic votes to pass. \u201cIf the speaker allows a vote on any immigration bill that results in the passage despite a majority of the Republican conference voting against it, then it will be interesting to see if he can muster the votes to get re-elected after the next election,\u201d Alabama GOP Rep. Mo Brooks recently told CNN. 4) Immigration is Obama\u2019s best shot for big second-term legislative win Why?  Democrats are basically unified on the issue, while Republicans are divided.  On Sunday, New Hampshire\u2019s Kelly Ayotte became the first GOP senator outside of the \u201cGang of Eight\u201d to publicly endorse the group\u2019s plan. \u201cThis is a thoughtful, bipartisan solution to a tough problem,\u201d she said on CBS\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation.\u201d Nothing focuses a politician\u2019s attention like an election loss, and Republicans were thumped last year by the country\u2019s growing Hispanic population. Latinos backed Obama over Mitt Romney by a 44-point margin. GOP strategists are concerned about the party\u2019s long term viability in national elections if that trend is not reversed. Some congressional conservatives have already said opposing the \u201cGang of Eight\u2019s\u201d plan is a matter of principle and they won\u2019t bend. But others might. This is a rare moment when the two political parties\u2019 priorities may overlap enough to make Capitol Hill a productive place. 5) Polls \u2013 what does the public think? Most national polling conducted over the past few months indicate majority support for an eventual pathway to citizenship, as long as undocumented workers clear a series of hurdles such as paying back taxes and fines.  Support for a pathway ranges from nearly 60% to almost 80% of Americans, depending on the poll. CNN Poll: Most see pathway to citizenship 65% of Americans back a pathway to citizenship as long as it requires payment of back taxes and fines, according to a May 30-June 2 NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll.  77% of Democrats support a pathway under such circumstances, compared to 58% of Republicans and 54% of independents. People are skeptical, however, about the ability of Congress to get the job done, according to a May 22-28 Quinnipiac University survey.  Only 24% of the Quinnipiac poll\u2019s respondents believe congressional Democrats and Republicans can work together to pass a comprehensive immigration reform bill. 71% of Americans don\u2019t expect enough bipartisan cooperation to pass such legislation, according to the survey.

            "article_content": "Senate Judiciary Committee passes \"Gang of Eight\" immigration reform bill Measure passes panel in a 13-5 vote, advances to full Senate NEW: President Obama urges Senate to swiftly consider the measure Panel does not approve a pair of gay rights amendments The Senate Judiciary Committee approved the bipartisan \u201cGang of Eight\u201d immigration reform bill on Tuesday, sending the measure to the Senate floor for consideration and giving the bill\u2019s backers their first major legislative victory. Members of the Democratic-controlled panel voted 13-5 in favor of the measure. If enacted, the plan would constitute the first overhaul of the nation\u2019s immigration policy since 1986. \u201cThe dysfunction in our current immigration system affects all of us and it is long past time for reform. I hope that our history, our values, and our decency can inspire us finally to take action,\u201d Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy, D-Vermont, said. Spectators cramming the committee room applauded and cheered loudly following the vote. The panel\u2019s 10 Democrats were joined in supporting the bill by three Republicans: Arizona\u2019s Jeff Flake, South Carolina\u2019s Lindsey Graham, and Utah\u2019s Orrin Hatch. Flake and Graham are two of its four Republican authors. Opinion: \u2018Rogue\u2019 DHS unions follow Obama\u2019s lead on deportation Both party leaders in the Senate appeared supportive of the effort, a positive sign for backers hoping to win a solid majority in the full chamber. \u201cI think the \u2018Gang of Eight\u2019 has made a substantial contribution to moving the issue forward,\u201d said Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky.  \u201cI\u2019m hopeful we\u2019ll be able to get a bill that we can pass here in the Senate.\u201d Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, praised the \u201cmasterful\u201d job of Leahy in navigating roughly 300 proposed amendments and advancing the 844-page bill to the floor. Immigration reform is a priority for both parties in Washington and so far is one example of bipartisanship this year on major legislation in a sharply divided Congress. A key political aim involves Republicans hoping to attract more Hispanics to their side, while Democrats wishing to keep that growing voter bloc squarely in their camp. Latinos voted overwhelmingly for President Barack Obama\u2019s re-election. He congratulated the committee on its work and urged the Senate to bring the bill to the floor at its earliest possible opportunity. \u201cThe legislation that passed the Judiciary Committee with a strong bipartisan vote is largely consistent with the principles of commonsense reform I have proposed and meets the challenge of fixing our broken immigration system,\u201d he said in a statement. \u201cNone of the Committee members got everything they wanted, and neither did I, but in the end, we all owe it to the American people to get the best possible result over the finish line.\u201d The measure approved by the Judiciary panel would create a 13-year path to citizenship for most of the country\u2019s 11 million undocumented immigrants. Bipartisan House immigration talks foundering, Republican warns It aims to strengthen border security while raising the cap on visas for high skilled workers and establishing a new visa program for low skilled workers on America\u2019s farms and elsewhere. Proponents say the change is necessary to permanently and fairly resolve the status of  undocumented residents. Critics insist the proposed change amounts to amnesty, rewarding those who chose to break the country\u2019s immigration laws. Sen. Jeff Sessions, R-Alabama, is leading the charge against the \u201cGang of Eight\u201d proposal and is a tough critic. He has tried to derail the bill at nearly every turn, arguing that adding millions of newly legalized workers to the mix over the next few years will only hurt the most vulnerable segments of the American work force. He also has raised security and other concerns. \u201cThis will be a hammer blow to the wages and employment opportunities of American workers\u2014both immigrant and native born,\u201d Sessions said in a statement after the vote. \u201cThis bill is bad for workers, bad for taxpayers and\u2014as immigration officers have pleaded for us to hear\u2014a threat to public safety and the rule of law,\u201d he said. In a defeat for backers of expanded gay rights, the committee did not approve a pair of Leahy-sponsored amendments bolstering federal support for bi-national same-sex relationships. Specifically, Leahy had proposed recognizing same-sex marriages in which one spouse is an American, and allowing U.S. citizens to sponsor foreign-born same-sex partners for green cards given proof of a committed relationship. Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, the most prominent Republican in the \u201cGang of Eight,\u201d was among those who called Leahy\u2019s amendments a poison pill virtually certain to destroy GOP support for the measure. Immigration bill is Democratic plot, House conservative says Leahy\u2019s amendments could be considered again when the bill is taken up by the full Senate. Doing so, however, would be little more than a symbolic gesture, as the proposals have virtually no chance of winning the 60 votes almost certainly needed to clear the 100-member chamber. Earlier this month, Sen. Richard Durbin, D-Illinois, noted the possibility that an upcoming ruling by the U.S. Supreme Court on the federal Defense of Marriage Act could render the whole issue moot. \u201cThe DOMA ruling could change this whole debate,\u201d Durbin said. \u201cThey could eliminate DOMA and impose obligations on our federal government (relating to) same gender marriage, and that would dramatically change what we\u2019re trying to achieve.\u201d The House is working on its own version of immigration reform.",

            "article_content": "History shows second term presidents can make progress despite problems Republicans are intent on focusing attention on administration controversies The White House accuses the GOP of playing politics on some issues One potential scandal involves the secret subpoena of journalists' phone records Secretly accessing phone records of journalists. IRS targeting of conservative groups. Misleading statements last year about the Benghazi terrorist attack. News headlines of the past week portray an administration engulfed in potential scandal, providing opponents of President Barack Obama with plenty of ammunition to try to derail his agenda in the early months of his second term. The scenario invites comparisons to previous presidents who faced controversies in their \u201clame duck\u201d second terms, such as the Iran-Contra scandal of the Reagan administration and Bill Clinton\u2019s impeachment for perjury and obstruction of justice in the Monica Lewinsky scandal. However, a rocky start to a second term doesn\u2019t mean certain derailment of a president\u2019s goals or agenda. For example, Reagan and Clinton both signed major fiscal legislation during their lame duck terms, noted Howard Kurtz, the host of CNN\u2019s \u201cReliable Sources.\u201d Despite increasingly strident rhetoric from Republican leaders and others, White House spokesman Jay Carney insisted Tuesday the controversies have little connection to Obama\u2019s second-term agenda. FBI to investigate IRS conduct GOP leaders compare Obama to Nixon \u201cThe president is focused on what he believes the American people expect from him and from their leaders in Washington,\u201d he told reporters, citing campaign issues from his re-election last November such as economic growth, expanded opportunities for the middle class and immigration reform. In question is whether Republicans intent on focusing attention on potential scandal will be willing to work with Obama and Democrats on such major legislation. Already, the president has seen stiff GOP opposition derail gun legislation he proposed in the aftermath of the Connecticut school massacre. Full details of the controversies remain unknown, but the issues are certain to continue to dominate Washington in coming days. Carney spoke as Attorney General Eric Holder announced a Justice Department investigation of whether any laws were broken in the IRS political targeting. Congress also is looking into the matter, with a House committee hearing scheduled for Friday. The embattled Holder, cited for contempt of Congress by House Republicans during Obama\u2019s first term over the botched \u201cFast and Furious\u201d gun walking program, also confirmed that he recused himself last year from his department\u2019s investigation of classified leaks that led to the recent secret subpoenas of telephone logs of The Associated Press. According to the AP, U.S. officials have said they were probing how details were leaked in May 2012 about a foiled bomb plot that targeted a U.S.-bound aircraft, and that the Justice Department collected two months of telephone records for some AP reporters and editors without notifying the news organization. The Republican National Committee called for Obama to demand Holder\u2019s resignation over the matter. If not, said RNC Chairman Reince Priebus, it will show that \u201cthe president of the United States believes his administration is above the Constitution and does not respect the role of a free press.\u201d Even Democrats such as Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada condemned the secret subpoena of AP phone records. \u201cI don\u2019t know who did it, or why it was done, but it\u2019s inexcusable, and there\u2019s no way to justify this,\u201d Reid told reporters. Meanwhile, Republican senators characterized the IRS political targeting as a broad abuse of power by the administration. \u201cI have never seen anything quite like this except in the past during the Nixon years,\u201d veteran Sen. Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, told reporters in an allusion to the Watergate scandal that led to President Richard Nixon\u2019s impeachment and resignation. Carney rejected such GOP statements as political hyperbole, but also sought to distance the administration from the roiling issues. \u201cI understand the natural inclination to try to bunch some of these things together, but there really is a distinction here,\u201d he said. He refused to discuss specific details of the Justice Department\u2019s subpoena of AP telephone records, citing the ongoing criminal investigation of the classified leak. At the same time, he described Obama as desiring a balance between protecting classified information vital to national security and the First Amendment right of a free and unfettered press. Carney also avoided specific comment on IRS political targeting, saying it would be inappropriate until the upcoming release of an inspector general\u2019s report on the matter. He noted Obama\u2019s remarks to reporters on Monday that if the reported allegations of political targeting proved true, they would be \u201coutrageous\u201d and require immediate action against those responsible. However, Carney criticized the continuing GOP focus on the administration\u2019s response in the immediate aftermath of the Benghazi attack last September  11 as a \u201csideshow that\u2019s driven purely by or largely by political interests.\u201d The Benghazi issue has renewed GOP criticism of former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, considered the certain Democratic frontrunner if she decides to run for president in 2016. In particular, Republicans accuse the administration of not bolstering security prior to the attack, of botching the response to it, and of misleading the public in its slow-to-evolve explanation of events less than two months before the November election. After the GOP-led House Oversight Committee held a hearing last week on the attack that killed the U.S. ambassador to Libya and three other Americans, Republican politicians and organizations launched a campaign that sought to raise questions about Clinton\u2019s role as the nation\u2019s top diplomat at the time. An independent review of the Benghazi incident, led by Former Joint Chiefs Chairman Adm. Mike Mullen and former ambassador Thomas Pickering, found no wrongdoing by Clinton. CNN\u2019s Chief National Correspondent John King noted that history shows popular politicians can overcome links to scandal. In 1988, Democrats tried to use the Iran-Contra scandal of the Reagan administration, which involved weapons sales to Iran that funded anti-communist rebels in Nicaragua, against then-Vice President George H.W. Bush, he said. The scandal involved an attempted cover-up, televised congressional hearings, criminal charges and resignations, but in the end, Bush won the presidential vote.

Bush's life, legacy Photos: The George W. Bush Presidential Center Photos: The presidents club On the trail with George W. Bush In conjunction with Thursday\u2019s dedication of the George W. Bush Presidential Center in Dallas, CNN circled back with several key players in the big debates and moments of the 43rd president\u2019s two terms. Here are some of their reflections and recollections: KAREN HUGHES, longtime Bush communications adviser dating back to his days as Texas governor, who served in the Bush White House and later the State Department: On the morning of September 11, 2001: \u201cBut I turned on the television, was talking with my deputy, who was with the president in Florida. Saw the second plane hit the second tower. And I remember hearing the sound of a yardman blowing leaves outside. There was a leaf-blower, somebody working in the garden. And thinking, \u2018How could something sound so normal, because nothing\u2019s ever going to be normal again?\u2019 And so, I remember at that moment having it hit me. The other moment was the first time I saw the president that day. And I was, by then, at the White House in the emergency bunker. And the president convened a meeting of the National Security Council via teleconference. And the moment I saw him, he practically came through the screen and he said, \u2018We are at war against terror. And from this day forward, this is the priority of our administration.\u2019\u201d On being uncertain for a stretch about whether there had been an attack on Air Force One as the president headed back to Washington from Florida and she wanted permission to brief the news media: \u201cBecause no one knew exactly what was happening. And so, I was trying to find the president because I knew he would want me to go out and brief, if I could talk to him. And when the operator said, \u2018You know, Ma\u2019am, we\u2013 we can\u2019t reach Air Force One\u2013\u2019 you know, my immediate thought was\u2013 \u201cOh, you know, surely something hasn\u2019t happened to them?\u201d Because I\u2019d never had that happen before where they literally couldn\u2019t reach him. So that was an awful moment.\u201d 9/11 marks turning point at Bush Library Gillespie: US safer today thanks to Bush Dignitaries mark Bush Library dedication On Iraq and the failure to match pre-war predictions: \u201cI think there\u2019s a feeling that things were a lot worse, that the country was in a lot worse situation than we were probably prepared for or understood. And I, you know, I think in talking with, again, the people who were on the national security team who were closest to it, they will admit that, you know, there were mistakes made and things didn\u2019t go as well as we had hoped or planned for.\u201d On the government\u2019s response to Katrina, and its impact on the second Bush term: \u201cI was just at the beginning of my tenure as under secretary for public diplomacy. And people around the world, they didn\u2019t believe the United States of America, our powerful country, couldn\u2019t do anything. Therefore, they felt we were choosing not to do anything. And I think that\u2019s the most unfortunate perception; that somehow the government was choosing not to help its own people. And of course, that\u2019s not true. I think they felt their hands were tied. But that\u2019s the unfortunate perception that developed.\u201d \u201cI think it was a huge shadow over the rest of his presidency, unfortunately. \u2026Clearly that first year (of the second term) is really critically important. And the failure of social security reform, immigration reform, that situation with Katrina, I think it really did cast a big shadow over the rest of the presidency.\u201d 5 presidents on hand for Bush Center dedication HANK PAULSON, former treasury secretary: On the 2008 financial crisis: \u201cI would tell you probably the darkest moment I had was after we had done everything. And at least I thought had done everything. It turns out we weren\u2019t done yet, after we\u2019d put the capital in the banks, with the TARP program, and after the election, when Citi started to come unglued. And we put in place a rescue package. We weren\u2019t sure whether it was gonna work. I was feeling quite down, stressed, and the president came over and spent some time. He asked me what I was worried about. And I said, obviously I was worried that there would be a collapse. And he said, you know, \u2018I\u2019ve got great confidence in the steps we\u2019re taking. \u2026 Just be glad this isn\u2019t happening at the beginning of a new administration when a president is focused to a much greater extent on the polls and is trying to figure out how to work with a new treasury secretary.\u2019\u201d On Bush brushing aside objections from fellow Republicans he was interfering too much in the economy: \u201cWe did some things that must have been \u2013 they were unpleasant for me. Very, very necessary, but unpleasant. And for him, believing as he does in free markets\u2013 and knowing how unpopular they were gonna be with his base. But he knew and he and I talked about the fact if we didn\u2019t do it, there wouldn\u2019t be any, much left of the free market. And so he kept saying, \u2018Don\u2019t worry. We\u2019re gonna do what it takes to save the economy.\u2019\u201d Bush: I was reminded that evil exists George W. Bush: Pet portrait painter FRAN TOWNSEND, former homeland security adviser: On initial troop levels in Iraq: \u201cI think the surge, suggest that was a mistake. \u2026 I was not there as those decisions were getting made in the run-up. But I think the surge itself and the success that the surge had is the critical indicator that the decision to go in lean was not the most effective, was not the best. And frankly, as a result, we dealt \u2013 we were dealing with the civil strife.\u201d MICHAEL CHERTOFF, former homeland security secretary: On the decision to fire FEMA Director Michael Brown during the Katrina response: \u201cI actually came to that conclusion a couple of days into the event and it was precipitated by the fact that when I was asking him, \u2018Do we have a plan to get the buses, and do we have a better plan for evacuating people?\u2019 I either had difficulty getting an answer or I had difficulty getting in touch with him. And it became clear to me that whatever he had done previously, on the ground, operational management of this event was not his strong suit, and I wanted to get somebody who was an operator, and that turned out to be Thad Allen, in place. And the president told me, you know from the outset, \u2018This is up to you. You make the decision and I will support you.\u2019 And he did support me in relieving Brown.\u201d On the constant crises of the Bush presidency: \u201cYou know the president used to say sometimes, even in the midst of a lot of stress and anxiety that, \u2018we\u2019re privileged to be able to serve at a time when we\u2019re really called upon to face amazing challenges.\u2019 \u2026 If you look at 9/11, which was an unprecedented event, Katrina, which while not quite as unprecedented, created some novel challenges and then the financial crisis, which again, although not the first time we had one, certainly was the first in a really long time. It was a very tough eight years. I don\u2019t think the president would\u2019ve traded that for an uneventful eight years.\u201d BARNEY FRANK, former Democratic congressman from Massachusetts: On refusing to raise taxes or consider any new revenues to pay for wars in Afghanistan and Iraq: \u201cIt could be five years, 25 years, 125 years. He will be guilty of absolute financial irresponsibility. The notion of financing two wars with five tax cuts is just crazy. And that\u2019s what he did. And if you go back in history we almost always raise taxes to fight a war.\u201d DOUG WEAD, a former aide and adviser to Presidents George H.W. Bush and later George W. Bush, who fell out of favor with the Bush family because of his take on the second Bush presidency: \u201cHe loves his dad. He admires his dad. He\u2019s challenged by his dad. His dad\u2019s his point of reference. He measures himself by his dad. \u2018My vice president compared to dad\u2019s vice president. My war compared to dad\u2019s war.\u2019 There\u2019s airplanes, airplanes. There\u2019s baseball, baseball. There\u2019s Andover, Andover. There\u2019s Yale, Yale.\u201d On his belief George W. Bush took office determined to remove Saddam Hussein from power: \u201cBecause of the attempt of the assassination of his father. He loves his dad. And he attempted to kill his father and it was commissioned by the government and Saddam Hussein, and they had 12 people assigned to it and it was quite an elaborate plan to assassinate his father and they felt hopeless \u2013 and I think angry that the Clinton administration didn\u2019t do more. They fired off some tomahawk cruise missiles in retaliation but the Iraqis knew they were coming. I think they resented that.\u201d CNN Poll: Bush\u2019s standing improves four years later MARY MATALIN, senior adviser to President Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney: On assertions by Wead and others that the administration was hell-bent on war with Iraq: \u201cTo those idiots, I say \u2018Get a life.\u2019 Cause you have to be an idiot to think that any commander-in-chief, any public servant with the record of either of those accomplished men who come from the families that they did would use our nation\u2019s security as an opportunity.\u201d On the Bush-Cheney relationship and critics the vice president had too much power: \u201cThe president wanted Dick Cheney to be powerful. And that Dick Cheney\u2019s operating principle, in turn, was, \u2018The president makes the decisions. It\u2019s my job to give him the best information, my best advice. He makes the decisions, and I salute smartly and move on.\u2019 So there was never any puppet master business there. And I don\u2019t \u2013 and from what I do know of them both. We, they, more joked about it than anything else. It just wasn\u2019t a factor for them. These are two mature, accomplished competent men who were in a crisis environment.\u201d On second-term strains in the Bush-Cheney relationship: \u201cWhen they say tension, they don\u2019t mean like a girl cat fight or mean girls. There was a big disagreement and there was a lot of emotion in the Scooter Libby lack of pardon. Because from the Scooter Libby camp perspective, he was promoting the president\u2019s policies, protecting the president\u2019s policies.\u201d Bush 43: \u2018History will ultimately judge\u2019 JOHN MCLAUGHLIN, former deputy director and later director of the CIA On how fast the CIA went from speculating al Qaeda was responsible to knowing al Qaeda was responsible for 9/11: \u201cI would say an hour or two after the attacks an analyst ran into our little emergency headquarters there and said, \u2018Okay, I know this is al Qaeda for sure\u2019 because this analyst had obtained, somehow, one of the manifests from the planes, from one of the airlines, and recognized at least two names among the passenger crew as al Qaeda people that we were searching for, and that we believed to be in the United States.\u201d On how quickly some in the administration turned to Iraq after the 9/11 attacks: \u201cIraq entered the conversation very early\u2013 as early as September 15 at Camp David. Some participants in the discussion \u2014 principally, Deputy Secretary (of Defense) Paul Wolfowitz \u2013 raised the issue of whether we ought to look at Iraq as a possible source of terrorism, like what we had seen on 9/11. Now it enters the conversation, but it doesn\u2019t become a dominant feature of the conversation, at that point. I would say it\u2019s not until, you know, mid to late 2002 that Iraq starts to come up on the screen more frequently. \u201c\u2026 My recall of the meetings in September of 2001 is that President Bush listened but quickly took Iraq off the table. In other words, he did not show to me any sign at that point that he was interested in pursuing Iraq as something associated with 9/11.\u201d On Cheney as a consumer of intelligence: \u201cThe vice president was very aggressive in asking questions \u2013 particularly of intelligence officers. And we respected that. I mean, he\u2019s often portrayed as this dark presence who would come to CIA and, you know, lean hard on you. Well, we didn\u2019t see it that way. I mean, he would ask you tough questions. And he would ask them over and over again. That\u2019s for sure. And he had strong views and probably was looking for a particular answer. But he never pressed you to give that answer. He would be very respectful and polite in his questioning, in my personal experience and in my observation of him with analysts and others that he interacted with. \u2026 Vice President Cheney was probably among vice presidents, the most avid consumer of intelligence that I\u2019ve seen \u2013 in terms of his interest in it \u2013 the level of detail that he waded into. He read a lot of raw intelligence reports. The fact that he visited personally most of the intelligence agencies and spent a lot of time trying to understand what they did. I am not aware of any previous vice president taking that level of interest in intelligence.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Partisan posturing emerges over Boston bombings on Sunday talk shows Despite little evidence, Republicans hint of possible international terror ties Democrats argue against designating the suspect an enemy combatant Authors of immigration reform reject conservative calls to put off the issue Few answers have emerged to the myriad questions about the Boston Marathon bombing and its aftermath, but that didn\u2019t stop political leaders from clashing about what happened and why it did on Sunday talk shows. Republican members of Congress played up a possible connection to global terrorists and said the lone surviving suspect should be designated an enemy combatant to allow unfettered questioning and unlimited detention. Democratic legislators called for handling the 19-year-old suspect as a crime suspect rather than a war enemy, allowing the U.S. citizen the right to legal representation under federal law that could impose the death penalty. A closer look at their statements and arguments showed how politicians blend facts, conjecture and spin to push their side\u2019s agenda while countering arguments from across the aisle. 'The ball was dropped' on Boston suspect Bombing enflames immigration debate The week that changed Boston forever Solidarity with Boston in Bethlehem The facts so far tell a still-convoluted story. Tamerlan and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, brothers of northern Caucasus origin who had lived in the United States for years, allegedly set off two bombs near the finish line of Monday\u2019s Boston Marathon, killing three people and injuring more than 170. Graham: \u2018Ball was dropped\u2019 in probe of Tamerlan After the FBI released video footage and photos of the pair on Thursday, they allegedly shot to death a university police officer and carjacked a getaway vehicle, leading to a wild chase through Boston and its suburbs that ended with Tamerlan dead and Dzhokhar on the lam. He was captured Friday night to culminate a day of door-to-door searches in an unprecedented manhunt in parts of Boston and its suburbs. With authorities still trying to nail down exactly what happened and why, the political chatter on Sunday provided more partisan posturing than solid answers. Republicans focused on a six-month trip last year to Russia and perhaps his former Dagestan homeland and other Caucusus regions by Tamerlan Tsarnaev, the elder brother who some family members said had become a radicalized Islamist in recent years. Timeline: A look at Tamerlan\u2019s past The chairmen of the powerful House Intelligence and Homeland Affairs committees focused on Tamerlan\u2019s travels, insinuating links to terrorist training without making any definitive declarations or accusations. \u201cHe, we believe, may have actually traveled on an alias to get back to his home country,\u201d Rep. Mike Rogers, the Michigan Republican who chairs the intelligence panel, told NBC. \u201c\u2026 So you know he had some radicalization before he left.  You know that he didn\u2019t probably travel on his own name or some variation of his own name.  And when he comes back, he has a renewed interest in that radicalization belief process.\u201d Add it all up, Rogers said, and \u201cit would lead one to believe that\u2019s probably where he got that final radicalization to push him to commit acts of violence and where he may have received training on what we ultimately saw last Monday.\u201d Rep. Michael McCaul, the Republican from Texas who chairs the homeland security committee, hinted to reporters that Tamerlan made additional trips to the northern Caucasus region than the 2012 visit made public by authorities. \u2018Enemy combatant\u2019 can be tried in civilian court \u201cWe know he\u2019s starting to radicalize in 2009, which would lead me to the, um, yeah, I could speculate that he was probably going over there more often,\u201d said McCaul, who is privy to congressional briefings on the matter. \u201cWe don\u2019t have \u2013 I don\u2019t have the evidence of that just yet.  But that\u2019s obviously an area of focus.\u201d Asked specifically about confirmation that Tamerlan made other trips, McCaul acknowledged that \u201cit\u2019s unconfirmed at this point,\u201d but added: \u201cMy judgment is we\u2019ll probably see there were other trips to the region.\u201d Such conjecture seeks in part to raise the specter of international terrorism at a time when Congress is wrestling with deficit reduction issues including forced spending cuts to the military and other government services. While concerns of an international terrorism link to the Boston bombers remains high, conservatives seek any opportunity to reinforce the need to maintain military readiness and national security in order to protect it as a spending priority amid the austerity debate in Washington. Republican Rep. Peter King of New York, who has complained that America let down its guard against terrorism, told \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d he was referring specifically to Congress. \u201cSome of my own party want to start cutting funding for homeland security because they think this war is over,\u201d King said. \u201cIt\u2019s not.\u201d Meanwhile, Democratic legislators pushed back against GOP calls for designating 19-year-old Dzhokhar Tsarnaev a war enemy to allow unfettered interrogation and possible indefinite detention, like terrorism suspects at Guantanamo Bay. Instead, they argued the suspect, who is hospitalized in serious but stable condition with wounds that included a gunshot to the throat, should be treated as a crime suspect with the right to legal representation. \u201cI don\u2019t think we have to cross the line and say he should be an enemy combatant, which could be challenged in court,\u201d Democratic Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York told CNN. Boston\u2019s week of terror The issue dates to the \u201cwar on terror\u201d from the Bush administration after the 9/11 attacks, and remains a sore point for liberals who question the constitutionality of designating a naturalized citizen such as the younger Tsarnaev as an enemy combatant. Schumer and follow Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein of California emphasized that a federal criminal charge against Tsarnaev could carry the death penalty in an effort to show their party wasn\u2019t soft on terrorism. \u201cThe federal law allows the death penalty,\u201d Schumer said, noting that he wrote it in 1994. \u201cThis is just the kind of case that it should be applied to. In fact, the only other time it\u2019s been used since \u201994 is on (Oklahoma City bomber) Timothy McVeigh and given the facts that I\u2019ve seen, it would be appropriate to use the death penalty in this case and I would hope they would apply it in federal court.\u201d Feinstein told reporters that Tsarnaev could be interrogated now for any information on possible further terrorism threats under a public safety exception to immediately informing a suspect of Miranda rights. \u201cIf he\u2019s not Mirandized, it can\u2019t be used in a court of law,\u201d she said, noting authorities already had \u201cplenty of evidence\u201d that can be used to convict him. Suspects initially questioned under the public safety exemption and then later tried in civilian court include Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab, the \u201cunderwear bomber\u201d who attempted to blow up a Detroit-bound airliner on Christmas Day in 2009, and Faisal Shahzad for his 2010 attempt to detonate a bomb in Times Square. Conservative GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina made a similar argument to CNN in calling for Tsarnaev to be declared an enemy combatant for now, then later being criminally charged and put to trial in a civilian court. According to Graham, a public safety exception to reading Miranda rights will expire, meaning the ability to continue interrogating Tsarnaev could be jeopardized by his right to remain silent and be represented by an attorney. The public safety exception to the Miranda rule allows investigators to question suspects before apprising him of their rights when they believe there is an imminent public safety threat. Did one brother brainwash the other? Despite Graham\u2019s warning that the exception will expire, Attorney General Eric Holder has opened the door to longer interrogations for that purpose in cases involving \u201coperational\u201d terrorists. Another political dispute stemming from the Boston bombings involved calls by some conservative Republicans to put off consideration of bipartisan immigration reform legislation for now. GOP Sen. Dan Coats of Indiana said Sunday that Congress should wait until the emotional reaction to the bombings subsides before tackling the volatile issue of immigration. His comment to ABC followed a similar call last week by fellow Republican Sen. Chuck Grassley of Iowa, who noted the Tsarnaev brothers were immigrants. \u201cIt\u2019s important for us to understand the gaps and loopholes in our immigration system,\u201d Grassley said, asking \u201chow can individuals evade authorities and plan such attacks on our soil?\u201d Schumer, one of the \u201cGang of Eight\u201d senators who drafted the immigration plan, said some on the right who opposed the bill were using the Boston bombing as an excuse to stall the legislation. \u201cIf they have a reason, a suggestion as to how to change it based on what happened in Boston, we\u2019ll certainly be open to it,\u201d Schumer said. \u201cBut we\u2019re not going to let them use what happened in Boston as an excuse, because our law toughens things up.\u201d Graham, a Republican co-author, agreed it was time to tackle the immigration issue, saying \u201cwe need to move on.\u201d Immigration reform resonates with the Hispanic-American community, which is the nation\u2019s fastest-growing demographic and heavily supported President Barack Obama\u2019s re-election last year.

            "article_content": "Supporters of a bipartisan immigration reform bill try to avoid same fate as 2007 Delays and adding \"poison pill\" amendments sank previous reform bill Opponents have decried what they see as they hasty immigration reform efforts Different political landscape, stronger Latino voting bloc could shore up reform bid Opponents of a bipartisan Senate effort to reform the nation\u2019s immigration policies calculate that dragging out debate by offering so-called \u201cpoison pill\u201d amendments designed to tank support and stoking conservative ire on the airwaves will derail the proposal. It is a strategy that stymied the immigration overhaul efforts of 2007. Legislative aides and the bill\u2019s supporters worry that with days running out in the congressional calendar and a heavy plate of issues before lawmakers, efforts to overhaul the nation\u2019s immigration system could get sidelined. The so-called \u201cGang of Eight\u201d senators who have labored for months, largely in secret, are expected to discuss their proposal at a press conference on Thursday. But the pushback has already begun. \u201cIt seems pretty clear that they are pursuing a strategy of trying to draw this out as long as possible because this bill has to get done as quickly as possible,\u201d said Deepak Bhargava, executive director of the Center for Community Change, which advocates for low-income communities. \u201cIt\u2019s a ploy to try and throw sand in the gears and I suspect there will be a long list of poison pill amendments that will be offered through committee,\u201d Bhargava said. Delayed immigration rollout could face more opposition Rep. Louie Gohmert, R-Texas, said on C-SPAN that Monday\u2019s Boston Marathon bombing illustrated potential security risks posed by immigration even though authorities have made no connection between the two. Republican Rep. Steve King of Iowa told the National Review the attack should be an impetus to further investigate America\u2019s system of awarding student visas even though investigators have not linked it to any student or otherwise identified any suspects. Other Republicans on the Senate Judiciary Committee, which is set to hold hearings on the measure on Friday and Monday, questioned what they see as the hasty pace of considering the measure and have asked for more public hearings. \u201cThe bill produced by the \u201cGang of Eight\u201d is nearly 1,000 pages long and will impact every aspect of our society and every single American worker and taxpayer. It will take months\u2014not days or weeks as the majority proposes\u2014to review this legislation,\u201d Alabama Republican Sen. Jeff Sessions said in a statement. Last month, Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy, D-Vermont, sent a letter to several Senate conservatives urging them not to obstruct the upcoming legislative process relating to the issue. Senators formally file immigration bill \u201cI hope it is not your intention to discredit the process,\u201d Leahy said. \u201cI intend to proceed to comprehensive immigration reform with all deliberate speed. \u2026 I hope and expect that you will not delay consideration simply to prevent the legislation from moving forward.\u201d \u201cArtificial delays, delays for delays\u2019 sake, has tainted too much of the Senate\u2019s work over the last few years,\u201d he added. Leahy\u2019s letter was sent to Sessions, a high-ranking member of the committee. Panel Republicans Chuck Grassley of Iowa, Orrin Hatch and Mike Lee, both of Utah, and John Cornyn and Ted Cruz, both of Texas, also received copies of the letter. The bill\u2019s supporters have ample reason to worry about their efforts crumbling. In 2007, despite support from then-President George W. Bush and Republican Arizona Sen. John McCain, a bipartisan immigration proposal faced an avalanche of amendments on everything from increasing border security to creating a path to citizenship. At the same time, Republicans who supported the proposal were castigated in their home states on conservative talk radio. Republican Georgia Sen. Saxby Chambliss, who helped draft the bill, was booed at a state GOP conference when he tried to discuss the measure. Fellow Georgia Republican Sen. Johnny Isakson, who also helped draft the measure, received bricks at his office for a theoretical wall that could be used to build a border between the United States and Mexico. Immigration tops agenda as senators tour border Both lawmakers dialed back their support. Ultimately, the slew of amendments and intense criticism from conservative circles buried the proposal. It was never voted on in the Senate. \u201cLast time their delay tactics were about trying to gin up through conservative talk radio grassroots opposition to the bill,\u201d Bhargava said. This time, Florida Republican Sen. Marco Rubio, a potential 2016 presidential hopeful who has staked tremendous political capital on the bipartisan immigration reform push, is conducting interviews on conservative talk radio in advance of the bill\u2019s official roll out. The political landscape is also different now and that might also help back efforts of the bill\u2019s supporters, said Stephen Yale-Loehr, an immigration attorney who teaches at Cornell University Law School. \u201cI think it is different from 2007 because there is a feeling that we do need to reform our immigration laws,\u201d Yale-Loehr said. The Republican National Committee recently released a report analyzing its losses in the 2012 presidential election as well as seats in the House. It found that GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney lost big among Latinos, African-Americans and Asians. Romney\u2019s hardline stance on immigration, including his endorsement of a policy of \u201cself-deportation,\u201d may be one reason why he won just 27% of Latino voters \u2013 a lower percentage than the last two GOP presidential candidates. Since that loss, some Republicans have urged a softer tone and broader outreach in speaking to Latino communities. \u201cIf Hispanic Americans perceive that a GOP nominee or candidate does not want them in the United States, they will not pay attention to our next sentence,\u201d  the RNC report states. In one of its few policy recommendations, the report counsels Republicans to \u201cembrace and champion\u201d comprehensive immigration reform. Still, it will be \u201chard to get all the moving pieces to align,\u201d Yale-Loehr said of getting lawmakers to agree on an overhaul. \u201cThe chances of getting something enacted this year are less than 50% because of the short number of legislative days and the House Republicans may not feel the same sense of urgency to enact immigration reform legislation.\u201d Immigration rally draws thousands to Washington CNN\u2019s Alan Silverleib contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Bipartisan group of 4 senators tour border area in Arizona The senators are involved in immigration reform talks Obama steps up his push for legislative action on the issue Negotiators appear to be making progress on a number of key issues A bipartisan group of U.S. senators at the heart of the debate over immigration reform toured the U.S.-Mexico border in Arizona on Wednesday \u2013 the latest sign of growing legislative momentum on a polarizing issue that has been stalled on Capitol Hill for years. Arizona GOP Sens. John McCain and Jeff Flake were joined on the tour by New York\u2019s Chuck Schumer and Colorado\u2019s Michael Bennet, both Democrats.  The four men are part of a group of eight senators expected to unveil comprehensive legislation soon after Congress returns from its spring break in April. President Barack Obama also stepped up his push for a comprehensive bill, sitting down for interviews with the Telemundo and Univision.  While both interviews were embargoed, immigration was expected to dominate the discussion. Speaking at a naturalization ceremony at the White House on Monday, Obama said he expects significant legislation action next month. \u201cWe are making progress, but we\u2019ve got to finish the job,\u201d the president said.  \u201cI want to sign that bill into law as soon as possible.\u201d Immigration reform coming soon, Obama tells Spanish networks House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-California, told reporters Wednesday she is \u201coptimistic\u201d about the chances of legislative success. Democrats and Republicans have been bogged down for years over the question of how best to secure the country\u2019s border while resolving the status of roughly 11 million undocumented immigrants.  A rare political window appeared to open after last November\u2019s presidential election, when GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney performed dismally among Hispanic voters. Despite strong conservative resistance to a pathway to citizenship for undocumented immigrants, Republican leaders recognize their party\u2019s need to appeal more strongly to America\u2019s fastest growing minority group.  For his part, Obama is hoping to lock in a major second term legislative victory. A source familiar with the congressional negotiations has told CNN that the eight senators have tentatively reached agreement on some of the thorniest issues, such as a path to citizenship and metrics for securing the border. The groups is also working on a revamped guest worker program, the source noted. More specifically, one of the big outstanding issues appears to be around the future flow of low-skilled guest workers who would come to the United States to be maids, waiters, hotel workers or home-care workers.  Negotiators are discussing how much they would be paid, and how many workers would be allowed into the country each year. Labor unions influencing the talks are arguing for higher pay and fewer workers per year, since they are concerned about the effect guest workers would have on American workers.  Groups such as the Chamber of Commerce, however, are pushing senators for lower pay and high numbers of guest workers per year, since that will help businesses\u2019 bottom lines. On the issue of permanent legal status, the source told CNN the senators have essentially agreed to a 13 year path to citizenship.  According to the tentative agreement, it would take 10 years for illegal workers to get a green card to work legally in the U.S. and then an additional three years to move towards citizenship. Obama to visit Mexico, Costa Rica in May Illegal workers would have to pay a fine, back taxes, and have no criminal record. The senators, according to the source, have agreed that no illegal worker will be eligible for citizenship until the border is considered secure.  Figuring out how to measure that has been a major part of the talks. Others senators involved in the immigration talks include: Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina; Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Florida; Sen. Robert Menendez, D-New Jersey; and Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Illinois. Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy, D-Vermont, sent a letter to several strong Senate conservatives last week urging them not to obstruct the upcoming legislative process relating to the issue. \u201cI hope it is not your intention to discredit the process,\u201d Leahy said.  \u201cI intend to proceed to comprehensive immigration reform with all deliberate speed. \u2026 I hope and expect that you will not delay consideration simply to prevent the legislation from moving forward.\u201d \u201cArtificial delays, delays for delays\u2019 sake, has tainted too much of the Senate\u2019s work over the last few years,\u201d he added. Leahy\u2019s letter was sent to Alabama GOP Sen. Jeff Sessions, a high ranking member of the committee.  Committee Republicans Chuck Grassley of Iowa, Orrin Hatch of Utah, Mike Lee of Utah, John Cornyn of Texas, and Ted Cruz of Texas also received copies of the letter.

            "article_content": "Republican outreach to minority cited as a priority in new report The GOP will have to work hard to gain trust, voters in minority communities Previous GOP policy positions on immigration, entitlements a hurdle for some minorities Some platform changes may be needed in order to win over more minority voters Republican K. Carl Smith is African-American and he knows that the GOP\u2019s racial reckoning won\u2019t come from 100-page reports from party headquarters with carefully worded prescriptions about \u201coutreach\u201d to \u201cdemographic partners.\u201d Instead, the type of sea change needed to shake the GOP\u2019s image as a party of old, white and culturally-insulated men will require the type of profound grassroots shakeup that might make some in the GOP uneasy. \u201cYou got your establishment Republicans who want to keep things the same,\u201d said Smith, an Army veteran who grew up in Alabama during the Civil Rights era. \u201cThe status quo needs to go through some, I won\u2019t say diversity classes, but I\u2019ll say liberty classes and learn about helping people on the bottom of the ladder.\u201d He said the party also has to deal with small but noisy elements that co-opt any message of inclusiveness if it wants to win the \u201cpropaganda battle.\u201d Full CPAC coverage When Smith, founder of the Frederick Douglass Republicans, tried to share his message while leading a panel at last weekend\u2019s Conservative Political Action Conference in Maryland, he found himself face to face with that fringe. Smith said one young attendee said Douglass, an abolitionist, should have thanked his slave masters for giving him food and shelter and that segregation wasn\u2019t such a bad policy. The Republican National Committee knows it has major work ahead as it tries to make inroads with racial minorities, young voters and women. The group released a 100-page report analyzing its losses in the 2012 presidential election as well as seats in the House. GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney lost big among Latinos, African-Americans and Asians. \u201cThe report notes the way we communicate our principles isn\u2019t resonating widely enough,\u201d RNC Chairman Reince Priebus said. \u201cFocus groups described our party as \u2018narrow-minded,\u2019 \u2018out of touch,\u2019 and \u2018stuffy old men.\u2019\u201d \u201cIt all goes back to what our moms used to tell us: It\u2019s not just what we say; it\u2019s how we say it,\u201d Priebus continued. Republicans want to change perception of \u2018stuffy old men\u2019 Romney\u2019s hardline stance on immigration, including his endorsement of a policy of \u201cself-deportation,\u201d may be one reason why he won just 27% of Latino voters \u2013 a lower percentage than the last two GOP presidential candidates. But Romney isn\u2019t the only Republican politician who has used that type of rhetoric. Similar comments from other GOP politicians coupled with the occasional pronouncements of President Barack Obama as \u201clazy\u201d helps to cement for minorities an impression of the Republican Party as out of touch and out of sync with minority communities, said Andra Gillespie, an associate professor of political science at Emory University in Atlanta. Outreach and naming minorities to committee positions is great, Gillespie said, but the party has much harder work ahead. Party leaders will have to work to better understand the minority groups they are reaching out to. In the case of African-Americans and Latinos, that will mean recognizing the fact that a strong sense of \u201clinked fate\u201d means many members of this group may be loathe to take a hardline position on cutting entitlement programs, immigration or changing the Voting Rights Act because someone they know may be adversely affected, Gillespie said. \u201cIf prominent Republicans are signing amicus briefs supporting dismantling affirmative action, African-Americans and Latinos will have a problem with that,\u201d Gillespie said. She added that the GOP also won\u2019t win broader minority support \u201cin the budget talks advocating dismantling programs that disproportionately help people of color while keeping programs that are perceived in helping the well off.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s going to take some platform changes,\u201d Gillespie said. \u201cThe identity politics they decry is something minorities hold dear. That\u2019s a compromise some people will be unwilling to make.\u201d The RNC report underscored this point. Opinion: GOP has power where it counts - the states \u201cIf Hispanic Americans perceive that a GOP nominee or candidate does not want them in the United States, they will not pay attention to our next sentence,\u201d it states. In one of its few policy recommendations, the report counsels Republicans to \u201cembrace and champion\u201d comprehensive immigration reform. Lionel Sosa, a veteran Latino GOP strategist who has helped advise candidates since 1980, put it more bluntly. \u201cToken efforts, such as tamale parties, will no longer work,\u201d Sosa told CNN last year. \u201cWinning will require more than outreach. It will require inclusion.\u201d \u201cLatinos, African-Americans and people of other races must be represented in the important decision-making strategies of any given campaign, whether it be for a Democrat or Republican.\u201d For his part, Smith holds out hope that the GOP\u2019s attempts to bring more minorities into the Big Tent will align the party\u2019s views with those of Douglass, his personal hero who he says shared Republican values. But he\u2019s looking for more than platitudes about inclusiveness. The party, Smith said, has got to tie principles about self-reliance and getting weaned off government dependence to efforts to help people become entrepreneurs and gain a stronger economic foothold. \u201cThe Republican Party has to be sincere, otherwise the outcome is not going to work and it\u2019s going to fail,\u201d Smith said. 5 things post-CPAC: New faces, old music and winners/losers",

            "article_content": "Perez thanks President Obama in both English and Spanish Obama called on the Senate to quickly confirm Perez Perez is the first Hispanic nominated to Cabinet during Obama's second term NEW: Conservative senator calls nomination \"unfortunate and needlessly divisive\" Thomas Perez has climbed America\u2019s \u201cladder of opportunity\u201d and now can help others do the same, President Barack Obama said on Monday in nominating the assistant U.S. attorney general as labor secretary. The son of Dominican immigrants who worked different jobs such as collecting garbage to help pay for college, Perez has dedicated himself to fulfilling the promise of equal opportunity for all, Obama told a White House ceremony to introduce Perez, 51. CNN\u2019s Jessica Yellin reported earlier this month that Obama would name Perez to the Cabinet position. If confirmed by the Senate, the lone Hispanic Cabinet selection of Obama\u2019s second term so far would succeed Hilda Solis, who resigned in January. In brief remarks, Perez thanked Obama in both English and Spanish for what he called the honor of the opportunity. Economy adds 236,000 jobs Taco Bell's new taco creates 15,000 jobs Feb. unemployment down, job creation up He pledged to work with \u201cour partners\u201d in organized labor, the business community, grassroots organizations and Congress, adding that he looked forward to meeting with senators from both parties to discuss the way forward. \u201cTrue progress is possible if you keep and open mind, listen to all sides and focus on results,\u201d Perez said. Obama urged that Perez be confirmed \u201cas quickly as possible.\u201d Perez\u2019s nomination comes as the economy continues a sluggish recovery from recession, with unemployment hovering near 8%. The Labor Department, among other things, oversees analysis and reporting of unemployment statistics as well as occupational safety and other wage and employment issues. While some indicators show improvement, economists warn some fragility remains and political leaders are divided on policy prescriptions for stronger growth. Obama and Democrats call for a combination of stimulus spending, budget cuts and reforms to the tax system and entitlement programs to reduce chronic federal deficits and debt while maintaining government support for education, research and other areas they consider vital to economic development. Republicans seeking to shrink government say that reducing its cost is the fastest and best way to prompt growth by reducing regulations and lowering taxes. They call for spending cuts and entitlement reforms, as well as changes to the tax system that would reduce rates without increasing revenue. In nominating Perez, Obama called on him to continue efforts by Solis and her team on helping returning war veterans get jobs, improving worker safety in coal mines and other steps to strengthen workers\u2019 rights. \u201cLike so many Americans, Tom knows what it is like to climb the ladder of opportunity,\u201d Obama said, adding that Perez made protecting the promise of equal opportunity for all \u201ca cause of his life.\u201d The Labor Department would likely play a role in new employment programs under any comprehensive immigration reform. Perez\u2019s nomination pleased unions and workers\u2019 rights groups, but rankled Senate conservatives due in part to his record at the Justice Department. \u201cThis is an unfortunate and needlessly divisive nomination. The top priority of the secretary of labor should be to create jobs and higher wages for American workers. But Mr. Perez has aggressively sought ways to allow the hiring of more illegal workers,\u201d  said Sen. Jeff Sessions, an Alabama Republican and a senior member of the Judiciary Committee. \u201cMr. Perez has also had a controversial tenure at the Department of Justice where he has demonstrated a fundamentally political approach to the law.\u201d Perez, who has overseen the agency\u2019s civil rights division, has been active in several high-profile cases in recent years. In 2010, he launched a probe into the law enforcement tactics of Maricopa County, Arizona, Sheriff Joe Arpaio after the lawman\u2019s hard line anti-immigration policies led to accusations of civil rights violations. The Justice Department determined that Arpaio had engaged in \u201cpattern or practice of wide-ranging discrimination against Latinos and retaliatory actions against individuals who criticized\u201d his department\u2019s activities. Arpaio condemned the investigation as politically motivated and a \u201cwitch hunt\u201d provoked by the Obama administration\u2019s disfavor of the state\u2019s controversial immigration law. Perez also became involved in a controversial 2008 voting rights case after it drew attention from Republican legislators and became the target of a Justice Department inspector general\u2019s report. The watchdog concluded that that DOJ\u2019s voting rights section lacked professionalism and pointed out pervasive warring between employees who disagreed politically. The case stemmed from a complaint against members of the New Black Panther Party who stood outside a polling station in Philadelphia on Election Day dressed in boots and berets and carrying a nightstick. Civil charges for attempted voter intimidation were sought by the Bush administration, but later dropped against three of four defendants after Obama took office. Republicans accused the DOJ\u2019s political leadership of interfering in the decision. Though Perez had not yet been confirmed to oversee the civil rights division when the decision was made, he said in testimony to Inspector General Michael Horowitz in May 2010 that politics played no part in the decision. Horowitz was not satisfied with Perez\u2019s account of the situation, saying in his report that Perez should have tried to get more information before testifying. Perez was not accused of any wrongdoing, but he has been criticized for not doing enough to improve what the inspector general described as a dysfunctional department. Before rising to the Justice Department position, Perez led Maryland\u2019s Department of Labor, Licensing and Regulation. That office is charged with \u201csafeguarding workers, protecting consumers, providing a safety net and cultivating a thriving workforce,\u201d according to its website. He also spent 12 years as an attorney in the Justice Department\u2019s civil rights division, rising to become deputy assistant attorney general in the 1990s. Perez also worked for the late Sen. Edward Kennedy, a Massachusetts Democrat, and spent the final two years of the Clinton administration as head of the Health and Human Services Department\u2019s civil rights office.

            "article_content": "Companies push immigration reform lobbying blitz for different reasons Microsoft, Intel, Facebook want more visas for highly-skilled workers Private prisons want tough immigration laws to help keep detention facilities filled Lobbying efforts could help craft immigration reform legislation Big tech firms and private prisons represent two industries vigorously lobbying to influence the scope of legislation aimed at overhauling U.S. immigration policy, a political priority in Washington. Microsoft, Facebook, and Intel want lawmakers to support increasing the number of visas available to highly skilled workers, according to an analysis by the Center for Responsive Politics, which tracks the influence of money in politics. Others, like Corrections Corporation of America, which builds detention facilities to house illegal immigrants, have contributed heavily to the campaigns of lawmakers who take tough stances on the issue. In all, 359 lobbying clients pressed their positions on immigration reform to officials at nearly every level of government, including the White House, Congress and the  Homeland Security Department, according to the analysis for 2012. The figure is up from the 317 clients lobbying on immigration from the previous year. It is difficult to track exactly how much each spends on lobbying an issue, campaign finance experts say. However, tracking the number of times something specific is mentioned on disclosure reports indicates its importance to a company or industry. \u201cThey\u2019re not spending this money just willy-nilly. They have a goal and they\u2019re trying to achieve that goal legislatively,\u201d said Steve Ellis, vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense, a watchdog group. \u201cYou have to be sure they\u2019re writing the legislation for the right reasons and not just trying to benefit one particular company,\u201d Ellis said. President Barack Obama underscored the need for comprehensive immigration reform earlier this year stressing the need to better enforce related laws, provide a path to citizenship for the more than 11 million undocumented workers already in the country and reform the legal immigration system. The so-called \u201cGang of Eight\u201d in the Senate and a similar bipartisan group in the House are working on crafting a reform framework leading up to what could be one of the year\u2019s biggest legislative showdowns. What\u2019s in Senate immigration plan? \u201cThe reason immigration is on the table now is the outcome of the last election,\u201d said Judith Gans, manager of the immigration policy program at the University of Arizona. \u201cNo political party likes to lose and the Republican party realized that their unfriendly stance toward immigrants was creating a coalition in the Democratic Party.\u201d The upcoming legislative battle will create winners and losers, and businesses are doing everything they can to ensure they can influence the outcome. \u201cWe will see Congress make it easier for that high-skilled, cutting-edged talent to come to the U.S. But if they don\u2019t address the channels for low skilled workers to come to the U.S., illegal immigration will continue,\u201d Gans said. The nation\u2019s tech sector, which has come to rely strongly on highly trained and science-savvy foreign workers, has long had a vested interest in immigration policy. When Congress failed to take action on the issue, big business and their lobbyists turned their attention to agencies and lawmakers for support in increasing the number of H-1B visas. Those are used by companies to temporarily employ foreign workers with special skills. But H-1B visas are capped at 65,000 annually for those with undergraduate or professional degrees. Another 20,000 are reserved for candidates with graduate-level credentials. The competition is fierce for slots and available caps are often exhausted quickly. Microsoft spent $8 million last year in broader lobbying efforts and filed 33 disclosure reports dealing with immigration \u2014 twice the number of lobbying reports of companies like Intel. Microsoft, which contributed $814,645 to President Barack Obama\u2019s re-election campaign, submitted four reports showing that some of its lobbying efforts were directed at the executive office of the president. The company also lobbied Congress and 22 other federal agencies and offices on issues like corporate tax reform and antitrust law. But the second-highest number of lobbying reports filed by the company dealt with immigration. Other tech companies also lobbied heavily. Intel spent $3.7 million in overall lobbying and filed 16 reports. Facebook spent $3.9 million in overall lobbying and filed eight reports, including those for lobbying the executive office of the president and the White House. \u201cThe reality is that in the United States, we are creating unfilled jobs faster than we are creating new filled positions,\u201d Brad Smith, Microsoft\u2019s executive vice president and general counsel, said during a speech at the nonpartisan Brookings Institution last year about his industry\u2019s need for more highly-skilled workers. Tech companies say they look for qualified U.S. workers first, but are having a tough time finding college graduates with the needed skills to work in science and technology fields. A significant portion of these corporate workforces are comprised of well educated, highly-skilled foreign nationals who are highly sought after and can only go to work for an American company if they are extended an H1-B visa. Intel says it is encouraged by legislative changes in the works. Several proposals to expand the available number of visas are working their way through Congress. These include a bipartisan measure sponsored in part by Republican Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, considered a potential 2016 presidential candidate. The lawmaker is also part of the \u201cGang of Eight\u201d working on comprehensive immigration reform, which both parties view as a priority for capturing support from Hispanics, whose influence politically is growing. Politicians also are weighing the impact on business and how attracting the best workers helps innovation, product development and productivity. \u201cImmigration reform is critical issue for Intel,\u201d said company spokeswoman, Lisa Malloy. \u201cIn the last year, we have seen growing bipartisan support for high-skilled, employment-based visa reform.  This is very encouraging to Intel.\u201d Another \u201cGang of Eight\u201d member, Sen. John McCain has changed his views on immigration over the years. For instance, the Arizona Republican first supported and later opposed a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants. He is also the fourth-highest recipient of campaign donations from Corrections Corporation of America. House Appropriations Committee Chairman Hal Rogers and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, both Kentucky Republicans, are other notable recipients of that company\u2019s campaign donations, according to Center for Responsive Politics data. \u201cThe private prison industry is responsible for 16% of federal prisoners in the U.S. and makes a substantial portion of its profits from detention centers for illegal immigrants,\u201d the group said. \u201cIllegal immigration creates a pool of potential prisoners and there\u2019s some incentive to them wanting to have input on those policies,\u201d Gans said. In one case last year, lobbyists representing CCA were paid $60,000 to monitor \u201cissues pertaining to the construction and management of private prisons and detention facilities,\u201d according a federal lobbying disclosure report. Corrections Corporation of America spent $970,000 last year to lobby Congress and the U.S. Marshals Service on a variety of issues. It says it supports a bipartisan group of lawmakers who support or are \u201copen minded to the merits of public-private partnership and the related services we provide.\u201d The company says its lobbying effort has been aimed at ensuring it understands reforms related to new civil detention facilities being pursued by Immigration and Customs Enforcement. \u201cNot a single firm hired by CCA lobbies on our behalf for or against immigration enforcement or detention policies. Every firm we engage with is contractually bound to adhering to this strict policy. The primary focus of our lobbying efforts is education on the merits and benefits of public-private partnership in corrections and detention generally, and the relevant services CCA provides,\u201d said company spokesman Steven Owen. Construction, agricultural, leisure and hospitality were among other industries also lobbying Congress and federal agencies heavily last year on such issues as changing the nation\u2019s guest worker program. Whether spending on immigration lobbying will have any impact remains to be seen, policy and lobbying experts say. \u201cLobbying on immigration reform is like lobbying on any complicated legislation in DC: messy and unpredictable. Just as with tax reform and health care reform, every affected constituency in the immigration debate is pushing their own agenda,\u201d said Stephen Yale-Loehr, a veteran immigration attorney. \u201cSometimes the stars align and a bill gets passed,\u201d Yale-Loehr said. \u201cOften, however, the effort fails, despite or because of everyone\u2019s efforts.\u201d",

            "article_content": "NEW: GOP senators who dined with President Obama call it a good first step NEW: Obama invites House Budget Committee leaders to lunch on Thursday President is criticized for his handling of the forced spending cuts issue He seeks a \"caucus of common sense\" on fiscal issues and other priorities Less than seven weeks into his second term, President Barack Obama seems mired in the same uncertainty over how to deal with recalcitrant and at times obstructionist Republicans that dominated his volatile first term. While the president and his team insist he is the reasonable one in the endless debate over taxes and spending, the failure last week to deliver a deal with Congress to avert forced spending cuts has harmed Obama\u2019s poll numbers and raised questions about his strategy. Critics cite a hyper-partisan blame campaign by Obama that stretched and at times obliterated the truth about the forced spending cuts, as well as the eventual political showdown with congressional Republicans last Friday that yielded nothing but public confusion and disenchantment. Borger: For Obama and GOP, much to chew over Rep. King: Obama hasn't shown leadership Now the president appears to be calibrating his campaign-style efforts to generate public outrage against Republicans by reaching out to GOP legislators, starting with dinner Wednesday night with 12 GOP senators, including some harsh critics. Obama also invited House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan, R-Wisconsin, and the panel\u2019s top Democrat, Rep. Chris Van Hollen of Maryland, to lunch Thursday, a White House official said. Next week, the president will go across town to the U.S. Capitol for separate meetings he requested with Republicans in the House and Senate. The Wednesday dinner was described by participants as a frank and beneficial discussion on deficit reduction, including how to bring about bipartisan support for so far intractable issues such as reforms to the tax system and popular entitlement programs. No negotiations took place, they stressed, describing it as an opening exchange of what appeared to be a trust-building exercise after the past four years of deeply partisan divide. \u201cWe were working together and talking together about the real essence of our problem and how we can get this thing turned from this never-ending, short-term-fix, fiscal cliff stuff into a long-term solution to our fiscal problem,\u201d Sen. Dan Coats, R-Indiana, told CNN on Thursday. \u201cI was pleased that it was that substantive.\u201d Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pennsylvania, said he believed common ground could be reached in some areas but added that \u201cit\u2019s not going to happen over one dinner.\u201d While the main focus of current Washington debate involves fiscal issues, Obama also seeks to work out compromises on other priorities, including immigration reform and tighter gun laws. A White House official told CNN on Wednesday that the president\u2019s outreach was a \u201cchange in approach\u201d following the deadline-driven atmosphere of the previous week, when the forced spending cuts took effect on March 1. Obama dinner with Republicans signals shift in approach It follows a series of speeches by Obama in February intended to raise pressure on congressional Republicans to accept his insistence on more tax revenue as part of any plan to replace the forced spending cuts or reach a broader deficit reduction agreement. No agreement ensued, and now Obama refers to finding a \u201ccaucus of common sense\u201d that would include Republicans willing to go against their leadership\u2019s unyielding opposition to any kind of further tax increases after they agreed in January to return rates on top income earners to higher levels of the 1990s. Forced spending cuts cutting into Obama\u2019s numbers? Republicans, including House Speaker John Boehner, argue that Obama only wants to make them look bad to give Democrats a chance to win back control of the House in the 2014 elections. They question whether the president truly wants an agreement on fiscal issues, or if he merely seeks to depict Republicans as obstructionist while continuing to push his campaign themes of equal opportunity and shared burden from last year\u2019s election. \u201cWe\u2019re expecting over the next 22 months to be the focus of this administration as they attempt to annihilate the Republican Party,\u201d Boehner said in a January speech. \u201cAnd let me just tell you, I do believe that is their goal \u2013 to just shove us into the dustbin of history.\u201d To Brown University political scientist Wendy Schiller, Obama needs to work harder for results instead of remaining in election campaign mode. \u201cSpending energy for the next year-and-a-half doing nothing and blaming Republicans on the long shot you get the House back is woefully misguided and bad for the country,\u201d Schiller told CNN. \u201cAmericans did not re-elect President Obama to play the partisan blame game. They re-elected him to run the country, and that is what he should be doing.\u201d She cited the president\u2019s series of recent speeches that warned of myriad troubles including job losses, released criminals, reduced security and other threats if Congress failed to replace or soften the forced spending cuts, known in Washington jargon as sequestration. Several claims turned out to be excessive, as noted by GOP critics and media fact-checkers, putting Obama and the administration on the defensive. \u201cHis big gamble was to overplay the impact of the sequester on the daily lives of most Americans,\u201d Schiller said, adding that it failed to effectively sway public opinion because \u201cwhen people can\u2019t see the damage, they don\u2019t worry about the damage.\u201d At the same time, Republicans are putting more pressure on Obama by better tailoring their opposition to his policies instead of repeating the sweeping rejection and calls for repeal that characterized last year\u2019s election campaign. \u201cRepublicans are being more strategic in how they\u2019re approaching the budget,\u201d said Darrell West, the vice president and director of governance studies at the Brookings Institution. \u201cAs opposed to saying \u2018no\u2019 to everything, they are picking and choosing their fights.\u201d A CNN compilation of recent national polls shows a drop in Obama\u2019s approval rating to below 50% in recent weeks as the debate over the forced spending cuts reached its zenith. In addition, a CBS News poll Monday showed that more Americans blame Republicans in Congress than Obama and Democrats for the failure to avert the forced spending cuts, but the gap between the two has narrowed, compared with earlier polls by other organizations. The results come as the government and nation wrestle with the $85 billion in forced spending cuts over the rest of fiscal year 2013, which ends on September 30. The mandatory, across-the-board cuts to defense and other discretionary government spending \u2013 but not entitlement programs such as Social Security and Medicare \u2013 occurred after Obama and Congress were unable to work out a compromise to replace or avert them. They amount to roughly 9% for a broad range of non-defense programs and 13% for the Pentagon over the remaining seven months of the fiscal year. While both sides oppose the government-wide nature of the cuts, with no leeway for shifting funds to protect specific programs, conservatives argue the total amount is a manageable slice in spending while Democrats say it will cause unnecessary harm. The harshest impacts won\u2019t be evident until April at the earliest, but economists and leaders of both parties warn the cuts will slow the economy and cause pain for many Americans. One immediate impact came Tuesday when the White House announced it was canceling all tours because of the forced spending cuts. \u201cDue to staffing reductions resulting from sequestration, we regret to inform that White House tours will be canceled effective Saturday, March 9, 2013, until further notice,\u201d said an automated message at the visitor center\u2019s hotline. \u201cUnfortunately, we will not be able to reschedule affected tours.\u201d Schiller, the Brown University political scientist, called the move \u201cmonumentally stupid,\u201d saying people will blame Obama instead of House Republicans. She added it also \u201csmacks of such elitism not to understand how that might ruin a trip to (Washington) for a family that planned it for a while.\u201d The president has opened himself to other accusations of elitism, including a bachelor weekend in Florida last month to play golf with Tiger Woods while the first lady and their two daughters were on a ski holiday. Republicans have targeted the Florida golf trip for its cost to taxpayers at a time of fiscal austerity, with one GOP legislator proposing that no such travel by the president should be funded by taxpayers until the White House tours are resumed. The next political showdown is set for March 27, the deadline for Congress to authorize more government funding or bring a partial shutdown. On Wednesday, the House passed its version of the funding authorization proposal, known as a continuing resolution, which includes the forced spending cuts but softens their impacts on the military and veterans affairs programs. It now goes to the Senate, where leaders of both parties said they expect changes to the House plan by Democrats, leading to further negotiations in an effort to avoid a partial government shutdown when current government funding authorization expires in three weeks\u2019 time. Meanwhile, Obama made clear his battles with Republicans are far from over. After Senate Republicans on Wednesday blocked his nominee for the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia for a second time, Obama said in a statement he was \u201cdeeply disappointed.\u201d \u201cToday\u2019s vote continues the Republican pattern of obstruction,\u201d the president said. \u201cMy judicial nominees wait more than three times as long on the Senate floor to receive a vote than my predecessor\u2019s nominees.\u201d Obama is the only president in recent memory never to have successfully placed a nominee on the D.C. Circuit, which handles many high-profile appeals, including executive authority to fight terrorism and broader congressional power.

As he does the television interview circuit this week around the release of a new book,     \u201cImmigration Wars: Forging an American Solution,\u201d the former Florida governor and son and brother of former presidents is openly discussing his thinking on a run for the White House in 2016. Bush told CNN on Tuesday he wouldn\u2019t make a decision in the near future. Asked if he\u2019ll make a decision in 2014, Bush said he didn\u2019t know and added that \u201cthe only thing I\u2019ve decided is I\u2019m not going to think about it for 2013. It\u2019s just too far out for me personally.\u201d Bush passed on running for the Republican presidential nomination in 2008 and 2012. Instead, he\u2019s filled the role of a party elder statesman since leaving office in January 2007 after two terms as governor. Hanging over Bush is what can be described as Bush fatigue \u2013 the idea that a Jeb Bush bid for the White House would carry his family\u2019s political baggage. His father, George H.W. Bush, served one term before losing his 1992 re-election campaign against then-Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton. The elder Bush angered many conservatives by breaking his \u201cno new taxes\u201d pledge. Brother George W. Bush served two terms but left office in January 2009 as a very unpopular president, even among Republicans, who were angered by his support of federal spending increases and his 2008 bailout of Wall Street during the financial crisis. U.S. ready for another Pres. Bush? Bush's shifting stances in immigration Bush '41' opens up about Bush '43' George H.W. Bush reveals letters to son From Katrina to 9/11, Bush 41 opens up about his presidential son That lingering feeling was a factor behind Jeb Bush\u2019s decision not to run in the past election cycle, even though some Republicans urged him to consider a bid, said CNN chief political analyst Gloria Borger. \u201cOne of the reasons that I think Jeb Bush decided not to run this last time was that he thought there was still Bush fatigue in this country,\u201d Borger said. \u201cSo the question is, if you skip ahead, four more years, will there still be Bush fatigue? We just don\u2019t know.\u201d And if Bush does run, his family ties will put him in uncharted territory, said CNN polling director Keating Holland. \u201cThere have been plenty of presidential candidates whose fathers also ran for president, and a few whose brothers have been candidates. But if Jeb Bush throws his hat in the ring, he will be the first candidate in history who fits into both categories,\u201d Holland added. \u201cDoes that help because the Bush \u2018brand name\u2019 is well known, or hurt because Jeb would be judged by the public based on things he did not do himself? Historically speaking, there is no way to tell.\u201d READ MORE: Jeb Bush\u2019s controversial immigration proposals But GOP strategist and CNN contributor Ana Navarro said Jeb Bush is free of the Bush fatigue, at least among Republicans. \u201cI think the Bush fatigue doesn\u2019t apply to Jeb. And even if it did, among Republicans it\u2019s been replaced with Obama fatigue,\u201d said Navarro, a longtime friend and supporter of the former Florida governor. If Bush does decide to run, and were he to win the 2016 GOP nomination, he could face off in the general election against a member of another famous political family \u2013 Hillary Clinton. While the former first lady, senator, presidential candidate and secretary of state says she has no plans to run again for the White House, she hasn\u2019t ruled out a bid, and if she did run, she\u2019d be the early favorite to win her party\u2019s nomination. And if Bush doesn\u2019t run, there\u2019s the chance we could see a future White House bid from the next generation of the Bush family. Both of Bush\u2019s sons are considering runs for public office. Bush told CNN that he now understands what his father went through. \u201cI know what my dad feels like, why he would get emotional every time he was in a setting where George or I were in pursuit of some office of some kind.\u201d",

            "article_content": "The measure now goes to President Obama to be signed into law House Republicans struggle again with an issue important to women, minorities The House rejects the GOP measure before approving the Senate version The legislation extends and expands the act that supporters credit with saving lives An expanded Violence Against Women Act won bipartisan approval on Thursday from the U.S. House after Republicans failed to pass their own proposal due to a party split on an issue important to women and minority groups. The measure now goes to President Barack Obama, who said in a statement that it was \u201can important step towards making sure no one in America is forced to live in fear.\u201d \u201cI look forward to signing it into law as soon as it hits my desk,\u201d Obama said. TIME photos: A portrait of domestic violence Thursday\u2019s votes reflected an emerging political reality in the GOP-led House, with a minority of Republicans joining Democrats to pass legislation that has broad public support, including from increasingly influential demographics such as Hispanic Americans. Obama: Good job, Joe By a vote of 166-257, the GOP version of the Violence Against Women Act failed to win a majority after almost 90 minutes of debate. The House then voted 286-138 to pass the Senate version, with 87 Republicans joining all 199 Democrats to provide majority support. Originally passed in 1994 and reauthorized since, the act provides support for organizations that serve domestic violence victims. Criminal prosecutions of abusers are generally the responsibility of local authorities, but the act stiffened sentences for stalking under federal law. Supporters credit the act with sharply reducing the number of lives lost to domestic violence over the past two decades. Last year, the House and Senate were unable to compromise on another extension of the act, with Republicans opposing Democratic attempts to specify inclusion of native Americans, undocumented immigrants and lesbian, transgender and bisexual women. Opinion: The plague of violence against women However, exit polls showed Obama won strong support among women, Latino voters and gay and lesbian voters in the November election that also strengthened the Democratic majority in the Senate and weakened the Republican majority in the House. Republicans then changed their stance and agreed to bring up the measure in the new Congress as long as they could offer their own version. The Republican proposal deleted provisions from the Senate measure that gave tribal authorities jurisdiction to prosecute cases on Indian reservations, specifically targeted discrimination of LGBT victims, and allowed undocumented immigrant survivors of domestic violence to seek legal status. In debate before Thursday\u2019s votes, Rep. Kevin Cramer, R-North Dakota, said the Senate version includes legal precedents of expanded sovereignty that could be subject to court challenge. Opinion: Rubio missed the year of the woman \u201cPlease consider the damage we have done if a court overturns this act and its protection all because we wanted a good slogan instead of a good law,\u201d Cramer said. House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi of California and others repeatedly questioned why Republicans would seek to weaken a measure that received strong bipartisan support in a 78-22 Senate vote earlier this year. A majority of Senate Republicans backed the act, along with every woman senator regardless of party, Pelosi noted. \u201cIt\u2019s really hard to explain why, what eyes the Republicans are looking through, that they do not see the folly of their ways in the legislation they are proposing,\u201d Pelosi said. Democratic Rep. Gwen Moore of Wisconsin, herself a rape victim, paraphrased the question of rights activist Sojourner Truth, a 19th century escaped slave and civil rights advocate. \u201cAin\u2019t they women?\u201d Moore shouted in reference to native American, undocumented immigrant and LGBT women. In response, Republican Rep. Cathy McMorris Rodgers of Washington challenged Democratic claims that the GOP version excluded any women, saying it was all-inclusive. A global push to end violence with song and dance House Majority Leader Eric Cantor of Virginia said the goal was to \u201cmake sure all women are safe,\u201d and he described the Republican version as an attempt to \u201cimprove on\u201d what the Senate sent over. However, Pelosi noted that hundreds of advocacy groups supported the Senate version as the best way forward. \u201cThis is a remarkable day because we have clarity between the two proposals,\u201d she said, noting one had support from both parties in the Senate and the president while the other was opposed by \u201calmost everybody who has anything to do with the issue of violence against women.\u201d The final vote on Thursday followed the same pattern as votes on other legislation at the end of the previous Congress, including the agreement to avoid some impacts of the fiscal cliff. A divide between conservative and more moderate Republicans prevented House GOP leaders from being able to pass their proposed fiscal cliff legislation at the end of the year. Under public pressure ratcheted up by Obama, the House ended up approving a Democratic proposal that raised taxes on the nation\u2019s top income earners, a key campaign theme in the November election opposed by the GOP. The measure passed with backing from most or all Democrats and dozens of Republicans. Such a dynamic signals the continuing inability of House Speaker John Boehner to marshal his GOP members on some of the most contentious issues coming up, such as deficit reduction and immigration reform. Boehner risks his standing as a party leader if he continues conceding on measures that become law without majority support from House Republicans, which also would fuel continuing unrest by conservatives who traditionally comprise the GOP base. Domestic violence bill vote critical test of more inclusive GOP According to advocacy groups, the Senate version of the Violence Against Women Act  approved Tuesday strengthens protections of particular groups of women at particular risk. For example, one in three native women will be raped in their lifetime, according to the Indian Law Resource Center. Three in five will be physically assaulted, and native women also are killed at a rate 10 times the national average, the center said. The National Congress of American Indians addressed the issue in a December 20 letter to Cantor. Beyond vomiting, how to prevent rape It described situations in which beatings and rapes by non-native men were declined for prosecution at a federal level and returned to a tribal court as a misdemeanor. Federal law currently prohibits tribal courts from imposing a jail sentence of more than a year, so they generally do not prosecute felonies. In many instances, such cases are dismissed altogether and a defendant can walk free until a grand jury indictment can be obtained. \u201cThe federal criminal justice system is simply not equipped to handle local crimes, and this is the primary reason that tribes seek local control over these crimes that are plaguing our communities,\u201d the letter said. On undocumented immigrants, Human Rights Watch has found that immigrant farm workers are especially at risk for domestic abuse and argued provisions in the Senate bill \u201cwould go some way toward fixing the problem.\u201d Those in the LGBT community are another high-risk group that will be affected by the Violence Against Women Act. They experience violence at the same rate as heterosexuals but are less likely to report it. When they do, many are denied services. About 45% of LGBT victims were turned away when they sought help from a domestic violence shelter and nearly 55% of those who sought protection orders were denied them, according to the National Task Force to End Sexual and Domestic Violence Against Women. Opinion: GOP House\u2019s inaction on VAWA shows bigotry Vice President Joe Biden, who helped spearhead the original Violence Against Women Act in 1994 when he was a U.S. senator, said Thursday that domestic violence dropped by 64% since then. \u201cI am pleased that this progress will continue, with new tools for cops and prosecutors to hold abusers and rapists accountable, and more support for all victims of these crimes,\u201d Biden said in a statement.

            "article_content": "NEW: Some conservatives protest planned release of certain immigration detainees Military leaders say readiness will be compromised if the cuts take full effect Republicans seek to blame Obama and Democrats for the situation The two sides remain divided over taxes as part of the solution Three days before forced spending cuts portrayed by most as an economic body blow, President Barack Obama and Republican rivals relied on spin versus substance Tuesday in trying to prod a deeply divided Congress into action to avert the harshest impacts. Government officials and military leaders continued warning of serious consequences if Congress fails to agree on an alternative to the mandatory $85 billion in cuts for the rest of fiscal year 2013, which ends on September 30. Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke said Tuesday the automatic cuts will slow the already sluggish economy, harming the still-moderate recovery from recession. Meanwhile, Immigration and Customs Enforcement said it will release \u201cseveral hundred\u201d immigration detainees to \u201cless costly\u201d forms of supervision because of the imminent cuts, known in Washington jargon as sequestration. That brought immediate protests from some conservative Republicans. Arizona Gov. Jan Brewer called the move \u201cpure political posturing and the height of absurdity.\u201d Republican leaders have criticized Obama administration warnings as scare tactics, but also said the cuts would be bad policy and should be changed. Only rigid fiscal conservatives have backed the concept of mandatory deep spending cuts as a painful first step of deficit reduction. Obama headed to military country in Virginia, where local residents will bear the brunt of cuts to defense spending, to urge Newport News shipyard workers to pressure Congress for a solution. Insisting he wasn\u2019t interested in political spin, Obama acknowledged the cuts set to take effect Friday  \u201cwon\u2019t be felt overnight, but it will be real,\u201d adding it means lost jobs and weakened national security. He called the situation \u201ca self-inflicted wound that doesn\u2019t have to happen,\u201d saying the goal of reducing the federal deficit can be achieved in a smarter way if Republicans will compromise on including additional tax revenue as part of the solution. \u201cI need you to keep up the fight. If you do, Congress will listen,\u201d said Obama, who spoke with a huge ship propeller as a backdrop. Talk Back: Who do you believe when it comes to forced budget cuts? Meanwhile, House Speaker John Boehner expressed continuing frustration over what he called a lack of leadership by Obama and Senate Democrats. The House passed two bills in the last Congress that would have replaced the mandatory cuts of sequestration with other reductions that avoid harming the military, a concept rejected by Democrats as shifting the impact of deficit reduction to the middle class and needy Americans. \u201cWe should not have to move a third bill before the Senate gets off their ass and begins to do something,\u201d Boehner told reporters on Tuesday. In response, House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi of California said bills passed by the previous Congress no longer matter, and that the Constitution requires legislation involving appropriations and revenue to originate in the House. \u201cThere\u2019s not much that is being accomplished by what they are doing,\u201d Pelosi said of House GOP leaders, calling their refusal to act on the matter \u201cirresponsible\u201d and \u201cmindless.\u201d The forced cuts were written into law in 2011 to be intentionally indiscriminate so that legislators would compromise on an alternative instead of allowing them to take effect. However, election year politics in 2012 prevented an agreement, and the continuing partisan divide over how to reduce or at least control chronic federal deficits and debt caused the widely opposed spending cuts to become imminent. Conflicting messages in the increasingly heated debate raised confusion about exactly what will happen if the spending cuts go into effect. At a House subcommittee hearing on Tuesday, the heads of the nation\u2019s military services warned of serious problems if the full effect of cuts are allowed to happen. Opinion: If spending is cut, GOP will get the blame Gen. Ray Odierno, the Army chief of staff, said the pending cuts would hollow out the military and were \u201cnot in the best interest of our national security.\u201d In particular, he said reduced spending for this year would reduce training, diminish the special operations command and result in layoffs and furloughs of civilian staff that will delay medical care for soldiers and their families. Rep. Harold Rogers of Kentucky, the GOP chairman of the House Appropriations Committee, told the panel that the spending cuts were \u201cboth terrible politics and terrible policy\u201d that would impair the nation\u2019s overall military readiness. That contrasted with conservative Sen. John Cornyn, R-Texas, who said Monday that the  cuts won\u2019t be as harmful as the Obama administration warns. The veteran senator conceded that he initially agreed with dire predictions from the administration and top Republicans of major harm to the nation\u2019s military. After looking into the situation, Cornyn said he now argues that the Pentagon will still see its budget go up despite the forced cuts. Senate Republicans are considering a proposal this week that could alleviate some impacts of the cuts by giving the president flexibility to decide where they would occur. The proposal is the GOP counter to a Democratic plan to replace the sequester with more tax revenue collected from millionaires, as well as eliminating agriculture subsidies and reducing defense spending after the end of combat operations in Afghanistan next year. Top Senate Republican doubts damage from defense cuts Under the law that created the forced spending cuts, neither the Pentagon or government agencies can shift money to protect some programs or operations from reduced funding. While Republicans are divided over how much flexibility Obama should get to avoid the worst impacts of the cuts, they appear unified in opposing any increase in tax revenue to partially offset them. A January agreement that raised tax rates on top income earners while putting off the forced cuts for two months provided all tax revenue Republicans were willing to consider, party leaders say. \u201cWe can either secure these reductions more intelligently or we can do it the president\u2019s way with across the board cuts,\u201d Senate GOP leader Mitch McConnell said Tuesday. \u201cBut one thing Americans simply will not accept is another tax increase to replace spending reductions we already agreed to.\u201d Obama addressed that viewpoint in his remarks in Virginia, saying there were \u201ctoo many Republicans in Congress right now who refuse to compromise even an inch when it comes to closing tax loopholes and special interest tax breaks.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019s holding things up right now,\u201d the president said. \u201cKeep in mind, nobody\u2019s asking them to raise income tax rates.  All we\u2019re asking is to consider closing tax loopholes and deductions that (Boehner) said he was willing to do just a few months ago.\u201d The full impact of the cuts won\u2019t be felt for at least a month, until after a March 27 deadline for Congress to agree on extending funding for the government for the rest of the fiscal year. An agreement on the overall government funding could soften or eliminate the cuts and much of the hyperbole this week involved posturing for the broader debate of coming weeks.

            "article_content": "Leaked draft of President Obama's immigration plan sparks uproar Some Republicans accuse the president of undermining Senate talks The White House calls the draft a backup plan if Congress fails to act A bipartisan group of senators is working on a possible agreement Whether a political ploy or bona fide proposal, a leaked version of President Barack Obama\u2019s draft immigration plan raised Republican hackles while bringing some additional focus to the debate. The draft plan reported over the weekend by USA Today and confirmed to CNN by an administration official included a possible path to coveted permanent residency in eight years for most of the nation\u2019s estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants. It also called for steps to strengthen border security and the E-Verify system to check the immigration status of workers. GOP critics pounced, with some objecting to any form of what they label \u201camnesty\u201d for those in the country illegally. Others accused Obama and the White House of dirty tricks by going public with their draft as a bipartisan group of senators works on a possible agreement. Conservative Sen. Jeff Sessions of Alabama complained on Monday that both the Obama draft and the talks involving the Senate\u2019s so-called Gang of Eight seek to \u201cconfer legal status and work authorization on Day One in exchange for promises of future enforcement on which this administration will never deliver.\u201d \u201cPerhaps this leak, and what it reveals, may mark the beginning of the collapse of this new scheme to force through a fatally flawed plan,\u201d Sessions said in a statement. Others accused Obama of deliberately floating an unacceptable plan so that Republicans would reject it, bringing the party further disfavor from Hispanic Americans, the nation\u2019s fastest-growing demographic. Rep. Burgess: Citizenship path not easy Schumer optimistic on immigration reform Obama: Harvest immigrants' talents \u201cDoes the president want a result, or does he want another cudgel to beat up Republicans so that he can get political advantage in the next election?\u201d veteran GOP Sen. John McCain of Arizona said Sunday on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d To former Rep. Connie Mack, a Florida Republican, \u201ca little bit of this is show from everyone, including the president\u2019s side.\u201d Regardless of how it happened, the leak of Obama\u2019s plan \u201cplays into the fears\u201d of Republicans that the president prefers keeping the issue alive for political advantage, Mack told CNN on Monday. His wife \u2013 former Republican Rep. Mary Bono Mack of California \u2013 agreed that the leak added to what she called an already deep trust deficit in Washington. \u201cThe American people would be astonished if they knew how little trust existed between the two parties when we have to work together like this,\u201d Bono Mack said on CNN. She acknowledged tossing the president\u2019s plan into the debate was \u201ca good way to move a bill.\u201d \u201cYou know, come out farther to the left, make the room on the right,\u201d Bono Mack said. \u201cBut in this case, start with that trust.\u201d Administration officials insisted Obama wanted Congress to work out an agreement that can win support from both parties. \u201cWe will be prepared with our own plans if these ongoing talks between Republicans and Democrats up on Capitol Hill break down,\u201d Obama\u2019s new chief of staff, Denis McDonough, said Sunday on CBS\u2019s \u201cFace the Nation.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s no evidence that they have broken down yet. We are continuing to support that.\u201d He added that he hoped the two sides \u201cdon\u2019t get involved in some kind of typical Washington back-and-forth sideshow here and rather just \u2026 roll up their sleeves and get to work\u201d on writing a comprehensive immigration bill. Along with the Senate talks on possible legislation, House members from both parties also are involved in their own discussions. The draft plan reported by USA Today calls for an eight-year path to permanent residency for undocumented immigrants, who would face a criminal background check and have to pay back taxes, learn English and get a new \u201clawful prospective immigrant\u201d visa. On the day after last week\u2019s State of the Union address, in which Obama called for comprehensive immigration reform, he met with the four Democratic senators involved in the Gang of Eight talks to reiterate what he considers to be the main principles for a final agreement. According to the White House, those principles include \u201ccontinuing to strengthen border security, creating an earned path to citizenship, holding employers accountable and streamlining legal immigration.\u201d Republicans stung by the overwhelming support for Obama from Latino voters that helped the president win re-election in November are divided over how to proceed on immigration. Conservatives generally oppose any breaks for those who came to America illegally although some, like Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, contend the party must adopt a modern approach to an issue with such strong economic and social impacts. Rubio, who gave the GOP response to Obama\u2019s State of the Union address, displayed the party\u2019s conflicted posture on the issue that night. He didn\u2019t mention his past support of a route to legal status for undocumented immigrants now in the United States, but advocated a non-specific \u201cresponsible, permanent solution to the problem.\u201d First, he said, \u201cwe must follow through on the broken promises of the past to secure our borders and enforce our laws.\u201d When news of the leaked Obama proposal emerged, Rubio immediately criticized it as \u201cdisappointing to those of us working on a serious solution.\u201d On the Democratic side, some of the distrust noted by Bono Mack is evident. Remembering similar bipartisan talks on major issues, such as the Gang of Six that spent months working on a health care overhaul in 2009 without every reaching an agreement, they want to make sure Congress gets legislation to consider. \u201cI know that Senator Rubio was upset with this leak,\u201d Democratic Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York told CNN on Sunday. \u201cI am not upset. We\u2019ve talked to Senator Rubio and he is fully on board with our process. And I am very hopeful that in March we will have a bipartisan bill.\u201d Schumer said the mechanics of politics was obvious: \u201cIf a Democrat, the president or anyone else puts out what they want on their own, it\u2019s going to be different than what you have (in) a bipartisan agreement, but the only way we\u2019re going to get something done is with a bipartisan agreement.\u201d CNN\u2019s Jessica Yellin, Gregory Wallace, Kevin Bohn, Juan Carlos Lopez, Ashley Killough and Dana Bash contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Angus King, an independent, was elected to the Senate from Maine last year King caucuses with Democrats, but hopes to be a bridge between the two parties King bemoans the decline of centrism and compromise in politics King's personal hero is Civil War leader Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain Angus King knows a thing or two about deep political divides. Raised near the shadow of Robert E. Lee\u2019s Virginia home, Maine\u2019s freshman senator today lives down the street from the house once owned by Joshua Lawrence Chamberlain, the Union hero who oversaw the formal surrender of Lee\u2019s army at Appomattox. Chamberlain ordered his men \u201cto salute the Confederate soldiers as they were surrendering their arms,\u201d King told an audience in 2009.  \u201cThis was an unbelievably controversial act (but) it was the right thing to do. \u2026 (It) helped profoundly to repair the breach of the Civil War.\u201d Chamberlain \u201cis my hero,\u201d King told CNN in a recent interview on Capitol Hill.  A bust of the colonel greets visitors to King\u2019s Senate office.  A depiction of Chamberlain\u2019s desperate defense of Little Round Top at the Battle of Gettysburg hangs on the wall. Career in government: Governor of Maine, 1994-2002; aide to Maine Sen. William Hathaway, chief counsel to U.S. Senate Subcommittee on Alcoholism and Narcotics, 1972-1975.Professional career: Founded Northeast Energy Management, Inc., energy conservation project developer, 1989-1994; general counsel and VP, Swift River/Hafslund Co., 1983-1988; host, MaineWatch on Maine public television, 1975-1993; attorney, Smith, Lloyd and King, 1975-1983; staff attorney, Pine Tree Legal Assistance, 1969-1972.Born: March 31, 1944, in Alexandria, VirginiaEducation: B.A., Dartmouth College, 1966; law degree, University of Virginia, 1969Family: Married to Mary Herman; four sons and one daughter; five grandchildren In today\u2019s harshly polarized political climate, King, 68, is the rarest breed of Washington politician \u2013 an independent, beholden to neither political party.  A popular former two-term governor, he was swept into the Senate last November in a landslide. He now occupies the seat previously held by Olympia Snowe, who surprisingly announced her retirement in early 2012.  Snowe also was a rarity in national politics, a genuinely moderate Republican in an age of growing tea party turmoil. King caucuses with Democrats. While aligning with one of the two parties is necessary to obtain valuable committee assignments and protect his state\u2019s interests, the political maverick insists he will not be in \u201cautomatic opposition\u201d to either party. \u201cBeing fiercely independent doesn\u2019t mean you have to be fierce,\u201d he declared on election night. The goal is \u201cto be a bridge between my new colleagues on either side of the aisle, to bring people and our country closer to that more perfect union envisioned by our founders.\u201d Senator questions drone killings Building SOTU expecatations Sen. King: Working together in Congress King told jubilant supporters that his election \u201cand the message it sends can make a difference in the poisonous atmosphere of American politics today.\u201d So roughly 40 days into his term, is the atmosphere on the Potomac as poisonous as he expected? \u201cI don\u2019t think so,\u201d he told CNN.  \u201cOr at least not so far. I think maybe that\u2019s the best way to put it. \u2026 There are some glimmers of light.\u201d Filibuster deal a glimmer of hope One glimmer was the recent bipartisan negotiation over filibuster reform \u2013 an attempt to get the Senate\u2019s legislative gears turning again by reducing the number of procedural roadblocks and showdowns requiring 60-vote supermajorities. While the relatively small changes enacted were \u201cnot as extensive as I would have liked, (they were) the result of bipartisan discussion, listening and compromise,\u201d King said.  \u201cThat\u2019s what we want.\u201d King is optimistic about immigration reform.  The contentious issue rocketed up the GOP\u2019s priority list in the wake of Mitt Romney\u2019s dismal showing among Hispanic voters last fall, and President Barack Obama renewed his push on the issue in the State of the Union address. A \u201cbipartisan group of senators (is) talking about immigration \u2026 and (considering) a pretty substantive package,\u201d King said.  These are \u201cnot just vague goals but pretty clear steps.  So those are positive signs.\u201d King says he\u2019s now met individually with about 40 senators from both parties, and hasn\u2019t met anyone who fits \u201cthe pompous, pretentious, condescending movie image of the senator who talks in platitudes.\u201d \u201cWhat I\u2019ve met are a lot of people who come from a variety of walks of life, who are here because they want to solve problems. They (just) have different views of how to do it.\u201d As for his relationship with Senate GOP leaders since caucusing with the Democrats, King insists he\u2019s been \u201cwarmly received.\u201d \u201cAll I can tell you is impressions,\u201d he cautioned.  \u201cWe\u2019re not blood brothers, but \u2026 I\u2019m being treated with respect and with a degree of cordiality.\u201d In meeting with several Republicans, \u201cthey\u2019re finding I\u2019m not exactly the guy they thought I was,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cFor example, (when) we\u2019re talking about regulation and I express my skepticism about overregulation and my desire to minimize and streamline regulation, you can almost see them say, \u2018hmm, this isn\u2019t what I thought.\u2019\u201d Like most people in Congress, King is frustrated by what he describes as the self-inflicted wound of the looming budget sequester. The sequester is Washington-speak for nearly $1 trillion in new spending cuts across government agencies. The Pentagon will account for about half the savings, which would total roughly $85 billion this year alone. They are set to take effect on March 1 absent an agreement in Congress to defer or avert them entirely. King blasted the process that led to sequester \u2013 specifically the failure of a 2011 congressional super committee to agree on a more reasonably designed deficit-reduction package. The sequester cuts were \u201csupposed to be the sword of Damocles over the super committee and the super committee failed to reach a consensus. So here we are,\u201d King said.  \u201cWe\u2019re like Wile E. Coyote, where we throw the anvil off the cliff, run to the bottom, and then act surprised when it hits us on the head.\u201d Sequester a \u2018self-inflicted crisis\u2019 This \u201cis a totally self-inflicted crisis,\u201d he noted.  \u201cThere\u2019s nothing magic about March 1. There\u2019s no credit default or immediate impact or anything.  It\u2019s a totally arbitrary date and it just makes no sense. \u2026 We\u2019re in a very fragile recovery right now, and to suddenly slam the breaks on a significant hunk of federal spending could very easily tip us back into some kind of recession.\u201d King supports gradual deficit reduction efforts, but warns that both parties\u2019 sacred cows have to be on the table.  For Republicans, that means higher taxes. For Democrats, Medicare and Medicaid. \u201cThe sequester hits the two areas of the budget (defense and non-defense discretionary spending) that are in pretty decent control,\u201d he insisted.  \u201cThe conventional wisdom that the federal government is out of control and spending is out of control (in these areas) just isn\u2019t accurate in terms of the numbers.\u201d Unlike a lot of congressional freshmen, King isn\u2019t a Washington novice.  His first stint on Capitol Hill came in the 1970s as an aide to William Hathaway, then a Democratic senator from Maine. Asked what\u2019s changed the most since, King cited the sharp rise in partisanship as more conservatives became Republicans and more liberals became Democrats. \u201cWhen I was here in the \u201970s there was a swath of ideological views from the right to the left.  But it wasn\u2019t necessarily strictly according to party,\u201d he said. \u201cOne of the most conservative people in the Congress was John Stennis of Mississippi.  He was a Democrat.  One of the most liberal people in the Congress was Jacob Javits of New York, a Republican.  So there was a lot of overlap, and there was a lot more willingness to sit down and try to find bipartisan solutions.\u201d King remembers sitting in closed committee sessions and seeing legislative giants \u201cargue and disagree and say \u2018that won\u2019t work\u2019 or \u2018this won\u2019t work.\u2019  But ultimately they found some kind of consensus and moved on.\u201d \u201cI was here two and a half years and I don\u2019t remember a single filibuster on anything,\u201d he said. Today, Maine still has ideological diversity across the political spectrum. King\u2019s home state colleague is moderate Republican Susan Collins, but that\u2019s the exception to the increasingly ironclad rule. What happened to the liberal Republicans and conservative Democrats?  Why did they disappear? King cites three factors: Increasingly precise gerrymandering of congressional districts, the fragmentation and balkanization of the news media, and an explosion of special interest money due partly to court rulings like Citizens United. \u201cBoth parties, but particularly the Republicans, have sort of pulled back toward their base,\u201d King noted. \u201cThe Republicans have practically no moderates left.  And 25, 30 years ago the Senate was full of them. \u2026 That\u2019s a recipe for confrontation.  You add all those things together and it has created a much more partisan atmosphere.\u201d Trailblazing Maine senator another hero Next to the depiction of Chamberlain\u2019s Gettysburg heroics hanging in King\u2019s office, there is a black and white picture of Margaret Chase Smith. Smith, a trailblazing Maine Republican who served in Senate from 1949 to 1973, was the first woman to have her name in placed in nomination for president at a major party\u2019s political convention. She also led the charge against fellow Republican Joe McCarthy with her \u201cDeclaration of Conscience\u201d speech on the Senate floor in 1950. \u201cShe was no liberal, but she was certainly an independent thinker,\u201d King said. \u201cI think she would chafe at the expectation of partisanship.  She was a bit of a maverick (and) was never one of the good old boys. \u2026 She had no trouble standing on her hind legs and calling them as she saw them.\u201d While King draws inspiration from the memory of Smith and other Maine political giants, he also turns to religion. A lifelong Episcopalian, he attends church regularly. \u201cI believe in a God who is engaged with the world but that we are individuals of free will who carry out his will,\u201d King said. \u201cIt\u2019s a paradox.\u201d Faith is \u201ca source of strength and perseverance under difficult circumstances,\u201d he added.  \u201cI want to live my faith and reflect it in my work, but I view it as personal guidance for me, not how other people should act.\u201d But it\u2019s the story of Chamberlain that may resonate most deeply in terms of King\u2019s independent political career.  A four-term governor, president of Bowdoin College, and eventual Medal of Honor winner, Chamberlain fell out of favor with Maine\u2019s political establishment. King notes that local Republicans turned on Chamberlain with a vengeance for failing to support the impeachment of President Andrew Johnson \u2013 a stance which probably cost the Civil War hero a U.S. Senate seat. \u201cHe was deemed too independent,\u201d King said. Chamberlain instead ended his career as surveyor of the port of Portland. The lesson of Chamberlain\u2019s life?  That\u2019s an easy one. \u201cDo the right thing,\u201d King said.  \u201cAnd don\u2019t be afraid to charge every now and then.\u201d",

            "article_content": "NEW: Defense Secretary Panetta says political dysfunction threatens security President Obama talks up job creation at a North Carolina plant House Speaker Boehner says the Senate must act first on pending budget cuts The State of the Union address and GOP response portend more political division Keeping up pressure on congressional Republicans after his State of the Union address, President Barack Obama launched three days of campaign-style speeches on Wednesday with a visit to a North Carolina manufacturing plant that he said epitomized his proposals for job creation. Obama toured the Linamar Corporation plant in Asheville before telling workers that Congress should pass his proposals laid out in Tuesday night\u2019s speech that call for more job training and ending tax subsidies that reward sending jobs overseas. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to stop with some of the politics we see in Washington sometimes that focuses on who\u2019s up and who\u2019s down,\u201d he said. In all ways, the president appears to be \u201cup\u201d after a well-received annual address that continued to define the political and ideological divide with Republicans over the role and size of government, as well as how to reduce chronic federal deficits and rising debt. What Obama said Tuesday night Congressional Republicans, meanwhile, seem \u201cdown\u201d as the Washington debate focuses on impending budget cuts mandated by a past agreement with Democrats and the White House to raise the federal debt ceiling. In the GOP response to Obama\u2019s speech at the Capitol, conservative Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida rolled off a now-familiar list of criticisms of the president\u2019s approach while repeatedly referring to Republican proposals rejected by Democrats. For both sides, the messaging sounded similar to last year\u2019s election campaign in which Obama won the White House for a second term and Democrats strengthened their Senate majority while narrowing the GOP advantage in the House. After the November vote, Republicans were forced to concede on one of their most steadfast issues by agreeing to higher tax rates on top income earners as part of a January deal to avoid some of the harshest impacts of the so-called fiscal cliff. The agreement put off action on mandatory budget cuts, which are set to take effect March 1. While Obama has called for averting them with deficit-reduction steps that would include more tax revenue and spending cuts, Republicans reject new tax revenue increases. Pelosi psychoanalyzes Boehner Speaker John Boehner noted Wednesday the House passed bills last year to prevent the cuts \u2013 known in Washington jargon as sequestration \u2013 from affecting the military,  but Senate Democrats never acted. \u201cIt\u2019s time for the Senate to do its job,\u201d he told reporters in criticizing the cuts totaling an estimated $85 billion in 2013 and roughly $1 trillion over the next decade. Obama\u2019s emotional plea might lead to vote on guns Boehner characterized sequestration as a meat ax approach that would reduce military readiness and cause other problems. He was expected to send a letter on Wednesday to all House members telling them to prepare for the impact of cuts, which will force all legislators, committees and administrative offices to slash their budgets. \u201cWe\u2019re prepared to deal with it and I would hope that it wouldn\u2019t happen,\u201d Boehner said. The Pentagon would be expected to absorb about half the cuts, but other agencies are weighing in with their concerns. Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano warned in a letter to a key congressional Democrat that the planned cuts would reduce staffing for border patrol and aviation security as well as disaster response. Outgoing Defense Secretary Leon Panetta said on Wednesday that Congress needs to put aside party and ideological divisions that he called \u201cthe greatest concern I have for our national security.\u201d \u201cWe need to find solutions,\u201d Panetta told his final Pentagon news briefing. \u201cWe can\u2019t just sit here and bitch; we can\u2019t just sit here and complain; we can\u2019t just sit here and blame others; we can\u2019t just sit here and point fingers at each other; we can\u2019t just sit here and try to get sound bytes; we can\u2019t just sit here and try to make points, political points.\u201d Obama and Rubio: How did they do? Differences between parties, politics and ideology will always be part of Congress, the one-time legislator said, adding the legislative branch was fashioned that way to ensure full debate. \u201cBut there are also some lines that are there that make that process work, lines that involve mutual respect, lines that involve, you know, courtesy and a degree of respect for each other, despite whatever their decisions are,\u201d Panetta continued. \u201cAnd you kind of see that breaking down in this process.  It becomes too personal; it becomes too mean.\u201d Asked about how the nation is viewed in the world, Panetta said that despite the acknowledged strength of U.S. military power and values, \u201cthere is a nervousness out there about whether, in fact, ultimately we can rise to the challenge of governing ourselves and finding answers to the tough issues that we\u2019re confronting.\u201d In his State of the Union address, Obama challenged Congress to join him in taking on \u201cour generation\u2019s task\u201d to ignite the growth of a \u201crising, thriving middle class.\u201d He emphasized economic growth and job creation, and insisted his proposals would not increase the deficit, though the White House offered no price tag for his initiatives. When asked Wednesday about the measures Obama touted in Asheville, White House officials said existing funds and savings initiatives in the administration\u2019s upcoming budget proposal would cover the cost. Obama, in his speech on Tuesday, also made an emotional plea for Congress to hold votes on controversial proposals for tougher gun laws after the Newtown, Connecticut, shootings in December that killed 20 schoolchildren. At the same time, Obama called for legislators to work together for the good of the country, saying Americans \u201cexpect us to put the nation\u2019s interests before party.\u201d Five things we learned from the State of the Union In delivering the Republican response, Rubio repeated longstanding GOP criticism of Obama\u2019s proposals as job-killing, growth-stunting bigger government. \u201cPresidents in both parties \u2013 from John F. Kennedy to Ronald Reagan \u2013 have known that our free enterprise economy is the source of our middle-class prosperity,\u201d said Rubio, a tea party favorite considered a rising star in the Republican Party. \u201cBut President Obama?  He believes it\u2019s the cause of our problems.\u201d The night of competing messages showed that despite Obama\u2019s election victory in November, hopes for a more pragmatic political climate appeared unrealistic. Tweets of the Union Rand Paul responds to State of the Union Rand Paul responds to State of the Union Watch the full speech Watch the full speech Virginia focus group reacts to SOTU Virginia focus group reacts to SOTU \u201cIn many ways, what we heard tonight is the same old, same old argument,\u201d noted CNN Chief Political Analyst Gloria Borger. Most viewers have positive reaction Taking aim at the bitter partisanship of his first term, Obama\u2019s State of the Union address included a call to \u201cset party interests aside, and work to pass a budget that replaces reckless cuts with smart savings and wise investments in our future.\u201d \u201cAnd let\u2019s do it without the brinksmanship that stresses consumers and scares off investors,\u201d he continued to applause, mainly from Democrats. \u201cThe greatest nation on Earth cannot keep conducting its business by drifting from one manufactured crisis to the next. We can\u2019t do it. Let\u2019s agree, right here, right now, to keep the people\u2019s government open, and pay our bills on time, and always uphold the full faith and credit of the United States of America.\u201d In a jab at congressional Republicans who seek to shrink deficits and government through spending cuts, he said \u201cdeficit reduction alone is not an economic plan.\u201d Rubio\u2019s response blamed Obama for weakening U.S. stability and potential by continued deficit spending and failing to confront needed reforms to entitlement programs like Social Security and Medicare. \u201cThe real cause of our debt is that our government has been spending $1 trillion more than it takes in every year. That\u2019s why we need a balanced budget amendment,\u201d he said, accusing Obama of wanting to leave Medicare unchanged so that it goes bankrupt. However, Obama called for \u201cmodest\u201d reforms to Medicare in his speech, repeating proposals raised in previous deficit-reduction negotiations but regarded by Republicans as insufficient. CNN Fact Check: Record wind energy Obama also continued his push for Congress to act on politically volatile issues such as immigration reform. Other measures proposed in the speech included a paycheck fairness act intended to make it easier for women to fight salary discrimination without losing their jobs, raising the minimum wage to $9 an hour, developing new alternative energy hubs in the country, and helping people refinance their mortgages at today\u2019s lower interest rates. CNN Fact Check: Gas mileage With former U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, seriously wounded in a 2011 shooting in her home state of Arizona in the House chamber along with families of other victims of gun violence, Obama continued his push for tighter firearms restrictions. He mentioned 15-year-old Hadiya Pendleton, the Chicago girl killed by gun violence after returning home from taking part in inauguration activities in Washington, saying she was shot a mile from his home in the city. The girl\u2019s parents were guests of first lady Michelle Obama at the address. Also attending was former rock star Ted Nugent, a vocal critic of Obama and any efforts to strengthen gun controls. Obama cited the major provisions of his package of gun proposals, including background checks on all firearms sales, a ban on semi-automatic weapons that mimic military weapons, and limiting ammunition magazines to 10 rounds. In the most emotional moment of the speech, he listed people whose lives have been \u201ctorn apart by gun violence.\u201d They included Pendleton\u2019s parents, Giffords, and the families of the Newtown victims. Obama repeatedly insisted \u201cthey deserve a vote\u201d as the audience cheered loudly. CNN Fact Check: Rubio on Obamacare But the powerful National Rifle Association and legislators from both parties oppose key provisions of Obama\u2019s plan. Rubio echoed the NRA position that \u201cunconstitutionally undermining the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding Americans is not the way to\u201d reduce gun violence. Meanwhile, NRA President David Keene conceded there would be votes on some issues, but he accused Obama of playing up the emotional side of the issue to try to force through gun control laws before they can be properly debated. On foreign policy, Obama announced that this time next year, another 34,000 U.S. troops will have returned home from Afghanistan. The move will reduce by more than half the current force level there of 66,000 troops as Afghan forces prepare to take the lead in combat missions.  The plan is for all U.S. combat troops to leave by the end of 2014. Opinion: Obama dares Congress On climate change, Obama promised executive action if Congress failed to address what he called a litany of evidence that the nation and the world face such as more frequent and powerful storms, wildfires and drought. On cybersecurity, Obama signed an order on Tuesday making it easier for private companies controlling critical infrastructure to share information about cyber attacks with the government. In return, the government will share certain information with companies about attacks believed to be occurring or that are about to take place. Congress has failed to pass any of the dozens of bills aimed at meaningfully securing critical infrastructure from cyber attack. Opinion: Democracy talks back Rubio is promoted as the new face of the Republican Party due to his Hispanic heritage and strong communications skills. Obama won overwhelming support from the Latino vote in defeating GOP challenger Mitt Romney in the November election. Rubio is leading an effort by some Republicans to shift party policy on immigration reform by accepting the concept backed by Obama and Democrats that the nation\u2019s estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants should have a path to legal status. However, he neglected to mention specifics of an immigration reform plan in his response Tuesday night.

            "article_content": "NEW: Sen. Marco Rubio reiterates his party's criticism of Obama in the GOP response NEW: Analysts say both sides are pushing old arguments, signaling further division President Obama says of gun violence victims: \"They deserve a vote\" on tougher laws Obama says after the clearing the \"rubble of crisis,\" the state of the union is stronger President Barack Obama challenged Congress to join him in taking on \u201cour generation\u2019s task\u201d to ignite the growth of a \u201crising, thriving middle class,\u201d using the first State of the Union address of his second term to prod Republicans to compromise on the major challenges facing the nation. \u201cIt is our unfinished task to restore the basic bargain that built this country \u2013 the idea that if you work hard and meet your responsibilities, you can get ahead, no matter where you come from, what you look like, or who you love,\u201d Obama said Tuesday night, sounding familiar themes from his re-election campaign last year. The president emphasized economic growth and job creation, and insisted that his proposals would not increase the nation\u2019s deficit, though the White House offered no price tag on his initiatives. He also made an emotional plea for Congress to hold votes on controversial proposals for tougher gun laws after the Newtown, Connecticut, shootings in December that killed 20 schoolchildren. At the same time, Obama called for legislators to work together for the good of the nation, saying Americans \u201cexpect us to put the nation\u2019s interests before party.\u201d Obama: Harvest immigrants' talents Obama: Shooting victims deserve vote Obama pushes equal treatment in military Obama: We must act on climate change \u201cThey do expect us to forge reasonable compromise where we can,\u201d he said. \u201cFor they know that America moves forward only when we do so together, and that the responsibility of improving this union remains the task of us all.\u201d 5 things we learned It was his fourth State of the Union address and seventh speech to a joint sitting of Congress, and analysts considered it a crucial moment for setting the tone for the political dialogue after four years of partisan division and congressional dysfunction. In the Republican response, Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida signaled little acceptance of what Obama proposed, repeating longstanding GOP criticism of what he described as job-killing, growth-snuffing bigger government. \u201cPresidents in both parties \u2013 from John F. Kennedy to Ronald Reagan \u2013 have known that our free enterprise economy is the source of our middle-class prosperity,\u201d said Rubio, a tea party favorite considered the a rising star in the Republican Party. \u201cBut President Obama?  He believes it\u2019s the cause of our problems.\u201d According to Rubio, the president\u2019s solution \u201cto virtually every problem we face is for Washington to tax more, borrow more and spend more.\u201d CNN Fact Check: Rubio says Obamacare needs a check up With both sides sticking to deeply entrenched positions, the night of competing messages signaled continued partisan division and political showdowns in Washington over the federal budget and further steps to reduce the deficit and national debt. \u201cIn many ways, what we heard tonight is the same old, same old argument,\u201d noted CNN Chief Political Analyst Gloria Borger. Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich told CNN that Rubio helped himself as a Republican leader, while Jennifer Granholm, the former Democratic governor of Michigan, accused the Florida senator of missing an opportunity to appeal to the political center because he overstated GOP talking points. To CNN Senior Political Analyst David Gergen, Rubio emerged as an attractive figure on the American political stage but was short on specifics. Opinion: Obama dares Congress to get the job done \u201cI don\u2019t think they won the arguments tonight,\u201d Gergen said of Republicans. The government faces deep spending cuts mandated by a previous agreement between Obama and Congress to raise the federal debt ceiling, and Obama renewed his call on Tuesday night for a comprehensive deficit-reduction plan that includes new tax revenue coupled with spending cuts. Taking aim at the bitter partisanship of his first term, Obama said \u201clet\u2019s set party interests aside, and work to pass a budget that replaces reckless cuts with smart savings and wise investments in our future.\u201d \u201cAnd let\u2019s do it without the brinksmanship that stresses consumers and scares off investors,\u201d he continued to applause, mainly from Democrats. \u201cThe greatest nation on Earth cannot keep conducting its business by drifting from one manufactured crisis to the next. We can\u2019t do it. Let\u2019s agree, right here, right now, to keep the people\u2019s government open, and pay our bills on time, and always uphold the full faith and credit of the United States of America.\u201d Rubio: I care for the middle class Rand Paul responds to State of the Union CNN Explains: The State of the Union In a jab at congressional Republicans who seek to shrink deficits and the size of government through deep spending cuts, saying \u201cdeficit reduction alone is not an economic plan.\u201d Rubio\u2019s response blamed Obama for weakening U.S. stability and potential by continued deficit spending and failing to take on needed reforms to entitlement programs such as Social Security and Medicare. \u201cThe real cause of our debt is that our government has been spending $1 trillion more than it takes in every year. That\u2019s why we need a balanced budget amendment,\u201d he said, accusing Obama of wanting to leave Medicare unchanged so that it goes bankrupt. Opinion: In 2013, democracy talks back about State of the Union However, Obama called for \u201cmodest\u201d reforms to Medicare in his speech, repeating proposals already raised in previous deficit-reduction negotiations that Republicans consider insufficient. After arriving to loud cheers and prolonged applause on a night of political pomp and ceremony, Obama began the speech on a positive note, saying the nation was on sound footing to move forward. \u201cTogether, we have cleared away the rubble of crisis, and can say with renewed confidence that the state of our union is stronger,\u201d he said. The president continued his push for Congress to act on politically volatile issues such as immigration reform. Other measures in the speech included a paycheck fairness act intended to make it easier for women to fight salary discrimination without losing their jobs, and new proposals to develop alternative energy hubs in the country, and help people refinance their mortgages at today\u2019s lower interest rates. Headlines of the day also influenced the speech. CNN Fact Check: Illegal border crossings at lowest levels in 40 years Obama mentioned North Korea\u2019s latest underground nuclear test, which the State Department labeled \u201cprovocative\u201d and \u201cextremely regrettable.\u201d With victims of gun violence in the audience at the Capitol, including former U.S. Rep. Gabrielle Giffords, Obama continued his push for tighter gun laws opposed by the influential National Rifle Association and legislators from both parties. He mentioned 15-year-old Hadiya Pendleton, the Chicago girl killed by gun violence after returning home from taking part in inauguration activities in Washington, saying she was shot a mile from his home in the city. The girl\u2019s parents were guests of first lady Michelle Obama at the address. Also attending was former rock star Ted Nugent, a vocal critic of Obama and any efforts to strengthen gun controls in America. Obama cited the major provisions of his package of gun proposals, including background checks on all gun sales, a ban on semi-automatic weapons that mimic military weapons, and limiting ammunition magazines to 10 rounds. Listing gun violence victims \u2013 Hadiya\u2019s parents, Giffords, the families of the Newtown schoolchildren and others killed in mass shootings, Obama said \u201cthey deserve a vote\u201d as the audience cheered loudly. In his response, Rubio sounded the NRA line that \u201cunconstitutionally undermining the Second Amendment rights of law-abiding Americans is not the way to\u201d reduce gun violence in the country. On foreign policy, Obama announced that this time next year, another 34,000 U.S. troops will have returned home from Afghanistan. The move will reduce by more than half the current force level of 66,000 troops in Afghanistan. Obama and NATO previously announced that Afghan forces will take the lead in combat missions this year. By the end of 2014, the planned official end of the combat mission, the White House is considering a range of troop levels for Afghanistan, from as many as 15,000 down to zero. One thing Obama didn\u2019t mention Tuesday night was new regulations on carbon emissions for existing power plants a senior administration official said. Environmentalists hoped the president\u2019s pledge in his recent inaugural address for increased steps in response to climate change would include expanding tougher standards in place for new power plants to those already in existence. CNN Fact Check: Wind energy breezes into the record books At the same time, the president promised executive action on climate change if Congress fails to address what he called a litany of evidence that the nation and the world face increasing impacts such as more frequent and powerful storms, wildfires and drought. One new measure from the president will be an executive order signed Tuesday to address the country\u2019s most basic cybersecurity needs. The order will make it easier for private companies in control of our nation\u2019s critical infrastructure to share information about cyber attacks with the government. In return, the Department of Homeland Security will share \u201csanitized\u201d classified information with companies about attacks believed to be occurring or that are about to take place. Congress has failed so far to pass any of the dozens of cybersecurity bills aimed at meaningfully securing critical infrastructure from an online criminals. CNN Fact Check: Obama on fuel economy \u2013 your mileage may vary Rubio is a tea party favorite being promoted as the new face of the Republican Party due to his Hispanic heritage and strong communications skills. Obama won overwhelming support from the Latino vote in defeating GOP challenger Mitt Romney in the November election. Rubio is leading an effort by some Republicans to shift party policy on immigration reform by accepting the concept backed by Obama and Democrats that the nation\u2019s estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants should have a path to legal status. However, he neglected to mention specifics of an immigration reform plan in his response Tuesday night. When Obama raised the immigration issue in his speech, a bipartisan group of senators, including Republican John McCain of Arizona and Democrat Chuck Schumer of New York, stood and applauded together to signal bipartisan support for moving forward. In addition to Rubio, Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky offered a second Republican response that reflected the concerns of tea party conservatives who support him. Paul criticized Obama and Congress for failing to seriously address the federal deficit and national debt. CNN\u2019s Jim Acosta, Kevin Liptak, Rachel Streitfeld, Ashley Killough and Mark Preston contributed to this report.",

Newcomers to Congress say they are willing to work with the president if he reaches out more They were elected in 2010 as House saw a shift to the right Said one GOP congressman: 'I think what he would find is we are not nearly as intransigent' As President Obama prepares to lay out an agenda Tuesday night, three congressional foes say his challenge might be a lot easier if he spent a little more time schmoozing. \u201cI think it would make a difference from this standpoint: It is easier to understand where someone is coming from when you have a relationship with him,\u201d said Rep. Trey Gowdy, R-South Carolina. Forgive the White House if the administration is surprised to hear that from a legislator who last month sent out a press release declaring \u201cObama Violates the Constitution\u201d in reference to a decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals. By the numbers: State of the Union Was Boehner right to offer compromise? Is GOP struggle communication or policy? Lessons for Congress from 'Lincoln' But in a wide-ranging discussion with CNN chief congressional correspondent Dana Bash, three members of the conservative Republican wave first elected in 2010 \u2013 Gowdy, Rep. Adam Kinzinger of Illinois and Rep. Kristi Noem of South Dakota \u2013 insisted they\u2019d like to find some issues to work on with the president and said Obama could make compromise more realistic by reaching out. \u201cIt\u2019s harder to demagogue people,\u201d if you have a personal relationship, Gowdy said. \u201cAnd I think what he would find is we are not nearly as intransigent, and whatever other negative word you want to use. We\u2019re trying our best to represent our districts.\u201d The legislators agreed that, aside from one or two receptions at the White House, they had not had any dealings with the Obama administration. \u201cWe have a representative from the White House that is supposed to come meet with my office a lot, a staff member,\u201d Kinzinger said. \u201cHaven\u2019t heard from him in probably \u2013 actually since the day I got sworn in, two years ago.\u201d Gowdy and Noem seemed surprised to hear about the White House representative. \u201cI didn\u2019t know we had one,\u201d Gowdy said. Five things to watch The three representatives all came to Washington in 2010, when voters dealt Obama an electoral blow by giving Republicans a majority in the House. Two years later, the 2010 Congress was criticized for accomplishing little and spurning leaders\u2019 attempts to bring both sides to agreement. Noem said the job came with frustrations. \u201cTo come here and see how slow the process is was a big challenge for me. I like to get things done,\u201d she said. \u201cBut also, even though there are members here that I disagree with, they are elected by people at home who they think are doing their jobs.\u201d Gowdy said he was committed to certain principles and was representing the voters who elected him, not being an obstructionist. \u201cWhat one person would define as obstructionism, another person would define as principle,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have one-half of the third of the government \u2026 so my job is to stick to my principles, to listen to the other side and find common ground, if you can.\u201d Rep. Cartwright: 'Optimism' key in SOTU CNN Explains: The State of the Union \u201cI got 65% of the votes\u201d in a re-election bid, Gowdy said. \u201cSo the people I worked for are either content with the job I\u2019m doing, or they can\u2019t find a better alternative, one or the other.\u201d He and his colleagues mentioned areas where they might be able to work with the president: on taxes, immigration or entitlement reform. And the trio of Obama critics argued that despite past clashes with the White House, the president could kick start some legislative action by reaching out in Tuesday\u2019s State of the Union address. Kinzinger said he hopes the address is markedly different than another big speech Obama delivered last month. \u201cWe all sat 30 yards away from the president at the inauguration. And I for one was actually hoping he\u2019d talk about big ideas, about how do we reduce the deficit,\u201d Kinzinger said. \u201cInstead it was a partisan speech, and I thought he really missed an opportunity. And I hope I can say he took that opportunity in the State of the Union.\u201d Gowdy cautioned that Obama\u2019s State of the Union address would set the tone for the coming years. \u201cWe\u2019ll find out during the State of the Union whether or not this is a campaign to retake the House in two years, or whether it\u2019s a campaign to govern for four years,\u201d he said.",

First-term Florida senator will deliver Republican response to Obama's address Rubio has become a leader in GOP immigration reform initiative Analysts say Rubio's efforts could help Republicans win over Latinos Senator's youth could also help attract younger generation to GOP Sen. Marco Rubio\u2019s selection to speak right after the president\u2019s State of the Union address marks another milestone in the swift rise of the political star. Rubio became Florida\u2019s speaker of the House at just 35, he pulled off an upset victory over Gov. Charlie Crist in the U.S. Senate race in 2010, he was seen prominently campaigning with GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney last year, and he is already talked about as a future contender for the presidency. Friends attribute his speedy ascent not only to his personal appeal, but also to out-hustling the competition and being in the right place at the right time. This year, with the immigration issue becoming a priority in Washington, he is a sought-after voice, thanks to his personal story as the son of Cuban immigrants. He also gives Republicans a fresh face to appeal to new audiences \u2013 especially to younger and Hispanic voters, both of which the GOP once again failed to win over in the last election. Time magazine dubbed Rubio \u201cThe Republican Savior\u201d on its cover and in a lengthy profile. (His modest response, via tweet: \u201cThere is only one savior, and it is not me. #jesus\u201d) Rubio: I\u2019m no savior And now, the prime speaking slot he was selected for is adding to his cachet as an up-and-comer. Rubio to deliver GOP State of the Union response Rubio to deliver bilingual GOP response Panel questions proposals of WH, Rubio Sen. Nelson: 'Give Rubio a break' \u201cMarco Rubio is one of our party\u2019s most dynamic and inspiring leaders,\u201d House Speaker John Boehner said last week. But even for a politician known for being a good speaker, being awarded the State of the Union role is not without its pitfalls. While President Barack Obama\u2019s address has the benefit of a live audience and an imposing setting, the rebuttal, with no audience and no grandeur, can look small by comparison. Rubio will have to compete with the tea party response from Sen. Rand Paul. And Obama can be a tough act to follow \u2013 just ask Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal, who got low marks for his speech in 2009. A tough gig \u201cIt is the toughest gig in politics, to follow a State of the Union with all the pomp and circumstance,\u201d says Rubio friend and CNN contributor Ana Navarro. \u201cYou\u2019re following the president of the United States who just got a number of standing ovations.\u201d But regardless of how Tuesday night goes, Rubio has already moved front and center this year on the immigration debate. At a bipartisan press conference last month outlining a set of opening principles, he served as the Republican pitch man \u2013 in English and Spanish \u2013 and he capitalized on his own Cuban roots. \u201cI live surrounded by immigrants. My neighbors are immigrants,\u201d he said. \u201cI see the good of immigration. I see how important it is for our future.\u201d But while Rubio\u2019s efforts on the issue have won praise from party leaders like Boehner and House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, they have also earned him the ire of conservatives who consider the path to citizenship a capitulation tantamount to amnesty. An editorial in The National Review said, \u201cHe is wrong about how to go about repairing our immigration system,\u201d because he is acquiescing to an \u201camnesty-and-enforcement bill.\u201d Conversely, just because Rubio is Hispanic does not mean he is immune to criticism from Hispanics, whether on immigration or on other topics like spending cuts. For example, at a protest last year, where signs said \u201cno somos Rubios,\u201d one protester told CNN affiliate WSVN, \u201cWe feel the senator is not listening to the people.\u201d It\u2019s a big risk for Rubio to take a central role in the coming immigration fight, says Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, R-Florida, a fellow Cuban-American. \u201cBut thank goodness for our party that he is willing to take that risk.\u201d Analysts say Rubio\u2019s efforts on immigration could help Republicans appeal to Latino voters. CNN Explains: The State of the Union State of your union Obama to make State of the Union case \u201cThey feel like the Republican Party hates them,\u201d veteran political strategist and analyst Dick Morris told CNN\u2019s Piers Morgan. \u201cThe Rubio bill has got to pass for Republicans ever to access that vote.\u201d A product of exile community Marco Antonio Rubio grew up in the exile community of West Miami, raised by parents who came from Cuba in the 1950s. He had long described himself as the son of political exiles who fled the Castro regime, but biographer Manuel Roig-Franzia of the Washington Post discovered that in fact his parents had left Cuba before Castro even came to power. Rubio conceded the error, but rejected the suggestion that the revelation diminished his family\u2019s status as political exiles, or that he had embellished his family history. \u201cDo I wish I had known those dates earlier? Absolutely,\u201d he said. \u201cDoes it change anything? Absolutely not.\u201d Rubio obtained his first job in politics while he was still a University of Miami student: an internship with Ros-Lehtinen. She said Rubio impressed her as hard-working, well-spoken and eager to please. Even though he was just an intern, he would talk to voters and work the room on her behalf at events. \u201cHe was a real people-person. He was not just hanging right by my side; he was doing his own networking for me, getting business cards,\u201d she said. \u201cHe just had standout qualities from day one.\u201d A few years later, Rubio was running for commissioner in West Miami at age 26. Rebeca Sosa, who was a commissioner at the time, said she was gardening at her house when he came to her asking for support and spelled out why he was running for office. \u201cI wasn\u2019t prepared to see such a young person bringing so much meaning, emotion to his answer of why, that I stopped everything I was doing and I told him, \u2018Let\u2019s go and have coffee,\u2019\u201d she said. \u201cAt that age, usually they are thinking about \u2018party,\u2019 they are thinking about \u2018girlfriend;\u2019 and he was thinking about, \u2018What can I do to pay back to society?\u2019\u201d Rubio soon got elected to the Florida House of Representatives and within just a few years his colleagues gave him a term as their leader: Speaker of the House. Taking a steeper path Sperling: Economy fix not about new fads Rep. Cartwright: 'Optimism' key in SOTU Checking Obama's 2012 Union vows But his next decision \u2013 to run for Senate \u2013 was not the obvious path, since it meant a daunting primary challenge to a popular governor in his own party. \u201cEarly on, the entire establishment was against Marco,\u201d said campaign manager Jose Mallea. \u201cThere were some tough times when you couldn\u2019t raise money or when folks weren\u2019t endorsing you.\u201d Rubio painted Crist as a centrist and appealed to conservatives and tea party voters with his focus on economic opportunity, government spending and the debt. But Crist had statewide name recognition and a strong fund raising base. And Rubio was not without weaknesses, including his youthful appearance and questions about his use of a Republican Party credit card for personal expenses. Rubio blamed the misuse of funds on a mix up and said he reimbursed the party. But Crist reminded voters in a campaign ad that Rubio was being investigated \u201cfor using a Republican Party credit card to pay for flights and meals.\u201d In his book \u201cAmerican Son,\u201d Rubio said he considered dropping out of the race early on. \u201cThe only people who thought I could win all live in my house,\u201d Rubio recounted in a speech last summer. \u201cFour of them were under the age of 10,\u201d he said, referring to his four children. But his wife persuaded him to persevere, and he won a surprise victory. His wife, Jeanette Dousdebes, a one-time Miami Dolphins cheerleader, keeps a low profile compared to other political spouses. In a rare interview last year, she told Politico what she thinks of making campaign appearances: \u201cIn the future, if I have to do it, of course I\u2019ll do it. But in general, I am shy.\u201d Rubio first spotted her at the local recreation center in West Miami just a few blocks from the modest house he grew up in (and a few blocks from where he lives now). He proposed to her on Valentine\u2019s Day 1997 at the top of the Empire State Building. In the Senate, Rubio has several characteristics that set him apart from most of his Republican colleagues. Unlike most of his colleagues, Rubio is not a wealthy man. He did not grow up with money and soon after he was elected to the Florida legislature he had to give up his car and move into his mother-in-law\u2019s house. He still owed significant debt on his student loans when he was elected to the Senate, although thanks to the royalties from his book, he has now paid them off. Not exactly an NFL prospect After high school, Rubio earned a football scholarship to a college in Missouri, playing cornerback. He soon transferred back to Florida as the school ran into financial difficulties, and he admits he was never destined to be NFL material. Instead, he jokes about how ironic it is that his wife made it to the NFL but he didn\u2019t come close. Still, when former Miami Dolphins quarterback Dan Marino threw him a few passes on the floor of the Florida House in 2006, with a crowd watching, Rubio showed his stuff \u2013 first making an easy catch, but then also some harder ones. He is younger than all the other senators, except Mike Lee of Utah, who is a week younger, so he may be mistaken for a junior aide in Capitol elevators. But he also may have a better sense of younger generations than most of his colleagues. For example, in a recent interview posted on BuzzFeed, the senator offered a detailed discourse on rap and hip-hop. At the risk of offending some of his audience, he compared two top rappers from the 1990s by declaring, \u201cTupac\u2019s lyrics were more insightful \u2013 apologies to Biggie fans.\u201d Asked by GQ to name his favorite rap songs, he listed  \u201cStraight Outta Compton\u201d by N.W.A., \u201cKilluminati\u201d by Tupac, and Eminem\u2019s \u201cLose Yourself.\u201d Rubio raps on Tupac, Pitbull and Bob Dole But when it comes to religion, he describes himself as a traditional Catholic \u2013 albeit one who also was baptized Mormon when his family converted for a few years while living in Las Vegas. More recently, he has supplemented Catholic Masses by also attending services at a Baptist church in Miami, according to his office. As soon as he won his Senate race, Rubio drew speculation about potential presidential aspirations and immediate comparisons to Barack Obama. Like Barack Obama, Marco Rubio is young and well-spoken, comes from an ethnic minority and has only a few years of experience in the Senate. In addition, he came to Washington after serving in his state legislature, as did Obama, and he benefited greatly from a high-profile speaking role at his party\u2019s convention in 2012 \u2013 as Obama did in 2004. But Rubio has not been shy about his critique of the president, especially while he was campaigning for Romney last year. \u201cHe is a bad president,\u201d Rubio said bluntly in his speech at the Republican National Convention in Florida last summer. \u201cUnder Barack Obama, the only change is that hope is hard to find.\u201d Observers expect no less from his speech on Tuesday night. Supporters in his hometown of West Miami will be watching closely. Rebeca Sosa is organizing a Rubio watching party at the same rec center where he first saw his future wife. A few blocks away on the main drag of West Miami, an older man is holding a sign in front of Versailles Restaurant as the cars pass by on 8th Street. \u201cMarco Rubio for president 2016,\u201d it says.",

Follow online at CNN.com or via CNN\u2019s apps for iPhone, iPad and Android.  Follow our real-time State of the Union live blog at cnn.com/conversation. President Obama to give his first State of the Union address of his second term on Tuesday On the eve of speech, gridlock in Washington continues to be the biggest obstacle He is expected to lay out an agenda focusing on the economy, guns, immigration Looking at other two-term presidents, this next year will be crucial to get things done It is the second big speech of his presidency\u2019s second act, but there is little or nothing to suggest President Barack Obama\u2019s State of the Union Address offers any hope of a new beginning or a new spirit in divided Washington. Consider the vast partisan differences in expectations. \u201cObama core supporters are getting what they hoped for in 2009,\u201d says veteran Democratic pollster and strategist Peter Hart. \u201cHe is a president who seems both more confident and at the same time at home with himself both legislatively and philosophically.\u201d If there is one certainty in today\u2019s political climate, it is that when one party is happy, the other is not. Security Clearance: Foreign policy will take back seat Politics panel reviews SOTU expectations Paul brews up SOTU response CNN Explains: The State of the Union State of your union \u201cRepublicans should wear asbestos suits to the House chamber because they\u2019re going to be torched,\u201d said longtime GOP operative Ed Gillespie, a veteran of senior jobs in the House leadership, the Republican National Committee and the George W. Bush White House. \u201cPresident Obama seems to think that the best way to get things done is not by retail persuasion but by wholesale attacking.\u201d The president\u2019s wish list already has him on a collision course with the GOP on several fronts, from the familiar sniping over taxes and spending and red ink to new battle lines over White House calls for sweeping changes to immigration and gun laws. Veterans of previous administration note the first year of the second term is critical. \u201cOf his second term, this is the one that will get the most attention,\u201d said Karen Hughes, the George W. Bush confidante. \u201cThis is the list of what he still wants to accomplish as president.\u201d As such, Hughes said, the biggest challenge is focus. \u201cIt was never my favorite speech because it is a legislative laundry list and everyone is trying to get their piece in,\u201d Hughes said. Huge challenge: How will we reduce the deficit? The biggest immediate challenge is a carryover from the first term: Navigating differences over how to achieve a substantial deficit reduction package. A March 1 deadline looms when temporary fixes enacted in the first term essentially expire and across-the-board spending cuts known as sequestration loom if no new plan is passed. \u201cThe economy still languishes and the obvious threat is sequestration, which is omnipresent,\u201d is how Hart described the moment to CNN. \u201cBut I think the president can look presidential and put the GOP between a rock and a hard place.\u201d There is little doubt that the president has the upper hand in the battle for public opinion: what he calls a \u201cbalanced approach\u201d of more tax revenues and spending cuts including, again in the president\u2019s words, \u201cmodest\u201d savings in Medicare and Social Security. \u201cI am prepared, eager and anxious to get a big deal, a big package that ends governance by crisis,\u201d the president told House Democrats this week in offering a bit of a State of the Union preview. But there is no hint of any big deal in sight, and the president himself has called for another temporary fix to push the deadline back a few months. It is a glaring example of Washington dysfunction, and the longer the stalemate goes on, the more extremes in both parties try to block the path to any grand bargain. Conservative groups, for example, warn of retribution against Republicans who consider giving the president any additional tax revenues, and liberal groups repeatedly are reminding newly elected Democrats of their promises not to support Medicare cuts. As this plays out, again, White House aides talk confidently of the president\u2019s place in the political debate. But even in \u201cwinning,\u201d there could be a price. A crisis of confidence GOP pollster Bill McInturff notes a post-election drop in consumer confidence and says there are parallels to past battles over the debt ceiling and the fiscal cliff. In a consumer-driven economy, a collapse in confidence because of more Washington paralysis could stall an economic recovery that is critical to the president\u2019s second term political standing. \u201cEconomic confidence plays a key role in building the type of optimism that encourages businesses to hire and people to spend,\u201d McInturff writes in a presentation offering his take on what he labels \u201cThe Washington Economy.\u201d \u201cIt is important leaders in both parties begin to recognize how the tenor, tone and outcome of the policy debates in Washington are actually retarding economic confidence in a way that makes building a sustained recovery more difficult.\u201d What about immigration and gun laws? Question marks also can be attached to other top State of the Union priorities. Some congressional action on immigration and gun laws seems likely, though what emerges could be significantly less than what Obama wants. Immigration is the most likely source of a major package. But it remains a highly divisive issue, and both parties will be tested. The biggest question mark, perhaps, is whether the Republican-controlled House would pass legislation granting a path to citizenship to the estimated 11 million illegal immigrants in the United States. And if the House passed legislation granting legal status but not full citizenship to such immigrants, would the president accept that compromise? There is little question the president won\u2019t get his way in the gun control debate. He wants new universal background checks for gun purchases. More robust background checks do appear to have significant bipartisan support, but not as sweeping a plan as envisioned by the president. At the moment, the math is against the president when counting votes in Congress for his proposals to ban assault weapons and magazine cartridges that hold more than 10 rounds. On guns, Democrat Hart sees it this way: \u201cThe president has the moral high ground but not necessarily the political high ground. It is still an intensity issue.\u201d Republican Hughes recalls how President George W. Bush later regretted putting a push for Social Security reforms ahead of immigration, an issue that, back then, had better prospects for bipartisan action. Especially now, she says choosing priorities is critical. \u201cIf I were in their shoes, I would be looking to get some things done,\u201d she said. \u201cShow people can work together and restore some confidence.\u201d Hart predicts one line that will win applause across the political spectrum, in living rooms across the country if not in the House chamber: \u201cWe will be out of Afghanistan in 2014. Americans cannot wait for this.\u201d A more aggressive Obama More broadly, he sees a new Obama in the second act even if Washington\u2019s partisan polarization is a sharp as ever. \u201cThere is an aggressiveness to his action and a willingness to recognize that he can use his political strength either to win in policy terms or political terms or maybe both fronts,\u201d Hart said. \u201cBottom line: The wind is at the president\u2019s back. The problems haven\u2019t changed or disappeared, but this is a more confident and politically sharp president right now.\u201d Not surprisingly, Republicans see a different bottom line. \u201cIt\u2019s not likely to produce much by way of legislative accomplishment,\u201d GOP strategist Gillespie said of the president\u2019s second term tone. \u201cI suspect this speech will be in the rear view mirror pretty quickly.\u201d",

            "article_content": "NEW:  President Obama: \"Now's the time\" to move on immigration Sen. Rubio warns Obama against a \"bidding war\" for easier green cards Eight senators, four from each party, have laid out a bipartisan blueprint for reform House legislators are also said to be working on a bipartisan immigration plan President Barack Obama threw his full support behind a comprehensive overhaul of U.S. immigration laws on Tuesday, saying \u201cnow\u2019s the time\u201d to replace a system he called \u201cout of date and badly broken.\u201d The president specified three pillars of immigration reform: better enforcement of immigration laws, providing a path to citizenship for the more than 11 million undocumented immigrants already in the country, and reforming the legal immigration system. Speaking at a majority Hispanic high school in Las Vegas, Obama said \u201ca broad consensus is emerging\u201d behind the issue across the country, with signs of progress in Congress. Mexico \u2018welcomes\u2019 new U.S. immigration reform push However, he acknowledged a fierce debate ahead on an issue he described as emotional and challenging, but vital to economic growth and ensuring equal opportunity for all. \u201cAt this moment, it looks like there\u2019s a genuine desire to get this done soon.  And that\u2019s very encouraging,\u201d Obama said, later adding: \u201cThis time, action must follow. We can\u2019t allow immigration reform to get bogged down in an endless debate.\u201d Obama: Econ needs immigration overhaul Obama: Senators' ideas in line with mine Immigrant family fears being torn apart IL OKs undocumented immigrants' licenses The president spoke a day after eight senators \u2013 four from each party \u2013 introduced a framework for overhauling the immigration system that would provide an eventual path to citizenship for most of the more than 11 million undocumented immigrants in America. While touted as a breakthrough by its drafters, the plan was similar in many aspects to previous immigration reform efforts that have failed in recent years. Obama described the blueprint as a sign of renewed desire by Democrats and Republicans to tackle the issue, saying the plan was \u201cvery much in line with the principles I\u2019ve proposed and campaigned on for the last few years.\u201d Immigration Q&A: Amnesty or path to citizenship? He was criticized by Latino activists for failing to deliver on a 2008 campaign promise to make overhauling immigration policy a priority of his first term. As his re-election campaign heated up last year, the Obama administration announced a halt to deportations of some young undocumented immigrants in a move that delighted the Latino community. Exit polls in November indicated that Latino voters overwhelmingly supported Obama over GOP challenger Mitt Romney, who had advocated a policy that amounted to forcing undocumented immigrants to deport themselves. Obama won Nevada, a battleground state with a large Hispanic population. Obama appeared on Tuesday at Del Sol High School, which has a 54% Hispanic student body, according to U.S. News and World Report rankings. To earn the opportunity for citizenship, Obama said undocumented immigrants must first pass a background check, learn English, pay a penalty, and then get \u201cin the back of the line\u201d behind people trying to come to America legally. Immigration plan: A new era of bipartisanship or a political necessity? Millions of undocumented immigrants would get immediate but provisional status to live and work in the United States, under the compromise plan crafted by the senate group. That outline also called for strengthening border controls, improved monitoring of visitors and cracking down on hiring undocumented workers. Only after those steps occurred could undocumented immigrants already in the country begin the process of getting permanent residence \u2013 green cards \u2013 as a step toward citizenship, the senators said at a news conference on Monday. Before Obama spoke on Tuesday, Republican Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida said any legislation based on the framework he helped draft must include tougher law enforcement sought by conservatives to get his vote. Immigrants\u2019 days filled with fear, uncertainty, separation \u201cWe need border security, we need workplace enforcement, we need a visa tracking system,\u201d Rubio said, adding later that would oppose a bill that lacked language guaranteeing that \u201cnothing else will happen unless these enforcement mechanisms are in place.\u201d Rubio and other senators involved in the bipartisan immigration effort said Monday they plan to provide a bill to the Senate Judiciary Committee in March, with hopes of getting the measure passed over the summer A few hours later, Obama said he would propose his own immigration bill if Congress failed to act on the issue in a timely manner. On the House side, a similar effort on immigration is said to be under way involving a group of Republicans and Democrats. Two senior House Democratic sources briefed on that effort told CNN the group was working to release some sort of outline of its plan soon, possibly as early as this week, but concede \u201cthey are not as far along as the Senate.\u201d By the numbers: Immigration and naturalization Senate lays out blueprint The principles described by Obama on Tuesday were similar to the framework proposed Monday by the eight senators. Conservatives split on reform Other conservatives immediately voiced their opposition to what they called amnesty, a code word on the political right for providing undocumented immigrants a path to legal status. \u201cOur immigration laws aren\u2019t broken, they just aren\u2019t enforced,\u201d argued Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas, after Obama\u2019s speech. \u201d \u2026 We\u2019ve been down this road before with politicians promising to enforce the law in return for amnesty.  And then after the amnesty, they fail to make good on the enforcement promises. The American people should not be fooled. When you legalize those who are in the country illegally, it costs taxpayers millions of dollars, costs American workers thousands of jobs and encourages more illegal immigration.\u201d Republican Sen. Mike Lee of Utah objected to the framework by his Senate colleagues, saying the guidelines \u201ccontemplate a policy that will grant special benefits to undocumented immigrants based on their unlawful presence in the country.\u201d What\u2019s in Senate immigration plan? Rubio rejected such a characterization on Tuesday, saying that the framework would require undocumented immigrants to undergo a background check and face immediate deportation if they committed any serious crimes. Otherwise, they then would have to pay any taxes owed as well as a fine to get what Rubio called \u201cthe equivalent of a non-resident visa that allows you to work here.\u201d An opportunity to get a green card and possible citizenship would only come after the government undertakes other steps, such as increasing border security, he added. Obama, meanwhile, signaled disagreement with Republicans over the state of border security, saying in his speech that the Southwest border was more secure than ever. He mentioned steps to crack down on the hiring of undocumented workers, as well as unclogging the legal immigration system to encourage highly skilled and educated workers already in the country to remain instead of taking their expertise abroad. Democratic senators backing the framework unveiled Monday plan include Chuck Schumer of New York, Dick Durbin of Illinois, Robert Menendez of New Jersey and Michael Bennet of Colorado. On the Republican side were Rubio, John McCain of Arizona, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Jeff Flake of Arizona. Durbin said Tuesday that immigration reform must have bipartisan support to work, so it won\u2019t include everything everyone wants. Path to citizenship: Senators outline bipartisan immigration plan \u201cIt\u2019s going to look different than what I might write, or the president might write,\u201d he said. Like the Senate framework, the House plan will include a path to citizenship, but details of how that will work are still being discussed. The Senate proposal is a good starting point,  Rep. Joe Garcia, D-Florida, said Tuesday on CNN. \u201cI think it puts us in a very good place,\u201d he said. A  litany of left-leaning advocacy groups spoke out on the senators\u2019 plan, praising it as a good first step but cautioning against harming the rights of workers. \u201cThe people of this country are ready for us to be one country again without second-class people being mistreated simply because they lack paper, even though they are already contributing to our economy and our tax system,\u201d NAACP President Ben Jealous said. Opinion: Worker visas are the key to immigration reform AFL-CIO President Richard Trumka told Yahoo News on Tuesday that his labor federation representing 12 million people will mount a \u201cfull-fledged\u201d campaign in support of comprehensive immigration reform. \u201cWe think everybody ought to have the right to work hard and to progress to citizenship,\u201d Trumka said. Meanwhile, U.S. Chamber of Commerce President Tom Donohue has been in talks with Trumka on the issue. He said after Obama\u2019s remarks that American business hoped for changes this year. \u201cWe should seize this opportunity to create an immigration system that serves the interests of our economy, our businesses, and our society,\u201d Donohue said. In a sign of the heated public debate on the issue, a group of about two dozen protesters standing across the street from the Las Vegas high school waved signs opposing amnesty for undocumented immigrants as Obama\u2019s motorcade drove past.

            "article_content": "Immigration plan a product of compromise from senators on both sides Experts say Democrats want a deal and Republicans need a deal But plan may face resistance in House, where conservatives lament path to citizenship There, leaders will need to lure most Democrats and many Republicans to vote for it An immigration proposal crafted for months in secret by a high-profile, bipartisan cadre of senators is both a rare moment of simpatico in politics and a matter of political practicality. President Barack Obama, who won re-election with strong support from Latinos, the fastest-growing demographic, has called an overhaul of immigration a second-term priority. Meanwhile, Republicans who lost the Latino vote by large numbers, have signaled that mainstream members might be willing to compromise on thorny immigration issues. \u201cThere aren\u2019t a whole lot of other issues where Republicans think they need to compromise or Democrats think they need to compromise,\u201d said Clyde Wilcox, a government professor at Georgetown University. \u201cThere\u2019s two different ways this could be viewed this. It\u2019s either a Kumbaya moment \u2026 or both sides see that on this particular issue there\u2019s a necessity for compromise.\u201d But the deal is far from done. The plan could face stiff opposition in the House of Representatives, where conservatives and tea party leaders have resisted any compromise that even hints at relief or amnesty for those already in the country illegally. House Republicans are also working on a plan of their own, seeking bipartisan support. And Obama is said to have drafted his own detailed plan, which could differ from the Senate proposal in key areas, including border security and a path to legality. Obama to pitch immigration reform today in Vegas Why is GOP shifting on immigration? McCain's new try on immigration Senators: Common ground on immigration Immigration politics 'upside down'? The senators announced their plan a day before Obama speaks in Las Vegas on immigration, signaling a major push by both sides to focus on the contentious issue in the new Congress. Aides said the president\u2019s remarks on Tuesday will touch on the blueprint he\u2019s detailed in the past: improving border security, cracking down on employers who hire undocumented workers and creating a pathway to \u201cearned\u201d citizenship for undocumented immigrants. Those provisions align closely with what the eight senators laid out in a framework of their legislation, which CNN obtained Sunday. Possible compromise on immigration takes shape Obama previously came under criticism from Latino activists for failing to deliver on a 2008 campaign promise to make immigration reform a priority of his first term. Last year, as the campaign heated up, the Obama administration announced a halt to deportations of some young undocumented immigrants in a move that delighted the Latino community. Exit polls in November indicated Latino voters gave overwhelming support to Obama over GOP challenger Mitt Romney, who had advocated a policy that amounted to forcing undocumented immigrants to deport themselves. Since the election, mainstream Republican leaders and some conservatives such as Sen. Marco Rubio, a child of Cuban immigrants and a rising star in the party, have called for addressing the immigration issue instead of ceding the Latino vote to Democrats. \u201cThere is a new, I think, appreciation on both sides of the aisle \u2013 including maybe more importantly on the Republican side of the aisle \u2013 that we have to enact a comprehensive immigration reform bill,\u201d Sen. John McCain, R-Arizona, said Sunday. \u201cWe are losing dramatically the Hispanic vote, which we think should be ours, for a variety of reasons, and we\u2019ve got to understand that,\u201d McCain told ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week.\u201d McCain is one of the eight senators proposing the compromise. Four are influential Democrats, while Republicans joining McCain in the effort include tea party-backed newcomers Rubio of Florida and Jeff Flake of Arizona \u2013 two states where immigration is a major issue. Democrats pointed to the proposal Monday as an example of bipartisan cooperation. \u201cI\u2019m glad to see that there is bipartisan agreement among my colleagues regarding the principles of immigration reform,\u201d Sen. Mazie Hirono of Hawaii said in a statement. \u201cHawaii residents are particularly interested in getting this done. Our state is an example of how our immigration system can work. We are a people of many stories and cultures, and our state is stronger because of the thousands of immigrants like me who have made Hawaii their home.\u201d Borger: For GOP, it's about survival GOP changing tone on immigration Immigrant family fears being torn apart Feinstein on immigration overhaul The Congressional Hispanic Caucus also hailed the effort. \u201cFor many years, the Congressional Hispanic Caucus has pushed for a permanent, legislative solution to our ineffective and unjust immigration system, and we believe 2013 will be the year this goal becomes reality,\u201d Rep. Ruben Hinojosa, D-Texas, the caucus chairman, said in a statement. \u201cThe Senate\u2019s blueprint is a positive step toward this important goal, and we look forward to reviewing the details with the Senate. Their \u2018tough, but fair\u2019 approach provides a good foundation for the legislation that is needed. According to a CNN/ORC International poll conducted this month, 53% of those polled said allowing illegal immigrants to become legal residents should be the main focus of U.S. policy, compared with 43% who said the focus should be on deportation and curbing illegal immigration. Those figures have flipped from 2011, when 55% of those polled favored deportation and nixing illegal immigration as a domestic policy focus and 42% said they favored a pathway to citizenship. Still, the immigration overhaul proposal faces partisan obstacles. Opinion: America needs 21st century immigration plan Shortly after the immigration compromise was announced, conservative groups and lawmakers made it clear that they would oppose such a measure. NumbersUSA, a group seeking to reduce U.S. immigration, called the Senate plan an attempt to \u201cout-amnesty Obama\u201d and said it was activating its 1.3 million members to push for congressional opposition. \u201cNo one should be surprised that individuals who have supported amnesty in the past still support amnesty,\u201d said Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas, a former chairman of the House Judiciary Committee who serves on that chamber\u2019s immigration subcommittee, in a statement. \u201cWhen you legalize those who are in the country illegally, it costs taxpayers millions of dollars, costs American workers thousands of jobs and encourages more illegal immigration. By granting amnesty, the Senate proposal actually compounds the problem by encouraging more illegal immigration.\u201d The bipartisan compromise is encouraging, but several questions remain, said Norm Ornstein, a longtime political analyst and co-author of \u201cIt\u2019s Even Worse Than It Looks: How the American Constitutional System Collided with the New Politics of Extremism. Opinion: Stars align at last for immigration plan \u201cOne, will this compromise make it through the Senate, once the details are hammered out (always more difficult than frameworks) and with a lot more than 60 votes? Two, will House Republicans, who have very different impulses and constituencies, be supportive? Three, if not, will (House Speaker John) Boehner bring an immigration bill to the floor that will get many more Democratic votes than Republican?\u201d Ornstein said. Other Senate-led bipartisan efforts have faced similar chances of success. Proposals to resolve the debt crisis \u2013 including the so-called super committee \u2013 failed. The nation was able to avert the fiscal cliff narrowly thanks, in part, to the bipartisan efforts of Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell and Vice President Joe Biden. But political experts said that on immigration, there might be more room to meet in the middle. Still, for his part, Boehner was noncommittal. \u201cThe speaker welcomes the work of leaders like Sen. Rubio on this issue, and is looking forward to learning more about the proposal in the coming days,\u201d Boehner spokesman Michael Steel said.

            "article_content": "How should immigrants obtain citizenship? Share your thoughts on CNN iReport. Push to get immigration reform through Congress shows power of Latino vote in last election Reid says immigration reform bill would be labeled S-1, the Senate's first bill in the new Congress Senators announced their bill ahead of Obama to try to convey a bipartisan tone to their effort Outlook in the House is iffy -- some conservatives don't agree with path to citizenship A bipartisan group of senators on Monday introduced a plan for overhauling U.S. immigration policy a day before President Barack Obama was to lay out his plan. The eight senators say their plan will secure the border and provide a path to citizenship some undocumented immigrants already in the country. Critics say the citizenship component is granting amnesty for those who entered the country illegally. Immigration plan: A new era of bipartisanship or a political necessity? Here are some frequently asked questions on immigration reform: Q: What\u2019s behind this latest immigration reform plan? GOP changing tone on immigration Barrasso talks immigration changes Why is GOP shifting on immigration? A: The new push for immigration reform follows devastating poll results for Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney, who in November won just 27% of the Latino vote. That\u2019s down from 44% for President George W. Bush in 2004 and 31% for Sen. John McCain four years ago. The dramatic slide jolted key Republicans to act quickly on the complex and emotional issue that has divided the parties for years. Republicans long have argued that Latino voters, many of whom are Catholic and pro-life, would find a home in the GOP if not for the harsh rhetoric some Republicans use to debate illegal immigration. Democrats also are under pressure to reach a deal. Many Latino voters were disappointed  that President Barack Obama didn\u2019t work harder in his first term to pass a bill. Immediately after his election, Latino leaders pushed the president to make sure it would be a priority for his second term. As a signal of how important the issue is for Senate Democrats, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid announced last week an immigration reform bill would be labeled S-1, meaning it\u2019s Senate bill No. 1 of the new Congress \u2013 and clearly a top priority. Why this time? Q: Why did the senators announce their plan the day before Obama was to present his? A: The senators decided to unveil their plan ahead of the president in order to give their proposal \u2013 and the entire reform effort \u2013 a bipartisan tone, something they believe is critical to winning passage in the Senate and House, according to sources familiar with the bipartisan Senate framework. In fact, at a private White House meeting Friday, some senior Democratic members of the Congressional Hispanic Caucus pushed the White House to hold off introducing its own legislative language out of fear that the specifics, as spelled out by a Democratic president, could upset the delicate bipartisan balance the negotiators had reached. Why the time may be right Q: Will there be enough support in the House for this plan? A: It\u2019s unclear because many House conservatives have opposed allowing undocumented workers an opportunity to gain U.S. citizenship. This controversial issue could prove to be a real test for House Speaker John Boehner\u2019s leadership because it splits the House Republican conference. If the Senate is able to pass a bill, the speaker could again be faced with a decision whether to bring up a measure that has significant Democratic support but potentially only a minority within his own ranks. Or Boehner could decide to move a separate House immigration plan. Boehner was noncommittal when the details of the Senate were unveiled.  His spokesman put out a brief statement not taking a position, but pointing out Florida Republican Sen. Marco Rubio, who is popular with conservatives, was part of the group drafting the plan. \u201cThe speaker welcomes the work of leaders like Senator Rubio on this issue, and is looking forward to learning more about the proposal in the coming days,\u201d Boehner spokesman Michael Steel told CNN. There are also bipartisan discussions going on in the House on immigration, but one Democratic aide familiar with the discussions told CNN of that effort, \u201cIt\u2019s not quite ripe yet.\u201d But in a speech last week, Boehner signaled the House would act, saying, \u201cIt\u2019s time to deal with it. I said it the day after the election, I meant it.  We\u2019re going to have to deal with it.\u201d Sweeping immigration changes proposed Boehner also alluded to the House bipartisan talks, not giving any details, but saying the group was \u201cin my view the right group of members.\u201d He also added, \u201cMy theory was if these folks can work this out it would be a big step in the right direction.\u201d But already, some House Republicans are dismissing the most controversial piece of the Senate plan to allow a path to citizenship as \u201camnesty\u201d illustrating the challenge to get a deal through the House. Texas Republican Rep. Lamar Smith put out a statement on Monday arguing \u201cby granting amnesty, the Senate proposal actually compounds the problem by encouraging more illegal immigration.\u201d By the numbers: Immigration and naturalization Q: Could any of the Senate plan be a starting point for compromise with the House? A: Many House Republicans have called for strengthening border security, and insist that issue be the top priority before any steps are taken to grant citizenship to those in the United States illegally. But the bipartisan immigration framework from the Senate ties the two issues together to attract support from both parties. If House Republicans attempt to separate these it could up jeopardize the chance for comprehensive immigration reform. The new Senate framework also includes a component that the GOP-led House already addressed last year \u2013 it awards green cards for those foreigners at U.S. universities studying science, technology, engineering and mathematics, to encourage them to stay and work in the United States. House Republicans passed a bill establishing so-called \u201cSTEM\u201d visas last fall, but it was largely opposed by Democrats because it canceled another visa program.",

            "article_content": "NEW: House lawmakers are also said to be working on a bipartisan immigration plan NEW: President Obama will not present legislation, but call for action, during a speech Tuesday Eight senators, four from each party, unveil a \"first step\" toward an agreement Conservatives reject the senators' plan as \"amnesty\" Millions of undocumented immigrants would get immediate but provisional status to live and work in America under a compromise plan proposed Monday by a bipartisan group of eight senators. While temporarily removing legal uncertainty for the nation\u2019s 11 million undocumented immigrants, the senators\u2019 outline also called for strengthening border controls, improved monitoring of visitors and cracking down on hiring undocumented workers. Only after those steps occurred could the undocumented immigrants already in the country begin the process of getting permanent residence \u2013 green cards \u2013 as a step toward citizenship, the senators told a news conference. \u201cThey would no longer be deported, provided they don\u2019t have a criminal record. They would no longer be harassed, they would be allowed to stay here and work,\u201d said Democratic Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York in describing the immediate impact of the framework if crafted into legislation and enacted. The outline for a possible immigration bill reflects a new willingness by mainstream Republicans to compromise following their party\u2019s defeat in November, when President Barack Obama got strong backing from Latino voters. \u201cElections, elections,\u201d answered Republican Sen. John McCain of Arizona, a veteran of past immigration battles in Congress, when asked to explain the push now for a bill that proved unattainable two years ago. Rep. Israel talks immigration bill Sen. Feinstein on immigration reform Wadhwa on immigration and job creation \u201cThe Republican Party is losing the support of our Hispanic citizens,\u201d McCain said. \u201cWe realize that there are many issues on which we think we are in agreement with our Hispanic citizens, but this is a preeminent issue with those citizens.\u201d His party and all Americans now realized that \u201cwe cannot continue as a nation with 11 million people residing in the shadows,\u201d McCain added. Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, a tea party-backed conservative considered a rising star in the Republican party, said the goal was to create a \u201cmodern immigration system\u201d that treated everyone fairly \u2013 both the undocumented and those waiting to come to America legally. \u201cNone of this is possible if we don\u2019t address the reality there are 11 million people in this country who are undocumented,\u201d Rubio said. However, another tea party-backed Republican, Sen. Mike Lee of Utah, objected to the framework by his colleagues, saying the guidelines \u201ccontemplate a policy that will grant special benefits to illegal immigrants based on their unlawful presence in the country.\u201d Other conservatives immediately voiced their opposition to what they called amnesty, a code word on the political right for providing undocumented immigrants a path to legal status. \u201cWhen you legalize those who are in the country illegally, it costs taxpayers millions of dollars, costs American workers thousands of jobs and encourages more illegal immigration,\u201d said Rep. Lamar Smith, R-Texas, who serves on the immigration subcommittee in the House. \u201cBy granting amnesty, the Senate proposal actually compounds the problem by encouraging more illegal immigration.\u201d NumbersUSA, a group seeking to reduce U.S. immigration, called the Senate plan an attempt to \u201cout-amnesty Obama\u201d and said it was activating its 1.3 million members to push for congressional opposition. House Speaker John Boehner\u2019s office was noncommittal, saying he looked forward to learning more about the senators\u2019 plan. A similar effort on immigration is said to be under way in the House, involving a group of Republicans and Democrats. Two senior House Democratic sources briefed on the effort told CNN the group was working to release some sort of outline of its plan soon, possibly as early as this week, but concede \u201cthey are not as far along as the Senate.\u201d Like the Senate framework, the House plan will include a path to citizenship, but details of how that will work are still being discussed. McCain and Rubio, joined by three Democratic colleagues at the news conference, acknowledged the political challenge, with Rubio calling the legislative process ahead \u201cenormously complicated.\u201d Read the senate plan Obama is expected to deliver a speech in Las Vegas on Tuesday to discuss comprehensive immigration legislation, which he calls a priority of his second term. According to senior administration officials, the president will say the senators\u2019 plan represents progress and argue that now is the time to act. He will lay out his vision for immigration reform, which is consistent with the Senate plan, they said. Obama is not expected to present legislation during his speech, nor anytime this week. At the White House, spokesman Jay Carney said the president welcomed the senators\u2019 framework, calling it a \u201cbig deal\u201d because it included an eventual path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants. \u201cHe is encouraged by the progress we have seen from members of both parties in the Senate, and looks forward to working with members of both parties to reach a point in the hopefully not too distant future where we have a bill that has bipartisan support, that is very specific, and that he can sign because it meets his principles,\u201d Carney said. Path to citizenship: Senators outline bipartisan immigration plan Meanwhile, a litany of left-leaning advocacy groups spoke out on the senators\u2019 plan, praising it as a good first step but cautioning against harming the rights of workers. \u201cThe people of this country are ready for us to be one country again without second-class people being mistreated simply because they lack paper even though they are already contributing to our economy and our tax system,\u201d noted NAACP President Ben Jealous. Democratic senators backing the plan include Schumer, Dick Durbin of Illinois, Robert Menendez of New Jersey, and Michael Bennet of Colorado. On the Republican side, McCain and Rubio were joined by Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Jeff Flake of Arizona. What you don\u2019t know about Latinos in America The eight senators based their framework on four \u201cpillars,\u201d described as: \u2013 A \u201ctough but fair\u201d path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants already living in the United States, but only after bolstering the nation\u2019s border security; \u2013 Overhauling the country\u2019s legal immigration system, including attaching green cards to advanced degrees in science, technology, engineering, or math from U.S. universities; \u2013 Establishing an employment verification system that holds employers accountable for hiring undocumented workers; \u2013 Creating a guest-worker program for positions that Americans are either unable or unwilling to fill. Lawmakers: GOP needs to back immigration overhaul A source familiar with how the eight senators came up with the plan told CNN that Graham called Schumer after the November vote to restart work on an immigration bill that broke down in 2010. Soon, a core group of six senators formed and met five times in the following weeks in the offices of Schumer and McCain, the source said, adding that Flake and Bennet also took part in some of the meetings and were the last to agree to the proposal. Opinion: Worker visas are the key to immigration reform Schumer said Monday that an initial timetable called for delivering the text of a bill to the Senate Judiciary Committee by March, and Senate passage by late spring or in the summer. He and Durbin called Obama on Sunday to tell him of the agreement by the senators, Schumer said, describing the president as \u201cdelighted.\u201d DREAMer\u2019s clout increases in immigration debate Obama came under criticism from Latino activists for failing to deliver on 2008 campaign promise to make immigration reform a priority of his first term. Last year, as his re-election campaign heated up, the Obama administration announced a halt to deportations of some young undocumented immigrants in a move that delighted the Latino community. Exit polls in November indicated Latino voters gave overwhelming support to Obama over GOP challenger Mitt Romney, who had advocated a policy that amounted to forcing undocumented immigrants to deport themselves.

            "article_content": "Barack Obama promised but couldn't deliver comprehensive reform Latinos factored heavily in Obama's re-election, giving them more political clout In defeat, Republicans may see immigration reform as politically smart Comprehensive immigration reform has so far eluded President Barack Obama. But with his re-election victory in battleground states propelled by strong Latino support, Democrats and Republicans in Congress have a stronger interest in cultivating support from a group with growing political clout. Here are five reasons why the time may be right for immigration reform to take hold in Washington. 1) The voters have spoken Immigration reform may not have been the biggest issue in the election \u2013 the economy was paramount \u2013 but it is very important to a key segment of voters. Latino voters turned out in force and helped to tip battleground states in Obama\u2019s favor.  The number of registered Latinos has increased by 26% in the past four years to 12.2 million, or 8.7% of all voters. That means this demographic will only increase its political power. Issues important to this minority logically will become increasingly important to both major political parties. A new electorate has arrived Giuliani: Immigration reform a hurdle 2) Obama promised but failed to deliver on immigration reform Obama promised to push for immigration reform before the 2008 election and had to answer tough questions from Latinos about why that did not occur. At a forum by the Spanish-language Univision network, Obama was pressed to admit that he had fallen short and took responsibility for a lack of action. But the president also said he didn\u2019t promise he would accomplish everything he wanted right away. There also is some Latino disillusionment with the stalled Dream Act in Congress. This proposed law would create a path to citizenship for some young undocumented immigrants. Obama did sign an executive order that defers deportation for undocumented immigrants brought to the United States as children, but it did not change current immigration law. The president has said he is ready to act. He told the Des Moines Register in an interview before the election that he believes he will achieve immigration reform next year. Opinion: How progress is possible 3) There is a bipartisan starting point Having bipartisan support for immigration reform will not ensure passage \u2013 it didn\u2019t for President George W. Bush in 2007 \u2013 but without it, chances are even slimmer. Just days after the election, a leading Democrat and Republican announced that they hope to start debate this year. Sen. Charles Schumer of New York, the third-ranking Senate Democrat, and Republican Sen. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina say they will officially restart immigration reform talks that crumbled two years ago. Schumer told NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d that he and Graham have a plan designed to appeal to interests on all sides of the highly contentious issue, and he\u2019s optimistic that it can get through a Congress hobbled by political gridlock in recent years. The plan includes four key elements: stronger border security, creation of forgery-resistant proof-of-citizenship documents, fairer legal immigration for desirable candidates, and a \u201ctough love\u201d path to citizenship for those already in the United States. Opinion: Both parties must lead 4) Republicans want to win a larger share of the Latino vote The election results thrust the immigration issue back into the spotlight partly because Republican nominee Mitt Romney won only 27% of the Latino vote compared to 71% for Obama. Why Romney lost The GOP wants to reverse the trend of decreasing Latino support at the ballot box. Already, Republican lawmakers, political commentators and thought leaders have adopted a more conciliatory tone when discussing immigration. Carlos Gutierrez, the former commerce secretary who led Romney\u2019s outreach to Latino voters, told CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d the candidate \u201cmade some mistakes\u201d during his campaign that ultimately led to a precipitous drop in Latino support. The Republican primary process forced Romney to move to the right on immigration, something that didn\u2019t sit well with many Latino voters. To avoid repeating the mistake, Republicans may consider working on immigration reform. 5) Democrats do not want to diminish their share of Latino vote The Democratic Party benefited from Latino votes but that support is not assured in the future, especially if the Republicans move toward the center on immigration. The Obama administration is responsible for a record-setting number of deportations even as it has employed prosecutorial discretion to focus on high-priority cases. The Democrats will have to work with Republicans if they want to reform an immigration system both parties agree is broken. iReport: Under Deportation, Above Fear",

President Barack Obama is expected to kick off the push Tuesday with a speech in Las Vegas and to lay out more specifics during his State of the Union address on February 12. Obama has called addressing immigration the top legislative priority of his second term, and a group of Democratic and Republican senators says it  plans to lay out its framework for a bill this week. \u201cFirst of all, Americans support it in poll after poll,\u201d one of those lawmakers, Sen. Robert Menendez, D-New Jersey, told ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week.\u201d \u201cSecondly, Latino voters expect it. Thirdly, Democrats want it. And fourth, Republicans need it.\u201d Obama begins immigration push with trip to Vegas Wadhwa on immigration and job creation The politics of immigration reform Though many activists were unhappy with Obama for failing to tackle the issue in his first term, he won 71% of the Latino vote in November against Republican challenger Mitt Romney \u2013 who had said he would drive undocumented workers to \u201cself-deportation\u201d by making conditions so harsh for them that they left the United States. Carlos Gutierrez, who was secretary of commerce during President George W. Bush\u2019s second term, told CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d that while immigration isn\u2019t the top issue for Latinos, \u201cwhat they sense is that we don\u2019t welcome them. And we have to be the party that celebrates immigration.\u201d Sen. John McCain, a veteran of failed attempts to address the issue during the Bush administration, said the proposals he and the other senators are hammering out aren\u2019t \u201cthat much different from what we tried to do in 2007.\u201d And the Arizona Republican told ABC they will include offering a path to citizenship for the estimated 11 million undocumented immigrants in the United States \u2013 the issue that effectively sank previous bills. This time, \u201cThere is a new, I think, appreciation on both sides of the aisle \u2013 including maybe more importantly on the Republican side of the aisle \u2013 that we have to enact a comprehensive immigration reform bill,\u201d said McCain, the party\u2019s 2008 presidential nominee. \u201cWe are losing dramatically the Hispanic vote, which we think should be ours, for a variety of reasons, and we\u2019ve got to understand that,\u201d McCain added. November\u2019s poor showing among Latinos has led to a soul-searching for the GOP, which hopes to make gains among the growing voting bloc in coming years. CNN Poll: Do Americans agree with Obama on climate change and immigration? In the past, conservative Republicans have characterized any path to citizenship for illegal immigrants as \u201camnesty.\u201d Even McCain sharpened his rhetoric on the issue when he sought re-election in 2010, emphasizing border security and calling on the federal government to \u201ccomplete the dang fence\u201d separating the United States from Mexico, the largest single source of illegal immigration. Obama, meanwhile, stepped up the use of National Guard troops to patrol the southern border, and deportations grew to nearly 400,000 in 2011. And the 2007-2009 recession in the United States helped cut sharply into the number of migrants in recent years, the Pew Hispanic Center reported in 2012. Rep. David Schweikert, R-Arizona, told ABC that while the United States needs to draw talented immigrants, \u201cif you go to the southern part of my state, I have people who actually live in fear for what\u2019s going through literally the back of their house, their property.\u201d \u201cThe devil\u2019s ultimately in the details,\u201d Schweikert said. \u201cWhat will happen to the populations today, but what will happen to our border security for those of us who are border states? What will happen in the visa system?  Will we actually have a visa system that works, that tracks those who\u2019ve overstayed, and then what does the future look like?\u201d But in a CNN-ORC International poll in mid-January, 53% of Americans said the main focus of U.S. policy on illegal immigration should be finding a way to allow undocumented residents to get legal status. By comparison, 43% said the priority should be border security and deportations. \u201cI\u2019m cautiously optimistic,\u201d Menendez said. \u201cI see the right spirit. I see things that were once off the table for agreement and discussion being on the table with a serious pathway forward.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Reince Priebus, who engineered turnaround in GOP's finances, is up for re-election RNC was so far in debt when Priebus took job that he had to use own credit card to travel Priebus says GOP must attract women, minorities, who delivered election to Obama RNC chairman says marathon debate schedule in primaries hurt GOP in general election The chair, perhaps the most famous chair in political history, stands in the office of a large, nondescript cement building just a stone\u2019s throw away from the U.S. Capitol. That\u2019s right, the chair Clint Eastwood used as a prop in his rambling and at times incoherent critique of President Barack Obama at the Republican National Convention is now one of the many pieces of political memorabilia in Reince Priebus\u2019 spacious office on First Street in Washington. The chairman of the Republican National Committee gets the joke; the chair is the first thing he points out to a reporter before sitting down behind his desk to discuss how his party must dramatically rethink its strategy and message in hopes of recovering from the national drubbing of 2012. The second collector\u2019s item he shows off is a yellow foam cheesehead autographed by Green Bay Packers quarterback Aaron Rodgers. It reads: \u201cTo Reince, from one QB to another, Best Wishes! Aaron Rodgers.\u201d Reince Priebus on Romney and GOP future Adviser: GOP must show gun control plan Rep. King: Healing today, work tomorrow Rodgers might be on to something. As RNC chairman, Priebus isn\u2019t calling the plays: That\u2019s up to House Republican leadership and the ambitious GOP governors roaming state capitols around the country. But he is reading the other team and making crucial adjustments to the game plan. Priebus is also the general manager, responsible for helping build the team and manage the expectations of ownership. And he has many owners to answer to: 168 Republicans who make up the national committee, deep-pocketed donors who write the checks, grass-roots activists who provide conservative energy, and the lawmakers who have an immediate personal stake in the party\u2019s success. Boehner says Obama\u2019s focus is to \u2018annihilate the Republican Party\u2019 A two-tiered goal to restructure, rebrand GOP That\u2019s why Priebus is developing a political plan he hopes, in the near term, will re-energize his party in time for the 2014 midterm elections, while also developing a long-term strategy to compete among key demographic voting blocs \u2013 Hispanic, Asian, African-American \u2013 that broke so heavily Democratic in November. To hear Priebus tell it, the goal is two-tiered: restructure the party on a tactical level to match the sophisticated and data-driven efforts of the Obama campaign, and create a communications plan to sell the GOP\u2019s message to voters it failed to connect with in 2012. GOP\u2019s surprising edge on diversity It\u2019s an overwhelming task and it\u2019s going to cost money, lots of money. \u201cI\u2019ve been meeting with donors since the election in November,\u201d Priebus said. \u201cI would say I am pleasantly surprised how quickly the donors who have given so much are ready to build a party that is a year-round operation.\u201d Bennett: GOP, play offense in Obama\u2019s second term Christie: 'I'd be more ready' in 2016 'Cliff' vote and 2016 election 2016 prospects take on gun control As he reflected on the presidential race, it quickly became clear that one of the most bothersome aspects of the presidential race was the marathon debate schedule. The primary debates were a point of frustration for some Republicans, who felt the process was controlled by the news media, not the party, in the past election. \u201cI believe that No. 1, we have to control the debates,\u201d Priebus said. \u201cI think that having over 20 debates is too many, and I think we ought to regulate the debates, pick the moderators and get involved in setting the calendar.\u201d Priebus cautioned his comments are not set in stone and he described his ideas in \u201chypothetical\u201d terms. One idea he mentioned was instituting a penalty system in which candidates for the nomination would lose a percentage of delegates if they participated in a debate not sanctioned by the RNC. Dark horse candidates hungry for media attention would likely oppose such a move, but it\u2019s unclear if they would have the power to prevent a change in the rules. The idea of handpicking moderators would also face stiff opposition from the media organizations who foot the bill to stage and broadcast the debates. Primary calendar needs to be condensed As for the primary calendar, Priebus said he would like to see it condensed to allow the eventual GOP nominee more time to prepare for the general election. In an ideal world, he said, the intra-party fight would start later and finish sooner, with the Republican National Convention possibly being held as early as June. But he doesn\u2019t talk about changing the order of the four leadoff primary and caucus states \u2013 Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina \u2013 that have traditionally kicked off the nomination process. \u201cI think that the carve-out states have served us well, but I think the timing of the calendar and the rest of the calendar issue should be looked at,\u201d he said. Priebus rejected the notion of the RNC becoming involved in presidential primaries to assist the strongest candidate, but he was quick to point out that state Republican parties can choose to play in primaries if they want. \u201cState parties can decide for themselves,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s their choice.\u201d In terms of outreach to minorities, Priebus said the GOP failed to pass a very basic test. Attracting minority voters a key GOP goal as Obama begins second term \u201cWell, for one thing, we have to ask for the vote,\u201d he said. \u201cYou have to ask for it and I don\u2019t think that we\u2019ve been doing a very good job of that.\u201d Priebus said a glaring organizational flaw for Republicans is that there have been no long-term investments made in human capital to help sell the GOP message on a neighborhood to neighborhood level. It\u2019s more than just having an outreach director in a state \u2013 it\u2019s having dedicated, full-time staffers on a grass-roots level to run \u201cvoter registration, hold community events, go to swearing-in ceremonies \u2026 having real job descriptions for lots and lots of people on a yearlong basis in communities that move the dial.\u201d The party\u2019s standing among Hispanics emerged as a damaging sore spot last year for national Republicans, who were forced to answer for hard-line immigration positions from prominent conservative figures, including their own presidential nominee. Obama won with 71% of the Hispanic vote, according to CNN national exit polls. Outreach to Hispanics has already begun, Priebus says \u201cI think you are seeing a lot of movement from our party on these issues,\u201d said Priebus, who said outreach has already begun. \u201cA lot of it, I tell you, was tone. You know, it wasn\u2019t necessarily the policy on immigration, it was what is coming out of your mouth.\u201d He specifically mentioned a comment by Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney, who suggested illegal immigrants might \u201cself-deport\u201d and leave the country willingly. \u201cWhen you talk about stuff of self-deportation, it is probably not the best place to start,\u201d Priebus said. Still, Priebus said he believes that Republicans, not Democrats, better represent the ideals and goals of all voters, including minorities who turned out in droves to re-elect the president. Priebus plans to explain his vision for the overhaul of his party in more detail to the 168 RNC members who arrive in Charlotte, North Carolina, this week for a three-day meeting that will focus almost entirely on this subject. Five Republican heavyweights \u2013 Henry Barbour, Sally Bradshaw, Ari Fleischer, Zori Fonalledas and Glenn McCall \u2013 are helping Priebus craft the recovery plan, dubbed \u201cThe Growth and Opportunity Project.\u201d Just as Obama asked Democrats to nominate him as their presidential nominee in Charlotte in September, Priebus will ask RNC members on Friday to elect him to another two-year term. It will be more of a formality than an election, because Priebus has only token opposition and has locked down enough support to maintain his role as chairman. \u201cBoth the grass-roots and the donors have to be on the same page, and I think I am in a unique position to do that,\u201d he said. Priebus predicts a more \u2018granular\u2019 approach for GOP Priebus is in a unique position because of his financial stewardship of the national committee, which two years ago was saddled with nearly $25 million in debt after the departure of controversial former RNC chairman Michael Steele. \u201cOur money situation here was so bad that both credit cards were suspended when I walked in the door,\u201d he said. \u201cSo when we went to go book travel or anything like that, we didn\u2019t have a credit card to put the travel on. Fortunately, we had my two credit cards, so we maxed out both of those cards.\u201d Priebus estimated he spent $40,000 to $50,000 on his personal credit cards, which he was eventually reimbursed. Dialing for dollars became Priebus\u2019 priority, a tough task for a depressed donor base that saw super PACs and the congressional campaign committees as viable alternatives to the poorly managed RNC. When he started as chairman, Priebus said there were fewer than 100 major RNC donors, people who contributed more than $15,000 per year. By the close of his first year, he said 1,000 people were donating $30,000-plus each year. Paperwork filed with the Federal Election Commission showed the RNC ended 2012 with about $3.3 million in the bank and no debt. Unlike two years ago, Priebus won\u2019t have to use his own credit card to pay for his plane ticket to Charlotte. Now the big question is whether he will be able to raise enough money to transform the party, and if he can, will his fellow Republicans embrace his plan?",

            "article_content": "House GOP leaders pushing 10-year plan to balance budget Conservatives criticize progressive themes in President Obama's inaugural address The House will vote Wednesday on a plan to spark budget negotiations Some House Republicans oppose leadership's plan to suspend debt ceiling The first day of business of President Barack Obama\u2019s second term began with a prayer service Tuesday, but it will take more than spiritual guidance to change the divisive culture of Washington politics. Conservative critics of the president wasted no time ripping into an inaugural address laden with progressive themes such as climate change, gun control, gay rights and immigration reform. More specifically, they targeted the president\u2019s vigorous defense of costly but popular entitlement programs such as Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. \u201cOne thing that is pretty clear from the president\u2019s speech yesterday \u2013 the era of liberalism is back,\u201d said Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky.  \u201cAn unabashedly, far left-of-center inauguration speech certainly brings back memories of the Democratic Party of ages past.\u201d Was President Obama's address partisan? Previewing Pres. Obama's second term How will history judge Obama's speech? Obama catches Reid taking inaugural pen If Obama \u201cpursues that kind of agenda, obviously it is not designed to bring us together and certainly not designed to deal with the transcendent issue of our era, which is deficit and debt.  Until we fix that problem, we can\u2019t fix America.\u201d Obama\u2019s inaugural address \u201cwas trying basically to throw a bone to every left-wing activist group he could,\u201d said Rep. Dave Schweikert, R-Arizona. Back at work, Republicans assess Obama\u2019s address Americans for Prosperity, a conservative group that focuses on fiscal policy, labeled Obama\u2019s speech \u201charshly ideological\u201d and akin to \u201ca liberal laundry list.\u201d The group will \u201cbe in the vanguard of the effort to oppose the president\u2019s big government policies,\u201d its president, Tim Phillips, said in a statement Monday. In his inaugural address, Obama insisted that programs such as Social Security and Medicare \u2013 long targets of conservatives seeking to cut the size of government \u2013 remain vital to the maintenance of America\u2019s safety net for the elderly, poor and disabled. Second-term priorities \u201cWe, the people, understand that our country cannot succeed when a shrinking few do very well and a growing many barely make it,\u201d Obama declared, adding that tough decisions on how to address the nation\u2019s chronic federal deficits and debt must avoid choosing between \u201ccaring for the generation that built this country and investing in the generation that will build its future.\u201d While some Republicans sounded less combative, they said they were nevertheless disappointed by the president\u2019s inaugural remarks. Obama \u201ccould have found some way to be more constructive,\u201d Rep. Peter King, R-New York, told CNN.  \u201cI think he should have done more to say there\u2019s honest disagreement\u201d instead of characterizing the debate as \u201cthe voice of reason on his side\u201d and \u201cshrill cries on the other side.\u201d King acknowledged that some on the right \u201care never going to agree\u201d with Obama but insisted the president needs to indicate a willingness to compromise with the GOP to make progress on the major issues facing the country. House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Virginia, told CNN on Monday that while \u201cthere are plenty of areas of disagreement \u2026 there also are some things fundamentally we agree on, and that is this country is one of opportunity.\u201d Marine Band: Beyonce lip-synched Differences involve \u201cthe way we get there to help everybody,\u201d Cantor said, adding that \u201chopefully, we can bridge those differences.\u201d The Republican response reflected in part a continuing split between conservatives resisting concessions to the president and GOP moderates trying to buff up the party\u2019s tarnished reputation in light of a growing public perception of congressional dysfunction. A House vote set for Wednesday on suspending the federal debt ceiling for three months will provide the first test of GOP resolve. The measure represents the latest in a series of Republican concessions on spending and debt issues, with House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, and his leadership team proposing the debt ceiling increase without any spending cuts they had previously demanded to offset the cost. In return, they demand that the Democratic-controlled Senate pass a budget for the first time in four years, which would provide a platform for a detailed congressional debate on spending. Otherwise, the measure calls for legislators to forgo their salaries until they complete a spending plan. Granderson: Obama\u2019s rallying cry Boehner told House Republicans in a meeting Tuesday afternoon that passing a short-term debt ceiling suspension \u201cbuys time for the House and Senate both to pass a budget,\u201d according to a GOP source at the gathering. The source noted that former vice presidential nominee and House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan, R-Wisconsin, will work with House GOP leaders to draft a budget by an April 15 deadline.  The budget would place federal spending on a trajectory to eliminate the deficit within 10 years, a goal shared by the speaker. \u201cIt\u2019s time for the Senate to act,\u201d Boehner told reporters after the GOP meeting.  \u201cYou can\u2019t continue to spend money you don\u2019t have.\u201d Obama, who rejects any negotiations over the debt ceiling, has welcomed the House plan as a step forward because it prevents immediate brinksmanship over whether the government will meet its financial obligations.  A political battle over raising the debt ceiling in 2011 contributed to the first-ever downgrade of the U.S. credit rating. Four of your top second-term priorities The White House Office of Management and Budget released a statement Tuesday afternoon noting that while \u201cthe administration supports a long-term increase in the debt limit that would increase certainty and economic stability, \u2026 the administration would not oppose a short-term solution to the debt limit.\u201d The White House \u201clooks forward to continuing to work with both the House and the Senate to increase certainty and stability for the economy,\u201d the statement concluded. However, some conservative House Republicans oppose Boehner\u2019s debt ceiling measure, setting up a possible repeat of previous votes in which the speaker failed to get enough support from his GOP conference to push through a bill. What else could Washington waste four years doing? \u201cI think it\u2019s a terrible idea,\u201d Rep. Tom McClintock, R-California, told Fox Business Network on Monday, arguing the plan \u201cgives the most spendthrift administration in this country\u2019s history literally an open credit card to borrow as much as they can.\u201d Rep. Louie Gohmert, R-Texas, also disagreed with giving up the leverage of the debt ceiling without any guaranteed spending cuts in return. \u201cAt some point, we have got to use the leverage we have to bring this spending down and to actually make the president do what he said in his speech,\u201d Gohmert told FBN. In addition, Gohmert complained that Boehner\u2019s plan essentially gives the \u201cmillionaires club\u201d in the Senate the power to determine whether he and other House members who need their congressional salaries will get paid. At the White House, spokesman Jay Carney called the House GOP plan \u201ca welcome thing\u201d and rejected accusations that Obama\u2019s address Monday amounted to liberal ideology. \u201cHe focuses on the fact that we are Americans first, and I hardly thing the pursuit of equal rights, pursuit of comprehensive immigration reform, pursuit of sensible policies that deal with climate change and enhance our energy independence are ideological,\u201d Carney said Tuesday. In the Senate, Majority Leader Harry Reid outlined an agenda that closely conformed to the priorities of the president\u2019s inaugural address the day before. NRA chief: Obama makes \u2018mockery\u2019 of American freedoms \u201cThe last Congress was too often characterized by sharp political divides \u2013 divides that hampered efforts to foster success for all Americans,\u201d the Nevada Democrat said, telling his colleagues that \u201cit is possible to hold fast to your principles while making the compromises necessary to move our country forward.\u201d At the same time, Reid said Senate Democrats \u201cwill stand strong \u2013 strong \u2013 for the standard of balance, and we will remain resolute \u2013 resolute \u2013 in the pursuit of fairness for all Americans, regardless of where they were born or the color of their skin, regardless of the size of their bank accounts, regardless of their religion or their sexual orientation.\u201d McConnell also called for compromise but said it was Democrats who must be willing to meet in the middle. \u201cOver the past four years, while the president focused on re-election and too many Senate Democrats focused on avoiding tough decisions, the debt grew by more than $6 trillion,\u201d McConnell said. \u201cIn short, Democrats have put off all the hard stuff until now. And our problems have only gotten worse. But that was the first term.\u201d Saying \u201ca lot of Democrats are afraid of a process that exposes their priorities, particularly on spending and debt,\u201d McConnell made clear that Republicans reject any further increases in tax revenue after the fiscal cliff deal at the end of the last Congress that raised rates on top income earners. \u201cSince the revenue question has been settled,\u201d he said, \u201cI\u2019m sure the American people are eager to see what other ideas Democrats might have to bring down our ruinous deficits.\u201d CNN Poll: Do Americans agree with Obama on climate change and immigration?

            "article_content": "Demographic changes in Ashburn, Virginia, gave Obama a narrow win there The community is bitterly divided but wants the president and Congress to find compromise Perhaps it's time to let go of ideology, says an Ashburn psychologist Others have their own messages for Obama as he begins a second term The alternating red and blue yard signs are long gone, and people here have gone back to familiar rhythms of life. Long morning commutes, after school soccer games and maybe a family dinner at Clyde\u2019s Willow Creek Farm. But, as Barack Obama begins his second term, the air is decidedly unchanged in this northern Virginia community of tidy subdivisions and endless rows of townhouses. After a viciously fought, pavement-pounding political campaign, the people are left divided, the gulf between them wide like the grassy medians that separate left and right sides of the roads that lead to the nation\u2019s capital. Obama\u2019s address: Full text There is the reliably Republican old Ashburn. Some of those folks remember lush fields and woods brimming with redbuds and ash. Legend has it the place took its name from an old ash struck by lightning so hard that it smoldered for a week. There is the new divided Ashburn that looks like America\u2019s new normal. An explosion of growth in the last two decades turned this place from a largely white conservative constituency to one that is darker-skinned and comprised of more professional women. They call themselves progressive thinkers and are a big reason that Obama in 2008 became the first Democrat to win here \u2013 and in the state of Virginia \u2013 since Lyndon B. Johnson\u2019s victory in 1964. This time, the commonwealth again hung in the balance. Loudoun County was a battleground within a battleground. Ashburn was its epicenter. 10 inaugural moments that mattered In the end, Obama took Virginia with 51% of the vote to Mitt Romney\u2019s 47%, but Obama won in Ashburn\u2019s nine precincts by a mere 212 votes. In the Belmont Ridge precinct, the difference was six votes. That\u2019s how close it was here. The people in Ashburn hold widely differing visions of how to steer America in the next four years, but they are tired of the partisan bickering in the halls of power in Washington. They wonder what happened to the voices of reason, the voices of moderation. About eight in 10 people see partisan divide as the largest conflict among Americans, according to a Pew Research Center survey released last week. Here in Ashburn, the people want that conflict to subside. Their wish is voiced in unison: Mr. President, they say, \u201cWe want you to work with Congress. We want you to fix America.\u201d Mitt Romney and Barack Obama entered the room a lot more than I thought they would. We\u2019re not feeling confident as a nation that we\u2019re doing well. \u2013 Mike Oberschneider  America, the patient Mike Oberschneider, 44, founded his Ashburn psychology practice in a suite of offices atop a strip-mall grocery called Giant. He was attracted to the area for the same reasons so many others are: a high standard of living, good schools and Washington just 40 miles away. Ashburn boasts the nation\u2019s highest median household income, in part because of dual incomes. Many here work for the federal government, defense contractors and tech companies. Facebook, Amazon, Wikipedia and Microsoft all have data centers in the area. More than 50% of the world\u2019s Internet data runs through Loudoun County. But it is also a place where housing and the costs of daily life are high and when the economy started its downward plunge, people felt the stress. Oberschneider believes the wave of optimism Obama rode in 2008 quickly waned as the recession choked America. One day gas was $3.50; the next month, it was $4.50, he says. One day the Dow closed at 12,000. The next it plunged to 8,000. It all made for an uncertainty that began to commandeer people\u2019s lives. \u201cMitt Romney and Barack Obama entered the room a lot more than I thought they would,\u201d Oberschneider says of his sessions with patients. \u201cWe\u2019re not feeling confident as a nation that we\u2019re doing well.\u201d Oberschneider, who voted for Obama in 2008 but not in 2012, says the president was dealt a bad hand. He took office last time just when the recession was taking hold. \u201cBut he played it all wrong,\u201d Oberschneider believes. And it got too negative and too aggressive all too quickly. Oberschneider wants to tell Obama this: \u201cI\u2019d like to see you stretch your ideological bandwidth,\u201d he says. \u201cHolding on to an ideology, even though it\u2019s true to your heart, is not the right approach.\u201d Read more: Second inaugural like second marriage He sees America like one of his patients \u2013 perhaps an alcoholic or someone in a failing marriage. The patient is in bad shape and Obama needs to help. \u201cI don\u2019t think it mattered who won \u2013 Obama or Romney. We\u2019d be facing the same problems,\u201dhe says. \u201cAs a nation, we need to get more responsible. Debate less. Agree more.\u201d They all eat BBQ but they don\u2019t vote the same way Not far from where that ash tree is said to have smoldered, there\u2019s a blazing fire at Danny Hurdle\u2019s barbecue joint. Everything here is pig. Pig aprons, pig signs, pig candy holders. A chalkboard next to the entrance proclaims: \u201cToday\u2019s pig was from South Mills, N.C.\u201d Not really, Hurdle laughs. His grandkids wrote that to honor their pop-pop\u2019s hometown. What\u2019s now Carolina Brothers Pit Barbeque used to be a landmark in Ashburn: the Partlow Brothers store. They sold groceries, hardware, gas, oil. Hurdle, 64, is a stonemason by trade but bought the Partlow building six years ago and took up barbecue. From Hurdle\u2019s place, it\u2019s easy to imagine the old Ashburn. Some of the Victorian houses have been restored with curatorial care, though many of the old buildings were torn down. There are still trees and greenery here along Ashburn Road, but perhaps not for long. NV Homes planted a trailer a stone\u2019s throw from Hurdle\u2019s place to build 18 high-end homes in a newly developed cul-de-sac. All 18 are stamped sold on the site plan. Hurdle can feel the changes sweeping Ashburn. He can see it every day in his restaurant. On this day, there is a young Sikh boy, a Muslim man and working women on a lunch break. He added beef and chicken to his menu to keep up with changing dietary needs. \u201cNot everyone eats pig,\u201d he says. \u201cBut they all eat barbecue.\u201d He also thought they would all vote for Romney. \u201cI was surprised the election was so close,\u201d he adds. He shows off a picture of a sign that a friend sent him: \u201cGuns allowed on premises.\u201d It\u2019s in line with Hurdle\u2019s values. One of the reasons he voted for Romney was because he is against abortion, he says. Employee Jen Steele pipes up. She\u2019s 23 and working her way through nursing school. She grew up in a Republican family but says her generation has gone beyond aligning with parties. Oops! Biden gives himself promotion \u201cFor me, it\u2019s issues,\u201d she says, working the cash register. \u201cI didn\u2019t vote for Romney.\u201d \u201cFor the same reason I voted for him,\u201d Hurdle says. Steele voted for the GOP in 2008 but was turned off by comments from Republican politicians on rape and abortion. It felt like an assault on women. She thought Obama delivered a message of inclusiveness, like he cared for everyone no matter what their station in life. She even saw a TV ad he made entirely in Spanish. \u201cBut he\u2019s got his work cut out for him,\u201d she says. Hurdle answers: \u201cMaybe we need term limits in Congress.\u201d The new Americans Attorney John Whitbeck, 36, makes it a point to show up at events like Diwali, the Hindu festival of lights, where he tries to tout the merits of the GOP. South Asians tend to vote Democratic. Republican state delegate David Ramadan filed a bill this year that would officially recognize Diwali day. Whitbeck, chairman of the 10th Congressional District Republican Committee, concedes his party did not do a great job in reaching out to Loudoun\u2019s newest citizens. Between the 2000 and 2010 Census, Loudoun County\u2019s white population dropped from 83% to 69%. The county is now almost 15% Asian (a huge number are from the Indian subcontinent) and 13% Hispanic. The rapidly changing demographics played a big role in Obama\u2019s victory here, as they did nationally. \u201cIt all starts with the recognition that the cultural framework of Loudoun County includes them,\u201d Whitbeck says. \u201cOur children go to the same schools yours do. You are just as able to be a part of the Republican Party as the white middle-class guy.\u201d But that message has so far fallen short with many South Asians like accountant Hari Sharma. who sees the GOP as making token efforts to gain his vote. He has hope in his heart that this president will make America feel more like home to those who are fairly new here. \u201cObama\u2019s policies are more supportive of immigrants,\u201d he says. As someone who looks at income tax returns for a living, he thinks Obama is on the right track by increasing taxes for the wealthy. Sharma says Obama has done a good job in turning the economy around and thanks the president for his 401(k) rising back up after it was halved. He applauds Obama for starting the new year with an effort to curb gun violence. \u201cWe come from a peace-loving culture,\u201d he says. Sharma, 49, met his wife, Sarita, 39, after both left their native Nepal and enrolled in university in Virginia. They settled in Loudoun County in 2004, part of the explosive wave of immigrants looking for opportunities that are scarce back home. They worked for AOL for a while. Sharma now runs his own accounting business. Their daughter Simron sits in her father\u2019s home office studying for two exams the next day. Math and journalism. Sarita Sharma yells from the living room. \u201cI want an A in both.\u201d That\u2019s the South Asian ethic. Study hard or you won\u2019t be prosperous in life. Education guarantees are important for the Sharmas. They want Obama to set policies that will increase accessibility to college, make it more affordable, especially for foreign students. They see Obama as a president who extends a hand to people of color. That\u2019s important to Sharma when South Asians are underrepresented institutionally.  \u201cWe want our voices heard,\u201d he says. Obama\u2019s reach to minorities is a big reason Barbara Mitchell says he is the right man to lead America at this juncture in the nation\u2019s history. Obama 2.0: Smarter, tougher \u2013 but wiser? Mitchell, 53, was born to Panamanian parents but was adopted and raised by a white couple in Maryland. She had taken, as she calls it, a perilous journey of the heart to find her family. On this dreary January day, her niece is visiting Ashburn from Panama City and Mitchell is trying out her brand new countertop grill to make blueberry pancakes. She says she read that Virginia was one of the top 10 states for Latino voter impact. Last year, she worked hard to bring more Latinos in Ashburn and Loudoun County, many of whom hail from El Salvador and Mexico and are less educated than their Asian counterparts, into the political fold. She set up shop in front of an international grocery. She registered only two people that day but handed out 40 fliers describing the path to citizenship and got an earful about how devastating deportations were. It was an epiphany of sorts. \u201cImmigration. Immigration. Immigration reform,\u201d she says. That\u2019s what she wants to tell Obama. Education matters so much in terms of breaking into the middle class. I just feel it\u2019s going to be really tough for young, impoverished Latinos. \u2013 Barbara Mitchell  Stop the deportations that separate families and then help Latinos in this country get a better education, she says. Some 41% of Hispanics who are 20 or older do not have a regular high school diploma, according to the Pew Research Hispanic Center. \u201cEducation matters so much in terms of breaking into the middle class,\u201d she says.  \u201cI just feel it\u2019s going to be really tough for young, impoverished Latinos.\u201d A strong nation Corporate executive Ralph Buona ran for a county supervisor post last year because he believed the area needed people like him with strong business backgrounds to deal with whirlwind growth. In 2000, there were just 30 schools in Loudoun County; now there are 82. Buona, 57, is less interested in the social issues that make people think vivid red and blue. \u201cPeople\u2019s concerns in Ashburn are fiscal,\u201d he says. \u201cI\u2019d tell Obama to stop dictating and start being a leader. I\u2019d say you\u2019re only half of the deal. You\u2019re great at increasing revenues but you have to start looking at costs.\u201d It\u2019s a position that architect Bob Klancher agrees with. \u201cIt\u2019s the national debt that\u2019s crushing us,\u201d he says. \u201cI don\u2019t understand what a lot of folks saw in the president that made them want to rehire him.\u201d Klancher, 54, was raised in Cleveland by parents of Slovenian heritage who worshiped Jesus, FDR and JFK. He was the first one in his family to earn a college degree. In his first presidential election in 1976, he just couldn\u2019t vote for Jimmy Carter. Carter\u2019s policies didn\u2019t make sense to him. He has voted Republican ever since. But polarization of the nation, he believes, began in the 2000 election after the Supreme Court had to step in to help decide the Florida results. \u201cBoth parties have drummed out the moderates. People take absolutist stances whether it\u2019s the Republicans with their no-tax pledge or the Democrats on spending. I am frustrated.\u201d CNN Poll: Country split on how things are going He wants Obama to bring back the optimism Americans once had that their children\u2019s lives will be better than theirs. Younger Ashburn residents like Caleb Weitz understand Klancher\u2019s concerns. He\u2019s 25 but already stashes about 10% of his salary working at the Board of Supervisors office in his retirement account. \u201cAs a young person, I\u2019m not expecting to get Social Security,\u201d he says. \u201cThere\u2019s also a concern in my generation about how much debt is being handed down.\u201d But Weitz has one other major concern. As a young American, he is proud that his country has been a leader; that it has been able to help other nations, guide them to form democratic societies and adopt the values Americans cherish. He\u2019s come to terms with the notion that he will perhaps retire without the safety nets his parents had, including Social Security. But he wants the country he grows old in to still be the world\u2019s superpower. Friends in Obama Madeline Lewis, 62, works on employment discrimination cases for the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission. Stephanie Brunotts, 53, is a stay-at-home mom. The two became friends working for the Obama campaign. They were part of the ground game in Ashburn that pushed Obama over the top. They registered voters, knocked on doors, drove people to the polls. Anything to get their man in for another four years. At Brunotts\u2019 townhouse, Lewis, a diehard Redskins fan \u2013 she has season tickets \u2013 rattles off all the things that will matter to her in Obama\u2019s second term. Women\u2019s rights. Gun control. Access to education. Obama\u2019s second-term priorities \u201cI\u2019m concerned about our inner cities,\u201d says Lewis, who grew up in Newark, New Jersey. \u201cI want everyone to be educated, get a job. That way, they are not breaking into my house.\u201d The two talk about the Newtown tragedy. Lewis, who is divorced, bought a handgun for personal protection but she doesn\u2019t know why anyone would need to own an assault weapon. She wants to tell Obama to bring back some manufacturing to America. Everything seems to be made somewhere else now. She wants the president to give incentives for companies to stay here. She almost sounds like her Republican neighbors. \u201cThe clothes they make in China are garbage,\u201d she says, picking her ginger ale off Brunotts\u2019 coffee table, which prominently displays the Time magazine cover of Obama\u2019s win in 2008. Brunotts says Obama did all he could in his first term with his hands tied. She points to Obamacare. \u201cWho knew people would have this level of health care?\u201d The two women wonder why the country had become so polarized. \u201cRomney\u2019s father was a moderate Republican,\u201d Lewis says. \u201cPeople worked together then.\u201d Maybe Washington has reached rock bottom, Brunotts says. \u201cMaybe it had to break for it to start fresh, to fix it.\u201d Things get worse before they get better Back at the Giant supermarket complex, Oberschneider, the psychologist, thinks it will take a while for Ashburn \u2013 and the nation \u2013 to heal. But sometimes, he says in true form to his profession, things need to get worse before they get better. Like an alcoholic in a terrible car accident. That\u2019s how he views the ideological divide. He says he respects Obama. \u201cHe\u2019s still my president.\u201d And that he, like everyone else in America, needs to be able to believe in him. \u201cI would love to do a group therapy session with all of them \u2013 the president, Congress,\u201d he says. Then he leans back in his oversized chair, in his darkened office in the middle of Ashburn, Virginia, and says: \u201cI think it would take more than one session.\u201d Complete coverage: The 2013 Presidential Inauguration",

After four years of partisan fighting and instability, will pendulum swing to the middle? Obama had full agenda before school shootings inserted gun control onto plate Fiscal issues will be early test whether optimism of second term persists Activists hope environmental issues and energy policies aren't pushed aside President Obama began his second term with a \u201ckeeping it real\u201d moment courtesy of youngest daughter Sasha. \u201cYou didn\u2019t mess up,\u201d she told the president after the oath was administered by Chief Justice John Roberts in the White House Blue Room. It all went off without a hitch compared to four years ago when a redo was required after flubs during the swearing-in ceremony at the Capitol raised doubts about its legitimacy. With a sense of relief on Sunday the president declared, \u201cI did it.\u201d Photos: Best of 2013 inauguration President Obama takes oath Past four years in four minutes Past four years in four minutes Was President Obama's address partisan? Was President Obama's address partisan? 100 years of inaugurations in 2 minutes Obama\u2019s address: Full text But over the next several months, those words will be much more difficult as the president pushes Congress to embrace his priorities, from gun control to immigration reform to raising the debt ceiling. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a pendulum of instability, arguing, fighting,\u201d said CNN contributor and Republican strategist Ana Navarro. Compromise was Washington\u2019s needle in a haystack, discovered often in the 11th hour. But now there\u2019s a tinge of optimism as the president gets to work in his second and final term. \u201cI think we\u2019ll see it (pendulum) come back to the middle sooner rather than later,\u201d Navarro said. A tale of two terms: Obama\u2019s unfinished business and battles ahead Gun control The first big test is shaping up to be an issue that never came up on the campaign trail and wasn\u2019t even on Washington\u2019s radar. Gun violence came into sharp focus after the Sandy Hook Elementary School shootings that took the lives of 20 children and six adults. It sparked a heated debate and led to new measures the president plans to put in place through executive action or with congressional approval. Steps quickly assembled aimed at curbing gun violence, such as universal background checks and a ban on high-capacity magazine clips of more than 10 rounds. Four other priorities for Obama\u2019s next four years \u201cIt\u2019s common sense\u201d said Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa, who has been pushing for stricter gun laws. \u2018It makes sense. It\u2019s not a radical notion.\u201d But the National Rifle Association and other gun groups are ready for a fight, swinging with searing TV ads and a public rebuke of the administration\u2019s efforts. While polls indicate the majority of American\u2019s support the president\u2019s efforts, some political observers have doubts about Washington\u2019s ability to produce any meaningful change. \u201cNo one Democrat or Republican wants to deal with that issue. It\u2019s not popular,\u201d said CNN contributor and conservative activist Erick Erickson. \u201cThey want to just do something for the sake of symbolism.\u201d Obama in select company Debt ceiling The new term will also feature some old fights. The debt ceiling round two was shaping up to be another fierce fiscal showdown. House Republicans had insisted on spending cuts in exchange for raising the debt ceiling. President Obama warned he was not going to negotiate. With the prospect of a default and the Treasury Department taking steps to bridge the gap, Congressional Republicans  backed  off a bit, with plans to vote next week on a three-month deal to extend the debt ceiling. It\u2019s not a long-term solution, but it takes some air out of a contentious battle the president would have faced immediately. \u201cI understand the games the Republicans are playing, but the game the American people want them to play is play fair,\u201d said Democratic strategist and CNN contributor Donna Brazile, who argued the rich should pay their fair share and struggling Americans should not be \u201cdisproportionately hurt\u201d by deep cuts. Gergen: Obama 2.0 \u2013 tougher, wiser? Immigration reform One large and important constituency will be watching the president\u2019s second term closely. They care about gun violence and fiscal matters but want to see quick action on immigration reform. Hispanics, who voted overwhelming for Obama, 71%-27% over Republican challenger Mitt Romney, had hoped for more progress in the president\u2019s first term. Amid record deportations, USA Today columnist Raul Reyes says there was a lot of anxiety in the Latino community. \u201cIt really seemed like he had forgotten about his promise on immigration.\u201d Biden on Obama at start of second term: \u2018In simpatico\u2019 The White House points to steps the president did take, like an executive order to stop deporting some young illegal immigrants who entered the country as children. That wasn\u2019t enough and the president admitted as much in his post-election news conference when he vowed again to deliver on his promise. \u201cI\u2019m very confident that we can get immigration reform done,\u201d the president said as he drew an outline of what that would look like: Stronger border security, penalties for companies hiring undocumented workers and a pathway to legal status for otherwise law-abiding illegal immigrants. Some key Republicans have signaled a willingness to tackle this issue. \u201cI found a commitment among many of the important Republicans, the leadership, many of the rank-and-file, who want something on immigration, Navarro said. \u201cThere have been a lot of things happening behind the scenes.\u201d Photos: Obama\u2019s face all over the place Other key issues The spotlight shines less brightly on environmental concerns, climate change and energy policies, but activists and others are working to keep these issues from being ignored in the second term. In his inaugural address the president is not expected to detail policy initiatives. Top advisers say he will touch on broad themes and put meat on the bones during his State of the Union address next month. The president will work to define his legacy in the second term and plans to aggressively engage the public to put pressure on Congress. His campaign grassroots organization is back in action as a nonprofit group to further his objectives. \u201cWe\u2019ll all work to help transform Washington from the outside\u201d Jon Carson, the new executive director of Organizing for Action, wrote to supporters in an email. But reality lurks in the wings as many Republicans are still skeptical. \u201cThe president seems so fixated on demonizing Republicans that he is blinded to the opportunities as well as the obligations that he has to deal with big problems in this country,\u201d said Sen. John Barrasso, R-Wyoming, on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union.\u201d Obama\u2019s inauguration: In the crowd",

At the start of his second term, Barack Obama has major issues left undone from his first Deficits, Social Security and Medicare are carrying over into his second-term agenda. Education. Science and technology advances also are issues that may shape next four years What a difference. Barack Obama assumed the presidency four years ago on a day full of history and hope. The second time around there is less hype, far lower expectations, and no illusions about the capital\u2019s political climate. \u201cI just want things to work,\u201d then President-elect Obama told CNN in an interview days before taking office in 2009. To revisit that conversation is to be reminded that on many of the big issues on the original Obama agenda, Washington did anything but work \u2013 or at least work together. Obama\u2019s address: Full text Photos: Best of 2013 inauguration President Obama's public oath of office Previewing Obama's second term Barrasso: We want Obama to succeed Was President Obama's address partisan? His signature first-term achievement \u2013 health care reform \u2013 was accomplished despite near unanimous Republican opposition. Many other priorities he listed just before taking the oath of office four years ago are still waiting for serious attention - or progress \u2013 as he begins term two. \u201cThe deficit levels I\u2019m inheriting \u2013 over $1 trillion coming out of last year \u2013 that is unsustainable,\u201d the president-elect said in his final interview before the 2009 inauguration. Yet deficits in each of his first four years topped $1 trillion. More of his first inaugural wish list: \u201cLet\u2019s get a handle on Social Security. Let\u2019s get a handle on Medicare.\u201d Four other priorities for Obama\u2019s next four years Deficits, Social Security and Medicare are now carrying over to the second-term agenda. So does immigration. New to the list is a promise to push an assault weapons ban and other gun controls. What do all of these have in common? They are issues ripe for confrontations with Republicans, especially at a time the GOP\u2019s conservative base is determined to reassert itself. Yet that wish list also puts the president at odds, to varying degrees, with members of his own party. Liberals, for example, vow to resist any major Medicare changes. Centrist and conservative Democrats, especially those with tough re-election prospects in 2014, are hardly rushing to embrace new gun controls. Inaugural poet: My story is America\u2019s Not to mention a varied and unpredictable portfolio of international challenges \u2013 from a volatile Middle East to evolving economic and security challenges in an Asia increasingly defined by China. And then there is this: the ticking clock of any president\u2019s second term. How long will it take before the lame duck debate begins in earnest? Second term priorities \u201cThey won\u2019t have more than a year, 18 months tops,\u201d said the veteran Republican strategist Mary Matalin, who in addition to her deep campaign experience served as a top adviser to President George W. Bush and his vice president, Dick Cheney. Her own experience in the second Bush-Cheney term shapes her early take on the political climate as Obama begins his fifth year in office: \u201cWith the six-year itch midterm and a 2016 open primary looming, it will be all positioning all the time.\u201d As in the first four years, the strength of the American economy will determine more than anything else how much room the president has to advance his top priorities. A unified voice rises from a divided place: Mr. President, please fix America Education. Science and technology advances. Critical infrastructure investments. Top Obama adviser David Axelrod lists those as first-term priorities that, in his view, not only carry over to the next four but will shape whether the second Obama term is a success. \u201cHow do we position the American economy for the 21st Century?\u201d is Axelrod\u2019s one sentence take on the president\u2019s second-term challenge. A tale of two terms Obama\u2019s preparations included a recent session with presidential historians to discuss not only the climate he faces, but the historical differences for past presidents given the opportunity to serve a second term. President Obama is the fourth of the last five presidents to get a second term. The others - Ronald Reagan, Bill Clinton and George W. Bush - all had major events that undermined their political standing. For Reagan it was Iran-Contra. Clinton had the gift of a booming economy, but any thought of making progress on major generational challenges, like Medicare and Social Security, were sidetracked by the Monica Lewsinsky scandal and the impeachment saga. Obama in select company Bush began his second term with opposition to the Iraq war on the rise, and was further damaged by the deeply held view that his administration failed to properly respond to Hurricane Katrina. To Matalin, a fierce Republican critic, a major early second-term challenge for Obama will be to change what she sees as a political reflex that has undermined his ability to work with GOP leaders in Congress. \u201cSecond terms exacerbate both strengths and weaknesses,\u201d she said. \u201cIf you are humility challenged, self-reverential and self-righteous like Obama, you get even more hubris and demonize rather than debate your opponents.\u201d Biden on Obama at start of second term: \u2018In simpatico\u2019 Obama aides bristle at suggestions he is responsible for the trust deficit with the GOP; they say Republicans made a decision very early on in the first term to oppose virtually every Obama initiative. In their view, the burden is on the GOP in term two to show a more cooperative tone and mindset. Matalin also raised an operational challenge for second-term presidents: high turnover in senior positions, from the White House staff to key Cabinet positions. \u201cAnyone who hasn\u2019t left is exhausted,\u201d she said. \u201cAnyone who is new is not top drawer.\u201d Obama\u2019s second-term priorities",

Shortly after exhorting the United States to continue its \u201cnever-ending journey\u201d to live up to the ideals of its founders, on his way off the platform at the West Front of the Capitol, President Barack Obama stopped to drink in the scene before him. \u201cI want to take a look one more time,\u201d he told those surrounding him. \u201cI\u2019m not going to see this again.\u201d And so, with his oath of office taken \u2013 again \u2013 and the speech delivered, the president stood aside for 24 seconds on the chilly Monday afternoon, letting the crowd that had joined him for his formal, public second inauguration file past. It was one of the few quiet moments on an otherwise jam-packed day. Obama stole another such moment with his wife, at the first of two official inaugural balls they were scheduled to attend Monday night. Obamas party with 30,000 close friends Obama: 'I'm not going to see this again' President Obama's full inaugural address Obamas walk part of parade route The inauguration: Behind the scenes Following performances by Alicia Keys, Brad Paisley and the Mexican rock group Mana, the first couple danced as Jennifer Hudson sang the classic song, \u201cLet\u2019s Stay Together,\u201d by Al Green. First lady Michelle Obama wore a floor-length, custom, ruby-colored chiffon and velvet gown designed by Jason Wu, the same designer behind her 2009 inaugural dress. The celebrations came a day after Obama was sworn in on the constitutionally required date in a low-key ceremony at the White House. The flag-waving crowd that watched Monday\u2019s event was noticeably smaller than the throng that turned out for his first oath in 2009 but still packed the National Mall for blocks. The waving flags, the red-white-and-blue bunting and the heralding trumpets marked the 57th such ceremony in the history of the nation, with the peaceful extension of power based on last November\u2019s election that returned Obama to the White House. The best Inauguration Day tweets The Sousa marches, the ceremonial guns and the voices of James Taylor, Kelly Clarkson and Beyonce having faded away, Obama headed into the Capitol for a luncheon with members of Congress. Then he led the traditional parade up Pennsylvania Avenue, stopping near the White House to walk a few blocks of the route with the first lady to the cheers of those lining the sidewalks. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to come out for this,\u201d said Nick Pignone, a Washington resident. \u201cEveryone\u2019s excited \u2013 good vibes right now.\u201d Also publicly sworn in for a second term was Vice President Joe Biden, who, like Obama, also took his official oath Sunday. Justice Sonia Sotomayor performed the honors for Biden at his home at the Naval Observatory in Washington, where the vice president\u2019s extended family and a few Cabinet officials gathered to watch the ceremony. Biden and his wife, Jill, also took some time to walk part of the parade route, with a grinning Biden periodically jogging over to the sidelines to shake hands with people across the barricades. Once both couples and their families were seated at the White House reviewing stand, one of the first acts to pass was the marching band from Honolulu\u2019s Punahou School, Obama\u2019s alma mater. What followed included dozens of military and school bands, Native American dance troupes whirling in traditional dress, war veterans, Civil War re-enactors, kilted firefighters blowing bagpipes and Montana\u2019s governor and congressional delegation on horseback and in cowboy hats. 10 opinions: Explaining Obama\u2019s speech Obama, the first African-American president and the 17th to win a second term, used a pair of Bibles in Monday\u2019s ceremony \u2013 one from Abraham Lincoln, the other from Martin Luther King Jr. His roughly 2,000-word inaugural address hearkened back to both. 2009: Obama inauguration makes history Tracing inauguration traditions Memorable inauguration speeches 100 years of inaugurations in 2 minutes \u201cI did everything possible today to keep from crying,\u201d said U.S. Rep. John Lewis, D-Georgia, a onetime lieutenant of King. He called the sight of Obama using King\u2019s Bible \u201cvery moving, unreal \u2013 almost unbelievable.\u201d Monday is also the federal holiday commemorating the birthday of King, who was assassinated in 1968. The loudest cheer of Obama\u2019s address came when he said the nation\u2019s journey remained incomplete \u201cuntil our wives, our mothers, and daughters can earn a living equal to their efforts,\u201d and \u201cuntil our gay brothers and sisters are treated like anyone else under the law.\u201d Obama embraces key social justice movements in inaugural address Obama begins the second half of his presidency with the opportunity to make it more historic but facing some of the same challenges that he struggled with in the first four years. Americans \u201chave the power to set this country\u2019s course,\u201d he said, urging people to fulfill their citizenship by meeting \u201cthe obligation to shape the debates of our time \u2013 not only with the votes we cast, but with the voices we lift in defense of our most ancient values and enduring ideals.\u201d On the Mall, Carlos Arieta and his wife, Sharon, took in the scene after driving from Atlanta to witness history. The former Washington residents said it was the first time they had attended an inauguration. Surprised by the throngs gathered a few hours before the speech on a clear morning with temperatures just above freezing, Arieta said \u201cit\u2019s nice to see all the different kinds of people.\u201d Even some of those who didn\u2019t support Obama\u2019s November re-election turned out to watch. Don King, 27, and his 21-year-old brother Matthew said they don\u2019t agree with the president on taxation, debt and other fiscal issues but didn\u2019t want to miss this bit of history. \u201cIt\u2019s the second inauguration for Obama, and it\u2019s pretty amazing if you think back to the 1800s and later during the civil rights era, that we\u2019re here,\u201d Don King said. Obamas, Bidens participate in National Day of Service A new CNN/ORC International poll released Monday indicated less excitement this time than four years ago, when nearly 2 million people crowded the Mall despite frigid weather for Obama\u2019s historic first inauguration. In January 2009, nearly seven in 10 Americans questioned in a CNN survey said they were thrilled or happy that Obama was about to take office. Now, according to the new, that number is down 18 points, to 50%. Back then, six in 10 saw Obama\u2019s inauguration as a celebration by all Americans of democracy in action, with just 39% saying it was a political celebration by the supporters of the winning candidate. Now, the numbers are nearly reversed, with 62% saying the second inauguration is a celebration by those backing the president, and 35% saying it\u2019s a celebration of democracy. \u201cThe thrill is gone, along with the hope that the start of a new presidential term of office will bring a divided nation together,\u201d said CNN Polling Director Keating Holland. Gergen: Obama 2.0 \u2013 tougher, wiser? Reality of second-term presidencies The smaller crowd this time around reflects the reality of second-term presidencies, when the novelty and expectations of a new leader have been replaced with the familiarity and experiences of the first act. For Obama, that difference is even sharper. His historic ascendancy to the White House in 2008 came with soaring public hopes and expectations for a new kind of governance that would close the vast partisan gulf developed in recent decades. However, a litany of challenges, including an inherited economic recession and repeated battles with congressional Republicans over budgets and spending, only hardened the opposing positions in Washington. Obama\u2019s signature achievements, including major reforms of the health care industry and Wall Street, became symbols of political division, with opponents constantly accusing him of hindering needed economic recovery. Obama\u2019s unfinished business and battles ahead For his second term, Obama has vowed to press for an overhaul of the nation\u2019s immigration policies and new ways to boost the sputtering economy, proposals that are bound to spark battles with his Republican rivals, and oversee the implementation of Obamacare. And the shootings at a Connecticut elementary school last month put the divisive issue of gun control on his immediate agenda. CNN polling released Sunday showed a majority of Americans \u2013 54% \u2013 believe Obama will be an outstanding or above average president in his second term, while 43% said he\u2019d be poor or below average. And while overall, seven in 10 Americans hope the president\u2019s policies succeed, only four in 10 Republicans feel that way, with 52% hoping that Obama will fail. Obama\u2019s second-term priorities But House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Virginia, told CNN, \u201cToday is the day for all of us in this country to come together.\u201d \u201cI think the president did a fine job, certainly, laying out what he would like to see happen as far as the future of the country,\u201d Cantor said. \u201cThere are areas of disagreement, but there are also some things fundamentally we agree on, and that is this country is one of opportunity. And sort of the way we get there to help everybody, there are some differences. Hopefully, we can bridge those differences.\u201d Four other priorities for the next four years CNN\u2019s Jennifer Liberto, Dana Bash, Dana Davidsen, Ashley Killough, Paul Steinhauser, Jessica Yellin, Dan Lothian, Brianna Keilar, Kevin Liptak and Gregory Wallace contributed to this report.",

The country, in the last four years, has been battered by an economic earthquake while trying to reconcile a debt load threatening to cripple the next generation. It has been pulled apart by political extremism and the inability to compromise in Washington. The people have been divided \u2013 by demographic shifts, cultural battles and clashes between the rich and the poor, the haves and the have-nots. So, days before the president\u2019s second inaugural, the nation, too, is set to regroup. What it does differently this time around and the decisions the people make, experts say, will speak to the kind of America that emerges during the next four years. Second inaugural address puts Obama in select company \u201cThe enormous promise that everyone felt four years ago, it isn\u2019t completely gone but we have diminished our horizons,\u201d said Robert Schmuhl, an American studies professor at the University of Notre Dame. \u201cWe have learned that we are now living in an era of limits.\u201dObama is perhaps more keenly aware of this than most. Hope and hurdles The 44th President was ushered into the Oval Office by a wave of seemingly limitless optimism and buoyed by the historic nature of his presidency as the first African American elected to the lead the free world. But once in office, he found his efforts to right an economy hobbled by high unemployment \u2013 10% at its worse in 2009 \u2013 and home foreclosure rates \u2013 one in 29 homes were in foreclosure between 2007 and 2012 \u2013 were limited by the magnitude of the problem and the political realities of a partisan Congress. His plan to reform the nation\u2019s healthcare system further expanded political divides in Washington and helped lead to huge losses among his party\u2019s moderates in the 2010 election. 100 years of inaugurations in 2 minutes The inauguration: What to expect Son of MLK on Pres. Obama's inauguration His re-election this fall \u2014 due in no small part to demographic shifts that included large numbers of minorities and women \u2014 was quickly followed by a protracted and deeply partisan showdown over trimming the nation\u2019s debt. By the numbers: Presidential inaugurations \u201cI think Obama has learned some things,\u201d said Curtis Gans, director of American University\u2019s Center for the Study of the American Electorate. \u201cHe\u2019s going to be unlike most second term presidents in that he will be far more assertive than he was in his first term. He will be stronger on pushback against some of the most extreme elements in the Republican House. He\u2019s willing to go to battle on the whole concept of getting the economy moving.\u201d The public saw hints of that assertiveness on Monday during a surprise news conference, where he lashed out at Republicans in Congress for playing politics with the debt ceiling. \u201cWe are not a deadbeat nation,\u201d Obama said during a nearly hour-long briefing from the East Room of the White House. It a newly combative tone, he called it \u201cabsurd\u201d for the federal government not to pay \u201cbills that have already been racked up\u201d and said he will not negotiate \u201cwith a gun at the head of the American people.\u201d From Obamacare to the economy to Sandy Hook Over the next four years, the country will also get a chance to see whether the Affordable Care Act \u2013 or \u201cObamacare\u201d \u2013 is a positive or negative step for the nation. In 2014, many of the most controversial provisions, including requiring individuals to either participate in a health insurance program or pay a penalty, take effect. \u201cWe will see whether or not we have the strength within ourselves to figure out how we should deal with entitlement programs,\u201d Schmuhl said. \u201cIn a way, it\u2019s a period when the administration will be dealing with problems that are in process.\u201d Obama\u2019s ability \u2013 or failure \u2013 to navigate all of this while coming off as a strong, levelheaded leader could help set the nation\u2019s tone for years to come. \u201cIf the economy becomes more robust you will have no doubt he will point back and say see that\u2019s what I was doing,\u201d said Julian Zelizer, a professor of history and public affairs at Princeton University and CNN contributor. Reagan, Clinton faced similar issues It\u2019s what happened when former President Ronald Reagan, who led the nation at a time when the country was reeling from a tough economy and just starting to get over the Vietnam War. In his second term \u201cthere was a sense America was moving in the right direction in terms of how it was doing around the globe,\u201d Zelizer said. When former President Bill Clinton took office the economy wasn\u2019t doing well, but by the second term the economy was picking up, allowing him to deliver a balanced budget and ultimate surplus by the end of his presidency. \u201cThere was clearly a shift in the mood,\u201d Zelizer said. \u201cIn both cases, the presidents were good at claiming credit for it.\u201d Mood matters in the age of austerity Everyday folks have learned to cut back and suck it up\u2014some after finding themselves underwater on mortgages they could not afford to pay; others after losing jobs that their companies could no longer afford to keep. So, Americans have been using their credit cards less and paying down debt more \u2013 household debt as a percentage of disposable personal income is at its lowest rate in almost 30 years, according to the Federal Reserve and credit card balances had reached their lowest level in more than a decade. And many expect the same discipline from their government. \u201cAmericans will be realistic, just as those in government need to be realistic,\u201d Schmuhl said of citizens\u2019 likely approach to their own finances over the next four years. But, as Obama enters his second term, both the housing and job markets have been on a slow and steady uptick. Housing sales were up 6% in 2012 \u2013 the biggest gain since 2005, according to CoreLogic \u2013 and the unemployment rate had dropped to 7.8% in December, although there are still 4.8 million Americans \u2013 or 39.1% of the jobless  \u2013 classified as long-term unemployed, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. \u201cGoing into the second term, the fiscal situation will continue the agenda and the discussion,\u201d he said. \u201cIt will say a lot about us and where not only the government but the nation might be going. If it is difficult and, shall we say, fractured and there\u2019s a sense coming out of it that things are not working as they should my guess is that the public will begin saying: \u2018When will Washington work on our behalf?\u2019\u201d Governing on a deadline That sentiment was foreshadowed in the frustration over the down-to-the-wire, partisan political maneuvering as the last Congress sought to avert the fiscal cliff\u2019s steepest domestic spending cuts. Obama appeared to prevail on that skirmish, delivering on a promise to raise tax rates on wealthy Americans \u2013 although he shifted his definition of \u201cwealthy\u201d from those making $250,000 or more to those making $400,000 and up. According to Pew Research Center and Gallup polls, Americans were none too impressed with how lawmakers handled the negotiations or the deal that was struck. Some 41% of those polled disapproved of the deal, according to Pew, and 52% thought the deal would hurt people like them. In the Gallup poll, 67% - disapproved of congressional Republicans\u2019 handled the negotiations while 55% disapproved of how Democrats performed. Still, partly due to deliberate redistricting to protect \u2013 or create \u2013 more partisan congressional districts, American voters continued to elect or re-elect safe representatives to do their bidding in Congress. For instance, most of the 435 members of the House of Representatives \u2013 Republicans and Democrats \u2013 faced little real opposition on Election Day in 2012. Other battlegrounds: Sequester, gun control, immigration But the next battle looms. Just weeks after Obama takes his oath of office, a new Congress will be tasked with addressing the automatic spending cuts, or sequester, that were kicked down the road in order to pass a smaller deal at the end of the year. The new Congress will also consider raising the nation\u2019s debt ceiling, or the ability of the U.S. Treasury to borrow money to pay America\u2019s bills. Most agree that defaulting on the nation\u2019s obligations would be disastrous for America and the global economy, but some Republicans in Congress are starting to hint that they may be prepared to let that happen anyway if large spending cuts are not secured. And after that, the fight over gun control, a high priority for the White House in the aftermath of the Connecticut school massacre, will pit the president against many members of the House and Senate from safe districts with high ratings and big-dollar donations from gun rights advocates. The president and vice president unveiled a major plan on Wednesday that included 23 executive actions the president has ordered on his own, while urging the new Congress to take on the meaty issues of an assault weapons ban, limits on the number of bullets a gun magazine can hold, and other sweeping reforms the gun lobby and others say would gut the constitutional right to bear arms. Immigration reform, another White House priority, will also stoke ideological differences and test the demographic shifts in Congress. For the first time, the House Democratic caucus is dominated by women and racial minorities, while the Republican caucus in that chamber is largely composed of white men. In the Senate, 20 women \u2014 the largest number in history \u2014 currently hold office. But women and minorities are far outnumbered and outranked by white males on some of the most powerful congressional committees. And despite several high-ranking exceptions, Obama\u2019s Cabinet \u2013 so far \u2013 is shaping up to be largely male and white. \u201cThe first thing we learned is that we\u2019re not post-race. That was a lot of willful imagining in \u201908 that his election would allow us to transcend these questions of race,\u201d said Mark Anthony Neal, a cultural and Black studies professor at Duke University. \u201cThe American electorate is looking different in terms of race and ethnicity and young folks being engaged. In 2016 our political realities will look more like our demographic realities.\u201d And that\u2019s where the nation\u2019s shift over the next four years may be most visible. But look first to the 2014 midterms and then the 2016 presidential election to see if the people signal continued frustration with the current regime \u2013 in Congress and in the White House \u2013 or demonstrate through the power of their vote that they feel the nation has finally turned the corner.",

            "article_content": "President Obama's inaugural address eschews poetry for rhetorical power The president's speech invokes core themes of his re-election campaign His progressive address mentions climate change, gay marriage David Gergen: Obama said \"let's talk about what's essential\" President Barack Obama sought to link the past and future on Monday in his second inaugural address, tying the nation\u2019s founding principles to the challenges confronting his second term in a call for Americans to fulfill the responsibility of citizenship. Eschewing poetic language for rhetorical power, Obama cited the accomplishments of the past four years while laying out a progressive agenda for the next four that would tackle thorny issues like gun control, climate change and immigration reform. \u201cWe have always understood that when times change, so must we; that fidelity to our founding principles requires new responses to new challenges; that preserving our individual freedoms ultimately requires collective action,\u201d he said. \u201cMy fellow Americans, we are made for this moment and we will seize it so long as we seize it together,\u201d he added later. Analysts called the speech politically astute and an important expression of new forcefulness by the president as he enters his second term following re-election last November. \u201cIt\u2019s a real declaration of conscience, about principles, about what he believes in,\u201d said CNN Senior Political Analyst David Gergen. \u201cHe basically said, \u2018When I came in the first term, we had all these emergencies, we had these wars. We\u2019ve now started to clear the decks. Let\u2019s talk about what\u2019s essential.\u2019\u201d Obama speech addresses social justice movements The foundation of the address, and Obama\u2019s vision for the future, were the tenets he quoted from the Declaration of Independence \u2013 \u201cthat all men are created equal, that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable rights, that among these are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.\u201d \u201cToday, we continue a never-ending journey, to bridge the meaning of those words with the realities of our time,\u201d Obama said to gathered dignitaries and flag-waving throngs on the National Mall. \u201cFor history tells us that while these truths may be self-evident, they have never been self-executing; that while freedom is a gift from God, it must be secured by His people here on Earth.\u201d See the Inauguration Day highlights Memorable inauguration speeches In particularly pointed references, the president made a forceful call for gay rights that equated the issue with the struggle for women\u2019s rights in the 19th century and civil rights in the 1960s. \u201cWe, the people, declare today that the most evident of truths \u2013 that all of us are created equal \u2013 is the star that guides us still; just as it guided our forebears through Seneca Falls, and Selma, and Stonewall,\u201d Obama said, mentioning landmarks of the women\u2019s, black and gay rights movements. \u201cIt is now our generation\u2019s task to carry on what those pioneers began,\u201d he continued, prompting the loudest applause and cheers of his address when he said \u201cour journey is not complete until our wives, our mothers, and daughters can earn a living equal to their efforts.\u201d Opinion: 11 views on Obama\u2019s speech More cheers came when Obama called for \u201cour gay brothers and sisters\u201d to be treated \u201clike anyone else under the law \u2013 for if we are truly created equal, then surely the love we commit to one another must be equal as well.\u201d According to observers, it was the first time a president championed gay marriage in an inaugural address. With further mention of topical issues such as immigration reform and gun control, Obama came to his key point \u2013 that adhering to America\u2019s bedrock principles requires taking action on today\u2019s challenges. \u201cBeing true to our founding documents does not require us to agree on every contour of life; it does not mean we will all define liberty in exactly the same way, or follow the same precise path to happiness,\u201d he said. \u201cProgress does not compel us to settle centuries-long debates about the role of government for all time \u2013 but it does require us to act in our time.\u201d A deep partisan divide in Washington and the country characterized Obama\u2019s first term, with Congress seemingly paralyzed at times and repeated episodes of brinksmanship over debt and spending issues bringing the first-ever downgrade of the U.S. credit rating. Acknowledging the political rift, Obama called for leaders and citizens to work for the greater good of the country. \u201cWe cannot mistake absolutism for principle, or substitute spectacle for politics, or treat name-calling as reasoned debate,\u201d he said. \u201cWe must act, knowing that our work will be imperfect.\u201d At the same time, he made clear he would fight for the central themes of his election campaign. \u201cFor we, the people, understand that our country cannot succeed when a shrinking few do very well and a growing many barely make it,\u201d he said. While \u201cwe must make the hard choices to reduce the cost of health care and the size of our deficit,\u201d he said, \u201cwe reject the belief that America must choose between caring for the generation that built this country and investing in the generation that will build its future.\u201d Text of speech In particular, he defended the need for popular entitlement programs that provide government benefits to senior citizens, the poor and the disabled, saying they were part of the American fabric. \u201cThe commitments we make to each other \u2013 through Medicare, and Medicaid, and Social Security \u2013 these things do not sap our initiative; they strengthen us,\u201d Obama said. \u201cThey do not make us a nation of takers; they free us to take the risks that make this country great.\u201d On Monday, Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell, one of Obama\u2019s harshest critics, called the president\u2019s second term \u201ca fresh start when it comes to dealing with the great challenges of our day; particularly, the transcendent challenge of unsustainable federal spending and debt.\u201d Other issues also appear difficult, if not intractable. Obama made a reference to gun control, saying that the nation needed to ensure that \u201call our children, from the streets of Detroit to the hills of Appalachia to the quiet lanes of Newtown, know that they are cared for, and cherished, and always safe from harm.\u201d However, congressional Republicans and some Democrats, as well as the powerful gun lobby, have rejected proposals Obama recently announced in response to the Connecticut school shootings that killed 20 Newtown first-graders last month. In citing climate change as a priority, Obama raised the profile of the issue on the national agenda after a presidential campaign in which it was almost never mentioned. \u201cWe will respond to the threat of climate change, knowing that the failure to do so would betray our children and future generations,\u201d he said, warning of a \u201clong and sometimes difficult\u201d path to sustainable energy sources in a nation dominated by its fossil fuel industries such as oil and coal. \u201cAmerica cannot resist this transition; we must lead it,\u201d Obama said. \u201cWe cannot cede to other nations the technology that will power new jobs and new industries \u2013 we must claim its promise.\u201d Obama infused his speech with references to two assassinated American icons \u2013 President Abraham Lincoln and civil rights leader Martin Luther King Jr. In one passage, Obama cited \u201cblood drawn by lash and blood drawn by sword\u201d in mentioning the Civil War and slavery. It mimicked Lincoln\u2019s second inaugural address in 1865, when he spoke of the possibility that \u201cevery drop of blood drawn with the lash shall be paid by another drawn the sword.\u201d Of King, Obama referred to those who came to Washington almost 50 years ago \u201cto hear a preacher say that we cannot walk alone; to hear a King proclaim that our individual freedom is inextricably bound to the freedom of every soul on Earth.\u201d The inauguration coincided with the national holiday honoring King. The president concluded by urging Americans to fulfill their responsibility as citizens by meeting \u201cthe obligation to shape the debates of our time \u2013 not only with the votes we cast, but with the voices we lift in defense of our most ancient values and enduring ideals.\u201d At a little more than 2,100 words, Obama\u2019s speech was about 300 shorter than his first inaugural address four years earlier. In 2009, he was fresh off his historic election as the nation\u2019s first African-American president, facing an economic recession, wars in Iraq and Afghanistan and the ongoing terrorist threat. David Maraniss, author of the book \u201cBarack Obama: The Story,\u201d said the difference from four years ago was palpable, adding: \u201cI could feel his heart beating this time.\u201d EARLIER: Top 5 inaugural addresses CNN\u2019s Dana Bash and Matt Smith contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "House Speaker John Boehner says he won't negotiate legislation with the president Zelizer: House GOP won't acknowledge Obama's mandate, Boehner not in control of caucus Navarrette: Obama needs to stop practicing \"defiance politics,\" needs to lead Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell could be instrumental in upcoming battles If all the recent wrangling over the fiscal cliff has revealed anything, it\u2019s how tense and strained President Obama\u2019s relationship is with Republicans in Congress. Borger: Fiscal cliff was bound to collapse And Obama\u2019s relationship with Congress reached yet another low Thursday when House Speaker John Boehner confirmed to CNN that he has told House Republicans he will no longer negotiate legislative deals with the president. And in an opinion piece on Thursday, Sen. John Cornyn of Texas faulted the president for all the fiscal brinksmanship since 2010. The new No. 2 Senate Republican also suggested that \u201c[i]t may be necessary to partially shut down the government in order to secure the long-term fiscal well being of our country.\u201d Low bar for new Congress In the White House\u2019s relationship with Capitol Hill, \u201cthe real negative is clearly that the relationship with House Republicans is as bad as ever,\u201d CNN contributor and Princeton University historian Julian Zelizer said, adding that the House GOP refuses to acknowledge any mandate from Obama after November\u2019s election. Warning: dangerous cliffs ahead Boehner chokes up during opening speech Obama refuses to debate GOP on debt Avlon, Hoover discuss Biden & McConnell \u201cThey are going to fight the president tooth and nail,\u201d Zelizer said, a problem made worse by the fact that Boehner \u201cis not in control\u201d of House Republicans, particularly the contingent of fiscal conservatives brought to Washington by support from the tea party movement. Zelizer: GOP faces choice \u2013 leadership or gridlock? CNN contributor Ruben Navarrette Jr. said Obama\u2019s strained relationship with congressional Republicans dates back to the contentious debate over Obama\u2019s signature health care legislation, where the president showed his willingness to push through major proposals and major legislation without consulting them. \u201cHe is so good at the business of politics that he\u2019s really outmaneuvered them,\u201d Navarrette observed about Obama\u2019s relationship with Republicans over the past four years. Navarrette: The real issue is runaway spending The already difficult relationship isn\u2019t helped by unique issues on each side. The GOP has been struggling to define itself and its message in tough economic times amidst twin concerns about government spending and income inequality. Zelizer: What the tea party cost the GOP And buoyed by his electoral success in 2008, legislative successes in the first half of his first term and by winning a second term, Obama adopted a take-it-or-leave-it attitude with Republicans, even as the nation teetered on the edge of the fiscal cliff. Blackburn: 'Era of backroom deals over' McCain predicts battle over debt ceiling Obama thanks Biden for 'great work' Obama: 'Not how it's going to work' \u201cMy preference would have been to solve these problems in the context of a larger agreement, a bigger deal, a grand bargain. But with this Congress, that was obviously a little too much to hope for at this time,\u201d Obama said Monday afternoon at a White House event that at moments seemed like a campaign gathering. At the same event, Obama also warned the GOP about expected battles over spending cuts in the coming months. \u201cNow, if Republicans think that I will finish the job of deficit reduction through spending cuts alone,\u201d Obama said, \u201c[I]f they think that\u2019s going to be the formula for how we solve this thing, then they\u2019ve got another thing coming. That\u2019s not how it\u2019s going to work.\u201d Rather, Obama declared \u201cit\u2019s going to have to be a matter of shared sacrifice, at least as long as I\u2019m president. And I\u2019m going to be president for the next four years.\u201d Obama\u2019s recent post-election trash talking directed at Congress is \u201cdefiance politics\u201d that misunderstands what it means to win an election, Navarrette said. The president\u2019s recent comments are like \u201can end zone dance, a celebration\u201d or, in the world of mixed martial arts competition, like \u201cputting your foot on the other guy\u2019s neck and holding your hand up in the air,\u201d after you\u2019ve felled your opponent, according to Navarrette. Instead of taking every opportunity to remind Republicans that he won (and they lost) last November, Obama needs to realize that \u201cwith winning elections comes the responsibility to lead,\u201d Navarrette said.  As the person in whom the public has placed its trust and confidence, \u201cyour burdens are much greater (than your losing opponent\u2019s).\u201d Democrats counter that Obama hasn\u2019t had anyone to make a deal with. \u201cWhen John Boehner comes to the table and he can\u2019t even bring his deputy or his third in command to vote for the deal that he is agreeing to, I think you\u2019ve got a real crisis of leadership in the House,\u201d former White House press secretary Bill Burton said. Debt Ceiling: Welcome to Fight Club \u201cAnd so the president showed that even in that case, he can get a deal that moves the ball forward for the country, but going forward, you just wonder, how much control does Boehner have over the folks in the House and what kind of deals are we going to be able to get?\u201d For all his recent public swagger when it comes to Congress, Obama \u201creally does compromise a lot,\u201d said Zelizer. For example, Zelizer pointed out that during recent negotiations over the fiscal cliff, the president changed his position substantially on the income threshold for eliminating the Bush tax cuts. While he says he doesn\u2019t think there\u2019s much more Obama can do publicly to smooth over the differences with House Republicans, Zelizer said that Obama can\u2019t let stand Boehner\u2019s declaration that he\u2019s abandoning any more legislative deal-making with the White House. The president would be wise to try to work behind the scenes to keep Boehner \u201cin the fold and maintain some sort of relationship\u201d with the speaker. And Zelizer noted an encouraging pattern in the recent fiscal brinksmanship between Congress and the president. After negotiations between Boehner and Obama broke down, \u201c(Senate Minority Leader Mitch) McConnell stepped up and put the deal together,\u201d observed Zelizer, who added the Senate could take the lead again in working out agreements on things like handling automatic spending cuts put off by this week\u2019s fiscal cliff deal and likely upcoming battles over the debt ceiling and funding the federal government. Zelizer noted that after McConnell negotiated a deal with Vice President Joe Biden, Boehner allowed House Republicans to entertain an alternative that would have included more spending cuts, an alternative which never made it to a vote because fiscal conservatives couldn\u2019t muster a majority in the House GOP to support its passage. Ultimately, Boehner kept his pledge to Democratic leaders in Congress to put the Senate\u2019s deal up for a House vote. By making the pledge before the terms of the Senate deal were even set, Zelizer said, Boehner sent a signal to House Republicans that they were going to lose the battle over the fiscal cliff even if they didn\u2019t like the Senate deal. The maneuvers by McConnell and Boehner suggest a path forward if repeated, according to Zelizer, because if GOP leaders continue not to obstruct Democrats as they try to move forward with legislation, that could help bring around tea party Republicans in the House. Tea party calls for consequences after fiscal cliff vote In order to improve their relationship with the White House, Navarette said Republicans \u201chave to fix what\u2019s broken in their own party, they have to heal the divisions in their own party \u2026 and define what the GOP is about.\u201d Boehner re-elected speaker in midst of public defections Calling it \u201ca miracle\u201d that Boehner was re-elected as speaker, Navarette said the GOP must also decide which role it wants to play in Obama\u2019s second term. Will they try to be accommodating and try to work with the president to find solutions to problems, including some problems Republican donors and the Republican establishment wants fixed? Or will they play the proverbial loyal opposition? Both are \u201cnot terribly attractive options\u201d for the GOP, Navarette said, especially up against a masterful political strategist like Obama. And Navarrette suggests that the sports-loving and competitive Obama invite top Republicans over to the White House for his annual Super Bowl watching party in order to build personal relationships across the aisle in Congress. For Obama, moderating his triumphal, defiant approach when it comes to Republicans and Congress is also important because, Navarette points out, gun control and immigration reform are both high on Obama\u2019s second term agenda. And there are strong feelings on the part of conservatives and Obama\u2019s liberal base on both issues. Politics in 2013: 5 things to watch for Obama talks about \u2018worst day of my presidency,\u2019 goals for next term On the fiscal issues where Obama has repeatedly clashed with Capitol Hill Republicans in the past two years, Zelizer warns that recent events could repeat themselves. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be rough, going to be tough, we\u2019re going to see this issue recur again and again over the years,\u201d the historian said. Indeed, both Obama and McConnell, the GOP\u2019s new lead fiscal negotiator, already seem to be playing out a familiar script. 3 more fiscal cliffs loom The last fiscal battle barely over, Obama wasted no time late Tuesday night staking out his position in the battles to come. After saying \u201cI am very open to compromise,\u201d the president went on to fire a shot over Congress\u2019 bow in the likely fight in February over raising the debt ceiling.  \u201c[W]hile I will negotiate over many things, I will not have another debate with this Congress over whether or not they should pay the bills that they\u2019ve already racked up through the laws that they passed,\u201d Obama declared, \u201cLet me repeat: We can\u2019t not pay bills that we\u2019ve already incurred.\u201d McConnell quickly fired back. \u201cThe president may not want to have a fight about government spending over the next few months, but it\u2019s the fight he is going to have, because it\u2019s a debate the country needs,\u201d McConnell wrote in a Yahoo op-ed published Wednesday night, adding that Obama \u201cmust show up\u201d and deliver a serious plan for slashing federal spending. \u201cThat\u2019s the debate the American people really want. It\u2019s a debate Republicans are ready to have. And it\u2019s the debate that starts today, whether the president wants it or not,\u201d McConnell wrote. Although he has sworn off direct negotiations with Obama, Boehner echoed McConnell\u2019s remarks on Friday. \u201cWith the cliff behind us, the focus turns to spending,\u201d Boehner told House Republicans.

            "article_content": "NEW: John Boehner re-elected House speaker; says U.S. debt must be tamed The fiscal cliff was averted, but issues like the the sequester and debt ceiling await Congress will vote on scaled-back aid to Superstorm Sandy victims on Friday Democrats gain seats in both chambers, but Republicans keep control of the House The bar has never been lower for the nearly 100 freshmen of the 113th Congress who were sworn-in on Thursday. After all, it won\u2019t take much to exceed the abysmal approval rating of the previous Congress. Despite the usual burst optimism of a freshman class on Capitol Hill and the sentiment to reach across the aisle and dissolve partisan gridlock, recent history shows those pledges are destined to falter like so many New Year\u2019s resolutions. \u201cOn the day people are sworn in they are entitled to dream,\u201d said Larry Sabato, director of the University of Virginia\u2019s Center for Politics. \u201cThe idea that they are going to bridge the unbridgeable gap between the two parties is indeed a dream.\u201d Obama signs fiscal cliff bill into law The new Congress faces many of the same stubborn issues that make bipartisanship in a politically divided country difficult to achieve. Although Washington averted the worst aspects of the fiscal cliff earlier this week, the automatic spending cuts, or sequester, that were a centerpiece of that debate for months but cut out of the final deal at the last minute are coming around again in February. At about the same time, lawmakers will have to consider raising the nation\u2019s debt ceiling, or the ability of the Treasury to borrow money to pay the nation\u2019s bills. Both sides are already digging in on spending and debt. Are days of Congress \u2018going big\u2019 over? Latino Congress members set record U.S. Congress forgets Superstorm Sandy Quinn on Congress not voting for relief Christie: Boehner wouldn't take my calls A fresh controversy involves assistance to victims of Superstorm Sandy. An aid bill approved by the Senate was shelved on Tuesday night by House Speaker John Boehner over concerns that voting on a big spending package immediately after approving a fiscal cliff deal that excluded deficit reduction would send a bad political signal. New York and New Jersey politicians were incensed at Boehner\u2019s inaction, prompting New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie to growl: that this is \u201cwhy the American people hate Congress.\u201d A scaled-back version of $9 billion for immediate aid for flood insurance will be considered by both houses on Friday. Lawmakers will weigh the balance of the $60 billion plan later this month. Furor over dropped vote for Sandy aid defused Further out on the horizon is an expected fight over gun control, a high priority for the White House in the aftermath of the Connecticut school massacre that will face push-back from congressional members with high ratings and big-dollar donations from gun rights advocates. Immigration reform, another White House priority, will also stoke ideological differences and test the demographic shifts in Congress. All in all, the sharp divisions on Capitol Hill are still evident and expectations for meaningful progress on substantive issues are not high. \u201cMy sense is that things are not going to be that different because the fundamental divisions that existed in the previous Congress are still there,\u201d said Alan Abramowitz, a political science professor at Emory University. New faces on Capitol Hill \u201cWe still have a Democratic Senate and Republican House. We still have a divided Congress. The ideological divisions between the parties are as great as they were in the last Congress,\u201d he said. The divide is widened by a continued attrition of moderates, who lost or retired from seats on both sides of the aisle in both chambers. But on the other side of the question there have been subtle shifts in numbers and other changes that could make a difference in how votes on some issues play out, political experts say. Republicans retained control of the House in November but Democrats gained seats there and expanded their control of the Senate. Republicans now fill 234 seats in the new House, down from 242. There are 201 House Democrats, up from 193. In the Senate, voters handed two former GOP seats to Democrats for a new balance of 55-45. The 55 Democratic seats include two independents who caucus with the party. Kirk makes emotional return after stroke For the first time, the House Democratic caucus is dominated by women and racial minorities, while the Republican caucus in that chamber is largely composed of white men. Over in the Senate, 20 women \u2014 the largest number in history \u2014 will be sworn in. The increased diversity \u201cmeans that we reflect America more,\u201d said newly elected Illinois Democrat Rep. Tammy Duckworth. \u201cYou know the district where I come from is a very diverse district, and it is good to see Congress starting to look more like the rest of America. And you see the demographic shifts that are happening across the country.\u201d Partisanship remains strong, however, political experts say. \u201cThose things are interesting and it\u2019s a good thing to have that diversity \u2026 but just that party attached to the person\u2019s name explains the roll call. It doesn\u2019t matter the race or the gender. It\u2019s the party affiliation,\u201d Sabato said. Boehner, whose relationship with President Barack Obama frayed further during the fiscal cliff negotiations, received the gavel again on Thursday when he was re-elected to lead the chamber. While 220 of the 234 House Republicans voted for the Ohio lawmaker, a few members didn\u2019t answer, simply voted \u201cpresent,\u201d or cast ballots for other candidates. Following the fiscal cliff fight, Boehner is telling colleagues no more negotiating deals and that \u201cregular order works best\u201d from now on. Boehner also signaled the upcoming debt showdown in remarks following his re-election, saying that taming debt was the most important thing for restoring long-term U.S. economic health. \u201cAt $16 trillion and rising, our national debt is draining free enterprise and weakening the ship of state. The American Dream is in peril so long as its namesake is weighed down by this anchor of debt. Break its hold, and we begin to set our economy free,\u201d he said. Boehner, under fire from some conservatives, re-elected speaker Obama had stern words for the 113th Congress, warning lawmakers that he will not tolerate the kind of prolonged brinksmanship that defined the fiscal cliff saga. \u201cWhile I will negotiate over many things, I will not have another debate with this Congress over whether or not they should pay the bills that they\u2019ve already racked up through the laws that they\u2019ve passed,\u201d he said shortly after the House passed the fiscal cliff bill. Obama calls for less \u2018drama,\u2019 \u2018brinkmanship\u2019 Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell responded sharply in an opinion piece for Yahoo News, insisting that spending would be part of the debate over the debt ceiling. The incoming freshman class took notes on failures of the previous Congress in hopes of avoiding a repeat performance. Incoming freshmen \u201clearned a lot from what happened over the last few weeks with the fiscal cliff debacle,\u201d freshman Texas Democrat Rep. Joaquin Castro said on CNN, adding that the takeaway for a lot of his class is to strengthen bipartisan ties. \u201cA lot of us come in with that mind frame,\u201d he said. McConnell: Debt debate \u2018starts today\u2019 CNN\u2019s Josh Levs, Tom Watkins, Holly Yan, Robert Yoon and Ashley Killough contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Eric Garcetti, a city councilman, would be the city's first Jewish mayor Wendy Greuel, the city controller, would be the first woman mayor They both have worked in Hollywood Their seesaw race has become heated over union campaign spending Voters in the nation\u2019s second-largest city will elect a new mayor Tuesday in a race that will make history and offer a possible indicator on public sentiment toward unions representing municipal employees during a budget crisis. Incumbent Antonio Villaraigosa, the first Latino mayor here in more than 130 years, is stepping down after eight years because of term limits. Tuesday\u2019s faceoff is between City Councilman Eric Garcetti and City Controller Wendy Greuel. Both are longtime political players in Los Angeles. Here are four things you should know about them and the election, where polls show a seesaw battle. Making history Either candidate will make City Hall history with a victory. Greuel, 51, would be the first woman mayor. \u201cTogether, we\u2019ll get one step closer to breaking one more glass ceiling and electing our city\u2019s first woman mayor,\u201d her website tells voters. Garcetti, 42, would be the first Jewish mayor. Garcetti\u2019s mother is Jewish, and his father, Gil, the former district attorney whose office lost in the OJ Simpson murder trial in the 1990s, is of Mexican and Italian descent. \u201cI always felt myself to be Jewish and Latino very comfortably,\u201d Garcetti told the Jewish Journal. \u201cWeekends were both filled with bowls of menudo and lots of bagels.\u201d But it may be Los Angeles\u2019 vast Latino demographic that could swing an election in which voter turnout is projected to be low. In the homestretch, both candidates have been scrambling to capture the Latino bloc, highlighting their ties to the community and launching attack ads against each other. Hispanics make up 45% of the city\u2019s population and almost a third of the electorate, and their influence was widely viewed as evident with the history-setting election of Villaraigosa. Greuel has highlighted her ties to Latino leaders, and Garcetti touts his grandparents from Mexico. The attack ads, however, are painting a different picture. Garcetti is portrayed as wearing a Latino mask and displacing Hispanic families during the revitalization of Hollywood, an area Garcetti represents as councilman. Greuel registered as a Republican in the early 1990s when the California governor was Republican Pete Wilson, who is reviled by Latinos for backing  Proposition 187 that denied  certain government benefits to undocumented immigrants. The courts struck down most of that initiative. Greuel said she opposed Proposition 187. In the closing days of the election, Garcetti had a seven-point lead over Greuel, according to a USC Price School of Public Policy/Los Angeles Times poll released Friday. Garcetti was leading among Latino voters (53% to 43%), but Greuel was leading among black voters (48% to 25%). Surprisingly, however, Garcetti also was leading among women voters, despite Greuel\u2019s historic quest: 47% to 43%, the poll said. Still, the poll found, \u201cgender was the top reason given when voters were asked about their support of Greuel. Among Greuel supporters, 13% said they are voting for her because she is a woman and \u2018we need a female mayor,\u2019\u201d pollsters said. Lights, camera, action! Both candidates are lifelong Angelenos with extensive political resumes. But what sets them apart from mayoral candidates in other major cities is that both boast of having worked in Hollywood. Perhaps that\u2019s not too surprising in the nation\u2019s entertainment capital. Starting in 1997, Greuel worked in the film industry for five years at DreamWorks, where she worked beside director Steven Spielberg and Hollywood mavens Jeffrey Katzenberg and David Geffen. Greuel was a studio liaison to the government sector and organized political fundraisers for the three founders of DreamWorks. For his part in showbiz, Garcetti appeared in cameo roles in such productions as \u201cAll My Children\u201d and even played a fictional mayor on television. He also is a member of the Screen Actors Guild, he says. Both candidates are touting those sensitivities to Hollywood as the entertainment industry in Los Angeles has been facing stiff competition from outside the state, enhanced by tax incentives or lower costs. The Los Angeles job base thrives partly on Hollywood productions staying local. Obama-Clinton Part II California, a Democratic stronghold, was a major battleground between Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton in the 2008 Democratic presidential primary. Villaraigosa put all his chips on Clinton and endorsed her. In this month\u2019s election on his successor, Villaraigosa isn\u2019t extending an endorsement, though he has lamented the recent negative turn in campaign ads. Clinton won the California primary, but Obama went on to win the presidency. Political observers are casting Greuel and Garcetti as modern-day proxies of that Clinton-Obama rivalry. Greuel supported Clinton in the 2008 race. In fact, Greuel worked in the presidential administration of her husband former President Bill Clinton, who is endorsing her in this month\u2019s race. Garcetti was one of five co-chairpersons for Obama\u2019s 2008 campaign in California. Bill Clinton has been visible in his support of Greuel; Obama has refrained from weighing in on the race because the candidates are both Democrats. Despite the two candidates\u2019 Democratic credentials, Garcetti is viewed as more conservative, if his support among conservative voters is any indication. The USC/Los Angeles Times poll found Garcetti with a 21-point lead among conservative voters: He led Greuel 54% to 33%. Curiously, he was leading her in other parts of the political spectrum, too, but with smaller margins: Garcetti was ahead 45 to 44 among moderates and 50 to 43 among liberals, the poll said. In fact, Garcetti was leading Greuel on her home turf in the San Fernando Valley, 47% to 43%, the poll said. The USC/Los Angeles Times survey reveals a quick change in fortunes for the two candidates. A week before that poll, Greuel and Garcetti were in a virtual tie, according to the Edmund G. \u201cPat\u201d Brown Institute of Public Affairs at California State University, Los Angeles. The electorate gave the institute a vivid assessment of the two candidates. \u201cMore voters say that Garcetti, by a slight margin, will be the better candidate in providing leadership and fighting crime, while voters prefer Greuel for handling education and as a candidate who \u2018cares about people like me,\u2019\u201d the institute said. \u201cThe most cited negative by likely voters against Greuel is that she is too close to special interests and unions, and the most noted criticism of Garcetti is that he cannot be trusted,\u201d the institute added. Union clout Among the biggest issues in the mayoral race is the role of unions and their campaign spending. Greuel is receiving big financial support from unions representing city employees. Most of those unions have put their money on her, including about $1.5 million from the local representing workers at the city\u2019s Department of Water and Power. The cost of city jobs are part of the budget crisis that awaits the new mayor, who will have to help negotiate salary agreements with the water department, police, fire, and other city employees. To help the city balance its budget, Garcetti has backed layoffs, furloughs and an increase in the retirement age for new city workers. A few unions have endorsed Garcetti, but their money is a fraction of what Greuel has received. Greuel has criticized Garcetti for proposing draconian measures against labor. In response, Garcetti calls his opponent \u201cthe DWP\u2019s mayor\u201d and asks voters: \u201cHow much will it cost you?\u201d Voters will render their verdict on the two candidates on Tuesday.",

            "article_content": "Obama takes a cultural tour of an ancient city before returning to Washington In a last-minute move,  Netanyahu calls Turkey to make an apology -- on Obama's initiative Jordan has 460,000 Syrian refugees with more coming, King Abdullah says U.S. President Barack Obama wraps up his trip to the Middle East on Saturday with a walking tour of the ancient city of Petra in Jordan. The city\u2019s breathtaking architecture features buildings partly carved into stone cliffs and combines eastern culture with ancient Greek constructions. It is a UNESCO world heritage site. Shortly after a stroll through arid the landscape renowned for its colorful interplay of light and shadow, the president will return to Washington, DC. A last minute success Just before departing for Jordan on Friday, Obama scored a diplomatic coup when Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu apologized to Turkey for a 2010 commando raid that killed nine activists on a Turkish vessel in a Gaza-bound flotilla. The apology, long sought by Turkish Prime Minister Recep Erdogan, eased strained feelings between Turkey and Israel, two vital U.S. allies in the Middle East. It happened in a phone call to Erdogan during a final meeting between Obama and Netanyahu at an international airport in Tel Aviv, minutes before Air Force One departed for Jordan to complete the president\u2019s Middle East swing. Obama hailed the development as an important step forward for both countries. Jordan\u2019s refugee influx Friday in Jordan, Obama focused on the civil war in neighboring Syria, with King Abdullah telling reporters that the conflict has caused 460,000 refugees to flood his country and more were on the way. That equals 10% of Jordan\u2019s population, and the total could double by the end of the year, the king said in asking for more help from the international community as his country also deals with internal reforms in response to economic woes that are raising public dissatisfaction. Obama said he was working with Congress to provide an additional $200 million to Jordan this year to help deal with the refugee influx, but he remained steadfast in his refusal to pledge U.S. military assistance to the Syrian opposition movement. Refugees flood Jordan town However, Obama repeated past warnings that his stance on military involvement could change if the Syria uses chemical weapons. Jordan is suffering from refugee fatigue.  Masses of people have fled there for from neighboring countries whenever conflict was rife. The Syrian conflict comes on top of the flood of refugees that came from Iraq just a decade ago. The country is a close U.S. ally and has been one of the most stable in the region, but it has seen recent internal turmoil and discontent. King Abdullah has a reputation for benevolence, unlike autocratic rulers such as Syria\u2019s Bashar al-Assad or deposed Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein. One house of the Jordanian parliament is democratically elected. However, a bad economy and allegations of corruption by public officials have stoked dissatisfaction with him. In November, crowds took to the streets calling for King Abdullah\u2019s downfall because of rising gasoline prices. More recently, comments attributed to King Abdullah in the The Atlantic caused further anger toward the king, who was quoted as calling the opposition Muslim Brotherhood a \u201cMasonic cult\u201d and referring to tribal elders in his country as \u201cold dinosaurs.\u201d The royal court says some of King Abdullah\u2019s comments in the Atlantic Magazine article were taken out of context by local Jordanian and international media outlets who reported on the article. Courting Israel In Israel, the last-minute diplomacy added a flourish to Obama\u2019s first visit to the Jewish state as president. While the two nations have a key strategic partnership, with the United States supplying military aid and diplomatic support as Israel\u2019s most vital ally, Obama and Netanyahu had famously frosty relations during the president\u2019s first term. With both beginning new terms after Obama\u2019s re-election last year and Netanyahu\u2019s recent formation of a new government, the president\u2019s visit was an opportunity to reset the relationship and signal unified positions on major issues such as the Middle East peace process and Iran\u2019s efforts to develop a nuclear weapon. Obama and Netanyahu met several times during the president\u2019s three days in Israel, which also included a state dinner where Israeli President Shimon Peres awarded him the country\u2019s highest civilian honor. Read: Obama goes over Netanyahu\u2019s head to the Israeli people Before leaving Israel, Obama paid tribute to the father of modern Zionism in a symbolic visit to Theodor Herzl\u2019s grave. Joined by Peres, Netanyahu and U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry, Obama also visited the grave of former Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin, who was assassinated in 1995. Obama placed a stone at each grave from the grounds of the Martin Luther King Jr. memorial in Washington in a gesture to link the African-American struggle for freedom with the struggle by the Israeli people for a homeland. Obama: Israel 'at a crossroads' President Obama in the West Bank Tensions high as Obama visits region The president also visited the Holocaust memorial Yad Vashem, where he turned up the \u201ceternal flame\u201d of remembrance of the millions of Jewish victims of Nazi death camps in World War II. Read: Obama, Netanyahu offer unified stance on Iran Fairness for the Palestinians In Israel, Obama urged young Israelis in a speech to pressure their leaders to seek peace with Palestinians. He asked Israelis to empathize with the plight of Palestinians, and he drew applause when he criticized the Israeli government\u2019s controversial policy of building new settlements in disputed territories. Walking through Ramallah and Gaza, political differences become real During a visit with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas in Ramallah, the West Bank, Obama stressed the need for direct talks between Israelis and Palestinians for a two-state solution. \u201cThe Palestinian people deserve an end to occupation and the daily indignities that come with it,\u201d he said at a news conference with Abbas, adding that Palestinians deserve \u201ca future of hope\u201d and a \u201cstate of their own.\u201d Abbas said the Israeli settlements are \u201cmore than a hurdle to peace,\u201d calling them illegal and saying it was Israel\u2019s duty to stop building them. He envisioned a Palestinian state based on 1967 borders with Jerusalem as capital \u2013 a scenario unacceptable to Israel.

San Diego Mayor Out of Therapy 9th accuser: Filner grabbed my derri\u00e8re Refusing to resign in the face of mounting allegations that he groped and made lewd comments toward numerous women, Filner is facing an effort to recall him from office. And now a city councilman wants him to answer questions about more than $500 in charges on his official city credit card from a downtown hotel. \u201cWhen you see statements like this, it raises the question of is city business being done or not,\u201d Councilman Kevin Faulconer said Tuesday. CNN obtained Filner\u2019s municipal credit-card statements from January to May. The taxpayer-paid card included charges ranging from less than $30 to about $111 at the Westgate Hotel, including one incurred on a Sunday. The Westgate is across the street from the mayor\u2019s office. Regulars at the bar who did not want to speak on-camera told CNN that Filner was often here, usually with a different woman. Faulconer, a Republican who sits on the council\u2019s audit committee, raised questions about other charges as well \u2013 $3,000 to an online reputation-management firm, $128 for a juicer and a $30,000 trip to Paris. He said Filner has promised to reimburse the city for that trip, but there has been no proof of a refund. Secrets that women of San Diego no longer keep about its mayor The 70-year-old Filner was elected mayor of the eighth-largest American city in 2012, after 10 terms in Congress. His accusers range from a singer at a campaign fundraiser to his former communications director, who called him unfit for office. He\u2019s rebuffed calls to resign from all nine City Council members and from his fellow Democrats, including California\u2019s two U.S. senators. He now faces a recall effort that is trying to gather more than 100,000 signatures needed to put his future up to a new vote, though some political observers doubt organizers can succeed. Filner issued a required response to the notice of a petition drive Tuesday, arguing that voters should weigh his administration\u2019s push for new parks, high-tech jobs, better roads and a 2024 Olympic bid before they decide to whether they want to turn him out of office. \u201cNow is not the time to go backwards \u2013 back to the time when middle-class jobs and neighborhood infrastructure were sacrificed to downtown special interests,\u201d Filner said in a written response to a proposed recall petition. \u201cWe need to continue to move forward!\u201d Did mayor target victims of military sexual assault? But Michael Pallamary, the head of the recall effort, said Filner \u201cobviously believes his policy initiatives excuse his being a sexual predator.\u201d \u201cHis reply is unacceptable,\u201d Pallamary said. \u201cSan Diegans want a mayor that doesn\u2019t grope and demean women, who doesn\u2019t abuse his office to satisfy a perverted quest for a sense of power, and who has the ability to lead our great city \u2013 an ability Filner can never, ever reclaim.\u201d Filner has brought \u201cgreat shame\u201d on the city, Pallamary said, vowing, \u201cWe will recall him from office.\u201d In July, Filner acknowledged that he \u201cfailed to fully respect the women who work for me and with me\u201d and that he was \u201cembarrassed\u201d by his actions. But he also said he will be vindicated by \u201ca full presentation of the facts\u201d and he will not resign. \u201cWe have moved toward the vision of producing thousands of middle-class jobs in our port; creating a solar-based city to enhance our environment and create jobs; building an efficient international border to bring billions of dollars into our economy; keeping our military and hi-tech sectors strong and vibrant,\u201d Filner said in response to the recall petition notice. He touted new support for the arts, a five-year labor agreement with city workers and work toward bringing the summer Olympics to the city. Out of rehab, but also locked out of office The mayor entered a two-week intensive behavior therapy program on July 29, but his attorney, James Payne, said Filner was able to complete that phase of treatment by Saturday. He\u2019ll continue with outpatient treatment, Payne said \u2013 but he might not be back at work in his office anytime soon. His chief of staff changed the locks, according to numerous reports, including one by CNN affiliate KFMB. And after weeks of complaints, some observers are questioning whether more should have been said about Filner\u2019s behavior before last year\u2019s election. \u201cI think there was a lot of whispering,\u201d former state Assemblywoman Lori Saldana told CNN. \u201cIt was a lot of things under the surface. A lot of \u2018boys will be boys.\u2019 \u201d Saldana said she brought complaints about Filner to San Diego County\u2019s Democratic Party leader two years ago after hearing accounts of harassing behavior from six women. Nothing happened, she said. \u201cIt was considered abusive. It was insulting at times. And I think people need to pay attention to those reports, and it didn\u2019t happen two years ago,\u201d said Saldana, also a Democrat. Filner\u2019s 2012 opponent, City Councilman Carl DeMaio, hinted at the issue during a mayoral debate. Video of the event shows DeMaio telling voters, \u201cYou need a mayor who\u2019s going to insist on zero tolerance of sexual harassment in the workplace\u201d \u2013 turning to look at Filner while he makes the comment. DeMaio is now running for Congress and had no comment. But his mayoral campaign featured a television spot in which an Washington airport worker who had a run-in with Filner described his actions as \u201cscary and hostile.\u201d \u201cI deal with frustrated travelers every day, but I never came across anyone like Bob Filner,\u201d she said.

            "article_content": "The Pine Ridge Indian Reservation in South Dakota votes to lift an alcohol ban The decades-old ban stirs debate among members of the Oglala Sioux tribe If the ban is lifted, stores can open on the reservation, taking business from a nearby town An Indian reservation in South Dakota voted to repeal a decades-old ban on alcohol, according to preliminary results announced by the Oglala Sioux Tribe Wednesday. The unofficial tally from Tuesday\u2019s vote at Pine Ridge Indian Reservation shows that 1,645 members voted in favor of lifting the ban, 1,494 voted against and 438 votes were challenged. \u201cChallenge votes are being counted and will be released as soon as they are received from the election committee,\u201d the Oglala Lakota Nation website said. Pine Ridge is the last dry reservation in the state. The debate about allowing alcohol on the reservation divided the community. The ban, in effect for decades, prohibits the possession and consumption of alcohol on the reservation. But the ban wasn\u2019t working, Lawrence Eagle Bull, one of nine Oglala tribal council members who agreed to put the issue to a vote, said before the balloting. Eagle Bull compared the situation to the United States\u2019 Prohibition era. \u201cIt didn\u2019t work then,\u201d he said. \u201cIt created a criminal element.\u201d Others were firm in their commitment to keep the land dry, saying legalizing alcohol would solve nothing. \u201cAlcohol is behind every social problem we have,\u201d said activist and tribe member Olowan Martinez. \u201cIt\u2019s our biggest enemy \u2013 legalizing it won\u2019t solve the problem.\u201d She cites problems such as domestic abuse, assault, rape and unemployment.  She added that drinking is killing the population: \u201cIt\u2019s liquid genocide.\u201d What both sides agree on is that alcohol abuse is common on the reservation and beer is easy to get. The neighboring border town of Whiteclay , Nebraska, is home to fewer than 15 residents but supports four beer stores that manage to sell 11,000 cans of beer a day to their predominately Native American customer base. The reservation has a tribal membership of more than 35,000 people, according to the Oglala Lakota Nation website. Many of those who purchase beer in Whiteclay drink it there and return to the reservation drunk. Other times the beer is smuggled into the reservation. If the vote holds up and the ban is lifted, the tribe would be able to establish its own beer stores on the reservation. Eagle Bull says each district would house one store \u2013 operated by the tribe \u2013 with profits going toward alcohol rehabilitation facilities. In the long term, Eagle Bull said, stores on the reservation could eventually shut down the Whiteclay operations.",

            "article_content": "NEW: FAA to close control towers at some small- and medium-sized airports NEW: White House cancels tours to cut costs Congress must authorize continued government funding by March 27 Both sides say they don't want a partial government shutdown To no one\u2019s surprise, the next Washington political showdown reared its partisan head on Tuesday. Some House Democrats rejected a GOP proposal intended to fund the government through September while maintaining the forced spending cuts that took effect last week but softening their impact. Failure by Congress to approve a government funding measure, known as a continuing resolution, could cause a partial shutdown when current funding authorization expires on March 27. While The White House and congressional leaders signaled they don\u2019t want another fiscal crisis over keeping the government funded like the ones that dominated President Barack Obama\u2019s first term, an administration policy statement indicated the battle over the forced spending cuts will continue. Meanwhile, a new poll indicated the impasse over spending cuts could be hurting Obama and Democrats, but not necessarily helping Republicans. The mandatory, across-the-board cuts to defense and other discretionary government spending \u2013 but not entitlement programs such as Social Security and Medicare \u2013 occurred after Obama and Congress were unable to work out a compromise to replace or avert them. They amount to roughly 9% for a broad range of non-defense programs and 13% for the Pentagon over the remaining seven months of fiscal year 2013. While both sides oppose the government-wide nature of the cuts, with no leeway for shifting funds to protect specific programs, conservatives argue the total amount is a manageable slice in spending while Democrats say it will cause unnecessary harm. The harshest impacts won\u2019t be evident until April at the earliest, but economists and leaders of both parties warn the $85 billion in cuts through fiscal year 2013 will slow the economy and cause pain for many  Americans. On Tuesday, the Federal Aviation Administration notified control tower operators that 173 of the air traffic towers at small- and medium-sized airports would close on April 7 because of the forced spending cuts, known in Washington jargon as sequestration. The towers operated by contractors instead of FAA employees account for less than 6% of commercial airline operations, and closing them would not necessarily result in airport closures. A more immediate impact came on Tuesday when the White House announced it was canceling all tours effective this Saturday and until further notice to cut costs. \u201cUnfortunately, we will not be able to reschedule affected tours,\u201d the White House said. Republicans complain the Obama administration has tried to manipulate the spending cuts to generate public outrage instead of making a good faith effort to implement them in the most effective and least harmful manner possible. White House spokesman Jay Carney responded to such criticism Tuesday, saying he found it \u201cremarkable that those who weeks ago and certainly months ago were decrying sequester as the worst possible thing that could happen now embrace it as a victory.\u201d Last week, the Army sent the first furlough notices for government employees due to the mandatory cuts. The notices warned unions that workers at the Aberdeen Proving Ground in Gunpowder, Maryland, as well as the Corps of Engineers in Walla Walla, Washington, will be forced to stay home without pay one day each week from April 22 through Sept. 21. That translates to a 20% pay cut for five months, the kind of economic hit that Obama and others have warned will harm the nation\u2019s still sluggish recovery from recession. Other impacts outlined by government officials include reduced staffing at airport customs and security checkpoints, resulting in longer lines; a later opening for gates at Yellowstone National Park because of delayed snow plowing to save money, and job cuts at some schools. Susan Smit, a superintendent in Wagner, South Dakota, told an education conference on Monday that her district reduced health benefits and did not re-hire some staff members in anticipation of the reduced federal funding. In addition, military leaders say force readiness will decline if the full impact of sequester \u2013 totaling about $1 trillion over 10 years \u2013 were to take effect. On Tuesday, the commander of U.S. special operations forces told a congressional committee that the spending cuts and the pending need to fund the government for the rest of the fiscal year would mean less money for the military. Adm. William McRaven, who heads the U.S. Special Operations Command, said a new continuing resolution might revert to 2012 spending levels, which would be $1.5 billion less than what was planned for 2013. On top of that would be an additional $900 million in cuts due to sequestration, resulting in \u201cabout a 23% cut from Southern Command\u2019s available resources,\u201d McRaven said. \u201cI think I can manage that with the resources we have,\u201d he told the Senate Armed Services Committee. \u201cBut we are beginning to create a readiness problem if we don\u2019t resolve the (continuing resolution) and/or have an opportunity to manage the sequestration money because I am already cutting 60% of my flying hours back\u201d in the continental United States, as well as reducing future deployments. He described the situation as \u201ckind of a perfect storm of fiscal problem for us.\u201d The forced spending cuts were part of a 2011 law that increased the nation\u2019s borrowing limit. They were intended to be a fiscal cudgel to inspire legislators to compromise on a comprehensive plan to reduce the nation\u2019s chronic federal deficits and debt. However, election-year politics prevented such a compromise, leading to the so-called fiscal cliff at the end of 2012 that resulted in an agreement to stave off pending tax increases for most Americans while allowing rates on top income earners to return to higher levels of the 1990s. The forced spending cuts set to take effect on January 1 were put off until March 1, and the continuing rift over taxes and spending between Democrats and Republicans prevented a deal to avoid their implementation last Friday. Now, both sides are seeking to gain a political advantage over the recurring impasse. \u201cThis is no way to run a government but until the president gets serious about the serious structural spending problem that we have, we\u2019re gonna have to deal with it,\u201d House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, said Tuesday. The Republican-led House is taking up a GOP-proposed continuing resolution this week, Boehner noted, calling on the Democratic-led Senate to act on it quickly to prevent a government shutdown. Under the proposed continuing resolution unveiled Monday by House Appropriations Committee Chairman Hal Rogers, R-Kentucky, total government spending for the fiscal year would adhere to the figure negotiated by Obama and Congress minus the cuts. The proposal would allow Pentagon officials to shift funding to protect top priority programs, and also include provisions to maintain FBI and border security spending. In addition, it includes some political issues, such as prohibiting any spending for transferring terrorism suspects from the Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, detention facility or for renovating a mainland prison to accept such detainees. OMB outline of spending cuts The first response from House Democrats signaled opposition, arguing the Republican measure  would further codify the sequester cuts in spending for this year. \u201cThey\u2019re happy this is happening,\u201d said Rep. Joseph Crowley, D-New York. \u201cYou know, if you want to take ownership of it, this is a good way of taking ownership of the sequester, in my opinion. My intention is to vote \u2018no.\u2019\u201d However, Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid of Nevada and Carney said Tuesday that the funding levels of the House GOP proposal were acceptable. Reid and Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky both said they expected Democrats to make some changes to the House GOP plan, but they expressed optimism that Congress would pass a continuing resolution to prevent any kind of government shutdown. Later, an administration policy statement expressed openness to negotiating with Republicans on the continuing resolution, but made clear the White House will continue fighting to replace the forced cuts with a package of more tax revenue from closed loopholes and alternative spending reductions. Overall, the two sides remain ideologically opposed on how to reduce the nation\u2019s chronic federal deficits and debt. Spending cuts: When they\u2019ll really bite Republicans seek to shrink the size of government to lower costs, while Democrats argue some new tax revenue is necessary to maintain the social safety net that protects the elderly, disabled and impoverished. Shame and blame: Why Washington needs couples therapy Polls show the public is about as politically divided as its leaders. While most Americans support a deficit reduction plan that includes spending cuts and increased revenue, as well as entitlement reforms, there is little agreement on the formula for such a package. A CBS News poll Monday showed that more Americans blame Republicans in Congress than Obama and Democrats for the failure to avert the forced spending cuts, but the gap between the two has narrowed compared to earlier polls by other organizations. According to the survey, 38% blame congressional Republicans and 33% blame Obama and congressional Democrats, with 19% blaming both. Despite the narrowing gap, the results showed a continued negative perception of Republicans. Teachers: How will you be affected? Darrell West, the vice president and director of governance studies at the Brookings Institution, said Republicans \u201chave some good cards to play in this debate.\u201d After last year\u2019s election campaign, in which the main GOP message was to repeal whatever Obama did, Republicans were now \u201cbeing more strategic in how they\u2019re approaching the budget.\u201d \u201cAs opposed to saying no to everything, they are picking and choosing their fights,\u201d West told CNN. Delays in opening Yellowstone To Wendy Schiller, a political science professor at Brown University, Obama\u2019s campaign-style efforts in recent weeks to blame Republicans for the forced spending cuts and inspire public outrage over them proved to be ineffective and misplaced. \u201cWhen people can\u2019t see the damage, they don\u2019t worry about the damage,\u201d Schiller told CNN, later adding: \u201cAmericans did not re-elect President Obama to play the partisan blame game; they re-elected him to run the country, and that is what he should be doing.\u201d Obama\u2019s press conference on spending cuts",

            "article_content": "Republicans seek to soften the impact of spending cuts on the military March 27 will be the next political standoff The harshest impacts of the $85 billion in cuts are not expected until April Before then, Congress must authorize funding to keep the government running Congress returned to work on Monday amid the first full week of forced spending cuts, with President Barack Obama and Republicans sticking to deeply entrenched positions that have caused a series of showdowns manufactured by Washington politics. Most predicted impacts of the $85 billion in cuts that took effect on Friday night \u2013 such as unpaid furloughs for government workers \u2013 won\u2019t be evident until April at the earliest, officials say. But some impacts were already being felt. Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano told reporters that customs lines for passengers arriving from overseas at some international airports over the weekend were longer than usual due to the spending cuts. At New York\u2019s John F. Kennedy International Airport, more than 50 flights had wait times exceeding two hours and 14 were over three hours, according to Jenny Burke, a spokeswoman for Customs and Border Protection. Longer lines at airports due to budget cuts? Cutting the budget, or cutting out? National parks face 'damaging' cuts Baker: Without dollar, we'd be Greece Rep. King: Obama hasn't shown leadership \u201cThese wait times are not typical for this time period, and are related to decreased booth staffing,\u201d Burke told CNN. In Cody, Wyoming, the local chamber of commerce said Yellowstone National Park will delay the opening of its North and West entrances by a week until April 26, and its East, South and Northeast entrances by two weeks until mid-to-late May due to the impact budget cuts will have on snow removal. The delay will cost related businesses several million dollars, according to the group\u2019s estimates. At an education conference in Washington, school superintendents outlined the impact of the federal government\u2019s latest fiscal saga on on their operations, which included job cuts in some cases. Susan Smit, a superintendent in Wagner, South Dakota, said her district prepared last year in anticipation of reduced federal funding. Shame and blame: Why Washington needs couples therapy \u201cWe had to make the cuts,\u201d Smit said, noting that changes included reduced health benefits and staff members who were not rehired. Meanwhile, the partisan rhetoric by both sides seeking to cast blame on the other continued unabated, signaling continued political brinksmanship over tax and spending issues beginning with the March 27 deadline for Congress to authorize funding to run the government until the current fiscal year ends on September 30. In a first salvo by House Republicans on Monday, their proposal for the government funding measure \u2013 known as a continuing resolution \u2013 sought to soften the impact of the spending cuts on defense and security spending. Under the proposal unveiled by House Appropriations Committee Chairman Hal Rogers, R-Kentucky, the total government spending for the fiscal year would adhere to the figure negotiated by Obama and Congress minus the cuts. However, the proposal would allow Pentagon officials to shift funding to protect top priority programs, and also include provisions to maintain FBI and border security spending. In addition, it would prohibit any spending for transferring terrorism suspects from the Guantanamo Bay, Cuba, detention facility or for renovating a mainland prison to accept such detainees \u2013 a political issue rather than a core spending matter. Obama\u2019s new Cabinet picks face big challenges House Speaker John Boehner, the top Republican negotiator on fiscal issues, told NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d in an interview broadcast Sunday that he was \u201chopeful\u201d for a funding agreement to prevent a partial government shutdown on March 27. Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell offered a similar prediction on CNN,  saying, \u201cI believe we\u2019re going to be able to work out passing the continuing resolution later in March on a bipartisan basis through both the House and the Senate.\u201d In reaction to Boehner\u2019s comments, the White House issued a statement that stressed its support for a continuing resolution that is \u201cclean\u201d from unrelated items. It said Congress should act separately to replace the forced spending cuts with alternatives that will be less harmful to the economy. Obama made clear Friday that the current law requires cuts this fiscal year, which are the first installment of about $1 trillion in spending reductions over the next decade, to be reflected in the continuing resolution to fund the government. At his first Cabinet meeting of his second term on Monday, the president warned of impending hardship from the forced spending cuts. \u201cWe\u2019re going to do our best to make sure that our agencies have the support they need to try to make some very difficult decisions, understanding that there are going to be families and communities that are hurting and that this will slow our growth,\u201d Obama said. \u201cIt will mean lower employment in the United States than otherwise would have been, but we can manage through it.\u201d In the NBC interview, Boehner said he was uncertain if the forced cuts \u2013 known in Washington jargon as sequestration \u2013  would hurt the economy, as predicted by Obama, economists and most Democrats and Republicans. OMB outline of spending cuts Boehner argued in a recent op-ed that the cuts would threaten \u201cU.S. national security, thousands of jobs and more,\u201d but he told NBC that \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone quite understands how the sequester is really going to work.\u201d Obama had argued at a news conference on Friday \u2013 a few hours before he signed an order implementing the mandatory cuts \u2013 that any resulting harm to the economy would be the fault of GOP intransigence. \u201cEvery time that we get a piece of economic news over the next month, next two months, next six months, as long as the sequester is in place, we\u2019ll know that that economic news could have been better,\u201d he said then. The two sides remain ideologically opposed on how to reduce the nation\u2019s chronic federal deficits and debt. Republicans seek to shrink the size of government to lower costs, while Democrats argue some new tax revenue is necessary to maintain the social safety net that protects the elderly, disabled and impoverished. Polls show the public is about as politically divided as its leaders. While most Americans support a deficit reduction plan that includes spending cuts and increased revenue, as well as entitlement reforms, there is little agreement on the formula for such a package. In addition, a Pew Research Center poll last week showed that a majority of respondents opposed cuts to 18 of 19 specific areas, sending the message that people don\u2019t want deficit reduction to hurt them personally. \u201cThe American people want the federal government to reduce spending without touching actual programs,\u201d wrote William Galston a senior fellow in governance studies at the Brookings Institution, in a blog post last week. \u201cIs it any wonder that long-term budget cuts have stalled and that even short-term fiscal issues tie Congress up in knots?\u201d Spending cuts: When they\u2019ll really bite Part of the blame rests with political leaders in Congress and the White House failing to level with the American public about what it will take to \u201cwrestle the federal budget back on a sustainable trajectory for the long term,\u201d Galston wrote. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to avoid the conclusion that most of today\u2019s politicians regard the people with a mixture of fear and contempt: They can\u2019t stand the truth, and they\u2019ll punish any elected official who utters it,\u201d he continued. \u201cWhen politicians come to believe this, or act as though they do, effective democratic self-government becomes impossible, and temporizing and pandering fill the vacuum the absence of serious governance creates.\u201d Such a vacuum exists now, judging by the repeated brinksmanship over tax and spending issues in recent years that caused a downgrade in the U.S. credit rating and threatened economic recovery. Teachers: How will you be affected? A series of showdowns has occurred since a conservative wave helped Republicans regain control of the House in the 2010 mid-term elections. Every deadline \u2013 for funding the government, raising the nation\u2019s borrowing limit or addressing expiring taxes or tax cuts \u2013 led to protracted wrangling and last-minute agreements. One of those past agreements \u2013 to increase the debt ceiling in 2011\u2013 included the mandatory spending cuts that cut across all agencies of government but not entitlement programs. The cuts were intended to be so unpopular that both sides would be motivated to negotiate a broader deficit reduction package rather than let them get implemented. However, the charged political environment of an election year in 2012 prevented such an agreement. The cuts amount to roughly 9% for a broad range of non-defense programs and 13% for the Pentagon over the remaining seven months of fiscal year 2013. While both sides oppose the across-the-board nature of the cuts, with no leeway for shifting funds to protect specific targeted programs, conservatives argue the total amount is a manageable slice in federal spending while Democrats say it will cause unnecessary harm. Obama and Democrats insist that any possible agreement to replace the cuts with alternative deficit reduction should include more tax revenue from closing loopholes and subsidies that benefit wealthy industries and individuals. Boehner and Republicans reject any kind of tax or revenue increase, noting they already agreed to Obama\u2019s push to return rates on top income earners to higher levels of the 1990s. Delays in opening Yellowstone According to GOP leaders, the president and Democrats have yet to propose a serious plan to reduce spending, including costly entitlement programs, on a scale necessary to bring chronic federal deficits and debt under control. Obama campaigned on increasing the tax burden on the wealthy in winning re-election last year, and he and Democrats contend the vote result showed public support for their position. However, the president\u2019s second term has so far included the same kind of congressional dysfunction that dominated his first four years. In recent weeks, Republicans refused to budge on spending cuts and delayed full Senate consideration of Chuck Hagel as defense secretary before he was eventually confirmed. New political wrangling is also expected over the Obama\u2019s nominee to head the CIA.

            "article_content": "President Obama calls upcoming forced spending cuts the \"wrong prescription\" A GOP Cabinet member urges fellow Republicans to join the debate Republican Sen. Rand Paul calls forced spending cuts \"the least we can do\" Without a deal, the cuts begin taking effect on March 1 President Barack Obama, Democratic governors and even a Republican Cabinet member on Friday blamed GOP intransigence for the failure so far to reach a deal to avert the harshest impacts of forced spending cuts set to take effect March 1. The increasingly strong entreaties for Republicans to discuss a middle-ground solution with Obama and Democrats showed White House concern over the impasse, as well as its ability to mount a message campaign during a week that Congress is on break. At issue are $85 billion in mandatory across-the-board spending cuts this fiscal year that both sides agree will harm the economy and national security. However, the intractable ideological divide over taxes, spending and the role of government has led to another political showdown in Washington like those that dominated Obama\u2019s first term. The president met with Democratic governors at the White House and later told reporters that the forced spending cuts \u2013 known in Washington jargon as sequestration \u2013 were the \u201cwrong prescription\u201d for reducing the nation\u2019s chronic deficits and debt. Others were less diplomatic. Vermont Gov. Peter Shumlin called Republicans \u201cobstructionist,\u201d while Connecticut Gov. Dan Malloy accused GOP legislators of false claims about the issue that he said the news media reported as truth. \u201cThis is craziness,\u201d Malloy said, adding that a lack of leadership among congressional Republicans meant \u201cthere\u2019s nobody to deal with anymore.\u201d Outgoing Transportation Secretary Ray LaHood, the lone Republican in Obama\u2019s Cabinet for now, also called on GOP legislators to fully join the debate. He noted the impending cuts would mean lengthy flight delays and control-tower closures at some small airports as soon as April without a deal. \u201cI think Republicans need to step up here,\u201d LaHood told reporters at the daily White House briefing, where he appeared with Press Secretary Jay Carney. \u201cThis requires compromise. This requires Republicans stepping forward with some ideas about how to keep essential services of government running at a level that people are accustomed to.\u201d At issue are the forced cuts and how they came about. They were mandated under a 2011 agreement to raise the federal borrowing limit, intended to motivate Congress to negotiate a comprehensive deficit reduction deal rather than face unpopular reductions in military and non-defense spending. Republicans contend the idea came from Obama and continually refer to the cuts as \u201cthe president\u2019s sequester,\u201d while the White House notes GOP leaders also endorsed and voted for the plan before Obama signed it into law. While House Speaker John Boehner and other Republican leaders say they want to replace the forced cuts with other spending reductions that would be less harmful, some GOP legislators contend the across-the-board approach of sequestration is a good start. \u201cIt\u2019s the least we can do,\u201d conservative Sen. Rand Paul, R-Kentucky, said Friday on Fox. \u201cWe have to slow down spending.\u201d For their part, Obama and Democrats continue to push the central theme of last year\u2019s election campaign in calling for a combination of more tax revenue from the wealthy as part of a package that includes spending cuts, rather than what they call a meat cleaver approach. Republicans, however, reject any talk of higher taxes or increased tax revenue after conceding on that issue in the January agreement that raised rates on the nation\u2019s top income earners. They want to shrink the size of government and the spending needed to run it, while Democrats want to strengthen the safety net of federal programs that help the poor, the elderly, the disabled and other vulnerable communities. While both sides accuse the other of refusing to yield, the Democratic voice was more prominent Friday. Obama \u201chas offered a balanced approach and it is time for (the) Republican Congress to stop playing games with our jobs recovery, to stop playing games with our middle class who struggled long enough (and) finally see some hope, some income growth, some job growth,\u201d Shumlin said. \u201cWe are seeing it in our states.\u201d In an interview on Thursday with the radio program \u201cKeepin It Real with Al Sharpton,\u201d Obama said GOP opposition to any further tax hikes or ending loopholes to raise more tax revenue was \u201cthe thing that binds their party together at this point.\u201d \u201cUnfortunately, I think Republicans have been so dug-in on this notion of never raising taxes that it becomes difficult for them to see an obvious answer right in front of them,\u201d the president said. In an opinion piece published Wednesday in the Wall Street Journal, Boehner labeled the spending cuts \u201cugly and dangerous,\u201d saying they would diminish resources for the military, law enforcement, border security, aviation safety and other programs. However, the de facto GOP leader on the issue argued that his party\u2019s agreement to higher tax rates for the wealthy ended the discussion on further tax or revenue increases now. The forced spending cuts to the military and other government agencies \u2013 but not entitlement programs that drive chronic federal deficits \u2013 were intended to motivate Congress to come up with a comprehensive deficit-reduction plan sought by both sides. Such an agreement proved impossible in the hyper-political climate of an election year, and the government-wide cuts opposed by both sides now are set to take effect. That would mean $85 billion in cuts for the rest of fiscal year 2013, which ends September 30, as part of a 10-year total of about $1 trillion. A $110 billion proposal by Senate Democrats, which is similar to a plan by House Democrats, would replace the forced spending cuts for a year by getting more tax revenue from millionaires, stopping some agriculture subsidies and cutting military spending after the end of combat operations in Afghanistan in 2014. GOP leaders, meanwhile, seek to blame Obama for the forced spending cuts so that any hardships that result, such as predicted job losses and reductions in economic growth, get attributed to the president. A majority of Americans support an approach that combines spending cuts and some tax increases to reduce federal deficits, according to surveys Thursday by Pew/USA Today and  Bloomberg News. However, another poll on Friday showed limited support for reducing specific programs, such as defense, entitlements, education and health care. According to the new Pew Research Center survey, a majority of the public wants to either keep funding the same or increase it for 18 of 19 federal programs mentioned in the poll. The only exception was U.S. aid for people in need around the world, with 49% of respondents saying such assistance should be increased or kept at current levels while 48% said it should be decreased.

            "article_content": "NEW: Obama says opposing higher taxes on the wealthy is what \"binds\" the GOP Forced spending cuts will harm the economy and national security, both sides agree President Obama says Republicans refuse to compromise House Speaker Boehner rejects Democratic demands for more revenue as a solution Both sides agree that forced spending cuts set to take effect next week will harm the economy and national security. Both sides have plans for averting the worst impacts. So why are there no formal negotiations taking place with Congress on break this week as leaders from both parties accuse each other of intransigence? Once again, the answer is the Washington blame game. The same pattern of politically inspired brinksmanship that dominated President Barack Obama\u2019s first term is continuing in the early days of his second. Now, the collective weight of Obama\u2019s re-election in November and the subsequent fiscal cliff deal in which Republicans conceded on tax increases makes compromise seem distant, if not impossible, in the short term. The impact of forced budget cuts Forced spending cuts blame game All talk, little action on forced cuts Blind budget cuts explained with tomato The central issue is the same one that framed last year\u2019s presidential campaign. Republicans want to shrink the size of government and the spending needed to run it, while Democrats want to strengthen the safety net of federal programs that help the poor, the elderly, the disabled and other vulnerable communities. Obama and leaders of both parties warn the pending $85 billion in spending cuts set to kick in on March 1 bode ill for the nation, but the rhetoric so far has focused on blaming the other side. In an interview on Thursday with the radio program \u201cKeepin It Real with Al Sharpton,\u201d Obama said GOP opposition to any further tax hikes or ending loopholes to raise more tax revenue was \u201cthe thing that binds their party together at this point.\u201d \u201cUnfortunately, I think Republicans have been so dug-in on this notion of never raising taxes that it becomes difficult for them to see an obvious answer right in front of them,\u201d the president said. \u201cWe continue to reach out to the Republicans and say, \u2018this is not gonna be good for the economy, it\u2019s not gonna be good for ordinary people\u2019 but I don\u2019t know if they are going to move and that\u2019s what we are going to have to try to keep pushing over the next seven, eight days,\u201d Obama said. In an opinion piece published Wednesday in the Wall Street Journal, House Speaker John Boehner labeled the spending cuts \u201cugly and dangerous,\u201d saying they would diminish resources for the military, law enforcement, border security, aviation safety and other programs. However, the de facto GOP leader on the issue argued that his party\u2019s agreement to raise tax rates on top income earners in January ended the discussion on further tax or revenue increases now. Instead, Boehner said he wanted other cuts to replace the across-the-board approach of sequestration, accusing Obama and Democrats of ignoring what he called the nation\u2019s spending problem. \u201cThe president got his higher taxes\u201d with no spending cuts in the January deal, he wrote in the op-ed, adding that \u201cno one should be talking about raising taxes\u201d with examples of rampant government spending such as \u201cpaying people to play video games, giving folks free cell phones and buying $47,000 cigarette smoking machines.\u201d Voters in November returned Obama to office and gave Democrats a stronger Senate majority while reducing the Republican majority in the House, leading to the January agreement on the fiscal cliff by the outgoing Congress in its final hours. That deal raised tax rates on families earning more than $450,000 and individuals earning above $400,000 while maintaining lower rates for everyone else. It also put off until March 1 the mandated spending cuts from a 2011 agreement that increased how much money the Treasury could borrow to meet financial obligations. Budget woes: Been there, done that? Obama: People will lose jobs over cuts TSA cuts: Longer airport security lines What forced budget cuts would look like Known in Washington jargon as sequestration, the forced spending cuts to the military and other government agencies \u2013 but not entitlement programs that drive chronic federal deficits \u2013 were intended to motivate Congress to come up with a comprehensive deficit-reduction plan sought by both sides. Obama more emotional on spending cuts However, such an agreement proved impossible in the hyper-political climate of an election year, and the government-wide cuts opposed by both sides now are set to take effect. That would mean $85 billion in cuts for the rest of fiscal year 2013, which ends September 30, as part of a 10-year total of about $1 trillion. Obama and Democrats are offering the same approach to the issue as a central theme of the election, calling for the wealthy to pay more as part of a package of spending cuts and increased revenue to replace the forced cuts of sequestration. Ratcheting up pressure on Republicans with Congress in recess for Presidents Day week, White House spokesman Jay Carney announced Thursday that Obama had phoned Boehner and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell. He provided no details beyond describing the calls as \u201cgood conversations.\u201d Both Boehner and McConnell have complained that Obama refuses to address needed spending cuts and entitlement reforms to bring about substantive deficit reduction, and the timing of the phone calls appeared in response to questions about a lack of formal talks involving the president. A $110 billion proposal by Senate Democrats, which is similar to a plan by House Democrats, would replace the forced spending cuts for a year by getting more tax revenue from millionaires, stopping some agriculture subsidies and cutting military spending after the end of combat operations in Afghanistan in 2014. \u201cYou may not like what we\u2019ve proposed but at least let us have a vote in the House of Representatives,\u201d Rep. Chris Van Hollen, D-Maryland, said Thursday in criticizing congressional Republicans. \u201cCome back here, call the Congress into session in the next eight days and let\u2019s have a vote. If you want to vote no and say you prefer the consequences of the sequester to the alternative \u2026 that\u2019s your right.\u201d On Tuesday, Obama held a campaign-style event at the White House to call for balancing the impact of deficit reduction so that the middle class and vulnerable citizens such as the elderly don\u2019t get hit too hard. Speaking in near apocalyptic terms, the president warned of criminals going free, longer security lines at airports, reduced military readiness, fewer border guards, pre-schoolers losing access to Head Start programs and other problems if the full brunt of the spending cuts occur. Where you\u2019ll feel forced spending cuts GOP leaders, meanwhile, seek to blame Obama for the forced spending cuts so that any hardships that result, such as predicted job losses and reductions in economic growth, get attributed to the president. \u201cThe president\u2019s sequester is the wrong way to reduce the deficit, but it is here to stay until Washington Democrats get serious about cutting spending,\u201d wrote Boehner, R-Ohio, in the op-ed. \u201cThe government simply cannot keep delaying the inevitable and spending money it doesn\u2019t have. So, as the president\u2019s outrage about the sequester grows in coming days, Republicans have a simple response: Mr. President, we agree that your sequester is bad policy. What spending are you willing to cut to replace it?\u201d Congress passive as spending cuts near By using language such as \u201cthe president\u2019s sequester,\u201d Boehner and Republicans want to implant a public perception that the plan was Obama\u2019s all along. The White House concedes that it raised the idea of forced budget cuts during the negotiations in 2011 on the debt ceiling deal, but argues Republicans, including Boehner and other House leaders, agreed to making it part of the deal and then voted for it. Now, Carney says, Republicans acted like they never supported the idea. He insisted Thursday that Obama has offered the only legitimate compromise proposal for significant deficit reduction, noting the Congressional Budget Office determined the president\u2019s plan would bring deficits below 3% of gross domestic product by 2015, which he called an accepted target by economists. Carney labeled any comparisons between what Obama proposes and the Republican stance as a \u201cfalse equivalence,\u201d arguing the president\u2019s approach of spending cuts, entitlement reforms and new tax revenue is a compromise from a hard-line Democratic position that rejects any benefit reductions in Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. \u201cYou come half way and your negotiating partner stays where he or she is, that makes it very difficult to reach a compromise,\u201d Carney told reporters. \u201cYou need compromise from the other side.\u201d In negotiations last December on the fiscal cliff agreement, Obama was willing to include a less generous inflation index for benefits such as Social Security, despite vehement protests from his liberal base, Carney noted. \u201cThere\u2019s some responsibility here on the Republican side to do what the president has done, which is to hear what the American people are saying, which is please compromise, please be reasonable, please do not adopt positions that represent a \u2018my way or the highway\u2019 approach,\u201d Carney said. Obama, Republicans clash on forced spending cuts On Wednesday, Carney defended Obama\u2019s campaign-style approach to generating public support for his stance on the issue, saying such pressure worked in the spending and deficit agreements of the past two years. \u201cYou know why they happened?  Because the American people supported those positions that the president took,\u201d Carney said. \u201cAnd, in the end, Congress responded to the will of the American people. And we hope that\u2019s what\u2019s going to happen again this time.\u201d A new poll on Thursday showed a strong majority of Americans want the kind of comprehensive deficit reduction called for by Obama, but support for a stop-gap measure on the forced spending cuts was less certain. Seven of 10 respondents in the Pew Research and USA Today survey called major legislation to reduce the deficit the most important priority for Congress, and 76% backed the combination of spending cuts and revenue increases favored by the president and Democrats. At the same time, 73% want more spending cuts than tax increases while only about 20% say the solution should be spending cuts alone. If the forced spending cuts go into effect, 49% of respondents would blame Republicans in Congress while 31% would blame Obama, the poll showed. However, 49% said the cuts should be delayed while 40% said they should go into effect. CNN\u2019s Gregory Wallace contributed to this report.",
