            "article_content": "GOP megadonor Charles Koch wants a bigger conversation on criminal justice reform Koch, and his brother David, are key players in the Republican donor class Some 2016 Republican presidential hopefuls have said they favor criminal justice reform Charles Koch, the billionaire GOP donor whose money plays a big role in shaping Republican campaign efforts, said he plans to make criminal justice reform a priority of his as the country heads into the next presidential election. \u201cOver the next year, we are going to be pushing the issues key to this, which need a lot of work in this country,\u201d Koch, a Kansas native, told the Wichita Eagle in a story published this weekend. \u201cAnd that would be freedom of speech, cronyism and how that relates to opportunities for the disadvantaged.\u201d Koch\u2019s comments might come as good news to Sen. Rand Paul, who\u2019s made sentencing reform a major part of his agenda while he tries to appeal to nontraditional GOP voters ahead of a likely presidential bid. Gov. Chris Christie, who\u2019s set to make his 2016 decision in the coming months, has been active in pushing for bail reform in New Jersey. And other prospective Republican 2016 candidates \u2013 including Texas Gov. Rick Perry, former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin and Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas \u2014 have been supportive of sentencing reform for nonviolent drug offenders. Following the 2012 presidential loss, in which Republican nominee Mitt Romney won only 6% support among African Americans and 27% among Latinos, Republicans have been more vocal about making changes to the criminal justice system for nonviolent offenders \u2013 an issue that resonates deeply within minority communities. Koch, according to the Kansas newspaper, said the criminal justice system needs reform \u201cespecially for the disadvantaged\u201d as well as changes to make it \u201cfair\u201d and to make \u201csentences more appropriate to the crime that has been committed.\u201d His chief counsel, Mark Holden, said the tough-on-crime efforts by lawmakers in recent decades have disproportionately affected minorities. \u201cIt definitely appears to have a racial angle, intended or not,\u201d he said, according to the Wichita Eagle. Holden added that Koch also wants to address voting rights for former offenders and make it easier for nonviolent offenders to find employment after completing their sentences. Campaign observers pay close attention to the political interests of Koch and his brother, David. Political groups associated with the powerful duo spent $100 million on races in 2014. According to the newspaper, Koch\u2019s interest in criminal justice reform originated from a lengthy, expensive case defending his company, Koch Petroleum Group, against 97 felony indictments involving alleged environmental crimes at an oil refinery in the 1990s. All but six of the charges were ultimately dropped, and the case ended in a $10 million settlement.",

            "article_content": "President Barack Obama said Sony \"made a mistake\" canceling its movie release Obama called on Congress to end the Cuba embargo Obama said he might be able to work with congressional Republicans on tax reforms and trade The news conference came just hours before the Obama family departs for vacation in Hawaii President Barack Obama prodded Congress to eliminate the United States\u2019 decades-old Cuba embargo Friday, saying that improving relations with the communist country will help open its \u201chermetically sealed society\u201d \u2013 even if changes come in \u201cfits and starts.\u201d He said he doesn\u2019t expect lawmakers to strip the embargo away immediately, and that Congress will need time to digest a deal he struck this week to free American contractor Alan Gross, trade imprisoned spies and ease U.S. economic restrictions on Cuba in exchange for the release of dozens of political prisoners and expanded Internet there. His comments came during a feisty year-end news conference Friday, just hours before Obama and his family boarded Air Force One for a holiday vacation in Hawaii. \u201cI don\u2019t anticipate overnight changes. But what I know deep in my bones is that if you\u2019ve done the same thing for 50 years and nothing\u2019s changed, you should try something different if you want a different outcome, and this gives us an opportunity for a different outcome, because suddenly Cuba is open to the world in ways that it has not been before,\u201d Obama said. \u201cThe more the Cuban people see what\u2019s possible, the more interested they are going to be in change. But how societies change is country-specific. It\u2019s culture-specific,\u201d he said. Obama offered some notes of caution, saying a presidential visit Cuba or Cuban President Raul Castro coming to the United States isn\u2019t \u201cin the cards.\u201d His moves have already triggered controversy among potential Republican 2016 presidential contenders. Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, who accused Obama of giving up leverage, is sparring with Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, who advocates a smaller U.S. footprint overseas. Obama said he expects a \u201chealthy debate\u201d to rage in Congress. \u201cI think that ultimately we need to go ahead and pull down the embargo, which I think has been self-defeating in advancing the aims that we\u2019re interested in,\u201d Obama said. \u201cBut I don\u2019t anticipate that that happens right away.\u201d Obama sounded an optimistic tone, saying he is \u201cenergized\u201d and \u201cexcited\u201d about the final two years of his presidency even after Democrats in Congress were shellacked in November\u2019s midterm election. \u201cMy presidency is entering the fourth quarter,\u201d Obama said. \u201cInteresting stuff happens in the fourth quarter. And I am looking forward to it.\u201d The President immediately made headlines by saying Sony \u201cmade a mistake\u201d canceling a movie after North Korea\u2019s hack. He also drew attention for calling on female journalists for all eight of the questions he took \u2013 which White House Press Secretary Josh Earnest said was intentional. \u201cThe fact is, there are many women from a variety of news organizations who day-in and day-out do the hard work of covering the President of the United States,\u201d Earnest said. \u201cAs the questioner list started to come together, we realized that we had a unique opportunity to highlight that fact at the President\u2019s closely watched, end of the year news conference.\u201d Obama touched on the clashes that are guaranteed to come once Republicans take full control of Congress in January, setting up showdowns over Obama\u2019s signature health care law, the Keystone XL pipeline that conservatives would like to green-light, financial regulations and more. He identified international trade and tax reform as areas he might be able to find common ground with the GOP-led House and Senate, and said staff-level conversations will take place between Obama\u2019s White House and GOP congressional leadership between now and the Jan. 20 State of the Union address about individual and corporate tax reform. Obama said he\u2019ll issue proposals of his own to overhaul the corporate tax structure. \u201cThen there are other companies that are paying zero because they\u2019ve got better accountants or lawyers. That\u2019s not fair,\u201d he said. \u201cThere are companies that are parking money outside the country because of tax avoidance. We think it\u2019s important that everybody pay something if they are effectively headquartered in the United States.\u201d But he threatened to veto any bills that would weaken the health care law or rolls back any of the 2010 Dodd-Frank financial services reforms \u2013 which were recently thrust into the spotlight after liberals howled over the roll-back of one of those reforms in a deal this month to fund the government. \u201cI think there are going to be some tough fights on those areas where we disagree,\u201d Obama said. \u201cIf Republicans seek to take health care away from people who just got it, they will meet stiff resistance from me. If they try to water down consumer protections that we put in place in the aftermath of the financial crisis, I will say no, and I\u2019m confident that I will be able to uphold vetoes on those types of provisions.\u201d Here\u2019s what Obama said about several other issues Friday: KEYSTONE PIPELINE \u2013 President Barack Obama said the Keystone XL pipeline \u2013 which Republican congressional leaders have said they intend to approve legislation to authorize early next year \u2013 is \u201cnot even going to be a nominal benefit to U.S. consumers.\u201d Obama didn\u2019t threaten to veto a bill that would take approval of the 1,179-mile, Canada-to-Texas pipeline out of the State Department\u2019s hands. But he downplayed its potential effects and said that if Congress wants to create the kinds of construction jobs that could accompany the pipeline, it should instead approve bills to improve the country\u2019s infrastructure. \u201cThere\u2019s very little impact, nominal impact, on U.S. gas prices \u2013 what the average American consumer cares about \u2013 by having this pipeline come through,\u201d Obama said. \u201cAnd sometimes, the way this gets sold is, \u2018Let\u2019s get this oil and it\u2019s going to come here,\u2019 and the implication is, it\u2019s going to lower oil prices here in the United States \u2013 and it\u2019s not. There\u2019s a global oil market.\u201d RACIAL TENSIONS WITH POLICE \u2013 Obama argued that \u201creally concrete, practical\u201d law enforcement reforms will result from a review his administration is currently producing, and sounded an optimistic tone about preventing deaths like Michael Brown\u2019s in Ferguson, Missouri and Eric Garner\u2019s in New York City in the future. \u201cWhat I don\u2019t think is always captured in our political debates is, the vast majority of people are just trying to do the right thing. And people are basically good and have good intentions,\u201d Obama said. \u201cSometimes our institutions and our systems don\u2019t work as well as they should. Sometimes you\u2019ve got a police department that has gotten into bad habits over a period of time and hasn\u2019t maybe surfaced some hidden biases that we all carry around.\u201d \u201cBut if you offer practical solutions, I think people want to fix these problems,\u201d he said. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a situation where people feel good seeing somebody choked and dying. I think that troubles everybody. So there\u2019s an opportunity of all of us to come together and take a practical approach to these problems.\u201d THE ECONOMY \u2013 He called 2014 the \u201cstrongest year for job growth since the 1990s\u201d and pointing to rising middle class wages, increased energy production and lower gas prices, and highlighted recent economic reports that have identified a 57-month streak of job growth, producing 11 million new positions. \u201cAs a country, we have every right to be proud of what we\u2019ve accomplished: More jobs, more people insured, a growing economy, shrinking deficits, bustling industry, booming energy \u2013 pick any metric that you want; America\u2019s resurgence is real. We are better off,\u201d Obama said. He said gas prices are 70 cents lower this year than they were last Christmas, and the Obama administration\u2019s bailout of the automotive industry is \u201ceffectively over.\u201d \u201cYes, there were crises that we had to tackle around the world \u2013 many that were unanticipated,\u201d Obama said. \u201cWe have more work to do to make sure our economy, our justice system and our government work not just for the few but the many. But there is no doubt we can enter into the new year with renewed confidence that America is making significant strides where it counts.\u201d NORTH KOREA\u2019S SONY HACK \u2013 Sony \u201cmade a mistake\u201d in halting the release of its film \u201cThe Interview\u201d after hackers that the FBI has linked to North Korea stole the company\u2019s documents and threatened theaters that showed the film,\u201d Obama said. \u201cWe cannot have a society where some dictator someplace can start imposing censorship here in the United States, because if somebody is able to intimidate folks out of releasing a satirical movie, imagine what they\u2019ll do when they see a documentary that they don\u2019t like, or news reports that they don\u2019t like \u2013 or even worse, imagine if producers or distributors or others start engaging in self-censorship because they don\u2019t want to offend the sensibilities of somebody whose sensibilities probably need to be offended,\u201d Obama said. \u201cSo, you know, that\u2019s not who we are. That\u2019s not what America\u2019s about. Again, I\u2019m sympathetic that Sony as a private company was worried about liabilities and this and that and the other. I wish they\u2019d spoken to me first. I would have told them, do not get into a pattern in which you\u2019re intimidated by these kinds of criminal attacks,\u201d he said.",

            "article_content": "NEW: Sen. Mary Landrieu lost her runoff race to GOP challenger Bill Cassidy on Saturday Landrieu's supporters put on a brave face until the end Maybe she meant to, maybe she didn\u2019t, but Mary Landrieu reached straight for the encyclopedia of Things Losing Candidates Say. The Louisiana Senator \u2014 an 18-year Washington veteran and outgoing chairwoman of the Senate Energy Committee, blessed with one of the most recognizable last names in southern politics \u2014  stepped away from a modest crowd of supporters at a campaign event here for an interview about her difficult runoff race against Republican Bill Cassidy. \u201cIt\u2019s not over until it\u2019s over,\u201d Landrieu said of the campaign, which has been left for dead by national Democrats. \u201cThe only poll that counts is Election Day.\u201d Look Who's Coming to Dinner The nerd science of political campaigns Will these people pick your president? Is New Hampshire about to get nasty? Could Rand Paul support gay marriage? The luckiest mustache in Iowa 'Hambycast' goes behind grill in Iowa A few of the reporters and political types standing nearby exchanged knowing glances. Landrieu\u2019s defeat gives Republicans ninth seat this cycle As defined by political analyst Stuart Rothenberg, who curated the definitive list of \u201cThings Losing Candidates Say\u201d for Roll Call last year, the luckless phrase is a pretty good indicator that \u201cyou are losing the race at the time and have no empirical evidence to the contrary.\u201d The evidence was stacked against Landrieu, who advanced to the runoff after losing a strategic bet that she would win Louisiana\u2019s non-partisan primary outright four weeks ago. Instead, she got 42 percent, far short of the 50.1% needed to win, and voters are now consolidating around Cassidy. If Landrieu had pulled it out Saturday, it would be have been an epic fourth quarter miracle that would put Les Miles to shame. She would have had to keep African-American turnout on par with the November primary, and somehow find a way to increase her support among white voters from the dreadful 18 percent she received last month, all in the middle of the holiday season. It was a near-impossible lift. There hasn\u2019t been a gold standard poll of the race, but she was losing by 15 or 20 points depending on the survey. The actions of national Democrats were an even better tell. The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee canceled its ad reservations for the runoff after Landrieu failed to win the Nov. 4 jungle primary outright, effectively ceding the airwaves to Cassidy and Republicans, who are outspending her 7-1 on television. Supporters put on a brave face. \u201cMary has always had close races and she always pulled them out,\u201d said Harold Ritchie, a state representative and funeral director from Bogalusa. \u201cA lot of us are counting on that happening one more time.\u201d Politically speaking, Louisiana is a weird place. They have elections in odd years and run \u201cjungle primaries.\u201d Politicians, state and local, genuflect before the gods of the oil and gas industry. It\u2019s a state that\u2019s twice voted an Indian-American Catholic Rhodes scholar into the governor\u2019s office (Bobby Jindal) and seems primed to succeed him with a Republican who reportedly liked to wear diapers while soliciting a prostitute in the French Quarter (David Vitter). There\u2019s a proud populist streak, a fraught racial history and a healthy dash of corruption. \u201cLouisiana politics is of an intensity and complexity that are matched, in my experience, only in the Republic of Lebanon,\u201d A.J. Leibling once wrote about the state. He was referring to the strange gumbo coalitions \u2014 white, black, cajun, redneck, uptown, downtown \u2014 that candidates assembled to win statewide elections. But Liebling was scribbling those thoughts for The New Yorker in 1960. These days, elections are nationalized, waged on television and online, and not even the most Lousianan of Louisianans can safely count on surviving at the ballot box \u2014 no matter how much clout one has built up in Washington or how many LSU tailgates one attends. Republicans have clobbered Landrieu with television ads tying her to President Barack Obama, whose approval rating in Louisiana, according to midterm exit polls, is 39 percent. \u201cThe Republicans and her opponent Bill Cassidy have done a very effective job at creating an emotional target for voters to direct their frustration towards, and that would be President Obama,\u201d said New Orleans-based Democratic pollster Silas Lee. Landrieu, first elected in 1996, compared herself to New Orleans Saints quarterback Drew Brees and Cassidy to an unknown rookie. Voting her out of office, she argues, would be akin to benching the star quarterback when the team needs it most. The argument, though, had lost its resonance with Obama\u2019s waning popularity and the newly-in-charge Republican Senate majority, depriving Landrieu of her coveted position as chairwoman of the Energy Committee. \u201cSeniority is based on how many years you have served,\u201d she said. \u201cNothing has changed. I will have served 18 years. I have served with Democrats in charge, I have served with Republicans in charge. Nothing can take my seniority away. I will still be one of the highest ranking members of the Senate. I won\u2019t be chair. But I will be ranking member of the Energy Committee, and in that I will convene meetings of Democrats on Energy Committee, so Louisianans will still be at forefront, at the leadership table. I will still be part of the leadership team. That\u2019s much better than sitting on the back bench or sitting on the rookie bench.\u201d Landrieu spent the final week flogging Cassidy, a congressman and LSU physician, over a late-breaking news story about questionable paychecks he received for part-time medical teaching work he may or may not have done at the university in Baton Rouge. \u201cThis story has legs,\u201d Landrieu said. \u201cThis story is breaking. You know, I wish it had broken a couple of weeks ago, but you know what? It broke now. Bill Cassidy cannot say, \u2018I am a doctor, I am higher than the law.\u2019\u201d The argument felt like a Hail Mary, the last gasp of a zombie campaign that many Democrats are waiting for to die in a canebrake. And even the senator admits how difficult it is to run a campaign when no one, in Louisiana or elsewhere, seems to be listening anymore. \u201cNothing seems to be breaking through these days,\u201d she said with a sigh, deviating slightly from her message. \u201cIt\u2019s a very strange situation, all over the country. It\u2019s like people are just so mad, these commercials have really gotten people\u2019s emotions up. So getting people to focus on what really matters, leadership, honesty, integrity, hard work \u2026\u201d Landrieu trailed off. \u201cI am not going to give up,\u201d she said. \u201cThese last few days are really important.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Watch \u201cWolf\u201d on Wednesday at 1 p.m. ET for Wolf Blitzer\u2019s interview with Ben Carson. Ben Carson is a potential 2016 GOP presidential candidate Carson placed second in a CNN poll Tuesday Carson will decide whether he will run by May It was 1965 and Ben Carson, an eighth-grade black student in Detroit, was stunned. Unable to control her anger, his teacher lashed out at white students for failing to outperform Carson, who had just been awarded the class\u2019s highest academic achievement. In an interview last week, Carson described the teacher as being from a time when some people thought \u201chow can a black person ever intellectually do better than a white person?\u201d \u201cTo her, it was the most abnormal thing that ever happened in the history of the world,\u201d Carson said. \u201cTo me, I was determined I would show her.\u201d Is Ben Carson qualified to be President? Historic firsts for the GOP The road ahead for Obama and GOP Nearly 50 years later, Carson \u2013 relatively unknown outside of conservative circles \u2013 is on the verge of becoming a political phenomenon. He placed second behind Mitt Romney in a CNN/ORC poll released Tuesday asking Republicans about their preferred presidential nominee in 2016. Though his support only reached 10% in the poll, Carson outpaced more high-profile potential presidential contenders like former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee. He\u2019s gaining traction as an African-American in a party that is struggling to connect with minority communities. But Carson is remarkably checked when asked about how, to this day, he deals with racism. \u201cIf somebody has a problem with the way that I look, more power to them,\u201d Carson said. \u201cLet them sit and stew in it. I just got so many more important things to do than to deal with that.\u201d That doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s silent on the racial issues of the day. After last week\u2019s violence in Ferguson, Missouri, Carson slammed President Barack Obama for contributing to poor race relations. \u201cI actually believe that things were better before this president was elected,\u201d he told radio broadcaster Hugh Hewitt. \u201cAnd I think that things have gotten worse because of his unusual emphasis on race.\u201d READ: The new threat: \u2018Racism without racists\u2019 He\u2019s offered provocative commentary on a wide range of other issues, telling FOX News in May that the Veterans Affairs scandal was a \u201cgift from God to show us what happens when you take layers and layers of bureaucracy and place them between the patients and the health care provider.\u201d In a March interview with Breitbart, he compared the modern American government to Nazi Germany. And at the 2013 Values Voters Summit, Carson said Obamacare is \u201cthe worst thing that has happened in this nation since slavery.\u201d Carson: Race relations have gotten worse under Obama The \u2018PC police\u2019 For Carson, abandoning political correctness is a central element of his persona \u2013 and something that\u2019s winning fans in the GOP base. Carson recently appeared at an event for the Family Leader, an influential social conservative organization in Iowa. \u201cHe was very well received, and enthusiastically well received,\u201d said Bob Vander Plaats, president and CEO of the organization, who noted Carson spoke to 900 attendees about pressing domestic concerns including cultural issues, foreign policy, and his disdain for political correctness. \u201cIt is like a breath of fresh air when he talks about not being politically correct and how he won\u2019t be controlled by the \u2018PC police\u2019 and he will say what needs to be said,\u201d Vander Plaats said. \u201cThat message really resonated.\u201d Carson is well known in the medical community \u2013 he\u2019s a celebrated pediatric neurosurgeon \u2013 and Cuba Gooding, Jr. played him in the 2009 made-for-television movie: \u201cGifted Hands: The Ben Carson Story.\u201d But his remarks at the National Prayer Breakfast in February 2013  catapulted him onto the national political stage. With Obama sitting just a few feet away, Carson warned that the U.S. was heading down the same path as Rome. \u201cMoral decay, fiscal irresponsibility,\u201d Carson said during his speech. \u201cThey destroyed themselves. If you don\u2019t think that can happen to America, you get out your books and you start reading.\u201d Carson said 15 minutes after his remarks, organizers of the Prayer Breakfast called him and said the White House was \u201cupset and that I needed to call and apologize. I said, \u2018I spoke to the president after the Prayer Breakfast and he was quite cordial and didn\u2019t seem upset. I don\u2019t see why he would be upset, unless what I said applied to him.\u2019\u201d His speech was embraced by GOP activists and radio talk show hosts. Carson became an instant political celebrity for conservatives. \u201cI expected a reaction, but I didn\u2019t expect it to be that profound, quite frankly,\u201d Carson said of his remarks at the Prayer Breakfast. \u201cObviously, it touched a chord with millions of people and I thought it would die down after a while, but instead of dying down it continued to build.\u201d Karen Finney, a Democratic strategist, said that Carson is \u201ccertainly someone to be taken seriously,\u201d in the GOP primary, but added that this does not necessarily transfer to the general election. \u201cIn terms of appeal in a general election, there are comments he has made that can come back to haunt him,\u201d she said. READ: Poll: Americans predict more gridlock Carson dismisses those who criticize him for his remarks, and said they are just blowing them out of proportion. Yet, Carson does acknowledge that he is trying to make a point when he speaks on the issues of the day. \u201cI try to talk about what I actually see that\u2019s going on and this is what we need in America,\u201d he said. \u201cWe need people who are not afraid to express themselves and who are not afraid to debate issues.\u201d Cornell William Brooks, president of the NAACP, said he admires Carson as a surgeon and noted his son was inspired by one of Carson\u2019s books to become a thoracic surgeon. But in terms of race relations, the two men are not on the same page. \u201cHe is an extraordinary surgeon, extraordinarily passionate human being,\u201d Brooks said. \u201cBut I disagree with the personalization of a set of policies that have been harmful, not only to African-Americans, but the country as a whole with any particular party.  \u2026 Dr. Carson stands like a giant in the operating room, but in the civil rights arena we would love to have more conversation with him about our positions.\u201d From poverty to the operating room Raised by a single mother with a third grade education, Carson rose from poverty and racial division to achieve success. Carson\u2019s mother left his bigamist father when he was eight years old and, despite her inability to read, forced him and his brother to spend their days with books and focusing on their schoolwork. Carson struggled in his early elementary school years. At 10, though, Carson said the most defining moment in his life occurred: He was the only child in his class able to identify an obsidian rock held up by his teacher. \u201cIt said to me that everyone thinks you are dumb, but you are not dumb at all,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that was really the beginning of change.\u201d The second most defining moment in his life almost led to tragedy. Carson got into an argument with a friend and, in a fit of rage, lunged at him with a knife. A belt buckle blocked the blow and saved his friend from injury. Carson said he ran away from the scene. \u201cI locked myself in the bathroom and started thinking about my life and I started praying,\u201d he said. \u201cIn the three hours I stayed in that bathroom, I came to an understanding that to lash out at people is not a sign of strength, it was a sign of weakness.\u201d Eventually, Carson earned his undergraduate degree from Yale and went to medical school at the University of Michigan and joined Johns Hopkins when he graduated, becoming a world-renowned pediatric neurosurgeon. Carson: \u2018I feel fingers\u2019 from God to run for President On the campaign trail Carson recently switched his voter registration from independent to Republican \u2013 a move he acknowledged was spurred on by a possible presidential run. \u201cIf I decide to run, I need to run as a Democrat or Republican,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t want to run as a third-party candidate. And I would have to choose one of the parties.\u201d But the retired doctor noted that if he decides to seek the GOP presidential nomination, it would not be as a \u201ctraditional candidate.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m never going to be a politician,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019m not going to listen to the people who\u2019ve already tried \u2026 because then I\u2019ll be them. I won\u2019t be me. If I am not me, what would be the point, even if you won, of being in office under false pretenses?\u201d Carson further embraces the status as an outsider with no government experience, which he said is a positive with voters. \u201cI see it as a drawback if you want to continue going down the pathway of government controlling every aspect of our lives,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t see it as a problem at all if somebody wants to re-establish the original intent in this country, which was a nation where the government conformed to the will of the people and not vice versa.\u201d It is this type of talk that has created a \u201cbuzz\u201d among some conservatives in the early voting state of South Carolina, said GOP strategist Joel Sawyer. \u201cHe is someone that activists are listening to, to a degree,\u201d said Sawyer. \u201cPeople are talking about him.\u201d Helping to fan the flames of a possible presidential bid was a documentary about Carson that his business manager, Armstrong Williams, paid to air in in 22 states and Washington, D.C., last month. On the issues, Carson talks about revamping the tax structure, cutting back on government regulations, and asserting the U.S. as a world power that will \u201cobliterate\u201d ISIS, and stand up to Russian President Vladimir Putin. When it comes to social issues, though, Carson emphasizes that there are more pressing issues the nation needs to address. \u201cI have likened America to a ship that\u2019s about to sail off Niagara Falls,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd the social issues are like little barnacles on the side of the ship. There are a lot of people leaning over the edge saying we got to get that barnacle. No, we have got to turn the ship around. Until we get things moving in the right direction, get the economy moving \u2026 bring people out of poverty \u2026 deal with our energy resources in an appropriate way, get education back where it belongs \u2026 those are the issues that are critical. The social issues as far as I\u2019m concerned they are personal issues for most people.\u201d Carson said if the right candidate emerges \u2013 which he describes as \u201csomebody who understands business and economics and somebody who understands our place on the world stage and the responsibilities that we have\u201d \u2013 he wouldn\u2019t run. He is giving himself until May 1 to get into the presidential race. In terms of being the only black candidate publicly interested in seeking the GOP nomination, Carson reverts back to his time as a surgeon. \u201cI operate on the thing that makes the person who they are,\u201d he said. \u201cThe skin doesn\u2019t matter to me. I really don\u2019t think those superficial characteristics have a place in society today.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Despite their differences, Chris Christie and Rand Paul agree on a few things They're pushing for reforms to criminal justice laws, and they want to see a more diverse GOP They sometimes take an \"agree to disagree\" approach on social issues Both men are considered potential presidential contenders It\u2019s been a year since New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie and Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky started taking jabs at each other, staking out their ideological territory within the Republican Party. But the two potential presidential contenders have also been singing the same tune on a few issues as they get closer to 2016. They\u2019ve been vocal advocates for sentencing reform for nonviolent, drug offenders. On politics, they\u2019ve bluntly urged Republicans to campaign in unfamiliar territory. And on social issues, both sometimes take an \u201cagree to disagree\u201d approach. Christie picks fight with Sen. Rand Paul Christie tops new CNN GOP 2016 poll Christie: Beware of 2016 candidates Experts say the two are finding common ground, but all three categories fall under the same umbrella: broadening the Republican Party, a narrative that many Republicans support. \u201cBoth men have their eyes squarely fixed on the next presidential election, but they\u2019re also trying to nudge the party as a whole to follow suit in an effort to expand the tent,\u201d said GOP strategist Ford O\u2019Connell. Such a strategy will benefit Christie and Paul if they campaign for the White House. But if they become opponents in the GOP primary, they\u2019ll continue to work to differentiate themselves and corner off their own parts of the GOP electorate. They\u2019re just both hoping that that electorate will be a lot bigger by the time 2016 rolls around. The \u2018dangerous\u2019 libertarian vs. the \u2018king of bacon\u2019 \u201cFeud.\u201d \u201cSpat.\u201d \u201cBattle.\u201d \u201cWar of words.\u201d Almost every fighting term was applied to last year\u2019s back and forth between Christie and Paul. It started last July at the Aspen Institute in Colorado, when Christie blasted Paul\u2019s \u201cstrain of libertarianism\u201d as \u201ca very dangerous thought.\u201d Chris Christie's 'pro-life' message Rand Paul: Perry 'dead wrong' Christie: Obama doing awful job on border Perry Vs. Paul: America the Isolationist? Gov. Chris Christie heads to Iowa Christie won't answer SCOTUS question Rand Paul takes aim at Rick Perry Hobby Lobby  on 2014, Clinton & Christie Rand & Rubio's 2016 moves Paul had been attacking the government\u2019s phone surveillance program unveiled by ex-NSA contractor Edward Snowden; Christie was defending it. Paul hit back, attacking Christie for pushing too hard to get Superstorm Sandy aid from the government. He even called the governor \u201cthe king of bacon\u201d on federal spending. The two continued exchanging barbs on surveillance and fiscal issues for weeks. Paul later argued the party was big enough for the both of them, and offered to have a beer with Christie. But the New Jersey governor said he was too busy running for a second term. For many pundits, their squabble quickly became a clear illustration of the rift between moderate Republicans and the growing libertarian wing of the GOP. Paul works to help non-violent offenders Rand Paul makes Civil Rights claim Rand Paul vs. Dick Cheney Divide in Iraq Rand Paul: Wouldn't send my son to Iraq Sen. Paul protests nominee over drones And for the two men themselves, it didn\u2019t hurt to dig in and pick a fight: Christie was in the middle of a re-election campaign in the deeply blue state of New Jersey, and Paul was trying to build his national profile. Since last summer, Christie and Paul have taken occasional swipes at each other, and it\u2019s safe to say tensions are still high now that the two find themselves among the top tier of most 2016 presidential polls \u2013 although their numbers aren\u2019t convincing. No one in the crowded GOP field has consistently polled above 20%. Criminal justice reform Despite their very large differences, they\u2019ve recently been advocating some of the same issues and ideas. For one, they\u2019re among a growing group of Republicans calling for reform to the criminal justice system on nonviolent drug offenders. In New Jersey, Christie\u2019s administration had already enacted reform that places first time drug offenders into mandatory, one-year treatment, rather than prison. Christie argues that it costs half as much to treat an addicted person than it does to lock them up, and he\u2019s been trying to make the program more attractive to social conservatives. \u201cIf you\u2019re pro-life, you\u2019ve got to be pro-life for the person who\u2019s sitting at the bottom of a jail cell, drug addicted, feeling like their life is over,\u201d Christie said last week at the Aspen Institute. \u201cIf we are a party that believes that every life is precious and no one should be deprived of a second chance, then we need to get on that issue.\u201d In another effort to tweak the criminal justice system, Christie rushed the Democratic-controlled legislature into a special session this week to meet and vote on bail reform. The legislation aims to make it easier for poor people who commit minor offenses to post bail, while at the same time make it more difficult for those charged with violent crimes to get out of jail while they await trial. \u201cWe simply can\u2019t allow the \u2026 treatment of nonviolent, low-income offenders to continue to be the victim of politics and procrastination,\u201d he said Wednesday in an appearance with African-American mayors, reverends and nonprofit leaders. He mentioned the legislation is supported by the NAACP and the American Civil Liberties Union. Paul has also been actively pushing for lighter sentences for drug offenders. While he makes the same economic argument as Christie, his bigger focus is on addressing racial inequalities in the criminal justice system. \u201cThree out of four people in prison right now for nonviolent crimes are black or brown,\u201d Paul said at the National Urban League conference last week in Cincinnati. \u201cOur prisons are bursting with young men of color and our communities are full of broken families.\u201d The senator has been aggressively courting African-American voters since the 2012 presidential election, when Republican Mitt Romney only won 6% of the black vote. Paul introduced legislation last week to get rid of the 18:1 disparity in penalties between crack cocaine and powder cocaine. As of now, a person with one gram of crack, which is cheaper, would get the same penalty as someone caught with 18 grams of powder cocaine. He has also teamed up with Attorney General Eric Holder to push back against mandatory minimums for nonviolent drug offenders. \u201cAs conservatives, (Christie and Paul) see the enormous cost of the drug war, and see sentencing reform for nonviolent drug offenders as a way of addressing those costs,\u201d said Quinten Kidd, political science professor and director of the Wason Center for Public Policy at Christopher Newport University. \u201cBut they come to that position from different ideological places in the party \u2013 one from a libertarian place and the other from a small government, economic conservative place,\u201d he added. They\u2019re not the only potential 2016 Republicans making waves on this front. Former Gov. Mike Huckabee, Rep. Paul Ryan, Gov. Rick Perry, and Sen. Ted Cruz have spoken out about the issue or supported reform. But with their active travel schedules and high-profile speaking gigs, Paul and Christie are certainly two of the loudest GOP advocates on the issue. Minority outreach While Paul has generated a lot of publicity in his quest to court African-Americans, Christie has also said the party needs to adjust its approach, and he points to himself as the prime example of how to do that. Christie won 21% of New Jersey\u2019s black vote and 51% of the Hispanic vote in his re-election victory last year, and he says he did it by reaching out to nontraditional GOP voters. \u201cWe got to campaign in places where we\u2019re uncomfortable,\u201d Christie told reporters last week in Denver, while traveling as chairman of the Republican Governors Association. \u201cYou cannot get the vote of someone who doesn\u2019t think you care about them.\u201d Romney won a whopping 60% of the white vote in 2012, but still lost the general election \u2014 a huge sign that the demographics in the country are changing. \u201cEvery Republican candidate who\u2019s serious about winning a national election knows all about that and is doing whatever he or she can,\u201d said Whit Ayres, a political consultant whose firm does polling for Sen. Marco Rubio. The Florida senator is another potential White House contender courting nontraditional GOP voters. Paul has made minority outreach a staple of his message, and emphasizes each time that he\u2019s working with Democrats when he pushes legislation that aims to help African-Americans. \u201cYou go to a Republican event and it\u2019s all white people\u2014not because we\u2019re excluding anybody, but because we just haven\u2019t done a good enough job encouraging people to come into our party,\u201d he said in an April speech at Harvard. In the past 18 months, Paul has made multiple trips to historically black colleges and urban centers, preaching a pro-school choice position and holding meetings with students and school leaders. Last month, he helped open a Kentucky GOP office in a predominantly African-American area in Louisville, and last week he touted his support for voting rights and the Civil Rights Act before the National Urban League. Softer approach on social issues Social issues had a sizable role in 2012, both in the presidential contest, as well as congressional races. Following a string of controversial comments about contraception, abortion and rape by Republican candidates and supporters, Democrats spent millions to paint the GOP as anti-women. Some Republicans took notice, including, it seems, Christie. \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re getting pounded because of the social issues. I think we\u2019re getting pounded because of the way we present ourselves,\u201d Christie said last week in Aspen, answering a question about how to avoid the same 2012 dust-ups. Republicans need to tweak their \u201ctenor and tone,\u201d he added, while being more tolerant of other viewpoints at the same time. Paul has also taken a softer approach on controversial topics. \u201cI think Republicans could only win in general if they become more \u2018live and let live,\u2019\u201d he told Reason magazine earlier this month. In March, Paul said that in order for the party to grow, Republicans \u201cwill have to agree to disagree on social issues,\u201d mentioning same-sex marriage as an example. Christie made the same \u201cagree to disagree\u201d case when he traveled to Colorado last week and was pressed about his public opposition to recreational marijuana. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to stop in public life worrying about making everybody happy and faking it, like we\u2019re going to agree all the time. We\u2019re not going to agree all the time,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you\u2019re looking for a candidate who you\u2019re going to agree with 100% of the time, go home and look in the mirror.\u201d With that said, they\u2019ve still gone on record about where they stand on social issues. They\u2019re just not always eager to jump into large-scale debates that can sometimes dominate headlines. Christie, for example, at first declined to comment on the recent Supreme Court ruling on Obamacare\u2019s contraception coverage mandate for certain for-profit companies. Asked about it again a couple weeks later, he simply said he supported it. Christie and Paul seem to estimate that an \u201cagree to disagree\u201d approach is safe at times, but it also appears to be a natural fit for each politician, given their political backgrounds. \u201cPaul and Christie seem to be finding themselves on similar territory, but from different places on the ideological spectrum,\u201d said Kidd. \u201cPaul as a libertarian wouldn\u2019t normally focus on social issues and Christie as more of an economic Republican wouldn\u2019t either.\u201d Don\u2019t expect any kumbayas With both men highlighting their appeal among Democrats and independents, it\u2019s to their advantage to widen the party and include more nontraditional voters. But it\u2019s not unexpected for Republicans to try to augment that base. \u201cI think all the candidates want to expand the party,\u201d said longtime Republican operative Hogan Gidley. \u201cYou\u2019re not just running for president of the Republican Party, you have to appeal to all Americans.\u201d But politically, that may be one of the few areas in which Christie and Paul\u2019s interests intersect. They likely still view each other as their own antithesis, said O\u2019Connell and they will surely butt heads on a full slate of topics, such as foreign policy, government spending and civil liberties. \u201cYou\u2019re starting to see them relatively agree on some issues,\u201d he said. \u201cBut they\u2019re still perfect foils for one another.\u201d Opinion: 4 reasons Christie keeps moving forward",

CNN has learned that\u2019s because Justice Department lawyers in recent months have determined they no longer have legal authority to unilaterally assign poll observers after the Supreme Court ruling invalidating key sections of the Voting Rights Act.

A member of her local NAACP chapter, Griggs says she was told that she couldn\u2019t bring them water to drink or chairs to rest in. McDaniel: Cochran campaign 'race-baited' Jones: North Carolina is rigging the system Democrats likely swung GOP contest \u201cA poll watcher approached me and said, \u2018What are you doing?\u2019 He told me I couldn\u2019t do that. They thought we were trying to sway their votes by giving them water,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was really sad to me because it was like a reflection of the stories I heard from my grandmother and mother when they had to pay to vote. It was a reflection of everything our people have gone through.\u201d Griggs is one of the plaintiffs in a NAACP lawsuit about new Texas voting identification laws, regulations that are considered by some civil rights and liberties groups as among the nation\u2019s most restrictive. Civil rights groups in that state, and others, fear that election officials and poll watchers, empowered by those new laws will ratchet up the level of discrimination against minority voters. \u201cWe\u2019ve had a serious problem with elected officials discriminating against Latino and African-American voters. It\u2019s obvious that many officials cannot be expected to treat these voters fairly,\u201d said Gary Bledsoe, an attorney and president of the Texas NAACP. \u201cWhen you give them more power to reject black and Latino voters at the polls, that power will be exercised and the discrimination escalated.\u201d Key races to watch in 2014 Texas voting officials have said the state\u2019s new photo voter identification law will help tamp down fraud. \u201cThe U.S. Supreme Court has already ruled that voter ID laws do not suppress legal votes, but do help prevent illegal votes,\u201d Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott said last year, according to media reports. The hunt for fraud When they head to the polls in this fall\u2019s midterm elections, some voters in nearly half of the country will find it a lot tougher to cast ballots due to new voting laws, according to a new report by the Brennan Center for Justice. It is a legal think tank at New York University School of Law that has criticized the increase in what it sees as prohibitive voting measures. Most of the laws were approved by Republican-dominated legislatures and in states that saw greater minority voter turnout in the 2008 and 2012 general elections, the report found. Civil rights groups and voting rights advocates see the spate of new laws as a way to disenfranchise and intimidate minority voters and suppress turnout during high-stakes elections. Others support the changes and see the laws as the best way to preserve integrity in the voting process. Obama cracks 'birth certificate' joke Voter ID's, Cliven, and the Donald Voting rights vs. voter fraud Such groups as the grassroots Voter Integrity Project in North Carolina and True the Vote, a conservative group in Texas, supports citizen enforcement of the new voter laws, acts that often mean sifting through voter rolls and pounding on doors in search of fraud. True the Vote announced this week that it is suing the Mississippi secretary of state and that state\u2019s Republican Party over the right to look at the poll books and ballots in order to ensure that Democratic primary voters didn\u2019t also illegally vote in last month\u2019s Republican primary runoff. In Mississippi, voters who don\u2019t cast ballots in a primary election can vote in either party\u2019s runoff. Mississippi state Sen.

Thad Cochran last month, is citing what he sees as \u201cillegal\u201d and \u201cunethical\u201d behavior among African-American Democrats who cast ballots for the veteran lawmaker. McDaniel said many of those voters participated in the Democratic primary and  shouldn\u2019t have been allowed to vote in the Republican runoff. \u201cTrue the Vote has been inundated with reports from voters across Mississippi who are outraged to see the integrity of this election being undermined so that politicos can get back to business as usual. Enough is enough,\u201d True the Vote President Catherine Engelbrecht said in statement. Vigilante or vindicator? One man\u2019s bid to root out voter fraud Tough new laws The nation\u2019s new crop of voting laws run the gamut from dialing back early voting hours to new requirements for photo identification to stricter rules for voter registration. A few examples: Analysis: The politics of voter ID laws Lawsuits filed over N.C. Voter ID Law And, in at least seven states, including Arizona, Arkansas and North Carolina, suits challenging new voting restrictions are wending their way through state and federal courts and could potentially impact the outcome of the 2014 elections. \u201cThe rules of the game\u201d This all follows a U.S. Supreme Court decision last year striking down provisions of the Voting Rights Act, which required a number of states \u2014 many of them in the South \u2014 to get clearance from the Justice Department before changing their voting laws. Without that protection, voting rights advocates say, in states with a history of discriminatory voting practices against racial minorities those who seek to unduly influence elections will find it easier to suppress votes. 2012 increase in voting ID laws \u201cWe have seen a dramatic increase in politicians trying to manipulate the rules of the game in terms of making it harder for citizens to vote,\u201d said Myrna Perez, a senior counsel at NYU\u2019s Brennan Center for Justice. The flurry of new and more restrictive voter laws coincided with the 2010 elections and new Republican majorities that came into power, Perez said. In 2012, the increase in laws reached a fever pitch when 19 states put forth measures civil rights groups view as restrictive. Now, as the 2014 midterm elections loom, voting rights advocates point to scenarios in the 2000 and 2012 general elections in Florida, where there was confusion about voting methods, laws and long lines, as a model for what could happen elsewhere in the country. \u201cI guess you could say we\u2019re ahead of the curve on voter suppression,\u201d said Deirdre Macnab, president of the nonpartisan League of Women Voters of Florida adding that the state has since passed a series of election reform measures which have improved voting. \u201cWhen it comes to Florida, we first saw the impact of taking away days and times to vote. And the legislators were properly shamed and embarrassed. It\u2019s unfortunate that other states have to experience that.\u201d 2014 Midterm Elections ",

            "article_content": "Rand Paul got in some hot water over his 2010 comments about the Civil Rights Act Democrats will likely make the controversy a line of attack if he runs for president The Kentucky Republican is now trying to appeal to African-American voters Experts say he's made strides with his outreach efforts, but needs to keep it up Sen. Rand Paul marked the 50th anniversary of the Civil Rights Act at a ceremony this week honoring the late Maurice Rabb, a renowned ophthalmologist and civil rights leader. It was part of his aggressive outreach to African-Americans and other nontraditional GOP voters as he works to expand the Republican Party and as he crisscrosses the country laying groundwork for a potential presidential campaign. It\u2019s a community in which he has some fences to mend. While campaigning for the Senate four years ago, Paul sparked a firestorm for questioning parts of the historic law, especially its underpinnings that place restrictions on private property. The law gave the federal government too much power in telling business owners what they could and could not do, he argued. While he expressed strong abhorrence for racism, he said it was the job of communities, not the government, to fix discrimination in private places by boycotting such businesses. His argument lined up ideologically with his libertarian, limited-government leanings, but Democrats have used his comments to try to define him as a civil rights opponent. Paul is now considered a likely presidential contender. And as the most active Republican leader in the effort to recruit African-Americans to the GOP, his comments from four years ago have become a thorn in his side. Political strategists say the senator has gotten better at framing his arguments in a less divisive manner. But in order to lay to rest controversy over his 2010 remarks, he needs to keep doing what he\u2019s doing: Try to convince African-Americans and Democratic voters that he\u2019s an advocate for many of their views, and push his fellow Republicans to join him in the effort. \u201cIf we\u2019re going to be the white party, we\u2019re going to be the losing party,\u201d Paul said Tuesday at the Shelbyville Rotary Club while he was in town for the event honoring Rabb. Paul\u2019s questions about the law In April 2010, Paul was asked by the Louisville Courier-Journal about his thoughts on the Civil Rights Act. He hailed the law for striving to end discrimination in the public domain, but he didn\u2019t fully approve of the government\u2019s role in the process. \u201cI think it\u2019s a bad business decision to exclude anybody from your restaurant \u2014 but, at the same time, I do believe in private ownership,\u201d he said. He added that he agrees any publicly-funded entities should not be allowed to discriminate, but the law shouldn\u2019t necessarily apply to private businesses. \u201cAnd that\u2019s most of what I think the Civil Rights Act was about in my mind.\u201d So how would he resolve the problem? Consistent with his small-government philosophy, he said it should be up to the people to self-correct the issue. \u201cIn a free society, we will tolerate boorish people who have abhorrent behavior. But if we\u2019re civilized people, we publicly criticize that and don\u2019t belong to those groups, or don\u2019t associate with those people,\u201d he added. His comments were similar to the views of his father, former Rep. Ron Paul, who famously protested a 2004 vote in the House commemorating the 40th anniversary of the Civil Rights Act. The then-congressman said the law did not improve race relations, and it diminished individual liberty. Defending his father, Paul said the problem with the law was the unintended consequences it had on property rights. \u201cIt\u2019s not all about race relations. It is about controlling property, ultimately,\u201d he said on CNN in January 2012. But Patrick Maney, a history professor at Boston College, said the discussion around property rights was only a portion of the debate about the Civil Rights Act at the time of passage. \u201cSaying the Civil Rights Act was about property rights is sort of akin to those who say the Civil War was about states\u2019 rights,\u201d he said. \u201cThe main objection, especially among the most rabid opponents, was to racial integration, assimilation, and race mixing.\u201d \u2018Concerned about the ramifications\u2019 Paul also argued that the law set a dangerous precedent that\u2019s paved a way for other restrictions on businesses, such as calorie-count regulations and smoking bans. While visiting Howard University, a historically black college in Washington, Paul was questioned last year about his views on the law. He forcefully said he\u2019s never come \u201cout in opposition to the Civil Rights Act or ever introduced anything to alter the Civil Rights Act.\u201d Rather, he\u2019s been \u201cconcerned about the ramifications of certain parts of it beyond race, as they are now being applied to smoking, menus, listing calories and things on menus, and guns.\u201d But historians say there\u2019s no direct connection between the 1964 law and the federal regulations he mentioned. \u201cI see absolutely nothing in the Civil Rights Act as opposed to any other law which would lead to smoking bans,\u201d said Ed Dorn, a professor and former dean of the Lyndon B. John School of Public Affairs at the University of Texas at Austin. A more likely connection, Dorn added, would be linking smoking bans and menu restrictions to health laws mandating child vaccinations. There is one title (out of 11) in the law that addresses private businesses. It states that certain entities are exempt from the law, such as small bed-and-breakfast type facilities, known colloquially as \u201cMrs. Murphy\u2019s Boarding Houses,\u201d in which there are five or fewer bedrooms and where the owner is a full-time resident. In a May 2010 interview with MSNBC\u2019s Rachel Maddow, Paul famously suggested that if he were around in 1964, he \u201cwould have tried to modify that\u201d section of the law and \u201cthere would have been some discussion\u201d on property rights. The Washington Post in 2013 ran a fact-check of Paul\u2019s comments about the Civil Rights Act over the years and gave him three out of four Pinnochios for what they described as \u201crewriting history.\u201d \u201cIt would be better to own up to his mistake \u2014 if he now thinks it was one \u2014 rather than sugarcoat it,\u201d the article stated. An uphill battle Perhaps more than any other Republican politician, Paul has been actively trying to expand the GOP by making it more attractive to African-Americans. He started his outreach following the 2012 presidential election, when Republican Mitt Romney garnered only 6% of that vote. Paul has made multiple trips to historically black colleges and urban centers, preaching a pro-school choice position and holding meetings with students and school leaders. Last month he helped open a Kentucky GOP office in a predominantly African-American area in Louisville. In late July, he\u2019ll address the National Urban League in Cincinnati. And in Congress, he\u2019s working to restore voting rights for people convicted of nonviolent felonies, many of whom are minority voters, and he\u2019s pushed his idea of \u201ceconomic freedom zones\u201d that would focus on improving struggling communities in urban areas. \u201cI think you\u2019ll find nobody in Congress doing more for minority rights than me, right now. Republican or Democrat,\u201d Paul told reporters Tuesday in Shelbyville. Paul\u2019s policy messages will resonate with \u201cthe African-American of 2014,\u201d said Elroy Sailor, an African-American businessman who\u2019s traveled with the senator to urban areas and historically black schools \u2013 though he stressed historical issues were still important to the black community. Sailor said Paul\u2019s actions will ultimately speak louder than any comments he made in the past. \u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019s transcending a statement here, or a statement there,\u201d he argued, predicting Paul will win people over in the long run. \u201cI think you\u2019ll see a lot of Rand Paul Democrats.\u201d But Paul still faces an uphill battle in courting those voters. While he\u2019s reaching out to African-Americans on issues they care about, his political associations and ideology may be an obstacle for some. \u201cThe libertarian perspective has never been terribly strong in the African-American community precisely because it is tied to a private property argument that bears a very insidious connection to slavery and racial discrimination,\u201d said Dorn, the professor of public affairs, though he said he takes Paul at his word that the senator detests racism. \u201cVery few civil rights advocates have been libertarians,\u201d Dorn added, however. Learning a valuable lesson As Paul works to appeal to African-Americans on the policy front, he\u2019ll need to continue sharpening his message skills. \u201cHe learned a very, very valuable lesson: If it\u2019s too complicated to explain your position, you\u2019re probably in trouble,\u201d said GOP strategist Ford O\u2019Connell. He\u2019s tried to clean up and clarify his comments about the Civil Rights Act, and in May 2012, he told CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer that he would have voted for the bill in 1964 if he had the chance. He \u201cwould have been there marching with Martin Luther King\u201d during the civil rights movement, he said. In a statement this week on the anniversary, Paul said the law \u201cchanged the future of our nation by enforcing the belief that all men and women are created equal.\u201d When running for the Senate in 2010, Paul was considered a newcomer to politics. He had campaigned for his father\u2019s presidential bids and had been involved in political activism, but Rand Paul\u2019s Senate run was his first big campaign of his own. Strategists say his comments about the Civil Rights Act were a rookie mistake; Paul, who had been a practicing ophthalmologist for 17 years, wasn\u2019t quite ready for the sound-bite friendly media. If Paul runs for president, Democrats are almost certain to make sure his comments about the Civil Rights Act overshadow any other efforts he\u2019s made to appeal to African Americans. On Tuesday for example, the Democratic National Committee quickly pounced on the statement Paul released on the anniversary. In an email blast, the DNC reminded people of his Louisville Courier-Journal interview. Paul is \u201cnow trying to have it both ways,\u201d the email stated. \u201cNo rhetoric can erase the number of instances where Paul has turned his back on the Civil Rights Act that\u2019s created a more fair and just America,\u201d it continued. The response offered a glimpse at how Democrats plan to target the likely presidential candidate. From a strategy standpoint, O\u2019Connell said Paul has \u201cgotten a lot better\u201d at talking to the media and it\u2019s \u201cwise\u201d for him to be active in appealing to the African-American community, not only for his own political future, but for the Republican Party as a whole. \u201cHis job between now and then is to continue what he\u2019s doing with minority outreach and try to bury this every way possible,\u201d he said.",

            "article_content": "Summaries of some big cases decided by the Supreme Court this term: Affirmative action Schuette v. Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action, Integration & Immigrant Rights, and Fight for Equality by Any Means Necessary Regulating racism? Issue: Whether a state violates the Equal Protection Clause by amending its constitution to prohibit race- and sex-based discrimination or preferential treatment in public-university admissions decisions. Involves Michigan\u2019s controversial voter-approved law. Ruling: 6-2 for the state, upholding a Michigan law banning the use of racial criteria in college admissions. The majority said a lower court did not have the authority to set aside the measure approved in a 2006 referendum supported by 58% of voters. It bars publicly funded colleges from granting \u201cpreferential treatment to any individual or group on the basis of race, sex, color, ethnicity or national origin.\u201d Impact: A key decision in an unfolding legal and political battle nationally over affirmative action. The debate in recent years has centered around whether and when such programs \u2013 while constitutionally permissible now \u2013 would eventually have to be phased out as the goal of obtaining diversity is met. Campaign donations McCutcheon v. FEC Big money goes before the Supreme Court Issue: Constitutionality of a two-year ceiling on campaign donations to federal candidates. Ruling: 5-4 for McCutcheon, eliminating limits on how much money people can donate in total in one federal election season. The appeal comes from Alabama businessman and donor Shaun McCutcheon, supported in court by the Republican National Committee. They object to a 1970s-era law restricting someone from giving no more than $48,600 to federal candidates, and $74,600 to political action committees, during a two-year election cycle. McCutcheon says he has a constitutional right to donate over that amount to as many candidates as he wants, so long as no one candidate gets more than the current $2,600 limit. But the law\u2019s supporters worry millions of dollars could easily be funneled by a single well-heeled donor to his or her party and candidates of choice, reviving a system of \u201clegalized bribery.\u201d Impact: This decision left intact the current $5,200 limit on how much an individual can give to any single candidate during a two-year election cycle. Until now, an individual donor could give up to $123,200 per cycle. The ruling means a wealthy liberal or conservative donor can give as much money as desired to federal election candidates across the country, as long as no candidate receives more than the $5,200 cap. While most people lack the money to make such a large total donation to election campaigns, the ruling clears the way for more private money to enter the system. In effect, it expands the loosening of campaign finance laws that occurred with the high court\u2019s Citizens United decision in 2010 that eased campaign spending by outside groups. Church and state Town of Greece, N.Y., v. Galloway Supreme Court rules on prayer at meetings Issue: Public prayer in town meetings. A federal appeals court found the practice an unconstitutional mix of church and state, but local officials call it highly inclusive, allowing practicing Wiccans and atheists to offer \u201ccivic prayers.\u201d Ruling: 5-4 for the town, citing the country\u2019s history of religious acknowledgment in the legislature, which include local citizen-participation meetings. Impact: Another contentious case over the intersection of faith and the civic arena. It was confined to the specific circumstances and offered few bright-line rules on how other communities should offer civic prayers without violating the Constitution. Executive power NLRB v. Noel Canning Obama loses recess appointments case Issue: The validity of President Barack Obama\u2019s recess appointments to a federal agency. A U.S. appeals court panel concluded three people named to the NLRB lacked authority, because the presidential appointments were made while the Senate was technically in a \u201cpro forma\u201d session during the winter holiday break. That board had ruled on a Washington state labor dispute, but the canning company claims its members did not have a proper quorum. Ruling: 9-0 for the company, that officials named in a brief \u201cpro forma\u201d session were not proper, but that recess appointments would be valid if those breaks lasted 10 days or more. Impact: Surprising unanimity in a narrowly drawn opinion. The court\u2019s opinion will not have an immediate effect, since Democrats controlling the Senate imposed rules making it harder for Republicans to block Obama\u2019s nominees. But a change in Senate control after November\u2019s midterm elections could renew the disagreements. Health care reform-contraception Burwell v. Hobby Lobby Stores, Inc.; and Conestoga Wood Specialties Corp. v. Burwell Supreme Court in favor of Hobby Lobby Issue: Do the religious owners of a family business, or their closely held, for-profit corporation, have free exercise rights that are violated by the application of the contraceptive-coverage mandate of the Affordable Care Act?  Does federal law allow a for-profit corporation to deny its employees the contraceptive coverage? Ruling: 5-4 for companies, a legal and political setback for a controversial part of Obama\u2019s health care reform law. Impact: The immediate practical result will likely be an administrative fix by the Obama administration that subsidizes the contraceptives at issue, but further legal challenges over the employer mandate continue working their way through the lower courts. Also likely to set off a frenzied partisan debate that will continue through the November congressional elections and beyond over religious and reproductive rights. Cellphone searches U.S. v. Wurie; and Riley v. California Ruling: Warrant needed to search phones Issue: Whether police must obtain a warrant to search data on the cellphone of a person under arrest. Criminal suspects in Massachusetts and California were convicted, in part, after phone numbers, text messages, and addresses obtained from personal electronic devices linked them to criminal drug and gang activity. Ruling: 9-0 for defendants, a sweeping endorsement for privacy rights. Impact: Surprisingly strong unanimity from the court, and a setback for law enforcement and the federal government. A January Pew Research Center survey found more than 90 percent of Americans now own or regularly use a cellphone, and 58 percent have a more sophisticated smartphone. They have become the most quickly adopted technology ever. It\u2019s estimated that most of the world\u2019s 7 billion people have access to mobile devices, according to the United Nations.",

            "article_content": "Runoff turnout shot up in counties with the highest African-American populations \"This is how you grow the party,\" head of a pro-Cochran super PAC said Several GOP strategists said Cochran's coalition was unique to Mississippi Democrats targeting minority communities hoping to increase midterm turnout An unlikely group helped Sen. Thad Cochran capture the Republican nomination in a hotly contested primary runoff, but the strategy that propelled him to victory is unlikely to make it into the GOP playbook. In the final weeks of the election, Cochran\u2019s campaign and allies turned to African-Americans and Democrats to carry the incumbent senator past his tea party challenger. Turnout shot up in counties with the highest African-American populations, but Cochran\u2019s success with turning out an unlikely demographic will be hard to replicate elsewhere, several Republican strategists said. CNN political commentator and Republican strategist Kevin Madden emphasized that each election should be treated as an independent race with its own strategy. \u201cI think it would be hard to say this is a sign of something that could be replicated in congressional districts or in races around the country,\u201d Madden, a former adviser to 2012 GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney, said. A unique scenario played out in Mississippi: Because of the state\u2019s open primary system, Democrats were able to help elect the Republican nominee, who is all but certain to win the general election in the solidly Republican state. The contentious race between an incumbent with a pipeline to federal funds and a more conservative challenger with tea party backing jolted blacks into action \u2013 88% of whom voted for the Democratic nominee in the state\u2019s last Senate race in 2012, according to CNN exit polls. Lifelong Democrats mobilized for Cochran States in which the same scenario could play out \u201care few and far between,\u201d GOP strategist and CNN political commentator Alex Castellanos said. \u201cUntil we find such a rare state, it will do a Republican no good to promise more federal spending and benefits to minority voters.\u201d Bringing home the pork Throughout the campaign, Cochran consistently pointed out his position on the  Senate Appropriations Committee and the multimillion-dollar projects he has funded in Mississippi, some of which bear his name, like the University of Southern Mississippi\u2019s Thad Cochran Center. Jackson, Mississippi, also boasts the Jackson Medical Mall Thad Cochran Center \u2013 a formerly run-down mall that an African-American doctor converted into a medical center with Cochran\u2019s support, said D\u2019Andra Orey, political science professor at Jackson State University. \u201cHe\u2019s done some things that are not black-specific, but things that blacks benefit from,\u201d Orey said. Many credited Cochran\u2019s success at the ballot box to his ability to funnel federal dollars into his state \u2013 the poorest in the country. Democrats likely swung GOP contest McDaniel: Miss. election not fair Tea party leader dead in apparent suicide Henry Barbour, who steered the pro-Cochran super PAC Mississippi Conservatives, said that Cochran\u2019s long-standing relationships with the African-American community and ability to meet \u201cthe needs of all the Mississippians\u201d helped Cochran win. \u201cIt only worked because they had confidence in Sen. Cochran, whether it was a Republican voter we were talking to, an independent voter we were talking to, or even a Democratic voter,\u201d Barbour acknowledged. But still, Barbour said he does not \u201cthink there\u2019s any question\u201d that the strategy can be applied on a national level. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to genuinely go into the minority communities and communicate our message and explain to them why it\u2019s good for them,\u201d Barbour said. Barbour called the election an impressive feat given the state\u2019s violent history of race relations. Turnout spiked in Hinds County, which is 70% African-American and saw about 7,000 more voters for Cochran in the runoff than in the primary. While boasting a similar share of Cochran supporters, neighboring Madison County \u2013 which is 38% African-American \u2013 delivered much smaller gains for Cochran in the runoff. George Flaggs Jr., the mayor of Vicksburg, backed Cochran and encouraged other Democrats to support him at the polls, largely because his city\u2019s economy is anchored in government-funded projects. \u201c(Sen. Cochran) is a person that demonstrates leadership in terms of helping with jobs and job creation,\u201d Flaggs said. \u201cI\u2019m a black Democrat, but I try to be responsive to the needs of the city and the state.\u201d He added that Mississippi would be unable to compete for federal funds with states like New York or California without Cochran\u2019s seniority in the Senate. Barbour said he was \u201cdamned proud\u201d to ask African-Americans and Democrats for their support. \u201cOne of the highlights of the runoff was working with African-Americans in a shared interest in our state,\u201d Barbour said. \u201cThis is how you grow the party.\u201d Conservative activists slam Cochran for courting Democrats Is the African-American vote up for grabs? ConservativeBlackChick.com\u2019s Crystal Wright said the Mississippi race showed that neither party should take the black vote for granted. \u201cWe don\u2019t go out and earn the black vote,\u201d Wright said of the GOP. \u201cThe only time the Republican Party is serious about going after the black vote is \u2013 it\u2019s like the vote of last resort. Blacks have become the vote of last resort and we need to say no more.\u201d Republicans could actually make inroads with African-Americans in the rural and suburban communities of the South, said Ravi K. Perry, a political science professor at Mississippi State University. Perry, who has written extensively about race in politics, said Cochran\u2019s outreach to blacks is \u201cobviously a winning strategy\u201d and that the runoff showed that there is interest in the African-American community to have an impact on the political process. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to be a strategy that you\u2019re going to throw away,\u201d Perry said. He added that many African-Americans are socially conservative and may find Republican candidates appealing, particularly if they can bring home federal dollars for the agriculture industry, which relies on subsidies. Ryan, Paul reach out to African Americans Sen. Paul pushes felons' voting rights \u201cDemocrats should not rest on their laurels and assume that the African-American vote is theirs and the GOP should not assume that it is out of their reach,\u201d Perry said. Democratic strategist and CNN political commentator Donna Brazile dispelled the idea that Democrats take the African-American vote for granted and said that Democrats are working to recruit and turn out more every election cycle. \u201cThe only legitimate criticism \u2026 is that we wait until the last minute to encourage African-Americans to vote,\u201d Brazile said. \u201cBut when it comes to encouraging African-Americans to run for office, we\u2019re at the table.\u201d But Brazile said the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee is making an \u201caggressive effort\u201d to recruit and register African-Americans and other minorities in key states this cycle DSCC National Press Secretary Justin Barasky said the group is already spending to raise turnout in battleground states to near-2012 levels and will be \u201cmaking an unprecedented investment\u201d to keep the Senate in Democratic hands. Registering and turning out African-Americans will be a key part of this strategy, particularly in Georgia, South Carolina and Louisiana, Barasky said. Forming a more inclusive party Danny Vargas, former chairman of the Republican National Hispanic Assembly, was wary to draw any broader conclusions from the unique Mississippi runoff, but said the race is a reminder the GOP needs to cast a wider net. \u201cNationally, if we ever hope to win back the White House, we need to have an approach that\u2019s inclusive of every segment of society,\u201d Vargas, who is also president of VARCom Solutions, said. \u201cThe poor of our country are not the problem, they\u2019re the ones most in need of our solutions.\u201d Vargas suggested the GOP should show how its market-oriented solutions can empower all types of communities. \u201cYou just need to show up. You need to be willing to go to Hispanic bodegas, black churches or mosques,\u201d he said. Beyond African-Americans, Republicans will also need to draw Hispanic voters to remain a viable party as that population is projected to triple by 2050. John Bruce, chair of the University of Mississippi\u2019s political science department, called the runoff an \u201cexceptional\u201d case and said no one should expect any significant shifts in racial partisanship. But Cochran\u2019s strategy of courting the African-American vote proved successful \u2013 whether because of his record of funding projects in Mississippi or the fear of being represented by someone like McDaniel. \u201cAnytime something works in politics, someone else will try to copy it,\u201d Bruce said.

            "article_content": "Sec. Kerry takes heat for saying what some Israeli leaders have expressed Critics call Kerry's remarks \"undiplomatic,\" \"ill-advised\" The backlash reflects U.S. election-year politics and the volatile Middle East conflict State Department: Kerry used the wrong word to make his point John Kerry wasn\u2019t the first to use the A-word \u2013 apartheid \u2013 when talking about Israel, and he likely won\u2019t be the last. Even some Israeli leaders have mentioned the word that basically means \u201cseparate\u201d in describing the eventual result if a Jewish state had a Palestinian majority in some areas, such as currently exists in the West Bank. However, the U.S. secretary of state touched a diplomatic live wire last week when he predicted an apartheid situation if Israel and the Palestinians fail to agree on a two-state solution for their decades-long conflict. Republican Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas, a tea party favorite and possible presidential candidate, called for Kerry\u2019s resignation, while pro-Israel groups accused America\u2019s top diplomat of inappropriate language and insensitivity. Kerry regrets Israel apartheid comment Kerry warns of Mideast 'Apartheid' Hamas, Fatah end 'era of division' The backlash reflected both the hyper-partisanship of a U.S. election year and the high stakes of Middle East peace talks pushed by Kerry that have effectively broken down in the latest episode of a dispute that seems to define the word intractable. \u201cUnwise, ill-timed and ill-advised\u201d \u201cThis was unwise, ill-timed and ill-advised for sure, but it\u2019s not going to make much of a difference frankly in the overall arc of the process that\u2019s promising only diminishing returns,\u201d said Aaron David Miller, a former U.S. negotiator on the Israel-Palestinian issue. Kerry issued a statement on Monday acknowledging he used the wrong word in comments to a closed-door meeting of the Trilateral Commission of private sector leaders from North America, Europe and Asia. At the same time, he  vigorously defended his long-held support for Israel and commitment to finding a two-state solution to the Middle East conflict. \u201cI will not allow my commitment to Israel to be questioned by anyone, particularly for partisan, political purposes, so I want to be crystal clear about what I believe and what I don\u2019t believe,\u201d he said. \u201cI have been around long enough to also know the power of words to create a mis-impression, even when unintentional, and if I could rewind the tape, I would have chosen a different word to describe my firm belief that the only way in the long term to have a Jewish state and two nations and two peoples living side by side in peace and security is through a two-state solution,\u201d he added. Apartheid was the reviled system of racial segregation implemented by the white-minority government in South Africa for decades before the country transitioned to a multiparty democracy that was first led by Nelson Mandela. A series of laws determined where black South Africans could live, work and go to school, who they could marry, and even which beaches they could use. The intent was to maintain power for the white minority while stripping blacks of all rights of citizenship. In the rhetoric of the Middle East dispute, Palestinian nationalists and others have accused Israel of apartheid-like policies, an accusation vehemently denied by Israeli authorities. Palestinians with citizenship rights comprise a minority of Israel\u2019s population, but non-citizen Palestinians in the West Bank and other territories face severe security restrictions that limit their movement and other basic freedoms. Palestinians in Israel Some Israeli officials have acknowledged that failure to reach a peace agreement that creates a Palestinian state alongside the Jewish state would result in non-Israeli Palestinians living in Israel without the same rights as Israeli citizens, including the right to vote. \u201cAs long as in this territory west of the Jordan River there is only one political entity called Israel, it is going to be either non-Jewish or non-democratic,\u201d former Prime Minister Ehud Barak said in 2010 when he was defense minister. \u201cIf this bloc of millions of Palestinians cannot vote, that will be an apartheid state.\u201d Other Israelis who have warned about a future apartheid state include former Prime Minister Ehud Olmert and Justice Minister Tzipi Livni, the government\u2019s chief negotiator. Kerry\u2019s statement cited such comments, saying that \u201cin the long term, a unitary, binational state cannot be the democratic Jewish state that Israel deserves or the prosperous state with full rights that the Palestinian people deserve.\u201d Like Kerry, Israeli officials also have warned of potential increased violence from a growing Palestinian independence movement without a two-state agreement, as well as possible increased international condemnation for the situation on the ground. Tuesday was the nine-month deadline Kerry set last year for coming up with some form of agreement in the talks. Despite Kerry\u2019s repeated trips to the region to try to push the negotiations forward, the process hit a road block last week when the Palestinians announced they would combine rival movements Fatah and Hamas to form a unity government. Israel\u2019s Security Cabinet subsequently announced the country won\u2019t hold talks with a Palestinian government that includes Hamas, which the United States considers a terrorist organization. International pressure Palestinian negotiator Saeb Erekat issued a statement Tuesday that blamed Israel for the breakdown in the talks and said \u201cwe believe that the international community must now do what is needed, in order to make clear to Israel that choosing settlements and apartheid over peace has a political, legal and economic cost.\u201d Kerry\u2019s controversial comments were reported Sunday by the Daily Beast, based on a secret recording of his remarks. Before his statement Monday that served as confirmation of the Daily Beast report, critics attacked. The American Israel Public Affairs Committee called the apartheid remark \u201cdeeply troubling,\u201d while Abraham Foxman, national director of the Anti-Defamation League, issued a statement calling reports that Kerry used such language \u201cstartling and deeply disappointing.\u201d \u201cEven if he used the repugnant language of Israel\u2019s adversaries and accusers to express concern for Israel\u2019s future, it was undiplomatic, unwise and unfair,\u201d Foxman said. \u201cSuch references are not seen as expressions of friendship and support.\u201d House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, a Virginia Republican who is the highest-ranking Jewish member of Congress, said the word apartheid \u201chas routinely been dismissed as both offensive and inaccurate, and Secretary Kerry\u2019s use of it makes peace even harder to achieve.\u201d Cruz said Kerry should step down because \u201cthere is no place for this word in the context of the state of Israel.\u201d On Tuesday, other Republicans also weighed in. \u201cThe secretary of state of the United States \u2013 his words or her words \u2013 carry great weight,\u201d GOP Sen. John Barrasso of Wyoming told MSNBC. \u201cAnd I think what the secretary said was hurtful and harmful and he should have apologized.\u201d U.S. politics at play Some Democrats also criticized Kerry. Alaska Sen. Mark Begich chided him for improperly expressing his frustration over the foundering peace talks. Begich faces a tough re-election race in November in his traditionally Republican state. Support for Israel is an essential policy for candidates seeking to win votes from the political right and center. Meanwhile, some pro-Israel voices backed Kerry\u2019s analysis of the situation. In a statement on its website, the U.S. group J Street said \u201cIsrael today is not an apartheid state, and that\u2019s not what Secretary of State Kerry said.\u201d \u201cFor over a year now, Kerry has argued that, without a two-state solution, Israel is risking its future and its values as it moves toward permanent rule over millions of Palestinians without equal rights,\u201d said the J Street statement. \u201cFormer Prime Ministers Ehud Barak and Ehud Olmert have used the \u2018apartheid\u2019 term as well to describe this possible future. Instead of putting energy into attacking Secretary Kerry, those who are upset with the secretary\u2019s use of the term should put their energy into opposing and changing the policies that are leading Israel down this road.\u201d At the State Department on Tuesday, spokeswoman Jen Psaki made a similar point when reporters grilled her about whether Kerry\u2019s statement the night before amounted to an apology. \u201cHe still believes that, as many Israeli officials have stated, there would be challenges to a unitary state,\u201d Psaki said. Former President Jimmy Carter came under similar criticism when he published a book on the Middle East conflict titled \u201cPalestine: Peace, Not Apartheid\u201d in 2006. \u201cMost of the criticisms of the book have been the one word in the title, \u2018apartheid,\u2019 \u201d Carter said in 2007, adding that the \u201cmandatory separation\u201d inside the Palestinian territories and \u201cterrible persecution and oppression of the Palestinians by the Israelis\u201d was \u201ca basic issue that has got to be corrected before Israel can have peace.\u201d READ: Israeli PM Netanyahu: No peace talks if Abbas is backed by Hamas CNN\u2019s Laura Koran and Dana Davidsen contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Politicians back away from Cliven Bundy's comments on blacks, welfare and slaves Bundy, Ted Nugent and Phil Robertson have all echoed similarly insensitive sentiments Experts on race and politics say such comments speak to an active fringe element in America Politicians must tread carefully, experts say, in embracing such cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bres Nevada rancher Cliven Bundy\u2019s remarks about whether \u201cthe Negro\u201d fared better under slavery represents the latest in a series of incendiary racial comments from a new crop of folk heroes embraced in some conservative circles. \u201cThey abort their young children, they put their young men in jail, because they never learned how to pick cotton,\u201d Bundy said to reporters, according to The New York Times. \u201cAnd I\u2019ve often wondered, are they better off as slaves, picking cotton and having a family life and doing things, or are they better off under government subsidy? They didn\u2019t get no more freedom. They got less freedom,\u201d he was quoted as saying. Bundy, 67, a rancher whose much-publicized land dispute with the federal government endeared him to conservatives, defended his comments as idle thoughts. \u201cIn my mind I\u2019m wondering, are they better off being slaves, in that sense, or better off being slaves to the United States government, in the sense of the subsidies? I\u2019m wondering. That\u2019s what. And the statement was right. I am wondering,\u201d he said Thursday on \u201cThe Peter Schiff Show.\u201d Bundy: I spoke from my heart GOP running from Bundy's comments Tensions escalate: Rancher defies feds Bundy stood by those comments in interviews with CNN on Thursday and Friday. That defense included a tense exchange Friday morning with \u201cNew Day\u201d anchor Chris Cuomo. \u201cMaybe I sinned \u2026 and maybe I don\u2019t know what I actually said. \u2026 If I say Negro or black or slave \u2026 if those people cannot take those kind of words and not be (offended), then Martin Luther King hasn\u2019t got his job done yet. \u2026 We need to get over this prejudice stuff,\u201d Bundy said. \u201cI don\u2019t think I\u2019m wrong,\u201d he also told CNN\u2019s Bill Weir on Thursday night. \u201cI think I\u2019m right.\u201d But politicians such as Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky, a potential 2016 presidential GOP contender, Republican Sen. Dean Heller of Nevada and other conservatives scrambled to distance themselves from the controversy. Media and Cliven Bundy \u201cHis remarks on race are offensive and I wholeheartedly disagree with him,\u201d Paul said in a statement. Heller \u201ccompletely disagrees with Mr. Bundy\u2019s appalling and racist statements, and condemns them in the most strenuous way,\u201d according to his spokesman, Chandler Smith. The Republican National Committee said Bundy\u2019s comments were \u201ccompletely beyond the pale. Both highly offensive and 100% wrong on race.\u201d But experts on race and politics say the comments, much like those of rocker Ted Nugent, who created a firestorm when he called President Barack Obama a \u201csubhuman mongrel,\u201d also speak to complicated and deeply fraught cultural tensions running beneath the surface in some segments of America. \u201cWe are looking at some of the \u2018last white men standing,\u2019 \u201d Mark Anthony Neal, an African-American studies professor at Duke University, said of demographic shifts that show minorities now represent more than half of the nation\u2019s population born in 2010 and 2011, according to the most recent census data. \u201cHis comments represent that, and people rally around him because of this idea that white men are under siege. They are calling out the political establishment to stand by them,\u201d he said. Over the next several generations, political experts say minority voters will become more of a power base in the Deep South, the Southwest and in California. Two senators face off over rancher Reid: Ranchers \"domestic terrorists\" Feds and cattle rancher face off Photos: Showdown in Nevada During the 2012 presidential election, Republicans faced huge losses among minorities and women, prompting the GOP to re-examine outreach to those groups. But Bundy\u2019s comments \u2013 much like those of Nugent and \u201cDuck Dynasty \u201d star Phil Robertson, who shared during an interview with GQ last year pastoral recollections of blacks \u201csinging and happy\u201d as he and his family worked alongside them in Louisiana cotton fields \u2013 speak to a certain politically active fringe element, political experts say. Among those who support views of limited government, there is often a \u201chigher than average endorsement of views that could be seen as racial resentment,\u201d said Andra Gillespie, an associate professor of political science at Emory University. \u201cWhat this reflects is that there are groups of people who have not been accepted by politically correct circles and have never learned to frame their comments in a palatable fashion. They take pride in that,\u201d Gillespie said. \u201cThe articulation of their views is somewhat fringe, but the underlying attitude is not. They are a minority viewpoint, but they are a large minority.\u201d And that\u2019s put politicians who have previously embraced men such as Bundy, Nugent and Robertson as cause c\u00e9l\u00e8bres in an awkward position. For instance, Texas Attorney General Greg Abbott, his state\u2019s Republican nominee for governor, took heat from some quarters when Nugent appeared at a campaign event for him this year. Abbott\u2019s campaign said it did not endorse Nugent\u2019s comments. Other Republicans viewed as potential presidential candidates, including Sen. Ted Cruz of Texas and the state\u2019s governor, Rick Perry, also distanced themselves from Nugent\u2019s remarks. Paul said an apology was in order, which Nugent eventually offered for using the term. Conservative radio host Sean Hannity said on his show that he worries Democrats will now use Bundy\u2019s \u201crepugnant\u201d and \u201cdespicable\u201d comments to paint everyone on the far right as racists. The Democratic National Committee pounced on Bundy\u2019s remarks. \u201cIf you ever want to be taken seriously for your outreach efforts, you might want to start by not defending racists,\u201d DNC spokesman Mo Elleithee said in a statement.

            "article_content": "Sebelius became the face of Obamacare's rocky roll out Officials: Sebelius told Obama in March that she would resign Sebelius was a two-term governor in largely Republican Kansas Sebelius called her time in D.C. \"the most meaningful work I've ever been a part of\" Shortly after Kathleen Sebelius was tapped to carry out President Barack Obama\u2019s signature health care reform effort, the head of Health and Human Services found herself in the crosshairs of Republicans determined to repeal the law. The two-term Kansas governor-turned-Obamacare-chief-defender is resigning as health secretary. She\u2019s leaving after a problem-plagued rollout of HealthCare.gov, the federal website portal critical to the law\u2019s implementation, but with the administration taking a victory lap after unexpectedly reaching and then exceeding its sign-up target of 7 million. Obamacare hits 7.5 million sign-ups, Sebelius says A tweet by David Axelrod, former senior adviser to Obama, perhaps best sums up the tension Sebelius faced as she tried to navigate implementing the controversial law familiar as Obamacare. \u201cWhen all is said and done, Sebelius has lots to be proud of including the surprisingly strong finish on exchange signups after a rocky start,\u201d Axelrod wrote. That sentiment is \u201ca little passive aggressive,\u201d said Ryan Lizza, a CNN political commentator. Sebelius resigns, replacement nominated \u201cThey want the message to be: blame Sebelius with the problems with Obamacare especially as they go into a midterm election where this is going to be a big issue. I think that\u2019s a little unfair to her.\u201d WH: Kathleen Sebelius to resign Inside Politics: Sebelius, Bush, Holder Sebelius pays price for botched rollout? It wasn\u2019t always this way. She once was seen as a Democratic Party rising star when she was tapped to deliver the Democratic response to President George W. Bush\u2019s final State of the Union address. She was the Midwestern girl whose political blood ran blue but flourished in a red state.  Her father was a former Democratic governor of Ohio. She was a fan of NASCAR and college sports, running and the Rolling Stones. She ran for the governor\u2019s office with promises to improve government efficiency and create a more business-friendly climate within the state. She navigated a judicial order to boost school spending during a time when her state was facing one of its worst budget crises since the Great Depression. She was also able to help lead the state to an economic recovery and lower unemployment, according to the state\u2019s website at the time. In 2008, Newsweek magazine called her \u201cone to watch\u201d and Time magazine dubbed her one of four \u201crising stars from the heartland,\u201d and put on the short list as one of the country\u2019s five best governors. Democratic blogger Markos Moulitsas in 2006 predicted on his Daily Kos Web site that Sebelius would be on the shortlist for vice president on the party\u2019s ticket. He also gave her kudos for wooing frustrated Kansas Republicans. She wasn\u2019t Obama\u2019s first choice to head Health and Human Services \u2013 Sen. Tom Daschle of South Dakota was forced to withdraw over a controversy with his tax records and questions about work some considered lobbying. It was hoped that her background as someone who worked across the aisle could help Obama as he set about the herculean task of health care reform. Despite an initial controversy over what she called \u201cunintentional errors\u201d in tax returns and pushback from both pro-life and pro-choice advocates, she sailed through Senate confirmation on a 65-31 vote. GOP senator: Sebelius the \u2018laughingstock of America\u2019 As the Affordable Care Act neared implementation, she faced increasing scrutiny from Republican members of Congress who wanted to forestall Obamacare\u2019s momentum. That pressure and criticism only increased after the mandate became law in 2010 without Republican support. She, her agency and the administration faced blistering criticism about the law\u2019s legality \u2013 challenges that were decided by the Supreme Court. She was routinely grilled at congressional hearings about whether the law could be implemented on time, was financially sustainable and if the administration would hit enrollment targets. And she was hammered in hearings over the Web portal\u2019s disastrous roll out in October. HHS chief: President didn\u2019t know of Obamacare website woes beforehand There were calls for her resignation from a number of House Republicans and several senators amid the HealthCare.gov debacle. Obamacare enrollment eventually exceeded its target of 7 million \u2013 but not without a last-minute surge in the days before the deadline in March. And senior administration officials say Sebelius told the President last month that it would reach its goal and that would be a good time for her to go. The Obama official said Sebelius\u2019 decision to leave had little to do with the initial uproar over the website. A White House official praised her overseeing \u201cone of the most consequential initiatives of this administration\u201d as well as her efforts to \u201cimprove children\u2019s health, expand mental health care, reduce racial and ethnic disparities, bring us closer to the first AIDS-free generation and promote women\u2019s health.\u201d Republicans paid her backhanded compliments. \u201cShe had an impossible task: nobody can make Obamacare work,\u201d House Majority Leader Eric Cantor tweeted. Obama acknowledged the botched rollout of the enrollment website under Sebelius\u2019 watch. \u201cShe\u2019s got bumps. I\u2019ve got bumps, bruises,\u201d he said on Friday. But \u201cthe final score speaks for itself.\u201d But some see the administration\u2019s handling of Sebelius\u2019 departure as damning with faint praise. \u201cI mean, this is one of those classic Washington dances where the administration praises the person but the at the same time you want the message to sort of suddenly be that we weren\u2019t so happy with what she did and this \u2013 and we couldn\u2019t of course get rid of her when the website was a disaster, right,\u201d Lizza said. Members of her party back in her home state told the Kansas City Star they were stunned by Sebelius\u2019 move but could well understand her motivation. \u201cI think she has had the toughest job in Washington over the past four years,\u201d Jim Slattery, a former congressman and U.S. Senate candidate, told the paper. \u201cShe has done a good job under the worst possible circumstances you can imagine.\u201d Sebelius told the Star in an interview on Thursday that she always knew she would not \u201cbe here to turn out the lights in 2017.\u201d During Friday\u2019s event, where Obama also nominated her successor, Sebelius stood next to the President. And she described her time as health secretary as \u201cthe most meaningful work I\u2019ve ever been a part of.\u201d She leaves the job in May.

Rand Paul, nodding her head and listening as he pressed the case with Kentucky state senators to restore felon voting rights. \u201cKids do make mistakes. White kids make mistakes. Black kids make mistakes.  Brown kids make mistakes,\u201d Paul told the Kentucky state Senate committee considering a constitutional amendment to restore the voting rights of some felons on Wednesday. \u201cBut when you look at the prison population, three out of the four people in prison are black or brown.\u201d Fogle whispered: \u201cGood for you. I\u2019m glad someone is speaking up.\u201d She felt as if he was narrating her life. In 1991, the former University of Kentucky basketball team captain received a 10-year sentence for crack cocaine possession. Since her release, she has been unable to vote. \u201cI remember when my mom showed me how to vote for the very first time. I remember watching the movies of my ancestors getting mauled by dogs and water hoses,\u201d Fogle said, her voice cracking a bit. \u201cIt changed my life completely. I was an embarrassment to my family. My community.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m not making any excuses for my behavior. Should I have gotten a 10-year sentence? Yes, I should have. Have I served my time? Yes, I have.\u201d Holder calls for restoring ex-cons\u2019 voting rights Who is Rand Paul? Holder pushes plan to let ex-cons vote Sen. Rand Paul slams Clinton again Rand Paul's rise to power The issue of restoring felon voting rights has made for some unusual alliances as former felons, like Fogle, see in lawmakers like Paul, a tea party-backed Republican, a champion. Nationally, about 5.8 million people are prohibited from voting because of current or previous felony convictions, according to Attorney Gen. Eric Holder. In the swing states of Florida and Virginia, one in five black adults is unable to vote because of these laws, according to Holder. In Paul\u2019s home state of Kentucky, it\u2019s also one in five. \u201cSomewhere along the line he gained a lot of knowledge,\u201d Fogle said of Paul\u2019s push to restore voting rights to nonviolent felons. \u201cHe has seen the disenfranchisement,\u201d said Fogle, a community organizer with Kentuckians for the Commonwealth, a nonprofit grassroots organization that has pushed to restore the voting rights of felons. One place where he notices that is west Louisville\u2019s predominantly African-American neighborhoods, a community where Paul sticks out at the grassroots gatherings he\u2019s attended. The potential 2016 presidential candidate has spent quite a bit of time over the past year in that area and at the Plymouth Community Renewal Center listening to black men vent frustration over not being able to vote after completing their prison terms for nonviolent crimes. Paul said he started thinking that this is exactly the type of issue that could help build a bridge between the Republican Party and African-American voters. \u201cIt\u2019s an important issue. When you look at who is being deprived of voting they are disproportionately people of color,\u201d Paul told the state Senate panel. It is a lesson he says was brought home for him in real terms while hanging out in west Louisville. \u201cIn the last six months or so, I\u2019ve been over to the Plymouth Community Center in the west side of Louisville and I met a lot of people there who are very smart, very bright, very articulate who told me they can\u2019t vote because (because they are felons),\u201d Paul said in a phone interview before the hearing. \u201cI\u2019ve become aware of the problem \u2026 not just in regard to voting but also in terms of getting work.\u201d Paul\u2019s push to change laws he says disenfranchise black men\u2014a longtime crusade of many civil rights organizations and minority lawmakers\u2014echoes the slow evolution of the Republican Party following huge losses among African-American voters during the 2012 presidential election. Tough racial issues face GOP in minority outreach An internal autopsy of sorts conducted last year by the Republican National Committee revealed a wide gap between the party and African American voters. The GOP moved to try and fix the rift by beefing up outreach. \u201cWe\u2019ve been improving our messaging because we need to,\u201d said Orlando Watson, the RNC communications director for black media and a former Paul staffer. \u201cBut we need to speak to how our messaging (improves the lives) of all Americans.\u201d As the RNC was working on its messaging problem, potential presidential contenders such as Paul also began tentatively reaching out to minority voters. Paul\u2019s speeches at historically black colleges Howard University in Washington and Simmons College in Louisville, among others have been met with mixed reviews. He was roiled for what some saw as a condescending tone in his questioning whether Howard students knew that the NAACP founders were Republican. But he also received kudos for just showing up. Last year, he was the first major Republican to speak at Howard since Colin Powell in 1994. Efforts like Paul\u2019s illustrate the delicate dance the GOP must undertake if it is to appeal to minority voters in a way that is sincere, said Andra Gillespie, an associate professor of political science at Emory University. \u201cIf the policies are wrong and aren\u2019t framed in a way that is appealing to minorities they are going to be a hard sell to minorities,\u201d she said. Paul may have just struck the right chord. During his lunch last week with Holder, Paul said he talked about their shared concerns about laws that disenfranchise black men, including mandatory minimum sentences for nonviolent crimes. Paul\u2019s also crafting a federal measure that would restore voting rights for felons who committed nonviolent crimes. \u201cWe have to convince people we do care,\u201d Paul said during a phone interview of the GOP\u2019s outreach to minorities. \u201cWe do care about what is going on in areas of long-term poverty and long-term crime.\u201d Currently, 11 states restrict or completely deny voting rights to prisoners even after they\u2019ve completed sentences, probation and parole. In Florida, for example, roughly 10% of the population is banned from voting as a result of these laws. \u201cThere\u2019s a racial outcome in who\u2019s incarcerated in our country,\u201d Paul told the state senators. \u201cNot only is the incarceration unfair but they get out and their voting rights are impaired.\u201d As for Fogle, who got a chance to meet Paul and take a picture with him, she points out that her son registered as a Republican by accident when he voted for the first time. She\u2019s encouraged him to keep the party affiliation. \u201cI told him it didn\u2019t matter,\u201d she said. \u201cAs long as he voted.\u201d A more diverse slate of Republican presidential possibles CNN\u2019s Evan Perez contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Obama administration largely taking a pass on bumper crop of state pot laws State and federal lawmen frustrated by patchwork of pot laws, Obama administration attitude Midterm and 2016 elections could herald a change on nation's marijuana policies Experts say the federal government will eventually have to step in The state-led push to legalize pot is a \u201cchronic\u201d problem for the Obama administration. Marijuana is not only legal in Colorado and Washington, but cannabis has become a cottage industry complete with 420 sampler tours and shops where customers can buy pot brownies or candy in those two states. And New York and Florida could soon join the 20 states and the District of Columbia where medical marijuana is legal, according to the National Conference of State Legislatures. The administration has taken a fuzzy stance on the matter: in states where it\u2019s legal to puff, the government will pass on punishment. \u201cWe\u2019re going to see what happens in the experiments in Colorado and Washington,\u201d President Barack Obama said in a recent interview with CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper. \u201cThe Department of Justice \u2026 has said that we are going to continue to enforce federal laws. But in those states, we recognize that \u2026 the federal government doesn\u2019t have the resources to police whether somebody is smoking a joint on a corner.\u201d Obama's 'schizophrenic policy' on pot? Obama back-tracks on marijuana? W.H.: Don't misinterpret pot comments Fla. to vote on medical marijuana That approach frustrates some in state and federal law enforcement \u2014 including the head of the Drug Enforcement Agency, Michele Leonhart, who according to several media reports, blasted the administration\u2019s approach during an annual sheriffs meeting last month. Jon Gettman, an assistant professor of criminal justice at Shenandoah University, said it is \u201cpolitically convenient\u201d for the administration to allow the states to tackle pot policy rather than change the federal approach. \u201cThey see social change happening and they\u2019re caught between a rock and a hard place,\u201d Gettman said. That social change includes a sea change in the way Americans view pot use. A CNN/ORC International poll last month showed that just over half the country \u2014 55% \u2014supports marijuana legalization. This is up from the 16% who felt that way a quarter century ago. Nearly three-quarters of those polled say alcohol is more dangerous than marijuana. Where pot is legal It\u2019s a sentiment the president shares. \u201cAs has been well documented, I smoked pot as a kid, and I view it as a bad habit and a vice, not very different from the cigarettes that I smoked as a young person up through a big chunk of my adult life,\u201d the President told the New Yorker in a recent interview. \u201cI don\u2019t think it is more dangerous than alcohol.\u201d Shortly after the interview was published, the administration rushed to clarify the President\u2019s position. It said the White House opposes a national move to decriminalize pot despite Obama\u2019s personal views on marijuana use. Marijuana is currently classified under the Controlled Substances Act as \u201cSchedule I,\u201d much like heroin or cocaine, with a high likelihood for abuse and no medical value. \u201cWhat is and isn\u2019t a Schedule I narcotic is a job for Congress,\u201d Obama told Tapper during the CNN interview. However, the President did not say during the interview whether he would urge Congress to move to reclassify marijuana. Rep. Earl Blumenauer, D-Oregon, has been working to gather lawmaker signatures on a letter to Obama in support of reclassifying marijuana. The administration has previously indicated that it is unlikely to reclassify marijuana under a less stringent category of drugs. Frustration with what some lawmakers see as the administration\u2019s mixed messaging on marijuana was evident during a House Government Operations Subcommittee hearing on Tuesday. When Michael Botticelli, deputy director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy, hedged on answering whether cocaine, methamphetamine or marijuana is more dangerous and addictive Blumenauer pounced. \u201cIf a professional like you cannot  answer clearly that meth is more dangerous than marijuana which every kid on the street knows, which every parent knows \u2013 if you can\u2019t answer that maybe that\u2019s why you are failing to educate people about the dangers,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t want kids smoking marijuana. \u2026  But if the deputy director of the office of drug policy can\u2019t answer that question how do you expect high school kids to take you seriously?\u201d Feds working on new pot banking rules Medical marijuana coming to New York? Obama, Perry backpedal on marijuana Should marijuana be legalized? The administration has \u201ca bad political problem\u201d when it comes to pot, said Kevin Sabet, an assistant professor at the University of Florida\u2019s Drug Policy Institute. \u201cI think this is a very difficult position for them and they see it as a lose-lose,\u201d said Sabet, who served as a drug policy adviser to both Republican and Democratic administrations and is on the board of directors of Smart Approaches to Marijuana, an anti-pot legalization group. \u201cThey don\u2019t want to alienate a voting bloc in favor of legalization.\u201d Obama\u2019s views so incensed the DEA director that Leonhart blew off a little steam about the topic during the annual meeting of the country\u2019s sheriffs late last month, according to the Boston Herald. Sheriffs who were present told the paper she expressed frustration over Obama comparing smoking pot to consuming alcohol. \u201cHer comments are not necessarily unexpected,\u201d said Dan Riffle, director of federal policies for the Marijuana Policy Project, a pro pot legalization group. There are a lot of folks who have spent the last 20 to 30 years fighting the war on drugs. It\u2019s natural for them to revolt.\u201d Still, the nation\u2019s attitudes and laws regarding marijuana are changing. During a drug policy debate at the World Economic Forum in Davos, Switzerland, in January, Texas Gov. Rick Perry said he advocated decriminalizing marijuana. But he stopped short of pushing for legalization. However, the stance, coming from a Republican who once ran for President seems to offer further evidence of a change toward views on marijuana even in conservative corners. \u201cAs the governor of the second-largest state in the country, what I can do is start us on policies that can start us on the road towards decriminalization,\u201d Perry said, adding that he views Colorado\u2019s marijuana laws as constitutional but he opposes a federal mandate. The politics of pot even hovered over this year\u2019s so-called \u201cStoner Bowl\u201d as teams from Colorado and Washington faced off in New Jersey, a state where it\u2019s illegal to toke. As Super Bowl traffic curled through the Garden State toward Met Life Stadium, drivers had front row seats to an off-field battle of the billboards by pro and anti-marijuana legalization forces. \u201cMarijuana. Safer than alcohol \u2026 and football,\u201d boasted a billboard by the Marijuana Policy Project. \u201cMarijuana kills your drive. Don\u2019t lose in the game of life,\u201d read the counter by Smart Approaches to Marijuana. Pot and the Super Bowl Mayor: I did not support legalizing pot Piers, Coulter battle over 'potheads' Enforcing the new pot laws in Colorado Eventually though, both marijuana legalization advocates and opponents say, the federal government will have to clear the smoke. \u201cThe real issue is: are we going to have a system where 25 states have legalization and 25 states don\u2019t?\u201d Gettman said, adding, \u201cThings are going to change dramatically after the next two elections in 2014 and 2016 when more states pass this.\u201d The direction of federal pot policy could be determined by upcoming midterms and the 2016 presidential election as states weigh whether to legalize marijuana. There\u2019s big money at stake. Billionaire hedge fund manager George Soros gave $1 million in 2010 to help legalize marijuana in California, a vote which ultimately failed. He and fellow billionaires John Sperling and former Progressive Insurance chairman Peter Lewis, who died late last year, have donated millions to the pot legalization causes in a number of states. \u201cThe long-hair, tie-dye types cut their hair and put on Armani suits and got very serious about pot,\u201d Sabet said adding that opponents worry marijuana could become \u201cthe next big tobacco\u201d with billions of dollars at stake for a product they feel has serious health concerns. A slate of anti-government regulation, pro-states rights, GOP potential presidential candidates such as Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul and Perry will find their positions on marijuana tested by factions within their party that oppose legalization. Rubio opposes legalizing or decriminalizing marijuana for recreational use but recently told the Tampa Bay Times that he is open to learning more about medical marijuana. Last year, during an interview with the Hoover Institution, Paul said he is opposed to legalization but does support decriminalization. One place for common ground might be in efforts to decriminalize the penalties for marijuana-related crimes, opponents and advocates say. The push to decriminalize pot has made for some unlikely partnerships. Obama on the problem of criminalizing marijuana use For example, liberal Democrat Sen. Patrick Leahy of Vermont  teamed up with Paul, a tea party backed conservative on a measure aimed at changing mandatory minimum sentences for some crimes such like marijuana possession. The measure also has the support of Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Illinois, and Republican Sen. Mike Lee of Utah. Tea party backed Republican Rep. Raul Labrador, R-Idaho  and Congressional Black Caucus member Rep. Robert Scott, D-Virginia have joined forces on a similar measure that would judges more wiggle room in sentencing. Obama, civil rights organizations and both pro and anti-marijuana legalization groups all acknowledge that minorities are often disproportionately incarcerated for pot-related crimes. \u201cMy concern is when you end up having very heavy criminal penalties for individual users that have been applied unevenly and in some cases with a racial disparity,\u201d Obama told Tapper during the CNN interview. \u201cI think that is a problem.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Coalition of private groups had asked high court to intervene Justices Alito, Scalia and Thomas opposed the order The issue could affect Wisconsin's race for governor Judge in Texas also strikes down state's voter ID law The U.S. Supreme Court for now has blocked Wisconsin from implementing its voter identification law. After a federal appeals court upheld the law earlier this week, a coalition of private groups had asked the high court to intervene on an emergency basis, complaining the newly-implemented procedures could cause confusion, causing many voters to either not bother to cast a ballot or be mistakenly turned away at the polls. The order issued Thursday evening was opposed by Justices Samuel Alito, Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas. \u201cIt is particularly troubling that absentee ballots have been sent out without any notation that proof of photo identification must be submitted,\u201d said Alito. The state had argued the law reduces voter fraud and promotes accurate record-keeping, saying that producing a government-issued photo identification, such as a driver\u2019s license, would not unduly inconvenience most citizens. Wisconsin officials have not announced their next steps to comply with the high court\u2019s one-page order. The issue could affect the gubernatorial race between incumbent Republican Gov. Scott Walker, who backs voter ID, and his Democratic challenger Mary Burke. The Wisconsin cases are Frank v. Walker (14A376) and (14A352). Meantime in Texas, a judge struck down that state\u2019s voter ID law, saying it would disenfranchise minority voters and therefore could not be implemented. \u201cWe are extremely pleased with today\u2019s ruling, a ruling that was compelled by the facts of this case. Following a two-week trial that included testimony from nearly 40 witnesses, Texas failed to identify a single instance of in-person voter fraud \u2013 the purported justification for Texas\u2019s photo ID law,\u201d said Sherrilyn Ifill, president and director-counsel of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund, the nation\u2019s leading civil rights law firm and a separate entity from the NAACP. \u201cThe Court today effectively ruled that racial discrimination simply cannot spread to the ballot box.\u201d The office of state Attorney General Greg Abbott said in a statement it would appeal \u201cand urge the Fifth Circuit (federal court) to resolve this matter quickly to avoid voter confusion in the upcoming election. The U.S. Supreme Court has already ruled that voter ID laws are constitutional so we are confident the Texas law will be upheld on appeal.\u201d U.S. Attorney General Eric Holder lauded both the Wisconsin and Texas decisions. \u201cThis Department will never yield in its commitment to protecting that most sacred of Americans\u2019 rights \u2013 the right to vote,\u201d he said in a statement.",

            "article_content": "Imperial Wizard denounces recent slayings at Jewish institutions, says new Klan not about violence Historians, marketing experts say there's nearly no chance the KKK could rebrand A week ago, a white supremacist shot and killed three at Jewish-affiliated facilities in Kansas Pointy hats, white robes, crosses burning, bodies hanging from trees. The images of the Ku Klux Klan are reminders of the nation\u2019s ugliest moments from the Civil War through the struggle for racial equality in the 1960s. Last Sunday, the world was confronted with another image of the Klan: 73-year-old Frazier Glenn Cross, a white supremacist and avowed anti-Semite, in the back of a police car, spitting, \u201cHeil Hitler!\u201d When his alleged rampage at two Jewish institutions in suburban Kansas City, Kansas, was over, three people were shot dead \u2013 a teenage boy and his grandfather along with a woman who worked with visually impaired children. The carnage was devastating to many. Imperial Wizard Frank Ancona was upset, too. \u201cWhat this guy just did set back everything I\u2019ve been trying to do for years,\u201d said Ancona, who leads the Traditionalist American Knights of the Ku Klux Klan. CNN tracked Ancona down on Twitter, where he has 840 followers, after he and other self-professed hate group leaders denounced the shootings in interviews with USA Today and CNN affiliate WDAF in Kansas City, Missouri. \u201cI believe in racial separation but it doesn\u2019t have to be violent,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cPeople in the Klan are professional people, business people, working types. We are a legitimate organization.\u201d Cross, who founded the Carolina Knights of the KKK in the 1980s, went \u201crogue,\u201d Ancona said. Charged with capital murder and first-degree premeditated murder, Cross did not enter a plea at his first court appearance. He requested a court appointed attorney and is scheduled to be back in court later this month. New way for the KKK? 2012: KKK sues to 'Adopt-a-Highway' Ancona, who lives in Missouri, insists there\u2019s a new Klan for modern times \u2013 a Klan that\u2019s \u201cabout educating people to our ideas and getting people to see our point of view to \u2026 help change things.\u201d He said he and those like him can spread that message without violence \u2013 a sort of rebranding of the Klan. The idea may sound absurd, but is it conceivable? No, say top marketing experts, brand gurus and historians \u2013 and for many reasons. The Klan could change its name, get a smooth-talking spokesperson, replace the robes with suits and take off those ridiculous hats, but underneath, people would recognize its message is the same. \u201cThey stand for hatred; they always have,\u201d said Atlanta-based brand consultant Laura Ries. \u201cMaybe they don\u2019t believe in shooting up a center for Jewish people, but they still support beliefs that are beyond the scope of understanding for most people and certainly the freedom and equality our country believes in.\u201d Other experts raised the question: If the Klan isn\u2019t violent, what\u2019s the point? \u201cWhat would you be left with? Benign racism?\u201d asked Jelani Cobb, director of the Africana Studies Institute at the University of Connecticut. The victims of the shooting rampage, Cobb noted, were not Jewish. One was Catholic and two were Methodist. \u201cIn the most basic sense, the fact that the people who were killed were not Jews drives home Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.\u2019s point that injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s the most horrible metaphor for the fact that we are all impacted by the legacy of hate, even when it\u2019s not specifically directed at the group to which we belong.\u201d Even if the modern KKK at large distances itself from this supposedly \u201crogue\u201d element, Cobb said, that doesn\u2019t make up for the group\u2019s past. \u201cViolence and racial intimidation were the KKK\u2019s raison d\u2019etre. They\u2019re not simply a controversial civic organization. If in fact they reject violence, the only honest way of establishing that would be to do restorative work for the incredible damage their history of violence has already done,\u201d he said. \u201cNo sensible person is going to wait around for that to happen.\u201d Disorganized discrimination From a sheer marketing perspective, the lack of central leadership poses more problems for the KKK if it\u2019s serious about revamping its image. Just look at the Catholic Church, Ries said. \u201cThe KKK doesn\u2019t have a Pope. Look at what that guy has done. You have to have a leader like that to make people believe a change has happened,\u201d she said. Without a clear leader, marketing experts said, crafting and conveying a spin-friendly message is impossible. That was evident the minute members of the \u201cnew\u201d Klan denounced the shootings. Soon after Ancona spoke to reporters, other self-described \u201creal\u201d Klansmen began attacking him online for not adhering to authentic Klan doctrine. \u201cThis movement is a hodgepodge of little groups that, as often as they attack their enemies, attack one another,\u201d said Mark Potok, a spokesman for the Southern Poverty Law Center, which monitors hate groups. He estimates there are about 8,000 KKK members nationwide. \u201cTo call these guys disorganized,\u201d he said, \u201cdoesn\u2019t quite do it.\u201d Potok pointed to a 2013 rally in Memphis, Tennessee, that drew about 75 Klan members. They arrived in their typical get-up to protest the city\u2019s move to rename three city parks that honored Confederate leaders. Then it got confusing and weird. Another group of Klansmen showed up to protest the first Klan group, according to Potok and a local media report. The second Klan group claimed to be about nonviolence and actually teamed with a black Crips street gang. The second group of Klansmen wanted people to know they were the real deal, the ones everyone should listen to, Potok recounted. Bullhorns apparently belonging to the first KKK group died shortly after their gathering began. Memphis\u2019 Commercial Appeal reported that their chants of \u201cwhite power\u201d were barely audible over the approximately 1,000 folks who showed up to protest racial intolerance. A Klansman with a Twitter account Potok doesn\u2019t put much weight in the Klan\u2019s condemnation of the Jewish center shootings, because it\u2019s not the first time hate groups have done that. They did it after the 1995 Oklahoma City bombing orchestrated by militia sympathizer Timothy McVeigh and after a white supremacist killed six people at a Sikh temple in Wisconsin in 2012, he said. \u201cThere\u2019s a method to doing that. By publicly saying, \u2018Oh, not us; we don\u2019t do that,\u2019 they think they\u2019re protecting themselves against law enforcement zeroing in on them or from us suing them,\u201d Potok said. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t work, but they believe that.\u201d In the early 1980s, Morris Dees, SPLC\u2019s co-founder and chief trial counsel, began using courts to secure monetary damages against hate groups. Courts then seized the groups\u2019 assets. By 1991, many had gone into bankruptcy. In 1981, Dees successfully sued the KKK and won a $7 million judgment for the mother of Michael Donald, a black lynching victim in Alabama. The judgment bankrupted the United Klans of America, which had to sell its national headquarters to help pay it off. In the early 1980s, while operating the Carolina Knights of the Ku Klux Klan, Cross eschewed white robes for fatigues and recruited active-duty soldiers as members. According to the Anti-Defamation League, which released a summary of its files on Cross this week, the group \u201cdrew notoriety for its paramilitary training exercises\u201d and carried out attacks on African-Americans. The SPLC sued Cross for operating an illegal paramilitary organization and for intimidating African-Americans. The two sides settled, with the Knights barred from operating. But a month later, Cross resurfaced with an offshoot: the White Patriot Party. Ancona, the imperial wizard, is aware of that history and said he thought it might be helpful if he and Potok had a conversation. Throughout CNN\u2019s interview, Ancona was cordial and repeatedly said he wanted to speak with media about the Klan\u2019s message. He won\u2019t be able to divulge too many operational details of his group, he said, because fraternal rites and rituals bar him from discussing exactly what they do. Ancona explained that he\u2019s in his second four-year term as imperial wizard, elected by state Klan group\u2019s leaders, known as grand dragons. To get their message out, the Traditionalist Knights of the KKK wear their usual attire and stand on roadsides handing out flyers. They also have a Web page, and they use Twitter and occasionally LinkedIn, where Ancona promotes \u201cworking together as a team and a unit\u201d to \u201cstrive to increase awareness of the destruction of our constitutional rights and the plight of the White race in America.\u201d \u201cFacebook keeps deleting my posts,\u201d he said. Ancona\u2019s branch of the KKK has a toll-free hotline that asks callers to press 1 if they would like an information packet, 2 for media inquiries, or 3 to talk to a member of the organization. An outgoing voice mail explains the group is \u201cunapologetically committed to the interests and values of the white race. We are determined to maintain and enrich our cultural and racial heritage. White people will simply not buy the equality propaganda anymore and have begun to doubt some of the anti-Klan hysteria that they have been fed in school and from TV and movies.\u201d Rhetoric and reaction Dan Hill, a marketing expert who specializes in how consumers react emotionally to advertisements, said there can probably never be a Klan rebranding. \u201cDisney is happiness. Nike is you\u2019re proud you ran the race. The Ayran Brotherhood \u2013 that\u2019s somewhere on the spectrum of rage and outrage,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are talking about an emotion that leads to violence. If you use that rhetoric, you can\u2019t say you didn\u2019t expect that kind of reaction.\u201d That\u2019s a lesson history keeps trying to teach. \u201cThe Klan has always been about wolves in sheep\u2019s clothing,\u201d said John Rowley, president of advertising agency and crisis management firm Fletcher Rowley in Nashville. \u201cHate groups have never had on their business cards the n-word or some sort of overt act of violence. They\u2019ve always tried to appear a little more inclusive and less threatening, so it\u2019s not surprising that they\u2019re saying they are against this shooting.\u201d Rowley\u2019s firm has worked on more than 500 political campaigns for Democrats in 46 states, including the 1991 election of Edwin Edwards for governor of Louisiana. The election made national headlines because Edwin\u2019s opponent, former KKK leader David Duke, made an unexpectedly strong showing. \u201cDuke was a master of rhetoric to seem like a well-mannered candidate on the outside when he was a zealot on the inside,\u201d said Rowley. There were several factors that contributed to Duke\u2019s loss, but when it comes to groups like the KKK, Rowley said, speaking as an ad man, even the \u201cbest spin must be grounded in reality.\u201d \u201cTheir core mission violates American core values right now,\u201d he said. \u201cWe don\u2019t believe in discrimination. You can\u2019t just put a nice wrapper on that with the right words and a rebranding campaign. Or to compare it to a product, \u201cif you have a car that is killing people because the gas tank is exploding, it doesn\u2019t matter how fantastic the ad campaign is for that car.\u201d Read: The accused Kansas killer\u2019s neo-pagan religion Read: Suspect \u2018entrenched in the hate movement\u2019 CNN\u2019s Phil Gast contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Dave Brubeck's meaning was bigger than his music Iconic jazz pianist seared by childhood meeting His music says more about the future than past Brubeck: \"It had an impact on me I'll never forget\" Dave Brubeck was taking a horse ride with his father one day when he saw something that would haunt him for the rest of his life. He was along on a cattle-buying trip with his father, Pete, a rancher in Northern California. Pete Brubeck asked an African-American cowboy who everyone called \u201cShine\u201d to come over and greet his son. Pete Brubeck then asked Shine to open his shirt. Brubeck, then only 6, watched as Shine unbuttoned his shirt to reveal a brand on his chest: He had been marked like cattle. Shine was the first black person Brubeck had ever seen. A furious Pete Brubeck told his son that \u201csomething like this never should happen again.\u201d \u201cIt had an impact on me I\u2019ll never forget,\u201d Brubeck told journalist Hedrick Smith for a documentary called \u201cRediscovering Dave Brubeck.\u201d \u201cI thought, \u2018What can I do about this?\u2019 It\u2019s like my dad (was) telling me to do something about it.\u201d Brubeck, the pioneering jazz pianist who died this month at 91, did more to help people like Shine than most people realize. The tributes that poured in after his death tended to focus on the same themes: He was the jazz legend whose \u201cDave Brubeck Quartet\u201d gave the world the jazz standard \u201cTake Five,\u201d he stretched the boundaries of jazz and was a champion for civil rights. Brubeck, though, was bigger than all of that. His life and music say more about this country\u2019s future than its past. He and an entire generation of white, black and Latino jazz musicians helped create one of the nation\u2019s first multicultural communities. They offered a snapshot of what this nation is becoming, like it or not. To make that world possible, Brubeck and other white jazz musicians did something remarkable. They joined a jazz community where white men were the minority \u2013 and whiteness was seen as a liability, not the norm. How did Brubeck do it, and how did he thrive? Delve into his interviews and his music, and the clues emerge. Seeing genius in a \u2018servant\u2019 He listened to the story of \u201cthe other.\u201d Many fans know this story. Brubeck\u2019s breakout year came in 1954. He was touring with Duke Ellington, one of America\u2019s greatest composers and a jazz titan. It had an impact on me I\u2019ll never forget. Dave Brubeck, jazz pianist, on pivotal childhood meeting One day, Brubeck heard a knock on his hotel door. He opened it to find Ellington, smiling and holding several copies of Time magazine. Brubeck was on the cover. His heart sank. Ellington was his friend. He knew that Time had also been interviewing Ellington, and Brubeck thought the jazz composer deserved the honor over him. \u201cI wanted to be on the cover after Duke,\u201d Brubeck told the narrator in Ken Burns\u2019 epic documentary on jazz. \u201cThe worst thing that could have happened to me was that I was there before Duke, and he was delivering the news to me.\u201d Photos: Notable people we've lost in 2012 The black experience was initially foreign to Brubeck. He was born in Northern California and grew up on a cattle ranch near the Sierra Mountains. But even as his fame eclipsed many of his black musical mentors, he continually talked about the musical debt he owed to them. The virtuosity of black artists like Ellington, Louis Armstrong and Ella Fitzgerald sometimes did what a civil rights march or a court decision couldn\u2019t do \u2013 force whites like Brubeck to see the humanity of black people. One of the most famous jazz conversion stories comes from Ken Burns\u2019  \u201cJazz\u201d documentary. In 1931, Charles Black was a white teenager who decided to go hear Armstrong play in an Austin, Texas, hotel. He knew nothing about jazz, but something shifted in him as he watched a rapturous Armstrong perform. \u201cHe was the first genius I\u2019d ever seen,\u201d Black recalled. \u201cIt is impossible to underestimate the significance of a 16-year-old southern boy seeing genius for the first time in a black person. We literally never saw a black man in anything but a servant\u2019s capacity. \u201cLouis opened my eyes wide and put to me a choice: Blacks, the saying went, were \u2018all right in their place,\u2019 but what was the place of such a man, and of the people from which he sprung?\u201d Black would go on to join a team of lawyers that successfully convinced the U.S. Supreme Court to overturn the segregation of students based on race in the 1954 Brown vs. Board of Education decision. Brubeck: Jazz master with big heart An \u2018instinct for differences\u2019 Brubeck was inspired by differences. He didn\u2019t look like a jazz musician. When he led the quartet, he looked like a chemistry professor who accidentally found himself behind the piano. With his black horn-rimmed glasses, goofy grin and his square suits, the affable Brubeck looked like Mr. Normal. Yet Brubeck was a wild man behind the keyboard. He was like a musical mad scientist \u2013 combining unconventional time signatures and musical styles from other cultures that wouldn\u2019t appear to work but did. He sought out the same combustible mix in his famous quartet. Many jazz leaders surrounded themselves with musicians who they had an almost telepathic rapport with onstage. But Brubeck\u2019s Quartet clashed. Brubeck was known for pounding the piano with thunderous chords. His saxophonist, Paul Desmond, played with a light and lyrical style that was so exquisite that one critic said he left \u201ca trail of honey in the air.\u201d And then there was his drummer, Joe Morello, a proud man with superb technique who wanted to be showcased more. The group fought musically and personally. Morello clashed with Desmond. Desmond clashed with Brubeck. They were all so different, but Brubeck made it work. He wasn\u2019t threatened by differences.  They inspired him, said Ted Giola, a jazz historian and author. \u201cIt\u2019s to Dave Brubeck\u2019s credit that he was able to hear these musicians that played very differently from him and was able to see that by taking them and getting their different sounds, he was adding, not subtracting,\u201d Giola said in the documentary \u201cRediscovering  Dave Brubeck.\u201d \u201cDave had an instinct for differences and how that was going to add to his music.\u201d Jazz and democracy It must be said, though, that the jazz world that Brubeck helped create wasn\u2019t a racial utopia. Black artists were exploited. White audiences gravitated to some white jazz artists who didn\u2019t have the talent of black artists. Even some white artists like Brubeck were looked at with disdain by some black musicians. Ian Carey, a jazz trumpeter who recently wrote an essay, \u201cHow Not to Become a Bitter White Jazz musician,\u201d said \u201cwhite musicians unfairly profited from discrimination against black musicians by audiences and the music industry.\u201d Yet Carey also said that when it came time to play, a lot of those divisions evaporated because of something inherent in jazz: Most jazz musicians don\u2019t care how you look. They just care about how you play. \u201cThe bandstand is a great equalizer,\u201d he said. \u201cYou\u2019re going to get the best guy or woman for the gig. It doesn\u2019t matter what they look like.\u201d Brubeck applied the same principle to his music. He led the first integrated band in the U.S. Army during World War II. He hired a black man, Eugene Wright, to be his quartet\u2019s bassist. The jazz world that Brubeck moved in was full of cross-racial and cross-cultural fertilizations. They weren\u2019t just ahead of their time; in some respects, they were ahead of our time. Some of the biggest jazz records came from artists who built friendships across racial and ethnic lines. The singer Frank Sinatra recorded with and relentlessly championed black artists like Fitzgerald and Count Basie. The white saxophonist Stan Getz kicked off the bossa nova craze with his recordings with Brazilians Astrud and Joao Gilberto. The jazz album classic \u201cKind of Blue\u201d was spawned by the relationship between Bill Evans, a white, mild-mannered pianist who looked like a tax accountant, and the pugnacious black trumpeter Miles Davis. Jazz lore says that initially some of the black members of Davis\u2019 band didn\u2019t want Evans to join  the group because he was white, but Davis insisted because he loved Evans\u2019 \u201cquiet fire.\u201d \u201cKind of Blue\u201d went on to become the best-selling jazz album of all time. \u201cHe was a guy who looked like a stereotypical white nerd,\u201d Carey says of Evans. \u201cBut he could play. \u2026 What he played was so much bigger than his appearance.\u201d This egalitarian tradition in jazz \u2013 everyone is equal on the bandstand \u2013 has led some to compare it to democracy. The jazz trumpeter Wynton Marsalis once said that nothing captures the democratic process as perfectly as jazz. \u201cJazz means working things out musically with other people. You have to listen to other musicians and play with them even if you don\u2019t agree with what they\u2019re playing. It teaches you the very opposite of racism and anti-Semitism. It teaches you that the world is big enough to accommodate us all.\u201d Brubeck was a champion for democracy as well as jazz. It\u2019s often forgotten that many of the exotic rhythms he infused into his music came from tours his quartet took of the Middle and Far East. The State Department sponsored these tours to promote democracy during the Cold War. Brubeck often compared jazz to democracy, saying both challenged individuals to express their freedom while being disciplined enough to respect the freedom of others. Brubeck\u2019s words about jazz and democracy take on even more meaning with the recent presidential election. It was a bruising election season and it revealed that the nation is experiencing profound demographic and social changes. Attitudes toward gay marriage are shifting, a black president was re-elected to a second term, and the U.S. Census Bureau predicts that the country will have a majority-minority population by 2043. Perhaps some Americans feel like traditional jazz purists felt after they first heard Brubeck\u2019s exotic rhythms on his groundbreaking 1959 \u201cTime Out\u201d album: My world is changing, and I don\u2019t know these tunes. David Simon, the creator of the HBO series, \u201cThe Wire,\u201d captured some of that angst in an essay he wrote right after the election entitled \u201cBarack Obama and The Death of Normal.\u201d \u201cAmerica will soon belong to the men and women \u2013 white and black and Latino and Asian, Christian and Jew and Muslim and atheist, gay and straight \u2013 who can walk into a room and accept with real comfort the sensation that they are in a world of certain difference, that there are no real majorities, only pluralities and coalitions.\u201d \u201cWe are all the \u2018other\u2019 now,\u201d he wrote. Brubeck entered that world over half-a-century ago. He was a white man in a world dominated by black artists, but he wasn\u2019t threatened by the differences. He respected tradition but he wasn\u2019t afraid to subvert it if it meant growth. He learned how to listen to, and be inspired by the music of \u201cthe other.\u201d Brubeck was often called the \u201cAmbassador of the Cool,\u201d but he was more. He was the ambassador for a new America.",

            "article_content": "Bundy Ranch supporters say the federal government is trampling on its rights But not all ranchers in Nevada support rancher Cliven Bundy The use of public lands out West is critical to people's livelihood When the Bureau of Land Management retreated from a standoff with Cliven Bundy, a few hundred people traveled to his Nevada ranch to protest what they see as an overreach of the federal government. One protester from neighboring Utah, Stephen L. Dean, 45, called the Bureau of Land Management\u2019s actions \u201ctyranny in government.\u201d And a banner at the protest site blared: \u201cHas the West been won? Or has the fight just begun!\u201d Showdown on the range The Bundy standoff is emblematic of the larger anti-government sentiment around the country that has been amplified with the creation of the tea party movement in 2009. But the latest move in a two-decade-long tug of war between Bundy and the federal government is bringing to light the delicate balance that has lasted between citizens in the West and the federal government over the use of federally owned land for generations. Reid: Ranchers \"domestic terrorists\" Tensions escalate: Rancher defies feds Feds and cattle ranchers face off Private rancher on public lands? Bundy tends his 900 cattle grazing on taxpayer-owned land about 100 miles north of Las Vegas. To an East Coast dweller, the concept of public lands can be a foreign one, as people own or rent their plot of space in urban, suburban and commuter towns that crowd the Eastern Seaboard. But out West, public lands are a big deal. Almost everyone uses them or depends on them. They are key to people\u2019s recreational hiking, fishing, hunting and skiing. And they are critical to people\u2019s livelihood, as they are used to cut timber, drill oil, mine coal and ranch cattle. Vast swaths of the land in the West are predominately public. In Nevada, for example, 87% of the state is owned by the federal government, and the BLM oversees 245 million acres of public lands mostly west of the Mississippi River, not including the lands overseen by the National Forest Service and half a dozen other federal agencies. \u201cPublic lands are true assets of the U.S.,\u201d said Bob Abbey, former director of the Bureau of Land Management. Reid calls Bundy, supporters \u2018domestic terrorists\u2019 How did Bundy ever get use of federal lands? In Nevada, ranchers depend on the federal lands for their livelihood. The government began allowing the use of the land in 1877 to promote the economic development of dry, difficult-to-cultivate desert areas. So it offered land for dirt cheap. Bundy says his family has owned the ranch since about the time the Desert Land Act passed. A version of the law still exists today, allowing ranchers to graze their cattle on public lands for a nominal rate. The fee is cheaper than what the rancher would pay the state or a private land owner, but the tradeoff is that the rancher has to share the land with the public. Feds end roundup, release cattle after showdown The history This is not the first standoff between public land users and the government. The most famous one, the Sagebrush Rebellion in the 1970s, pitted ranchers, loggers and miners against the federal government. They thought the Jimmy Carter administration was too heavy-handed in its regulatory and environmental policies. Former Nevada state Sen. Dean Rhoads, who is also a rancher, led the negotiations with the federal government, which he said were peaceful and productive. Ronald Reagan, Carter\u2019s opponent in the 1980 presidential election, sided with the Sagebrush rebels, saying, \u201cThe next administration won\u2019t treat the West as if it were not worthy of attention. The next administration will reflect the values and goals of the Sagebrush Rebellion. Indeed, we can turn the Sagebrush Rebellion into the Sagebrush Solution.\u201d Reagan was a former governor of California, where the federal government owns roughly half the state\u2019s land Since then, the BLM and the corresponding state agency have confiscated cattle from violators, but nothing escalated to the temperature of the Bundy Ranch situation. The Bureau of Land Management The BLM is a federal agency that operates predominantly in the West and is in charge of managing these lands. It must balance the desires of ranchers, environmentalists, recreationalists, and industrialists. \u201cI think a lot of people who live in the East don\u2019t understand the BLM,\u201d said Abbey, the former director. Jon Griggs is manager of the 200,000-acre Maggie Creek Ranch in Elko, Nevada, a third of which uses public lands. He says he\u2019s sympathetic to the BLM, citing its difficult job. \u201cA lot of times they don\u2019t make anybody happy,\u201d he said, because the bureau is responsible for managing lands for so many uses. \u201cI think that folks on the ground at BLM are good folks trying to do the best they can.\u201d But this system unique to the United States brings conflict. The environmentalists The balance between conservation and public use is a major source of tension when overseeing government land. The desert tortoise is a factor in the Bundy equation, and the rancher was ordered to remove his cattle from public lands in 1993 after the tortoise was placed on the protected species list. Bundy refused to comply, and he racked up more than $1 million in fines. Brian O\u2019Donnell, executive director at the Conservation Lands Foundation, called Bundy \u201cone of the most selfish and irresponsible users of public land that I\u2019ve ever witnessed.\u201d \u201cThe key tenet in public lands in America is they belong to all of us,\u201d he said. When one person puts his \u201cown selfish interest above everyone else\u2019s, the whole system falls apart.\u201d Ranchers\u2019 sentiment The Bundy situation is a common topic of conversation in rural Nevada, a part of the country filled with libertarian sentiment distrustful of the government, Griggs said. And like his, he said people\u2019s feelings are mixed. While the ranch manager is sympathetic to the BLM\u2019s mission, he said its tactics were the wrong approach. Griggs said he understands where Bundy is coming from, saying the BLM \u201cput his back up against the wall.\u201d But Griggs also said that Bundy lost all efforts at appeal and that now he should follow the law. \u201cI think it\u2019s a mess any way you slice it,\u201d he said. \u2018Welfare ranchers\u2019 Because of the cheap rent, some, including fellow cattlemen who don\u2019t ranch on public lands, call public land ranchers \u201cwelfare ranchers\u201d and have no sympathy for the Western lot. But Griggs said they don\u2019t understand that ranching public land is \u201cnot a bargain.\u201d \u201cOn public lands, you might get kicked off at any moment for a turtle. That\u2019s kind of the deal,\u201d he said. Rhoads, the former Nevada state senator, said 600 ranchers are currently paying their fees to the federal government for use of the land. He says that because of Bundy, people will \u201cthink that us in Nevada are getting away with not paying the government what it owes them.\u201d The politics Unsurprisingly, Bundy has become a political symbol. Senate Majority Harry Reid, D-Nevada, called him a \u201cdomestic terrorist.\u201d \u201cThese people who hold themselves out to be patriots are not,\u201d he said in Las Vegas. Democratic Rep. Dina Titus told journalist John Ralston that Bundy is \u201cnot a folk hero,\u201d Ralston tweeted, but said Reid shouldn\u2019t call him a terrorist. But libertarian-minded Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky criticized the federal government\u2019s response, saying it \u201cshouldn\u2019t violate the law, nor should we have 48 federal agencies carrying weapons and having SWAT teams.\u201d \u201cCan everybody decide what the law is on their own? No, there has to be a legal process,\u201d he said on WHAS radio in Louisville. \u201cBut I think there is definitely a philosophic debate over who should own the land.\u201d The future The BLM might have lost the latest battle with Bundy, but it has other tools at its disposal, including arresting Bundy for failing to follow the law, seizing his assets through the Treasury Department or sending the case to the Department of Justice. The agency has not yet said what its next course of action will be, but former BLM director Abbey said that it must prevail because of the precedent it would set. If Bundy gets away with illegally grazing on lands and not paying fines, it could encourage other ranchers to follow suit. While Bundy is a source of contention, ranchers out West are watching the BLM\u2019s next steps in the Bundy standoff, and they are worried about the BLM\u2019s next major action: Conservationists are asking for protection for the sage grouse. The Nevada Cattlemen\u2019s Association says the BLM\u2019s draft proposal includes \u201coverly burdensome grazing requirements.\u201d It would also reduce the number of grazing permits.",
