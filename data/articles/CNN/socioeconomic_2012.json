            "article_content": "By John Kuhn, Special to CNN Editor\u2019s note: John Kuhn is superintendent of Perrin-Whitt Consolidated Independent School District, the same rural Texas school district he attended as a student from kindergarten through 12th grade. (CNN) \u2013 In an election year where the question of our nation\u2019s fiscal future is front and center, we cannot forget that the educational progress of our children is pivotal for renewing U.S. prosperity. Yet more than 10 years after its enactment, there is scant evidence that the Bush-era No Child Left Behind federal law has lived up to its promise to provide a better quality education for students being left behind in public schools. Indeed, we are witnessing its failures in real time, and millions of our neediest children stand in the dust of No Child Left Behind. While NCLB has made blaming and shaming local schools and individual middle-class educators the centerpiece of education policy, Texas schools are funded through a system, the Target Revenue System, in which each school district is assigned a dollar amount per student that varies according to property wealth. Areas blessed with high property values or mineral wealth automatically have more money pumped into their school systems, which translates directly into newer computers, better books and more qualified teachers for their children. So while each district is required to offer the same mandated programs and have its students achieve an identical minimum in terms of test scores, attendance rates and graduation rates, the schools in wealthier communities receive more resources with which to achieve the same results. Our kids all run the same race; it\u2019s just that some of them get to wear Nikes, and some get flip flops. Good luck kids. The bottom line is that Texas is investing millions more to educate children in rich neighborhoods than it is spending to educate the same number of kids in our poor neighborhoods. And if the kids in the poor zip codes fail to achieve high test scores, the federal government reserves blame for their teachers and their school boards, not for the architects of the great brain robbery being perpetrated against children born in the wrong neighborhoods. This goes on nationwide. In the absence of a new federal education framework authorized by Congress, the Obama administration is granting waivers that will let states off the hook for some key equity measures meant to improve outcomes for struggling students, schools and districts. Although these specific waiver requirements may be new, the direction of the reforms they embrace isn\u2019t much different from NCLB: Measuring outcomes without requiring the appropriate inputs, labeling schools and teachers without appropriate measurements or supports and emphasizing testing in narrow subject areas instead of encouraging a well-rounded and balanced education. Again under the waivers, there is plenty of blame to go around, but none for politicians who through their funding shenanigans cynically rob opportunity from the very same children who end up failing their tests in startling numbers. This approach continues to ignore the mounting evidence that reform focused exclusively on outcomes actually widens the achievement gap. It also amounts to a refusal to fix the growing inequities in educational funding that exacerbate student underachievement and pose the biggest roadblock to teacher effectiveness. This leaves our teachers \u2013 who are being asked to do more with less everyday \u2013 continuously on trial under NCLB. Meanwhile, our lawmakers escape scrutiny for not passing policies that will help alleviate these inequities and remediate other out-of-school factors, such as poverty, homelessness and lack of adequate health care \u2013 all of which have conclusively devastating effects on student test scores. We are merely treating the fever we see and ignoring the cancer that causes it. Perhaps in an effort to address these shortcomings, the administration\u2019s fiscal year 2013 budget significantly boosts educational investments, including a request for up to $30 billion to prevent teacher layoffs and address teacher quality and another $30 billion to improve school facilities. However, while these recommended investments are much needed, they are offset by the expansion of competitive grant programs that direct substantial sums away from more inclusive formula-funded programs and toward the few states and organizations that meet specific, but often experimental, requirements \u2014 requirements all too often supported by \u201cresearch\u201d that comes straight from ideology-driven think tanks. There is no doubt that the stakes are high. Our nation is in the middle of a great demographic shift. Children of color younger than 18 will become a majority of all children in the United States by the end of the decade. These young people largely come from lower-income households in neighborhoods with struggling schools. If we fail to implement the right policy framework that supports achievement for all students, strengthens the teaching profession and strikes the right balance between opportunity and accountability, the United States will find itself falling even further behind in the global economy. In the end, although salesmen of countless nouveau \u201cmiracle\u201d programs will say otherwise, our success or failure in education isn\u2019t the exclusive property of teachers. If anything, many thousands of brave teachers nationwide are trying to undo the harms perpetrated by politicians \u2013 both in Texas and in our nation\u2019s capitol \u2013 who use budget shortfalls as an excuse to ignore the needs of the most vulnerable (and most under-represented) in our society. We have seen fit to quietly give educational scraps to other people\u2019s children for too long, and now that we see the inescapable results, we would rather tear down the schools than offend the merchants of inequity who inhabit our voting booths \u2014 ourselves. We owe it to ourselves to get education reform right. The 2020 Vision Roadmap: A Pre-K Through Postsecondary Blueprint for Educational Success from the Opportunity to Learn campaign provides a comprehensive reform approach that includes many evidence-informed strategies that give all students a real opportunity to learn. Policymakers, education professionals, parents and other stakeholders should use it to guide the policies and practices they must advance to support our children\u2019s dreams and restore our nation\u2019s prosperity. Or, we can just keep doing more of the same. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of John Kuhn.",

            "article_content": "President Barack Obama and GOP nominee Mitt Romney both have gender pay hits and misses Both candidates brag about their records on hiring and paying women in debate and on the trail Both candidates have failed to fully close the pay equity gap Both candidates increased hiring of women to highly placed positions President Barack Obama and his opponent former Massachusetts Gov. Mitt Romney have touted their records of hiring women while in office\u2014but both candidates have a mixed record on equal hiring and closing the gender pay gap. Under the Obama administration, the median salary for female federal employees is nearly 93% of what men make, according to the U.S. Merit Systems Protection Board, an agency that works to protect the rights of federal employees. That figure \u2013 while up from just over 83% in 1991 \u2013 does not represent complete pay parity. The Obama White House had women holding just under 40% of jobs paying $75,000 or more in 2011. According to a University of Massachusetts Center for Women in Politics and Public Policy study, when Romney was sworn in as governor in 2003, 42% of his administration\u2019s senior-level appointments were women. That figure dropped to 25% during the last two years of his tenure. Opinion: Does Romney \u2018get\u2019 women who work? The political gender wars erupted anew during Tuesday night\u2019s presidential debate when each candidate accused the other of not doing enough to help women. Some of the most heated exchanges between the candidates in their second debate were over so-called \u201cwomen\u2019s issues.\u201d Obama pointed to the fact that the first bill he signed as president, the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act, eases the way for women to sue if they aren\u2019t being paid equitably. A look at Wisconsin female swing voters Reporter: Romney wasn't behind 'binders' Abortion and the war for women's votes Romney's changing position on abortion Healey: Dems distracting from issues \u201cSo we fixed that,\u201d Mr. Obama said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s an example of the kind of advocacy that we need because women are increasingly the breadwinners in the family.\u201d Romney had not stated a public position on Lilly Ledbetter before Tuesday\u2019s debate when he said he would not seek to repeal it. His running mate, Rep. Paul Ryan, voted against the bill. \u2018Binders,\u2019 cooking and equal pay: Did Romney undo gains with women voters? Romney attempted to appeal to women\u2019s pocketbooks saying that women have been especially hard hit by the economic downturn \u2014 a problem he said he would solve if elected president. \u201cThere are three and a half million more women living in poverty today than when the president took office,\u201d Romney said. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to live like this. We can get this economy going again.\u201d Ryan focused on how women fared under the Obama administration at a campaign rally in central Florida Thursday. \u201cOver 5 million women have just left the work force. Fewer women are working today than when he took office. And so of the people who have been hit the hardest, it\u2019s women.\u201d Women are back on the job \u201c[W]e\u2019ve got to champion small businesses which are the kinds of companies that have flexible job schedules that women can get easily back in to the work force,\u201d continued Ryan. \u201cAnd of all the things we can do to get women back into the workforce, get them the skills they need, get an economy, and help those small businesses bring them back into the work force so they can provide for themselves and their families.\u201d Nationally, women earn 77 cents for every dollar earned by men, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics. Behind the war of words is the reality that both candidates must make significant inroads with female voters \u2014 a group that makes up the majority of the electorate\u2014in order to win the election. POLL: What are the most important women\u2019s issues? The candidates are statistically even among women voters in swing states, according to a new USA TODAY/Gallup Poll with Obama at 49% and Romney at 48%. These numbers track with similar polling data following Romney\u2019s strong performance in the first presidential debate. \u201cThe race among women was much tighter in swing states,\u201d said Andra Gillespie, an associate professor of political science at Emory University in Atlanta. \u201cFrom now on, I would expect that President Obama will tout his record on pay equity and support for contraception to shore up support among women. Still, I would expect that Obama\u2019s performance will be stronger among single than married women. The question will be whether he can get single women to turn out in high rates this time around.\u201d POLL: In swing states, likely women voters are split Both candidates have used their records of hiring women to illustrate to potential voters that they understand women\u2019s issues. The White House points to highly placed women in the administration as an example of what it sees as its strong record of gender equality. Those positions include Supreme Court Justices Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan as well as Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano, Health Secretary Kathleen Sebelius, Labor Secretary Hilda Solis and U.N. Ambassador Susan Rice. The White House also says that more than half of the staff is made up of women, who fulfill key senior leadership roles. Romney, who worked in business before serving as governor of Massachusetts, said he \u201clearned a great deal\u201d about the inequalities between men and women in the workplace when leading his state. The highest-ranking woman in his administration was Lt. Gov. Kerry Healey. Beth Myers has long held senior positions in Romney\u2019s political campaign. CNN Fact Check: Candidates positions on contraception? When he and his staff ran into problems finding qualified female applicants to fill Cabinet posts, Romney said he \u201cwent to a number of women\u2019s groups and said, \u2018Can you help us find folks?\u2019 and they brought us whole binders full of women.\u201d Obama was quick to use the \u201cbinders\u201d line against Romney on the campaign trail on Wednesday. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to collect a bunch of binders to find qualified, talented, driven young women ready to learn and teach in these fields right now,\u201d Obama told supporters in Mount Vernon, Iowa. Undecided women voters who were watching the debate and participating in a focus group in Ohio, reacted positively to Romney\u2019s anecdote during dial-testing for CNN. The responses from the women jumped sharply on-screen when Romney spoke about workplace flexibility. Three of Romney\u2019s former female cabinet members talk about their experience working for Romney when he was governor in an ad put out by the campaign on Thursday. Ellen Roy Herzfelder, who served as Romney\u2019s former secretary of environmental affairs; Jane Edmonds, Romney\u2019s former secretary of workforce; and Beth Lindstrom, former director of consumer affairs and business regulation, all appear in the ad. \u201cHe totally gets working women,\u201d Herzfelder said in the ad.

            "article_content": "Obamas will spend 20th wedding anniversary with the Romneys ... at debate \"Barack doesn't have a big ego,\" Michelle Obama says Family, she said, is \"at the core of this country\" Election \"couldn't be more important for women\" regarding decisions for \"our bodies\" To the political world, October 3 is a high-stakes night in the presidential election. But for first lady Michelle Obama, it\u2019s the date night that wasn\u2019t. \u201cI told Barack, \u2018This, you know, attending a presidential debate on my 20th anniversary is probably the worst way for me to spend (it).\u2019 \u2026 I get so nervous at these debates,\u201d she said in a recent interview alongside her brother, Craig Robinson. 10 debate moments that mattered Twenty years ago, Michelle Robinson wed Barack Obama in a Chicago ceremony. She never would have predicted spending her 20th wedding anniversary on a double date with the Romneys. \u201cI would not have chosen this, but I\u2019m excited about it,\u201d she said. Although the first lady will be in the audience in Denver to watch President Obama debate Wednesday night, she did not offer a critique of her husband, even when pressed. Steve Harvey dreams of golf with Obama Watch Michelle Obama's full speech \u201cI really would probably be the worst person to assess his style or his techniques,\u201d she said. In fact, she suggested that she worries about her own performance, with all eyes judging her every reaction. 5 things to watch in tonight\u2019s debate \u201cThere are the rules, and you don\u2019t want to clap. \u2026 So I\u2019m just trying to make sure I\u2019m following the rules,\u201d Obama said. She may have jitters on debate day, but she was not nervous when she wed young Barack Obama in 1992. Instead, she was focused on the next step: their honeymoon. \u201cIt was just sort of, \u2018OK, now we\u2019re going to do this, and we\u2019ll get it done, and then we\u2019ll go on our honeymoon,\u2019 \u201d she remembered. \u201cSo I was really excited about the honeymoon, actually.\u201d As for the groom, he had a cold. \u201cWe were teasing him about \u2018OK, whatever you do, don\u2019t sneeze while you\u2019re saying your vows,\u201d said Robinson, who served as a groomsman. \u201cI remember we had a big laugh about that.\u201d But the first lady said the future president\u2019s congestion vanished at the altar. \u201cMy sister has that affect on people,\u201d Robinson said with a laugh. Michelle Obama: I can make the president mad Robinson, the older of the siblings, who coaches the Oregon State University basketball team and has hit the court with his brother-in-law, insisted that the president\u2019s playing style is that of a team player. \u201cOne of the first things I saw on the basketball court was his lack of ego,\u201d Robinson said. \u201cThe game wasn\u2019t about him. It was about the game and about his teammates.\u201d Some observers have suggested that it is the first lady who grounds the president and keeps his ego in check, but Obama was adamant that this president is grounded on his own. \u201cBarack doesn\u2019t have a big ego,\u201d she said. \u201cThat would kind of be the last thing that I would think of when I talk about my husband is big ego, because he doesn\u2019t have that. So it\u2019s not much to check.\u201d Before the debate, iReporters square off Their similar values, she said, were part of the reason their union made sense and are something she references on the campaign trail. She has visited all of the battleground states during the 2012 election cycle on behalf of the Democratic ticket, enough stops to have her own stump speech. In her addresses, she describes the values she and her husband hold and how she believes his policies will positively affect voters across the country, particularly those in the middle class. She often says they were both taught the value of hard work. \u201cWe learned that the truth matters, so you don\u2019t take shortcuts or game the system or play by your own set of rules,\u201d she said at a recent campaign stop in Richmond, Virginia, a line oft repeated in her speeches. First lady seeks to reignite flame for president She declined to discuss Mitt Romney\u2019s values in contrast with her husband\u2019s, but she did offer a contrast between herself and Ann Romney. The GOP nominee\u2019s wife recently told her husband\u2019s critics that running for president is hard. But Obama did not echo that sentiment. Ann Romney: \u2018Dad\u2019 is always with Mitt at the debates \u201cThe campaign experience is unique for everyone. \u2026 For me, I really enjoyed campaigning,\u201d she said. \u201cI get energy from it, and I always have. And I\u2019ve always said that. That it\u2019s, I never thought a few years ago that I would enjoy it this much, but I really do.\u201d Despite the first couple\u2019s campaign schedule, they make a point to be home for dinner at 6:30 p.m. The president admitted that might contribute to his difficulty cultivating relationships in the nation\u2019s capital. But the first lady was quick to defend their schedule, saying there is never a downside to family time and suggesting that the 44th president is setting a good example for other fathers across the country. Family, she said, is \u201cat the core of this country.\u201d \u201cI mean, in the end, this is what we\u2019re here for,\u201d she added. \u201cWe\u2019re here to make sure that we\u2019re giving every family an opportunity to have the kind of stability and opportunities for the future, for themselves and for their kids. And I think the best thing we can do is to model that in our own homes.\u201d She said that the Obamas are trying to provide as normal a life as possible for their two daughters, Malia and Sasha, but that neither she nor the president \u201cplays the heavy.\u201d \u201cThis is the thing I like about Barack. \u2026 He is very good at reinforcing the rules and boundaries that we set. We never get into that \u2018but Dad said.\u2019 We\u2019re very good at not letting the kids play off of us,\u201d she said. Michelle Obama convention speech dress dazzles, scores Michelle Obama said the threat of withholding television on the weekends helps keep the girls out of trouble. \u201cThey already have limited TV time,\u201d she said. \u201cTrust me, if you only get two hours on Saturday and to lose those two hours, you don\u2019t.\u201d Although a childhood in the White House is by no means normal, Robinson claimed they still seem like the girls he knew in Chicago. \u201cWhat\u2019s amazing for me is to watch, when I come to the White House, it\u2019s the White House. \u2026 But inside, in the living quarters, watching my sister and the president operate with their family, it\u2019s refreshing, because the only thing that\u2019s different is they\u2019re in the White House,\u201d Robinson said. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t seem normal, because we\u2019re from the South Side of Chicago, but the behavior\u2019s all normal.\u201d The first lady said she is too focused on the November election to offer specifics on what her potential second-term agenda would look like but said she would continue work on issues she\u2019s championed in the president\u2019s first term. She has advocated on behalf of veterans returning home from service and healthy living practices among young people through her Let\u2019s Move campaign. She often speaks to women on the campaign trail; the number of them in poverty has grown during President Obama\u2019s term to a 17-year high. She said this presidential election \u201ccouldn\u2019t be more important for women\u201d when it comes to equal pay, health care and making decisions about \u201cour bodies.\u201d \u201cAs a woman and as a mother with two girls, I want to make sure that my daughters make those decisions for themselves,\u201d Obama said. \u201cSo many issues will impact the quality of our lives as women for decades to come. \u2026 I\u2019m spending a lot of time out there talking to women to make sure that they understand all that\u2019s on the line.\u201d Ann Romney touts her husband\u2019s softer side",

            "article_content": "NEW: \"These are difficult days,\" President Obama says of anti-American unrest Mitt Romney says Obama will be untruthful in the debates Paul Ryan blames Obama for anti-American unrest in Arab nations The Obama campaign calls Ryan's criticism \"over-the-top\" and dishonest Republicans led by presidential challenger Mitt Romney served up a heaping helping of political red meat on Friday, launching a salvo of attacks on President Barack Obama that called him a liar and a failed leader. Romney told an interview broadcast on ABC that his biggest concern about the three upcoming presidential debates is that Obama will be untruthful. \u201cThe president tends to, how shall I say it, to say things that aren\u2019t true,\u201d Romney said, contemplating whether he would spend debate time \u201ccorrecting things that aren\u2019t quite accurate\u201d or \u201ctalking about the things I want to talk about.\u201d In an already nasty and bitter campaign, Romney\u2019s pre-emptive strike less than three weeks before the first debate on Oct. 3 signaled more personal attacks to come as the election campaign gallops toward the November vote. Obama appears to have maintained a narrow edge in most polls, with a new CBS News/New York Times survey released Friday giving him a slight 49%-46% advantage over the former Massachusetts governor. While the president\u2019s margin was within the survey\u2019s sampling error, making the result statistically even, the new survey continued a trend reflected in other polls of Romney failing to gain ground on the president after the recent political conventions. With less than eight weeks until the election, the Romney campaign and GOP political machine have raised the urgency of their efforts. This week, Romney took on one of Obama\u2019s perceived strengths \u2013 his foreign policy record after ending the war in Iraq and ordering the mission that killed al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden \u2013 by saying a lack of U.S. leadership has weakened the nation\u2019s influence throughout the world. In particular, Republican politicians and conservative commentators have cited the killing of U.S. Ambassador Chris Stevens and three other Americans amid anti-American protests in Libya this week as an example of the nation\u2019s weakened stature around the world. At a ceremony Friday to bring home the remains of the slain Americans, Obama acknowledged the unrest in Libya and other Arab Spring nations, saying \u201cthese are difficult days.\u201d \u201cThe United States of America will never retreat from the world,\u201d Obama declared, vowing that the killers will face justice. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton also sought to project American strength and determination, labeling as \u201csenseless\u201d and totally unacceptable\u201d the anti-American unrest she blamed on an \u201cawful\u201d anti-Islam video on the Internet. \u201cThe people of Egypt, Libya, Yemen and Tunisia did not trade the tyranny of a dictator for the tyranny of a mob,\u201d Clinton told the somber ceremony. \u201cReasonable people and responsible leaders in these countries need to do everything they can to restore security and hold accountable those behind these violent acts.  And we will, under the president\u2019s leadership, keep taking steps to protect our personnel around the world.\u201d Both Romney and his running mate \u2013 Rep. Paul Ryan \u2013 mentioned the four slain Americans at   separate campaign events later Friday, asking for a moment of silence after reciting the names of the dead. Earlier, Ryan kept up the attacks on Obama\u2019s foreign policy at a Values Voters summit in Washington hosted by social conservative groups. Referring to the anti-American protests in the Arab world, Ryan complained that Obama has failed to assert U.S. influence and values that could have brought a different result. \u201cThe slaughter of brave dissidents in Syria. Mobs storming American embassies and consulates. Iran four years closer to gaining a nuclear weapon. Israel, our best ally in the region, treated with indifference bordering on contempt by the Obama administration,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cAmid all these threats and dangers, what we do not see is steady, consistent American leadership.\u201d Calling for \u201cmoral clarity and firmness of purpose\u201d in U.S. foreign policy, he added that \u201conly by the confident exercise of American influence are evil and violence overcome.\u201d As he spoke, three protesters shouting about HIV/AIDS funding and corporate money were escorted out as the crowd chanted \u201cUSA.\u201d The protesters were from the \u201cTake the Money Out Of Politics Campaign\u201d group opposed to the Supreme Court\u2019s Citizens United ruling that permitted unlimited private funding of election campaigns. The Obama campaign responded to Ryan\u2019s speech with a statement that called it \u201ca series of over-the-top, dishonest attacks\u201d that showed the 42-year-old congressman was \u201cjust not ready for prime time.\u201d Meanwhile, an array of other speakers at the conservative summit accused Obama of weakening the country. \u201cIt is my belief and my opinion that Barack Obama has been the most dangerous president we have ever had on American foreign policy,\u201d said GOP Rep. Michele Bachmann of Minnesota, a tea party favorite who ran unsuccessfully for the party\u2019s presidential nomination. House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Virginia, told the gathering that the upcoming election \u201cis going to determine whether or not the very moral fabric of our country will be upheld or whether it will be torn apart.\u201d Also Friday, a top foreign policy adviser to Romney\u2019s campaign stood by his argument that this week\u2019s attacks on U.S. diplomatic posts in Libya and Egypt could have been averted if Romney were president. Richard Williamson, a former assistant secretary of state in the Ronald Reagan administration, said Romney\u2019s policies would have led to a better standing for the United States in the Arab Spring countries of recent years. \u201cA Romney administration would be there, would be more active trying to work with civil society, with reformer movements, so we would be partners in this evolution, not running behind,\u201d Williamson said on CNN\u2019s \u201cStarting Point.\u201d Regarding Egypt, Williamson cited what he called a lack of U.S. involvement after the Egyptian protests of 2011, which ultimately led to the resignation of President Hosni Mubarak. In Libya, Williamson argued, the United States should have been more active in \u201creconciliation and reconstruction\u201d after a multi-country coalition took military action against Libyan forces with American help. Romney drew criticism for blasting the Obama administration on Tuesday night \u2013 the 11th anniversary of the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on the United States \u2013 for a statement by the U.S. Embassy in Cairo that condemned the anti-Islam video. However, Romney\u2019s statement inaccurately said the embassy statement \u2013 which came out before protesters invaded the compound \u2013 was in response to the demonstration. Romney has since toned down his sharpest rhetoric on the matter but kept up the main theme, telling a New York fundraiser on Friday that \u201cthere have been, over the years, confusing messages sent by the president of the United States to the world.\u201d In particular, Romney argued that Obama \u201chad nothing to say that sent a message to the world\u201d during the 2009 anti-government protests in Iran, adding the president should have given direct assistance to the demonstrators. At the time, several months into his presidency, Obama condemned violence against the Iranian protesters but not did lead or call for U.S. involvement in Iran\u2019s post-election unrest. Foreign policy was not the only GOP focus on Friday. Ryan maintained the Romney campaign\u2019s criticism of Obama\u2019s record on economic issues as part of an effort to frame the November vote as a referendum on the president\u2019s performance. \u201cAfter four years of economic stewardship under these self-proclaimed advocates of the poor, and what do they have to show for it? More people in poverty, and less upward mobility wherever you look,\u201d said the conservative House Budget Committee chairman from Wisconsin. \u201cAfter four years of dividing people up with the bogus rhetoric of class warfare, just about every segment of society is worse off.\u201d In the ABC interview, Romney conceded a rare shared stance with Obama, saying the two would draw the same \u201cred line\u201d on nuclear weapons in Iran. \u201cMy red line is Iran may not have a nuclear weapon. It is inappropriate for them to have the capacity to terrorize the world,\u201d Romney said. \u201cIran as a nuclear nation is unacceptable to the United States of America.\u201d Obama has used almost identical language to describe the situation in Iran, and Romney said \u201cyes\u201d when asked in the interview if the two candidates would have the same \u201cred line\u201d going forward.

Republicans aggressively pushed their convention theme, \u201cWe Built It,\u201d while Democrats sought to turn it back on Mitt Romney, who was affirmed as the nominee by a roll call of delegates in the first significant moments of the event. Republicans highlighted a remark by President Barack Obama, who said in July that public investment in infrastructure helps businesses grow. \u201cIf you are successful, somebody along the line gave you some help. \u2026 If you\u2019ve got a business, you didn\u2019t build that,\u201d Obama said at the time. Ryan builds on Obama comment in Roanoke GOP stars throw support behind Romney Dems crashing the party in Tampa L.A.'s top Democrat in Tampa during RNC Rebutting the GOP message Republicans have seized on the comment to suggest that Obama is out of touch with small business owners and does not understand how the private sector works.  Democrats, however, contend that their rivals are taking things out of context. \u201cSo as Republicans continue to distort the president\u2019s words and push their \u2018We built that\u2019 theme in Tampa,\u201d Los Angeles Mayor Antonio Villaraigosa said from the \u201cwar room\u201d Democrats have set up in downtown Tampa near the convention site. \u201cIt\u2019s worth asking: What did [Mitt] Romney build?\u201d Villaraigosa, chair of next week\u2019s Democratic convention in Charlotte, answered his own question - \u201cA bank account in Switzerland, investments in Bermuda and the Caymans, and an inexplicably large IRA. That\u2019s what he built.\u201d Democrats are trying to nail Romney with a one-two punch: casting him as wealthy and privileged and saying that his policies would hurt the middle class. \u201cA stronger, growing middle class means a stronger, growing American economy,\u201d Maryland Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley said, \u201cAnd that\u2019s really what this election is all about.\u201d   \u201cOn a national scale, Romney economics would spell disaster for America\u2019s middle class, would be wrong for America\u2019s middle class, would not grow our middle class.  And, in fact, would harm our middle class,\u201d O\u2019Malley added. On Romney\u2019s tenure at the top of Boston private equity firm Bain Capital, O\u2019Malley said the Republican\u2019s goal when investing in troubled companies was not creating jobs.  Instead, O\u2019Malley suggested that the firm under Romney destroyed businesses and jobs in order to generate profit for investors. \u201cIn this economy, there are shipbuilders and there are ship-wreckers,\u201d O\u2019Malley said. \u201cThere are those who manufacture automobiles and there are those who scrap automobiles.  There are those who build up and create things and there are those who make a quick profit by dismantling things.\u201d The Romney campaign quickly fired back. In an email, Romney spokesman Ryan Williams accused Democrats of launching \u201cfalse and baseless attacks\u201d against the former Massachusetts governor whose tenure at the firm prior to his public life made him wealthy. \u201cThe facts speak for themselves,\u201d Williams said, \u201cwith 23 million Americans struggling for work, nearly one in six Americans living in poverty, and median incomes declining, the Obama campaign cannot defend a record of broken promises and failed policies. Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan have a plan to strengthen the middle class by creating jobs and turning around our economy.\u201d Asked at the event about recent polling indicating the public views Romney stronger on handling the economy, Obama senior adviser Robert Gibbs countered. Gibbs pointed to other recent polling data suggesting the public is more partial to Obama on the questions of who cares about people and who cares about the middle class. \u201cI think those polls demonstrate overwhelmingly that the president is their pick,\u201d Gibbs said. CNN Poll: Which candidate cares more about you? CNN Poll: Which candidate is better on the issues? The event was the latest salvo in an escalating pace of aggressive campaigning, rhetoric, and attacks on the part of both presidential campaigns. In a break from tradition, the president is out campaigning this week while Republicans hold their nominating convention.  Speaking in Iowa Tuesday, Obama said he expects the event to be a \u201cpretty entertaining show.\u201d Obama renews push with young voters \u201cI\u2019m sure they\u2019ll, you know, have some wonderful things to say about me,\u201d he joked.

            "article_content": "NEW: White House says health care fine for lacking insurance is not a tax Opponents target the health care law after the Supreme Court upholds it Sen. Mitch McConnell says President Obama deceived the nation about the law Democrats note that Mitt Romney backed the concept as Massachusetts governor Republicans launched a blistering attack Friday on the health care reform law upheld by the Supreme Court, seeking to rally their base\u2019s opposition to the measure to bolster their fortunes in the November election. Using the court\u2019s finding that the centerpiece of the law \u2013 the individual mandate \u2013 amounted to a legal exercise of congressional taxing power, GOP leaders accused President Barack Obama and Democrats of deceiving the nation about the Affordable Care Act during debate on the measure in 2009 and 2010. Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky led the charge, saying Democrats used a \u201cdeeply dishonest sales pitch\u201d to overcome public opposition to the measure back then. \u201cNearly every day since then, the promises that formed the heart of that sales pitch have been exposed for the false promises they were,\u201d McConnell said on the Senate floor, adding that the Supreme Court decision Thursday provided \u201cpowerful confirmation of what may have been the biggest deception of all.\u201d He urged Democrats to stop \u201ctrying to defend the indefensible\u201d and join with Republicans to repeal the health care law. Health care ruling gives GOP new attack line Obama said mandate isn't tax in 2009 Health care questions answered How will law affect health care costs? Health care ruling energizes voters Meanwhile, Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minnesota, a tea party favorite and leading opponent of health care reform, said she and congressional colleagues were sending a letter to state officials urging them not to implement the health care bill until after the November vote. \u201cAll across job creator boardrooms today, decisions are being made by millions of employers to drop the employer covered health insurance,\u201d Bachmann claimed Friday on CNN. \u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019re telling the states just stop, take a breath, because we\u2019re going to turn the economy around after November.\u201d The polarizing law is the signature legislation of Obama\u2019s time in office, and opposition to it helped spur the creation of the conservative tea party movement. Friday\u2019s rhetoric by McConnell and other Republicans reflected their shock and anger at the high court decision, which rejected the challenges of opponents who contended the health care law was unconstitutional. Breaking down the court\u2019s decision In a 5-4 ruling, the court decided the individual mandate requiring people to have health insurance was valid as a tax, even though it was impermissible under the Constitution\u2019s Commerce Clause. The most anticipated Supreme Court ruling in years allows the government to continue implementing the health care law, which doesn\u2019t take full effect until 2014. That means popular provisions that prohibit insurers from denying coverage for pre-existing medical conditions and allow parents to keep their children on family policies to the age of 26 will continue. Opinion: Chief Justice Roberts: The decider However, Republican opponents of the law\u2019s expansion of government vowed to continue fighting to repeal it, with certain presidential nominee Mitt Romney saying that defeating Obama in November is the only way to meet that goal. Both presidential campaigns are citing fundraising spikes after the Supreme Court\u2019s decision. Romney\u2019s organization said Friday that it had raised $4.6 million online, and Obama\u2019s operation, while not revealing specific numbers, said it had surpassed that total. The individual mandate is the linchpin of the health care law signed by Obama in 2010 after an epic brawl in Congress in which no Republicans supported the measure. Obama has denied that the mandate is a tax, including in a 2009 interview with ABC in which he compared it to state requirements that motorists carry auto insurance. \u201cNobody considers that a tax increase,\u201d Obama said then. \u201cPeople say to themselves, \u2018that is a fair way to make sure that if you hit my car, that I\u2019m not covering all the costs.\u2019 \u201c At least 4 million people are expected to pay a penalty for not having health insurance when the rule takes full effect in 2016, bringing in about $54 billion to help offset the $1.7 trillion, 10-year cost of the act, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office. It\u2019s one of several revenue-raising provisions in the health care law, according to Lawrence Jacobs, a University of Minnesota political scientist and co-author of a 2010 book on the health care battle. Who\u2019s going to treat you? Under the health care law when it is fully implemented in coming years, most Americans will be covered by employee health plans, either their own or that of a head of household, or by existing government programs such as Medicare, Medicaid or veterans\u2019 benefits, Jacobs noted. Of the roughly 6% of the population remaining, a large portion of those will be exempted from the mandate because of poverty, religious beliefs or other reasons, he said. White House spokesman Jay Carney said Friday that the fine for failing to have health insurance once the law is fully implemented is \u201ca penalty, because you have a choice\u201d of whether to obtain it. \u201cIf you don\u2019t buy it, and you can afford it, it is an irresponsible thing to do to ask the rest of America\u2019s taxpayers to pay for your care when you go to the emergency room,\u201d Carney said. \u201cSo your choice is to purchase health (insurance), or a penalty will be administered.\u201d By the numbers: Health insurance Bachmann\u2019s allegation that the health care law would lead to fewer U.S. jobs was challenged on CNN by Democratic Gov. Jack Markell of Delaware. \u201cIf they\u2019re not hiring, it\u2019s because they don\u2019t have demand,\u201d Markell said. \u201cWhat they care most about when they\u2019re deciding whether to hire is where do they have access to the greatest work force. I mean, these charges are just ridiculous.\u201d Democrats also noted that Romney, as governor of Massachusetts, implemented an individual mandate similar to the concept in the federal law. Romney contends that the Massachusetts law was tailored to the state\u2019s needs and that such a solution was improper at the federal level. He called the law known as Obamacare bad policy and a bad law on the federal level. That didn\u2019t stop Democratic Rep. Steve Israel of New York from noting on CNN that Romney \u201cactually defended what he called a penalty\u201d during his term as Massachusetts governor. \u201cNot my words, Mitt Romney\u2019s words, were the free riders \u2013 who chose not to get health insurance but shift those costs onto society \u2013 need to pay their fair share,\u201d Israel said. \u201cI didn\u2019t call them free riders. Mitt Romney did.\u201d In Thursday\u2019s majority opinion, Chief Justice John Roberts wrote that \u201cthe federal government does not have the power to order people to buy health insurance. \u2026 The federal government does have the power to impose a tax on those without health insurance.\u201d Roberts joined the high court\u2019s liberal wing \u2013 Justices Stephen Breyer, Ruth Bader Ginsburg, Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan \u2013 in upholding the law. Read the ruling (PDF) Four conservative justices \u2013 Samuel Alito, Antonin Scalia, Anthony Kennedy and Clarence Thomas \u2013 dissented. \u201cTo say that the individual mandate merely imposes a tax is not to interpret the statute but to rewrite it,\u201d the dissenting justices wrote in their opinion. \u201cImposing a tax through judicial legislation inverts the constitutional scheme, and places the power to tax in the branch of government least accountable to the citizenry.\u201d How the court voted An NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll released Tuesday indicated that 37% of Americans would have been pleased if the law had been found unconstitutional, compared with 28% who would have been pleased if it had been found constitutional. And the poll of 1,000 U.S. adults found that nearly four in 10 surveyed would have \u201cmixed feelings\u201d had the justices struck down the whole law. Obama, in televised remarks, called Thursday\u2019s Supreme Court ruling a victory for the nation. He used the focus on the issue to spell out the benefits of the law that remains unpopular with many Americans. The principle upheld by the high court\u2019s ruling is that no American should go bankrupt because of illness, the president said. \u201cI know the debate over this law has been divisive,\u201d Obama said. \u201cIt should be pretty clear that I didn\u2019t do this because it was good politics. I did it because I believe it is good for the country.\u201d He said the country can\u2019t afford \u201cto refight the political battle of two years ago or go back to the way things were.\u201d House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi of California, who helped push through the law when she was House speaker, cited the late Sen. Edward Kennedy of Massachusetts, a longtime proponent of health care reform who died before the bill became law. \u201cNow he can rest in peace,\u201d she said, echoing what she\u2019d earlier told Kennedy\u2019s widow by phone. In his opinion, Roberts appeared to note the political divisions, writing that \u201cwe do not consider whether the act embodies sound policies.\u201d \u201cThat judgment is entrusted to the nation\u2019s elected leaders,\u201d the opinion said. \u201cWe ask only whether Congress has the power under the Constitution to enact the challenged provisions.\u201d The narrow focus of the ruling on key issues such as the individual mandate \u2013 limiting it to taxing powers rather than general commerce \u2013 represented the court\u2019s effort to limit the government\u2019s authority. \u201cThe framers created a federal government of limited powers and assigned to this court the duty of enforcing those limits,\u201d Roberts wrote. \u201cThe court does so today.\u201d In another part of Thursday\u2019s decision, the high court ruled that a part of the law involving Medicaid must change. The law calls for an expansion of eligibility for Medicaid, which involves spending by the federal government and the states, and threatens to remove existing Medicaid funding from states that don\u2019t participate in the expansion. Thursday\u2019s ruling said the government must remove that threat.",

            "article_content": "The controversial individual mandate is deemed constitutional as a tax matter Americans must have health care coverage -- or face fines The ruling will continue to play a role this year's presidential election The law will allow more people access to preventive screening The U.S. Supreme Court made a landmark ruling Thursday upholding the controversial, massive reform of health care coverage initiated by President Barack Obama. Here are four things Americans learned about the federal government\u2019s grand vision to ensure health care for everyone under so-called Obamacare: Skipping insurance no longer an option The individual mandate is the centerpiece of the Affordable Care Act, the Obama administration\u2019s signature law. The mandate, which the high court let stand, requires most Americans to have health care insurance. Obamacare survives, but at what cost? Supreme Court sides with Obama Gonzalez: Roberts still conservative Romney: I'll do what justices didn't Opponents had contended that the government couldn\u2019t force citizens to buy health coverage, but the Supreme Court ruled Thursday that the individual mandate is legal under the government\u2019s taxing powers. The \u201ctax\u201d comes in the form of a financial penalty on certain individuals who do not obtain health insurance, and the Constitution allows for such a tax, the court said. The justices, however, found problems in how the law threatens to remove Medicaid funding \u2013 the government\u2019s health coverage for the poor \u2013 from states that don\u2019t participate in an expansion of eligibility. The court said that the government must remove that threat, and Obama acknowledged remedies are needed. The year 2014 is the deadline for everyone to get insurance. Not obtaining insurance in 2014 will cost a person $95 or 1% of his or her income, whichever is higher. In 2015, it\u2019s $325, or 2% of income. For families, the penalty will be $285 per household or 1% of income, whichever is greater. By 2016, it goes up to $2,085 per family or 2.5% of income. Penalties will rise each year. Health care ruling gives GOP new attack line \u2013 taxes The law promises improved collective health The law does promise better care and better health for America \u2013 at a cost. Federal health spending is projected to grow from 5.6% of gross domestic product in 2011 to about 9.4% by 2035, according to the Kaiser Family Foundation. Under the law, preventive care services such as mammograms, physical exams, colonoscopies and vaccinations will be fully covered by insurance companies. This requirement kicked in for new health insurance plans that began on or after September 2010. Without the individual mandate, 40 million Americans would have remained uninsured, researchers at the Urban Institute\u2019s Health Policy Center estimated. Had the health care law been struck down by the high court, those without insurance would have grown by millions, researchers at the Urban Institute said. Without the law, \u201cin the worst case scenario, the number of uninsured Americans would increase to 57.7 million in 2014 and to 65.7 million in 2019. In the best case, the number grows to 53.1 million in 2014 and 57 million in 2019,\u201d the researchers wrote. \u2018Obamacare\u2019 symbol: Court ruling is \u2018right direction\u2019 Uninsured not the only ones who\u2019ll see a change Many Americans are already covered by employers\u2019 health benefits. At companies with fewer than 50 workers, the employees must obtain insurance themselves. Companies with 50 or more full-time employees must start providing health insurance for all workers by 2014 or face stiff penalties. Cash-strapped entrepreneurs can buy insurance at state exchanges and can get tax credits if their annual individual income ranges between 100% and 400% of the poverty line, which this year translates to $11,170 and $44,680. Solo entrepreneurs and small businesses can shop for less expensive insurance through the exchanges in each state. One-person businesses can also turn to exchanges for individuals. Companies with up to 100 workers may turn to Small Business Health Options Programs. Both keep down costs by increasing the size of the insured pool and spreading out the risk. No exchange is up and running yet. In theory, though, the exchanges will give small firms the ability to buy insurance at rates once belonging to large companies. By the numbers: Health insurance Both parties will look to benefit politically from ruling On Thursday, Republicans indicated that the health care law will be a major issue in this year\u2019s presidential election. Obama, a Democrat, agreed. Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney said that, if elected, he would seek to overturn the law. Both candidates were leveraging the conflict to raise money for their respective campaigns. \u201cWhat the court did not do on the last day in session, I will do on my first day if elected president of the United States, and that is that I will act to repeal Obamacare,\u201d Romney said two hours after the ruling was handed down. Despite his pledge to repeal the law, if elected, Romney has promised to continue some of the law\u2019s consumer protections, such as the ban on preventing care based on pre-existing conditions. Said Obama: \u201cI know that there will be a lot discussion about this, about who won and who lost. That\u2019s how these things tend to be viewed here in Washington. But that discussion completely misses the point.\u201d He said Thursday that the principle upheld by the high court\u2019s ruling is that no American should go bankrupt because of illness.

Charlie Rangel\u2019s journey from Harlem\u2019s favorite son to politically embattled Washington insider to campaign victor is a saga that spans more than 40 years and is the type of tale that only seems possible in the soap opera-like world of inside the Beltway politics. Rangel\u2019s comeback tale is as much a testament to his political savvy as it is the resiliency of the area he represents. \u201cOne of the great things about Charlie Rangel is his longevity. And there are lots of people who see his ability to stay on the game as representative of Harlem,\u201d said Mark Anthony Neal, an African-American studies professor at Duke University and author of \u201cNew Black Man: Rethinking Black Masculinity.\u201d \u201cThe idea of Harlem always being on the ropes and being able to bounce back, that\u2019s been the story of Rangel\u2019s political career.\u201d Rangel claimed victory Tuesday in the Democratic primary to represent a redrawn, largely Latino New York district, capping a tale of political survival for the lawmaker, whose House colleagues censured him for ethics violations after his re-election to his 21st term in 2010. On Tuesday night, he offered relieved thanks to supporters at his campaign headquarters in New York after clinching the five-way race for the nomination in his Harlem-area district. The new 13th Congressional District stretches from East Harlem to the northwest Bronx. Longtime lawmakers defy the odds Rangel: 'Fired up, ready to fight' Rangel: My career will end in dignity \u201cThey\u2019ve had enough trust in me, they say, \u2018Rangel, we think you can do it. We want you on our team in the Bronx,\u2019 \u201d he said. \u201cAnd so I can tell everybody who don\u2019t know this district or the Bronx, when I\u2019m walking the streets of the Bronx, I feel my district and the blood and the minds and the ambitions and the things that people want for their children.\u201d Rangel netted about 45% of the vote, compared with his closest rival, New York state Sen. Adriano Espaillat, who got about 40% in the latest count. Rangel received 80% of the vote in the 2010 primary. Espaillat, 57, who would have been the first Dominican-American to serve in the House, used his background to court Latino votes and take aim at the 82-year-old Rangel over his long tenure in Washington and his ethics abuses. On Tuesday, Espaillat sent a note to supporters, thanking them and conceding the race. \u201cThough we didn\u2019t make it to the finish line tonight, the values we fought for and the communities we seek to improve will continue to light a fire in us,\u201d he said. \u201cThe truth is, even in coming a bit short, we made history.\u201d Rangel knows about fighting. He grew up in poverty, was abandoned by his Puerto Rican father and lived with an aunt and uncle in the Bronx. The high school dropout enlisted in the Army and was awarded the Bronze Star for valor in the Korean War after he helped rescue 40 men trapped behind Chinese lines. After the war, he used the GI Bill of Rights to earn a degree from New York University and a law degree from St. John\u2019s University. He served as an assistant U.S. attorney before being elected to the New York State Assembly in 1966. Rangel began his long run in the U.S. House in 1970 when he defeated another flamboyant and beloved longtime Harlem politician, Rep. Adam Clayton Powell Jr., in the Democratic primary. Years later, he defeated Powell\u2019s son in the 2010 Democratic primary. But in his most recent contest, the congressman faced changing demographics and a redrawn district with more Latino-Americans than African-Americans, a shift that helped Espaillat. Though he now represents a district that is more heavily Latino, the African-American community\u2019s traditionally higher voter turnout rates helped Rangel win, said David Wasserman, editor of House races for the Cook Political Report. \u201cHis 2010 primary was more of a referendum on ethics. This was more a test of ethnic strength and a referendum on Rangel\u2019s fitness for office,\u201d Wasserman said. \u201cHe delivered a more tenacious campaign closer to Election Day, and he was able to count on very loyal support to win a low-turnout primary.\u201d Rangel, one-time chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee, was censured by the lower chamber in 2010 after he was found guilty of ethics violations. He failed to pay income taxes for a rental unit in the Dominican Republic, filed misleading financial disclosure reports and set up his campaign office in a building where he lives, among other breaches. Pundits predicted an end to his political career at the time, pointing to previous ethics problems and the potential of redistricting after the 2010 census. \u201cThe power of incumbency was on full display when Rep. Charlie Rangel won his primary on Tuesday,\u201d said  Thomas Schatz, president of Citizens Against Government Waste, a watchdog group. \u201cWhile Congress\u2019 rating is in the single digits and several incumbents have lost primaries around the country, Rep. Rangel is still extremely popular in Harlem. His re-election is both a testament to his longevity and a reflection of his constituents, who clearly don\u2019t seem to mind his ethical lapses. \u201d Still, the dapper lawmaker has a core of ardent supporters. \u201cHe is a consummate public servant, and public service is not easy whenever your life is open for constant scrutiny and everything you do is under a microscope,\u201d said New York state Assemblyman Keith L.T. Wright, a co-chairman of the state Democratic Party. \u201cHe\u2019s from Harlem. We\u2019ve done nothing but have to fight for whatever we have to achieve.\u201d In Congress, Rangel was among the leading voices in the fight against drug trafficking, pushed for low-income housing tax credits and authored legislation to support urban communities. He became the first African-American chairman of the powerful Ways and Means Committee after Democrats won control of the House in 2006. He also helped create the Congressional Black Caucus, an organization that represents African-American members of Congress. Despite the new district lines and some recent health problems, Rangel fought hard to keep his seat, squaring off with his opponents in debates and taking them on during campaign stops. \u201cOne of my opponents said that I got the idea that I\u2019m the only person that can do the job, that I\u2019m the smartest person in the world and no one is smart enough to do it. I said, \u2018That\u2019s not so. I\u2019m just smarter than you,\u2019 \u201d Rangel said last week, according to CNN affiliate WCBS-TV. Rangel and Espaillat faced fellow Democrats Joyce Johnson, a business executive; former Rangel intern Craig Schley; and former Bill Clinton aide Clyde Williams to win control of the 13th Congressional District. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo endorsed Rangel on Friday, citing his decades of service and ability to \u201cbring things back to the state of New York.\u201d However, New York\u2019s three major daily newspapers each endorsed a different one of Rangel\u2019s opponents, prompting a fierce defense from the New York City native. And on Tuesday, though a bit chastened by his tough political slog, he offered a bit of trademark spark. \u201cIf (the newspaper editorial boards) didn\u2019t think, after 42 years, that I was the best qualified, I promise them in the next two years, they\u2019ll have no question of the fact that you elected the best.\u201d CNN\u2019s Gabriella Schwarz and Alan Silverleib contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "The court could use an obscure act to sidestep the decision until after the election The key issue is the individual mandate Three federal appeals courts have upheld the mandate; one has rejected it as unconstitutional The Supreme Court in coming days will issue perhaps as many as four separate opinions on the constitutionality of the health care law. The Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act (PPACA or ACA) was signed into law March 23, 2010, passed by a Democratic congressional majority and championed by President Barack Obama. It has about 2,700 pages and contains 450 some provisions. Here are the four issues the high court tackled separately during oral arguments in late March. Those issues are expected to play key roles in the judges\u2019 final decisions. The gateway issue: Anti-Injunction Act Would those challenging the law be barred from making any legal or constitutional claims until the key provision \u2013 the individual mandate \u2013 goes into effect in 2014? The obscure Anti-Injunction Act, dating back 145 years, prevents asking for a refund on a tax until that tax has been collected and paid. Judges in two federal appeals courts have made that \u201cthreshold\u201d argument, which would effectively stop the current legal fight in its tracks. Citing that law might give the court\u2013 particularly its conservative members \u2013 a way out of deciding the explosive issue in an election year. The majority could decide that the political branches can best resolve the conflicts, at least for now, or that the matter can be handled after the November elections. It could potentially delay a decision on the constitutionality of the individual mandate for at least four years. The key Issue: Individual mandate This provision would require nearly all Americans to buy some form of health insurance beginning in 2014 or face financial penalties. May the federal government, under the Constitution\u2019s Commerce Clause, regulate economic \u201cinactivity?\u201d Three federal appeals courts have found the PPACA to be constitutional, while another has said it is not, labeling it \u201cbreathtaking in its expansive scope.\u201d That \u201ccircuit split\u201d all but assured the Supreme Court would step in to decide the matter. A coalition of 26 states led by Florida says that individuals cannot be forced to buy insurance, a \u201cproduct\u201d they may neither want nor need. The Justice Department has countered that, since every American will need medical care at some point, individuals do not \u201cchoose\u201d to participate in the health care market. Federal officials cite 2008 figures of $43 billion in uncompensated costs incurred by millions of uninsured people who receive health services, costs that are typically shifted to insurance companies and passed on to their insurees. The domino effect issue: Severability If the individual mandate section is ruled unconstitutional, must the entire law collapse? Affordable care act: What's on the line? A federal judge in Florida so ruled in February 2011: \u201cBecause the individual mandate is unconstitutional and not severable, the entire Act must be declared void.\u201d But a federal appeals court subsequently overruled on the severability question, while upholding the individual mandate\u2019s unconstitutionality. Opponents of the law say the individual mandate is crucial to its overall impact, since it is the main funding mechanism for the expansion of a range of other programs. This might be one question on which the justices will ultimately agree in favor of the government. The national policy issue: Medicaid \u201ccoercion\u201d Can states be forced by the federal government to expand their share of Medicaid costs and administration, with the risk of losing that funding if they refuse? The 28 GOP-led states bringing separate lawsuits say the new law\u2019s expansion of the social safety net unconstitutionally \u201ccoerces\u201d state governments. That program is administered by the states with a combination of federal and state money, currently requiring coverage only for poor children and their parents or caretakers, adults with disabilities and poor individuals 65 or older. The \u201ccoercion\u201d issue was surprisingly added to the health care debate by the justices. Overall impact Both sides of the issue agree that whatever the high court decides on these four questions could have monumental implications for the federal government\u2019s ability to set long-term national policy goals in areas such as the environment, education and the workplace. Some states have long complained their autonomy is being eroded by creeping federal intervention on spending matters. Article 1 of the Constitution gives Congress the power \u201clay and collect \u2026 taxes to pay the debts and provide for the common defense and general welfare of the United States\u201d and to \u201cregulate commerce \u2026 among the several states.\u201d Such authority has long been broadly interpreted, including when imposing conditions on recipients, be they individuals or states. No federal court has ever ruled that states have been unlawfully coerced when they accept conditions attached to federal funds. The Supreme Court in 1987 affirmed that congressional discretion. Timeline of the health care law Starting in 2014, PPACA\u2019s Medicaid changes would make millions of additional Americans eligible for benefits by raising the income level under which they would still qualify. That would include all adults living at up to 133% of the federal poverty line. The tricky question is that states are not forced to agree to the law\u2019s incremental Medicaid increases, which would be spread out over six years. But the states say that abandoning their participation as a result would result in a financial, social and political catastrophe. Their needy citizens rely on Medicaid, states argue, but the law\u2019s expansion of the program could cripple state budgets, currently on average about 20%. That could threaten other state spending priorities. So the long-standing fight over \u201cfederalism\u201d and the leverage the national government wields over states might soon reach epic levels with a high court decision either strengthening or limiting congressional authority on this and potentially a host of other regulatory areas.

Bobbie Cleave, a retired teacher in Utah, has put off plans to get a badly needed car. Brian Chandler, a data manager in metro Atlanta, is delaying buying a house, despite needing space for his second child due any day now. Retired police officer Richard Huffman of Michigan may ditch plans to re-enter the work force. No fiscal cliff deal in sight King: The battle over Medicare Counting down to the fiscal cliff Newt Gingrich on fiscal cliff And several families CNN spoke with said they\u2019re shrinking the gift pile beneath the Christmas tree. As the nation approaches the so-called \u201cfiscal cliff,\u201d people are taking steps to cushion their families from the plunge. To them, the threat to the nation\u2019s economy requires preparation \u2013 particularly with President Barack Obama warning that going off the cliff could cost the average family of four more than $2,000. But some say the fears are just hype. And others see an upside. \u201cWe need to go over the cliff,\u201d says Valerie Stayskal, 58-year-old owner of two small businesses in Addison, Illinois. As Congress and the White House battle over the $7 trillion worth of tax increases and spending cuts that could start to take effect in January, CNN reached out to people in various walks of life to find out how they\u2019re already being affected. From my home to the House: How to fix the fiscal cliff The country is \u2018stuck again\u2019 \u201cThe fiscal cliff is just one more thing that makes us wait, feel unsure,\u201d says Cleave, 61, who is also a wilderness ranger in Salt Lake City. She shared her perspective recently with CNN iReport. The economic collapse of 2008 left a lot of people \u201cstuck,\u201d she says. She was \u201cstuck\u201d trying to sell her house, then felt \u201cunstuck a bit\u201d when Obama was first elected \u201cbecause we hoped he could change things.\u201d  But things didn\u2019t change enough.  \u201cWe felt unstuck again this election,\u201d because the country seemed to send a resounding message about the kind of economic action it wants, including raising taxes on the wealthiest, she said. \u201cBut now we feel stuck again\u201d because there\u2019s no sign of a compromise.  \u201cIt means we freeze, we don\u2019t buy as much, we save, we wait.\u201d Cleave\u2019s family is Buddhist, \u201cso we meditate on living with the feeling of uncertainty,\u201d she says.  \u201cIt\u2019s part of life.  But I think many people are in waiting and saving mode because they feel confused about how this will all play out.\u201d Lela Ladd is one of them.  Her family in McCook, Nebraska, is \u201cliving frugally, anticipating future tax increases,\u201d she says. \u201cMy husband and I are not exchanging Christmas gifts.  In the past, we spent about $500 on each other.\u201d The couple has three children and eight grandchildren \u2013 each of whom will receive only one gift each from them this year That frugality was already spurred by the hard times of the last several years, but the \u201ccliff\u201d is adding to that stress. \u201cIt is hard not to be angry at our elected officials,\u201d says Ladd, 57, a self-employed insurance agent. \u201cThey have forgotten why we elected them: to watch out for our country. They really don\u2019t know what it is like to walk in our shoes. You have to be rich to be elected to anything anymore, so the working class is no longer represented.\u201d Surveys show most Americans want compromise on Capitol Hill.  A Gallup Poll found 62% want Democrats and Republicans to reach a deal. But many doubt it will happen.  A Washington Post/Pew Research Center poll found 49% of Americans do not expect an agreement by the end of the year, while 40% do. The frustration and fear could slice holiday sales, as people try to hold on to some cash, the National Retail Federation warns. It\u2019s too soon to know whether the cliff fears are having a Grinch-like impact, and sales so far have hit new highs.  But the federation is concerned about the weeks ahead. \u201cBefore Thanksgiving, the threat of the fiscal cliff seemed remote to most Americans,\u201d says David French, the NRF\u2019s top lobbyist, who is pushing both parties for action on the issue.  \u201cNow, more and more people are focused on it, and the threat is becoming more real\u2026  It\u2019s uncomfortable for retailers.\u201d Same players, same disputes in fiscal cliff debate Government-style accounting would put a business \u2018in jail,\u2019 owner says Owners of two small businesses in New Jersey told CNN they\u2019re nervous and frustrated. Any business that followed the same \u201cmethod of accounting as our government\u201d would \u201cbe in jail,\u201d complains Bob Bellagamba, CEO of Concorde Worldwide, a limousine company. He wants a decision on the fiscal cliff \u201cso I know how to run my business.\u201d  Depending on the outcome, he may have to lay off some employees, he said. Charles Altiero, owner of Freehold Jewelers, said tax increases might help him in one way. \u201cMore people are going to have to sell their gold to pay their taxes.\u201d But it would hurt his customers\u2019 buying power. So, he said, he\u2019s open to the idea of paying more taxes to help avoid going off the \u201ccliff.\u201d Reliable Refuse Removal in Opal, Wyoming, has dropped an annual tradition. \u201cWe normally present our biggest customers with appreciation gifts. This year everyone gets a card,\u201d said Mary Hall, who owns the business with her husband. That\u2019s due to the state of the economy in general, including the fiscal cliff, she said. Hall, a mother of five, is also the small town\u2019s mayor. \u201cI can see it affecting the programs we participate in with regard to funding for capital improvements,\u201d she said.  No programs have been cut yet due to the fiscal cliff, but \u201cas the federal government starts cutting and limiting spending, the states tend to tighten their belts as well,\u201d she said. Tax increases would make it \u2018not worth\u2019 re-entering work force The belt-tightening many Americans have been doing for years prompted Richard Huffman,a 63-year-old retired cop and CNN iReporter in Saint Joseph, Michigan, to consider re-entering the work force.  He has six daughters and 14 grandchildren. Now, he\u2019s changing his mind.  \u201cI will not go back into the work force if taxes are to go up on the middle class,\u201d he says.  So much of the money he would make would go to taxes that it wouldn\u2019t be worth working.  \u201cThese tax increases would take away from our income drastically.\u201d \u2018I\u2019m being penalized for wealth\u2019 It\u2019s not just members of the middle class who are nervous about what lies ahead. Brian Chandler, a 34-year-old in Marietta, Georgia, says he\u2019s among those Americans with incomes over $250,000 whose taxes would go up under Obama\u2019s plan. \u201cI am technically considered \u2018rich,\u2019\u201d says Chandler. \u201cI did this through hard work, long hours, taking on work that clearly wasn\u2019t my responsibility, networking, etc.  Now it sort of feels like I\u2019m being penalized for that, in higher taxes, because of others\u2019 lack of financial responsibility.\u201d \u201cI am concerned about the reduction of take-home income. I am also concerned taxing those above $250,000 a year may counter innovation and prevent some from working as hard as they do to earn that amount of money.\u201d He and his wife have a son, and their daughter is due this month.  They need more space. But he\u2019s no longer looking for a bigger home.  \u201cI\u2019m watching how it will all play out.\u201d The road to the fiscal cliff paved with good intentions In support of \u2018cliff\u2019 diving While polls show it to be a minority, there is a contingent of Americans who want the country to go off the fiscal cliff. \u201cIt will help because it will finally reduce the deficit with substance \u2013 not just words,\u201d says Valerie Stayskal of Addison, Illinois.  It will be painful for several years, but best in the long term, the mother of three and soon-to-be grandmother of twins argues. \u201cI want my kids and their kids to have a good life in a country that is stable and flourishing.  I want them to have opportunity.  If we don\u2019t dig deep into the deficit, they are made to be burdened with this debt.\u201d Patrick Drake, of Norcross, Georgia, offers another upside.  All the talk about the fiscal cliff \u201cis very necessary for citizens and representatives to inform and engage,\u201d he says. \u201cDefinitely, I have never been a financially responsible individual until I began paying attention to the fiscal cliff discussions and the correlation to my personal finances.\u201d \u2018It\u2019s all hype!\u2019 But some others say they\u2019re sick of all the talk \u2013 which, they believe, will ultimately prove to be another example of the government scaring the public about something drastic that does not end up happening. \u201cThis is government hype to the umpteenth degree,\u201d AnnMarie Blodgett wrote in our Facebook discussion.  \u201cEverything gets a name these days.  None of it matters.\u201d \u201cI want to ban the phrase \u2018fiscal cliff,\u2019\u201d added Monica Rodriguez.  \u201cThere are other things happening in the world.\u201d But Dolores Casillas, who weighed in on Twitter, said she is very concerned about what may lie ahead. The 27-year-old is out of work and has already cut back expenses. \u201cI was on a phone contract but since it is too expensive now I go prepaid. I always look for deals on everything and I bargain,\u201d she says. Now, with the \u201ccliff\u201d getting closer and closer, Casillas says she\u2019s considering dropping something many Americans can\u2019t imagine living without: coffee. \u201cBut it\u2019s hard when you need it to keep you up,\u201d she adds.

NEW: Besse Cooper was one of the first women to vote in Georgia, helped sign others up to cast ballots Cooper lived in Monroe, Georgia, and her son says she died peacefully She once said she lived so long because she watched what she ate and didn't cause trouble Only eight people have ever been documented to have lived to age 116 Before women gained the right to vote in 1920, Besse Cooper joined the suffrage movement. Then 24, the Georgia school teacher registered women to vote and spoke to others about the importance of having a voice in politics. Cooper voted in every election after the 19th Amendment was passed, save for two. She died Tuesday, at age 116, only one of eight people recognized by the Guinness World Records to have lived that long. Her son Sidney said his mother had her hair done Tuesday morning by a stylist at the assisted-living center where she had lived for the past 11 years but began to have trouble breathing. She died later in her room, peacefully, he said. When asked for her secret to a long life, Cooper told the Guinness website earlier this year: \u201cI mind my own business. And I don\u2019t eat junk food.\u201d Sidney Cooper, 77, said his mother was a strong, determined woman who, like the school teacher she was, could be a disciplinarian. She was fair and honest, he said, but \u201cwhen she said something needed to be done, you\u2019d better do it.\u201d Besse Cooper was born in Sullivan County, Tennessee, on August 26, 1896. She began to go to school at age 5 \u2013 yes, she walked from a log cabin \u2013 to make sure one of her brothers attended. She grew to love going to class and eventually went to East Tennessee Normal School (now East Tennessee State University) in Johnson City to study education. When she graduated, she got a job earning $35 a month. When she heard from a friend she could make more in Georgia, she got a job in Monroe making twice as much. She married Luther Cooper in 1924, and he died in 1963. She never remarried. Sidney Cooper said his mother always said her best years were when she was in her 80s. He will always remember her with her straw hat on, working in the flower garden, scratching weeds away with her hoe. She always had fresh-cut flowers in her home, and in her later years, her family would bring some to her room. She also loved to watch the news on television, her son said. \u201cShe was very intelligent,\u201d Sidney Cooper said. \u201cShe loved to read.\u201d Her eyesight had deteriorated, though, and she no longer read the Bible or any of the great works of fiction. Aside from a few heart issues, she was in \u201camazing\u201d health, her son said, adding that she never complained of pain even in her final days. Besse Cooper gained the distinction of being oldest living human from Guinness World Records in January 2011. She briefly moved to second on the list when the record keepers found a woman in Brazil who was 48 days older, but Maria Gomes Valentim died in June 2011, just weeks before her 115th birthday. The oldest person to have ever lived, according to Guinness World Records, was Jeanne Louise Calment. She died in southern France in 1997 at the age of 122. As for her voting record, Besse Cooper didn\u2019t vote this year. Neither she nor her husband voted in 1948. They thought Thomas Dewey was a shoo-in. Besse Cooper is survived by four children, 11 grandchildren, 13 great-grandchildren and two great-great grandchildren.",

            "article_content": "Illinois Gov. Pat Quinn announced an anti-crime initiative two years ago The nearly $55 million program didn't help to reduce Chicago's soaring murder rate Proponents say it helped get at-risk teens off the streets, part-time jobs Critics say it used taxpayer money to provide welfare, curry votes On a chilly afternoon this fall, teenagers across Chicago\u2019s South Side were busy at work, earning $8.75 an hour to hand out fliers with a message of non-violence. \u201cOur message that we\u2019re giving out today is about being healthy,\u201d said 18-year-old Lucia Eloisa.  \u201cOne of the key pointers is about taking time to reflect and seek inner peace.\u201d Eloisa\u2019s part-time job was paid for by an ambitious state-funded program to keep at-risk teenagers out of trouble.  It pumped nearly $55 million into Chicago\u2019s toughest neighborhoods and three of its suburbs to stem unrelenting gang violence. A four-month CNN investigation found that not only did the Neighborhood Recovery Initiative (NRI) pay teens to hand out fliers promoting inner peace, it also paid these at-risk teens to take field trips to museums, march in a parade with the governor, and even attend a yoga class to learn how to handle stress. Earlier this year, state legislators passed a resolution demanding the state conduct an audit on the program. That audit is under way. Supporters say the program kept kids off the streets of Chicago\u2019s most dangerous neighborhoods and helped expose inner city youth to a broader culture, as well as cultivate future leaders. But critics wonder if it was just a waste of taxpayers\u2019 money, considering that the city\u2019s murder rate has risen since the program began two years ago. Or worse: was it just an effort to buy votes ahead of a tight race for governor? Stemming crime or gaining votes? Pat Quinn became Illinois\u2019 governor in 2009 in the wake of a corruption scandal that took down his predecessor, Rod Blagojevich.  After serving out the rest of Blagojevich\u2019s term, the former lieutenant governor narrowly won the Democratic primary to vie for a full term in 2010. Teens work to save Chicago's south side Chicago gang members reflect on violence Family: Teen killed trying to end fight Should Obama get involved in Chicago? Chicago police collect 5,500+ firearms That fall, Quinn faced a tough challenge against his Republican opponent to retain the governor\u2019s seat. In October 2010 \u2013 less than a month before the gubernatorial election \u2013 Quinn announced his Neighborhood Recovery Initiative, which he said would \u201ctake on the root causes of violence\u201d in Chicago and across Illinois by creating \u201cabout 3,000 part time and permanent jobs for young people so they have a positive way to go.\u201d \u201cAnd we mean business,\u201d Quinn said at the October 6 news conference. \u201cWe really understand how important this is.\u201d Quinn\u2019s political opponents have questioned the timing of his announcement. \u201cI mean, we\u2019re in a budget crisis,\u201d said Illinois state Sen. Matt Murphy, spokesman for the Republican state appropriations committee. \u201cWe were back then. We have since been in a violence crisis in Chicago, and you look at this, and you say for political purposes, you\u2019re taking precious and limited taxpayer dollars and spending them on political purposes rather than solving the violence problem in the city of Chicago. And it was wrong.\u201d Murphy believes that Quinn\u2019s real motivation for implementing the program was to secure votes in Chicago\u2019s heavily Democratic districts on the South Side. Just days before Quinn publicly unveiled the Neighborhood Recovery Initiative, the state agency that would oversee the program expressed concern about how it would be funded. \u201cThere was discussion regarding the payment for this initiative, as the state is already late on payment of existing bills to community-based agencies with state contracts,\u201d according to the minutes of the Illinois Violence Prevention Authority\u2019s September 30, 2010, meeting, which were obtained by CNN. At the meeting, an official from Quinn\u2019s administration assured state officials that the program would have the necessary funds. \u201cThe governor\u2019s office is committed to allocating some of the funds for this initiative immediately and will allocate the rest after the election,\u201d the official said, according to the meeting\u2019s minutes. Murphy called that statement a \u201csmoking gun.\u201d  It shows, according to Murphy, \u201cthat motivation for this program was to get money out in politically important neighborhoods for Gov. Quinn before \u2026 a tight election.\u201d Murphy and other Republican legislators point to the fact that most of the program\u2019s funding went to black neighborhoods in Chicago that were ultimately critical to Quinn\u2019s election. \u201cWhy on earth would anybody in a government position talk about the timing of an election with the release of public taxpayer dollars if it wasn\u2019t for the political advancement of their boss?\u201d Murphy said, referring to the Quinn staffer\u2019s comments. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s buying votes,\u201d said Democratic state Rep. Thaddeus Jones, when asked about the timing of the governor\u2019s announcement of the anti-violence program.  \u201cI could see (it as) currying favor.\u201d Quinn ended up winning the 2010 election by less than one percentage point, largely due to the turnout of the black vote in Chicago. \u2018A lot of baloney\u2019 The Illinois governor strongly denied there was any political motivation behind the Neighborhood Recovery Initiative. \u201cThat\u2019s a lot of baloney, and you know they know that,\u201d Quinn told CNN last month.  \u201cAs a matter of fact, the people making those charges were all running against me. It\u2019s all politics.\u201d Quinn insisted that the initiative was a direct response to the incessant violence that gripped Chicago during the summer of 2010. \u201cThe bottom line is, I went to the funerals of three police officers in 2010,\u201d Quinn said.  \u201cI spoke at all three of those funerals. Gang-bangers had shot down those officers.\u201d Quinn said he formed an anti-violence commission \u2013 which included Chicago residents who had lost loved ones to violence \u2013 that made recommendations that led to the Neighborhood Recovery Initiative. \u201cThat commission recommended having youth programs, opportunities for mentorship and jobs to keep young people away from the gangs,\u201d Quinn said. \u201cI followed their advice and we\u2019ve followed that all the way through. And this is not political. It\u2019s designed to help everyday people stay away from violence, protect their safety, make sure their young children, especially in poor neighborhoods that have no jobs, have a better way.\u201d But records obtained by CNN show the NRI program was under way before those recommendations were released. After a series of open meetings in Chicago and other areas, the commission issued a list of recommendations on September 13, 2010, according to the commission\u2019s chair, Teresa Garate.  Those recommendations \u2013 like the program itself \u2013 focused on four areas: counseling and alternative education, prisoner re-entry, job creation and community development. But a week before those recommendations were issued, Chicago aldermen began receiving a letter from the Illinois Violence Prevention Authority\u2019s (IVPA) director about the NRI program.   The September 7, 2010, letter stated that \u201cthe initiative is on a very fast track, so we are requesting that you respond immediately to this request.\u201d The IVPA is the state agency that oversaw the NRI. When asked about those records, a Quinn spokesman confirmed that the program was in the works before the commission issued its recommendations. What the program actually did Politically motivated or not, it\u2019s hard to argue that the nearly $55 million spent on the Neighborhood Recovery Initiative helped stem violence in Chicago.  Two years after the program was implemented, there have been 476 murders in the city, a nearly 20 percent increase over 2011. Obama walks in his Chicago neighborhood Chicago looks for answers after 40 shot 40 shot, 10 dead after holiday weekend Emanuel: We have a gang problem The governor defended the program, saying that he had to do something to address the situation. \u201cYou take it one year at a time and you try to evaluate the programs, and find out what is working and what isn\u2019t working so well,\u201d Quinn told CNN.  \u201cAnd you focus on the things that work well. But you don\u2019t just say we\u2019re not going to do anything.\u201d The program was set up so quickly that there was no formal way to measure its results, according to hundreds of documents reviewed by CNN and interviews with those who participated in the program. Records provided to CNN show that $54.5 million was spent on the NRI program, mostly through the governor\u2019s discretionary fund, which doesn\u2019t require legislative approval. The only data on the program\u2019s accomplishments come directly from the Illinois Violence Prevention Authority.  The NRI states that it created more than 3,484 jobs, provided counseling for more than 3,100 children, and helped 1,175 ex-cons. The NRI\u2019s self-reported results are being examined by researchers from the University of Illinois at Chicago. No formal report has been issued. CNN reviewed hundreds of documents related to the program and conducted dozens of interviews with program participants which show how some of the money was spent: NRI participants were paid $8.75 an hour, first to receive mentoring from adults, and then go out to pitch positive messages and hand out fliers in their neighborhoods. Lazaro Vasquez, 18, said although he couldn\u2019t explain how the message in the fliers he was handing out would help stop violence, he supported the program. \u201cI just know that I\u2019m trying to do my best that I can (to) pitch that message to youth, and let them know that we\u2019re trying to help the community,\u201d he said. In another instance, students earned $8.75 an hour to visit the DuSable Museum of African American History and to the National Museum of Mexican Art. \u201cIt was an effort to expose the students to a broader perspective on the cultures in their neighborhood and provoke some discussion,\u201d explained Dan Valliere, executive director of Chicago Commons, one of the lead agencies under the Neighborhood Recovery Initiative. \u201cThe goal is to shift youth attitudes and help them develop a perspective on how they can be leaders and impact their neighborhood in a positive way.  Over time, this kind of work can help reduce violence.  There is research and experience to back that up.\u201d Students were also paid to attend a yoga class as part of the program\u2019s effort \u201cto point them out of their comfort zone \u2026 think differently and become more a leader in their own neighborhood,\u201d Valliere explained. It does work when you intervene, when you keep people on a positive path .. instead of getting involved with gang-bangers and drug dealers. Illinois Gov. Pat Quinn The NRI also paid teens from the Better Boys Foundation to march in the 82nd Annual Bud Billiken Parade on August 13, 2011, with Quinn, according to records and video of the parade. \u201cTheir job was promoting positive messages, etc., which is what the parade is about,\u201d a spokesman for Quinn said. An audit of one of the Neighborhood Recovery Initiative\u2019s lead groups \u2013 The Woodlawn Organization \u2013 uncovered a \u201clack of clear accounting and record keeping\u201d and \u201cquestionable decisions.\u201d  The group, which has a two-year contract, received $1.2 million before the state de-funded it. According to the audit \u2013 which is separate from the ongoing state audit of the entire NRI program \u2013 The Woodlawn Organization used the money to buy $2,000 in American Express gift cards for two employees working for one of its subcontractors. The two staff members \u201chad to work far more hours over the course of the program than they were paid to do,\u201d said Joel Hamernick, director of the subcontractor, Sunshine Gospel Ministries. Hamernick told CNN that his group got permission from The Woodlawn Organization \u201cto make these two gift cards available to this staff in order to show our appreciation for their hard work.\u201d Georgette Greenlee-Finney, the former executive director of The Woodlawn Organization, did not return repeated phone calls from CNN.  James Taylor, attorney for The Woodlawn Organization, said the group would provide all documentation requested by the state for its audit of the NRI. Illinois legislators, like Sen. Murphy, have been demanding specifics about whether the Neighborhood Recovery Initiative delivered on its promises. \u201cAt first blush, this appears to have been a misuse of taxpayer dollars,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been asking for answers \u2026 on where this money was spent, how it was spent. You know, this is state taxpayer money.\u201d It\u2019s not only Republican legislators who have asked for more specifics about the NRI. Rep. Jones sent a letter in August to the state agency overseeing the program asking for a \u201clist of administration costs\u201d associated with NRI and a list of groups that have submitted audits. The letter was sent in August to Barbara Shaw, the former director of the Illinois Violence Prevention Authority, who has since retired from state government. Jones said he never received a response. \u201cThere still needs to be some examination of where the money went,\u201d Jones said.  \u201cIf the money didn\u2019t go to the anti-violence programs, I\u2019m not going to let it rest on deaf ears.\u201d Mixed results Examples of the apparent misuse of the program\u2019s money don\u2019t surprise Mike Shaver, whose organization, Chicago Children\u2019s Home and Aid, received $2.1 million for its role as a lead agency for the Neighborhood Recovery Initiative. He and others say the initiative was just too big, and providers were not equipped to evaluate which programs were working and which were not. \u201cWe weren\u2019t able to get enough information about what was going on in our own program to understand whether we were having the desired impact,\u201d said Shaver. Others involved with the Chicago anti-violence initiative underscored the successes of the program \u2013 like keeping kids off the streets \u2013 while acknowledging more needs to be done. \u201cWe engage with the kids and things of that nature, do booster training and get them life skills and coping skills,\u201d said Lamont Coakley, an adult mentor.  \u201cIt\u2019s just limited on the funds.  If we can get funded to hire all the youth, then it would work. \u201cBecause if we really look at it, when they\u2019re at their training, when they\u2019re at work, they\u2019re not shooting anyone.\u201d Father Michael Pfleger, of the Church of St. Sabina \u2013 another of the NRI\u2019s lead agencies \u2013 said the program\u2019s overall success shouldn\u2019t just be measured by Chicago\u2019s crime rate. \u201cLet\u2019s not say because the NRI can\u2019t show evidence of crime being down that it\u2019s failed,\u201d Pfleger said.  \u201cNo, I look at the NRI with the boots on the street and within the community that we\u2019re helping from getting worse.\u201d You\u2019re not giving young people a chance to advance by giving them this flier-passing-out job. Illinois state Sen. Matt Murphy That sentiment was echoed by the Illinois governor: \u201cIt does work when you intervene, when you keep people on a positive path, doing good things for their community instead of getting involved with gang-bangers and drug dealers that afflict many communities, and use violence to kill children in particular,\u201d Quinn said. \u201cMost people who have looked at this issue, who are experts, say the best way to fight the violence is to have after-school programs for children who can get in trouble after school, have programs of mentoring so they have positive role models, have programs where they can have a job, even if it\u2019s just a part-time job, a seasonable job.\u201d But Murphy said those temporary jobs are just \u201canother way of providing welfare.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019re not giving young people a chance to advance by giving them this flier-passing-out job,\u201d Murphy said.  \u201cYou\u2019re not creating an environment where job growth that is lasting is going to take hold.\u201d Today, the Neighborhood Recovery Initiative has been scaled back, with a much smaller budget of just $15 million.  It\u2019s also being managed by a different state agency. And the jobs?  A spokeswoman for the Illinois Criminal Justice Information Authority said that\u2019s being reworked to put \u201cyouth in more traditional employment and mentoring situations.\u201d CNN\u2019s Sara Anwar contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Gabrielle Giffords is joined by her husband, Mark Kelly She  thanks the cheering crowd, but does not say much Her former aide, Ron Barber, is running for the seat she resigned from Giffords was with Barber, who was wounded during the January 2011 assassination attempt Former Democratic Congresswoman Gabrielle Giffords made a rare appearance before a cheering crowd of supporters at a \u201cGet out the vote\u201d concert in downtown Tucson. Giffords was joined by her husband, Mark Kelly, at the Saturday event for a special election race for the seat from which she resigned. The standing-room only crowd gathered at a theater cheered as she walked on stage with her husband, who spoke on her behalf. \u201cIt was incredibly hard for her to resign,\u201d Kelly said as Giffords smiled and held hands with her former aide Ron Barber. \u201cAnd the person she knew could represent this district like she did is standing to my left.\u201d After her husband\u2019s speech that drew loud cheers, Giffords said, \u201cThank you very much.\u201d Giffords was with Barber, who was wounded during the January 2011 assassination attempt that nearly took her life. Now he\u2019s running for her seat. Gabrielle Giffords says goodbye Ron Barber: Honoring Giffords' legacy The race to fill her seat has become a nail-biter in a district where Republicans have a 6% advantage in registered voters. \u201cA lot of volunteers, including myself were working today in 100 degree heat,\u201d said Jeff Rogers, chairman of the Pima County  Democratic Party. They went door-to-door,  reminding voters of the special election Tuesday. \u201cWe\u2019re seeing an awful lot of interest for a special election in the middle of summer,\u201d he said. Neither campaign is releasing any polling data that suggest any lead would be within the margin of error. In 2010, a year dominated by tea party sentiment, Giffords won re-election by a few thousand votes. She beat Republican Jesse Kelly,  who is hoping to win the seat this time around. \u201cThe next 72 hours, what we put into it, we\u2019ll get out.  It\u2019s a razor-thin margin,\u201d Kelly, a former marine, told supporters at a Republican volunteer phone bank.  \u201cYou think last time was close, 4,000 votes?  They say this one will be in the hundreds. We gotta work the phones.\u201d Both campaigns centered around jobs and the economy, with the Republican candidate taking a national approach. Kelly has made defeating President Barack Obama part of his message. \u201cHe\u2019s gonna win this race for us because this nation is tired of his job killing agenda and they [voters] know that I will go to Washington and fight him,\u201d he said. Barber, a moderate Democrat, says he supports the president, but he\u2019s crafted a local message of helping the middle class in southern Arizona. \u201cMiddle class Americans feel they\u2019re being squeezed by stagnant wages, underemployment and foreclosures,\u201d  Barber said. \u201cWe need to send someone to Congress who is listening to the people and that\u2019s what I\u2019ve been doing.\u201d The race has attracted interest and money from outside the district. Super Pacs are at work on both sides, and the Republican National Congressional Committee as well as the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee have ran ads here. Whoever wins the seat Tuesday will hold it for only six months and will start running for re-election almost immediately. That\u2019s because come Fall, district lines in the state will move slightly and will become more amenable to Democrats, though still competitive. Winning the special election matters, says Kate Kinski, who teaches government and communications at the University of Arizona. \u201cDemocrats don\u2019t want to lose and Republicans want to ensure that come Fall, and they won\u2019t quite have those margins that they have now,  that they still have an opportunity to try to win this (new)  district,\u201d she said. Giffords resigned her seat as she was undergoing rehabilitation after the attack that left left six people dead last year. Her resignation prompted the special election to choose a successor for the remainder of her term in Arizona\u2019s 8th District.",

            "article_content": "Once a Democratic star, John Edwards fell from grace after an affair His trial on campaign finance charges wrapped up Thursday Edwards' affair with a campaign videographer ended his political career The former vice presidential candidate once had his eyes on the White House The acquittal and mistrial in John Edwards\u2019 campaign finance fraud trial completes a fall from grace that transformed the man who might have been president into one of the most vilified and lampooned political figures in the country. Opinion: Edwards jury got it exactly right The boyish-looking, smooth-talking lawyer and self-described \u201cson of a millworker\u201d was once known for rallying supporters with a populist mantra describing two Americas \u2013 the haves and have-nots. Now he is best known for fathering a child in an extramarital affair while his wife Elizabeth battled incurable cancer and, according to prosecutors, scheming to use wealthy donors\u2019 money to help him cover up his affair and hide his mistress from the public. WTVD: Juror had no intention of flirting with Edwards It was all so different five years ago, when Edwards could be heard preaching his populist prose to Iowa voters who eagerly packed into lumber barns, Veterans of Foreign Wars halls and restaurants across the state. Photos: The rise and fall of John Edwards Reporter: Edwards knew he'd be OK Will prosecutors retry John Edwards? Edwards takes full responsibility? Inside the John Edwards Trial He had every reason to believe he could be president. He felt the country would let Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama, both senators at the time with presidential ambitions of their own, destroy each other with negative campaigning. John Edwards: Once a cheater, always a cheater? And if the country wasn\u2019t ready to elect a black man or a woman president, he would rise as the more experienced and safe nominee. To many voters, Edwards was a fitting candidate to live in the White House and serve as president. Instead, Edwards appeared in front of TV cameras Thursday and took responsibility for \u201cmy sins\u201d after his federal corruption case ended in an acquittal and mistrial. Prosecutors had accused Edwards of using almost $1 million in illegal campaign contributions to keep his pregnant mistress under wraps. But after more than 50 hours of deliberations, jurors cleared him of one of six counts and deadlocked on the rest. Why politicians lie Edwards, who turns 59 on June 10, argued that while his actions were wrong, they were not illegal. Emerging from the courthouse with his parents and daughter at his side, he said that while he never believed he committed a crime, \u201cI did an awful, awful lot that was wrong, and there is no one else responsible for my sins.\u201d Now a widower, he is the sole caregiver to his two youngest children by his late wife \u2013 Emma Claire, 13, and Jack, 11. The couple also raised two older children. Their son, Wade, died at age 16 in a 1996 road accident. Daughter Cate Edwards Upham attended every day of her father\u2019s four-week trial, sitting behind Edwards and next to her grandparents. Edwards charges: The rundown Edwards also provides financial support for his daughter with Rielle Hunter, his mistress from the campaign trail during his unsuccessful bid for the Democratic presidential nomination in the 2008 election. A product of a working class family from South Carolina, Edwards got a law degree from the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill in 1977. He became a successful trial lawyer representing claimants against large corporations and insurance companies. He won his first, and only major, political race in 1998, unseating a Republican incumbent to become a U.S. senator from North Carolina. John Edwards' jury coordinates outfits Edwards trial ends in hung jury Edwards: \"I did a lot that was wrong' 2008: John Edwards admits affair As a senator, Edwards reportedly made it onto a list of potential running mates for Al Gore in the 2000 presidential election. He didn\u2019t make the ticket that time. But before his first term ended, he was running for president and ended up as Sen. John Kerry\u2019s running mate in 2004. Kerry lost to incumbent President George W. Bush. Once running mates, Kerry and Edwards quickly severed their friendship after what was a disappointing election for Edwards. He quickly set his sights on Iowa, gearing up for another presidential bid in 2008. Edwards met Hunter in early 2006 at a bar at the Regency Hotel in New York City. Hunter approached Edwards, not believing it was him. Later that evening, Edwards and Hunter met again, privately. Overheard on CNN.com: \u2018Being a slimy dirtbag doesn\u2019t equal being a criminal\u2019 The man who constantly spoke about two Americas began living two lives. The 40-something Hunter told Edwards that she could help his campaign. Edwards hired her to produce a few videos that would present the politician in a more relaxed manner. The videos were called \u201cwebisodes\u201d and were posted to Edwards\u2019 campaign site. However, instead of showing Edwards in a new light, the flirtatious on-camera banter only highlighted just how close Edwards and Hunter had become. Staffers began to suspect that Hunter had become more than a videographer to Edwards. That thought was fueled by Edwards\u2019 directive that Hunter be allowed to travel with him whenever either of them insisted. Josh Brumberger was Edwards\u2019 chief of staff during the time Hunter traveled with the campaign. On several occasions, he talked to Edwards about Hunter\u2019s involvement with the campaign. One heated altercation ended with Edwards firing Brumberger, and by the fall of 2006, several longtime senior aides left the campaign amid Edwards\u2019 refusal to end his relationship with Hunter, as detailed in \u201cGame Change,\u201d the book about the 2008 election. On December 28, 2006, Edwards launched his presidential campaign in New Orleans against the backdrop of a city trying to rebuild and revive itself. He vowed to strengthen the middle class, progressively end poverty and tackle the longstanding Democratic health care platform. But just as the campaign got off the ground, it hit turbulence. In March 2007, Elizabeth Edwards announced she had breast cancer for the second time, and it was incurable. Still, they decided to continue with the campaign. And in the weeks after the devastating discovery, internal campaign polling showed Edwards surging ahead of rivals Clinton and Obama in Iowa. Meanwhile, Hunter had become pregnant. And to complicate things, Edwards was swimming in a pool of bad press \u2013 he had received $400 haircuts and had made a six-figure salary working for a hedge fund that was linked to subprime lending and foreclosed homes. Enter Rachel \u201cBunny\u201d Mellon. The wealthy banking heiress and widow who was once a close friend of Jacqueline Kennedy had been a supporter of Edwards since the 2004 election. After already contributing to Edwards the maximum allowed by law, Mellon provided additional money. According to court documents, between June 2007 and January 2008, Mellon allegedly wrote personal checks payable to a friend, hiding that she was giving money to Edwards. The checks were made out to the wife of Edwards aide Andrew Young, in her maiden name, and were deposited into accounts controlled by her and Young. As Edwards and Young planned, Young allegedly used the money to provide Hunter with rent, furniture, care, living expenses, medical visits and prenatal care. In total, the now 101-year-old Mellon gave Edwards seven checks ranging from $10,000 to $200,000. On October 10, 2007, the National Enquirer ran its first story saying Edwards was having an affair. The next day while campaigning in Summerton, South Carolina, Edwards denied the report, calling it \u201ctabloid trash.\u201d With tabloid reporters and photographers chasing Hunter and publishing photos of her pregnant, a second wealthy donor came forward. Fred Baron, a wealthy Texas lawyer who is now deceased, was the national finance chair of the campaign. Court documents show that from December 2007 to January 2008, Baron allegedly wrote nine checks ranging from $9,000 to $58,000. The money was used for Young to hide a pregnant Hunter from the media, as he falsely claimed paternity for her child. Baron\u2019s money was used to charter a private jet for trips to Fort Lauderdale, Florida; Aspen, Colorado; San Diego and Santa Barbara, California. Things weren\u2019t faring better for Edwards on the campaign trail. He placed second in the Iowa caucuses, and following disappointing losses in New Hampshire and South Carolina, he ended his campaign for president on January 30, 2008. Amid rumors in Democratic circles that he was secretly trying to broker a deal for vice president or attorney general in a Clinton or Obama administration, reporters remained persistent and continued to ask Edwards if he was having an affair. In February 2008, Hunter\u2019s and Edwards\u2019 child was born. Six months later, after repeated denials, Edwards admitted he had an affair with Hunter in an August 8 interview with ABC. When asked in the interview if he was the father of Hunter\u2019s child, he responded, \u201cThat is absolutely not true.\u201d While his name was not on the birth certificate, Edwards would eventually claim paternity and apologize for denying the baby was his child. In February 2009, the U.S. Department of Justice acknowledged they had opened an investigation on Edwards regarding campaign finances. By this point, his more than 30-year marriage was falling apart. John and Elizabeth separated and lived apart until Elizabeth Edwards succumbed to breast cancer weeks before Christmas in 2010, with Edwards and their oldest daughter, Cate, at her bedside. For Edwards, life got worse. After testimony from a cast of former staffers, including Hunter and Young \u2013 the latter having published a scandalous tell-all book \u2013 a grand jury indicted Edwards on June 3, 2011. Edwards refused a plea bargain that would have given him a few months in prison but would have allowed him to keep his law license.",

            "article_content": "By Lester Spence, Special to CNN Editor\u2019s Note:  Lester K. Spence is an Assistant Professor of Political Science and Africana Studies at Johns Hopkins University. His first book \n            \n                Stare in the Darkness: The Limits of Hip-hop and Black Politics was published in June 2011, and was one of the first books to empirically examine the political effect of hip-hop on black communities. While in my office, preparing for the new semester, I had the opportunity to watch the president\u2019s speech on college affordability delivered at the University of Michigan. I was interested in the speech in part because I am a political scientist, in part because I am a college professor, and in part because I am an alumnus of the University of Michigan. But most importantly I was interested in the speech because my oldest daughter will be leaving for college in just seven short months. And although being a Johns Hopkins college professor has its benefits (Hopkins gives a generous tuition benefit applicable to any college in the nation) I still worry about my daughter and her four younger brothers and sisters. In his speech President Obama focused on three components designed to ease the burden of middle-class families\u2014reducing interest on college student loans, maintaining the tuition tax credit, and creating incentives to make universities lower their costs. Now I understand for some politics is the art of the possible. He proposes these things knowing that as hard as it will be to pass them legislatively, these things are at least possible to get past both houses of Congress. (It isn\u2019t likely, particularly during an election year, but it\u2019s possible.) But for me, politics isn\u2019t just about the art of the possible\u2014about what we can pass in the here and now. Politics is about expanding and extending that art, about pushing the borders to create space for even more change in the future. How can we do that here? What if, instead of proposing policies geared towards individual middle-class tax-payers that revolved around the assumption that higher education was an individual\u2019s responsibility, the president instead proposed policies geared towards embedding higher education as an individual right. What if, instead of getting a tax write-off after you\u2019ve already paid your son/daughter\u2019s tuition, you instead didn\u2019t have to worry about education because the government would pay for it? It\u2019s socialism! It\u2019s too expensive! I want to take the socialism critique first. The reality is that even here we routinely spend a significant amount of our government\u2019s resources on subsidies, on what tea party supporters might call \u201csocialist policies.\u201d For instance, in 2009 the government spent almost $86 billion on home ownership subsidies in the form of the mortgage interest deduction, subsidizing the home purchases of almost 35 million citizens. In 2010 the government spent almost $104 billion. Furthermore, as the president noted in the State of the Union address, the federal government routinely spends billions of dollars in corporate subsidies, helping them research and develop new products, helping them build new plants, helping them train new workers. If we wouldn\u2019t think of these policies as socialist, why should we necessarily consider a policy to pay for college tuition socialist? The second critique is a bit more thoughtful. If tuition and fees are too expensive for parents, wouldn\u2019t placing this burden on the government be exorbitantly expensive, too expensive to even consider? As of 2004 it would have cost approximately $30 billion to pay for the tuition and fees of everyone currently attending a public college, whether that college be four-year like the University of Michigan, or two-year, like neighboring Washtenaw Community College. Even if we double that figure now due to inflation, we\u2019re still talking about spending less money on college tuition for every student able to get into college, than we routinely do to subsidize home purchases. Such a policy for me is a no-brainer. It significantly reduces the financial burden on parents and on students. No longer would a father and mother have to consider taking a second mortgage on their home or perhaps a second job to put their child through school. No longer would three college roommates have to have eight jobs between them (as my roommates and myself did in 1990). President Obama didn\u2019t mention working class or poor parents at all \u2013 no longer would college be out of reach for much of the 99%. This policy is politically impossible in the current climate. But then again, so was Social Security at one point. So was the GI Bill. So was the Civil Rights Act. If we can\u2019t even talk about such a policy as a possibility aloud now, then when? The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Lester Spence.",

            "article_content": "As the fiscal cliff looms, what\u2019s your New Year\u2019s message to Washington? Go to CNNiReport to share your video. NEW: \"We've been in discussions all day and they continue,\" Sen. McConnell says McConnell and Harry Reid should update their caucuses, perhaps with an agreement, on Sunday There will be major cuts and widespread tax increases without a deal by year's end Some congressmen say Americans have a right to be frustrated by the stalemate The Senate\u2019s top Democrat and Republican are working this weekend to forge a compromise to prevent the country from going over the fiscal cliff, the combination of sweeping spending cuts and widespread tax increases that will otherwise take effect in days. By mid-day Saturday, Senate aides from both parties reported no major developments in the talks. That may not be a bad sign, as a Democratic aide earlier said his side would probably leak a Republican offer it considers \u201claughable\u201d but would keep it private if the proposals were reasonable. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell did tell reporters early Saturday evening, \u201cWe\u2019ve been trading paper all day, and the talks continue into the evening.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve been in discussions all day and they continue,\u201d the Kentucky Republican said. \u201cWe\u2019ll let you know as soon as we have some news to make.\u201d Hopes of fiscal cliff deal dwindling Five days until fiscal cliff Reid: Boehner running  'dictatorship' The making of the fiscal cliff problem The Senate aides said they expect no details will be divulged until Sunday afternoon, when McConnell and Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada,  will update their Republican and Democratic caucuses, respectively. House Republicans will get together sometime early Sunday night, according to a note sent to legislators and staffers. House Speaker John Boehner has called on the Senate to go first, and then his chamber \u2013 which reconvenes Sunday \u2013 will act. Early Friday evening after a meeting involving President Obama, congressional leaders and top administration officials, the president said he was \u201cmodestly optimistic\u201d the Senate leaders would reach an agreement. At the same time, he conceded, \u201cNobody\u2019s going to get 100% of what they want.\u201d The weekend talks are being led by the two senators\u2019 chiefs of staff \u2013 David Krone for Reid, and Sharron Soderstrom for McConnell \u2013 communicating largely over the phone and by e-mail, aides said. Staffers for Boehner, the top man in the Republican-led House of Representatives, won\u2019t directly take part in the negotiations, but they\u2019ll be kept informed by McConnell\u2019s staff, a GOP aide said. From the White House, Obama has been in close contact with negotiators, a senior administration official said Saturday. Democrats believe Republicans should make the \u201cfirst move\u201d \u2013 basically by saying how they want to alter the president\u2019s proposal, which calls for tax rates to stay the same for all annual family income below $250,000. The expectation is Republicans will try to raise that income threshold to $400,000 and push to keep estate taxes low; Democrats said they might be open to one such scenario, but not both. If the two sides don\u2019t agree on a bill over the weekend, Obama said he wants his latest proposal to be put up for a vote in both the Senate and House. He predicted his plan \u2013 which, in addition to his tax rate proposal, would extend unemployment benefits and \u201clay the groundwork\u201d for deficit reduction \u2013 would pass in both chambers with bipartisan support. As members of Congress and their staffs talk, Obama will make his case to the public by appearing Sunday on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d his first appearance on a Sunday political talk show in three years. The appearance follows his weekly radio address, given Saturday, in which he said it was Republicans\u2019 \u201cprerogative\u201d to \u201clet this tax hike hit the middle class,\u201d while Republican Sen. Roy Blunt of Missouri countered by accusing Democrats of spending \u201cmonths drawing partisan lines in the sand.\u201d Reid said, at the very least, that he\u2019d prepare legislation that includes elements favored by Obama for a vote by Monday. Still, he insisted he\u2019d first work with his GOP colleagues. \u201cI look forward to hearing any good-faith proposals Sen. McConnell has for altering this bill,\u201d the Nevada Democrat said. If no legislation passes both chambers and therefore isn\u2019t signed by the president by year\u2019s end, the fiscal cliff will go into effect \u2013 something economists warn could trigger a recession. Why both sides want to go over the cliff McConnell: We are 'staring at a crisis' Scaled-back deal key to finding fix? The lack of political movement thus far, and lack of confidence Washington politicians can get anything done with so little time left, has spurred consumer confidence to sag and stock market values to sink. Some, like Democratic Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York, expressed cautious optimism Friday that the looming deadline, and the key players renewed engagement, would spur a deal. But others were less optimistic, with Democratic Rep. Jim Moran of Virginia saying Saturday that \u201cI don\u2019t think we are going to be able to reach a deal, no matter how small it might be.\u201d Republican Sen. Bob Corker of Tennessee derided the entire process so far as \u201ca total dereliction of duty on every level.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve been very surprised that the president has not laid out a very specific plan to deal with this,\u201d he said on CBS \u201cThis Morning.\u201d \u201cBut candidly, Congress should have done the same. And I think the American people should be disgusted.\u201d The principal dispute continues to be over taxes, specifically Democrats\u2019 demand to extend most tax cuts passed under President George W. Bush while allowing higher rates of the 1990s to return on top income brackets. During his re-election campaign, Obama said doing so would protect 98% of Americans and 97% of small businesses from tax hikes. Republicans have opposed any increase in tax rates, and Boehner suffered the political indignity last week of offering a compromise \u2013 a $1 million threshold for the higher rates to kick in \u2013 that his GOP colleagues refused to support because it raised taxes and had no chance of passing the Senate. Obama and Democrats have leverage, based on the president\u2019s re-election last month and Democrats\u2019 gains in the House and Senate in the new Congress. In addition, polls consistently show majority support for Obama\u2019s position on taxes, and Democrats insist the House would pass the president\u2019s plan with Democrats joined by some Republicans if Boehner allowed a vote on it. However, conservative activist Grover Norquist has vowed to back primary challenges against Republicans who violate his widely signed pledge not to raise taxes. Even if a deal is reached, Norquist has predicted yet more budget showdowns every time the government needs additional money to operate. The two sides seemingly made progress early last week on forging a $2 trillion deficit reduction deal that included new revenue sought by Obama and spending cuts and entitlement changes desired by Boehner. Boehner appeared to move on increased tax revenue, including higher rates on top income brackets and eliminating deductions and loopholes. But his inability to rally all House Republicans behind his plan raised questions about his role and what comes next. The saga has fueled disdain for politicians by many Americans. Such contempt is deserved, said Rep. Steven LaTourette, an Ohio Republican, who is retiring from Congress. \u201cI think America should be embarrassed by its leadership in D.C.,\u201d he told CNN on Friday. \u201cThe fact that we have been unable to do things, and instead worried about our next elections. \u2026 I think it\u2019s sinful.\u201d What happens to the economy if we go over the cliff?

It almost certainly won\u2019t be the grand bargain sought by President Barack Obama and House Speaker John Boehner that addresses the nation\u2019s chronic federal deficits and debt. It may not happen before January 1, the trigger date for the automatic tax increases on everyone and deep spending cuts of the fiscal cliff.

Ileana Ros-Lehtinen complained Wednesday on CNN, referring to both sides in the debate. \u201cI know the American people are tired of all of us.\u201d Obama is heading back to Washington on Wednesday night from his Hawaiian vacation, leaving behind the first family, to be ready if the Senate comes up with a plan when it returns Thursday from its own Christmas break. Fiscal cliff bill could come down to wire Meanwhile, House Republican leaders held a conference call Wednesday afternoon but made no decision about when to bring their members back to Washington, according to a GOP source on the call. Members were told last week they would receive 48 hours\u2019 notice if they needed to return after Christmas. The principal dispute continues to be over taxes, specifically the demand by Obama and Democrats to extend most of the tax cuts passed under President George W. Bush while allowing higher rates of the 1990s to return on top income brackets. Obama campaigned for re-election on keeping the current lower tax rates on family income up to $250,000, which he argues would protect 98% of Americans and 97% of small businesses from rates that increase on income above that level. Republicans oppose any kind of increase in tax rates, and Boehner suffered the political indignity last week of offering a compromise \u2013 a $1 million threshold for the higher rates to kick in \u2013 that his colleagues refused to support because it raised taxes and had no chance of passing the Democrat-controlled Senate. Rep. Nan Hayworth, R-New York, acknowledged Wednesday that a deal will have to include some form of higher rates on top income brackets, but she said her party would fight to make it as minimal as possible. Going over the cliff: What changes, what doesn\u2019t \u201cIf that\u2019s where people have to go, we\u2019ll make the threshold as high as we can,\u201d Hayworth said on CNN, arguing that higher taxes in any form burden economic growth. \u201cBecause the more relief we provide, the better off we\u2019ll be.\u201d Hayworth also made clear that a limited agreement was the most to expect for now, saying: \u201cI don\u2019t think we\u2019re going to get the big plan in the next six days.\u201d Fiscal deadline: Ball in Senate's court Ribble: We need to 'come together' Rep. Grijalva: It's 'a short fix' A statement Wednesday by Boehner\u2019s leadership team said the Democratic-controlled Senate must act first on proposals already passed by the House but rejected by Senate leaders and Obama. \u201cIf the Senate will not approve and send them to the president to be signed into law in their current form, they must be amended and returned to the House,\u201d the leadership statement said. \u201cOnce this has occurred, the House will then consider whether to accept the bills as amended, or to send them back to the Senate with additional amendments. The House will take this action on whatever the Senate can pass, but the Senate first must act.\u201d Obama and Democrats have leverage, based on the president\u2019s re-election last month and Democratic gains in the House and Senate in the new Congress that will convene in January. In addition, polls consistently show majority support for Obama\u2019s position on taxes. Economists warn that failure to avoid the fiscal cliff could bring a recession, and stocks have been down since the middle of last week, when apparent progress in the talks suddenly unraveled with Boehner proposing his own \u201cPlan B\u201d that was rejected by fellow House Republicans. The Gallup daily tracking poll released Wednesday showed 54% of respondents support Obama\u2019s handling of the fiscal cliff negotiations, compared with 26% who approve of Boehner\u2019s  performance. Starbucks makes political push on fiscal cliff Sen. Harry Reid, the Democratic majority leader in the Senate, had an approval rating of 34% for his role so far. Reid is poised to assume a larger role as the focus of negotiations appears to be shifting to the Senate after last week\u2019s GOP disarray in the House stymied any progress before Christmas. A senior Senate Democratic source told CNN on Wednesday that Reid has made clear in private conversations that he will need assurance any plan can pass both the Senate and the House before he will bring it up. \u201cIt is to nobody\u2019s advantage to have a failed Senate vote at this point,\u201d the source said on condition of not being identified. \u201cThis will be the last train we will have, and there is no sense in it leaving the station before we have assurance it will get through.\u201d Remaining questions include whether enough Republicans will support a compromise acceptable to Democrats, and whether Senate GOP leader Mitch McConnell will allow a simple majority vote to take up and pass any proposal, or stick to the filibuster level of 60%. \u201cWe believe very strongly a reasonable package can get majorities in both houses,\u201d a senior White House official said. \u201cThe only thing that would prevent it is if Senator McConnell and Speaker Boehner don\u2019t cooperate.\u201d Some Senate Democrats have discussed holding off on bringing up a proposal until the final days of 2012 to increase pressure on Republicans to support avoiding higher taxes on everyone due to the fiscal cliff While the focus now is on a possible agreement in coming days or weeks, anti-tax crusader Grover Norquist told CNN earlier this week that the nation should gird for long-range battle. \u201cIt\u2019s four years of a fight. It\u2019s not one week of a fight,\u201d said Norquist, who has threatened to mount primary challenges against Republicans who violate a pledge they signed at his behest against ever voting for a tax increase. While both sides say they want to avoid the fiscal cliff, signs are emerging that a deal would come after the new year to blunt the harshest impacts. Under that scenario, the new Congress convening in early January would vote to lower taxes from the higher rates that will go into effect in January when the Bush cuts expire, with the new top rates staying intact. According to a senior administration official, Obama continues to oppose a Republican call for extending the Bush-era tax cuts for everyone to buy time for working out a broader deficit reduction deal that would include overall tax reform. However, a Senate Republican leadership aide told CNN that Republicans reject Obama\u2019s $250,000 threshold for tax cut extensions. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be here New Year\u2019s Eve,\u201d retiring Sen. Joe Lieberman said Sunday on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union,\u201d adding that it was likely the nation would go over the fiscal cliff. Failing to meet the year-end deadline on striking a deal would amount to \u201cthe most colossal, consequential act of congressional irresponsibility in a long time,\u201d said Lieberman, an independent from Connecticut who caucuses with Democrats. \u201cMaybe ever in American history, because of the impact it will have on almost every American.\u201d However, Norquist called the situation part of a longer process, predicting \u201ca regular fight\u201d when Congress needs to authorize more government spending and raise the federal debt ceiling in coming months. \u201cThere the Republicans have a lot of clout because they can say we\u2019ll let you run the government for the next month, but you\u2019ve got to make these reforms,\u201d he explained. On Wednesday, Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner informed Congress that the government would reach its borrowing limit at the end of the year \u2013 in five days\u2019 time \u2013 but could take steps to create what he called \u201cheadroom\u201d for two months or so. However, Geithner said uncertainty over the fiscal cliff negotiations and possible changes to the deficit situation made it difficult to predict precisely how long the government\u2019s steps to ease the situation would last. Before heading to Hawaii last Friday, Obama called for Congress to come back after Christmas and work with him on a limited agreement to prevent tax hikes on the middle class, extend unemployment insurance and set a framework for future deficit reduction steps. Boehner\u2019s spokesman said the speaker will be \u201cready to find a solution that can pass both houses of Congress\u201d when he returns to Washington, expected to occur on Thursday. The GOP opposition to any kind of tax rate increase has stalled deficit negotiations for two years and led to unusual political drama, such as McConnell recently filibustering a proposal he introduced and Thursday night\u2019s rebuff by House Republicans of the alternative tax plan pushed by Boehner, their leader. Reid and other Senate Democrats say House Republicans must accept that agreement will require support from legislators in both parties, rather than a GOP majority in the House pushing through a measure on its own. He insisted that a Senate-passed plan with Obama\u2019s $250,000 threshold would pass the House if Boehner would allow a vote. However, the Senate proposal is held up on constitutional grounds, because legislation that increases revenue must originate in the House. Boehner and Republicans complain the Senate has refused to take up any proposals they have passed in the past two years. Reid argues that the GOP measures amount to a conservative wish list of unacceptable spending cuts and reforms intended to shrink government and weaken entitlement programs vital to senior citizens, the poor and the disabled. Some House Republicans have said they would join Democrats in supporting the president\u2019s proposal in hopes of moving past the volatile issue to focus on the spending cuts and entitlement reforms they seek. The possibility of a fiscal cliff was set in motion over the past two years as a way to force action on mounting government debt. Now, legislators risk looking politically cynical by seeking to weaken the measures enacted to try to force them to confront tough questions regarding deficit reduction, such as reforms to popular entitlement programs such as Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. The two sides seemingly had made progress early last week on forging a $2 trillion deficit reduction deal that included new revenue sought by Obama and spending cuts and entitlement changes desired by Boehner. Obama\u2019s latest offer set $400,000 as the income threshold for a tax rate increase, up from his original plan of $250,000. It also included a new formula for the consumer price index applied to some entitlement benefits, much to the chagrin of liberals. Called chained CPI, the new formula includes assumptions on consumer habits in response to rising prices, such as seeking cheaper alternatives, and would result in smaller benefit increases in future years. Statistics supplied by opponents say the change would mean Social Security recipients would get $6,000 less in benefits over the first 15 years of chained CPI. Liberal groups sought to mount a pressure campaign against including the chained CPI after news emerged this week that Obama was willing to include it, calling the plan a betrayal of senior citizens who had contributed throughout their lives for their benefits. For his part, Boehner conceded on increased tax revenue, including higher rates on top income brackets and eliminating some deductions and loopholes.

            "article_content": "NEW: President Obama spoke with congressional leaders about a possible deal A Democratic source lays out possible scenarios House Republicans reject Speaker Boehner's tax alternative Everyone's taxes go up in 11 days without an agreement President Barack Obama spoke separately Friday with Speaker John Boehner and the top Senate Democrat to try to salvage a fiscal cliff deal by the end of year, after Republican disarray in the U.S. House put the negotiations in limbo. In a previously unscheduled statement to reporters, Obama outlined a possible agreement that he said would include protecting middle-class Americans from a tax hike, extending unemployment benefits and setting a framework for future deficit reduction steps. He called on Congress to pass the agreement after a Christmas break so he can sign it before the end of the year, when the fiscal cliff arrives in the form of automatic tax increases and deep spending cuts. \u201cLaws can only pass with support from Democrats and Republicans,\u201d Obama said in urging both sides to compromise. Fiscal cliff: What's next? John Boehner's Plan B thrown out Fiscal cliff deal could hit charities Averting the fiscal cliff The president planned to fly with his family to Hawaii on Friday night for the holiday and return to Washington after Christmas, while House and Senate members also headed home with plans to return on December 27 if needed. Boehner\u2019s spokesman said the speaker will be \u201cready to find a solution that can pass both houses of Congress\u201d when he returns to Washington. What failure on fiscal deal means for troubled Boehner While congressional leaders continued to bicker Friday over the next step, the president\u2019s phone discussion with Boehner and a White House meeting with Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid signaled an attempt to provide the nation and investors with hope that an agreement can be reached. An aide to Reid said the short-term proposal to avoid the fiscal cliff should include extending tax cuts for middle-class families and unemployment insurance while delaying the automatic spending cuts set to take effect in the new year. Obama acknowledged what had become obvious: the broader deficit reduction deal he seeks will likely come in stages, rather than in the so-called grand bargain he and Boehner have been negotiating. The main issue of disagreement continued to be taxes, specifically whether rates should go up on top income brackets for the wealthiest Americans as part of an agreement to reduce the nation\u2019s chronic federal deficits and debt. Without a deal, the fiscal cliff could trigger a recession, economists warn. Stocks closed down sharply on Friday over the latest impasse in the deficit talks, a sign of investor fears of a slowdown as the nation slowly continued to emerge from recession. Before leaving town, Boehner puts fiscal cliff onus on Obama Earlier Friday, Reid called for House Republicans to quickly approve a Senate plan championed by Obama that would extend tax cuts for family income up to $250,000 while allowing rates to return to higher levels of the 1990s above that threshold. His Republican counterpart, Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, responded that the Senate should instead take up a House Republican measure extending the tax cuts for everyone as a temporary move before negotiations next year on broader tax reform. The GOP revulsion over any kind of tax rate increase has stymied deficit negotiations for two years and led to unusual political drama, such as McConnell recently filibustering his own proposal and Thursday night\u2019s rebuff by House Republicans of an alternative tax plan pushed by Boehner, their leader. Boehner said at a news conference Friday that his Republican colleagues refused to back his plan, which would have extended all tax cuts except for income over $1 million, because of fears of being blamed for a tax increase. \u201cThey weren\u2019t taking it out on me,\u201d he said. \u201cThey were dealing with the perception that somebody might accuse them of raising taxes.\u201d The lack of backing by his own caucus was a political blow to Boehner and raised more questions than answers about what happens next in the tough negotiations with Obama on either a broad deficit reduction agreement or a smaller step to avoid the fiscal cliff. A breakdown of Boehner\u2019s miscalculation on Plan B A senior Democratic Senate source said scenarios under consideration by the party include trying to work out short-term or comprehensive agreements now, or going into next year \u2013 and over the fiscal cliff \u2013 without a deal to quickly pass a compromise plan in the new Congress that convenes on January 3. Waiting until next year would make the vote a tax cut from the automatic higher rates that will take effect under the fiscal cliff, instead of the current situation of extending some cuts and having top rates go up, the source noted. In addition, Democrats will have two more seats in the new Senate and a stronger House minority, as well as increased pressure on Republicans to keep taxes low on middle class Americans, according to the source. Three possible scenarios Democrats may pursue Trying to hammer out a deal now means working with limited time and stronger Republican contingents in both chambers, the source said. Boehner made clear Friday that the negotiations with Obama on a broad deficit reduction agreement hit an impasse this week when both sides offered their \u201cbottom line\u201d positions that included major concessions \u2013 but remained a few hundred billion dollars apart. With his alternative plan torpedoed by his own party, Boehner said it now is time for Obama and Senate Democrats to come up with a solution. Boehner also denied a reporter\u2019s suggestion that he is walking away from further talks, but he offered no timetable or mechanism for resuming discussions. In the Senate, Reid said all House measures on the fiscal cliff so far have failed to meet the minimum demands of Obama, such as wealthy Americans paying more to prevent an increased burden on middle-class families. \u201cI like John Boehner, but gee whiz, this is a pretty big political battering that he has taken,\u201d Reid said, calling on the speaker to allow a vote on the Senate-passed Obama plan. \u201cIt will pass. Democrats will vote for it. Some Republicans will vote for it. That is what we are supposed to do.\u201d On Thursday night, the House passed a measure that would reduce the impact of the fiscal cliff\u2019s automatic spending cuts on the military. However, the chamber then went into recess when it was clear Boehner lacked the votes for his separate tax plan that maintained cut rates on income up to $1 million. Conservatives opposed to any kind of increase in tax rates refused to sign on, and with Democrats unified in their opposition, the measure had no chance of passing. Fallout from fiscal cliff inaction \u201cThere was a perception created that that vote last night was going to increase taxes. I disagree with that characterization,\u201d Boehner said Friday by way of explanation, adding that \u201cthe perception was out there, and a lot of our members did not want to have to deal with it.\u201d Reid had said the Senate would spurn the Boehner plan if it passed the House, and Obama promised to veto it if it reached his desk. According to Republican sources, the zero chance for Boehner\u2019s Plan B to actually become law influenced some wavering House members to reject it. Obama campaigned for re-election on extending the tax cuts that date back to his predecessor\u2019s administration on income up to $250,000 for families, but returning to higher rates on amounts above that threshold. Some House Republicans have said they would join Democrats in supporting the president\u2019s proposal in hopes of moving past the volatile issue to focus on the spending cuts and entitlement reforms they seek. The Plan B was significant because Republican leaders previously insisted they wouldn\u2019t raise rates on anyone. Boehner had complained Thursday that in making that concession, he expected but never got significant concessions from Obama. He elaborated on the negotiations Friday, saying he told Obama that his latest proposal made over the weekend was his bottom line. Boehner said Obama told him the White House counterproposal Monday was the president\u2019s bottom line. Boehner also repeated his complaint that Obama and Democrats were unwilling to address the spending cuts and entitlement reforms that he considers necessary to properly address the nation\u2019s chronic federal deficits and debt. \u201cWhat the president has proposed so far simply won\u2019t do anything to solve our spending problems,\u201d Boehner said, noting that \u201cbecause of the political divide in the country, because of the divide here in Washington, trying to bridge these differences has been difficult.\u201d CNN Poll: Are GOP policies too extreme? In his statement Friday, Obama said he had compromised at least halfway on major issues, and that both sides have to accept they will not get all they want. The possibility of a fiscal cliff was set in motion over the past two years as a way to force action on mounting government debt. Now legislators risk looking politically cynical by seeking to weaken the measures enacted to try to force them to confront tough questions regarding deficit reduction, such as reforms to popular entitlement programs such as Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. Polling has consistently shown most Americans back the president, who insists wealthy Americans must pay more, rather than Boehner and his Republican colleagues, who have balked at tax rate hikes and demanded spending cuts and entitlement program reforms. A new CNN/ORC International survey released Thursday showed that just over half of respondents believe Republicans should give up more in any solution and consider the party\u2019s policies too extreme. Opinion: Boehner leading GOP to the apocalypse The two sides seemingly had made progress earlier this week on forging a $2 trillion deficit reduction deal that included new revenue sought by Obama and spending cuts and entitlement changes desired by Boehner. The president\u2019s latest offer set $400,000 as the income threshold for a tax rate increase, up from his original plan of $250,000.

            "article_content": "White House threatens to veto Boehner's \"plan B\" President Obama suggests Republicans are fixated on besting him personally Speaker Boehner says the House will pass his fallback tax plan Thursday Without a deal, everyone's taxes go up in the new year After progress earlier this week in fiscal cliff negotiations, President Barack Obama and House Speaker John Boehner butted heads Wednesday, setting the stage for a showdown as the deadline looms for an agreement. The negotiations had focused on a $2 trillion package of new revenue, spending cuts and entitlement changes the two sides have shaped into a broad deficit reduction plan. Boehner on Tuesday proposed a \u201cplan B,\u201d which would extend Bush-era tax cuts on income of up to $1 million. He described it as a fallback option to prevent a sweeping tax hike while negotiations continue on a broader plan. But the White House on Wednesday threatened to veto \u201cplan B,\u201d saying it would bring only \u201cminimal\u201d changes in projected budget deficits. Obama told reporters earlier in the day that Republicans were focused too much on besting him personally rather than thinking about what\u2019s best for the country. GOP offers fiscal cliff 'Plan B' Is 'Plan B' a fiscal cliff answer? Fiscal cliff power struggle See how government spends your money \u201cTake the deal,\u201d Obama said to Republicans, referring to the broader proposal, adding that it would \u201creduce the deficit more than any other deficit reduction package\u201d and would represent an achievement. \u201cThey should be proud of it,\u201d Obama said. \u201cBut they keep on finding ways to say \u2018no\u2019 as opposed to finding ways to say \u2018yes.\u2019 \u201c His comments at a White House news conference came less than two weeks before the end of the year, when the nation\u2019s taxpayers would face automatic tax increases and deep spending cuts if no agreement is reached. Economists say that failure to reach agreement could spark another recession. Boehner issued his own statement Wednesday, saying the president had yet to make a proposal offering a balance between increased revenue and spending cuts. In a 52-second appearance before reporters, Boehner said the House will pass his fallback plan Thursday limiting tax increases to income above $1 million. While the plan represents a concession from Boehner\u2019s original vow to oppose any tax-rate increase, it sets a higher threshold than the $400,000 sought by Obama. Once the House passes his plan, the president can either persuade Senate Democrats to accept it or \u201cbe responsible for the largest tax increase in American history,\u201d Boehner said before walking off without answering shouted questions. The Obama administration and congressional Democrats said Boehner changed course because he was unable to muster Republican support for the larger deal being negotiated with Obama. At his news conference, Obama alluded to last Friday\u2019s Connecticut school shootings in calling on Republicans to put aside political brinksmanship. \u201cIf there\u2019s one thing we should have after this week, it should be perspective about what\u2019s important,\u201d he said. \u201cRight now, what the country needs is for us to compromise,\u201d he continued. He characterized as \u201cpuzzling\u201d the GOP refusal to accept his compromise. Asked why an agreement was proving so elusive after both sides had made concessions, Obama said it might be that \u201cit is very hard for them to say \u2018yes\u2019 to me.\u201d \u201cAt some point they\u2019ve got to take me out of it,\u201d Obama said of Republicans, adding they should instead focus on \u201cdoing something good for the country.\u201d Boehner responded by arguing that Obama\u2019s proposal was not evenly balanced, with more new revenue instead of the spending cuts and entitlement reforms Republicans seek. The Boehner plan B would leave intact government spending cuts, including those related to defense, which are required under a budget deal reached last year to raise the federal debt ceiling. The threat of cuts was intended to motivate Congress to reach a deal. Opinion: Art that calls the fiscal cliff\u2019s bluff But Obama said Wednesday that Boehner\u2019s proposal \u201cdefies logic\u201d because it raises tax rates on some Americans, which Republicans say they do not want, and contains no spending cuts, which Republicans say they do want. He also criticized the measure as a benefit for wealthy Americans, who would have lower tax rates on income up to $1 million. The White House and congressional Democrats say plan B has no chance of passing; Obama said that bringing it up only wastes time. Senior administration officials said Obama and Boehner have not spoken to each other since Monday. GOP leaders planned to vote Thursday on Boehner\u2019s proposal, as well as Obama\u2019s long-standing proposal to return to higher tax rates of the 1990s on income above $250,000 for families. Obama on Monday raised the threshold for the higher tax rates to $400,000. Conservative allies publicly supported Boehner\u2019s plan Wednesday. Anti-tax crusader Grover Norquist provided political cover for Republicans who have signed his pledge against tax increases, saying he could support plan B. Obama and Democrats argue that increased revenue, including higher tax rates on the wealthy, must be part of broader deficit reduction plan. Obama made the tax proposal a theme of his re-election campaign, arguing that it would prevent a tax increase for middle-class Americans. Polls show support for the Obama plan, and some Republicans have called for acceding to the president on the tax issue in order to focus on cuts to spending and entitlement programs. Budget experts: Fiscal cliff deal could disappoint Boehner and Republicans initially opposed any rise in tax rates but agreed to raising revenue by eliminating some deductions and loopholes. The offer of a plan with higher rates for millionaires represented a further concession, but Obama and Democrats say it would not suffice. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada said Boehner\u2019s plan appeared to be a result of pressure from tea party conservatives opposing a wider deal. \u201cIt would be a shame if Republicans abandoned productive negotiations due to pressure from the tea party, as they have time and again,\u201d Reid said this week. Boehner\u2019s spokesman, Michael Steel, shot back that the plan B proposal gave Democrats what they wanted \u2013 higher tax rates on millionaires. What happens if the payroll tax cut expires Obama\u2019s latest offer has generated protests from the liberal base of the Democratic Party because it includes cuts in entitlement programs such as Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. Justin Ruben, executive director of MoveOn, which backed Obama\u2019s presidential campaigns, said its members would consider any benefit cuts \u201ca betrayal that sells out working and middle-class families.\u201d In particular, liberals cited concessions that Obama made Monday in his counteroffer, including a new inflation formula applied to benefits called chained CPI. Obama offers fiscal cliff tax concession Chained CPI includes assumptions on consumer habits in response to rising prices, such as seeking cheaper alternatives, and would result in smaller benefit increases in future years. Statistics supplied by opponents say the change would mean Social Security recipients would get $6,000 less in benefits over the first 15 years of chained CPI. But White House spokesman Jay Carney said Obama\u2019s CPI proposal \u201cwould protect vulnerable communities, including the very elderly, when it comes to Social Security recipients.\u201d He called the president\u2019s acceptance of the chained CPI a signal of his willingness to compromise.

            "article_content": "NEW: Boehner's plan \"can't pass the Senate,\" White House says in statement Speaker Boehner offers higher tax rates on millionaires as a back-up plan Boehner says Americans don't need more stress after the school shooting The president wants the higher rates to apply to income above $250,000 In the chess match of the fiscal cliff negotiations, President Barack Obama and House Speaker John Boehner are narrowing the divide between their positions while contending with discontent among their respective ranks. Boehner on Tuesday proposed what recently was the unthinkable for Republicans \u2013 letting tax rates go up on income above $1 million as a short-term step to avoid some of the fiscal cliff while continuing to negotiate a broader deal. The White House and Democratic leaders immediately rejected Boehner\u2019s move, saying the focus should be on a comprehensive deficit-reduction agreement instead of a partial step that no one likes. It was the latest in a series of concessions by both sides since last week\u2019s school shooting in Connecticut that killed 20 youngsters. Asked if the massacre affected what had been incremental negotiations, Boehner said: \u201cI think both sides would agree to that.\u201d Is 'Plan B' a fiscal cliff answer? Boehner shakes up fiscal cliff talks Fiscal cliff talks intensify Expert: World won't end due to cliff \u201cThis is a difficult time for Americans,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cit\u2019s not a time to put Americans through more stress.\u201d At the White House, spokesman Jay Carney acknowledged that the Newtown tragedy had affected all Americans and \u201creminds us what really matters,\u201d but he stopped short of saying it had directly impacted the talks. \u201cIt\u2019s obviously hard to know what the impact of an event like that is on the way that lawmakers and others in Washington approach other issues,\u201d Carney told reporters. He later added, \u201cTo the extent that an event like that, as tragic as it is, brings us a little closer together, both in the nation and in Washington, that would be a good thing, but it\u2019s hard to measure an impact like that.\u201d The latest back-and-forth in the negotiations came two weeks from the end of the year, when automatic tax increases and spending cuts of the fiscal cliff will take effect. Obama offers fiscal cliff tax concession At a news conference after meeting with House members Tuesday, Boehner called his new proposal a \u201cplan B\u201d to prevent  tax rates from rising on everyone next year as part of the fiscal cliff. The Ohio Republican told reporters it was important to have a \u201cbackup plan\u201d to hold down most tax rates while continuing to negotiate a broader agreement. A Republican source told CNN that Boehner\u2019s plan B also would include GOP priorities to make permanent the current estate tax and alternative minimum tax. While addressing part of the fiscal cliff, the Boehner plan B would leave intact government spending cuts, including defense, that are required under a budget deal reached last year to raise the federal debt ceiling. Known as sequestration, the cuts were intended to motivate Congress to reach a deficit-reduction deal to avoid them. In separate but similar statements, the White House and Democratic leaders said Boehner\u2019s fallback option would fail to win congressional approval, especially in the Democratically controlled Senate. Facing an insistent Obama and pressure from some in his own party, Boehner already had conceded on higher tax rates for wealthy Americans as part of the broader talks on an agreement to reduce the nation\u2019s chronic federal deficits and debt. His plan B proposal Tuesday further demonstrated the lack of leverage Republicans have on the issue. Obama has made clear that allowing tax rates to go up on top income brackets was a non-negotiable demand to ensure that the wealthy contribute more to deficit reduction. Under Obama\u2019s plan, which polls consistently show has strong public support, tax rates from the Bush era would be extended for families who earn less than $250,000. The higher rates of the 1990s would be assessed on incomes above that threshold. As part of the broader talks, Obama on Monday raised the threshold for the higher tax rates to $400,000. The Boehner proposal would set the threshold at $1 million. Democrats claimed Boehner made the plan B offer because he knows he can\u2019t get conservative House Republicans to back the agreement he is negotiating with the president. \u201cThe Republicans in the House have rejected their own speaker\u2019s proposal at this stage,\u201d Rep. Xavier Becerra of California told reporters. \u201cSo, this stage it seems like the real negotiation and fight is among Republicans.\u201d Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada said Boehner\u2019s backup plan appeared to be a result of pressure from tea party conservatives opposing a wider deal. \u201cIt would be a shame if Republicans abandoned productive negotiations due to pressure from the tea party, as they have time and again,\u201d Reid said. Boehner\u2019s spokesman, Michael Steel, shot back that the plan B proposal gave Democrats exactly what they wanted \u2013 higher tax rates on millionaires. He noted the Senate passed a similar measure in 2010, saying that to oppose Boehner\u2019s plan now would make Democrats responsible for failing to avoid the fiscal cliff. That brought a response from a spokesman for Democratic Sen. Charles Schumer of New York, who came up with the 2010 compromise that never won House approval. Since the 2010 vote, \u201cwe\u2019ve had an election on the president\u2019s tax plan, the president won, and Republicans can\u2019t turn the clock back,\u201d  said the spokesman, Brian Fallons. \u201cIt\u2019s not surprising Republicans are having buyer\u2019s remorse, but we need higher revenues now,\u201d Fallons said. \u201cThe more revenue we raise upfront through a tax rate increase on the wealthy, the less likely the middle class will get hit on the deduction side.\u201d Carney made a similar point, telling reporters that Obama wants to lock in the increased revenue from higher tax rates on top income brackets now. Expected negotiations next year on a broader reform of the tax system would be \u201crevenue neutral,\u201d meaning the changes would result in no increase or decrease of overall tax revenue, Carney said. Conservatives trying to shrink the federal government generally oppose increasing tax revenue. They are particularly opposed to higher tax rates because history shows that once rates go up, it is difficult to later reduce government revenue by lowering them again. Obama and Democrats argue that increased revenue, including higher tax rates on the wealthy, must be part of broader deficit reduction to prevent the middle class from getting hit too hard. The president previously said that once Republicans agreed to higher tax rates on wealthy Americans, he would be willing to compromise on spending cuts and entitlement reforms sought by Boehner as part of what the president calls a balanced approach. Shooting forces both sides to work harder on cliff, Boehner says Obama\u2019s latest offer brought the two sides billions of dollars closer, but it also generated protests from the liberal base of the Democratic Party because it included some benefit cuts in entitlement programs such as Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. Justin Ruben, executive director of MoveOn, the liberal movement that backed Obama\u2019s presidential campaigns, said the group\u2019s members would consider any benefit cuts \u201ca betrayal that sells out working and middle-class families.\u201d In particular, he cited concessions that Obama made in his Monday counteroffer, including a new formula for the consumer price index applied to benefits. \u201cIf such a deal were proposed by the president and speaker, MoveOn members would expect every Senate and House Democrat to do everything in their power to block it,\u201d Ruben said. A litany of other progressive groups and politicians also expressed their opposition to what is known as chained CPI. Carney, however, said Obama\u2019s latest proposal includes a provision \u201cthat would protect vulnerable communities including the very elderly when it comes to Social Security recipients.\u201d He called the president\u2019s acceptance of the chained CPI a signal of his willingness to compromise to reach a deal. The chained CPI includes assumptions on consumer habits with regard to rising prices, such as seeking cheaper alternatives, and would result in smaller benefit increases in future years. Labor unions and advocacy groups for the elderly oppose it. Over the weekend, Boehner offered for the first time to accept tax-rate increases on household income of $1 million and above, sources said. The speaker also offered to allow the president to raise the debt ceiling in 2013 without a messy political fight, another key Obama demand. In response, Obama on Monday offered $200 million in new cuts to discretionary federal government spending, divided evenly between defense and nondefense programs. The president also included for the first time the chained CPI sought by Republicans, and dropped an extension of a payroll tax cut from the past two years. According to the source who provided CNN with details of Obama\u2019s counteroffer, it includes $1.2 trillion in revenue increases and $1.22 trillion in spending reductions. However, Boehner disputed those figures Tuesday. \u201cThe White House offer yesterday was essentially $1.3 trillion in new revenues for only $850 billion in net spending reductions,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s not balanced in my opinion.\u201d Obama\u2019s latest proposal included $130 billion in spending savings due to changes in the CPI. However, Republican aides estimate that the CPI would increase tax revenues by an additional $95 billion over Obama\u2019s estimated $1.2 trillion, putting the total revenue figure of the president\u2019s latest proposal closer to $1.3 trillion. The GOP aides also do not count Obama\u2019s estimated $290 billion in savings on national debt interest accumulation because they do not consider these savings real cuts. Therefore, the Republican aides said, Obama\u2019s plan fails to offer a 1-1 ratio of spending cuts and revenue that Boehner would consider balanced. Carney took exception to the Republican math, telling reporters Tuesday that counting reduced interest on national debt was a legitimate savings counted in budget plans by both parties for years. Obama and Boehner met face to face at the White House on Monday for 45 minutes, their third such meeting in eight days in a sign of an acceleration in the fiscal cliff negotiations. They also spoke by phone later Monday. Boehner said he \u201cmade it clear to the president that I would put a trillion dollars worth of revenue on the table if he were willing to put a trillion dollars of spending reductions on the table.\u201d Parents await fate of four key tax breaks Congress had been scheduled to end its work last week, but legislators returned to Washington on Monday and leaders warned members to be prepared to stay until Christmas and return after the holiday until year-end. Last week, U.S. Rep. Chris Van Hollen, D-Maryland, said a deal would have to be reached by Christmas to allow time for the legislative process to approve the required measure or measures by the end of the year.

Continued sniping by both sides in the fiscal cliff negotiations shows little movement on the core issue - higher taxes on the wealthy. House Speaker John Boehner chose different language on Wednesday to describe his latest talks with President Barack Obama, calling a phone call the night before \u201cdeliberate\u201d and \u201cfrank.\u201d That contrasted to his use of \u201ccordial\u201d in labeling the previous discussion between the two men on Sunday. Read more: Obama, Boehner talk about GOP offer Another snag in debt talks Rep. Blackburn talks cliff compromise Rep. Cummings talks fiscal cliff deal Mother worried what no deal would mean Such a seemingly minor shift can speak volumes in the roller-coaster reality of Washington brinksmanship. Boehner clearly sought to indicate little progress in the negotiations on an agreement to reduce chronic federal deficits and debt. However, the latest talks involved counteroffers by both sides that included two shifts by the White House. Democratic sources said Obama lowered his revenue demand from $1.6 trillion to $1.4 trillion, but also added changes to the corporate rate to his proposal involving income taxes. No further details were available, but Boehner sounded unimpressed. He told reporters that Obama\u2019s latest stance remained far from a deal that he could accept or would win approval from the House and Senate. \u201cThere were some offers that were exchanged back and forth yesterday,\u201d he said, adding that \u201cthe president and I had some pretty frank conversation about how far apart we are.\u201d In particular, the Ohio Republican said that Obama\u2019s proposal failed to offer a balance between increased tax revenue and spending cuts promised by the president. \u201cIn the five weeks since we\u2019ve signaled our willingness to forge an agreement with the president, he\u2019s never put forth a plan that meets these standards,\u201d Boehner said. \u201d And frankly, it\u2019s why we don\u2019t have an agreement today.\u201d Read more: Fed drops hints on economy The White House and congressional Democrats rejected the Republican contention that the president\u2019s proposal lacked serious spending cuts and reforms to entitlement programs such as Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security as part of a comprehensive deal. Instead, they said Republicans were the ones making inadequate offers instead of seeking real compromise by agreeing to Obama\u2019s demand to maintain current tax rates for most Americans while allowing an increase on the top two income brackets. Obama has held a series of campaign-style public events to back his call for extending Bush-era tax cuts for 98% of Americans, with rates returning to higher 1990s levels on income over $250,000. That would address the main concern of the fiscal cliff, a set of automatic tax hikes and spending cuts that will begin on January 1 without an agreement between Obama and Boehner. Republican opposition in the face of support from the White House, Democrats and a majority of Americans, as shown by Obama\u2019s re-election and consistent poll results, showed GOP conservatives were holding hostage the continued tax cuts for the middle class to prevent higher rates on nation\u2019s wealthiest 2%, argued House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi. While Republicans have offered to increase tax revenue by eliminating some deductions and loopholes, they so far refuse to accept any increase in tax rates as demanded by the president. Generals: Get real and cut Pentagon spending A Democratic source told CNN that the latest Republican offer included extending all the Bush-era tax cuts set to expire at the end of the year, including rates on the top income brackets. According to the source, that signaled to Democrats that Boehner and Republicans were \u201cunwilling or unable to do any sort of deal that can pass the Senate or be signed by the president.\u201d Obama campaigned on higher taxes on the wealthy in winning re-election last month, and he and Democrats say Republicans must concede on that issue for an agreement to happen. In an interview on Tuesday with ABC News, Obama said that he was \u201cpretty confident\u201d Republicans would relent on taxes in order to get a deal. By the numbers: Fiscal cliff At the same time, the White House complained Republicans have yet to offer details on which deductions or loopholes they would eliminate to raise revenue. It was implausible for Republicans to contend that \u201cwe can somehow magically achieve significant revenue on the order that we need for that balanced deficit reduction package simply by closing loopholes that they will not name or capping deductions that they will not specify some time in the future,\u201d White House spokesman Jay Carney told reporters. \u201cThose magic beans are just beans and that fairy dust is just dust,\u201d he added. \u201cIt is not serious and the president will not sign an extension of the Bush tax cuts for the wealthiest.\u201d Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid said Wednesday that Republican talk is meaningless until they show a genuine commitment to include significant revenue in any agreement. \u201cThe American people are not going to be under the illusion that the Republicans are sometime in the future going to come up with revenue,\u201d Reid said. \u201cThey are going to come up with raising the rates\u201d or \u201cwe are going over\u201d the fiscal cliff. Homes, cars, jobs: Americans already making big decisions over fiscal cliff Time is running out for an agreement on a short-term deal to avert the fiscal cliff and set up further negotiations in the new Congress that convenes in January or a more comprehensive approach that both sides say they want. Without a deal, everyone\u2019s taxes go up and the government faces deep spending cuts, including for the military. However, the administration has signaled it can delay some of the effects to allow time to work out an agreement next year. The House is supposed to end its current session on Friday and go home for the year, but Majority Leader Eric Cantor made clear the chamber would stay later than planned. \u201cWe are going to stay here right up to Christmas Eve, throughout the time and period before the New Year, because we want to make sure we resolve this in an acceptable way for the American people,\u201d Cantor said Wednesday. With a deal needing time to be written into legislation and approved by Congress, the working deadline for an agreement this year is around Christmas Day at the latest. Senator frustrated over \u2018secret process\u2019 \u201cYou`re talking about having to have something done by Christmas, but the sooner the better,\u201d Rep. Chris Van Hollen, D-Maryland, told MSNBC on Tuesday. Polls consistently show the public favors Obama\u2019s stance in the negotiations. Nearly half of Americans \u2013 49%\u2013say they approve of the president\u2019s handling of the talks, compared to 25% who say Boehner is doing a good job, according to a new ABC News/Washington Post poll released Wednesday. Meanwhile, a new Bloomberg National Poll indicated that nearly two-thirds of respondents, including nearly 50% of Republicans, believe Obama\u2019s re-election gave him a mandate to seek higher taxes on the wealthy. Also Wednesday, an administration official said the Business Roundtable \u2013an association of CEOs of major corporations \u2013 has dropped its opposition to raising tax rates on the top two tax brackets after lobbying by the White House. Despite Boehner\u2019s adamant stance against such a tax rate hike, some cracks have appeared in his party\u2019s anti-tax facade, prompting a conservative backlash. From my home to the House: How to fix the fiscal cliff Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, promised the newly re-elected Obama \u201cone hell of a fight\u201d next year if the president forces through his plan for high-income earners to pay more taxes without agreeing to substantive steps to reduce the nation\u2019s chronic federal deficits and debt. \u201cThere will come a time in February and March where we have to raise the debt ceiling,\u201d Graham said Tuesday on \u201cPiers Morgan Tonight\u201d on CNN. \u201cI will not raise the debt ceiling ever again until we get significant entitlement reforms, because if we don\u2019t reform entitlements, we\u2019re going to become Greece.\u201d Pelosi, however, argued Tuesday that more than $1 trillion in spending cuts agreed to by Congress in the past two years should be counted toward deficit reduction in the current negotiations. Is the tea party ready to deal on fiscal cliff? Both sides call for eliminating tax deductions and loopholes to raise more revenue, but Obama also demands an end to the tax cuts of 2001 and 2003 for the top brackets. Republicans oppose the return to higher rates, saying it will inhibit job growth because small business owners declare their profits as personal income and therefore would face a tax increase. In response, Obama and Democrats note that their plan \u2013 already approved by the Senate and needing  House approval to be signed into law by the president \u2013 affects just 2% of taxpayers and 3% of small business owners. While Republicans argue those small business owners account for about half of all business income, Democrats say that\u2019s because they include law firms, hedge funds traders and other high-income operations. Retiring Sen. Kent Conrad, D-North Dakota, predicted Tuesday on MSNBC that a deal would get worked out in a week\u2019s time. \u201cIt would be wise on their part not to come too quickly with a deal because that would give all the interest groups a chance to get organized and try to kill it,\u201d Conrad said. \u201cAnd we know that on the right, on the left, special interest groups are just salivating at the chance to attack any agreement because, look, any agreement is going to have controversy attached to it.\u201d How will the \u2018fiscal cliff\u2019 affect you?

With cracks appearing in their anti-tax facade and polls showing most Americans favoring President Barack Obama\u2019s stance in the fiscal cliff negotiations, GOP legislators are starting to advocate a tactical retreat to fight another day. Conservative Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, promised the newly re-elected Obama \u201cone hell of a fight\u201d next year if the president forces through his plan for high-income earners to pay more taxes without agreeing to substantive steps to reduce the nation\u2019s chronic federal deficits and debt. \u201cBut there will come a time in February and March where we have to raise the debt ceiling,\u201d Graham said Tuesday on \u201cPiers Morgan Tonight\u201d on CNN. \u201cI will not raise the debt ceiling ever again until we get significant entitlement reforms, because if we don\u2019t reform entitlements, we\u2019re going to become Greece,\u201d adding that the situation presented a chance for Obama to lead. \u201cBut if he doesn\u2019t lead, there\u2019s going to be one hell of a fight over raising the debt ceiling.\u201d Survey: 70% want compromise Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell concurred on Tuesday, telling reporters that \u201cwe are going to insist that we have another discussion about the future of our country in connection with his request of us to raise the debt ceiling.\u201d Meanwhile, McConnell and House Speaker John Boehner on Tuesday called for Obama to make public the specific spending cuts he will offer in a deficit-reduction deal. Both complained that Obama was deliberately holding up progress in negotiations by refusing to provide the details of his cost saving plans. \u201cWhere are the president\u2019s spending cuts?\u201d asked Boehner, R-Ohio, the lead GOP negotiator. \u201cThe longer the White House slow walks this process, the closer our economy gets to the fiscal cliff.\u201d In response, White House spokesman Jay Carney said Boehner and McConnell were wrong because Obama detailed his proposed spending cuts more than a year ago. He added that Republican negotiators had yet to offer any details of their own on how to raise more revenue from taxes, \u201cand it would be helpful if they did.\u201d House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi, meanwhile, argued that the $1 trillion in spending cuts agreed to by Congress in the past two years should be counted toward deficit reduction in the current negotiations. \u201cWhere are the cuts? They\u2019re in bills that you, Mr. Speaker, have voted for,\u201d Pelosi, D-California, said Tuesday. Three weeks remain to cut a deal before the automatic tax increases and spending cuts of the fiscal cliff go into effect on January 1. Without an agreement during the current lame-duck session of Congress, everyone\u2019s taxes will go up, and economists warn the impact of the fiscal cliff could cause another recession. Obama, Boehner speak by telephone after GOP counter-offer However,  the administration has signaled it can delay some of the effects to allow time to work out an agreement when a new Congress convenes in January. Obama has held a campaign-style series of public events to back his call for extending Bush-era tax cuts for 98% of Americans while allowing rates to return to higher 1990s levels on income over $250,000. The issue was central to his re-election in November, and Obama made clear on Monday that he intended to adhere to his belief that the wealthy must contribute more. \u201cI\u2019m willing to compromise a little bit,\u201d Obama said at a Michigan diesel engine plant. However, he said higher tax rates on the the top income brackets was \u201ca principle I\u2019m not going to compromise on.\u201d The president\u2019s public push appears to be working as polls show that most Americans back the president\u2019s position. A new Politico/George Washington University survey on Monday said 60% of respondents supported Obama\u2019s proposal compared with 38% who opposed it. On Tuesday, a Gallup poll showed that 70% of adult Americans want Congress and the White House to reach a compromise that would avoid the fiscal cliff.  A similar Gallup poll last week said 62% wanted compromise. The deficit-reduction debate hinges on the tax issue, with Republicans opposing any increase in tax rates in their quest to shrink government, while Obama and Democrats want to secure more tax revenue as part of a broader package. Americans already making big decisions over fiscal cliff Both sides call for eliminating tax deductions and loopholes to raise more revenue, but Obama also demands an end to the tax cuts of 2001 and 2003 for the top brackets. Republicans oppose the return to higher rates, saying it will inhibit job growth because small business owners declare their profits as personal income and therefore would face a tax increase. In response, Obama and Democrats note that their plan \u2013 already approved by the Senate and needing  House approval to be signed into law by the president \u2013 affects just 2% of taxpayers and 3% of small business owners. While Republicans argue those small business owners account for about half of all business income, Democrats say that\u2019s because they include law firms, hedge funds traders and other high-income operations. Obama and Boehner met face to face on Sunday for the first time since November 16. It also was their first one-on-one meeting in more than a year, when deficit talks broke down. The outline for a deal has become clear in recent weeks. Both sides agree that more revenue from taxes should be part of the equation, with Obama seeking $1.6 trillion and Republicans offering $800 billion. A source close to the talks said Tuesday that the White House had floated the idea of dropping the revenue target to $1.2 trillion, then went up to $1.4 trillion on Monday. Later, Boehner spokesman Michael Steel said his side made a counteroffer to the White House \u201cthat would achieve tax and entitlement reform to solve our looming debt crisis and create more American jobs.\u201d Steel also said Boehner and Obama spoke on the phone after the Republican proposal was floated. Steel provided no further details on the counteroffer or the phone conversation, and repeated Boehner\u2019s earlier assertion that Republicans were waiting for Obama to identify specific spending cuts he would be willing to make. Federal Reserve may buy more bonds Boehner\u2019s side wants additional revenue to come from tax reform, such as eliminating some deductions and loopholes, while Obama demands the higher rates on  income over $250,000 for families as part of the equation. Republicans also seek savings from entitlement programs totaling another $800 billion or so, while Obama has proposed $400 billion in reduced entitlement costs. Social Security would not be included in the president\u2019s plan. Another sticky issue \u2013 whether the need to raise the federal debt ceiling early next year should be part of the discussion \u2013 also remains unresolved. Obama says absolutely not, while Boehner says that any increase in government borrowing to pay its bills must be offset by spending cuts. Graham\u2019s comments this week showed that Republicans plan to regroup around negotiations to raise the debt ceiling. From my home to the house: How to fix the fiscal cliff He noted that Obama proposed making permanent a process originated by McConnell that would allow the president to increase the debt ceiling and Congress to then try to block it, an unlikely scenario given Democratic control of the Senate. \u201cThat\u2019s going nowhere,\u201d Graham told Fox News on Monday, adding: \u201cHe\u2019s not king. He\u2019s president.\u201d However, a top House Democrat said that exploiting the debt ceiling for political gain would backfire on Republicans. \u201cThreatening to tank the entire economy, which is what would happen if we ever defaulted on our debt, is not a kind of negotiating strategy that is going to be popular with the American people,\u201d Rep. Chris Van Hollen told MSNBC on Monday. It remains unclear if a deal will happen before the end of the year or if the negotiations will carry over into 2013, after the fiscal cliff takes effect. Without action now on the fiscal cliff, the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center estimates that middle-class families would pay about $2,000 a year more in taxes. Even with a deal, revisions in the tax code and other changes would mean everyone pays a bit more starting next year. All signs point toward a two-step approach sought by Obama, with initial agreement now on some version of his tax plan with targets set for comprehensive negotiations on a broader deficit reduction deal in the new Congress next year. Opinion: Generals, get real and cut Pentagon spending Such an outcome would put off the main worry of the fiscal cliff, the expiration of the Bush-era tax cuts that would result in higher rates for everyone. Obama and Democrats say they would then be ready to negotiate significant savings from entitlement programs, while Republicans say they need to first see commitment on entitlement reforms before accepting any higher tax rates. McConnell, R-Kentucky, warned on the Senate floor on Tuesday that \u201cuntil the president gets specific about cuts, nobody should trust Democrats to put a dime in new revenue toward real deficit reduction or to stop their shakedown of the taxpayers at the top 2%.\u201d He and Boehner want Obama to take some of the political heat for proposing cuts to entitlement programs and other government spending. On Tuesday, congressional Democrats rejected any cuts to the Medicaid health care system for poor and disabled Americans as part of a fiscal cliff deal. The opposition by Democrats showed the pressure Obama faces from his liberal base to avoid significant changes to the entitlement program that benefits millions. Some in Congress warn that the legislative process will need at least a week to work through potentially complex measures from any proposed deal, meaning there is a de facto deadline of Christmas Day at the very latest for negotiators. Retiring Sen. Kent Conrad, D-North Dakota, predicted Tuesday on MSNBC that a deal would get worked out in a week\u2019s time. \u201cIt would be wise on their part not to come too quickly with a deal because that would give all the interest groups a chance to get organized and try to kill it,\u201d Conrad said. \u201cAnd we know that on the right, on the left, special interest groups are just salivating at the chance to attack any agreement because, look, any agreement is going to have controversy attached to it.\u201d iReport: How will the fiscal cliff affect you?

To President Barack Obama, it\u2019s all about first locking in additional revenue from raising taxes on high-income owners, an outcome the GOP has long rejected. Republicans led by House Speaker John Boehner want to secure commitments on entitlement reforms and spending cuts opposed by Democrats as part of a broader agreement to reduce the nation\u2019s chronic federal deficits and debt. A GOP source told CNN that talks between staff members on both sides resumed Thursday for the first time this week, after Obama and Boehner spoke by phone the day before. Meanwhile, retiring Republican Rep. Steve LaTourette of Ohio told CNN that he sensed a shift in the House GOP approach during a conference meeting Wednesday. Starbucks CEO's fiscal cliff warning Fiscal cliff grows closer every day Signs of progress in fiscal cliff battle Lessons on how Congress can compromise \u201cThe sense was that there\u2019s a growing number of folks in our party that are saying, \u2018You know what, the president has won this round relative to the rates, but we need to you to sit down and get the second half of the deal and that\u2019s the spending,\u2019\u201d LaTourette said. GOP senator backs tax rate hike on wealthy It remains unclear if a deal will happen before the end of the year \u2013 less than four weeks away \u2013 or if the negotiations will carry over into 2013 after the fiscal cliff of automatic tax hikes and spending cuts takes effect. While economists warn that going over the fiscal cliff could lead to a recession, the administration has signaled it can delay some of the impacts to allow time to work out a deal. All signs point toward a two-step approach sought by the newly re-elected Obama \u2013 an initial agreement that would extend lower tax rates for income up to $250,000 for families, while letting rates return to higher levels from the Clinton era on income above that threshold. Even conservatives such as Oklahoma Sen. Tom Coburn and Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal acknowledge the obvious \u2013 taxes on the wealthy are going up despite opposition by Republicans. \u201cWhatever deal is reached is going to contain elements that are detrimental to our economy,\u201d Jindal wrote Thursday in an opinion piece published by Politico. \u201cElections have consequences, and the country is going to feel those consequences soon.\u201d Decisions Americans are already making over fiscal cliff At the same time, Jindal wrote, \u201cRepublicans certainly should fight to at least get something done that will matter.\u201d \u201cAt present, any reading of the headlines over the past week indicates that Republicans are fighting to protect the rich and cut benefits for seniors,\u201d he added. \u201cIt may be possible to have worse political positioning than that, but I\u2019m not sure how.\u201d Coburn, a notorious fiscal hawk, told MSNBC on Wednesday that he would support higher tax rates on wealthier Americans as part of a broader deal to avoid the fiscal cliff and broader deficit crisis. \u201cI know we have to raise revenue,\u201d Coburn said. \u201cI don\u2019t really care which way we do it. Actually, I would rather see rates go up than do it the other way, because it gives us a greater chance to reform the tax code and broaden the base in the future.\u201d After meeting with his conference Wednesday, Boehner told reporters that the rich will be paying more, but he still hoped to limit any increase to ending tax deductions and loopholes rather than Obama\u2019s demand for higher rates. \u201cWe have got to cut spending and I believe it is appropriate to put revenues on the table,\u201d Boehner said. \u201cNow, the revenues that we are putting on the table are going to come from guess who? The rich.\u201d Fiscal cliff could bring paycheck panic He continued, \u201cThere are ways to limit deductions, close loopholes and have the same people pay more of their money to the federal government without raising tax rates, which we believe will harm our economy.\u201d Obama, however, continued to insist that Republicans must agree to higher tax rates for the wealthiest Americans before working out a broader agreement on tackling the nation\u2019s chronic federal deficits and debt. Under his plan, 98% of the country would have current rates extended, with higher rates affecting only 2% of top earners, the president and Democrats note. \u201cI\u2019m not going to sign any package that somehow prevents the tax rate from going up for folks in the top 2%,\u201d Obama said Thursday at a campaign-style visit with a Virginia family to discuss the tax issue. The statements reflected how negotiations on the the fiscal cliff have evolved since last month\u2019s election, when Obama won a second term and Democrats made gains in both chambers of Congress. Republicans opposed to any new revenue in their quest to shrink government now realize Obama\u2019s victory and public support for the president\u2019s campaign theme of higher taxes on the wealthy leave them with little negotiating leverage. A new poll Thursday was the third in recent days to indicate most Americans accepted raising taxes on incomes over $250,000 as part of a fiscal cliff deal. The Quinnipiac University national survey showed 65% of registered voters support higher taxes on the wealthy, though Republican respondents were opposed,53% to 41%. Also, a Washington Post/Pew Research Center survey released Tuesday showed 53% of respondents would blame Republicans for failure to reach a deal, compared with 27% who would blame Obama. A CNN/ORC International poll released last week showed 45% would blame congressional Republicans compared with 34% who would hold Obama responsible. Read more: The road to fiscal cliff paved with good intentions Despite the public stance softening of some Republicans in each house, signs point to a continuing standoff for now. Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell warned Thursday that his party will continue to use the federal debt-ceiling issue as leverage to extract concessions on spending cuts from Democrats, a tactic that Obama opposes. \u201cThe only way we ever cut spending around here is by using the debate over the debt limit to do it,\u201d McConnell said in response to Obama\u2019s call for removing the issue from political negotiation. At the White House, spokesman Jay Carney said such brinksmanship over a matter involving a possible unprecedented government default was opposed by the business community and the American public. \u201cI can\u2019t imagine they would want to do that,\u201d he said of Republicans. The House is scheduled to adjourn for the year on December 14, but Boehner\u2019s number two, Majority Leader Eric Cantor, said Wednesday the chamber would remain in session until a fiscal cliff deal gets reached. Boehner, meanwhile, challenged Obama to talk, saying, \u201cI\u2019ll be here and I\u2019ll be available at any moment to sit down with the president to get serious about solving this problem.\u201d Obama demands that the House immediately pass a measure already approved by the Senate to extend tax cuts from 2001 and 2003 on income up to $250,000 for families. He contends that both Democrats and Republicans agree that the 98% of American families making less than $250,000 a year should avoid a tax hike when the lower rates from the Bush administration expire on December 31. They call for the House to guarantee that outcome by passing the Senate measure now. Once that happens, Obama and Democratic leaders promise, they will work out compromises on other spending cuts sought by Republicans to reduce the deficit, such as reforms to the Medicare and Medicaid entitlement programs. The latest proposal from House Republicans could reduce federal deficits by $2.2 trillion over 10 years, GOP leaders say. The GOP proposal includes $800 billion from tax reform, $600 billion from Medicare reforms and other health savings and $600 billion in other spending cuts, House Republican leadership aides said. It also pledges $200 billion in savings by revising the consumer price index, a measure of inflation. While the Republicans gave ground by calling for more revenue through tax reform, the plan mentioned only unspecified elimination of some deductions and loopholes. Opinion: Millionaires\u2019 tax bracket would be a smart compromise Obama\u2019s broader deficit reduction plan calls for deficit reduction of about $500 billion over 10 years by limiting itemized tax deductions and other benefits for high-income earners. The 28% limit on deductions would apply to families earning more than $250,000 and individuals making more than $200,000, according to the White House. Jason Furman, an assistant to Obama on economic policy, told reporters Wednesday that the president wants to ensure additional revenue from higher taxes on the wealthy now to help avoid the fiscal cliff. \u201cWhat we\u2019re seeking to do is to lock in revenue this year, not have some vague process that may or may not add up to something, you know, in the future, and so we\u2019re trying to pass something this month,\u201d Furman said. While the White House has made clear Obama will veto any measure that fails to increase tax rates on the wealthy, aides have signaled a possible willingness to negotiate the specific rate increase. In an interview with Bloomberg TV this week, Obama said lower tax rates for the wealthy could be negotiated as part of broader tax reform in 2013, but only after those rates increase now. Obama\u2019s deficit-reduction plan would increase taxes by almost $1 trillion over 10 years, a significant portion of a $4 trillion overall deficit-reduction goal. It also would close loopholes, limit deductions, raise the estate tax rate to 2009 levels and increases tax rates on capital gains and dividends. The Obama plan includes $50 billion in stimulus spending for programs intended to create jobs, such as repairing roads and bridges. Experts have said failing to reach a fiscal cliff deal and devise a framework for a broader deficit reduction package to be negotiated when the new Congress is seated in January would cause economic turmoil. The non-partisan Tax Policy Center estimates that middle-class families would pay about $2,000 a year more in taxes without action.

In remarks to business leaders on Wednesday, Obama said Boehner and Republicans have to take the first step. \u201cI think there is recognition that maybe they can accept some rate increases as long as it is combined with serious entitlement reform and additional spending cuts,\u201d the president said. \u201cAnd if we can get the leadership on the Republican side to take that framework, to acknowledge that reality, then the numbers actually aren\u2019t that far apart.\u201d He added that \u201cwe can probably solve this in about a week \u2013 it\u2019s not that tough.\u201d The statements reflected how negotiations on the automatic spending cuts and tax hikes set to occur on January 1 \u2013 the fiscal cliff \u2013 have evolved since Obama\u2019s re-election, and Democratic gains in both houses of Congress, last month.

Polls show that more Americans will blame Republicans, instead of Obama and Democrats, if there is no deal and the nation goes over the fiscal cliff. A Washington Post/Pew Research Center survey released Tuesday put the margin at 53%-27% in citing Republicans or Obama. A CNN/ORC International poll released last week showed 45% would blame congressional Republicans compared to 34% who would hold Obama responsible.

            "article_content": "Most House GOP members giving speaker some room to get a deal Boehner has promised to push back against the White House Boehner and Obama speak by phone, but no movement reported U.S. House Speaker John Boehner has faced tricky negotiations before. He bargained with President Barack Obama and the Democratic-led Senate over the debt ceiling, funding the government and extending tax cuts. In every case, the speaker\u2019s boisterous conference of conservatives refused to fall in line, resisting almost every major concession Boehner tried to put on the table to extract something for his side. But for now, the high stakes game over reaching a deal to avert the fiscal cliff seems different. The rich will pay more taxes, Boehner says Hensarling: No vote for revenue increase Rep. Cole: Extend tax cuts under $250K Borger: Cliff is Congress' own creation There are some GOP defections, but the loud resistance and \u201chell no\u201d sentiment many fiscal conservatives expressed in the past don\u2019t appear evident. Instead, the majority of House Republicans are allowing the speaker some room to find a way to get to a deal. Earlier in the week, Boehner and top House Republican leaders delivered a counter offer to the White House\u2019s opening bid that offered up to $800 billion in new revenue from closing loopholes and capping deductions for wealthier Americans \u2013 a break from their party\u2019s position that no new tax increases were needed. While several prominent Senate conservatives and outside groups immediately rejected the proposal, this time most House Republicans either stood with Boehner or muted their criticism.  Many of those who openly challenged Boehner in the past, instead, trained their fire on the White House. Conservatives blast Boehner tax increases; other Republicans withhold criticism At the weekly meeting on Wednesday of all House Republicans, Boehner gave the loose outline of his offer, but didn\u2019t give any additional details on the plan or next steps. But he pledged to push back at the president, who is arguing the GOP has to accept his terms because he won the election. \u201cThe American people re-elected him - and they re-elected us. That\u2019s not a mandate to raise tax rates. It\u2019s a mandate to work together,\u201d Boehner said, according to remarks provided to CNN by a House GOP leadership aide. Most Republicans leaving the meeting told CNN they think the speaker\u2019s strategy is a good one. \u201cThe speaker has the full support of the conference to move forward and to get something done for the American people,\u201d Louisiana Republican Charles Boustany told CNN. \u201cWe\u2019re united,\u201d said Texas Republican Pete Sessions. New Jersey Republican Scott Garrett, a leading fiscal conservative who has voted against GOP leaders in the past, told CNN \u201cthe speaker has done an admirable job, I think, of being forthright \u2013 so much fuller than the president has been saying this is our plan. This is our offer.\u201d Aiding the speaker\u2019s effort to keep his troops in line is the widespread frustration among GOP members who think Obama is overreaching and focusing on political pressure instead of serious negotiations. \u201cThe president has to show up and negotiate. He needs to quit running around the country, sit down across the table from the speaker, get the Senate majority leader in the room, and they need to start working,\u201d Boustany said. Asked why this debate is different, Boehner said Wednesday that his GOP colleagues recognize what\u2019s at stake. \u201cI think our members understand the seriousness of the situation that our country faces. Trillion dollar deficits for as far as the eye can see. Sixteen-trillion dollars \u2026 every man, woman and child, the number is increasing every single year. As result, our members understand we\u2019ve got to solve the problem and we will.\u201d Despite many giving the speaker some breathing room there are some cracks in the GOP\u2019s efforts to show a united front. Last week one veteran member, Oklahoma Rep Tom Cole, suggested that the House Republicans agree to Democrats demands to hold a vote just on tax cuts for the middle class. Cole defends position on tax compromise in fiscal cliff battle GOP divide over Obama tax plan goes public One conservative freshman lawmaker wasn\u2019t sold on Boehner\u2019s plan on taxes, and warned that the Speaker\u2019s message wasn\u2019t winning the PR battle on the fiscal cliff fight. \u201cI just think raising taxes is a bad idea,\u201d Idaho Rep. Raul Labrador told CNN. \u201cBut my main message right now to the conference and to America is that Republicans need to keep focusing on individuals. We\u2019re losing the messaging battle. Our job is to protect the American citizen not American businesses. Businesses can take care of themselves.\u201d Ohio Republican Steve LaTourette is circulating a letter with some Democrats urging leaders of both parties give some ground on their sacred cows - taxes and entitlements. \u201cI and some others are advocating give the president what he wants but only as part of the four or five trillion-dollar package,\u201d LaTourette said, but argued a big deal means Democrats need to bend too. But Democrats feel they are the ones with the upper hand in these negotiations and that a growing number of Republicans will eventually break ranks and force Boehner to agree to their terms. \u201cThey are more and more facing a reality that there was an election,\u201d Rep Sander Levin, the top Democrat on the tax writing Ways and Means Committee, said of House GOP members. \u201cThey need to accept it.\u201d Sen. Chuck Schumer argued there are more Republicans who disagree with Boehner, but they aren\u2019t going public yet. \u201cIn addition to those Republicans who have spoken out publicly, there are probably dozens of other Tom Coles in the House who just don\u2019t feel free to speak their mind but certainly agree with him privately,\u201d Schumer, a New York Democrat, said. Levin argued the GOP math simply doesn\u2019t add up to get significant tax revenue without allowing the current tax rates for the upper income Americans to expire, so they will be forced to come around. As in previous high level negotiations with the president, House Republicans recognize that they are supporting players, and the final stages of this debate will play out behind closed doors with the president and Boehner. Boehner \u201chas to see if they can get to a private conversation,\u201d said CNN Senior Political Analyst David Gergen. \u201cThe deal has to be cut privately.\u201d But if and when the negotiations get to the point where the president and the speaker start serious horse trading, that may be when significant numbers of conservatives part ways with Boehner. Right now, there are scant details and many members don\u2019t have a lot to shoot at, so they are withholding judgment. After no direct conversations between the two men for a week, Boehner and Obama spoke by phone on Wednesday, but there was no movement on the main sticking point of tax rates, sources familiar with the conversation told CNN In previous negotiations over a potential government shut down and the renewal of the payroll tax when information began to leak on the shape of proposals, conservatives felt blindsided about being handed a deal and asked to sign on while staring down a deadline.

            "article_content": "House Speaker Boehner also launches a series of events President Obama takes his tax message to the public, again Uncertainty over a deal to avoid the fiscal cliff causes market jitters Tax hikes and spending cuts loom without a deal in the next five weeks It helped get him re-elected, so President Barack Obama is again employing campaign-style tactics to increase pressure on congressional Republicans to compromise to avoid the so-called fiscal cliff. Failure to reach a deal means tax increases and deep spending cuts take effect in five weeks, a scenario analysts fear could push the country back into recession. While aides on both sides have been talking, no follow-up meeting between Obama and congressional leaders has been scheduled after their initial post-election discussion on November 16. Instead, Obama met Tuesday with small business owners, the first in a series of events this week intended to highlight his push for raising taxes on the wealthiest 2% of Americans while maintaining current rates for everyone else. Norquist: Rep. King \u2018tried to weasel out\u2019 Van Hollen: Obama budget is 'balanced' Sen. Lee talks fiscal cliff, deficit Toomey: Obama determined to increase tax Congresswoman Waters talks fiscal cliff On Wednesday, Obama meets with the chief executives of major corporations, while congressional Republicans and Democrats will talk separately with deficit-reduction gurus, including former White House Chief of Staff Erskine Bowles and Maya MacGuinneas of the Committee for a Responsible Federal Budget, a bipartisan group advocating fiscal reform. The president also will meet with those described by the White House as middle-class Americans who face a major impact if higher taxes and automatic reductions in military and discretionary federal spending take hold. Obama concludes the week with a trip Friday to Hatfield, Pennsylvania, to visit a manufacturing operation and deliver a speech. Meanwhile, House Speaker John Boehner\u2019s office announced Tuesday that congressional Republicans will hold a series of events in Washington and home districts across the country with small business owners to frame Obama\u2019s tax policy as a threat to new jobs. The series of meetings involving all parties showed the high-profile tactics being used to demonstrate to the nation, including financial markets, that a deal can happen. Stocks closed lower Tuesday as investors grew increasingly concerned about whether Congress can adequately and swiftly address the situation. Prospects for a deal remain front and center for investors, with the U.S. economy showing more signs of improvement in its long recovery from recession. Economists point to fears about higher taxes in 2013 as a potential threat to rising consumer confidence. Asked why Obama was meeting with business leaders and traveling to Pennsylvania instead of negotiating directly with Republicans in Congress, White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said Tuesday it was important to bring the broader American public into the discussion. Read more: Fiscal battle over mortgage deduction The fiscal cliff resulted from a failure to reach a deficit reduction agreement in the past two years due to longstanding differences between Democrats and Republicans on taxes \u2013 particularly whether to extend tax cuts from President George W. Bush\u2019s administration. Obama made the issue a central theme of his election campaign, and now the White House believes the president\u2019s re-election validated his call for including more tax revenue in addressing the nation\u2019s chronic federal deficits and debt. \u201cThis topic was perhaps the most debated, the most discussed, the most analyzed, for a year,\u201d   Carney told reporters on Tuesday, adding that the election result showed Americans supported Obama\u2019s approach. \u201cTo suggest that we should, now that the election\u2019s over, stop talking to the American people about these vital issues is, I think, bad advice,\u201d Carney said. Durbin: We need to preserve Medicare Norquist: No room for GOP tax compromise Warner: We got to get it done Is Obama key to fiscal cliff deal? Last week, Obama\u2019s former campaign manager, Jim Messina, said the president\u2019s re-election campaign and its grass-roots resources will \u201clive on,\u201d most likely as a tool to promote the president\u2019s second-term policies. Obama for America, the name of the campaign, already released an e-mail to its distribution list in an attempt to educate readers on the president\u2019s fiscal cliff argument and to rally supporters behind him. Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky complained that Obama was \u201cback on the campaign trail\u201d instead of \u201csitting down with lawmakers of both parties and working out an agreement.\u201d \u201cWe already know the president is a very good campaigner,\u201d McConnell said on the Senate floor. \u201d \u2026 What we don\u2019t know is whether he has the leadership qualities necessary to lead his party to a bipartisan agreement on big issues like we currently face.\u201d The president wants to let tax rates for income over $250,000 for families or $200,000 for individuals return to higher 1990s levels, while maintaining current rates for the rest of the country.  He contends his plan would prevent a tax hike for 98% of Americans. Read more: Will potential FAA cuts hurt fliers? Republicans oppose increasing any tax rates, arguing that Obama\u2019s plan would hinder job growth because some small business owners who file personal returns would pay higher taxes under it. After meeting with Obama on Tuesday, three of the 15 small business owners who took part said they wanted certainty about their own tax situations while preventing middle-class Americans from paying higher taxes. Andra Rush, who founded Rush Trucking of Wayne, Michigan, said her message to Obama was that failure to extend the tax cuts to the middle class could stall what she called new economic momentum in the country. \u201cI would have higher tax rates,\u201d Rush conceded, adding that it was more important for \u201cordinary Americans\u201d to have more money to spend instead of paying it in taxes if everyone\u2019s rates go up. Karen Mills, who heads the government\u2019s Small Business Administration, said the main message to Obama in the meeting was that the owners needed certainty in their tax situations so they could plan for next year. Boehner and other influential GOP figures have declared their willingness to consider other ways to boost tax revenue as part of a broader deal that includes entitlement reforms and spending cuts. That position undermines the no-tax-increase pledge championed by anti-tax crusader Grover Norquist, which Democrats consider to be a major impediment to a deficit reduction deal. Some Republicans \u2013  including conservative Sens. John McCain of Arizona, Bob Corker of Tennessee, Saxby Chambliss of Georgia, Tom Coburn of Oklahoma and Lindsay Graham of South Carolina as well as Rep. Peter King of New York and Scott Rigell of Virginia \u2013 have dropped their adherence to Norquist\u2019s pledge. Norquist responded harshly Monday night, telling CNN that those denouncing the pledge were breaking their commitment to voters. He targeted King for saying a pledge signed years ago no longer applied. King \u201ctried to weasel out\u201d of the pledge, adding: \u201cI hope his wife understands commitments last a little longer than two years or something.\u201d According to Norquist, King knew when he signed the pledge that it applied to \u201cas long as you\u2019re in Congress.\u201d Opinion: Don\u2019t be scared of Grover Norquist \u201cIt\u2019s only as long as you\u2019re in the House or the Senate. If he stayed too long, that\u2019s his problem,\u201d Norquist added. To CNN Chief Political Analyst Gloria Borger, the softening tone by some in the GOP was explained by new poll numbers that showed 45% of Americans would blame Republicans for failing to avoid the fiscal cliff, while 34% would blame Obama. Republicans insist Democrats must agree to cut discretionary spending and make significant reforms to Medicare and Social Security as part of a deficit reduction deal. However, organized labor and other elements of the Democratic base oppose any major reforms to the popular entitlement programs. While some Democratic legislators express willingness to reform Medicare and Medicaid, they reject making  Social Security reform part of the fiscal cliff negotiations, saying it is self-funded and therefore doesn\u2019t add to the deficit. Obama spoke by phone over the weekend with Boehner and Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid, Carney said Monday, and he rejected a reporter\u2019s assertion Tuesday that no progress was taking place in efforts to avoid the fiscal cliff. On Capitol Hill, a Senate Democratic leadership aide said Monday that behind-the-scenes talks have \u201chaven\u2019t been tremendously productive.\u201d Negotiations were not at a point \u201cwhere people are huddled in a conference room with spread sheets\u201d but are instead at the early \u201cdancing stage,\u201d the Democratic aide said. Congressional Republican leadership aides declined to characterize the state of the talks, though one noted the fact that discussions continued could be interpreted as progress. The CNN/ORC International poll released Monday also showed that a solid majority of respondents \u2013 two thirds \u2013 supports the Democratic stance that any agreement should include a mix of spending cuts and tax increases. Of that total, Republicans favor such an approach by 52%-44%. Read more: House Republicans launch PR offensive on fiscal cliff Without a deal, tax cuts from 2001 and 2003 \u2013 when George W. Bush was president \u2013 will expire, raising rates for everyone starting in January. In addition, spending cuts would reduce spending on the military, national parks, the Federal Aviation Administration and other government services. However, the government and Congress still would have time to prevent draconian effects from the fiscal cliff when a new Congress convenes in January. William Galston, a senior fellow in governance studies at the Brookings Institution, called that a form of brinksmanship best avoided. \u201cTo be sure, no one believes that non-agreement by December 31 would be the end of the story. After a period of finger-pointing, discussions would resume,\u201d he wrote last week in a New Republic opinion piece. \u201cBut equally, no one knows how the failure to reach agreement before the end of 2012 would affect the dynamics of the negotiations.\u201d In addition, \u201cwe can be reasonably sure \u2026 that national and global markets would react adversely and that businesses, which are already retreating from planned investments in new plant and equipment, would become even more uncertain and risk-averse.\u201d Read more: Time running out on debt ceiling CNN\u2019s Ashley Killough, Deirdre Walsh, Dan Lothian, Ted Barrett, Lesa Jansen, Martina Stewart, Kevin Liptak and Paul Steinhauser contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "The GOP's next presidential nominee might be at Republican governors gathering New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie tops the list, but he has tough reelection fight ahead Joe Biden and Hillary Clinton are mentioned most often as Democratic candidates GOP strategist says retread from past races won't be able to take party into the future Get ready: The 2016 campaign for the White House is getting under way. Among those attending next week\u2019s Republican Governors Association meeting in Las Vegas are the group\u2019s chairman, Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell, as well as popular Republican governors such as New Jersey\u2019s Chris Christie, Wisconsin\u2019s Scott Walker and Louisiana\u2019s Bobby Jindal. While the RGA\u2019s annual confabs are all about policy and politics, 2016 is sure to come up because all four governors are thought to be contenders for the party\u2019s next presidential nomination. Even though the 2012 election is barely in the rear view mirror, speculation over the next race for the White House is getting started. With President Barack Obama winning a second term on Tuesday, an incumbent will not run in 2016, meaning both parties may have competitive nomination battles. Biden: \u2018You\u2019ll vote for me in 2016\u2019 Hillary Clinton saying 'no' to 2016 run Biden hints he may be on future ballots Marco Rubio introduces Romney at RNC Christie defends his RNC speech The two names grabbing the most attention in the hunt for the next Democratic nomination are Vice President Joe Biden and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. As he was leaving a Delaware voting booth on Election Day, Biden was asked whether it was the last time he\u2019d cast a ballot for himself. \u201cNo, I don\u2019t think so,\u201d he replied, smiling. Last month, he dropped a mention of a possible \u201916 bid. While on a phone call with a voter in Florida, the vice president discussed health care and insurance, making his case for the president\u2019s health care reform law. \u201cAnd after it\u2019s all over, when your insurance rates go down, then you\u2019ll vote for me in 2016,\u201d he said. Biden, who will be 73 on Election Day 2016, made unsuccessful bids for the nomination in 1988 and 2008. As for Hillary Clinton, it doesn\u2019t matter how many times the soon-to-be-former secretary of state says she won\u2019t run for president again, there\u2019s always speculation that she may change her mind between now and the next presidential cycle. When asked by Marie Claire magazine last month if she would make another bid for the White House, she said, \u201cNo, I\u2019m not.\u201d Hillary Clinton repeats \u2018no\u2019 for 2016 \u201cI have been on this high wire of national and international politics and leadership for 20 years,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cIt has been an absolutely extraordinary personal honor and experience. But I really want to just have my own time back. I want to just be my own person. I\u2019m looking forward to that.\u201d But until she makes a Shermanesque statement, speculation will continue. \u201cThe truth is, everyone else is frozen until Hillary decides what she wants to do,\u201d a Democratic strategist, who asked to remain anonymous, told CNN. In addition to Biden and Clinton, there are some other possibilities. Former New York Gov. Mario Cuomo did not run for the Democratic nomination in 1992, which went to Bill Clinton, but will his son, New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, go where his father did not? Cuomo is up for re-election in 2014. Also possibly considering the White House is term-limited Maryland Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley, the current chairman of the Democratic Governors Association. Other governors who might be considering runs are Deval Patrick of Massachusetts and outgoing Montana Gov. Brian Schweitzer. And then there\u2019s the U.S. Senate, where all 100 members may imagine themselves as president. Sens. Mark Warner of Virginia, Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota, Kirsten Gillibrand of New York, and even Sen.-elect Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts could be on any list of potential presidential candidates. The Democratic strategist has some advice for potential candidates: \u201cEveryone who wants to run for president in the Democratic Party should beat a path to Jim Messina\u2019s door. Then camp out in Iowa.\u201d Messina was Obama\u2019s campaign manager, and Iowa, of course, traditionally kicks off the presidential primary and caucus calendar. As for the Republicans, Christie is at the top of any potential list. But before any run for the White House,  the New Jersey governor next year faces what may be a tough re-election campaign in a blue state. McDonnell, who is term-limited at the end of this year and who was considered a possible running mate for Mitt Romney, may want to make a bid for the top spot. Walker is a hero to many conservatives, thanks to his battles against public sector workers in Wisconsin. After surviving a recall election this year, Walker is up for re-election in 2014. Christie: Romney \u2018didn\u2019t get enough votes\u2019 Jindal, who\u2019s very popular among fiscal as well as social conservatives, is also entertaining thoughts of running for president, and Texas Gov. Rick Perry, who has to decide about running for re-election in 2014, may also take a second shot at the GOP nomination. Romney\u2019s running mate, Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, returns to his leadership role in the House. Will Ryan, a favorite of fiscal conservatives and many tea party activists, make a run for the top spot in the next presidential cycle? This week\u2019s election proved that the GOP has a problem with Latino voters. Will freshman Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, a GOP rock star who\u2019s urging his party to address this problem, make a run for the White House? If he doesn\u2019t, maybe his mentor,  two-term former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, who has strong relations with the Hispanic community, could make a bid. Rubio, by the way, will be in Iowa in a week and a half to headline an event for the state\u2019s Republican governor. Rubio isn\u2019t the only Republican senator whose name comes up. Add John Thune of South Dakota to the list. And will freshman Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky follow in his father\u2019s footsteps and run for president? Rand Paul talks 2016 prospects The GOP is famous for awarding the nomination to the candidate who came in second in the previous primary cycle, like with Romney this time. If that\u2019s the case, then watch former Sen. Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania. He gave Romney a run for his money, he\u2019s from an electoral-vote-rich state that the Republicans think they can reclaim, he\u2019s got a working-class background, and he\u2019s beloved by social conservatives. Add in two more names from the 2008 cycle: Former Arkansas Gov. Mike Huckabee, who performed much better than expected in the GOP primaries, and former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin, who was her party\u2019s vice presidential nominee that year. Huckabee is still popular, thanks to his radio programs and weekly show on Fox News Channel, and Palin still commands a loyal conservative following. \u201cThere is a vacuum of leadership right now in the Republican Party. Whoever steps up right now to point the party toward its future will help the party and advance their own fortunes politically,\u201d says Republican strategist and CNN contributor Alex Castellanos. But Castellanos, who was a senior media adviser to Romney\u2019s 2008 White House bid, says don\u2019t look to the past. Wishing for a Rubio run \u201cThe next Republican nominee will be tasked with taking the party into the future. It won\u2019t be the old retreads. It won\u2019t be Santorum, Huckabee or Palin. We need a new Republican from the ranks of GOP governors, senators, or even Jeb Bush and (former Secretary of State) Condi Rice who still represent the GOP\u2019s future.\u201d So what do these possible 2016 wannabes do as the very early preseason begins? If they don\u2019t have leadership PACs already, they form them, make speeches, campaign for fellow party members in the 2013 and 2014 races, write books and do cable news interviews, as they build up allies and support in the states that vote early in the primary and caucus calendar. \u201cThis isn\u2019t a phase where people decide to run for president, it\u2019s when they start to do things that leave that door open,\u201d says a different Democratic strategist, who predicts that  \u201cthere will be a wide open field on both sides next time around.\u201d",

            "article_content": "President Barack Obama says his election victory shows America backs his plan House Speaker John Boehner says all options on spending and revenue are open While both sides signal a willingness to deal, differences on details remain The nation faces tax hikes and steep spending cuts at the end of the year Flush with re-election vigor, President Barack Obama called Friday for House Republicans to immediately pass a bill already approved by the Senate that would maintain current tax rates for middle-class Americans while increasing taxes of wealthier citizens. In his first public comments since winning Tuesday\u2019s vote, Obama expressed openness to negotiate with Congress on how to deal with pending tax hikes and spending cuts that create the so-called fiscal cliff facing the economy at the end of the year. However, he also repeated his longstanding demand that Republican opponents to any kind of tax increase relent to the will of the White House and the Senate \u2013 and now the American people \u2013 in letting tax rates increase on income over $250,000. Nobody in either party wants the middle class, identified as families making less than $250,000 a year, to see taxes increase at the end of the year when lower rates set during the administration of former President George W. Bush will expire, Obama said. \u201cThat makes no sense. It would be bad for the economy,\u201d he told a White House gathering of what aides described as middle class Americans. \u201cLet\u2019s extend middle class tax cuts right now. Let\u2019s do that right now. That one step would give millions of families, 98% of Americans, 97% of small businesses, the certainty that they need going into the new year.\u201d Noting the Senate previously passed a bill to extend the tax cuts to the middle class, but not income over $250,000, Obama said: \u201cAll we need is action from the House.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve got the pen,\u201d he said, reaching into his pocket to hold one up as the crowd applauded. \u201cI\u2019m ready to sign the bill right away. I\u2019m ready to do it.\u201d The president also announced he invited congressional leaders from both parties to the White House next week to launch talks on finding a solution to the fiscal cliff, as well as consensus on how to strike a comprehensive deal to reduce the nation\u2019s chronic federal deficits and debt. Separately, a bipartisan group of senators known as the \u201cGang of Eight\u201d will reconvene next week to \u201cassess where they are\u201d in working out a bipartisan compromise on a long-term deficit agreement, a Senate aide told CNN on Friday. The group\u2019s previous talks have yet to bring a breakthrough. The gang of eight includes Democrats Mark Warner of Virginia, Dick Durbin of Illinois, Michael Bennet of Colorado and the retiring Kent Conrad of North Dakota, along with Republicans Saxby Chambliss of Georgia, Tom Coburn of Oklahoma, Mike Crapo of Idaho, and Mike Johanns of Nebraska. Opinion: Leave crisis to Congress Long and tough negotiation While offering to consider unspecified reforms to costly entitlement programs sought by Republicans, Obama\u2019 s initial salvo in what will be a long and tough negotiation signaled he was unwilling to back down on the tax issue that was a central theme of his election campaign. \u201cOn Tuesday night, we found out that the majority of Americans agree with my approach and that includes Democrats, independents and a lot of Republicans across the country, as well as independent economists and budget experts,\u201d the president said. \u201cThat\u2019s how you reduce the deficit; with a balanced approach so our job now is to get a majority in Congress to reflect the will of the American people.\u201d What\u2019s in the fiscal cliff? Obama and House Speaker John Boehner are positioned as the lead negotiators in a showdown between Democrats and Republicans over the issue identified by voters as a top priority: reducing the chronic federal deficits and debt considered a threat to economic prosperity and national security. Boehner: U.S. can avoid financial cliff 'Fiscal cliff' could bring recession Boehner, R-Ohio, signaled a willingness to deal on Friday but also maintained hard-line GOP opposition to any tax increase. \u201cRaising tax rates will slow down our ability to create the jobs everyone says they want,\u201d Boehner said at a news conference, noting that higher taxes on the wealthy will hit small business owners. Later, however, he said that \u201ceverything on the revenue side and on the spending side has to be looked at.\u201d Boehner also called on Obama to take the lead in offering a workable plan that Republicans can accept but stopped short of providing details, saying: \u201cI don\u2019t want to limit the options available to me or limit the options that might be available to the White House.\u201d Asked if tea party conservatives or others in his caucus might oppose an agreement they don\u2019t like, Boehner responded: \u201cWhen the president and I have been able to come to an agreement, there has been no problem in getting it passed here in the House.\u201d The brewing political showdown in Washington left U.S. financial markets unconvinced the two sides would resolve their differences and come to an agreement. Analysis: Obama has limits on debt deal All three U.S. stock indexes ended the week more than 2% lower due to investor concerns about the fiscal cliff\u2019s potential impact on the sluggish economy. Markets and American business are also concerned that brinksmanship on the deficit could influence the deadline for raising the nation\u2019s debt ceiling and eventually hamper the government\u2019s ability to pay its bills. The fiscal cliff comprises two main elements: Tax cuts from the administration of President George W. Bush will expire on December 31, triggering a return to higher Clinton-era rates for everyone. In addition, $1.2 trillion in mandatory across-the-board budget cuts \u2013 known in legislative parlance as the sequester \u2013 will take effect next year unless Congress finds a way to offset that amount in the federal budget. The automatic cuts were intended to motivate legislators to work out an agreement instead of letting the sequester ever actually occur. Republican leverage weakened by election results Boehner\u2019s leverage in negotiating a deal got weakened by the election that returned Obama to the White House, broadened the Democratic majority in the Senate and slightly narrowed the Republican majority in the House. While the election resulted in another split Congress like the current session that has become a symbol of legislative dysfunction, both sides have signaled a possible new openness to an agreement that was unreachable in the past two years. In the final days of the campaign, Vice President Joe Biden referred to private talks with members of Congress on the pending fiscal impacts of expiring tax cuts and mandatory budget cuts. This week, Boehner called on Obama to work with him to complete a comprehensive deficit reduction agreement \u2013 the \u201cgrand bargain\u201d that eluded them last year. Boehner says GOP willing to compromise on fiscal cliff Both Boehner and Obama were held back from a deal back then because of pressure from their respective bases, retiring Republican Rep. Steve LaTourette of Ohio told CNN. \u201cThe \u2018no-tax pledge\u2019 people in the Republican Party yanked Boehner back and the \u2018don\u2019t you dare touch the middle class\u2019 entitlement people in the president\u2019s party pulled him back, and as a result those talks collapsed,\u201d LaTourette said. Boehner said this week that a comprehensive agreement won\u2019t happen by the end of the year in the lame-duck session of Congress. He proposed that the two sides use that time to set up a framework for substantive negotiations when the new Congress comes in next year while taking short-term steps to avoid the fiscal cliff. Durbin, the No. 2 Democrat in the chamber, said such a timetable could work. \u201cWe have a chance in the lame duck to at least start the process, and I think there\u2019s a chance to rally bipartisan support,\u201d he said. \u201cThese are basic issues we can work out, and the president is in a position to do that.\u201d Both sides agree the best outcome would be a broad deal addressing the overall need for deficit reduction, including reforms to the tax system and entitlement programs such as Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. However, they remain far apart on exactly how to forge such an agreement. Obama campaigned on having wealthy Americans contribute more to deficit reduction efforts, and White House spokesman Jay Carney said Friday that the president will veto any package that extends the Bush tax cuts for income over $250,000. \u201cWe can\u2019t just cut our way to prosperity,\u201d Obama said Friday. \u201cIf we\u2019re serious about reducing the deficit, we have to combine spending cuts with revenue and that means asking the wealthiest Americans to pay a little more in taxes.\u201d Boehner and Republicans oppose raising taxes on anyone, and instead back a broad reform of the tax system that would lower rates further for everyone while eliminating some deductions and loopholes. While Boehner said this week that his side was open to increasing revenue from such reforms, he made clear that such increases should come from resulting economic growth instead of higher tax rates. In essence, Boehner proposed the kind of tax reform championed by failed Republican presidential challenger Mitt Romney, whose plan was criticized by Obama and many economists for being unrealistic in assuming that the combination of closed loopholes and economic growth would equal the lost revenue of tax cuts. Obama\u2019s victory gives him new leverage in the budget battles after Republicans forced the president and Democrats into prolonged and sometimes bitter showdowns in the last two years. One top Democrat with close ties to leaders on Capitol Hill and the White House said that the imminent expiration of the Bush tax cuts means Obama \u201cdoesn\u2019t have to do anything and everyone\u2019s taxes go up,\u201d which is a GOP nightmare. Such an increase would affect personal income tax, the estate tax, dividends and capital gains taxes. In addition, some officials are hinting the feared sequester cuts don\u2019t have to be implemented right away in the new year, giving at least a few months for a deal to be worked out. Obama, Boehner stand ground on fiscal cliff CNN\u2019s Jessica Yellin, Ted Barrett, Joe Sterling and Allison Brennan contributed to this report.",

Check up-to-the-minute results at cnn.com/results and join our live blog at cnn.com/conversation. Need other reasons to spend Election Day with CNN? Here\u2019s our list. Six undecided voters in six key demographics in six battleground states We met them through deeply drawn profiles, photographic portraits, video and data Now, less than a day before the election, have they made up their minds? Meet The Undecided: Their choices are prized -- and personal They represent a sliver of the electorate yet could still hold the key to the Oval Office. In a contest that\u2019s already the most expensive in history, we set out to meet the men and women whose choices are so highly prized: the undecided voters. They represent six key groups in the key swing states where their votes matter most: A millennial in New Hampshire. A Catholic in Ohio. A long-term unemployed man in Nevada. A Latino in Florida. A single woman in Virginia. An evangelical in Iowa. Compare The Undecided: Artifacts that reveal identity We introduced you to them through deeply drawn profiles accompanied by photographic portraits, videos and data visualizations that illuminate the nexus between real life and politics \u2013 the emotional terrain that determines how these ordinary Americans could decide the election. With less than a day left before the election, we caught up with them to see if they\u2019ve made up their minds \u2013 and how they came to their decision. Three told whom they\u2019re voting for, two wouldn\u2019t say and one \u2013 well, she\u2019s still undecided. The Millennial: Imagining he\u2019s the candidate The last few months have been especially busy for Tyler York. He\u2019s worked 60 hours a week between his three jobs, and he welcomed two nephews into his already big, bustling family. But the 25-year-old spent a lot of time thinking about the election, too, trying to decide how to decide. He watched the debates and talked to supporters of President Barack Obama and Mitt Romney, but he wasn\u2019t satisfied with anybody\u2019s answers. \u201cPeople my age, people generations older \u2026 I\u2019ve realized that they don\u2019t truly know why they\u2019re voting for their guy,\u201d he said. \u201d \u2018You should vote for me because the other guy\u2019s bad\u2019 isn\u2019t really educating anybody on the issues.\u201d A colleague suggested this: Imagine you are the candidate. What are the issues most important to you? What is your stance? And which of the real-life candidates lines up best? Not perfectly, but best? Read York\u2019s story: \u2018What\u2019s going on? Am I really happy?\u2019 He spent hours researching the candidates\u2019 ideas on foreign policy, a subject he\u2019s passionate about after traveling overseas and making friends among the large refugee community around Manchester, New Hampshire. He read up on energy and the environment, which sparked his interest after teaching a sustainability class at a private school. He was stunned by how little information he found about education; there\u2019s a lot of talk about its importance, but no vision from candidates, he thinks. And he studied their stances on women\u2019s health, gender pay disparities and same-sex marriage. York, the undecided millennial, became York, the decided voter \u2013 but he doesn\u2019t want to say who he\u2019ll support. Sifting through so many out-of-context attacks and meme-making one-liners made him wish for clearer facts, not more noisy opinions. He still identifies as an independent and can\u2019t imagine himself volunteering for a campaign or cause in the future. The moment you do, he said, you stop listening to other sides\u2019 points of view, or everyone thinks you do. Obama and Romney are often pretty similar, he thinks. York\u2019s not so sure the divisions in politics and parties are real. It\u2019s just that loud arguments and snappy comebacks get attention. That doesn\u2019t mean it\u2019s easy for any candidate to bring people together, he said. \u201cIf it was a legitimate difference or true barrier, it would be one thing,\u201d York said. \u201cBut because it\u2019s manufactured, it feels like \u2018I\u2019m not supposed to agree with you.\u2019 \u201c York said he\u2019ll spend the days before the election talking to trusted friends and family members whose votes are going the opposite way. He\u2019s not sure they could change his mind, but he wants to listen. \u201cI want to know why they feel so strongly in that direction,\u201d he said. \u201cI hope to hear an eloquent argument of why they feel that way. \u201cI don\u2019t need to be reassured of my own opinion. It takes a lot more than watching news or reading articles (to make the decision.) Self-reflection is the most important part.\u201d He\u2019s making decisions for himself, too. By this time next year, he still expects to be working all three of his part-time jobs. He\u2019s enjoying them, so why stop? He doesn\u2019t think he\u2019ll still be living above his parents\u2019 garage, though. He plans to have a stable income for more than a year by then, and he\u2019ll have saved for a healthy down payment on a place of his own \u2013 if he decides to buy. But he\u2019s still not sure he wants to make the commitment. The Catholic: Looking for the truth Mary Roberts usually waits until she\u2019s attended rallies for both political parties to make up her mind about how she\u2019ll vote. Living in the battleground state of Ohio, she has a greater chance of doing that than most Americans \u2013 except for this year. That\u2019s because someone recently hit her car, and it was totaled. Now she attends physical therapy and needs a cane, which has left the normally active 67-year-old feeling frustrated. It\u2019s also slowed her decision-making process. \u201cI tried to go to (Ohio State University) one day since both candidates were having rallies there,\u201d Roberts says. \u201cBut I couldn\u2019t get close enough to comfortably walk. I\u2019m so disappointed.\u201d Which means, just days from this year\u2019s election, she still hasn\u2019t made up her mind. \u201cI\u2019m close, real close,\u201d she says. Instead, she must rely on the information that comes to her. Read Roberts\u2019 story: She acts in faith. Who deserves hers? \u201cLet me count,\u201d Roberts says, as she flips through her stack of mail. \u201cI\u2019ve got seven different political mailers just today.\u201d She doesn\u2019t mind the mail, nor does she mind the calls \u2013 except when there are so many they fill up her voice mail and her family can\u2019t leave a message. \u201cAnd I\u2019d love to watch a game show without the 50 political ads,\u201d she says. \u201cMy sister complains she feels neglected living in Georgia. But the ads are so negative, I tell her she\u2019s lucky.\u201d Roberts reads several newspapers to follow the campaign. She watched the debates closely. \u201cI think President Obama made a stand, finally with that second one, and I\u2019m so glad. He sounded kind of tuned out before,\u201d she says. \u201cRomney sounds wishy-washy saying one thing to one group and then one thing to another. I can\u2019t figure out some of the promises he made.\u201d Romney\u2019s disparaging comments about the poor at an earlier campaign event disturbed her. \u201cWhat kind of ignoramus thinks people want government help? Sometimes they just need it,\u201d Roberts says. \u201cMy family isn\u2019t in that 47% now, but growing up we needed help. What would we have done without it?\u201d She\u2019s still concerned, though, about the president\u2019s effectiveness. \u201cYou know, I\u2019d hoped he\u2019d make the economy better, and I do think he is sincere,\u201d Roberts says. \u201cI think he has tried to be honest with the public, but I am still not sure if he can pull us out of this mess.\u201d Several people in her Columbus circle have hoped to bring her around. Many parishioners at her church read about Roberts on CNN. One day, they surrounded her. \u201cI was coming out of Mass and a man who saw my story talked to me about why I should vote for President Obama,\u201d Roberts says. \u201cSoon a crowd gathered and people kept saying things like, \u2018I know you have heard this and that, but don\u2019t believe it. Now I\u2019m going to tell you the truth about him.\u2019 \u201cI always like when people start a sentence with, \u2018I\u2019m going to tell you the truth.\u2019 I really start to listen then. But there wasn\u2019t any Romney supporter there. I would have liked the truth about him, too.\u201d For now, Roberts will keep an open mind. She already has Election Day plans. She and a neighbor like to be there right when the polls open and then go to breakfast. She signed up to be a poll watcher, too. Later she and her family will watch the returns at a sports bar. \u201cI like the multiple TVs and can get some wings.\u201d Even if she hasn\u2019t quite made up her mind, for Roberts \u2013 who grew up secretly encouraging African-Americans in the Deep South to register to vote during the height of segregation \u2013 Election Day is still something to celebrate. The Long-Term Unemployed: Casting an enthusiastic ballot Joe Stoltz tuned in to the presidential debates listening keenly for specifics on how to improve the economy from both Obama and Romney. But in the end, it was an exchange over something that happened thousands of miles away that helped turn Stoltz from undecided voter to one who felt secure in his choice. In their second verbal tangle, Romney went after Obama by claiming that the president did not refer to the U.S. Consulate attack in the Libyan city of Benghazi as an act of terror and that the following day, he was back on the campaign trail. Obama came back strong, Stoltz says. \u201cThe suggestion that anybody in my team, whether the secretary of state, our U.N. ambassador, anybody on my team would play politics or mislead when we\u2019ve lost four of our own, governor, is offensive,\u201d Obama responded. \u201cThat\u2019s not what we do. That\u2019s not what I do as president. That\u2019s not what I do as commander in chief.\u201d It was the first time in the campaign that Stoltz saw fire in Obama. \u201cHe was forceful,\u201d Stoltz says. \u201cHe looked right at Romney and was to the point.\u201d Read Stoltz\u2019s story: He started over. Who\u2019ll restart America? Stoltz voted for Obama in 2008 because he offered hope and change. But after four years of economic gloom that left Stoltz, a flooring business owner in Reno, Nevada, without any jobs, he wants a leader. He liked that Romney brings business experience to the table, but in the end he felt Obama was the national leader he could trust. He also liked how Obama addressed the importance of education \u2013 even in the third debate which focused on foreign policy \u2013 in answering a question about America\u2019s role in the world. That was an issue high on Stoltz\u2019s list of priorities; he just started college with the help of a federal grant. \u201cThat third debate sunk it all the way in for me \u2013 since I am in school and Obama was focused on education,\u201d Stoltz says. There was one other factor that helped sell Stoltz on Obama: Bill Clinton. Stoltz, a big Clinton fan, loved that the former president was stumping for Obama. America did so well under Clinton, and if he thinks Obama\u2019s the one who will get the nation back on track, then that\u2019s worth something. \u201cHe was just so passionate about it,\u201d Stoltz says of Clinton. So after months of indecision, Stoltz drove up to Truckee Meadows Community College, where he enrolled this fall to get his own life back on track, and before his keyboarding class, he cast his ballot. Enthusiastically. The Latino Voter: Watching the debates sealed the deal For weeks, Maria Lopez Reeves had been leaning toward voting for Romney. His family values and his convention speech nearly swayed her. In July, the lifelong Democrat \u201cliked\u201d the Republican nominee\u2019s page on Facebook. In August, she told CNN she felt Obama hadn\u2019t delivered on his 2008 campaign promises. She said she was \u201clistening very attentively\u201d to what Romney had to say. But she remained undecided. In September, she heard Romney say words that stuck in her mind all the way to the voting booth. \u201cThere are 47% of the people \u2026 who are dependent upon government, who believe that they are victims, who believe that government has a responsibility to care for them, who believe that they are entitled to health care, to food, to housing, to you name it,\u201d Romney said. \u201cMy job,\u201d he continued,  \u201cis not to worry about those people. I\u2019ll never convince them that they should take personal responsibility and care for their lives.\u201d He made the comments at a private fund-raiser in Boca Raton, Florida. Reeves saw them spelled out in the closed captioning on her TV screen 180 miles away. In the living room of her rental house in Kissimmee, Florida, she watched a nightly newscast report on the now-infamous leaked video. \u201cWhen I saw him, behind closed doors, it was a private conversation,\u201d Reeves says. \u201cThe true him was there.\u201d And what she saw made her cringe. \u201cI did not like being part of the 47%. That\u2019s an insult to so many people out there,\u201d says Reeves, who relies on government disability benefits to make ends meet. \u201cPeople like me, Hispanics on disability, Social Security, retired people, military people, all kinds of people. We pay taxes on merchandise, property taxes on cars. We contribute just as much as anybody else does. We don\u2019t get that many breaks.\u201d Despite her reservations about Obama, Romney didn\u2019t seem to be looking out for her best interests, she says. Read Reeves\u2019 story: Can this Latino voter find a home? Watching the debates sealed the deal. She listened to what Obama and Romney said and also paid close attention to how they said it. A decade ago, Reeves\u2019 eardrums burst, leaving her legally deaf. At first, she relied on reading lips to understand what people said. Now, a cochlear implant helps her hear, but she still pays close attention to body language. \u201cEyes and facial expressions tell a lot,\u201d she says. \u201cYou can tell when someone\u2019s acting.\u201d To Reeves, Obama seemed sincere. \u201cI looked at Mitt and it\u2019s like he was a statue up there, a puppet going through a speech that was made for him,\u201d she says. \u201cHe just didn\u2019t seem real to me, he really didn\u2019t.\u201d Last week, on the way home from a doctor\u2019s appointment, Reeves stopped by a library in Celebration, Florida, to cast her ballot during early voting. She no longer had any doubts about which candidate she supported, or which candidate would support her. \u201cIt\u2019s too scary,\u201d she says, \u201ctoo risky, letting someone like Romney take over.\u201d Reeves says she voted for Obama. The Single Woman: Staying true to her word Unmarried women make up one of America\u2019s fastest-growing demographics. They account for a quarter of the voting population, and a disproportionate number of them live in Alexandria, Virginia \u2013 a city in one of the highly coveted swing states. For all these reasons, Alexandria\u2019s unmarried and undecided Laura Palmer, 36, became a clamored-for commodity this election season. But the former lawyer, who served in 2008 as a political appointee to the Bush administration, has made it her mission to rise above conflict, focus on positivity and be true to herself. Now a licensed hypnotherapist and practitioner of energy medicine, she believes it\u2019s time for the country\u2019s leaders to do the same. She stayed mum about whom she voted for in 2008 and vowed she wouldn\u2019t divulge her decision this year. She\u2019s staying true to her word; not even her closest friends will know who\u2019s earned her ballot. \u201cI don\u2019t think it matters,\u201d says Palmer, who made her choice after the debates. \u201cI don\u2019t mean that my vote doesn\u2019t matter. Every vote counts.\u201d Read Palmer\u2019s story: Searching for a \u2018centered\u2019 candidate But in her view, there\u2019s nothing that can be accomplished in discussing such a personal choice. While the passions of a heated political season may have driven people apart, she\u2019d rather focus on the future and what might be possible \u2013 not just for the president, no matter who wins, but for those taking office in Congress. \u201cI hope whoever stays in power or moves into power, however it plays out, I hope there will be tremendous effort to reach across the aisle,\u201d she said. \u201cI hope they make an effort to work together. It\u2019s the only way our country can move forward in a meaningful way.\u201d The Evangelical: Finding his decision in the Bible Rob Seyler, a Bible school teacher who typically votes Republican, was wary of backing a Mormon for president. Seyler had thought about staying home on Election Day but says studying the Bible suggested that was a bad idea. \u201cGod would not support his people taking a passive role in a nation\u2019s government,\u201d he said by e-mail from just outside Des Moines, Iowa. \u201cIn fact, Hosea 8:4 shows that God was at times displeased with Israel\u2019s choices for leadership \u2013 which shows me that he holds his people responsible for electing proper leaders.\u201d Seyler is still wary of giving a Mormon such a prominent perch. But he thinks Romney, a lifelong member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, will \u201cmove our country in a direction that God would favor.\u201d Read Seyler\u2019s story: Radical for Jesus, dubious of Romney That\u2019s especially true when it comes to opposing abortion and same-sex marriage, two issues at the top of Seyler\u2019s list of political causes. Though the teacher caused a stir at his Baptist high school by painting Obama\u2019s silhouette onto his classroom wall, Seyler is disappointed the president hasn\u2019t done more to stop abortion and that he personally came out for legalized same-sex marriage. Romney once supported abortion rights and gay rights but has become rigorously anti-abortion and anti-gay marriage in the last decade. Seyler watched the first presidential debate and was impressed by Romney\u2019s performance. But the teacher\u2019s decision to vote for the Republican nominee was more a result of \u201ccontemplation, study and prayer.\u201d Seyler says the process made him realize that Obama talks like a Christian but that his take on issues such as abortion and marriage run counter to Seyler\u2019s read on the Bible. \u201cUltimately, I think talk is cheap,\u201d Seyler says, before citing Scripture again. \u201cJames and 1 John say that faith should be evidenced by action. And his actions do not clearly demonstrate a legitimate Christian faith.\u201d \u201cIn essence,\u201d Seyler wound up reasoning, \u201cI am choosing between two non-Christians.\u201d Seyler also recognizes the limits of his choice. America\u2019s strength is more about the nation\u2019s moral and spiritual state, he says, over which the commander in chief has only so much sway. That gives him hope for the country\u2019s ability to move forward after a deeply divided election. \u201cUltimately, no politician will ever truly solve our problems, he says. \u201cWhile we elect and support men to lead our country, we must realize that these politicians are only stewards of the world God has created and is sovereign over.\u201d Facebook insights: Breaking down the conversation CNN\u2019s Jamie Gumbrecht, Jen Christensen, Moni Basu, Catherine E.

ANALYSIS: Both Romney and Obama have been unable to break through to unite voters Romney has been trying to recover from being pulled from the right early in the campaign Obama has seemed like an unwilling participant in his own re-election When the race is done, the balloons have wilted, and the confetti has been swept up, Campaign 2012 may be marked more by its failures than its triumphs. But here\u2019s the starkest failure in these final days before the vote: Neither candidate has made a convincing enough argument for his presidency to break free of the margin of error in the polls. No matter who is elected, close to as many Americans will have voted against him as for him. Sure, Barack Obama has generally stayed a point or two ahead of his rival in most battlegrounds, but despite his mighty pushes and the advantage of the bully pulpit he has rarely done any better. And Mitt Romney, while he has managed to relentlessly nip at the president\u2019s heels like a dog chasing a car (as opposed to one riding on top), he has never been able to decisively bridge the gap from \u201calso ran\u201d to \u201cfront runner.\u201d Mad dash in final bid for votes The most recent CNN Poll of Polls \u2013 an average of 10 national polls \u2013 has Obama just one point ahead of Romney, 48%-47%. The latest CNN/ORC survey in the battleground state of Ohio has Obama up 50%-47%, and in Florida by just one point, 50%-49%. Both results are well within the polls\u2019 margin of error of plus or minus 3.5%. And if both parties are not haunted by the ever-growing mob of voters calling themselves independents, they ought to be. At least Dr. Rita Kirk at Southern Methodist University thinks so. She is director of the Maguire Center for Ethics and Public Responsibility. \u201cIndependent isn\u2019t a party,\u201d she says. \u201cIt just means \u2018none of the above.\u2019 People are not really satisfied with either party.\u201d Romney\u2019s difficulties in breaking through the margin of error have been well documented: a slow start that allowed the White House to paint his strongest positive, his business experience, as a negative; a clumsy trip overseas; and more than one stumble that helped build the caricature of an out-of-touch fat cat. Note to future campaigners: Working class folks have a little trouble relating to a guy who proposes $10,000 bets. Being pulled from the rightBut perhaps a deeper part of Romney\u2019s trouble dates back to Obama\u2019s single biggest humiliation since taking office. Two years ago this month, Republicans ripped control of the House of Representatives from the Democrats, seized new ground in the Senate, and captured 10 extra governorships in what appeared to be a resounding rejection of the White House agenda. A subdued Obama called it a \u201cshellacking,\u201d admitting in a masterpiece of understatement, \u201cSome election nights are more fun than others.\u201d If Romney wins\u2026Romney: My vision for America The Republican charge up Capitol Hill, however, was not led by party purists. The flags of the tea party waved high over the Democratic trouncing, and created a whole new road for GOP presidential hopefuls such as Romney. The uncompromising tea partiers made it clear they would get behind only someone who paid the toll of a hard and unmistakable turn to the right, especially on fiscal matters. And as Kirk puts it, \u201cA candidate (who makes that turn) stands very little chance of getting back to the center in time for the general election.\u201d Was he ever \u2018severely conservative\u2019 enough?Romney was always an awkward fit. He had a hard time embracing the far right with enthusiasm, and the right felt the same about him. That is one reason why the nomination process dragged on so long, as the faithful tried to make it work with Rick Perry, Herman Cain, Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum. But Romney was not just wrestling with philosophical differences. \u201cSomething else that pulls candidates away from the middle is money,\u201d says assistant professor Georgia Kernell at Northwestern University\u2019s Department of Political Science, where she is a fellow in The Institute for Policy Research. She notes that Romney\u2019s now infamous \u201c47 percent\u201d comment was almost certainly spurred by the need to appeal to right-wing donors at that fundraiser. \u201cHe didn\u2019t have to say it,\u201d Kernell says, \u201cbut it certainly made (his message) more powerful.\u201d The same might be said about candidate Barack Obama\u2019s similar stumble four years ago when he privately told donors that rural voters \u201ccling to their guns or religion.\u201d Kernell believes the Republican nominee, all things considered, has walked the tightrope well. \u201cI actually think Romney did a great job using the first debate to position himself back in the middle.\u201d It all came at a price. His vacillation between the right and center has allowed Team Obama to pelt him with accusations of flip-flopping and a schizophrenic candidacy, leaving Romney unable to crawl out of the margin-of-error trench. Crowley: It\u2019s the losing campaigns I remember most How history will judge Obama Romney's strategy to win Ohio Pre-election jobs report spin A president marginalizedObama did not have to tack nearly as far left as he would have if he were fighting other Democrats for the nomination this year, and undeniably he had some accomplishments to carry into the election. Health care reform was upheld by the Supreme Court. The war in Iraq was concluded and Afghanistan is winding down. As Vice President Joe Biden loves to say, because of Barack Obama, \u201cOsama Bin Laden is dead, and General Motors is alive.\u201d Despite all that, the president, too, has spent the campaign in a marginal spot, right alongside Romney. His enemy is the economy, or as Kernell puts it, \u201cUnemployment hasn\u2019t gone down;\u201d at least not down to the 5% range Obama himself promised early in his term when he was touting the stimulus. Most voters have been willing to blame the legacy of the Bush years, and the president has encouraged that thinking at every juncture, reminding anyone who will listen that he inherited the worst recession since the Great Depression. An unwilling participant in his own reelectionBut his reelection team clearly knew \u201cIt could be worse\u201d was not much of a campaign slogan, so over the summer they steadily shifted to a divide-and-conquer strategy. Gone is \u201cNo Drama Obama\u201d \u2013 the apparently easygoing man who went into the White House promising to bring warring political parties to the table of peace and prosperity. In his place is a much tougher talking candidate who misses no chance to savage the Republicans, to ridicule Romney as a \u201cbull****er,\u201d and like his opponent, to bend the truth until it breaks. \u201cThey\u2019re ignoring the fact checkers,\u201d Kirk says of both Obama and Romney. If Obama wins\u2026Obama: My vision for America The president, clearly much happier preaching Hope and Change in 2008, has seemed at times an unwilling participant in his own reelection. At the Democratic Convention, critics widely saw Bill Clinton\u2019s speech as superior, Joe Biden\u2019s as more passionate, and the president\u2019s as acceptable at best. The first debate with Romney brought even more concern for Democrats. President Obama sat looking down much of the time and seemed alternately angry, bored, or disengaged. His showing was so lackluster even faithful fans wondered whether he really wanted the White House anymore. Perhaps that is why he too, aside from one brief surge in August, has been unable to establish a commanding lead. Despite his consistently strong personal popularity, he\u2019s had to cling for his political life to every vote he can scrape up within the margin of error. Opinion: What\u2019s really at stake in election 2012 More money, less unityNeither candidate can say his deadlocked fate in the polls is because people have not heard his message. No other election has ever seen so much money raised and spent to win the White House \u2013 latest estimates have the 2012 campaign costing, all in, as much as $6 billion. All those ads, all those TV interviews with the candidates and their surrogates, all the debates and bus trips. They\u2019ve each had their chances to break out over and over again. Yet neither has been able to get the job done. They may have, however, accomplished another task. Although they each gave lip service to the idea of us all being in this together, the divisiveness of the race itself seems to have hardened opinions even more in red and blue America. In the end, it remains to be seen if there will be a president of the United States. With trust at a low, paranoia grows Sure, someone will win the office, but arguably both campaigns have done all they can to make sure the country will be anything but united. If Obama wins, the stalwarts of red America may hunker down in their \u201cbitterness,\u201d simply enduring the next four years while awaiting the next chance to storm the castle. If Romney wins, the faithful of blue America may feed on their fury and do to the other party\u2019s president exactly what they accuse Republicans of doing to theirs; obstructing his every plan. Kernell likes to think not. She believes the very political partisans who\u2019ve helped lead the country to this point may lead it back to more conciliatory days, if only for cynical reasons. \u201cThe economy is going to turn around,\u201d she says, \u201cand they\u2019re all going to want to claim some responsibility.\u201d Kirk, however, believes those better days may be a longer time coming. \u201cI think leadership will emerge. I just don\u2019t think it has yet.\u201d Maybe, she suggests, the candidates once had ideas of a great, unifying moment \u2013 of a nation coming together to confront its common issues in this campaign, but along the way those dreams were lost in the margins.",

Obama stumped in New Hampshire in the morning, flew to Florida and Ohio, and was headed west to Colorado in the evening. Romney spent Sunday heading east from Iowa to Virginia, with a stop in Ohio and a foray into Pennsylvania in between. Along the way, Obama painted Tuesday\u2019s vote as a choice between policies that had moved the country out of the depths of recession and ones that got it into one in the first place. \u201cOn the one hand, you can choose to return to the top-down policies that crashed our economy,\u201d Obama told supporters in Hollywood, Florida, north of Miami. \u201cOr you can join me in building a future that focuses on a strong and growing middle class.\u201d Stumping with former President Bill Clinton in Concord, New Hampshire, he said Romney is trying \u201cto repackage the same old ideas and pretend they\u2019re new.\u201d Boehner very confident on Romney in Ohio 538 votes will decide the election Courting the women's vote How history will judge Obama \u201cWe know what change looks like, and what he\u2019s selling ain\u2019t it. It ain\u2019t it,\u201d Obama said. In Cincinnati, the president vowed to win Ohio and the nation\u2019s highest office, \u201cone more time.\u201d Campaign spokeswoman Jen Psaki said the president was \u201creflective\u201d and \u201cnostalgic\u201d working the crowds. \u201cHe\u2019s enjoying himself,\u201d Psaki said, adding, \u201cHe\u2019s taking in every moment.\u201d New national poll: It\u2019s all tied up In Des Moines, Iowa, and Cleveland, Romney told voters that Obama\u2019s record, particularly on the economy, didn\u2019t warrant returning him to Washington. \u201cThroughout this campaign, using everything he can think of, President Obama has tried to convince you his last four years have been a success,\u201d Romney told a rally in Cleveland. \u201cSo his plan for the next four years is to take all the ideas from his first term \u2013 the borrowing, Obamacare and all the rest \u2013 and do them all over again. He calls his plan \u2018forward\u2019. I call it forewarned.\u201d In Des Moines, Romney said that would mean \u201ccontinued, crippling unemployment. It means stagnant take-home pay. It means depressed home values and a devastated military. \u201cUnless we change course, we may be looking at another recession,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re only two days away from a very different path, from a fresh start.\u201d While tn Newport News, Virginia, Romney urged supporters to look beyond rhetoric, to the candidates\u2019 records. \u201cYou see, talk is cheap, but a record it\u2019s earned,\u201d he said. \u201cChange can\u2019t be measured in speeches; change is measured in achievements.\u201d National polls show the race locked in a virtual dead heat, or tied. A new CNN poll showed 49% support for Obama, and 49% for Romney. A Politico/George Washington University survey has it tied at 48%; an NBC News/Wall Street Journal poll indicates Obama at 48% and Romney at 47%; and the latest ABC News/Washington Post tracking poll puts Obama at 49% and Romney at 48%. In response to the numbers, a senior official with the Obama campaign said his team is confident in its \u201cground game.\u201d \u201cWould rather be us than them,\u201d the official said. Romney\u2019s next stop was in Pennsylvania \u2013 a state most published polls show leaning Democratic. But Romney\u2019s running mate, Wisconsin congressman Paul Ryan, made a stop there Saturday, and Romney was headed for the Philadelphia suburbs Sunday evening. Is Pennsylvania really in play? Romney adviser Kevin Madden told reporters on the campaign plane Sunday that Obama is \u201cunder-performing\u201d in Pennsylvania, \u201cand it\u2019s presented us an opportunity.\u201d Deja vu on the campaign trail Dueling campaign phone banks In Ohio The Jewish vote In Florida Calculating who will win the presidency \u201cWe have a really strong volunteer infrastructure that we think could make a difference,\u201d Madden added. \u201cAnd that\u2019s why we\u2019re traveling there with two days to go, and we have spent a lot of time in the last few weeks concentrating on expanding the map.\u201d The Obama campaign discounted Romney\u2019s chances of reclaiming Pennsylvania, which hasn\u2019t gone for a Republican presidential candidate since 1988. Psaki compared the GOP effort to \u201cclimbing Mount Everest without a guide, without a map and without support staff.\u201d But she added, \u201cWe\u2019re not taking a single vote for granted,\u201d and Clinton will be campaigning all over the state on Obama\u2019s behalf. Obama\u2019s running mate, Vice President Joe Biden, visited Cleveland on Sunday. He told a crowd at a high school that Romney and his running mate, Paul Ryan, are \u201crunning away from what they\u2019ve stood for the last decade faster than you can imagine.\u201d \u201cBut like a little kid, they can\u2019t run away from their shadow until the sun goes down,\u201d Biden said. \u201cIt\u2019s going down Tuesday.\u201d Ryan started his day with a brief appearance at Lambeau Field, where he tailgated with fellow Green Bay Packers fans ahead of the team\u2019s 31-17 win over the Arizona Cardinals. He left before kickoff for Mansfield, Ohio, where he focused on shuttered auto plants and defense cuts in a state where Romney\u2019s opposition to the 2008 federal auto bailout of the U.S. auto industry has hurt the GOP. Mansfield was home to plant that made body parts for General Motors before the company\u2019s restructuring, when it was shut down. \u201cIt\u2019s not going the right way in some places in America, and you know what it doesn\u2019t have to be like this. We don\u2019t have to settle for this,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cThis may be the best that President Obama can do, but it is not the best that America can do.\u201d CNN Election Calculator: You do the math The polling numbers are slightly different in the battlegrounds, where Obama holds a small edge in more states than Romney. But most of those leads are well within the polls\u2019 sampling errors. Obama ends his blitz Monday with three rallies with rocker Bruce Springsteen in Madison, Wisconsin; Columbus, Ohio, where he\u2019ll be joined by rapper Jay-Z; and Des Moines, Iowa. First lady Michelle Obama will introduce the president to a crowd in Iowa, where Obama\u2019s 2008 Democratic campaign took off with a surprise win in the caucuses there. The couple then will head to Chicago, where they\u2019ll spend Election Day. Romney\u2019s other stops include Sanford, Florida; Lynchburg and Fairfax, Virginia; Columbus, Ohio; and a finish in Manchester, New Hampshire, before making the short trip to Boston, where he\u2019ll spend Election Day.

            "article_content": "Monday's debate in Florida did little to radically alter the shape of the  presidential race Trend lines in several key states are favoring Romney Both campaigns are seeing the race narrow in some Midwestern states A dramatic new consensus has taken hold inside the campaigns of President Obama and Mitt Romney, one that was unthinkable just a few weeks ago: Americans will wake up on Election Day not knowing who their next president will be. Polls have tightened, with trend lines in several key states favoring Romney, and Monday\u2019s foreign policy debate in Florida doing little to radically alter the shape of the race. Romney spent much of the year working to shore up his conservative flank. But now, buoyed by his vigorous first debate performance, he plans to spend the remainder of the campaign visiting swing precincts where both campaigns are competing for a diminishing slice of undecided or persuadable suburban women. Obama campaign officials now privately acknowledge that North Carolina, a state they can afford to lose, is moving perilously out of reach. Polling shows Florida also moving slightly toward Romney, but few in either camp believe the Republican nominee has more than a 1- or 2-percentage-point edge here. Five things we learned in the final debate CNN Election Express tours swing states Cutter: 'Absolutely not' conceding Fla. Final debate between Obama, Romney Both campaigns consider Virginia and Colorado tight. New Hampshire is now a jump ball, and the Romney campaign is making a last-minute investment on expensive Boston area television ads in an attempt to turn the state red. The president\u2019s re-election chances increasingly hinge on a \u201cBig Ten\u201d firewall of Iowa, Wisconsin and, most importantly, Ohio \u2013 a state where Romney has been stymied by his opposition to the federal auto bailout and a concentrated effort by Obama forces to portray the former private equity whiz as out of touch with the middle class. The Obama campaign is highlighting polls showing robust leads in early voting and absentee balloting in Iowa and Ohio, but Republicans have worked to close the wide early voting gap that helped drive Obama\u2019s victory in 2008. Still, both campaigns are seeing the race narrow in those Midwestern states, which just weeks ago were thought to be firmly in Obama\u2019s grasp. Even some Democrats admit that, for the moment, the momentum is on Romney\u2019s side. \u201cWhat is holding the president back is voters still don\u2019t know what he is going to do early next year to get this economy going,\u201d Democratic pollster Celinda Lake said. \u201cThere is still time for him to do that, because the economy is the No. 1 thing people are paying attention to.\u201d The president is working to correct that, launching a fresh effort Tuesday to define his second-term vision with a new minute-long television ad airing in all the key battlegrounds. Romney aides, who have been gripped by an unfamiliar feeling of optimism and excitement since the first debate, say it\u2019s too late for the president to reinvent himself. \u201cThe president being at 46, 47%, that would scare the crap out of me if I\u2019m the incumbent,\u201d Romney adviser Russ Schriefer said of the president\u2019s approval rating, which has recently hovered just below 50%. Romney\u2019s latest campaign theme \u2013 that he is a firm and resolute leader with a clear plan to fix a rudderless economy \u2013 infuriates Obama advisers, who scoff at the idea that someone who has veered wildly from message to message throughout his campaign is suddenly a more trustworthy option than the president. But Republicans outside the campaign say Romney has finally put his finger on a credible message at precisely the right moment. Analysis: Obama didn\u2019t score knockout but landed more punches \u201cIf the election were held today, I think Obama might squeak out a win, but he is now playing defense and running a very small campaign,\u201d said Steve Duprey, a Republican power player in New Hampshire who advised John McCain\u2019s presidential campaign. \u201cContrast that with Romney, who sounds optimistic and sunny. People like to see someone who has momentum and see someone who has positive, sunny rhetoric.\u201d Talk has percolated in Romney-world that a late advertising push might be possible in Democratic-leaning Michigan and Pennsylvania, where Obama has long been considered safe. One high-ranking Romney official, granted anonymity to speak frankly about campaign tactics, admitted that Michigan is probably off the table because Democrats \u201chave done such a job of sticking a knife in us on the auto bailout.\u201d But Pennsylvania, with 20 electoral votes and no early voting, remains an intriguing smash-and-grab possibility for Romney media buyers if the polls there remain within the margin of error the week before Election Day. Democrats call that talk nothing more than a head fake \u2013 Obama campaign manager Jim Messina answered with a flat \u201cno\u201d when asked if Pennsylvania is a battleground state \u2013 but the Romney campaign and the Republican National Committee have kept more than 60 staffers in the state since last spring. The Obama team insists it always knew the contest was going to tighten in its final stage, though it\u2019s commonly acknowledged among Democrats that the president\u2019s dismal first debate showing was a colossal self-inflicted wound. Despite the avalanche of ads currently swamping television airwaves, the race will now be decided by the \u201cground game,\u201d a fundamental but often little-understood aspect of campaigns focused on the mechanics of voter identification, persuasion and turnout. Despite Republican advances since 2008 in field work and early voting, which started in Iowa in late September and is under way in five other swing states, few in either party question the supremacy of the Obama ground operation. Obama supporters say their early investments in staff and field offices in key battlegrounds \u2013 the campaign has been deeply embedded in Ohio, where it has over 130 offices, since the epic Democratic primary fight of 2008 \u2013 will carry the day in November. \u201cWe think we are going to do a terrific job on turnout,\u201d said Obama adviser David Plouffe. \u201cYou can find any poll you want out there to fit your judgment on the race, but the president has had a very strong position in these battleground states. We still think we have a more credible pathway to 50% in Florida than Gov. Romney does. We certainly feel that way in Virginia, in Ohio, in Nevada, in Iowa, in New Hampshire. Even in North Carolina.\u201d The razor\u2019s-edge race presents an opportunity for the Obama campaign to validate its long-held theory that a superior field operation combined with subtle demographic shifts in the electorate will provide a cushion for the president. Florida, with more than 11 million registered voters, is a proving ground for that hypothesis. In the last four years, the number of registered Hispanic voters in Florida has jumped by almost 200,000, and more of them have registered as Democrats than Republicans. The number of African-American voters has also ticked up by a few points. At the same time, the share of white voters has dipped slightly. Those are all favorable shifts for the Obama campaign. What questions were not answered in the debate? Obama advisers in Florida see the Orlando area in particular, with its burgeoning Puerto Rican population that leans Democratic, as fertile hunting ground once early voting begins on Saturday. If the campaign can increase the share of Hispanic vote on Election Day to 15% of the vote, slightly up from 13% in 2008, it believes that winning about two-thirds of those voters might be enough to offset modest losses among white voters or independents. It\u2019s a tightrope walk, but one the Obama campaign has been preparing for since 2009, particularly in states with growing Hispanic populations like Florida, Nevada and Colorado. Republicans, meanwhile, are hoping that an autumn burst of grass-roots enthusiasm will help them overcome their comparatively late start in the field. Though the Republican National Committee began laying some early groundwork in key states, the party was not able to fully build out a national get-out-the-vote operation until Romney sewed up the nomination last spring. Romney\u2019s ground effort is built on a fleet of battleground state \u201cVictory Offices,\u201d funded and staffed, in part, by the RNC. While the presidency is the top prize this fall, the GOP Victory effort is not Romney\u2019s domain alone \u2013 it\u2019s also providing the backbone for key Senate, House and gubernatorial campaigns. The Obama operation, meanwhile, is devoted solely to re-electing the president, and in most of the pivotal states it has more than twice as many field offices as the Republicans. Both campaigns are leveraging new technological advancements and sophisticated algorithms to identify and turn out their supporters in the final weeks of the race. They are narrowly targeting their online ads, using cookies, tapping into social networks online to mine personal information, and using iPads for data entry during neighborhood walks. But the Obama and Romney teams are also betting on strikingly different field models. Early October visits to Republican Victory offices in central Virginia illustrated both opportunities and challenges for Romney. Republican enthusiasm was not in question. On a Saturday morning in Henrico and Chesterfield counties, Romney volunteers were streaming in to field offices, signing up for three-hour shifts to make phone calls or knock on doors to identify potential Romney supporters. The Republican ground effort in Virginia has knocked on almost 1.2 million doors in the commonwealth to date, 12 times as many as it hit in 2008. Academic studies and field experiments have shown that in-person visits are the most effective form of voter contact, more so than direct mail or phone calls. Volunteers were calling potential supporters, using predictive dialer phones that sent data directly back to the RNC\u2019s voter database, which is constantly being refined and examined by microtargeting gurus as the party learns more about the different universes of voters in each key state. After reaching a voter on the phone, a GOP volunteer would read from a script to determine if that person was supporting Romney or Obama, or if he or she was undecided. Volunteers punched the answers into the phone\u2019s keypad during the conversation, adding the latest information to the party\u2019s voter list, before hanging up. The phone system would then automatically dial a new voter. The Victory Office phone calls are only reaching landlines and not cell phones, two GOP sources told CNN. Republicans have a similar structure in place across the political battlefield, and they have touted a record-breaking number of door-knocks and phone calls made this cycle. But Democrats say the numbers are inflated, in part because automated messages left on answering machines are being counted as voter contacts. Zakaria: Is it a debate when the candidates agree? Along with its door-to-door efforts, the Obama campaign in Ohio is making calls in a more traditional fashion, working off a call sheet and writing down information about voters as it comes in. Voter data is manually entered into the campaign\u2019s database each evening. It\u2019s a more labor-intensive method, but campaign officials say it allows them to have a more nuanced understanding of the voters they are trying to persuade and mobilize. While the Obama campaign has field offices in nearly every corner of every battleground state, organizers say they have even deeper roots than the Romney campaign because of their neighborhood team model, in which local volunteers are empowered with leadership roles in their communities. Also working in Obama\u2019s favor on the ground, albeit counterintuitively: the 2010 Citizens United vs. Federal Election Commission ruling that loosened campaign finance restrictions. The Supreme Court decision has drawn scorn from liberals and pundits who say conservative groups now have an outsize voice in campaigns, but the ruling also opened the door for organized labor to target all voters, not just traditional union members. The AFL-CIO has been registering and persuading voters in labor-friendly states like Ohio, Wisconsin and Nevada throughout the year. Labor officials are now refocusing their efforts on turnout. Mike Podhorzer, the AFL-CIO\u2019s political director, said that recent high-profile battles over labor in the Midwest \u2013 namely the 2011 repeal of a restrictive collective bargaining bill in Ohio and the unsuccessful recall attempt of Gov. Scott Walker earlier this year in Wisconsin \u2013 gave union organizers a chance to \u201croad test\u201d their field strategies before the presidential election. \u201cWe were able to mobilize,\u201d Podhorzer said. \u201cIt was an opportunity for us for test and implement a number of programs which were very valuable.\u201d The final sprint of the campaign",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: The 2012 presidential race is CNN Chief National Correspondent John King\u2019s seventh campaign. King is traveling through battleground states, where the election will be decided, to find the voters who will determine whether President Barack Obama gets a second term or if the country needs the change in direction that Mitt Romney represents. Undecided moms in Ohio say Mitt Romney's '47%' comments hit home hard Barack Obama leads Romney among white women in Ohio 52%-46% Pollster says Walmart moms matter because they have swung back and forth over time \"It would have to be something big\" to get one Ohio mom back on Romney's side The clock on the mantle has ticked past midnight, but Jessica Lundgren is studying \u2013 so she can\u2019t afford to think about sleep just yet. \u201cI\u2019m a single mom to a 5-year-old girl who is fantastic,\u201d Lundgren told CNN this week. \u201cI work full-time and go to school full-time. So my day usually starts around 4:45 a.m. and ends close to 1 a.m.\u201d She works at a call center and is studying to be a medical assistant. Long, hard days, but no complaints.  \u201cYou do what you have to do in this economy,\u201d Lundgren said. \u201cYou do what you have to to further yourself.\u201d A few months back, Lundgren was invited to a focus group of \u201cWalmart moms\u201d and said she was leaning toward voting for Republican Mitt Romney. But she is undecided now, and Romney has only himself to blame. \u201cThe main thing is because of some of the ads that are coming out,\u201d Lundgren said. \u201cThe one that sticks out the most is the ad where he was talking \u2013 they had some audio of him about the 47%, you know, \u2018I can\u2019t really worry about them.\u2019\u201d Romney on 47% comments: I was \u2018completely wrong\u2019 \u201cHow can you put your faith and trust in a candidate that doesn\u2019t care about everybody?\u201d A new CNN-ORC International Poll shows Romney back in the hunt in Ohio; President Barack Obama leads among likely voters - 51%-47%, but that is within the poll\u2019s margin of error. Four weeks out, the candidates are tied in the suburbs, tied among independents and tied among voters age 50 and older. National polls indicate dead heat in Obama-Romney battle And Romney has a big lead among white men, a necessary ingredient to a Republican Ohio victory. Romney needs support from white women Romney responds to 47% comment Obama & Romney battle for Ohio Obama and Romney battle for swing states But if there is a warning sign in the new data, it is this: Among white women, the president leads 52%-46%. Back in 2008 when Obama carried Ohio, he received 47% of votes from white women. Lundgren is no fan of Obama, so Romney still has a chance as she sorts through the barrage of campaign ads that leave her confused. \u201cIt\u2019s kind of like picking the lesser of two evils,\u201d Lundgren says. \u201cKind of \u2013 which devil do you want?\u201d White women are the battleground within the battleground. Undecideds: What will sway them? \u201cThese women matter because we have seen them prove to be swing voters over the years,\u201d says Margie Omero, a Democratic pollster who for the past several years has been part of a bipartisan study of Walmart moms \u2013 defined as working mothers with children under 18 who have shopped at the retailer at least once in the past month. \u201cIn 2008, they voted for Obama. In early 2010, they were a little bit more divided. By November 2010, they were decidedly Republican.\u201d Sarah Minto is among the converts. She was an Obama 2008 voter but now volunteers three days a week for the Ohio Romney campaign. \u201cMy mind changed when I started paying attention to the deficit and how long it kept going and how many jobs are being taken away,\u201d Minto said during a break from neighborhood canvassing for Romney in Columbus. Of her 2008 choice, she now says: \u201cHe let me down. I was very, very hopeful he would be the guy to turn everything around in America and make everything better. He just \u2013 his words were empty.\u201d CNN Money: A snapshot of Obama\u2019s economy Omero says other moms are not so sure of their presidential choice and share common concerns. \u201cTheir biggest question is how are the next four years really going to help me and my everyday family,\u201d Omero said in an interview. \u201cThey are worried about putting food on the table. Raising kids who are happy and healthy. Who are going to have a good future. Who are going to graduate into an economy where they can find a job. So they\u2019re thinking about all that and they\u2019re looking for a candidate who can understand that.\u201d Sharon Wiseman isn\u2019t sure Romney understands. And, again, he has only himself to blame. \u201cThe one \u201947%\u2019 audio that we all heard \u2013 I feel like he is not in touch with the common person, like the average middle-class person,\u201d Wiseman told us during a visit to her home in the Columbus suburb of Reynoldsburg. Wiseman describes herself as a Christian conservative and a 2008 John McCain voter. But the 47% remark turned her from undecided to strongly leaning toward voting for the president. It hit home because her husband, Ray, was out of work for a bit and the family received some help from the government during that time. CNN Money: Deficit tops $1 trillion for 4th straight year \u201cI feel like he is out of touch with what everybody is going through, \u201d Wiseman said. \u201cOhio was one of the hardest places hit. My reaction to what he said is: \u2018That\u2019s me. He\u2019s talking about me.\u2019\u201d Top Romney advisers acknowledge the \u201c47%\u201d remark as one of those rare breakthrough moments in today\u2019s cluttered politics. Romney clearly hopes the sting fades as the debates continue and the election nears, but his advisers also expect the Obama campaign will continue to use it as a weapon. Some Ohio Republicans suggest a television ad featuring Ann Romney targeted directly at those women with doubts. But it isn\u2019t just one Romney remark. The first debate also pushed Wiseman a bit more into the president\u2019s camp. Of Romney\u2019s performance she said: \u201cIt seemed like he won and traditionally it was a win. But I felt he came across kind of smug, a little on the arrogant side to me.\u201d Still, she promises to tune into the remaining two presidential debates. She gives Romney credit for recently saying he was wrong to speak as he did at the now infamous 47% fundraiser and says she might be swayed if he makes a stronger case for his economic approach in the remaining weeks. \u201cIt would have to be something big,\u201d Wiseman said. \u201cBut I am still going to be open-minded until voting.\u201d Jessica Lundgren also will be following the remaining debates and trying to sort truth from spin from the barrage of campaigns ads \u2013 $20 million in Ohio in the presidential race in just the past two weeks. \u201cThere are so many negative ads going back and forth so it is kind of hard,\u201d Lundgren said. \u201cThis is my daughter\u2019s future, not so much mine.  So that is the hard part. I feel like I am making a decision for her as well, not just myself.\u201d Poll: Romney advantage in Florida In Ohio, Romney, Ryan cast Obama as soft on China Where they stand: Candidates and issues Complete coverage: 2012 presidential debates CNN polling center",

Ryan sat down for an exclusive interview with CNN to give some insight into how he is getting ready for his 90-minute face-off. As he held the bulging briefcase in his lap, he told us that this is the way he has gotten ready for moments large and small his whole life: intense study. Advice from Palin? Ryan says, 'Sure' VP debates often have been heated Pressure on Biden and Ryan in debate What to expect in the Biden-Ryan debate \u201cI do a lot of reading, that\u2019s what I\u2019ve always done \u2013 briefings and reading,\u201d Ryan said. We asked Ryan about what one of his hunting partners told us about how he prepares to go after his prey, usually deer. The friend said that before Ryan goes hunting he washes his clothes in unscented detergent, takes a shower with unscented soap and sprays unscented material on his boots \u2013 all steps that hunters are known to take generally, but Ryan takes it to a completely different level. Photos: From the campaign trail \u201cIf you\u2019re into archery and bow hunting, that\u2019s the way to do it and be successful. I like the strategy of bow hunting and it takes a lot of preparation and I do take it seriously because I am much more successful if I do things properly and prepare the right way,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cI have always just believed that if you\u2019re going to do something, do it well.\u201d How does Ryan\u2019s hunting prep mirror his debate prep? \u201cThis stage is kind of new for me and I\u2019m taking it very seriously,\u201d he replied. \u201cI\u2019m just doing my homework and studying the issues and I\u2019ll know he\u2019ll come and attack us.  The problem he has is he has Barack Obama\u2019s record to run on.\u201d Will nervous tics fell VP candidates? Talk to anyone who knows Ryan well and they will use one word to describe him more than any other: prepared. Ryan\u2019s older brother Tobin has been helping with his political career since he began his first congressional campaign in 1997 at age 27. He said Ryan has a \u201cvery heavy hand\u201d in everything he does, and he has always been meticulous. Tobin Ryan laughs at the huge stack of briefing papers Ryan carries around now \u2013 a far cry from the way it was back in 1998 when he helped his brother get ready for his first debate as a candidate for Congress. \u201cI think we had about eight sheets of one-sided paper that listed out issues. I didn\u2019t really have to prepare Paul. It\u2019s never been an issue. This is a guy who absorbs more in a day than I think is humanly possible,\u201d Tobin Ryan said. Steve King has been a close friend and political supporter since Ryan\u2019s first congressional run. He said Ryan, who sleeps on a cot in his congressional office in Washington, is known to be up studying briefing papers so late he often falls asleep face-first at his desk. Inside Biden\u2019s debate preparations Debate prep partner \u2018immersed himself into being Joe Biden\u2019 Ryan\u2019s countless hours of debate prep have consisted not just of reading and studying, but also role-playing with mock debates.  Former Massachusetts Lt. Gov. Kerry Healey has been standing in as moderator Martha Raddatz. Ted Olson, the former solicitor general and renowned hard-charging litigator, has been playing the role of Biden. Ryan said Olson has \u201cimmersed himself into being Joe Biden.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve done lots of mock debates with Ted. He\u2019s come to Janesville (Wisconsin), we\u2019ve done debates there. We\u2019ve done debates in hotels around the country where I am at the time,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cWe sit around a table, we have a moderator, and he and I debate each other. He (Olson) knows my record, he\u2019s studied it, he\u2019s studied what we do in Congress, arguments that the president and vice president use to try to win their debates by default.\u201d A Republican source familiar with Ryan\u2019s prep tells CNN that while Olson has spent a lot of time going over lines and ideas with Ryan on the road, Ryan has also participated in half a dozen or more formal mock debates \u2013 keeping the events to the 90-minute time as if they were the real thing. Five things to watch for in vice presidential debate The source said that for a while Olson would \u201cbreak character\u201d and dissect an answer with Ryan, but as the debate has gotten closer Olson has stayed in character and continued to pound away at Ryan as if he were Biden. Tobin Ryan, who has been on the campaign trail a lot with his brother, has had a behind-the-scenes look at just how seriously the Ryan team has taken his debate prep. \u201cThey carve out 30 minutes here, 45 minutes there, if possible two hours here. And if anyone encroaches on that time, you hear from people that you can\u2019t do that. Paul\u2019s got to do his reading.\u201d As with most vice presidential running mates, Ryan was thrust into the spotlight and given a team of people to work with. Though many of Ryan\u2019s traveling campaign staff are those he has known for a long time and is comfortable with, he isn\u2019t used to having such a large team helping decide what he says. Tobin Ryan said there are times his brother pushes back and tells his staff he doesn\u2019t feel comfortable saying something a certain way. \u201cThere are times when he\u2019s finally like, \u2018I just don\u2019t speak that way,\u2019 \u201d Tobin Ryan said. Did Ryan call Palin for advice on \u2018Joe\u2019? The only other person to face Biden in a vice presidential debate is Sarah Palin. With all that meticulous debate prep, we asked if Ryan had called Palin for advice. King: VP debate no game changer but could shift momentum \u201cYou know, I haven\u2019t. I really don\u2019t know her. I only met her once and that was about two years ago,\u201d Ryan said. Palin famously asked Biden if she could call him Joe at the beginning of their debate. According to Palin aides at the time, she did that because she kept accidentally calling him \u201cO\u2019Biden\u201d during her debate prep. Ryan said he knows Biden pretty well because they served in Congress together for years, and he does call him Joe. \u201cI like Joe personally quite a bit, I just disagree with his policies,\u201d said Ryan, who also said he would only call Biden \u201cJoe\u201d if the vice president decides to be \u201ccasual.\u201d Biden to campaign in Ryan\u2019s backyard after debate Meticulous approach comes from teenage tragedy \u201cLife is short, you\u2019ve got to make the most of it. And so you attack it with all the enthusiasm that you can,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cThat\u2019s just kind of the way I approach life.\u201d Seizing the moment is a lesson teenage Ryan learned from tragedy: his father\u2019s untimely death at 55. Ryan talks often about being forced to grow up fast to help take care of his mother and ailing grandmother. But Ryan was also playing out the advice his father repeatedly impressed upon him. Tobin Ryan recalls their father, an accomplished attorney also named Paul, telling them to \u201cstretch your mind\u201d and saying \u201cyou need to absorb.\u201d \u201cPaul grew up in an environment where if you made a comment, you know, our dad would tell us further, \u2018What do you mean?\u2019 Why do you mean that? Are you thinking big enough?\u2019 So I have a feeling that Paul, in that sort of discourse, he\u2019s latched in to the whole debate process.\u201d In high school, after his father died, Ryan dived into his studies and extracurricular activities. He was in 10 clubs; he was class president; he was prom king. He was also voted \u201cbiggest brown-noser\u201d his senior year. The ambition that may have won him that moniker stayed with Ryan into his early adulthood. While living and working in Washington as a twenty-something, he sought out high-profile Republicans as bosses and mentors who were like-minded about supply-side economics and espousing what Ryan has called individualism over collectivism. Ryan became extremely close with former Housing Secretary Jack Kemp and former Education Secretary Bill Bennett when he wrote speeches and did research at their think tank, Empower America. When asked what made him think, in his twenties, that he was qualified to go back to Janesville and run for Congress, Ryan said Kemp and Bennett helped give him the confidence, after teaching him about the importance of what he calls the \u201cpower of ideas.\u201d \u201cWhat Jack, and Bill Bennett as well, taught me was that the power of ideas is great \u2013 that if you really believe in a cause you can make a difference in this country. I learned at a young age that if you apply yourself, you can actually make a difference.\u201d Ryan also cultivated important Republican players back home, like Steve King. King said he chose to back Ryan as the GOP candidate in the open congressional seat in 1998 over other more experienced candidates. \u201cOne or two were frankly not happy with me. And one was kind of a close personal friend,\u201d recalled King, who said his decision to back Ryan shattered that friendship. But King said he never regretted it, because from \u201cday one\u201d it was clear that Ryan was an \u201cold soul.\u201d \u201cHe gets it,\u201d King said. Ryan also had something others considering a run for Congress in the 1st District of Wisconsin didn\u2019t: the Ryan name. His large family has been in the area since the 19th century. His uncle founded Ryan Inc., a highly successful dirt-moving company. Until Ryan\u2019s father died, his name was on the law firm that towers over the center of town. Opinion: Why Ryan has edge in VP debate Luck of the Irish tie Mitt Romney noted to CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer that Ryan has never debated in the kind of forum he will be in against Biden, but Ryan has had election year debates as a candidate for Congress. We showed Ryan a photograph of one of his debates against his Democratic opponent during his first campaign,  against Democrat Lydia Spotswood. He noticed that he was wearing what he called his \u201clucky Irish tie,\u201d a green one that he wore on most of his election nights during his seven congressional campaigns. Will he wear it during his debate with Biden? \u201cI don\u2019t know. I have to see if I can dig it up,\u201d he said with a laugh How Biden is prepping for the debate \u2018I\u2019m not intimidated\u2019 In that first congressional campaign, Spotswood was 47 years old. She was quoted then as saying she was old enough to be Ryan\u2019s mother. Biden, 69, also is a generation older than Ryan, 42. Not to mention, as Ryan pointed out over and over, Biden has extensive experience debating on a national stage as a vice presidential candidate and presidential candidate during the 2008 Democratic primaries. Is Ryan intimidated? \u201cNo I\u2019m not intimidated,\u201d replied Ryan, \u201cI\u2019m actually excited about it. I came to Congress when I was 28 years old. I\u2019m used to debating people who are older,\u201d he said, though he also noted that one of the reasons his team chose Ted Olson to play the role of Biden in mock debates is because he is \u201cabout Joe\u2019s age.\u201d What questions would you ask the VP candidates?

            "article_content": "Did you miss the first presidential debate? You can watch the full event online on CNN.com. NEW: Ryan, Romney say debate offered voters a clear choice The Obama campaign says Mitt Romney was dishonest Republicans crow about the first debate; Democrats downplay it Analysts and a snap poll say Mitt Romney won the opening round A day after losing the first presidential debate, President Barack Obama and his campaign accused his Republican challenger Mitt Romney of being dishonest about tax policy and other issues. \u201cIf you want to be president, you owe the American people the truth,\u201d Obama said at a campaign rally Thursday in Denver. \u201cSo here\u2019s the truth: Governor Romney cannot pay for his $5 trillion tax plan without blowing up the deficit or sticking it to the middle class. That\u2019s the math.\u201d Romney\u2019s pledge: No tax cut for the rich The president\u2019s top aides were even more blunt. Analyst: Election now 'a horse race' Obama and Romney debate in Denver Best 'zingers' from debate night Rubio: Obama uncomfortable at debate \u201cRomney\u2019s performance was one that\u2019s probably unprecedented in its dishonesty,\u201d senior adviser David Plouffe told reporters. Still, senior campaign adviser David Axelrod acknowledged Obama will examine his debate strategy for the next two contests \u2013 on October 16 in New York and October 22 in Florida. The president opted against \u201cserial fact-checking with Governor Romney, which can be a never-ending, exhausting pursuit,\u201d Axelrod said. \u201cObviously, going forward, we\u2019re going to have to look at this, and we\u2019re going to have make some adjustments.\u201d What\u2019s next: Can Obama recover or will Romney run up the score? Meanwhile, Romney continued to push his debate theme that there\u2019s been much federal spending under Obama, complaining of \u201ctrickle-down government\u201d that has failed to solve the nation\u2019s economic woes. \u201cTrickle-down government that the president proposes is one where he will raise taxes on small business, which will kill jobs\u201d he said in an unannounced visit Thursday to a conservative conference in Colorado. \u201cI instead want to keep taxes down on small business so we can create jobs.\u201d He and his vice presidential running mate, Paul Ryan, then appeared together Thursday night in Fisherville, in western Virginia. Ryan touted the National Rifle Association\u2019s endorsement earlier in the day of the GOP ticket, adding that he\u2019s looking forward to when \u201cafter we elect Mitt Romney president, I can take my daughter deer hunting.\u201d Both the Wisconsin congressman and Romney, who followed him onstage, referenced the previous night\u2019s debate as demonstrating \u201ca clear choice\u201d for voters. \u201cLast night was an important night for the country, because people got the chance to cut through all the attacks and the counterattacks and all the theatrics associated with the campaign, and instead they were able to listen to substance,\u201d said the former Massachusetts governor. Analysis: Five reason the president fumbled the debate \u201cAs a result \u2026, the American people recognize that (Obama) and I stand for something very different,\u201d he said, before vowing, \u201cI am going to help the American people get good jobs and a bright future.\u201d His supporters crowed about his debate performance, saying it reshaped a race that Romney had appeared in danger of losing. Sen. Rob Portman of Ohio, who played the role of the president in debate rehearsals for Romney, said the GOP candidate had a \u201cterrific night\u201d in discussing Obama\u2019s record, talking about his own policies and setting \u201cthe record straight on \u2026 misleading ads.\u201d \u201cHe did exactly what he had to do for the undecided voter in Ohio or around the country,\u201d Portman said. To Ed Gillespie, a senor adviser to Romney, the GOP challenger brought focus to the sharp contrast between the candidates by showing voters that \u201cwe can\u2019t afford four more years like the last four years.\u201d While both sides were in full spin mode Thursday, it was widely felt that Romney won the debate itself. Analysis: Romney seizes the story Photos: The first presidential debate \u201cA week ago, people were saying this was over. We\u2019ve got a horse race,\u201d said CNN Senior Political Analyst David Gergen, who called the debate Romney\u2019s best so far after the 22 the former Massachusetts governor took part in during the GOP primary campaign. Alex Castellanos, a Republican strategist and CNN contributor, expressed surprise at Romney\u2019s strong performance, saying he \u201crose to the moment\u201d and seemed to benefit from the multiple primary debates. \u201cIt looked like Romney wanted to be there and President Obama didn\u2019t want to be there,\u201d noted Democratic strategist and CNN contributor James Carville. \u201cThe president didn\u2019t bring his \u2018A\u2019 game.\u201d The CNN/ORC International poll of 430 people who watched the debate showed 67% thought Romney won, compared with 25% for Obama. Obama joked Thursday that a different Romney appeared at the debate from the conservative candidate who won a grueling primary campaign to challenge him on November 6. \u201cWhen I got on to the stage I met this very spirited fellow who claimed to be Mitt Romney,\u201d Obama said told the crowd of more than 12,000 at a Denver park. \u201cBut it couldn\u2019t have been Mitt Romney because the real Mitt Romney has been running around the country for the last year promising $5 trillion in tax cuts that favor the wealthy. The fellow on stage last night said he didn\u2019t know anything about that.\u201d In Denver and later in Wisconsin, Obama also went after Romney\u2019s pledge during the debate to cut funding for public broadcasting, referring specifically to the popular Sesame Street character Big Bird. \u201cHe\u2019ll get rid of regulations on Wall Street, but he\u2019s going to crack down on Sesame Street,\u201d Obama joked about Romney\u2019s pledge to repeal the Dodd-Frank Act that reforms the financial sector. \u201cThank goodness somebody is finally getting tough on Big Bird,\u201d Obama added. \u201cIt\u2019s about time. We didn\u2019t know that Big Bird was driving the federal deficit.\u201d 5 things we learned from the presidential debate During Wednesday\u2019s 90-minute debate, neither presidential candidate scored dramatic blows that will make future highlight reels, and neither veered from campaign themes and policies to date. Moderator Jim Lehrer of PBS had trouble keeping the duo within time limits for responses, especially Obama, who ended up speaking four minutes longer than Romney. Romney criticized Obama\u2019s record and depicted the president\u2019s vision as one of big government, while the Democratic incumbent defended his achievements and challenged his rival\u2019s prescriptions as unworkable. But Romney came off as the more energized candidate overall by repeatedly attacking Obama on red-meat issues for Republicans such as health care reform and higher taxes, while the president began with lengthy explanations and only later focused more on what his opponent was saying. The former governor\u2019s strongest moments came in criticizing Obama\u2019s record, saying the nation\u2019s high unemployment and sluggish economic recovery showed the president\u2019s policies haven\u2019t worked. Complete coverage of CNN fact-checking the candidates \u201cThere\u2019s no question in my mind if the president is re-elected, you\u2019ll continue to see a middle-class squeeze,\u201d Romney said, adding that another term for Obama also will mean the 2010 Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare, \u201cwill be fully installed.\u201d At another point, he noted how $90 billion spent on programs and policies to develop alternative energy sources could have been devoted to hiring teachers or other needs that would bring down unemployment. Obama argued his policies were working to bring America back from the financial and economic crisis he inherited, and that Romney refused to divulge specifics about his proposed tax plans and replacements for the health care law and Wall Street reform that the Republican has pledged to repeal. At crossroads of economic crisis, debate disappoints In one of his strongest lines of the night, Obama said Romney lacked the important leadership quality of being able to say \u201cno\u201d when necessary. \u201cI\u2019ve got to tell you, Governor Romney, when it comes to his own party during the course of this campaign, has not displayed that willingness to say no to some of the more extreme parts of his party,\u201d Obama said in reference to his challenger\u2019s swing to the right during the primaries to appeal to the GOP\u2019s conservative base. Romney rejected Obama\u2019s characterization of his tax plan, insisting it won\u2019t add to the deficit, and criticized the president\u2019s call to allow tax rates on income over $250,000 for families and $200,000 for individuals to return to higher 1990s rates as a job-snuffing tax hike on small business. Romney repeatedly went after Obama on the health care reform bill, criticizing the president for focusing so strongly on a measure that passed with no Republican support instead of devoting more attention to creating jobs. \u201cI just don\u2019t know how the president could have come into office, facing 23 million people out of work, rising unemployment, an economic crisis at the \u2013 at the kitchen table, and spend his energy and passion for two years fighting for Obamacare instead of fighting for jobs for the American people,\u201d Romney said. \u201cThe right answer is not to have the federal government take over health care,\u201d Romney added, quickly noting his plan would include popular provisions of Obamacare such as allowing children up to age 26 stay on family plans and preventing insurers from denying coverage for pre-existing conditions. Read a transcript of the debate With polls narrowing less than five weeks before Election Day, Obama and Romney launched a new phase in a bitter race dominated so far by negative advertising as both camps try to frame the election to their advantage. Whether it matters is itself a topic of debate. According to an analysis by Gallup, televised debates have affected the outcome of only two elections in the past half century \u2013 Nixon-Kennedy in 1960 and Bush-Gore in 2000. 25 funniest tweets about the debate",

What questions went unanswered? Share your thoughts with CNN iReport On taxes, Obama said Romney\u2019s plan of tax cuts for the rich had failed before and would fail again now. Describing the Romney tax plan as a $5 trillion cut, Obama echoed a line from former President Bill Clinton by saying the math doesn\u2019t add up without increasing tax revenue, which Romney rejects \u201cI think math, common sense and our history shows us that\u2019s not a recipe for job growth,\u201d Obama said. Romney, however, said Obama still pushed the same policies as when he took office four years earlier, and those steps had failed to bring down high unemployment and get the economy surging again. He rejected Obama\u2019s characterization of his tax plan, saying it won\u2019t add to the deficit, and criticized the president\u2019s call for allowing tax rates on income over $250,000 for families and $200,000 for individuals to return to the higher rates of the 1990s. \u201cThe National Federation for Independent Businesses has said that will cost 700,000 jobs. I don\u2019t want to cost jobs,\u201d Romney said.

Debates by the numbers Both candidates had their wives in the audience at the University of Denver in Colorado for the debate taking place on the 20th wedding anniversary of the president and first lady Michelle Obama. Obama opened the debate by promising his wife they wouldn\u2019t be celebrating their anniversary next year in front of 40 million people, and Romney joked that Obama found the most romantic place possible for the anniversary. Analysts say Obama needed a presidential performance rather than fireworks or haymakers in order to maintain and build on a narrow edge in polls that indicate a very close election on November 6. Romney, who has been unable to catch the president in most of the polls to date, sought to generate enthusiasm for a change in the White House as the nation wrestles with seemingly chronic economic problems such as mounting federal deficits and debt. 5 things to watch in tonight\u2019s debate Lehrer, moderating his 12th presidential debate, planned to break up the debate into 15-minute segments focusing on different aspects of the economy and other domestic issues. However, the exchanges by the candidates scrambled the format, with the opening discussion on taxes lasting more than 20 minutes. Debate time: The candidates\u2019 version of the two-minute drill The two candidates shook hands and shared a laugh after being introduced by Lehrer as the audience applauded before being asked to remain silent for the remainder of the debate.  At one point, a loud bang off-stage seemed to surprise Romney in mid-sentence, and Obama looked behind him to try to see what happened. The other presidential debates will occur on October 16 in New York and October 22 in Florida. Vice President Joe Biden and Rep. Paul Ryan of Wisconsin, Romney\u2019s running mate, will debate on October 11 in Kentucky.

            "article_content": "A widening gap in battleground polls is a concern for Mitt Romney, GOP strategists say Republican nominee must work overtime to define himself to voters; steer clear of mistakes Strategists say it's critical for Romney to have a solid performance in next week's first debate Mitt Romney\u2019s gambit of running as the anti-Barack Obama could still work, Republican strategists say, if the presidential hopeful spends less time trying to define his opponent and more time spelling out how he would handle the job. \u201cIt would have to take a serious effort to define the race on (the Romney campaign\u2019s) terms,\u201d said one veteran Republican strategist familiar with the inner workings of the campaign. \u201cThey are going to have to run a more disciplined campaign. He needs to make the connection of what the state of the economy is and what his policies are.\u201d Romney has been trying to do just that with a new series of ads refocusing on an economic message that has been drowned out lately by attention to his controversial comments that nearly half of the nation is dependent on government and will vote for Obama no matter what. Opinion: Can Romney get back on track? In one positive 30-second spot, Romney speaks interview-style about a few of the proposals he claims will help bolster earnings for middle income Americans and ultimately create 12 million jobs before the end of a potential first term. \u201cMy plan is to help the middle class,\u201d Romney says in the ad. \u201cTrade has to work for America. That means crack down on cheaters like China. That means open up new markets.\u201d That\u2019s exactly the kind of messaging Romney needs to do more of, said GOP operatives who didn\u2019t want to be identified speaking about campaign strategy. \u201cHe needs to have a good week and run a good campaign,\u201d one Republican strategist said of the period leading up to the first debate on October 3 in Denver. \u201cGet his message out there and do it without making mistakes.\u201d But some GOP strategists are starting to worry that the odds aren\u2019t in Romney\u2019s favor with the debate on top of him, the election just over a month out, and the candidate running behind in battleground polls. \u201cThere are a couple of things going on,\u201d said a veteran Republican presidential campaign strategist, explaining the Romney campaign has struggled to define what he would do as president. \u201cThey put their emphasis on the negative side\u201d and are not well positioned to deal with a shifting electorate, noting that the economy is better and people are more hopeful, the strategist said. While overall unemployment stood at 8.1 percent in August, joblessness has fallen in key battleground states, which were some of the hardest hit during the recession. For instance, Ohio\u2019s unemployment rate is 7.2%, down from nearly 9 percent in August of last year. Moreover, nearly half of the 10 states with the highest foreclosure rates are battlegrounds, including Florida, Ohio, Michigan and Nevada. But the housing market is some of them is beginning to stabilize. Jobless claims fell to lowest level since July The Obama campaign outspent Romney in several battlegrounds in an effort to define the GOP nominee, former House Speaker and Republican presidential candidate Newt Gingrich said on CNN\u2019s \u201cThe Situation Room\u201d on Wednesday. And Romney\u2019s counterattacks haven\u2019t been effective. \u201cThe Romney campaign is yet to find a thematic way of explaining itself and laying out in a clear crisp way the difference between Romney and Obama,\u201d Gingrich said. \u201cAnd I think that frankly is a problem.\u201d The Romney campaign has used an \u201coverly methodical model where they go out and keep saying the same thing\u201d instead of using the successes of Republican governors in battleground states like Ohio and Florida as examples of how his similar policy proposals could work on a national scale, Gingrich added. Romney spent Wednesday in Ohio in an attempt to help turn things around. And he\u2019s campaigning on Thursday in Virginia, another key state where polls show he trails Obama. \u201cI know what it takes to get this economy going again. I care about the people of America,\u201d Romney said outside Columbus. \u201cAnd the difference between me and President Obama is I know what to do and I will do what it takes to get this economy going.\u201d Romney said his \u201cheart aches\u201d for families who are struggling. That may be what he feels, but folks in Ohio are having a hard time believing it, said William Angel, a political science professor Ohio State University. In a manufacturing state where union roots run deep, Romney\u2019s opposition to the auto bailout in 2009 rankles many while class differences could be an issue in southern Ohio where many people make their living as coal miners, Angel said. \u201cThat 47 percent comment hasn\u2019t helped him,\u201d Angel said of Romney\u2019s controversial fundraiser comments about Obama supporters. \u201cOhio is pretty working class. It really cut against a lot of folks.\u201d Sen. Rand Paul, a Tea Party favorite from neighboring Kentucky, joined Romney on the trail on Tuesday, taking his trademark populist message to the very groups the GOP nominee is counting on to help turn the tide of the election. But CNN contributor Alex Castellanos, a Republican consultant who worked on Romney\u2019s 2008 presidential campaign, says Romney rallies aren\u2019t effective because he\u2019s preaching to the base. \u201cFor months, I have publicly urged team Romney to go to Washington and campaign in the belly of the beast,\u201d Castellanos wrote in a column on Thursday. \u201cGo to the center of Barack Obama\u2019s government-centered society. Tear down the columns in government\u2019s temples.\u201d It will take more than winning over voters in Republican strongholds to give Romney the boost needed in the final leg of the campaign. \u201cOne of the things has been discussed some is that there was a strategic decision that simply being an alternative to Obama would suffice to get the 50 plus one,\u201d said another Republican strategist who has also worked closely with GOP presidential campaigns. \u201cHe\u2019s run as a biographical candidate. The problem when you run as a biographical candidate is the other side can poke holes.\u201d The Obama campaign spent the better part of this summer trying to define Romney by undercutting  his narrative. Romney was characterized as an aloof executive whose private equity business at Bain Capital in Boston profited on deals that threw people out of work or sent jobs overseas, a tactic which some polls suggest worked in key areas of the country. Out of context out of bounds? Not in 2012 \u201cWe saw Pennsylvania move during the early summer. It was associated with that first set of ads that Obama ran emphasizing Bain and outsourcing,\u201d said David Lowry, director of the Center for American Political Responsiveness at Pennsylvania State University. \u201cThose really resonated. It\u2019s a very blue collar-state.\u201d Some Republican strategists see the upcoming economic-themed debate as an opportunity for Romney to recover. \u201cThe Romney campaign tactically probably wanted to have a race that was perceived as closer going into those debates,\u201d said a GOP strategist. \u201cThe debates provide an opportunity. \u2026 They\u2019re not really equal until they stand next to each other in a debate.\u201d Others feel it\u2019s more important that Romney perform at least solidly in the debate but work harder on the campaign trail to gain momentum. \u201cThe most fundamental thing he needs to do is define the race,\u201d said another strategist. \u201cThey have to reestablish the messaging inside the campaign.\u201d However, political experts see Romney\u2019s debate performance as a pivotal moment. \u201cHe needs a game-changer in the first debate. He has one good shot to change things and that\u2019s the debate,\u201d said CNN senior political analyst David Gergen, who said Romney has to prevail with his deficit in polls growing. \u201cTo lose the debate at who is better at creating jobs and handling the economy is a serious indictment of his campaign. It\u2019s make or break time,\u201d Gergen said. CNN\u2019s Kevin Liptak contributed to this report",

            "article_content": "NEW:  Romney releases new campaign advertisement on the economy NEW: Obama and Romney challenge each other on China trade, key issue in Ohio Latest poll numbers show uphill battle in swing states for Romney Ohio has chosen the winning presidential candidate since 1964 President Barack Obama and Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney went head-to-head on China, taxes, and jobs on Wednesday as the two campaigned throughout Ohio. Both sought to illustrate what the next four years would be like under their leadership as new polls indicated Obama exceeding 50% support among  likely voters in Ohio, Florida and Pennsylvania. Those are all swing states that combined will account for nearly a quarter of the electoral votes needed to win the White House. Surveys suggest that Romney has lost his edge on the economy, the centerpiece of his campaign to highlight slow growth, trade tensions, and stubbornly high unemployment under Obama\u2019s leadership. The economy remains the top issue for Americans as well when it comes to their vote for president, but Romney says he\u2019s not worried about the new surveys. \u201cPolls go up and down, but frankly you\u2019re going to see the support that I need to become president on Election Day,\u201d Romney said in an interview with CNN National Political Correspondent Jim Acosta. His campaign pivoted back to the economy on Wednesday after two days of campaign themes centered around foreign policy with tensions over Libya, Iran and Syria dominating headlines as world leaders gathered at the United Nations. Romney slams Obama's welfare policy Obama to UN: No excuse for attacks Pres. Obama rep.: Red line for Iran Obama skips one-on-one meetings at UN Romney\u2019s campaign released a new ad saying Obama\u2019s policies aren\u2019t working for most Americans and told a crowd near Columbus that there is a right way and a wrong way toward economic progress. \u201cI know what it takes to get this economy going again. I care about the people of America,\u201d Romney said. \u201cAnd the difference between me and President Obama is I know what to do and I will do what it takes to get this economy going.\u201d At the American Spring Wire plant in Bedford Heights, Romney took a hard line against China over currency manipulation, saying it has pushed U.S. jobs overseas. He said, as president, he would adopt policies favorable to  manufacturing in response to lost employment. Manipulating currency can make doing business overseas cheaper. \u201cAnd that is why one thing I will do from day one is label China a currency manipulator. They must not steal jobs in an unfair way.\u201d The Obama administration alleges China has illegally subsidized automotive exports and undercut American suppliers. Ohio is a manufacturing center for auto parts. Industry research shows that 800,000 jobs in Ohio are tied to the auto industry, which also has railed against Chinese currency policies. Obama said his opponent\u2019s rhetoric on China was disingenuous. \u201cHe says he\u2019s gonna take the fight to them, he\u2019s going to go after these cheaters, and I\u2019ve got to admit, that message is better than what he has actually done about this thing,\u201d Obama said at Bowling Green State University. \u201cIt sounds better than talking about all the years he spent profiting from companies that sent our jobs to China. The candidates also diverged on tax policy and the deficit. Obama vs. Romney: How they\u2019d handle the $7 trillion fiscal cliff Obama said Romney\u2019s economic policies - trickle down economics - would not work. Instead, Obama said he wanted to grow the economy \u201cfrom the middle out,\u201d not the top down, to chip away at the budget deficit. \u201cI want to keep taxes low for middle class families and working class families, but if we want to close the deficit, we have to ask people like me to spend a little bit more,\u201d Obama said. Romney's wants conditions on foreign aid Romney mocks Obama's 'bumps in the road' Obama: We cannot ban blasphemy Obama warns Iran at UN Obama won Ohio by five points in 2008, but the GOP answered back big in the 2010 midterm elections and took back the governor\u2019s office and five House seats held by Democrats. Early voting in Ohio starts on October 2, a day before the first presidential debate in Denver. Why Romney is losing must-win Ohio As both Romney and Obama campaigned through Ohio, a Quinnipiac/CBS News/New York Times poll indicated the president leading Romney 53%-43% among likely voters in the state. Ohio, with 18 electoral votes, is crucial to winning the White House. In modern times, no Republican has won the presidency without carrying the state. It put George W. Bush over the top in his 2004 re-election and Obama won it four years ago by five points. The Quinnipiac University/CBS News/New York Times survey in Florida indicates the president at 53% and Romney at 44%. Florida is another state that Obama turned from red to blue four years ago. Some partisan polling indicates a closer contest. In Pennsylvania, the new Quinnipiac University/CBS News/New York Times survey puts the president at 54% and the former Massachusetts governor at 42%.

            "article_content": "Mitt Romney trails Barack Obama in most polls in key battleground of Ohio Almost two thirds of Ohioans polled support Obama's auto bailout, which Romney opposed Main criticism of GOP strategists and officeholders is that Romney is man without a message Several operatives blame Republican Gov. John Kasich for not doing enough for Romney Polls show Mitt Romney trailing President Barack Obama in just about every one of the swing states where the 2012 campaign is being waged. But Romney appears to be in deeper trouble in Ohio than elsewhere, an alarming development for Republicans who know that the candidate\u2019s White House chances begin and end with the kind of middle-class voters who reside in places such as Akron, Cincinnati and Zanesville. So why exactly is Romney trailing? Two surveys released in recent days, one from the Ohio Newspaper Association and another from The Washington Post, crystallized the challenge facing Romney as he embarks on his second straight day of campaigning in the Buckeye State. The topline numbers \u2013 Obama led by 5 points among likely voters in the Ohio poll, and a startling 8 points in the Post poll \u2013 only tell part of the story. Obama above 50% in some battleground polls Romney\u2019s favorable rating is underwater. Almost two-thirds of voters approve of Obama\u2019s decision to bail out the auto industry, a staple of Ohio\u2019s manufacturing economy. The president leads Romney by a wide margin on the question of who would do more to help the middle class. And when voters are asked which candidate would do a better job handling the economy, Obama has a sturdy lead, undercutting the thematic premise of Romney\u2019s candidacy. Romney aide: Obama \u2018spiking football\u2019 early in Ohio Interviews with some two dozen Republican strategists and elected officials across Ohio revealed an array of explanations \u2013 and no easy answers \u2013 for Romney\u2019s failure to catch on there. Some pointed to the Obama campaign\u2019s aggressive effort to hang Romney\u2019s opposition to the federal bailout of Chrysler and General Motors around his neck. Others said a hangover remains from the divisive 2011 battle over collective bargaining rights that hurt the GOP\u2019s standing with working class voters. Photos: From the campaign trail Romney: My ads have been 'spot-on' Who has the 2012 campaign momentum? King: A troubling trend for Mitt Romney A handful of GOP strategists blamed Romney\u2019s standing on campaign staffers who aren\u2019t Ohio natives. One longtime Republican strategist griped about the \u201carrogant top-down\u201d approach of the Romney team and said they have done a poor job listening to the advice of savvy Ohio strategists \u2013 a charge rebuffed by Romney aides who point out that field staffers from the Ohio offices of Sen. Rob Portman and House Speaker John Boehner have come on board. Still others cited Romney\u2019s lackluster political skills and said his stiff CEO demeanor as a turnoff for Ohioans, with one Republican officeholder saying that former Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour wasn\u2019t far off when he said recently that Romney is being caricatured as \u201ca plutocrat married to a known equestrian.\u201d A man without a message The main criticism that emerged, though, is that Romney is man without a message. \u201cWe are still at a point where I think it\u2019s still a winnable race for Romney,\u201d said Ohio Attorney General Mike DeWine. \u201cGenerally when you talk people, there is a feeling that Obama hasn\u2019t done that great a job. But Romney hasn\u2019t made the sale. He still can. But he hasn\u2019t made the sale yet.\u201d Another statewide Republican officeholder who \u2013 like others interviewed for this article \u2013 did not want to be identified criticizing the Republican ticket, offered a blunter assessment. Both Romney and Obama, this official argued, have provided nothing but \u201cnarrow arguments\u201d and \u201cfantasy land\u201d policy prescriptions for the country. Opinion: Can Romney get back on track? \u201cWhy is Mitt Romney running for president and what will his presidency be about?\u201d the official asked. \u201cI don\u2019t think most Republicans in Ohio can answer that question. He has not made a compelling case for his candidacy. Don\u2019t make your campaign about marginal tax rates. Make it about your children and your grandchildren and the future of this country.\u201d Romney is adjusting. The campaign, prevented from spending general election funds until after the Republican National Convention concluded in late August, launched its first statewide television buy of the campaign last week. The former Massachusetts governor has also intensified his rhetoric on trade, long a potent issue in Ohio, accusing the president of failing to stand up to China and costing Americans jobs. But Romney\u2019s argument du jour \u2013 he has spent a week attacking the president\u2019s handling of foreign policy and the recent turmoil in the Middle East \u2013 isn\u2019t likely to resonate in Ohio as much as a concise and aggressive jobs-themed message, Republicans said. Several Ohio GOP operatives even credited the Obama campaign for presenting a more consistent economic argument. Fallout over bailout Obama forces have persistently reminded voters about the auto bailout \u2013 on television and in small-scale earned media events around the state \u2013 and Republicans faulted Romney for failing to develop a succinct response to the criticism in a state where one out of every eight jobs is tied to the auto sector. Romney wrote a New York Times op-ed in 2008 titled \u201cLet Detroit Go Bankrupt\u201d and argued for a managed bankruptcy for the industry, without the use of government funds. In May, he took credit for proposing the bankruptcy idea. In August, he tapped a running mate, Wisconsin Rep. Paul Ryan, who voted in favor of bailout. Meanwhile, the Obama campaign has aired multiple TV ads on the issue and synced their pro-bailout message with down-ballot Democratic candidates such as Sen. Sherrod Brown. Poll: Brown ahead of GOP challenger in Ohio Senate race Labor organizations are leaving thousands of bailout-themed doorknob hangers and making phone calls to union members highlighting Obama\u2019s support for the auto industry. According to The Washington Post poll, 64% of Ohio registered voters view the federal loans to GM and Chrysler as \u201cmostly good\u201d for the state\u2019s economy. Only 29% said the bailout was \u201cmostly bad.\u201d Putting a finer point on the matter, one longtime Ohio GOP strategist called Obama\u2019s advantage on the auto bailout \u201ca kick in the balls\u201d for the Romney campaign. Ground operation a bright spot for Romney One aspect of the Romney operation that earned praise from Republicans is the campaign\u2019s ground game, which has made more than 3 million volunteer voter contacts so far this year and knocked on 28 times as many doors in Ohio as John McCain\u2019s campaign did in 2008. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the better operations in the country, as it always is,\u201d Romney\u2019s political director Rich Beeson told CNN. \u201cOhio has always led the way and it is again this cycle.\u201d The so-called \u201cvictory effort\u201d \u2013 a joint venture of the Romney campaign, Republican National Committee and Ohio Republican Party \u2013 has 40 offices statewide. The Obama operation, which has been deeply embedded in the state for four years, has more than twice that number. But the Romney campaign has managed to keep pace with the president\u2019s voter contact effort, data from to the Post poll revealed Tuesday. The humming ground effort, combined with Ohio\u2019s traditional GOP lean and what\u2019s expected to be a more animated conservative base than in 2008, has Republicans confident that the final margin on Election Day will be much closer than the 5, 6 or 7-point Obama lead seen in recent public polls. \u201cNobody will win Ohio by 5,\u201d said Mark Weaver, a Republican consultant with more than two decades of campaign experience in the state. \u201cAnybody who tells you that doesn\u2019t know Ohio. This state is too close. It\u2019s too divided. It will not be Obama by 5 or Romney by 5.\u201d Weaver complimented the Romney campaign effort and predicted a 2-point victory for Republicans in November but advised the GOP nominee to spend more time in the state and rely less on scripted remarks before large crowds. \u201cI think they need to get Romney here in Ohio more, and talking off the cuff more,\u201d he said. \u201cI think he is a sincere guy, and I think the more he talks off the cuff, the more people will like him.\u201d Another Ohio Republican strategist said Romney should begin dispatching his wife, Ann, to the suburbs of Cleveland and Columbus, where there is \u201croom for improvement\u201d \u2013 a nice way of saying that Obama has a double-digit lead among women voters in Ohio, according to the Post poll. A lingering complication for Romney\u2019s argument in Ohio is the improving state economy. Romney: My ads have been \u2018spot on\u2019 Mixed message from Kasich irks GOP Republican Gov. John Kasich\u2019s relentless boosterism for the uptick in Ohio job creation runs counter to the national Republican message that Obama\u2019s policies have kept the economy from bouncing back. The statewide unemployment rate has fallen to 7.2%, roughly a point below the national average. In bellwether central Ohio, home to the capital city of Columbus and its thriving suburbs, the jobless rate fell to 5.9% in August. Kasich is not shy about talking up Ohio\u2019s job growth, even if it muddles the Romney campaign\u2019s arguments about the state of the national economy. At a recent campaign event in conservative Owensville, a fiery Kasich boasted that \u201cOhio is rocking!\u201d \u2013 moments before turning the microphone over to Paul Ryan, who proceeded to issue dire warnings about Obama\u2019s economic policies. The mixed messaging has rankled Republicans in the Romney and Kasich camps. Both sides have done their best to keep the tensions under wraps, but they occasionally spill over into public view. Rex Elsass, Kasich\u2019s media consultant and a longtime adviser, told CNN that Romney is \u201crunning counter to the reality and the perception of people in Ohio.\u201d \u201cRomney would do better if he stood on John Kasich\u2019s shoulders and said, \u2018Here\u2019s an example of a state that\u2019s doing better with job creation, in spite of what the president is doing,\u2019 \u201d Elsass said. \u201cWhen you run advertising here that\u2019s running in the rest of the country, it\u2019s inconsistent with how people are feeling about Ohio, that things are getting better,\u201d he continued. \u201cIf you\u2019re just telling people things are getting worse and you throw in a graphic at the end of the ad that says \u2018Ohio,\u2019 that\u2019s not a state-specific message and it\u2019s not working here.\u201d Romney has, in fact, complimented Kasich\u2019s economic development efforts in a spate of local interviews and at campaign events \u2013 and there are no accounts of personal animosity between the two men. But Republicans close to the campaign have groused privately that Kasich is bringing little to the Romney effort beyond appearing at campaign events, while Boehner, Portman and a handful of other statewide officials have loaned manpower and money to the fight. Portman, for instance, has turned himself into one of Romney\u2019s most reliable allies on the campaign trail, hosting more than 20 fundraisers and raising more than $2 million for the campaign. Romney praises debate practice partner Portman One Washington-based GOP operative involved in the campaign and closely watching Ohio accused Kasich of not doing enough to help Romney win the state. \u201cNo single swing state Republican has been less willing to criticize President Obama at important junctures in this campaign than John Kasich,\u201d the Republican told CNN. \u201cAnyone who doesn\u2019t want an Obama second term should be furious at him.\u201d",

            "article_content": "NEW: \"He's sure as heck got to say sorry for ... attacks that are coming from his team,\" Romney says Obama questions Romney's role at Bain after stated 1999 departure Obama kicks off two days of campaigning in the battleground state of Virginia Polls show Obama with a slight lead over Romney in the state Mitt Romney described assertions  by President Barack Obama\u2019s campaign as \u201cdeceptive,\u201d demanding an apology and rejecting calls to release more than two years of tax returns. Obama, however, showed no sign of backing down in questioning whether the presumptive Republican presidential nominee continued playing a leading role at Bain Capital after taking a leave of absence from the private equity firm in February 1999. The issue has dominated the campaign debate in recent days, escalating the bitterness of the presidential race less than four months from the November vote. When Romney left Bain: The facts Romney defends Bain departure date Obama hints at defense budget cuts McDonnell: Obama won't win Virginia Romney conducted a series of previously unscheduled interviews on Friday afternoon to call on Obama to disavow tactics that Romney called below the standard for a presidential campaign. \u201cThere\u2019s no question but that his campaign is putting out information which is false and deceptive and dishonest, and they know it, and they ought to stop,\u201d Romney told CNN in one of the five interviews he did with television networks. In particular, Romney rejected the persistent contention by the Obama campaign in ads and statements that Romney misled either federal regulators or the American people in saying he stopped playing any management role at Bain Capital after leaving in 1999 to run the Salt Lake City Olympics. The attacks are \u201cbeneath the dignity of the president and his campaign,\u201d Romney told ABC News, adding they reflected \u201cChicago-style politics at its worst.\u201d Obama had promised a different approach when he ran last time, Romney said. The former Massachusetts governor said a report had revealed the Obama campaign had \u201ca strategy of trying to \u2018kill Romney,\u2019 and that\u2019s what they are trying to do. He\u2019s sure as heck got to say sorry for the kinds of attacks that are coming from his team. It\u2019s very disappointing on his part.\u201d The Boston Globe reported Thursday that documents filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission stated that Romney owned 100% of the company until as late as 2002. CNN confirmed that an SEC filing from 2001 also listed Romney as the \u201csole shareholder, sole director, chief executive officer and president of Bain Capital.\u201d In addition, CNN obtained from a Democratic official a Bain Capital filing with the Massachusetts Secretary of State\u2019s Office in 2001 that listed Romney as Bain president, as well as a director. Asked about the documents, Romney told CNN \u201cthere\u2019s a difference between being a shareholder, an owner if you will, and being a person who\u2019s running an entity.\u201d He denied playing any management role at Bain Capital after February 1999 and called the issue \u201can effort on the part of the president\u2019s campaign to divert attention from the fact the president has been a failure in reigniting the American economy.\u201d \u201cIs this the level that the Obama campaign is willing to stoop to?\u201d Romney asked. \u201cIs this up to the standards expected of the presidency of the United States? I don\u2019t think the American people think so. I don\u2019t think so.\u201d He went on to call the campaign tactics \u201cdisgusting\u201d and \u201cdemeaning,\u201d adding: \u201cIt\u2019s something which I think the president should take responsibility for and stop.\u201d In an interview Friday with CNN affiliate WJLA, Obama said the question needed to be addressed by Romney. \u201cAs president of the United States, it\u2019s pretty clear to me that I\u2019m responsible for folks who are working in the federal government and you know, Harry Truman said the buck stops with you,\u201d Obama said. \u201cNow, my understanding is that Mr. Romney attested to the SEC, multiple times, that he was the chairman, CEO and president of Bain Capital, and I think most Americans figure if you are the chairman, CEO and president of a company that you are responsible for what that company does.\u201d The timing of Romney\u2019s end date at the firm remains an important focal point in the presidential race, as Romney argues that he left the company before it was involved with the shuttering of certain businesses that led to job losses. The nonpartisan group FactCheck.org said it previously looked into the matter of when Romney left Bain Capital and concluded there was insufficient evidence to show that Romney was still managing the company, even part-time, during his time with the Olympics. In addition, Steve Pagliuca, a Bain managing partner, told CNN that Romney had \u201cabsolutely no involvement with the management or investment activities\u201d of the firm after his February 1999 exit, though he continued to be the sole stockholder. \u201cDue to the sudden nature of Mr. Romney\u2019s departure, he remained the sole stockholder for a time while formal ownership was being documented and transferred to the group of partners who took over management of the firm in 1999,\u201d said Pagliuca, a Democrat. \u201cAccordingly, Mr. Romney was reported in various capacities on SEC filings during this period.\u201d In addition, the Romney campaign cites multiple fact-checking reports that labeled as false or misleading the claims by the Obama campaign that Bain Capital invested in companies that outsourced jobs overseas during Romney\u2019s tenure. Obama mentioned the issue again Friday, saying at an event in Hampton, Virginia, that Romney\u2019s business record \u201cwas starting a company that\u2019s been investing in what were called pioneers of outsourcing.\u201d Asked about the heated accusations and counter-accusations between the campaigns, Romney said Friday that he and his team have no choice but to respond. New Obama ad features a crooning Romney \u201cWhat the president\u2019s campaign has done so far is run advertisement after advertisement, which are then shown by independent fact-checkers to be wrong, false, misleading, and yet they keep doing it,\u201d Romney said. \u201cAt some point you have to respond. You can\u2019 t just have the airwaves covered with these ads day in and day out without saying, \u2018Look, those are false.\u2019 \u201c Obama\u2019s campaign also has been calling on Romney to release more than the two years\u2019 worth of tax documents he has already made public, suggesting the candidate may be hiding important details about his finances. Some Republicans have joined Democrats in saying that a candidate\u2019s financial records are fair game in a presidential election campaign. Romney has released his 2010 tax records and an estimate for 2011. He said Friday he will release his final 2011 return when the accountants complete it, but nothing more, noting he already disclosed what was required. \u201cI know there will always be calls for more. People always want to get more,\u201d Romney said. \u201cWe\u2019re putting out what is required, plus more that\u2019s not required. Those are the two years people are going to have, and that\u2019s all that\u2019s necessary for people to understand something about my finances.\u201d So far, the Obama campaign has succeeded in making the issues of Romney\u2019s business background and personal wealth into campaign issues, while Romney has waged unending attacks on what he calls the president\u2019s failure to achieve more economic growth. Both campaigns came out with new attacks Friday that challenged the credibility of the opposing candidate. A new Romney ad used footage of Obama\u2019s 2008 Democratic National Convention speech to frame the president as hypocritical in his campaign tactics. Titled \u201cWhat happened?\u201d the 30-second spot faults Obama for making \u201cdishonest\u201d attacks in the 2012 presidential race, despite condemning such strategy in his speech four years ago. The clips of Obama\u2019s old speech in Denver, however, appeared to be presented out of context. The Obama campaign released a new online video called \u201cYour Turn\u201d that highlights what it called Romney\u2019s misrepresentation of his departure from Bain Capital. Obama launched a two-day campaign swing through Virginia on Friday, telling boisterous crowds that he kept his promise to bring change that helped middle-class families, and now it was time for them to work to re-elect him. \u201cBecause of the values we share, I believe in you.\u201d Obama told chanting, cheering supporters in a Virginia Beach school gymnasium. \u201cAnd I hope you believe in me, because I\u2019ve kept that promise, and I fought for you and I\u2019m going to keep on fighting for you as long as I have a chance to be your president.\u201d To rising applause, he continued: \u201cAnd if you\u2019re willing to stand up with me and knock on doors with me, and make phone calls and get out and organize, then we\u2019ll finish what we started in 2008.\u201d Obama carried Virginia four years ago, becoming the first Democrat to win the state since 1964, and polls show him with a slight lead over Romney at this point. He emphasized Friday that despite negative ads flooding the airwaves, it is the voters who hold the ultimate power on Election Day. Romney, Obama: Why they have trouble connecting \u201cWhen you decide change is going to happen, change happens,\u201d Obama said amid recurring chants of \u201cfour more years\u201d and \u201cU.S.A.\u201d \u201cWhen you decide we\u2019re going to move forward, we move forward.\u201d Delivering what is becoming his stump speech for the campaign, the president complained about the stalemate in Washington that he blamed on differing visions by each party. He framed the debate as a choice between moving forward with Democratic policies or going backward with Republican calls to return to what he called failed policies of the past. \u201cI don\u2019t want to go backwards. I want to go forward,\u201d Obama repeated several times in outlining the differences between what he proposes and what Romney backs. The Romney campaign reacted immediately, saying Obama policies that have failed to bring down high unemployment and promote growth are what should not be repeated. \u201cHe\u2019s right. Why would we try his failed policies again?\u201d said a statement from Romney spokeswoman Amanda Henneberg. In his most direct criticism of Republicans, Obama admonished the House GOP leadership for holding more than 30 votes on repealing or dismantling his signature health care reform law while refusing to join him in extending tax cuts on income of up to $250,000 for families and $200,000 for individuals. \u201cAll it would take is one vote to make sure that all of you don\u2019t see your taxes go up next year,\u201d Obama said. \u201cYou tell me what would be a better use of time.\u201d Obama\u2019s plan would mean higher taxes for 2% of the country who earn more than $250,000 a year, which he argued was necessary to help bring down budget deficits and would cause little discomfort to wealthy people \u201clike me.\u201d Republicans, however, reject any tax hikes in adhering to conservative principles of shrinking government to reduce deficits, as opposed to Obama\u2019s call for what he calls a balanced approach that would include further spending cuts and increased tax revenue. The president headed to Hampton and Roanoke for more speeches Friday, then will return to the White House for the night before two more Virginia events Saturday in Richmond and Chantilly. Earlier Friday, Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell told CNN that he believes support for Romney is growing in his state. \u201cAbout four months ago, Romney was down eight points,\u201d McDonnell said, adding that the more that people examine what he called \u201cthe failed leadership and impact of the regulatory policies in Virginia\u201d in comparison to Romney\u2019s ideas, \u201cI think it gets better for Romney.\u201d \u201cI won by 18 points after (Obama\u2019s 2008 victory in Virginia) and what I\u2019m hearing on the ground from business people and just the independent voter is this jobless record of 41 months over 8% and crushing national debt are the things that are driving people towards Mitt Romney,\u201d McDonnell said. What we learned from Mitt Romney In a sign that Republicans want to shift attention away from the Bain Capital issue, Romney\u2019s campaign teased supporters Thursday with news of an upcoming announcement on his choice for a vice presidential nominee. Later Thursday, the conservative Drudge Report posted a story, attributed to unnamed sources, saying that Romney had narrowed the field of prospective candidates to a handful, with former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice as \u201ca surprise name\u201d on the short list. Rice, who was the first African American woman to serve as secretary of state, has repeatedly denied any interest in running for vice president. In addition, Romney has previously declared his running mate will be someone who opposes abortion, while Rice told CBS in 2008 that she was \u201cmildly pro-choice.\u201d Erick Erickson, a CNN contributor and the editor of Red State, a popular conservative blog, tweeted that he had been assured by people in the Romney campaign that the choice would not be Rice. Romney refused to comment Friday on the vice presidential search. CNN\u2019s Kevin Bohn, Paul Steinhauser and Kevin Liptak contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Michigan autoworker credits Obama for his job at Chrysler plant Autoworker support is big advantage for Obama in state Romney hoped to put in play Local GOP chairwoman says Romney is the perfect candidate for the times She concedes, though, the president's favorable image is an obstacle for Romney Joe Cefali has to leave 10 minutes earlier for work in the morning because the traffic is getting worse. And get this: That makes him happy. \u201cYou feel the rejuvenation,\u201d the 19-year Chrysler worker says of the mood inside the Sterling Stamping plant and in the busy restaurants and other businesses near the Chrysler and GM factories. \u201cYes, we have a future.\u201d He wasn\u2019t so sure in 2009 when Chrysler was teetering on the verge of collapse and Cefali for the first time had to file for unemployment benefits. He told his wife to prepare to move and began searching for work in Texas or Tennessee. Then help came from Washington. Romney, Obama both seeking advantages as campaign rolls on \u201cDo you think you are working today because of President Obama?\u201d I asked Cefali on Wednesday at his local United Auto Workers hall across the street from the stamping plant. \u201cYes,\u201d he said without hesitation. \u201cIf he didn\u2019t come through and give that vote and say, \u2018Yes we have got to save Chrysler.  We have to save GM. We\u2019ve got to do this,\u2019  all this Sterling Heights would have been gone, would have been dead.\u201d Byers: Romney campaign in 'crisis mode' Support from union auto workers like Cefali is an advantage for the president in Michigan, a state Republican Mitt Romney had hoped to turn into a battleground. A new CNN/ORC International poll shows Obama leading by eight points, 52%-44%, among likely voters in Michigan. Romney and Obama split the suburban vote statewide and run even among independents. But the president leads by 11 points among women, by 54%-41% among Michigan voters from union households, and by 56%-43% in the critical Detroit suburbs of Macomb and Oakland counties. Both counties are dominated by the auto industry, and Romney went to high school in Oakland County. \u201cI don\u2019t think he is one of us\u2026 a Michigander,\u201d Cefali says of Romney. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t really relate to the working class.\u201d Barbara VanSyckel disagrees, yet she concedes that perception is widespread. New poll: Obama leads in Michigan \u201cHe is a self-made man,\u201d says VanSyckel, the chairwoman of the Macomb County Republican Party. \u201cI don\u2019t understand why people don\u2019t see that as much.\u201d Old Obama video featured in new GOP ad Byers: Romney campaign in 'crisis mode' VanSyckel says Romney\u2019s experience is perfect for the challenges of the moment, and she says her county\u2019s recent phone bank work and neighborhood canvassing gives her a measure of hope. \u201cI believe we still can win,\u201d VanSyckel said Wednesday. \u201cPeople are interested in what you can do about the economy here.\u201d Michigan is clearly in better shape, but hardly humming. Romney\u2019s remarks: Huge mistake or plain truth? The unemployment rate is 9% - above the national average. But it is down from the 11.3% it was when Obama took office. Michigan has added 57,500 manufacturing jobs during the Obama presidency \u2013 34,000 of those in the auto industry. While the numbers might suggest to some a potential Romney opening, the trend line is helping the incumbent. \u201cThe economy is on an upward slope even though the magnitude of the slope is very small,\u201d University of Michigan communications and political science professor Michael Traugott said. \u201cBarack Obama also has a reservoir of popular support or sentiment about him personally and views about how he cares for other Americans that he can take advantage of.\u201d VanSyckel said the president\u2019s image advantage is, in her view, the obstacle to Romney making Michigan more of a battleground. Poll shows voters\u2019 reaction to Romney tapes \u201cI think he is not making himself look as real as when I have gone to his rallies,\u201d she says. \u201cHe is pretty down to earth when you meet him. I don\u2019t think he comes across much that way when you see him on television. \u201cHe has been around it long enough. I think he needs to relax a little bit,\u201d VanSyckel said. \u201cRomney needs to differentiate himself. I think the philosophies are different enough.  But people also want to vote for someone they like, and for some reason they don\u2019t seem to connect with Romney the way they do with Obama.\u201d Romney\u2019s son Tagg will visit Macomb County next week, and VanSyckel says she was told both Romney and running mate Paul Ryan will return to the state. But there are no firm dates, and Republicans here are well aware the Romney campaign is not spending any money on television advertising. \u201cAre we getting brushed off?\u201d is how VanSyckel publicly phrased the question many Michigan Republicans are asking privately. Those party activists were upset when the John McCain camp pulled out four years ago. VanSyckel said Romney\u2019s local roots mean activists like her \u201care going to work harder for him\u201d and she hopes to get firmer commitments from the national campaign soon. \u201cDoable,\u201d she said of the prospects for a Romney comeback here. But she then added: \u201cWe\u2019re getting pretty tight on time. I look forward to hearing something soon.\u201d Opinion: Election winner faces a dangerous world",

Romney and running mate Rep. Paul Ryan also sought to reshape the campaign narrative less than seven weeks before the November vote by accusing Obama of favoring wealth redistribution \u2013 code for socialism among conservatives \u2013 based on a 1998 video of the president as a state Senate candidate in Illinois. America does not work by government making people dependent on government, Romney told a fundraising event in Atlanta, adding \u201cthat will kill the American entrepreneurship that\u2019s lifted our economy over the years.\u201d \u201cThe question of this campaign is not who cares about the poor and the middle class? I do. He does,\u201d the former Massachusetts governor said to rising cheers. \u201cThe question is who can help the poor and the middle class? I can! He can\u2019t!\u201d Obama responds to Romney's 47% comment Strickland on Romney leak: 'Deep chasm' Who are the 47%? Romney camp responds to fundraiser video Romney spoke as fellow Republicans appeared divided over his secretly recorded comments from a May 17 fundraiser that were made public this week. \u201cThere are 47% of the people who will vote for the president no matter what,\u201d Romney said in a clip from the event first posted online on Monday. \u201cThere are 47% who are with him, who are dependent on government, who believe that, that they are victims, who believe that government has the responsibility to care for them. Who believe that they are entitled to health care, to food, to housing.\u201d He also said he would \u201cnever convince\u201d the 47% of Americans who pay no federal income tax \u201cthat they should take personal responsibility and care for their lives.\u201d In response, three GOP Senate candidates in tough races this fall have distanced themselves from Romney\u2019s comments. Sen. Dean Heller, R-Nevada, told CNN on Wednesday that he had a \u201ca very different view of the world\u201d than what Romney expressed. \u201cAs a United States senator, I think I represent everybody, and I think every vote is important,\u201d Heller said, adding: \u201cI don\u2019t write off anybody.\u201d A day earlier, Republican Sen. Scott Brown of Massachusetts and GOP candidate Linda McMahon of Connecticut released campaign statements denouncing Romney\u2019s comments. Some conservative commentators also criticized Romney, questioning whether he understood the conservative principles he championed to win the Republican nomination. \u201cThese appear to be the words of somebody who doesn\u2019t understand American conservatism and its relationship to the American idea,\u201d wrote journalist John McCormack of the conservative Weekly Standard. \u201cConservatives don\u2019t believe in economic determinism. Conservatives know \u2013 and explain why \u2013 their economic policies will help the poor, as well as senior citizens, working families, and our troops who pay no income taxes.\u201d Others on the political right defended Romney\u2019s comments as an accurate assessment of growing societal dependence on government through entitlement and welfare programs that are major contributors to the mounting federal deficit and debt. \u201cI think the basic point is correct. It\u2019s what this election is about. Do we want a government-centered society?\u201d said GOP Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin. \u201cDo we want to continue to build government and grow our debt at an unsustainable level and bankrupt this nation? Or do we want to start working toward a path of opportunity, success - things that actually make this country great.\u201d \u2018Anatomy of a leak\u2019 of the Mitt Romney video A flurry of polls this week showed Romney unable to make up ground on Obama and slipping behind in some key battleground states, including Virginia. A new CNN/ORC International survey on Wednesday showed Obama also holding a 52%-44% lead in Romney\u2019s birth state of Michigan. Another new poll showed the secretly recorded  Romney comments had a moderately negative impact on registered voters so far. The Gallup survey taken Tuesday showed 36% of registered voters indicated they would be less likely to vote for Romney after the videotapes were released, while 20% said they were more likely to vote for Romney and 43% said the comments made no difference. Meanwhile, the Drudge Report on Tuesday posted a video clip of Obama reportedly recorded in 1998 at Loyola University in which he discussed ways to make government more effective. \u201cI think the trick is figuring out how do we structure government systems that pool resources and hence facilitate some redistribution - because I actually believe in some redistribution, at least at a certain level to make sure that everybody\u2019s got a shot,\u201d Obama says in the clip. Both Ryan and Romney made sure to mention the redistribution reference on the campaign trail on Wednesday. \u201cPresident Obama said that he believes in redistribution,\u201d Ryan told supporters in Danville, Virginia. \u201cMitt Romney and I are not running to redistribute the wealth. Mitt Romney and I are running to help Americans create wealth.\u201d At the White House, spokesman Jay Carney characterized the GOP attacks as an effort to divert attention from Romney\u2019s controversial remarks. Obama believed in 1998 and still believes that \u201cthere are steps we can take to promote opportunity and ensure that all Americans have a fair shot, if they work hard,\u201d Carney said. \u201cHe certainly doesn\u2019t believe \u2013 as some apparently do \u2013 that any student who looks for a government-backed loan is looking for a handout or that a senior citizen receiving Social Security is a freeloader or a combat veteran not paying taxes is a victim,\u201d Carney continued, adding: \u201cWhen a campaign is having a bad day or a bad week or some might say a bad month \u2026 you sometimes witness an effort that seems desperate to change the subject.\u201d Other Democrats were quick to pile on. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada said Romney\u2019s comments showed he only wants to be president of half the country. \u201cWe have a long line of people who are running from Romney as if the Olympics are still on,\u201d Reid quipped about GOP Senate candidates Heller, Brown and McMahon. Obama told the \u201cLate Show With David Letterman\u201d on Tuesday night that \u201cone of the things I learned as president is you represent the entire country. If you want to be president, you have to work for everyone.\u201d The Romney remarks, which sparked numerous fact checks, have gained more attention on Facebook than his speech at last month\u2019s Republican National Convention. Democrats pounce on Romney comments Priorities USA, a pro-Obama super PAC, is using the Romney clips in a new television ad to characterize Romney as out of touch with Americans\u2019 economic struggles. The group said Wednesday the commercial would air in Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Ohio, Virginia and Wisconsin, all battlegrounds that Obama won in 2008 and hopes to take again in November. On Tuesday, Ryan said at a campaign stop in North Carolina that Romney\u2019s comments were \u201cobviously inarticulate\u201d but made the correct point that people have become too dependent on government under Obama. Romney presented the same argument Wednesday in a USA Today op-ed. \u201cUnder President Obama, we have a stagnant economy that fosters government dependency. My policies will create a growing economy that fosters upward mobility,\u201d he wrote. \u201cGovernment has a role to play here. Right now, our nation\u2019s citizens do need help from government. But it is a very different kind of help than what President Obama wants to provide.\u201d How candidates are preparing for the debates CNN\u2019s Dana Bash, Ted Barrett, Deirdre Walsh, Kevin Liptak, Paul Steinhauser, Shawna Shepherd, Rachel Streitfeld and Eric Weisbrod contributed to this report.",

The first reference \u2013 47 percent \u2013 is the ballpark number smart pollsters in both parties consistently use to describe the president\u2019s most loyal base. The math behind that? Begin with the president\u2019s steady support among African-Americans, Latinos and other non-white voters. Then add in his backing among white, college-educated women. So when Romney told the fund-raiser crowd there are \u201c47 percent of the people who will vote for the president no matter what\u201d he was on solid ground and reflecting the consensus of his polling and political team. But how he got from that data point to describing Obama\u2019s coalition as \u201cvictims who believe the government has a responsibility to care for them\u201d is a mystery. Not to mention a sweeping insult to many working-class voters and other taxpayers who support the president. Romney\u2019s remarks huge mistake or plain truth? In the recording, obtained by the left-leaning Mother Jones, Governor Romney twice uses the \u201c47 percent\u201d figure pollsters, including his own, suggest is the president\u2019s base. Moments later he uses the numbers \u201c48, 49,\u201d presumably a reference to the nearly half of Americans who, in 2009, were not represented on a taxable return, according to data from the conservative Heritage Foundation. In any event, much of what he says in describing these voters is eye-popping. \u2018Anatomy of a leak\u2019 of the Mitt Romney video \u201cThere are 47 percent who are with him, who are dependent on government, who believe that they are the victims, who believe the government has a responsibility to care for them, who believe that they are entitled to health care, to food, to housing, you name it, that that\u2019s an entitlement and they will vote for this president no matter what.\u201d Many GOP strategists in Washington see this as another self-inflicted political wound, and the Obama campaign and its Democratic allies are gleeful for the opportunity to suggest it is proof that Romney is disdainful of working-class Americans and insensitive to those, who because of economic hardship or other reasons, need government help. Secretly taped comments put Romney back on defense Now, to be clear, some grassroots conservatives are not unhappy, and are hoping Romney defends his remarks and pushes a debate on government assistance and dependency. While a healthy debate about government programs and priorities is always useful, such sweeping generalizations as those used by Romney are often a path into political quicksand. In 2008, Obama won 95% of the African-American vote, two-thirds of Latinos, 64% of other minority voters, and 52% of white women who are college graduates. Take another look at those numbers. Now think all of those voters fit this?: \u201cThese are people who pay no income tax.\u201d Or this?: \u201cI\u2019ll never convince them they should take personal responsibility and care for their lives.\u201d It was recorded in May, but released seven weeks before Election Day, at a time when there is mounting evidence that the contest, while still highly competitive, is trending in the president\u2019s direction. They say timing is everything in politics. The timing for Romney here is horrible. He needs to be making his case about tomorrow\u2019s economy, not trying to explain away things he said months ago.

            "article_content": "GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney's verbal gaffes have once again stymied his campaign's ability to control the narrative Democrats were gleeful, while Republicans left scrambling after Romney's comments Less than two months before the election, Romney's challenge is to steer clear of speaking slip ups; hammer Obama on the economy In one ill-fated fundraiser, Mitt Romney managed to offend Palestinians, Latinos and some of the same people he\u2019s counting on for support if he wants to unseat President Barack Obama. It isn\u2019t the first time Romney\u2019s oratory fumbles have put his campaign on its heels, handed opponents material to push the stereotype of him as an out-of-touch businessman and provoked members of the party\u2019s conservative base to question his worthiness as their standard-bearer. \u201cEverybody has the same reaction: \u2018dumb, dumb, dumb,\u2019\u201d said Larry Sabato, director of the University of Virginia\u2019s Center for Politics, adding that Romney\u2019s gaffes reinforce a sitcom-like caricature of the candidate. Opinion: What\u2019s wrong with Romney After the tape, recorded during a May 17 private fundraiser at the home of Sun Capital executive Marc Leder, made the rounds on Monday, Romney convened a hastily scheduled news conference Monday night in which he said his comments were \u201coff the cuff\u201d and \u201cnot elegantly stated.\u201d However, he defended the main message of his remarks, saying he that while he could have made them \u201cmore clearly,\u201d he said he was trying to point out the differences between his and Obama\u2019s campaigns. Romney explains fundraiser video Strickland on Romney leak: 'Deep chasm' Romney camp.: Video a 'bump in the road' What did Romney mean by 'those people?' Democratic pundits gloated and were content to let Romney\u2019s words speak for themselves. \u201cI mean, I don\u2019t think Democrats had much to say at all. I mean, there wasn\u2019t much left to say,\u201d Democratic strategist Richard Socarides said on CNN\u2019s \u201cEarly Start.\u201d \u201cLook, I mean, I think that, you know, big picture, this is a \u2013 was a devastating moment for Governor Romney, potentially fatal, as people start to focus on this campaign.\u201d Narratives at work Another Democratic strategist said that Romney\u2019s comments played into the two narratives that they have pushed: \u201cFirst, that he doesn\u2019t care about the middle class. Well, thanks for the help, Mitt,\u201d Paul Begala, a CNN contributor and a senior adviser in the leading pro-Obama super PAC Priorities USA, said on CNN\u2019s \u201cAC360.\u201d \u201cOn the second front \u2026 in order to give big tax cuts for the rich, Mitt Romney is going to have to raise taxes on the middle class. Well, when you\u2019re claiming to wealthy people that 47 percent of Americans don\u2019t pay federal income tax, I think a lot of those people, retirees, working class folks are going to listen to that and think, \u2018Gee, I guess the Democrats are right. I guess he does want to raise the taxes on the middle class in order to help the rich.\u2019\u201d Republican strategist Margaret Hoover, who served in the Bush White House, said the comments would wound Romney but it wouldn\u2019t be a fatal one. Video threatens Romney campaign \u201cYou can understand while he tripped over his words, it probably wasn\u2019t characterized the best way. I think we can all agree with that,\u201d she said on \u201cEarly Start.\u201d \u201cYou can understand what he was trying to say. Do we have a systemic problem in this country when you have almost 50 percent of people not paying any federal income taxes? And he\u2019s running on a platform that would fundamentally change the tax code so that you lower the base, broaden the base and lower tax rates across the board.\u201d Reaction from other conservatives was mixed. While some some applauded Romney\u2019s comments, others saw them as reinforcing why they questioned his legitimacy. CNN contributor and conservative blogger Erick Erickson tweeted: \u201cDammit! I\u2019m just now seeing these Romney secret videos. We need that guy on the campaign trail!\u201d Others, such as New York Times columnist, David Brooks, wrote \u201cRomney\u2019s comment is a country-club fantasy. It\u2019s what self-satisfied millionaires say to each other. It reinforces every negative view people have about Romney.\u201d Will Romney's comments affect election? Fallout over new Romney video continues Romney defends hidden camera remarks Romney comments caught on tape And conservative commentator Bill Kristol, a frequent critic of Romney, called the remarks \u201cstupid and arrogant.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s worth recalling that a good chunk of the 47 percent who don\u2019t pay income taxes are Romney supporters \u2014 especially of course seniors (who might well \u201cbelieve they are entitled to heath care,\u201d a position Romney agrees with), as well as many lower-income Americans (including men and women serving in the military) who think conservative policies are better for the country even if they\u2019re not getting a tax cut under the Romney plan. So Romney seems to have contempt not just for the Democrats who oppose him, but for tens of millions who intend to vote for him,\u201d Kristol posted on The Weekly Standard on Tuesday. Romney campaign responds A Romney adviser tried to put the comments in context: \u201cWhat he\u2019s saying is there are people out there who don\u2019t pay taxes, unfortunately,\u201d Bay Buchanan, a senior adviser, said on CNN\u2019s \u201cStarting Point\u201d on Tuesday. \u201cThey\u2019re in a position where they\u2019re dependent on government, and those individuals are \u2013 those Americans are voting for Barack Obama. They\u2019re in his backyard. And so those are people that I\u2019m not going to be able to reach with my 20 percent tax cut or my cuts in spending because they would be concerned. It\u2019s not going to impact them getting a 20 percent tax cut. They don\u2019t pay taxes.\u201d Romney\u2019s comments were recorded by a hidden camera and posted Monday afternoon on the left-leaning news websites Mother Jones and The Huffington Post. Romney argued nearly half of Americans will vote for Obama because they rely on government support. Adding to his argument about entitlement, Romney said his \u201cjob is not to worry about those people.\u201d He also joked about wishing he had Latino heritage and talks about a Chinese factory his former firm purchased. A clip released Tuesday morning showed Romney questioning the prospect of ever reaching peace between Israelis and Palestinians, calling a path to a solution in the region \u201calmost unthinkable to accomplish.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m torn by two perspectives in this regard,\u201d Romney is shown saying in a clip that only shows only the candidate speaking and does not include any questions that may have prompted his remarks. \u201cOne is the one which I\u2019ve had for some time, which is that the Palestinians have no interest whatsoever in establishing peace, and that the pathway to peace is almost unthinkable to accomplish.\u201d Opinion: How Romney really feels about the GOP With two weeks until the first presidential debate and less than two months before the election, the timing couldn\u2019t be worse, political experts say. The Romney campaign had banked on its convention last month to make a favorable introduction of Romney to the electorate, a large part of it just beginning to pay attention to the election. But a CNN/ORC International poll conducted after the convention showed Romney gained only a 1% rise in the polls while Obama gained three to four times that much following the Democrats\u2019 convention. Romney\u2019s acceptance speech was largely overshadowed by a rambling, off-the-cuff monologue by actor Clint Eastwood, which preceded it. Last week, Romney was criticized by Democrats and Republicans alike for an aggressive and politically charged response to violent attacks on U.S. embassies in Egypt and Libya. After the attacks, Romney in a statement said, \u201cIt\u2019s disgraceful that the Obama administration\u2019s first response was not to condemn attacks on our diplomatic missions, but to sympathize with those who waged the attacks.\u201d Series of gaffes Over the weekend, Politico posted a story that detailed tensions within Romney\u2019s campaign and on Monday the campaign launched a new effort to inject energy and fresh policy details with a series of speeches and advertising. \u201cThere\u2019s been a bit of bad luck involved in some of it,\u201d said John Geer, chairman of Vanderbilt University\u2019s political science department. \u201cIt\u2019s not a surprise that these blunt remarks are going to be made in front of this type of audience. Here\u2019s a guy who\u2019s trying to work on his image about caring and this doesn\u2019t help him at all.\u201d Romney has been plagued by a series of gaffes during his presidential run. He joked with unemployed workers in Florida in June 2011 that he, too, was also unemployed. In January of this year, he told a crowd of supporters that he likes \u201cbeing able to fire people\u201d in a talk about insurance companies. He went on to say that if someone didn\u2019t provide adequate services, he liked to be able to find someone else who would. But critics took the first part of the quote used it to paint him as a venture capitalist focused only on a company\u2019s bottom line. Controversial video shows candid Romney In a February interview, Romney told CNN that he is \u201cnot concerned about the very poor,\u201d citing the safety net in place by the American government and said that his primary focus is the middle class. But it was the first part of the sentence that critics pounced on as evidence of Romney\u2019s elitism, while conservatives said the safety net he talked about only encouraged a welfare state. Later that month, at a campaign stop at the Daytona 500 NASCAR race, Romney told a reporter that while he might not follow the sport as closely as the most ardent fans, \u201cI have some great friends who are NASCAR team owners.\u201d And at an event in Detroit, he tried to prove he was behind the American automotive industry by saying that he drove a Ford Mustang and a Chevrolet pickup and that his wife, Ann, \u201cdrives a couple of Cadillacs.\u201d Defenders sought to defuse the controversy by pointing to Obama\u2019s comments during the 2008 Democratic primaries about \u201cbitter\u201d people who \u201ccling to guns or religion.\u201d But those comments came long before the general election and did little to harm him with voters. Romney\u2019s comments will serve as a distraction in coming days but there\u2019s still opportunities for him to get back on track with a weak economy and high jobless rate. \u201cHe\u2019s a tough campaigner Romney. \u2026 I don\u2019t think one should rule him out,\u201d Geer said. \u201cThe fundamentals are still a problem for Obama.\u201d iReport: Weigh in about Romney I\u2019m the 47% but - You\u2019re WRONG Mitt Romney! 4,000 millionaires in Romney\u2019s \u201947%\u2019 Jim Acosta, Peter Hamby,  Ashley Killough, Kevin Liptak, Jeanne Sahadi and Rachel Streitfeld contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "President Clinton will speak Wednesday during the Democratic National Convention Clinton recently has drifted off the Obama campaign's message The level of trust between them seemed unthinkable four years ago \"Nobody has a better grasp and understanding of the issues than this man,\" Obama says Another week, another convention plagued by weather woes. Another prime-time address by an iconic American figure who, hours before his speech, hadn\u2019t yet submitted a finished draft to organizers for suggestions and edits. Unlike Clint Eastwood, President Bill Clinton has had plenty of practice on this sort of stage. Tonight will be his seventh speech in as many conventions. Still, over the past few months, he\u2019s provided the Obama campaign with some accidental aggravations, displaying a unsettling tendency to drift off-message and derail narratives. He\u2019s used language that seemed to put some daylight between his and Obama\u2019s positions on tax cuts while the spotlight was on the president\u2019s policy, and he praised Mitt Romney\u2019s business record while it served as a central line of attack. Obama revealed: The man, the president Yet the day before the speech, an official for a campaign that hadn\u2019t laid eyes on a single word of it insisted they had no concerns. Will Clinton steal spotlight from Obama? Gibbs:Clinton 'fabulous' Obama spokesman Bill Clinton's long convention history \u201cWe\u2019ve been in close contact with him, and he is working on his remarks,\u201d said Jen Psaki, the Obama campaign\u2019s deputy communications director. \u201cAnd I\u2019m sure, when he\u2019s done, we\u2019ll see them. We have absolute confidence about what he\u2019s going to say.\u201d Photos: Best of the DNC It\u2019s a level of trust between the two men that would have been unthinkable four years ago, when Clinton\u2019s convention speech backing Obama came while primary season wounds were still raw. But over the past year, a new relationship has taken shape. A year ago, the Obama team approached some of Clinton\u2019s top advisers in an effort to bring the former president on board in earnest, according to New Yorker correspondent and CNN contributor Ryan Lizza. A rapprochement that Lizza says began in earnest with a late summer round of golf has evolved into a relationship few would have predicted in the wake of the bitter Democratic primary fight of 2008, when now Secretary of State Hillary Clinton challenged Obama for the party\u2019s nomination. President Clinton has weighed in on the race, offering the Obama team strategic advice. He\u2019s also appeared at fundraisers, an even more tangible brand of support. Obama has delivered fresh praise for Clinton\u2019s economic record, looking to ride a wave of mid-90s nostalgia. \u201cNobody has a better grasp and understanding of the issues than this man,\u201d Obama said at a June fundraiser. And as the driving force behind 1996\u2019s welfare reform law, Clinton has been in a prime position to rebut what the Romney campaign has called its most effective attack \u2013 the false claim that Obama has gutted the work requirement at the heart of the legislation. One of the Romney welfare spots aimed squarely at the middle class featured images of a smiling Clinton signing welfare reform into law, with the Republican nominee implicitly aligning himself with the 42nd president \u2013 positioning himself the true heir of the Clinton legacy. It\u2019s the special brand of affection engendered by any figure sporting a 66% approval rating in a CNN/ORC International poll earlier this summer \u2013 the highest of any living president That ad was countered a few days before the Republican National Convention by an Obama economic spot featuring a direct endorsement from Clinton. \u201cPresident Obama has a plan to rebuild America from the ground up, investing in innovation, education and job training,\u201d Clinton says in the ad. \u201cIt only works if there is a strong middle class. That\u2019s what happened when I was president. We need to keep going with his plan.\u201d What we learned from the DNC Some high-profile Democrats, including former Democratic National Committee Chairman Ed Rendell, have said the Romney welfare spots have been resonating, doing measurable damage to Obama\u2019s re-election effort. So Wednesday\u2019s speech isn\u2019t just some symbolic appearance. Nervous Democrats hope Clinton can stage a repeat of the magic he worked on the white, working-class voters who played a key part in his winning coalitions in two presidential elections. \u201cThere isn\u2019t anybody on the planet who has a greater perspective on not just the last four years, but the last two decades, than Bill Clinton,\u201d Obama campaign senior adviser David Axelrod told the New York Times this summer, when Clinton\u2019s speech was first announced. \u201cHe can really articulate the choice that is before people.\u201d Clinton\u2019s involvement hasn\u2019t just been for public display. Last year, the Obama campaign bounced between two separate and opposing anti-Romney narratives. One painted the former Massachusetts governor as a hypocritical flip-flopper, a political weakling without a core. The other tarred him as a right-wing ideologue, catering to the most conservative wing of his party. Contradictory messaging isn\u2019t necessarily a deal-breaker in politics, but each storyline undermined the other, with an extended period of indecision prolonging the damage. Then, as the New Hampshire primary neared, Clinton weighed in. During a visit by senior Obama advisers to Clinton\u2019s offices in New York, Lizza said, Clinton said the second argument would be their best bet \u2013 it would resonate with liberal donors and help keep swing voters from basing their vote on the wager a President Romney would return to the center. The role of strategic sage is one Clinton filled on his wife Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign last cycle. It\u2019s a role he might be able to reprise if she makes another run four years from now. But on Wednesday, he will make the case instead for the man who denied her the nomination. Obama praised, Romney pilloried at convention",

            "article_content": "Michelle Obama delivers personal touch at convention's first night Barack Obama watches speech at home with daughters The first lady has a high favorability rating in recent polls Mrs. Obama says president reads letters at night from struggling Americans As Michelle Obama took the stage at the Democratic National Convention on Tuesday night, she faced a similar task as Ann Romney of presenting her husband as a father and family man, above his public persona in the political spotlight. \u201cWhen people ask me whether being in the White House has changed my husband, I can honestly say that when it comes to his character, and his convictions, and his heart, Barack Obama is still the same man I fell in love with all those years ago,\u201d Mrs. Obama said. The first lady spoke on the convention\u2019s opening night, exactly one week after Ann Romney delivered what one CNN analyst called \u201cpolitical velvet,\u201d an address at the GOP convention in Tampa that took her sometimes robotic businessman husband, Mitt Romney, and turned him into a charismatic candidate who will be a champion of working-class Americans. Michelle Obama has an easier job ahead of her in convincing voters of the president\u2019s likability; his favorability in this area ranks far above that of his GOP opponent. But she still worked to counter a perception that Obama is a cool and sometimes distant president who has been slow to build relationships outside the White House. Photo: Obama watches first lady\u2019s speech on TV with daughters Candidates' wives: Appeal to women DNC CEO: We'll fill stadium in Charlotte Obama's coronation: The rerun Richardson: American people trust Obama She also weighed in on what drives Obama\u2019s decision-making process, noting letters that he reads at night with \u201cconcern in his eyes\u201d from struggling Americans. \u201cAs president, you can get all kinds of advice from all kinds of people. But at the end of the day, when it comes time to make that decision, as president, all you have to guide you are your values, and your vision, and the life experiences that make you who you are,\u201d she said. Both Obamas have talked openly about the importance of the family dinner and spending time with their two daughters, 11-year-old Sasha and 14-year-old Malia, outside of the demands of the White House. Campaign officials said Michelle Obama\u2019s focus would be to help augment the campaign\u2019s strategy to use the convention as a way to show \u201cwhat drives (the president) every day.\u201d Opinion: Michelle Obama has redefined black women A senior campaign official was more specific in the hours leading up to the speech. Describing the first lady as \u201cthe most popular political figure in America,\u201d the official said the aim was for her to highlight the president\u2019s personal experience and serve as a \u201ccharacter witness\u201d for her husband. She stuck to the planned themes. \u201cI have seen firsthand that being president doesn\u2019t change who you are \u2013 it reveals who you are,\u201d Mrs. Obama said. She further touched on her own story, growing up on the south side of Chicago, and shared stories about the values handed down by her parents. \u201cWe learned about gratitude and humility, that so many people had a hand in our success, from the teachers who inspired us to the janitors who kept our school clean, and we were taught to value everyone\u2019s contribution and treat everyone with respect,\u201d Mrs. Obama said. Michelle Obama convention speech dress dazzles, scores One thing Michelle Obama didn\u2019t do was go on the attack. \u201cThe first lady has not attacked political opponents in any way over the past four years,\u201d the official said while speaking to CNN reporters covering the convention in Charlotte, North Carolina. Lisa Burns, a professor of communications at Quinnipiac University with a focus on media and first ladies, said she\u2019s not surprised by the positive tone of the speech. \u201cWith the wives, they aren\u2019t there to provide the real red meat for the political junkies. There\u2019s enough of that from other speakers,\u201d Burns said. \u201cTheir job is to reach out to the undecided voters and people who are tuning into the campaign for the first time \u2013 so they want to keep it positive.\u201d Burns said it will take more than the first lady\u2019s speech to drum up the support necessary for her husband to win reelection. \u201cShe can definitely make a difference tonight, but ultimately when people go to the voting booths, they\u2019re not voting for the wife,\u201d Burns said. However, she faced a friendly audience on Tuesday. What we learned from Day One of the convention The first lady is known as a warm, open woman whose latest favorable numbers in a CNN/ORC International poll hit 65%. Obama campaign officials describe her as the \u201cmost popular political figure in America.\u201d Just four years ago, she was being portrayed as an Afro-sporting, machine gun-toting, Angela Davis figure fist-bumping her husband in a cartoon on the cover of the New Yorker. She\u2019s built her likeable reputation by tackling such issues as childhood obesity with her \u201cLet\u2019s Move!\u201d campaign, holding several high-profile events at the White House and appearing in public service announcements to encourage children and their parents to maintain an active lifestyle. She also started a vegetable garden on the grounds of the executive mansion. Even her eye for fashion has gained admiration. Mrs. Obama regularly opts to wear cardigans and skirts from such retail chains as J. Crew over high-end designers, putting her on similar shopping grounds as female middle-class voters. Lines from speeches that killed She wore a dress by New York designer Tracey Reese for her convention appearance. The women\u2019s vote is especially key in this election, as Democrats work to paint Romney and the Republican Party as out of touch with female voters. In a recent interview with Parade magazine, the first lady indicated she\u2019d like to add women\u2019s health issues to her list of causes if her husband is elected to a second term. Michelle Obama has stepped up in recent days to help fill the void left by her husband\u2019s busy campaign schedule, meeting with family members of the victims in the Sikh temple shooting in Wisconsin, stumping for her husband on the campaign trail and calling for volunteers to rally voters in battleground states. She continued that prominent surrogate role in a bid to set the tone for her husband\u2019s final push toward Election Day. The president watched his wife\u2019s speech from the White House with the couple\u2019s daughters who had their first day of school on Tuesday \u2013 a particularly significant day for eldest daughter Malia, who started high school.

A keynote speech on the Democratic Party\u2019s biggest stage. Is it 2004 again? San Antonio Mayor Julian Castro gave the most significant speech of his political career on Tuesday night when he became the first Latino to deliver the keynote address at the Democratic National Convention. \u201cMy grandmother didn\u2019t live to see us begin our lives in public service. But she probably would\u2019ve thought it extraordinary that just two generations after she arrived in San Antonio, one grandson would be the mayor and the other would be on his way \u2013 the good people of San Antonio willing \u2013 to the United States Congress,\u201d Castro said in his speech, referring to his twin brother, Joaquin. \u201cMy family\u2019s story isn\u2019t special. What\u2019s special is the America that makes our story possible. \u201cOurs is a nation like no other \u2013 a place where great journeys can be made in a single generation \u2026 no matter who you are or where you come from, the path is always forward.\u201d Julian Castro jabs Romney on health care Castro brothers on the 'American dream' Comparisons to the 2004 Barack Obama are inevitable. The then-Illinois state Sen. Obama gave the same address in Boston, launching him onto the fast track for the presidential nomination four years later. Castro, 37, shrugs off the similarities and talk that he could eventually become the first Hispanic president. DNC speech to focus on Mexican American family experience \u201cOh, I would be lying if I said that\u2019s not flattering. Of course it\u2019s flattering to anybody,\u201d he said last week from San Antonio. \u201cBut the biggest mistake I can make in this situation is to believe the press, to believe the hype.\u201d That humble response can be attributed to his modest upbringing. Castro\u2019s grandmother immigrated to Texas from Mexico as an orphan at the age of six. She taught herself to read and write in Spanish, eventually finding work in San Antonio as a maid and a cook. Castro\u2019s mother, Rosie Castro, learned a tough lesson at a young age while in school in San Antonio, where her teachers discouraged speaking Spanish. \u201cThey would charge us a quarter if you were caught speaking Spanish, and incidentally that\u2019s how much lunch cost,\u201d Rosie Castro said. \u201cWe were put down so often that the message was clear \u2013 Spanish was a bad language that shouldn\u2019t be spoken.\u201d As a result, Julian Castro and his brother, Joaquin, grew up in a home where Spanish was rarely spoken. Neither speaks the language fluently. \u201cI understand Spanish better than I speak it,\u201d Julian Castro admits. It was Rosie Castro who inspired Julian\u2019s political future. While in college she became president of the Young Democrats at Our Lady of the Lake University in San Antonio. Out of college, she joined the Chicano movement, working with the \u201cLa Raza Unida Party\u201d to fight for reforms beneficial to the Mexican-American community. In 1971, Rosie ran for San Antonio City Council and lost the race.  Along the way, though, she took her sons to various community and political events where they witnessed battles for voting rights and an end to discrimination on city services. \u201cI dragged them to every meeting, rally and voting booth,\u201d Rosie Castro said. \u201cThey helped me on different campaigns and handed out literature. I wanted them to realize it is your duty to be involved.\u201d Now, less than two weeks shy of his 38th birthday, Julian Castro, a graduate of Stanford University and Harvard\u2019s Law School, is the youngest mayor of a Top 50 American city. At age 26, he was the youngest councilman ever elected in San Antonio. Joaquin Castro, who introduced his twin Tuesday night, is a politician in his own right \u2013 currently running for the House of Representatives in a contest Democratic leaders expect him to win. \u201cSince they were young, I imagined they would do great things,\u201d Rosie Castro said of her sons. A source familiar with Julian Castro\u2019s speech set the bar high for the San Antonio mayor, saying it was akin to Obama\u2019s career-making 2004 address. Castro himself says he\u2019ll focus on his own story of achieving the American dream. Who is the next Obama? He drew a link for those working to write their own success story, addressing what he said in an interview was the \u201cclear choice that voters have in this election, and why the policies that President Obama has put forth make more sense to creating opportunity, bringing the middle class back, and assuring prosperity in the future.\u201d \u201cWe need to make a choice. It\u2019s a choice \u2026 between a country where the middle class pays more, so that millionaires can pay less \u2026 or a country where everybody pays their fair share. It\u2019s a choice between a nation that slashes funding for our schools and guts Pell grants \u2026 or a nation that invests more in education. It\u2019s a choice between a politician who rewards companies that ship American jobs overseas \u2026 or a leader who brings jobs back home,\u201d Castro said. \u201cThis is the choice before us. And to me, to my generation, and for all the generations that will come after us, our choice is clear. Our choice is a man who\u2019s always chosen us. A man who already is our president \u2013 Barack Obama.\u201d The choice of Castro for the convention\u2019s keynote address is strategic in an election where the Latino vote will be key. Obama handily won the demographic\u2019s vote in 2008 over Republican John McCain and it will be pivotal for him to do the same in November. The Romney campaign also knows the importance of Hispanic voters. Last week\u2019s GOP convention in Tampa had no shortage of prominent Latino speakers, including Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, a Cuban-American who was among those in consideration for Romney\u2019s vice presidential pick. Obama\u2019s advantage over Romney among the politically imperative demographic remains steady from previous months, with the president taking 61% to Romney\u2019s 29% of registered Latino voters\u2019 support in August, according to a Gallup survey. Romney\u2019s campaign has publicly identified a \u201cmagic number\u201d for the Latino vote if the former Massachusetts governor has a chance of winning the election: 38%. McCain garnered 31% of the Latino vote in 2008. But Latino interest in the 2012 election appears to be lagging. Compared with the 2008 election cycle, Hispanic interest levels in 2012 are 10 points behind where they were in the previous election, according to an NBC-Wall Street Journal-Telemundo poll conducted in July. Amid the lagging support, the White House announced in June a bold new policy that halts deportations of some young immigrants who came to America illegally as children. The policy is a \u201ctemporary\u201d measure that allows eligible immigrants to apply for work permits and deportation deferral for a two-year period. Castro acknowledges with a smile the strategy behind his prominent speaking role: \u201cObviously I\u2019m young and I\u2019m also Hispanic, two important groups in this election. And I\u2019m confident that I can do a good job in articulating why President Obama ought to be the candidate that Americans select for the next four years.\u201d Since being elected in 2009, Castro has built a reputation as \u201ca youthful and dynamic leader here in town,\u201d says Walter Wilson, assistant professor of political science at the University of Texas-San Antonio. \u201cIn a lot of ways, this speech is an initial test on the national stage,\u201d Wilson says, predicting that if Castro is successful at the convention, it gives the party a new confidence that he indeed is a rising Democratic star. \u201cIt\u2019s definitely a symbolically significant speech for the mayor. It sets the tone for where the Democratic Party thinks its future is headed,\u201d Wilson said. San Antonio Republicans are skeptical of Castro\u2019s broader appeal, with one San Antonio official calling him a \u201ctypical young, energetic liberal Democrat.\u201d He \u201cbelieves in big government, tax and spend, and those type of things,\u201d said Steve Heinrich, treasurer of the Republican Party of Bexar County. George Rodriguez, president of the Tea Party of San Antonio, echoed those comments. \u201cHe\u2019s a tax-and-spend liberal. He does not represent all Hispanics, we\u2019re not all the same,\u201d Rodriguez said. Before his speech, the young mayor Tuesday appeared to be more nervous about using a teleprompter for only the second time rather than for the high expectations surrounding his address. \u201cIn the end, the American dream is not a sprint, or even a marathon, but a relay,\u201d Castro said. \u201cOur families don\u2019t always cross the finish line in the span of one generation. But each generation passes on to the next the fruits of their labor. My grandmother never owned a house. She cleaned other people\u2019s houses so she could afford to rent her own. But she saw her daughter become the first in her family to graduate from college. And my mother fought hard for civil rights so that instead of a mop, I could hold this microphone.\u201d Democrats to highlight Obama\u2019s tough decisions Sarah Aarthun reported from Charlotte, Ed Lavandera from San Antonio and Mariano Castillo from Atlanta.

            "article_content": "Obama advisers won't answer yes or no on whether voters are better off than in 2008 Head of Democratic governors' group says voters aren't better off -- but that's not the question Republicans raised the question during their convention last week Obama is on a tour of college campuses ahead of his party convention this week Republicans raised the question in their convention of whether the country is better off than it was when President Barack Obama was elected, and it doesn\u2019t seem that Democrats have a convincing argument going into their convention this week. Both Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney and his running mate Paul Ryan had a variation on the theme in their acceptance speeches last week in Tampa, Florida. Romney: \u201cThis president cannot tell us that you\u2019re better off today than when he took office.\u201d Ryan: \u201cWithout a change in leadership, why would the next four years be any different from the last four years?\u201d One prominent Democrat said the answer to the question was \u201cno.\u201d \u201cBut that\u2019s not the question of this election,\u201d Maryland Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley said on CBS on Sunday. \u201cThe question, without a doubt, we are not as well off as we were before George Bush brought us the Bush job losses, the Bush recession, the Bush deficits, the series of desert wars \u2013 charged for the first time to credit cards, the national credit cards.\u201d Republicans pounced on O\u2019Malley\u2019s admission, with Ryan issuing a statement saying it was proof that Obama\u2019s policies aren\u2019t working. A tale of two conventions Gibbs: Heard old, tired ideas in Tampa Obama's coronation: The rerun Yellin and Balz on campaign 2012 Two of Obama\u2019s senior advisers wouldn\u2019t give a yes or no answer when asked on Sunday. While Obama senior campaign adviser David Axelrod told Fox News, \u201cWe\u2019re in a better position than we were four years ago,\u201d he didn\u2019t directly answer the question if voters thought they were better off. \u201cI think the average American recognizes that it took years to create the crisis that erupted in 2008 and peaked in January of 2009,\u201d Axelrod said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s going to take some time to work through it.\u201d White House senior adviser David Plouffe had a similar answer on ABC, saying, \u201cI think everyone understands we were this close to a Great Depression. Because of the leadership of this president, we staved that off. We\u2019re beginning to recover.\u201d Obama was riding toward the convention in Charlotte, North Carolina, on a speaking tour of Virginia, Iowa and Colorado college campuses hoping to energize young voters, a segment of the electorate critical to his hopes. Younger voters went overwhelmingly for Obama in 2008 and he still holds a lead in the age group in polls, but less decisively than four years ago. Even if they don\u2019t vote Romney, the Obama campaign\u2019s concern is that that segment and the others that helped elect him don\u2019t turn out at the rates they did four years ago. Senior campaign adviser Robert Gibbs told CNN\u2019s Candy Crowley on \u201cState of the Union\u201d that no one in Obama\u2019s campaign \u201cis sitting up here saying this is 2008.\u201d But Gibbs didn\u2019t think there was a case of buyer\u2019s remorse going into Election Day. \u201cI don\u2019t think that there is voter disappointment,\u201d Gibbs said. \u201cThe voters understand that we have been through a traumatic economic experience in the country, unlike anything that we have ever seen.\u201d And Gibbs said the GOP wasn\u2019t offering an alternative, only rehashed ideas. \u201cIn Tampa, we saw nothing but insults and old slogans and tired old ideas,\u201d Gibbs said. \u201cIn Charlotte, the president is going to focus on a plan to provide the middle class in this country necessary and needed security by investing in research and innovation.\u201d Obama\u2019s campaign has used that theme consistently since Republicans wrapped up their convention last week. The president told an audience in Iowa on Saturday that the GOP message was something that might as well have been viewed on a black and white television. \u201cIt was a rerun. We\u2019d seen it before,\u201d Obama said. Obama also challenged Romney over his qualifications to be the country\u2019s commander in chief, pointing out at that same rally in Iowa that Romney had failed to mention Afghanistan in his acceptance speech. \u201cGov. Romney had nothing to say about Afghanistan last week,\u201d Obama said at a campaign rally in Iowa on Saturday. \u201cDidn\u2019t mention it. Didn\u2019t offer a plan in terms of how he might end the war or, if he\u2019s not going to end it, he\u2019s got to let people know.\u201d Romney campaign senior adviser Eric Fehrnstrom said his candidate had addressed the war in an address to the American Legion the day before his acceptance speech. \u201cPresident Obama has allowed our leadership to diminish,\u201d Romney said in that speech. \u201cIn dealings with other nations, he has given trust where it is not earned, insult where it is not deserved, and apology where it is not due.\u201d The acceptance speech had a different purpose, Fehrnstrom said, to \u201cintroduce himself to millions of voters who were seeing him for the first time.\u201d \u201cWe thought that speech was a home run,\u201d he added.",

Read about Obama\u2019s Reddit AMA chat here Below are the questions and answers as they appeared on Reddit. \u2014\u2014\u2013 Q: gobearss How do you balance family life and hobbies with, well, being the POTUS? A: PresidentObama It\u2019s hard - truthfully the main thing other than work is just making sure that I\u2019m spending enough time with michelle and the girls. The big advantage I have is that I live above the store - so I have no commute! So we make sure that when I\u2019m in DC I never miss dinner with them at 6:30 pm - even if I have to go back down to the Oval for work later in the evening. I do work out every morning as well, and try to get a basketball or golf game in on the weekends just to get out of the bubble. Speaking of balance, though, I need to get going so I\u2019m back in DC in time for dinner. But I want to thank everybody at reddit for participating - this is an example of how technology and the internet can empower the sorts of conversations that strengthen our democracy over the long run. AND REMEMBER TO VOTE IN NOVEMBER - if you need to know how to register, go to Gottaregister.com. By the way, if you want to know what I think about this whole reddit experience - NOT BAD! \u2014\u2014 Q: hmlee I am recent law school graduate. Despite graduating from a top school, I find myself unemployed with a large student loan debt burden. While I\u2019m sure my immediate prospects will improve in time, it\u2019s difficult to be optimistic about the future knowing that my ability to live a productive life \u2013 to have a fulfilling career, to buy a house, to someday raise a family \u2013 is hampered by my debt and the bleak economic outlook for young people. I know that I\u2019m not alone in feeling this way. Many of us are demoralized. Your 2008 campaign was successful in large part due to the efforts of younger demographics. We worked for you, we campaigned for you, and we turned out in record numbers to vote for you. What can I say to encourage those in similar situations as I am to show up again in November? What hope can you offer us for your second term? A: PresidentObama I understand how tough it is out there for recent grads. You\u2019re right - your long term prospects are great, but that doesn\u2019t help in the short term. Obviously some of the steps we have taken already help young people at the start of their careers. Because of the health care bill, you can stay on your parent\u2019s plan until you\u2019re twenty six. Because of our student loan bill, we are lowering the debt burdens that young people have to carry. But the key for your future, and all our futures, is an economy that is growing and creating solid middle class jobs - and that\u2019s why the choice in this election is so important. The other party has two ideas for growth - more taxs cuts for the wealthy (paid for by raising tax burdens on the middle class and gutting investments like education) and getting rid of regulations we\u2019ve put in place to control the excesses on wall street and help consumers. These ideas have been tried, they didnt work, and will make the economy worse. I want to keep promoting advanced manufacturing that will bring jobs back to America, promote all-American energy sources (including wind and solar), keep investing in education and make college more affordable, rebuild our infrastructure, invest in science, and reduce our deficit in a balanced way with prudent spending cuts and higher taxes on folks making more than $250,000/year. I don\u2019t promise that this will solve all our immediate economic challenges, but my plans will lay the foundation for long term growth for your generation, and for generations to follow. So don\u2019t be discouraged - we didn\u2019t get into this fix overnight, and we won\u2019t get out overnight, but we are making progress and with your help will make more. \u2014\u2014\u2013 Q: silent1mezzo What\u2019s the recipe for the White House\u2019s beer? A: PresidentObama It will be out soon! I can tell from first hand experience, it is tasty. \u2014\u2014\u2013 Q: suzmerk What are you going to do to end the corrupting influence of money in politics during your second term? A: PresidentObama Money has always been a factor in politics, but we are seeing something new in the no-holds barred flow of seven and eight figure checks, most undisclosed, into super-PACs; they fundamentally threaten to overwhelm the political process over the long run and drown out the voices of ordinary citizens. We need to start with passing the Disclose Act that is already written and been sponsored in Congress - to at least force disclosure of who is giving to who. We should also pass legislation prohibiting the bundling of campaign contributions from lobbyists. Over the longer term, I think we need to seriously consider mobilizing a constitutional amendment process to overturn Citizens United (assuming the Supreme Court doesn\u2019t revisit it). Even if the amendment process falls short, it can shine a spotlight of the super-PAC phenomenon and help apply pressure for change. \u2014\u2013 Q: FifthSurprise What was the most difficult decision that you had to make during this term? A: PresidentObama The decision to surge our forces in afghanistan. Any time you send our brave men and women into battle, you know that not everyone will come home safely, and that necessarily weighs heavily on you. The decision did help us blunt the taliban\u2019s momentum, and is allowing us to transition to afghan lead - so we will have recovered that surge at the end of this month, and will end the war at the end of 2014. But knowing of the heroes that have fallen is something you never forget. \u2014\u2013 Q: daveforamerica What is the first thing you\u2019ll do on November 7th, win or lose? A: PresidentObama Win or lose, I\u2019ll be thanking everybody who is working so hard - especially all the volunteers in field offices all across the country, and the amazing young people in our campaign offices. \u2014\u2014- Q: PartyInYourMouth How are you going help small businesses in 2013 and 2014? and what if any bills are you going to implement for small businesses, in 2013, and 2014? A: PresidentObama We\u2019ve really focused on this since I came into office - 18 tax cuts for small business, easier funding from the SBA. Going forward, I want to keep taxes low for the 98 percent of small businesses that have $250,000 or less in income, make it easier for small business to access financing, and expand their opportunities to export. And we will be implementing the Jobs Act bill that I signed that will make it easier for startups to access crowd-funding and reduce their tax burden at the start-up stage. \u2014\u2014\u2013 Q: SharkGirl We know how Republicans feel about protecting Internet Freedom. Is Internet Freedom an issue you\u2019d push to add to the Democratic Party\u2019s 2012 platform? A: PresidentObama Internet freedom is something I know you all care passionately about; I do too. We will fight hard to make sure that the internet remains the open forum for everybody - from those who are expressing an idea to those to want to start a business. And although there will be occasional disagreements on the details of various legislative proposals, I won\u2019t stray from that principle - and it will be reflected in the platform. \u2014\u2014- Q: ormirian Are you considering increasing funds to the space program? A: PresidentObama Making sure we stay at the forefront of space exploration is a big priority for my administration. The passing of Neil Armstrong this week is a reminder of the inspiration and wonder that our space program has provided in the past; the curiosity probe on mars is a reminder of what remains to be discovered. The key is to make sure that we invest in cutting edge research that can take us to the next level - so even as we continue work with the international space station, we are focused on a potential mission to a asteroid as a prelude to a manned Mars flight.",

Paul Ryan of Wisconsin as his running mate for the White House \u2013 a bold and risky move that energized both conservatives and their opponents. Ryan is a rising Republican star and the party\u2019s leader on fiscal and budget issues. He said he is overwhelmed by the reaction to the announcement that he is Romney\u2019s running mate. \u201cI was amazed at the energy, the crowd, people who just want to see us take the country in a different direction,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cIt\u2019s very exciting. We\u2019re going to win this campaign. We\u2019ve got the wind behind us. I\u2019m really excited about this race.\u201d How Romney campaign kept Ryan tap under wraps Ryan is the architect of a Republican spending plan that would overhaul many entitlement programs, making him a favorite of conservatives, whose support for Romney, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, has been shaky. \u201cYou saw the response of our crowds, very excited to meet Paul Ryan to get to know him,\u201d Romney said. \u201cA lot of them know him pretty well by virtue of things he\u2019s been fighting for, but it just means one more person to drive a very strong message.\u201d But the Romney camp was also quick to put some distance between Ryan\u2019s initial budget blueprint and his own. \u201cGov. Romney applauds Paul Ryan for going in the right direction with his budget,\u201d the campaign said, \u201cand as president he will be putting together his own plan for cutting the deficit and putting the budget on a path to balance.\u201d Romney: It's Ryan for my VP Romney introduces Paul Ryan as VP choice Wait -- who's running for what again? Paul Ryan: I'm a policy person Romney campaign: Ryan is V.P. choice Rep. Paul Ryan up close His running mate choice draws some clear lines with Romney\u2019s Democratic opponents over the size of the cuts in Ryan\u2019s plan and his prior votes on taxes, which they say favor the wealthiest Americans \u2013 a point of contention in an election in which both sides consider themselves champions of the middle class. \u201cCongressman Paul Ryan is an outstanding choice as our country\u2019s next vice president, and today\u2019s announcement demonstrates Governor Romney\u2019s commitment to returning fiscal sanity back to Washington, DC.,\u201d said former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum, who mounted the strongest conservative challenge to Romney\u2019s campaign in the Republican primaries. \u201cI have long supported Paul Ryan\u2019s fiscal and entitlement reforms to return our country back on a path of fiscal health.\u201d Ryan, 42, is considered a policy wonk and conservative Catholic likely to energize the GOP base and sharpen the campaign\u2019s focus on government spending and the economy. That could boost Romney\u2019s appeal among middle-of-the-road Catholic voters in battleground states such as Ohio and Pennsylvania, though Ryan offers little in the way of foreign policy experience. The House Budget Committee chairman was chosen ahead of Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, former Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty and Sen. Rob Portman of Ohio. A campaign aide told CNN that Romney decided on Ryan on August 1. GOP sources said Friday that the latter three had all been told that they wouldn\u2019t be getting the nod. Meanwhile, Vice President Joe Biden contacted Ryan, welcoming him to the race, saying that he \u201clooked forward to engaging him on the clear choice voters face this November.\u201d And Democrats were quick to make Ryan\u2019s fiscal policies a target. Analysis: A bold but risky choice for running mate \u201cCongressman Paul Ryan and Mitt Romney are a match made in millionaires\u2019 heaven, but they\u2019ll be a nightmare for seniors who\u2019ve earned their Medicare benefits,\u201d said New York Rep. Steve Israel, chairman of Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, \u201cFor the last 18 months, we\u2019ve said Republicans will have to defend the indefensible \u2013 their vote to end Medicare. Now with Congressman Ryan on the ticket, House Republicans face the one thing they hoped to avoid \u2013 a national debate on their budget that puts millionaires first and Medicare and the middle class last.\u201d The announcement comes at the end of a week in which Democrats continued relentless attacks on Romney over his refusal to reveal more of his tax records and which saw three polls in 24 hours showing Obama with a growing lead over his Republican challenger. A CNN/ORC International poll released Thursday showed a big jump in those who had an unfavorable opinion of the GOP candidate. While some analysts saw Romney\u2019s choice as risky, others thought Romney had to go big. \u201cWith Mitt Romney losing ground to President Obama in the polls, I don\u2019t see the selection of Paul Ryan as \u2018risky,\u2019 I see the choice as bold and necessary,\u201d Republican consultant Ford O\u2019Connell told CNN. Timeline: Paul Ryan through the years CNN senior political analyst David Gergen says the Ryan pick is \u201can opportunity for the Romney campaign to go on the offense.\u201d Ryan, appearing with Romney in Norfolk, Virginia, at the beginning of a four-day, four-state bus tour moved quickly to position himself and Romney as champions of voters dissatisfied with the economy and to draw his own contrasts with President Barack Obama. \u201cWe won\u2019t duck the tough issues, we will lead!\u201d Ryan told a cheering crowd on the battleship USS Wisconsin. \u201cWe won\u2019t blame others, we will take responsibility. We won\u2019t replace our founding principles, we will reapply them.\u201d \u201cI hear some people say that this is just \u2018the new normal.\u2019 Higher unemployment, declining incomes and crushing debt is not a new normal. It\u2019s the result of misguided policies. And next January, our economy will begin a comeback with the Romney plan for a stronger middle class that will lead to more jobs and more take-home pay for working Americans.\u201d Romney called Ryan \u201ca faithful Catholic\u201d who \u201cbelieves in the worth and dignity of every human life.\u201d He lauded the fifth-generation Wisconsin native serving his seventh term in Congress as \u201can intellectual leader of the Republican Party\u201d and a person who will help lead the country \u201cto widespread and shared prosperity.\u201d Romney introduced his running mate saying that his \u201cintegrity is unquestioned and his word is good.\u201d Paul Ryan, top GOP voice on fiscal matters But Romney, 65, initially flubbed his big line, announcing, \u201cJoin me in welcoming the next president of the United States, Paul Ryan!\u201d He recovered moments later when Ryan took the stage, saying, \u201cEvery now and then, I\u2019m known to make a mistake. I did not make a mistake with this guy, but I can tell you this: He\u2019s going to be the next vice president of the United States.\u201d At a later stop in Manassas, Virginia, Ryan picked up again on the economy. To choruses of \u201cno\u201d from the crowd, Ryan asked, \u201cDo you think the economy is heading in the right direction? Do you think we\u2019re getting our debt and deficit under control? Do you think the country is on the right track?\u201d \u201cDo you know why? he asked. \u201cBecause President Obama is our president and he has put all of his policies in place and they\u2019re just not working.\u201d Romney then took the microphone, touting energy independence, improved worker skills and enhanced trade opportunities. First, he drew cheers for his choice of Ryan. \u201cIf you said one word about Paul Ryan it would probably be leader,\u201d Romney said. \u201cThis is a man who learned leadership young because leadership is a function of character and courage.\u201d Accolades on the veep choice poured in from Republicans. In a statement, Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell called Ryan, the House budget chairman, \u201ca confirmation that Gov. Romney is serious about strengthening America\u2019s economic future, tackling the deficits and debt that have skyrocketed under President Obama, and returning to a path to solvency and security.\u201d Pawlenty, in New Hampshire, called Ryan \u201ca respected leader and a bold thinker regarding the changes needed to restore America.\u201d But the Obama campaign reacted to the announcement making familiar charges against the architect of GOP budget plans and tried to tie him to the incumbent\u2019s predecessor, which is consistently blamed for the country\u2019s economic doldrums. \u201cIn naming Congressman Paul Ryan, Mitt Romney has chosen a leader of the House Republicans who shares his commitment to the flawed theory that new budget-busting tax cuts for the wealthy, while placing greater burdens on the middle class and seniors, will somehow deliver a stronger economy,\u201d it said in a statement. \u201cThe architect of the radical Republican House budget, Ryan, like Romney, proposed an additional $250,000 tax cut for millionaires, and deep cuts in education from Head Start to college aid. His plan also would end Medicare as we know it by turning it into a voucher system, shifting thousands of dollars in health care costs to seniors. As a member of Congress, Ryan rubber-stamped the reckless Bush economic policies that exploded our deficit and crashed our economy. Now the Romney-Ryan ticket would take us back by repeating the same, catastrophic mistakes.\u201d Democratic attacks on Ryan focus on changes to Medicare and Medicaid The bus tour will take Romney through major media markets in four battleground states \u2013 Virginia, North Carolina, Florida and Ohio. Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell, once a potential running mate, introduced Romney. House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, a Richmond native, joined Romney at stops in the commonwealth on Saturday. Prior to Saturday\u2019s announcement, many Republicans who spoke to CNN \u2013 all of them granted anonymity to speak freely without angering Romney officials in Boston \u2013 wondered why Romney would announce the pick on a weekend when millions of potential voters are likely to be distracted by the Olympics, PGA golf, late-season baseball and the box office release of the latest Bourne thriller.

            "article_content": "President Obama and Mitt Romney give differing spin on the July jobs report The economy added 163,000 jobs last month, but unemployment rose slightly Romney says an allegation that he didn't pay taxes some years is not true Obama and his campaign note that job growth continues, but more is needed A glass half-full or emptying fast? Depends on who you listened to Friday as President Barack Obama and certain Republican nominee Mitt Romney described the July jobs report at competing public appearances. July jobs report: Hiring picks up, unemployment rises Flanked by what he called middle-class Americans at the White House, Obama said the July figures showed 29 straight months of job growth, including 1.1 million new jobs this year, following the recession that was in place when he took office in January 2009. \u201cWe haven\u2019t had to come back from an economic crisis this deep or this painful since the 1930s,\u201d Obama said. \u201cBut we also knew that if we were persistent, if we kept at it and kept working, that we\u2019d gradually get to where we need to be.\u201d Obama trumpets jobs record Obama touts job record, says more remains to be done At a campaign event in Las Vegas, Romney noted that unemployment rose slightly and remained above 8% for a 42nd straight month despite Obama\u2019s campaign promise four years ago that it would be lower. Romney hits July jobs report as a \u2018moral failure\u2019 \u201cThis continues a pattern of American families really struggling, having hard times, and the president\u2019s to blame for not having gotten the economy back on track,\u201d Romney said after the event, which was held in an area where unemployment is above the national average. \u201cA lot of people are suffering in this country,\u201d he continued. \u201cI think it\u2019s an extraordinary failure of policy, a failure of leadership, and I think it\u2019s a moral failure for a country as successful and prosperous as our own to go now four years in a mode which feels to many people as a recession.\u201d With three months until November\u2019s general election, the jobs reports take on particular significance, as voters consider the economy in general and high unemployment in particular to be their most important  issues. The July figures announced Friday showed an increase in the unemployment rate to 8.3%, which hurts Obama on the issue, but also showed a net job creation of 163,000, all in the private sector. The public sector continues to be a drag on overall hiring, with the government cutting 9,000 jobs last month while private businesses added 172,000. While well below the level needed for a full recovery, the growth put Obama within reach of having an overall positive jobs record by the time voters go to the polls on November 6. Obama closer to breaking even on jobs Since Obama took office, 4.316 million jobs were lost in the first 13 months of his presidency, with 4 million net jobs now added back. If the economy adds more than 316,000 jobs in the next three months \u2013 an average of just over 105,300 per month \u2013 Obama will be able to claim the title of job creator on Election Day. Republicans rejected any such notion Friday. \u201cPresident Obama\u2019s only plans for a second term are higher taxes and more spending \u2013 exactly the opposite of what we need,\u201d said a statement by Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus. Romney also dismissed any idea that Obama is leading the nation in the right economic direction, calling the latest jobs number a \u201chammer blow to struggling middle-class families.\u201d Romney promises 12 million jobs in four years On another matter, Romney again rejected calls to release more of his past tax returns and denied a claim by Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, that an unidentified former associate of Romney\u2019s had said Romney \u2013 a multimillionaire \u2013 paid no taxes in past years. Romney to Reid: \u2018Put up or shut up\u2019 \u201cI have paid taxes every year, and a lot of taxes \u2026 so Harry is simply wrong, and that\u2019s why I\u2019m so anxious for him to give us the names of the people who\u2019ve put this forward,\u201d Romney told reporters, calling the tax return issue a Democratic effort to divert attention from a bad economy under Obama. Romney also promoted his five-point plan introduced Thursday as part of simplified messaging advocated by some Republican strategists. The proposals are traditional conservative stances on domestic energy production, trade, job training, deficit reduction and boosting small businesses. Romney unveils simplified campaign message \u201cMy plan will turn things around and bring the economy roaring back, with 12 million new jobs created by the end of my first term,\u201d he said in a statement released Friday morning in response to the jobs report. At the White House, Obama took aim at the tax component of the Romney plan, repeating criticism from earlier this week that a new study showed the proposal would mean large tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans and higher taxes for the middle class. Such a policy amounts to \u201cupside down economics,\u201d Obama said. \u201cI just think we\u2019ve got our priorities skewed if the notion is that we give tax breaks to folks who don\u2019t need it, and to help pay for that, we tax folks who\u2019re already struggling to get by,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s not how you grow an economy.\u201d Obama repeated his call for House Republicans to follow the Senate and pass a measure extending tax cuts on income up to $250,000 for families and $200,000 for individuals. The Bush tax cuts from 2001 and 2003 are set to expire at the end of the year, and Obama says they should be extended only for lower- and middle-income Americans. This week, the House rejected the plan passed by Senate Democrats and instead approved a measure extending all the Bush tax cuts,which Obama called \u201cdisappointing.\u201d House passes Republican tax-cut plan \u201cAt a time when too many working families are already struggling to make ends meet, they want to give millionaires and billionaires and folks like me tax cuts that we don\u2019t need and that the country can\u2019t afford, even if middle-class families have to pick up the tab for it,\u201d he said. Romney and Republicans want to extend all the Bush tax cuts for now to prevent any increase, while Obama says the lower rates should not continue for the wealthiest 2% of Americans to bring more fairness to the system and save money. Both sides call for comprehensive tax reform after the election as part of necessary deficit reduction steps. The issue touches on the foundations of the nation\u2019s political divide, with Republicans driven by their conservative base seeking to shrink government to reduce deficits, while Democrats want a blend of spending cuts and more tax revenue in order to maintain what they consider essential services and entitlement programs. Romney later told reporters that he wanted Obama and Congress to agree now on interim measures that would provide whoever wins the election with a six-month or one-year \u201crunway\u201d to come up with tax reform and deficit reduction policies. Under last year\u2019s debt ceiling agreement, the government faces steep mandatory spending cuts in January if Congress fails to reach a comprehensive deficit reduction agreement. The mandated cuts, which include military spending, would come at the same time the Bush tax cuts expire if no action is taken. Can Congress get out of the economy\u2019s way? Romney outlined his tax policy as lowering rates across the board while eliminating some exemptions for high-income taxpayers. He rejected the accusation by Obama and a report by the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center that his plan would mean higher taxes on middle-income Americans. \u201cI want to lower the taxes paid by middle-income Americans,\u201d Romney said. \u201cI will not raise taxes on the American people.\u201d However, Romney and his advisers say specifics of the plan \u2013 such as which exemptions would be eliminated and other details \u2013 would be worked out only when the proposals are fully formulated in a Romney administration. Romney\u2019s campaign rejected the Tax Policy Center report as biased for not including the impact of job creation under the Romney tax plan in its findings, and noted a former Obama economic adviser was one of the three authors. Obama and his campaign responded that another of the report\u2019s authors was an economic adviser to former President George H.W. Bush, and that tax cut policies proposed by Romney failed to spark job creation under President George W. Bush. Meanwhile, Romney refused to provide any further information Friday when asked about naming a running mate, giving his usual response that the announcement will occur by the third day of the Republican convention at the end of August.

            "article_content": "NEW: Mitt Romney appears on stage with some potential VP nominees Romney lays out a five-point plan for the country President Obama ridicules what he calls Republican \"tax cut fairy dust\" Both candidates campaign Thursday in battleground states President Barack Obama and Republican candidate Mitt Romney traded accusations on tax policy Thursday, with both claiming at campaign stops in battleground states that the other\u2019s strategies have failed. Romney used a rally in Golden, Colorado, to unveil a simplified campaign message called for by some Republican strategists, laying out a five-point plan that he said would put the nation back on the correct economic path. The proposals are traditional conservative stances on domestic energy production, trade, job training, deficit reduction and boosting small businesses, with Romney promising that, if elected, he would deliver on them to unleash the full potential of the U.S. economy. \u201cHis policies have not worked. They have not gotten America back to work again,\u201d Romney said of Obama, citing 41 straight months of unemployment over 8%. \u201cI\u2019m going to get America working again.\u201d In particular, Romney challenged Obama\u2019s call for extending lower tax rates, set to expire at the end of this year, only for income up to $250,000 for families or $200,000 for individuals, which would allow the rates on income above those marks to increase to 1990s levels. Calling that plan a tax increase, Romney said it would inhibit the job creation needed for economic growth and described the Obama policy as being \u201clike a dog trying to chase its tail.\u201d In Orlando, Florida, Obama attacked Romney\u2019s call for more tax cuts as an example of long-standing Republican policy that was most recently enacted by his predecessor, helping bring the recession that was in place when Obama took office. Blackburn: Voters want Romney on trail A new era in campaign finance The \"secret weapon\" of a candidate Obama authorizes support for Syria rebels \u201cThey have tried to sell us tax cut fairy dust before,\u201d Obama said. \u201cIt is not a plan to move our economy forward. It takes us backward to a place we don\u2019t need to be.\u201d Obama blasts Romney tax plan in Ohio The president also made a campaign visit to Virginia, while Romney joined Republican governors \u2013 including several potential running mates \u2013 at an Aspen, Colorado, conference. In a format resembling a celebrity \u201croast\u201d \u2013 but one with blue blazers and verbal bouquets instead of vulgar put-downs \u2013 the seated governors rose one-by-one to praise Romney. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie called Romney a man of \u201cfabulous ingenuity\u201d and \u201cgreat integrity.\u201d \u201cWe need you, we\u2019re looking forward to your services as president,\u201d said Gov. Mary Fallin of Oklahoma. \u201cI really appreciate your focus on middle class families,\u201d Virginia Gov. Bob McDonnell told Romney. In a hint that Romney\u2019s decision on a running mate might come soon, his longtime adviser Beth Myers, who heads up the campaign\u2019s search for a vice presidential candidate, will be traveling with Romney to Colorado. Polls show that Romney and Obama are statistically even in Colorado and Virginia, while Obama holds a small lead in Florida. All three states are among the eight or so considered vital to the chances of both candidates in November. The CNN Electoral Map Reviving the American dream of equal opportunity has been the central theme of Obama\u2019s campaign, and Romney\u2019s new five-point message Thursday was an effort to blunt the president\u2019s middle class outreach. In general, it rehashes Romney\u2019s previously stated stances on energy, taxes, deficit reduction, trade and small business development but offers few details For example, the energy component involves easing regulations to expand domestic production of oil, coal and natural gas. A conference call by Romney\u2019s advisers made no mention of alternative sources such as solar or wind energy championed by Obama, but Romney included continued pursuit of such programs in his later remarks in Colorado. The tax component came under heavy criticism from Obama, who cited a study by the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center that says Romney\u2019s proposals would provide large cuts to the very wealthy while increasing the burden on the lower and middle classes. Eric Fehrnstrom, a senior Romney campaign adviser, called the report \u201ca joke\u201d on Thursday\u2019s conference call, while Romney economic adviser Kevin Hassett said it fails to include the projected revenue increase from an expanded employment base that Romney\u2019s policies would bring. \u201cEliminating that from your analysis means you\u2019re going to have a very, very biased result,\u201d Hassett said. Romney officials also complained that one of the study\u2019s three authors was a former member of Obama\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers. In his Florida remarks, Obama ridiculed the Romney team\u2019s criticism of the report, noting another of the co-authors was an economist in the administration of Republican President George H.W. Bush. \u201cThey said (the report) didn\u2019t take into account the economic growth that would result from tax cuts,\u201d Obama said, drawing laughter when he added: \u201cWe all know how well that worked the last time they tried it.\u201d Romney calls for cutting today\u2019s rates by 20% as well as eliminating the Alternative Minimum Tax and limiting current deductions, exemptions and credits available to top-level income earners. However, Romney has yet to say which specific tax breaks he plans to eliminate, and the Tax Policy Center report indicated the result of his plan would force the tax burden to shift toward lower- and middle-class Americans. In its study, the Tax Policy Center did not score Romney\u2019s plan directly, saying it lacked sufficient details. Instead, the center said the plan represented a number of Republican proposals. The Romney campaign officials said Thursday that the specifics of the tax proposal remain to be worked out, with deputy policy director Jonathan Burks adding that Romney, if elected, \u201cwould write a tax bill that would achieve those goals.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s not a question of today we have a 2,000-page tax plan,\u201d Burks said. Tax policy has become a central economic issue, with Congress deadlocked over proposals to extend most or all of the Bush-era tax cuts set to expire at the end of the year. House passes Republican tax-cut plan Romney and Republicans want to extend all the Bush tax cuts for now to prevent any increase, while Obama says the lower rates should not continue for the wealthiest 2% of Americans to bring more fairness to the system. Both sides call for comprehensive tax reform after the election as part of necessary deficit reduction steps. The issue touches on the foundations of the nation\u2019s political divide, with Republicans driven by their conservative base seeking to shrink government to reduce deficits while Democrats want a blend of spending cuts and more tax revenue in order to maintain what they consider essential services and entitlement programs. With just over three months until the November election, the race has become a contentious struggle to convince voters that the other guy would take the country in the wrong direction. In anticipation of Obama\u2019s Florida trip Thursday, the Romney campaign released a new ad in the state that blames the president for a stalling economy there. Romney ad hits Obama on Florida economy Florida, currently rated a \u201ctoss up\u201d on CNN\u2019s Electoral Map, has been hard hit by a weak housing market. Its unemployment rate of 8.6% is higher than the national average, but down from a high of 11.4% in 2010. A Quinnipiac University/CBS News/New York Times poll released Wednesday showed Obama with a 51%-45% lead in Florida, which has 29 electoral votes. Another new Romney ad Wednesday hammered Obama over unemployment and other economic problems, saying: \u201cAmericans need a change. We need a new president.\u201d Campaigns turn to economy ahead of jobs report Obama\u2019s campaign responded to the ad by citing Romney\u2019s opposition to the auto industry bailout. \u201cLet\u2019s get this straight \u2013 the very person who argued for the U.S. auto industry to go bankrupt, something that would have caused more than a million jobs lost and utter economic devastation in the Midwest, is now trying to attack the president on how it was handled?\u201d campaign spokeswoman Lis Smith said in a written statement. Meanwhile, the liberal group MoveOn.org will run a 30-second television spot in battleground states mocking the amount of money spent on Rafalca, the dressage horse competing at the London Olympics that is co-owned by Romney\u2019s wife, Ann. Looking a dressage horse in the mouth The group said the ad to air in Nevada, Ohio and Pennsylvania is told from the perspective of the horse, pointing out that the Romneys spend $77,000 a year for its upkeep. \u201cAfter Mitt Romney repeals health care and ships your jobs overseas, I daresay your life won\u2019t be nearly as pampered as mine,\u201d it concludes. \u201cAfter all, you\u2019re not one of his horses.\u201d In a statement, MoveOn.org\u2019s executive director said the group was not lampooning the horse itself. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing wrong with taking good care of a horse, but there\u2019s something messed up about a millionaire who spends twice what most Americans make in a year caring for a horse, but wants to take away people\u2019s health care and offshore their jobs,\u201d Justin Ruben wrote.

            "article_content": "Five Democrats join the Republican majority in passing the repeal measure The repeal measure has no chance of passing the Senate The vote is the latest of more than 30 House GOP attempts to undermine Obamacare Democrats say the vote is a wasted effort since the Supreme Court ruling House Republicans voted Wednesday to repeal President Barack Obama\u2019s signature health care reform law despite Democratic objections that the move was a waste of time. The vote amounted to political theater because the measure is sure to die in the Democratic-led Senate and the White House has made clear Obama would veto any repeal. Five Democrats joined the Republican majority in the 244-185 vote. Democratic leaders said a handful of their caucus members facing tough re-election battles in November might side with the Republicans on the volatile issue. Wednesday\u2019s vote was the latest of more than 30 House GOP efforts to undermine the 2010 Affordable Care Act, including previous Republican moves to repeal the measure or cut funding for various provisions. Prior to the final vote, the House rejected a Democratic motion that would have required any legislator supporting the repeal measure to give up government-provided health care. In debate on the issue this week, Democrats noted the Supreme Court ruled on June 28 to uphold the health care law\u2019s constitutionality, which they said should end talk of repeal and instead inspire bipartisan efforts to address the nation\u2019s weak economic recovery. \u201cWith millions still out of work and families struggling to make ends meet, Republicans are responding how? By voting to take away critical health care protections for people,\u201d Rep. Steny Hoyer of Maryland, the No. 2 House Democrat, told reporters. Voters: Can we move on please? Republicans, however, said the issue remains a priority for their constituents and defended the need to combat what they call a threat to patient-focused health care and the economy. \u201cIt is not a game to be played,\u201d declared House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Virginia, before the voting started. Earlier, Rep. Jeb Hensarling, R-Texas, told CNN that health care reform \u201chappens to be the seminal issue of our time.\u201d \u201cThose of us who want patient-centered health care have had two years to repeal it,\u201d Hensarling said. \u201cI think it\u2019s kind of unreasonable to think we\u2019re going to go away.\u201d Opinion polls indicate public confusion on the issue amid the sharp political divide. A CNN/ORC International poll conducted June 28-July 1 showed 52% of respondents favor all or most provisions of the health care law, while at the same time, 51% want Congress to repeal the entire measure. On both issues, Democrats were strongly in favor of keeping the law intact while Republicans were equally supportive of repealing or dismantling it. Independents reflected the conflicting findings of the poll, with 56% favoring repeal while 51% support all or most of the law\u2019s provisions. At committee hearings and on the House floor Tuesday, the debate on the repeal measure devolved into repetitive opposing claims about the health care law. \u201cThis law is historic, but for all the wrong reasons,\u201d argued Rep. Sam Graves, R-Missouri. \u201cIt reaches too far into the personal decisions of Americans and it puts a heavy burden on our economy and small businesses. It\u2019s an example of big government at its absolute worst.\u201d Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz of Florida, the Democratic National Committee chair, noted the multiple previous House votes to repeal all or part of the health reform law. \u201cIt is time to stop the tantrums, grow up, and work together on Americans\u2019 number one priority \u2013 creating jobs,\u201d she said. Another Democrat, Rep. Lynn Woolsey of California, accused Republicans of \u201cserving more baloney\u201d regarding the health care law, while GOP members complained it was Obama and Democrats who misled the public on the the measure\u2019s cost and impact. Some in Congress are urging state governments to opt out of the health care law\u2019s provisions setting up health insurance exchanges and expanding Medicaid coverage for the poor and disabled. So far, a handful of states have said they will hold off on both provisions. The exchanges will provide consumers and businesses with options for obtaining health coverage, as required under the law\u2019s individual mandate. Both the exchanges and the Medicaid expansion are intended to reduce the number of uninsured Americans. By opting out, state governments hope to avoid a possible increased financial burden as the health care law gets fully implemented beginning in 2014. Opponents of the law also want to obstruct progress on implementation as much as possible while they try to get it repealed or dismantled. \u201cIt starts a process that we believe has to be repealed because we can\u2019t afford it,\u201d conservative Sen. Jim DeMint, R-South Carolina, told CNN on Wednesday. He is leading the state opt-out effort. \u201cThe bottom line is, our country is broke,\u201d DeMint said. \u201cThis is going to cost trillions of dollars.  It\u2019s going to diminish the quality and access to health care.\u201d However, analysts and industry experts contend health care reform will happen out of necessity, whether through the Affordable Care Act or the momentum it already has created since being passed over two years ago. How are you affected by the health care ruling? Share your views in the iReport Debate According to a report by PricewaterhouseCoopers\u2019 Health Research Institute, 14 states and the District of Columbia have made \u201csignificant progress\u201d toward implementing reforms, while another 19 states have made \u201cmoderate progress,\u201d leaving 17 states \u2013 or about a third \u2013 that have yet to change their laws or take other steps toward implementation. The report, titled \u201cImplications of the U.S. Supreme Court Ruling on Healthcare,\u201d says all players in the health care industry \u2013 state governments, hospitals, insurance companies, employers and drug companies \u2013 need to participate in the emerging reform process or risk getting left behind. DeMint appeared to concede that reality Wednesday, saying the goal is to \u201cgive the states more flexibility to help individuals own their own health insurance, policies that they can keep from job to job, and hopefully into retirement. And a lot of states have begun that process.\u201d He also echoed an emerging GOP talking point that praises what Obama and Democrats sought to achieve through health care reform pushed through Congress with no Republican support. \u201cWe appreciate some of the goals of the president,\u201d DeMint said. \u201cWe need every American to have access to affordable health insurance. The best way to do that is at \u2026 the state level that respects the relationship between the patient and the doctor.\u201d Democrats also point to a state solution that worked \u2013 the health care reforms implemented by Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney when he was governor of Massachusetts. Throughout Tuesday\u2019s committee hearings and floor debate on health care reform, Democratic legislators repeatedly noted how Romney\u2019s Massachusetts plan served as a model for the federal plan Republicans seek to eliminate, including the individual mandate detested by conservatives. Romney now pledges to repeal the federal law, a necessary position for any Republican in today\u2019s hyper-partisan GOP political environment. He argues his Massachusetts law was right for the state but never intended as a federal solution, but he also calls for keeping some popular provisions of what is known as Obamacare, such as preventing insurance companies from denying coverage for pre-existing conditions. What the Supreme Court ruled on health care \u2018tax\u2019 The health care issue has been among the most divisive of Obama\u2019s presidency. Conservative anger over the measure helped launch the tea party movement, and conservative groups joined with industry groups to fund a giant public pressure campaign against the legislation. Some provisions already have brought popular benefits, such as the one on pre-existing conditions. The bulk of the health care law will take effect in 2014. In its ruling, the Supreme Court said the individual mandate \u2013 the requirement that all people have insurance \u2013 is constitutional under the government\u2019s taxing authority, and Republicans have jumped on that to characterize the provision as a tax increase on middle-class Americans. What the health care ruling means to you Obama and Democrats respond that only people who can afford health insurance but choose not to get it would have to pay, amounting to about 1% of the population. The continued GOP attacks seek to bolster public opposition to the law and force Democrats to publicly defend it. Republicans have made clear that the goal is to inspire voters to rally against the law and Obama in the November presidential election. \u201cIf you give us more elected representatives to fix this problem, we will fix this problem in 2013,\u201d House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan, R-Wisconsin, said Tuesday in an interview with CNBC. The White House formally notified House leaders on Monday that Obama will veto any repeal bill that manages to reach his desk, saying repeal \u201cwould cost millions of hard-working middle-class families the security of affordable health coverage and care they deserve.\u201d \u201cThe last thing the Congress should do is refight old political battles and take a massive step backward by repealing basic protections that provide security for the middle class,\u201d a White House statement said. But Republicans called for eliminating the law and starting over on the complex issue that affects every American. \u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019ve voted over 30 times to repeal it, defund it, replace it. And we are resolved to have this law go away and we\u2019re gonna do everything we can to stop it,\u201d House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, told reporters Tuesday.

            "article_content": "NEW: NAACP audience members say Romney's Obamacare line was mistake NEW: Another in audience says booing was inappropriate NEW: Conservatives say unpopular message shows Romney's convictions His campaign acknowledges a tough time in attracting black voters but urges dialogue Mitt Romney touted his economic and educational proposals, tailored his message to the predominantly black audience, and beat back an uncomfortable chorus of \u201cboos\u201d in an address Wednesday to the nation\u2019s oldest civil rights organization. During his speech to the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, the Republican presidential candidate stressed the need to reduce government spending: \u201cIf our goal is jobs, we have to stop spending over a trillion dollars more than we take in every year.  And so, to do that, I\u2019m going to eliminate every non-essential, expensive program I can find.  That includes \u2018Obamacare.\u2019\u201d That prompted loud boos from the audience that lasted a full 15 seconds. Romney says he \u2018expected\u2019 boos at NAACP speech Romney asks NAACP for support Romney enters political lion's den NAACP: A lot at stake in 2012 election After waiting that out, Romney responded by referencing a survey that stated that three-fourths of the Chamber of Commerce\u2019s business members said the nation\u2019s health care law make it less likely to hire people. Scot Esdaile, state president of the Connecticut NAACP who was in the audience, said he was impressed that Romney appeared before the convention but thought the Obamacare line was a mistake. \u201cWe\u2019re not falling for the health care bill is the reason why people don\u2019t have jobs,\u201d he said. \u201cPrior to the health care bill being passed, there were no jobs, and a lot of those jobs were lost under the Republican administration. \u201cI definitely don\u2019t want to go backwards, and I definitely don\u2019t want to get rid of health care. I think he was totally wrong for stating that in the speech. I think he really messed up by bringing that on the floor.\u201d The line got the opposite reaction from the right, some of whom has questioned Romney\u2019s conservative convictions. \u201cWe can see a smile break out on Romney\u2019s face, and for good reason. This gives him all sorts of instant credibility on the Right and in the middle,\u201d Ed Morrissey wrote on the conservative blog Hot Air. \u201cThe middle will be pleased to see that Romney went to the convention at all, in the face of overt hostility, plus the NAACP audience comes across as a bit immature. \u201cThe Right has doubted Romney\u2019s commitment to repealing ObamaCare at times, but this shows that Romney is willing to repeat that pledge anywhere, even when it\u2019s guaranteed to turn the audience against him.\u201d In another uncomfortable moment, Romney enumerated five items to restore the imperiled economy, including expanding trade, nurturing skilled workers and restoring economic freedom. \u201cI know the president will say he\u2019s going to do those things. But he has not. He will not. He cannot. And his last four years, in the White House, prove it definitively.  If I\u2019m president, job one for me will be creating jobs,\u201d Romney said. \u201cI submit to you this: if you want a president who will make things better in the African American community, you are looking at him.\u201d Both lines prompted separate choruses of boos. NAACP chair: \u2018They absolutely booed\u2019 Romney NAACP member Peggy Holmes said she was disappointed by the crowd\u2019s reaction, \u201cbecause I wasn\u2019t raised that way.\u201d \u201cIf I invite someone to my house, I treat them like a guest. I respect them,\u201d she said. The Obama campaign reacted swiftly. Spokeswoman Clo Ewing wrote in a statement: \u201cAt the NAACP today, leaders in the African American community recognized the devastating impact Mitt Romney\u2019s policies would have on working families. He\u2019d gut investments in education, energy, and infrastructure, and raise taxes on the middle class even as he gives $5 trillion in tax cuts weighted towards millionaires and billionaires. He\u2019d put insurance companies back in charge, threatening the health of more than 30 million Americans who will gain coverage because of the Affordable Care Act. And he refused to use the opportunity today to finally lay out a plan for improving health care or education in this country.\u201d \u201cPresident Obama believes the economy grows from the middle out, and that\u2019s why his plan would extend tax cuts for the middle class, asks the wealthiest to pay their fair share, and makes the critical investments to build an economy that lasts. African Americans can\u2019t afford Romney Economics.\u201d Romney\u2019s campaign has acknowledged its problem with African American voters: Polls show blacks overwhelmingly prefer Obama \u2013 a recent Gallup tracking poll showed just 5% of blacks supporting Romney, compared with 87% for the president. In 2008, Obama, the first African-American presidential nominee of a major U.S. political party, captured a near-total lock on the black vote: 95% to 4% for Sen. John McCain. Yet Romney sees an opening given the alarming level of unemployment among African-Americans, which recently rose from 13.6% to 14.4% \u2013 just over six points higher than the national jobless rate. A top NAACP official said that Romney could \u201csurely\u201d capture more black votes \u2013 if he offers economic proposals that appeal to the community. \u201cAfrican-Americans, like every other demographic in our country \u2026 demographics vote their economic interests,\u201d NAACP Washington bureau director, and senior vice president for policy and advocacy, Hilary Shelton said.  \u201cWe want to know that the plan that you have to address the issue of unemployment in our society will also reach us; that we\u2019ll see a tailored plan that will recognize that disparity and show us how you make sure we move the entire country forward, but also eliminate that disparity in the process.\u201d To be sure, the audience\u2019s displeasure with Romney was scant.  During the 25-minute address, the audience was mostly polite \u2013 giving their guest light applause at various moments. Romney opened with a light-hearted joke. Acknowledging a high profile opponent\u2019s appearance before the group on Thursday, Romney said: \u201cI appreciate the chance to speak first \u2013 even before Vice President Biden will get his chance tomorrow.  I just hope the Obama campaign doesn\u2019t think you\u2019re playing favorites.\u201d Romney saw applause as he confronted the political reality he faces with black voters. \u201cNow with 90% of African Americans, who typically vote for Democrats, you may wonder, or some may wonder, why a Republican would bother to campaign in the African American community and to address the NAACP,\u201d the candidate said.  \u201cOne reason of course is that I hope to represent all Americans, of every race, creed and sexual orientation.   From the poorest to the richest and everyone in between.\u201d \u201cI believe that if you understood who I truly am in my heart, and if it were possible to fully communicate what I believe is in the real, enduring best interest of African American families, you would vote for me for president.\u201d Romney confronted criticism of his economic policies. \u201cNow of course you know, the opposition charges that I and people in my party are running for office to help the rich. Nonsense,\u201d the candidate said.  \u201cThe rich will do just fine, whether I\u2019m elected or not.  The president wants to make this campaign about blaming the rich and I want to make this a campaign about helping the middle class in America.\u201d He also stood his ground against gay marriage \u2013 an issue that has received mixed responses from the African American community. \u201cAs president, I will promote strong families and I will defend traditional marriage,\u201d Romney said. At another point, the former Massachusetts governor saw warm responses by noting the historic nature of the president\u2019s election. \u201cIf someone had told us in the 1950s or 60s that a black citizen would serve as the forty-fourth president of the United States, we would have been proud and many would have been surprised,\u201d Romney said.  \u201cPicturing that day, we might have assumed that the American presidency would be the very last door of opportunity to be opened.  Before that came to pass, every other barrier on the path to equal opportunity would surely have to come down.\u201d \u201cOf course, it hasn\u2019t happened quite that way.  Many barriers remain.  Old inequities persist.  In some ways, the challenges are even more complicated than before.  And across America \u2013 and even within your own ranks \u2013 there are serious, honest debates about the way forward.\u201d Much of Romney\u2019s speech centered on his policy proposals.  On education, Romney touted his record in Massachusetts.  He also stressed the need for education reform \u2013 offering parents a choice to send their children to charter schools, \u201cwhich is a great benefit to inner city kids trapped in underperforming schools,\u201d Romney said. He also made a notable, yet veiled point about the GOP. \u201cThe Republican Party\u2019s record, by the measures you rightly apply, is not perfect.  Any party that claims a perfect record doesn\u2019t know history the way you know it.  Yet always in both parties there have been men and women of integrity, decency, and humility who have called it justice by its name.\u201d Analysts took away different views of the speech, depending on their points of view. Republican strategist and CNN contributor Anna Navarro said Romney\u2019s message was one of sticking to his convictions and expanding the GOP. I think it does send a very strong message of inclusiveness,\u201d said CNN contributor and Republican strategist Anna Navarro.  \u201cIt\u2019s not easy to go into a tough crowd and Mitt Romney is showing that he can reach out to a tough crowd. He will go in and say the same thing to different groups even if it\u2019s not popular.\u201d \u201cSo I think even all of those boos are not a bad thing because it shows that he is not pandering\u2026.This helps with swing votes, moderates, people that like to see inclusiveness.\u201d CNN contributor and Democratic strategist Donna Brazile saw it differently. \u201cLook, Mitt Romney would have gotten booed if he would have given the same speech that he gave to some of his tea party audiences, that supports voter ID and will prevent many Americans to exercise their vote,\u201d Brazile said. \u201cI think what this audience wanted to hear was job, peace, and freedom and he got a long list of promises without any details of solutions.\u201d At the end of his address, half the crowd rose and applauded Romney. Roslyn Brock, chairwoman of the NAACP national board of directors, objected to Romney\u2019s choice of the word \u201cObamacare,\u201d a buzzword coined by the law\u2019s conservative critics. \u201cThat was a loaded statement and the crowd erupted with displeasure.\u201d While Obama is skipping the convention, Vice President Joe Biden will address the group on Thursday.

The vote will be the latest of more than 30 House GOP efforts to undermine the 2010 Affordable Care Act, including previous Republican-led moves to repeal the measure or cut funding for various provisions. Any House repeal effort is sure to die in the Democratic-led Senate, and the White House made clear Obama would veto such a measure. At news conferences, in media interviews and before congressional panels on Tuesday, GOP opponents of the health care law depicted it as an unwarranted government intrusion in health decisions that would reduce patients to commodities treated on a cost basis. \u201cThis is all about the government. It is Washington knows best, and it is wrong,\u201d said House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dave Camp, R-Michigan, in floor debate ahead of the Wednesday vote. Republicans also complained that the bill known as Obamacare would fail to control spiraling health care costs, and that it included new taxes and fees despite the president\u2019s promise not to raise middle-class taxes. To Democrats, the entire exercise was an unnecessary repetition of past political posturing on a settled issue, now that the Supreme Court has upheld the law\u2019s constitutionality. \u201cThis repeal vote is a waste of time and tax dollars,\u201d said Rep. G.K. Butterfield, D-North Carolina, while Rep. Frank Pallone, D-New Jersey, noted, \u201cWe\u2019ve had this debate so many times that it really sounds like we just keep repeating the same thing.\u201d Other legislators tried to liven up the rhetoric with references to popular culture. Democrats mentioned the movie \u201cGroundhog Day,\u201d about a character forced to live the same day over and over, while Rep. Chris Murphy, D-Connecticut, likened Republican obsessiveness on the issue to the Glenn Close character in \u201cFatal Attraction.\u201d Wondering if Republicans had \u201cfinally hit their \u2018boil the bunny\u2019 moment\u201d \u2013 a gruesome incident in the film \u2013 Murphy challenged GOP colleagues to work with Democrats on moving forward \u201cinstead of channeling their inner Glenn Close.\u201d Republican Rep. Phil Gingrey of Georgia chose to compare Obama to Boss Hogg, the unethical county commissioner from \u201cThe Dukes of Hazzard\u201d television show. Gingrey stood next to a poster featuring the character\u2019s photo that said: \u201cYou can have whatever you like \u2026 as long as THE BOSS approves it.\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s get rid of the boss, once and for all,\u201d Gingrey said.

Wednesday\u2019s vote will be the first on the subject since last month\u2019s Supreme Court ruling, which Democrats argue should have ended the political debate over the health care law, rather than revive the Republican repeal effort.

William Clay, D-Missouri, told a House Oversight subcommittee hearing on the law\u2019s effect on the health care industry. \u201cYou know, their views would have been relevant since for the past five years they have been living with comprehensive health care reform, signed into law by Gov. Mitt Romney, that is substantially similar.\u201d At the hearing, the lone Democratic witness on the panel of five people who testified noted support for the health care law by major national organizations including the American Medical Association, the American Association of Pediatrics, the American College of Physicans, the AARP advocacy group for senior citizens and others. However, the witness, Ron Pollack of Families USA, was repeatedly cut off by Republicans on the panel when he responded to questions they asked him. Three times, Pollack was admonished to limit his responses to \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d by the GOP committee members. Republican witnesses, meanwhile, said the health care law would deny people medical care based on need, saying cost would be the determining factor. Dr. Dick Armstrong of Docs4PatientCare, an advocacy group opposed to the federal law, said the act destroys the doctor-patient relationship, adding: \u201cThis is the reality of Obamacare. There is no care.\u201d The GOP\u2019s conservative base strongly opposes the individual mandate in the law, which requires people to obtain health insurance or pay a fine.

            "article_content": "NEW: Obama, Romney argue over who sent more jobs overseas Obama's pitch to middle-class voters continues in Iowa GOP and Democrats are fighting to appeal to middle class voters Both campaigns must avoid political pitfalls in the messaging battle President Barack Obama, who took his renewed pitch to cut taxes for the middle class to Iowa Tuesday, and Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney ratcheted up the tense back and forth over outsourcing work overseas in an appeal to those hit hardest by the economic downturn. At its core, the debate is a fierce battle to win the support of middle class voters \u2013 especially those in battleground states. The Obama campaign continued hammering Romney over his private equity firm, Bain Capital, which \u201cowned companies that were pioneers in the practice of shipping work from the United States to overseas call centers and factories making computer components,\u201d according to a television advertisement released Saturday. Obama\u2019s campaign has also been forcefully pushing a Washington Post report that calls Romney\u2019s former private equity firm, Bain Capital, a \u201cpioneer\u201d in outsourcing jobs overseas. The campaign has made the report a focal point of its ads against Romney, and the president frequently mentions it in his stump speeches. Romney and the GOP have spent the past few days fighting back against the Obama campaign\u2019s line of attack that when the former Massachusetts governor was at Bain Capital he outsourced jobs overseas to the detriment of middle-class American workers. Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus, who was also in Iowa as part of a GOP strategy of \u201cbracketing\u201d the president\u2019s public appearances in battleground states, unveiled a new website, called ObamanomicsOutsourced.com, which the RNC said shows instances where the president\u2019s policies have led to job creation overseas. Romney addressed the issue during a stop in Grand Junction, Colorado. \u201cIt is interesting that when it comes to outsourcing that this president has been outsourcing a good deal of American jobs himself by putting money into energy companies \u2013 solar and wind energy companies that end up making their products outside the United States,\u201d Romney said.  \u201cIf there\u2019s an outsourcer-in-chief, it\u2019s the president of the United States, not the guy who\u2019s running to replace him.\u201d Romney: Obama 'outsourcer-in-chief' Romney talks middle class to rich donors Bush-era tax cuts explained In response, Obama\u2019s campaign said: \u201cPresident Obama has fought continuously to end tax breaks for companies that ship jobs overseas, fostered incentives for companies to bring jobs back to America and doubled the rate of trade enforcement actions we\u2019ve taken against China to ensure an even playing field for American workers,\u201d the statement read. In addition to Priebus\u2019 event, Romney\u2019s campaign is also pointing to a new story in The Washington Post that details criticism of Obama for allowing domestic jobs to shift overseas. \u201cAmerican jobs have been shifting to low-wage countries for years, and the trend has continued during Obama\u2019s presidency,\u201d states the article, published online Monday night. During his campaign rally in Cedar Rapids, Iowa, a state the president won by 10 points in the 2008 election, the president held a roundtable discussion with an Iowa family and then talked about middle-class tax relief at a campaign event. That message included a call to  pass a one-year extension of the Bush-era tax cuts for households making less than $250,000 a year and let cuts for wealthier Americans expire. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have two choices in this election.  And one choice is to take us down a path of top-down economics and an approach that says if we do good for folks at the very top, somehow everybody benefits,\u201d Obama told the crowd. \u201cAnd my vision, which says, when we grow best it\u2019s because our middle class is doing well and everybody who\u2019s fighting to get into the middle class.\u201d Obama\u2019s renewed push  to extend the tax cuts also serves to steer the conversation from Friday\u2019s news of relatively stagnant job growth rate and an unemployment rate of 8.2%. The mission for both candidates, political experts say, is to frame their messages in a way that makes it clear each empathizes with the plight of those who are struggling to make ends meet. Doggett: Tax breaks don't make jobs Paulsen: U.S. needs a simpler tax code Facing a tough re-election fight against Romney, the Obama campaign seeks to frame the contest as a debate between the president\u2019s goal of restoring middle-class opportunity versus GOP policies that it says would primarily benefit corporations and wealthy Americans. For Obama that message is, \u201d \u2018We\u2019re coming back. We\u2019re producing jobs and we\u2019re trying to restore fairness,\u2019 \u201d said Robert Lehrman, who was a speechwriter for dozens of Democratic political figures, including former Vice President Al Gore, and is author of \u201cThe Political Speechwriter\u2019s Companion.\u201d Romney\u2019s challenge is to shake the image of a wealthier, disconnected business executive and convince voters that his experience as a leader in his field gives him the qualifications to be the nation\u2019s leader. For Romney the message is, \u201cThere are too many people out of work and it\u2019s terrible,\u201d Lehrman said, adding that Romney needs to make clear that he \u201cfeels for the people who are having a hard time.\u201d A recent CNN/ORC International poll conducted June 28-July 1, with 1,517 adult Americans, including 1,390 registered voters, also indicates that while voters are divided on whether Obama or Romney would do a better job on the economy, Romney holds an edge among crucial independent voters in the race for the White House. Forty-eight percent of registered voters say the president would better handle the economy, with 47% saying Romney would do a better job. President Obama\u2019s re-election team is working overtime to paint Romney as someone who is rich and out of touch. The campaign has kept up the attacks on Romney over what is described as his lack of transparency. A new Web video released by the Obama campaign Tuesday claims that the presumptive GOP presidential nominee is \u201cdefying calls to release more than one year\u2019s worth of tax returns.\u201d And  at a Las Vegas speech for the National Council of La Raza convention, a large Latino civil rights group, Vice President Joe Biden continued the campaign\u2019s recent blitz against Romney over reports of his offshore investments. In January, Romney released his tax returns for 2010 and an estimate for 2011. Federal campaign law does not require candidates to release tax returns, but it does require candidates to file annual financial disclosure paperwork, which Romney has done. However, the Obama re-election team often points to Romney\u2019s father, the late George Romney, who released 12 years of tax returns when he ran for president in 1968. \u201cHis son has released one year of his tax returns. Making a lie of the old adage: Like father, like son,\u201d Biden said. As the campaigns continue the messaging slugfest, there are some pitfalls they must avoid, Lehrman said. \u201cThe worst thing for Obama to do would be to sound apologetic all the time or to say we haven\u2019t done all that we wanted to do,\u201d Lehrman said. For Romney, the worse thing \u201cwould be to concede too much to what the administration has done. But I don\u2019t think there\u2019s any chance Romney would do that.\u201d CNN\u2019s Becky Brittain, Tom Cohen, Ashley Killough, Paul Steinhauser and Jessica Yellen contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "NEW: The House and Senate will vote on differing proposals on the Bush tax cuts President Obama says extend lower tax rates only for the middle class, not the wealthy Republicans says the tax cuts should extended for everyone The tax cuts are set to expire at the end of the year President Barack Obama revitalized his push for holding down middle-class tax rates Monday, calling on Congress to pass a one-year extension of the Bush-era tax cuts for people earning less than $250,000 a year. In a White House statement delivered while people described as working Americans stood behind him, Obama said his proposal would provide the certainty of no tax increase next year for 98% of Americans. Noting that Republicans seek to maintain all of the Bush tax cuts enacted in 2001 and 2003, Obama said both sides therefore agree on extending the lower rates for middle-class families. \u201cLet\u2019s agree to do what we agree on, right?\u201d Obama said to laughter and applause in the East Room. \u201cThat\u2019s what compromise is all about.\u201d Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, indicated he would schedule a Senate vote on Obama\u2019s proposal, while House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Virginia, said the chamber would vote later this month on a one-year extension of the Bush tax cuts for everyone. White House spokesman Jay Carney told reporters Monday that Obama would veto the House version if it reached his desk. Facing a tough re-election fight against certain Republican challenger Mitt Romney, the Obama campaign seeks to frame the contest as a debate between the president\u2019s goal of restoring middle-class opportunity versus GOP policies that it says would primarily benefit corporations and wealthy Americans. Opinion: Class warfare discussion is essential Obama and other Democrats said Monday that Republicans would have to decide if protecting wealthy Americans from a tax increase was worth holding \u201chostage\u201d the extension of middle-class tax cuts. A Romney campaign official criticized Obama\u2019s announcement as more bad policy from the president in the wake of the latest disappointing jobs report. Obama: Extend Bush-era tax cuts Gibbs: Romney a pioneer in outsourcing McConnell: This is the most tepid recovery Obama pushing Congress to create jobs \u201cPresident Obama\u2019s response to even more bad economic news is a massive tax increase,\u201d said Andrea Saul, the Romney campaign\u2019s spokeswoman. \u201cIt just proves again that the president doesn\u2019t have a clue how to get America working again and help the middle class.\u201d Unlike Obama, Saul continued, Romney \u201cunderstands that the last thing we need to do in this economy is raise taxes on anyone.\u201d Republicans also complained that Obama\u2019s plan would raise taxes on more than 900,000 small-business owners who report their income in individual returns as so-called flow-through enterprises. \u201cThe proposed tax increase on 53% of all flow-through business income would be especially harmful to small businesses,\u201d said a statement by Sen. Jon Kyl, R-Arizona, a leading conservative. Obama, however, said that under his proposal, 97% of the nation\u2019s small business owners would benefit from having their lower tax rates maintained at current levels. \u201cThis isn\u2019t about taxing job creators,\u201d Obama said. \u201cThis is about helping job creators.\u201d Carney also took exception to the GOP argument, saying that the small-business people Republicans sought to protect from higher taxes included \u201cpartners in law firms or hedge-fund managers.\u201d \u201cThey\u2019re not the kind of small businesses that you and I tend to think of when we talk about small businesses,\u201d Carney said. Monday\u2019s statement was part of a new presidential push on the tax issue following the weak June jobs report that came out Friday. Congress is returning from it\u2019s weeklong Independence Day break on Monday. An Obama campaign official said his re-election team will \u201camplify the president\u2019s message on middle-class tax cuts\u201d by hosting a series of events this week in battleground states. In Las Vegas, for example, local elected officials will discuss Obama\u2019s efforts to fight for the middle class, the campaign official said. In Colorado, Aspen Mayor Mick Ireland, Colorado Democratic Party Chair Rick Palacio and state Sen. Gail Schwartz will hold a news conference to discuss the contrasting economic visions of Obama and Romney. Obama signed a bill in 2010 to extend all of the Bush-era tax cuts until the end of 2012, citing the need for economic stimulus at the time. He has since vowed he would not permit another extension of the lower tax rates for wealthy Americans. His proposal Monday would maintain the current lower tax rates for families making up to $250,000 for another year while allowing tax rates to return to 1990s levels for those earning more. The president sounded major themes of his re-election campaign, saying his goal was \u201cputting people back to work but also rebuilding an economy where that work pays off.\u201d He blamed a political stalemate in Congress for the failure to take decisive steps toward addressing rising deficits and other economic issues, saying he and Democrats disagreed with what he called \u201ctop down\u201d policies of Republicans who favor tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans. \u201cI believe our prosperity has always come from an economy that\u2019s built on a strong and growing middle class,\u201d Obama said, noting that he has cut middle class taxes as president. \u201c\u2026 So that\u2019s why I believe it\u2019s time to let the tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans, folks like myself, to expire.\u201d Extend the tax cuts for the middle class now, the president said, and then let the result of the November election decide the debate on broader tax reform, including how much the wealthy should pay On Sunday, top Obama campaign adviser Robert Gibbs told CNN that the president was \u201c100% committed\u201d to ending the Bush tax cuts for the wealthy. The tax breaks are set to expire in what has become known as the \u201cfiscal cliff,\u201d a package of spending cuts and the removal of tax breaks that will take place on January 1 if Congress fails to act. In total, they could add up to $7 trillion. Tax breaks that would end include the Bush tax cuts, middle-class protection from the Alternative Minimum Tax and more than 50 \u201ctemporary\u201d tax breaks for individuals and businesses that have been on the books for years. Should the rich pay more taxes? Share your thoughts in the iReport Debate Obama also has backed the so-called Buffett Rule, named after billionaire investor Warren Buffett,  which would impose a minimum 30% tax rate on those making more than $1 million. The measure was blocked by Senate Republicans in April. Republicans say the solution to the country\u2019s deficit problems should focus on shrinking the size of government, rather than raising taxes on anyone. \u201cIn the wake of another weak jobs report, the president is doubling down on his quixotic call for the same small businesses tax hikes that have been routinely rejected by the House and Senate,\u201d House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, said in a statement Monday. \u201cHow will these small business tax hikes create jobs?\u201d Opinion: 3 bipartisan bills that could get the economy moving Middle class taxes may rise anyway CNN\u2019s Ashley Killough and CNNMoney\u2019s Jeanne Sahadi contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "NEW: A conservative group launches a new ad campaign against Obama President Barack Obama cites continued growth in brief reference to job numbers \"His policies have not worked,\" certain GOP nominee Mitt Romney says of Obama Obama wraps up a two-day bus tour to key battleground states President Barack Obama downplayed a weak jobs report Friday as he wrapped up a two-day bus tour to critical states in the November election, while Republicans pounced on the news to declare the president\u2019s policies have failed. Stock prices plunged on the report that the economy created 80,000 jobs in June, well below the number needed to bring down the 8.2% unemployment rate. At a campaign event in Poland, Ohio, Obama said the job growth \u2013 while smaller than needed \u2013 continued a trend that has added 4.4 million jobs in the past 28 months following what he called \u201cthe worst economic crisis of our lifetime.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s a step in the right direction,\u201d Obama contended. Republicans, however, called the weak growth a result of Obama policies that don\u2019t work. Romney: Jobs report a 'kick in the gut' June jobs report disappoints Dueling Obama, Romney bus tours Landrieu: President Obama doing good job Romney clarifies health care positions Certain GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney called the jobs figures a \u201ckick in the gut for middle-class families,\u201d blaming Obama\u2019s policies for continued high unemployment and saying it was \u201ctime for Americans to choose whether they want more of the same.\u201d \u201cHis policies have not worked,\u201d Romney said at a brief news conference in New Hampshire, where he is vacationing with his family. Referring to more than three years of unemployment higher than 8%, Romney said \u201cthe evidence is in, again and again and again\u201d and added that the continuing high unemployment rate \u201cpretty much defines lack of success.\u201d Other Republican leaders echoed Romney\u2019s remarks, with House Speaker John Boehner taking a jab at Obama\u2019s comment last month that when compared to public sector job creation, the private sector was \u201cdoing fine.\u201d \u201cToday\u2019s report shows the private sector clearly isn\u2019t \u2018doing fine\u2019 and that President Obama\u2019s policies have failed,\u201d Boehner, R-Ohio, said in a statement. Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus\u2019 statement said, \u201cThe Obama economy is defined by chronically high unemployment.\u201d Also Friday, an independent group co-founded by conservative operative Karl Rove said it was launching a new ad targeting what it claimed were Obama\u2019s excuses for the bad economy. Crossroads GPS said the spot was the first wave of a $25 million ad buy starting July 10 and running through early August in Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Michigan, North Carolina, New Hampshire, Nevada, Ohio and Virginia \u2013 all swing states that both Democrats and Republicans will heavily contest in the presidential election. In speeches in Ohio and Pennsylvania to conclude the bus tour, Obama referred to the negative ads by Republicans and told supporters not to get discouraged. \u201cYou\u2019ll hear the same thing from them over and over again, because they know that their economic theory isn\u2019t going to sell,\u201d the president told a Pittsburgh event. \u201cSo all they\u2019ve got to argue is the economy\u2019s not moving as fast as it needs to.  Jobs aren\u2019t growing as fast as they need to.  And it\u2019s all Obama\u2019s fault. That\u2019s basically their only message.\u201d Obama briefly mentioned the new jobs report in Ohio and didn\u2019t refer to it specifically in Pittsburgh. Instead, his full-fledged campaign speeches emphasized restoring opportunity for the middle class, in contrast to what he characterized as Republican policies that favor corporations and the wealthy. In Ohio, Obama joked with the crowd, kissed at least one baby and outlined his vision of middle-class opportunity while making sure to note his administration\u2019s help in reviving the U.S. auto industry, which is big in the state. He rebuffed GOP criticism that his policies are wrong, blaming political stalemate in Washington for the failure by Congress to pass needed job creation measures he has endorsed, such as ending tax breaks for companies that send jobs overseas. \u201cThis election is about how we break that stalemate,\u201d Obama said. \u201cIt\u2019s in your power to break the stalemate.\u201d House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi, meanwhile, accused congressional Republicans of obstructing economic progress by focusing on partisan politics, such as a planned House vote next week to repeal the health care reform law in what would be a purely symbolic gesture. \u201cIt\u2019s time for Republicans to abandon their agenda of obstruction and delay, and work with Democrats to create jobs and strengthen the middle class,\u201d said a statement by Pelosi, D-California. Republicans accuse Democrats of similar tactics against measures passed by the GOP-majority House that have died in the Democratic-controlled Senate. However, former Republican presidential candidate Jon Huntsman publicly criticized his party Friday for failing to focus \u201con a bigger, bolder, more confident future for the United States \u2013 future based on problem solving, inclusiveness, and a willingness to address the trust deficit, which is every bit as corrosive as our fiscal and economic deficits.\u201d In a statement announcing he won\u2019t attend the GOP convention in August, Huntsman called for \u201ca return to the party we have been in the past, from Lincoln right on through to Reagan, that was always willing to put our country before politics.\u201d After Obama returns to Washington on Friday afternoon, he will sign a giant transportation bill that includes funding for road and bridge construction and repairs \u2013 a component of Obama\u2019s jobs plan that Congress passed last week as part of a package that included holding down interest rates on federal student loans. Both components were top priorities for Obama and passed after lengthy negotiations in Congress that were delayed by partisan posturing. All polling so far shows a tight race between Obama and Romney, and that voters consider the economy the top issue. Obama contends the economy continues to show slow growth after the deep recession he inherited, while Romney argues the president\u2019s policies deter job creation. In his remarks Friday, Romney specified what he called excessive corporate taxes and regulatory burdens as the main culprits. \u201cThe president\u2019s policies have not got America working again,\u201d Romney said. \u201cThe president\u2019s going to have to stand up and take responsibility for it.\u201d Obama, however, said the policies espoused by Romney and Republicans \u2013 such as cutting taxes and removing regulations \u2013 failed under the Bush administration and only would help the rich get richer while keeping the middle class stagnant or worse. \u201cWe saw us fighting two wars on a credit card,\u201d Obama said of what happened before he took office. \u201cThe tax cuts turned a surplus into a deficit and the lack of regulation resulted in what happened on Wall Street and we ended up with the biggest crisis we have ever seen. It ain\u2019t right. It is not a smart theory.\u201d At the heart of the issue are the differing philosophies of the two parties, with Obama and Democrats advocating a combination of strategic spending, increased revenue and entitlement reforms to reduce budget deficits and the national debt while Romney and Republicans focus on shrinking government. Health care reform also has emerged as a major point of contention, especially after last week\u2019s Supreme Court ruling that upheld the signature legislation of Obama\u2019s presidency so far. The Romney campaign has been dogged by conflicting stances on the issue, which is a vulnerability for the former Massachusetts governor who implemented a similar plan in the state but now calls for repeal of the federal law known as Obamacare. GOP leaders emphasized that the high court ruling that the law\u2019s most controversial section \u2013 the individual mandate requiring people to have health insurance \u2013 amounted to a kind of tax was evidence that Obama deceived the nation in 2009 by denying it was a tax increase. However, a top Romney adviser \u2013 seeking to protect the candidate from Democratic charges that he implemented a similar tax increase in Massachusetts \u2013 insisted that the individual mandate was not a tax but a penalty, as argued by Obama. Romney then had to declare publicly that the Supreme Court ruling means the mandate is a tax, but added more confusion by making clear he disagreed with the high court decision. Obama kept up the pressure on Romney on the issue, assailing him in an interview airing Friday for reversing his position on the penalty provision. A short portion of the interview was distributed by Obama\u2019s campaign early Friday. The remainder of the interview with WLWT-TV in Cincinnati was not immediately available. Romney \u201cwas one of the biggest promoters of the individual mandate,\u201d Obama said in the interview. \u201cIn Massachusetts, his whole idea was that we shouldn\u2019t have people who can afford to get health insurance to not buy it and then force you or me, or John Q. Public to have to pay for him when he gets sick.\u201d Now, Obama said, Romney\u2019s reversal from \u201cpenalty\u201d to \u201ctax\u201d raises the question of \u201care you doing that because of politics?\u201d \u201cAre you abandoning a principle that you fought for, for six years simply because you\u2019re getting pressure for two days from Rush Limbaugh or some critics in Washington?\u201d Obama said. Romney\u2019s campaign responded that Obama \u201ctold the American people that Obamacare was not a new tax, then sent his lawyers to convince the Supreme Court that it was a new tax, and now is insisting \u2013 again \u2013 that it is not a tax.\u201d \u201cAmericans deserve straight answers from their president,\u201d a campaign statement said. When asked about the issue, Romney said Friday that he always maintained that health care should be managed at the state level, like his program in Massachusetts, rather than at the federal level under Obamacare. Obama\u2019s solicitor general argued before the Supreme Court in March that the individual mandate could be viewed as constitutional under Congress\u2019 taxation power. Donald Verrilli said the fee would be collected by the Internal Revenue Service on April 15, the day Americans pay their federal income taxes. Asked by Associate Justice Samuel Alito \u201ccan the mandate be viewed as a tax?\u201d Verrilli responded, \u201cI think it could.\u201d In his speech at the Ohio school, Obama raised the issue again, saying to cheers that including the individual mandate with its penalty provision was the right thing to do. \u201cI make no apologies for it,\u201d the president said.

            "article_content": "The economy added 80,000 jobs in June, just 3,000 more than in May Political experts say voters care more about which candidate offers the better long-term plan A jobs report due just days before the November 6 general election is critical When Deanna Hubbard serves up steaming plates of scrambled eggs and bacon at Ann\u2019s Place in Akron, Ohio, she isn\u2019t thinking about how the ailing economy affects the presidential race or any of the other chatter from politicos who followed President Barack Obama to the Ohio eatery Friday. She doesn\u2019t have time to think about the economic picture because she\u2019s too busy living it. The economy is \u201cdoing bad. Right now, we\u2019ve been blessed, but the economy has taken a toll on us with the food prices and delivery prices and people losing their homes,\u201d Hubbard said, near breathless from racing from table to table after the president\u2019s visit caused a spike in business. The economy added only 80,000 jobs in June, just 3,000 more than in May, according to figures the Labor Department reported Friday. Though the 8.2% unemployment rate is lower than it has been in the last three Junes, the slow job growth does not bode well for Obama. Romney: Jobs report a 'kick in the gut' Obama: Jobs report in 'right direction' June jobs report disappoints But some political experts say that what\u2019s more important than month-to-month jobs numbers is a candidate who offers a better long-term plan for recovery. \u201cFrankly, I think no matter who had been president, the last four years we would have seen very sluggish recovery. It\u2019s normal after a financial crisis, but there is a question of where things are going from here,\u201d Ken Rogoff, an economics and public policy professor at Harvard University and former International Monetary Fund chief economist, told Soledad O\u2019Brien on CNN\u2019s \u201cStarting Point\u201d on Friday. \u201cWhat are the job numbers going to look like the next four years? And I think that\u2019s what the debate has to be around. There are, of course, two very different visions for the economy between candidate Romney and President Obama, between growth and perhaps more fairness.\u201d In Ohio, a swing state that had an unemployment rate of 7.3% in May, the question of \u201cwhere things are going from here\u201d is important. Just before the flat job-growth numbers were released, the president spoke with diners who worked at Goodyear Tire & Rubber, which is headquartered in Akron, and toured the Summer Garden Food Manufacturing plant, which makes pasta sauce, in Boardman, Ohio. Later, the president addressed the tepid job growth in a speech to a gathering of a few hundred at an elementary school gym in Poland, Ohio. The president highlighted the economy\u2019s slow but steady recovery under his watch, such as businesses creating \u201c4.4 million new jobs over the past 28 months, including 500,000 new manufacturing jobs,\u201d and a government program to shore up the ailing U.S. auto industry. Obama also acknowledged that \u201cIt is still tough out there.\u201d Meanwhile, across the country in Wolfeboro, New Hampshire, Republican challenger Mitt Romney called the jobs figures \u201canother kick in the gut to middle-class families.\u201d \u201cThe president\u2019s policies have not gotten America working again, and the president is going to have to stand up and take responsibility for it,\u201d he said. Romney\u2019s economic recovery plan includes reducing the corporate income tax rate and curbing some of the regulatory policies he says have driven up energy costs, among other measures to help whittle down the unemployment rate. Rogoff says there are things that can boost the economy, such as nixing many tax exemptions, rebuilding the nation\u2019s infrastructure and improving the education system. \u201cThere are a lot of things we can do. The U.S. is a fantastic franchise, but this political paralysis that we\u2019ve had between the Congress and president that\u2019s been going on for a long time has been leaving the economy drifting in the wind,\u201d he told O\u2019Brien. The June jobs figures may make news now, but presidential candidates and voters will be more closely watching a critical jobs report due just days before the November 6 general election, said Tom Smith, an assistant professor at Emory University\u2019s Goizueta Business School. If there\u2019s an uptick in jobs creation just before the election, Obama is in good stead. But a downtick could bode well for Romney, Smith said. \u201cThere are two things that are going to impact this election: the unemployment rate and jobs creation \u2026\u201d Smith said. \u201cPeople are looking for things to get better.\u201d People like Deanna Hubbard. \u201cPeople don\u2019t have the money to eat,\u201d she said. \u201cThe older people are having to choose between eating and buying their medicines.\u201d",

            "article_content": "First reaction to health care ruling was shock, GOP sources say But as tax angle became clear, they saw a potential political win GOP talking points now revolve around criticizing health mandate as a tax As House Speaker John Boehner sat with the top House GOP leaders and aides in his office Thursday morning watching TV news reports that the Supreme Court had upheld President Barack Obama\u2019s health care law, the initial reaction was shock. Republican leaders were prepared for the various outcomes the high court might issue, according to House GOP sources in the meeting, but they were caught off guard when they learned conservative Chief Justice John Roberts was the deciding vote. Emotions high after Supreme Court upholds health care law But as the details sank in and they read the surprising legal explanation written by Roberts, they realized they might have lost at the court but won politically. The chief justice decided that the individual mandate in the law that required Americans to carry health insurance was a tax, which Congress was allowed to levy. Republicans seized on that argument and planned to turn it to their advantage. The high court had just validated one of the main points the GOP made against the health care bill throughout the 2009 debate.  It served up a message they could hammer from now until Election Day: Democrats want to tax Americans and unless you put Mitt Romney in the White House and vote for a GOP House and Senate, they will do it again. Massachusetts health care mandate included tax penalty Boiling down the health care decision, Boehner told reporters a couple of hours later, \u201cThe government could decide that we\u2019re going to tax you if you don\u2019t eat broccoli on Tuesday.  Apparently, that\u2019s not unconstitutional.  But I don\u2019t think it\u2019s a very wise law.\u201d Ruling cements Obama\u2019s political legacy, experts say Republican leaders announced they would follow through on their pledge to repeal the law, or any piece of it, if it was upheld.  House Majority Leader Eric Cantor said on his way into a meeting with rank and file members in the Capitol basement that the House would again vote to roll back the health care law \u2013 as it did in January \u2013 right after it returned from its weeklong Fourth of July recess. Court ruling pumps up tea partiers The closed-door meeting to discuss the court\u2019s ruling was described as \u201ca little bit somber\u201d by Idaho Republican Rep. Raul Labrador.  He said the court\u2019s decision \u201cwas a little bit surprising.\u201d But Labrador quickly pivoted to the tax message: \u201cThe bottom line is that the Supreme Court has said now that Congress has the authority and power to tax everyone for anything at any time, and the American people should be afraid of that.\u201d During the health care debate in 2009, President Obama argued that the individual mandate was not a tax.  In an interview with ABC, Obama said, \u201cFor us to say that you\u2019ve got to take a responsibility to get health insurance is absolutely not a tax increase.  What it\u2019s saying is, is that we\u2019re not going to have other people carrying your burdens for you anymore than the fact that right now everybody in America, just about, has to get auto insurance. Nobody considers that a tax increase.\u201d Freshman Republican Rep. Dave Schweikert of Arizona pointed to that argument from the president, which he said his Democratic opponent \u2013 then-Rep. Harry Mitchell \u2013 also made arguing the mandate was not a tax. \u201cWe have a White House and we have a Democratic Party that moved this forward swearing it wasn\u2019t, now we see the truth,\u201d Schweikert said. Seizing on Roberts\u2019 ruling, the House GOP\u2019s campaign arm splashed a picture on its Facebook page on Friday \u2013 the one snapped in 2010 when Vice President Biden famously hugged President Obama during a White House ceremony when he signed the health care bill and called it \u201ca big f\u2014ing deal.\u201d   But the caption on the GOP\u2019s version read, \u201cThis is a Big F***ing Tax.\u201d Rep. Pete Sessions of Texas, who heads the National Republican Congressional Committee, told reporters Friday that GOP candidates will make a major issue of the court\u2019s proclamation that the health care mandate amounted to a tax. \u201cChief Justice Roberts has now distinguished and I think highlighted it \u2013 this is a tax and Congress has an ability to tax you,\u201d Sessions said.  He added, \u201cWe will call it what it is \u2013 it is a tax.\u201d Sessions said talking about the threat of new taxes works hand-in-hand with the GOP\u2019s focus on the economy. Perhaps previewing what could show up in campaign spots, he said there would be \u201c17,000 IRS agents who will be added to the workforce for the sole purpose of enforcing this tax.\u201d Republican congressional aides had already planned to make repealing health care a centerpiece of their fall campaign message.  But Roberts\u2019 decision gave them new ammunition and talking points in an area \u2013 taxes \u2013 where public opinion polls frequently show the Democratic Party can be vulnerable. House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi wouldn\u2019t directly answer when asked by a reporter on Thursday about the court\u2019s ruling that the mandate in the health care law was a tax. \u201cCall it what you will, it is a step forward for America\u2019s families,\u201d Pelosi said.  She downplayed the new debate over Roberts\u2019 decision as \u201cWashington talk\u201d and emphasized the benefits of the law for those with pre-existing conditions who will now be able to get coverage. Pressed if she was concerned about political fallout, Pelosi brushed off the question, telling reporters, \u201cThe politics be damned, this is about what we came to do.\u201d While the GOP moved to reframe the debate over health care, Democrats criticized Republicans for ignoring the economy and re-fighting a battle from two years ago. The Democratic campaign committee blasted out press releases about the 60 House Republicans it is targeting in November. Jesse Ferguson, the spokesman for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, said of freshman Rep. Sean Duffy, R-Wisconsin, \u201cRather than working to create jobs by strengthening the middle class, Congressman Duffy wants to put insurance companies back in charge of health care: taking away critical patient protections, denying coverage to people with pre-existing conditions like asthma, heart disease or cancer and raising prescription drug costs for seniors.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Republicans confident recall results signal state will turn red in November GOP certainly laid vital groundwork that could put the state in play this fall But Republicans are still working against historical forces in Wisconsin Republicans scored a decisive victory Tuesday in the bitter Wisconsin recall election as Gov. Scott Walker beat back Democratic challenger Tom Barrett and his organized labor allies to keep his seat in Madison. But will it matter in November? Unfortunately for a pundit class that has been eager to ascribe sweeping national meaning to a race that hinged entirely on local issues, the answer is\u2026 maybe. National GOP officials, eager to make hay out of the results, claim otherwise. What's next for Gov. Walker? Walker: 'Time to move Wisconsin forward' Milwaukee mayor loses recall vote Walker\u2019s Wisconsin win big blow to unions, smaller one to Obama \u201cIt\u2019s a lean-red state right now,\u201d boasted Republican National Committee chairman Reince Priebus, a Kenosha native. \u201cThere is not a state in all of America where Republicans know more about every voter than Wisconsin,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cAnd this was a message election about spending and debt and the size of government. That will be the central question of November.\u201d Republicans certainly laid vital groundwork that will put the state in play this fall if Mitt Romney and his allies choose to spend money here, a likely prospect considering the Republican National Committee is chaired by a Wisconsinite. Working hand-in-hand with the state Republican Party, the RNC used the recall effort to identify four million potential voters, an invaluable achievement in a state where people do not register by party. Door-to-door canvassers used iPads, iPhones and iPods to feed voter information directly back to the RNC\u2019s data center in Washington. The party also opened 24 volunteer centers statewide to assist in the Walker effort, and all of those offices will be converted into presidential victory centers beginning Wednesday. The Obama campaign, meanwhile, has about 20 offices in Wisconsin, though its renowned field organizers have been on the ground for much longer, especially in Obama-friendly college towns and urban centers. As for Romney, he mostly tiptoed around the recall fight like the president, declining to campaign in the state for Walker. But the presumptive Republican presidential nominee is likely to make an appearance in the state soon, sources tell CNN. Romney tried to jump on Walker\u2019s coattails late Tuesday with a congratulatory tweet, saying the results \u201cwill echo beyond the borders of Wisconsin.\u201d Romney reacts to Wisconsin recall vote A range of national conservative groups, from the Karl Rove-backed American Crossroads to the Republican Governors Association to the Tea Party Patriots, seized on the outcome to proclaim victory over organized labor and tie the results to Obama\u2019s re-election chances. \u201cThis is a victory for keeping promises and delivering results for working families, and a defeat for the broken politics of Barack Obama and big government unions,\u201d said American Crossroads president Steven Law. \u201cOn to November!\u201d To be sure, Obama now faces a greater challenge in Wisconsin than he did in 2008, when he thumped John McCain here by 14 points. A recent poll from Marquette University Law School showed the president with a 49% favorable rating in the state, a poor showing, but still better than Romney\u2019s 40%. The final result in Wisconsin come November may look more like it did in 2000, when Al Gore bested George W. Bush by 4,500 votes, or 2004, when John Kerry beat Bush by 11,000 votes. \u201cWisconsin has always been a battleground,\u201d said state Sen. Lena Taylor, a Democrat representing parts of Milwaukee. \u201cWe are red with blue polka dots or blue with red polka dots. You really can\u2019t tell who has the majority because it flips and it changes all the time.\u201d But despite their mechanical advances and the base-energizing power of the recall, Republicans are still working against historical forces in Wisconsin. The state has not voted for a Republican on the presidential level since 1984. And if the GOP wants to use Tuesday\u2019s election as an omen for November, they can\u2019t ignore Obama\u2019s strong showing in exit polls. Even with turnout lower than it was in 2008 \u2013 and lower than it is expected to be this November \u2013 voters who participated in the recall told exit pollsters they preferred Obama to Romney by a 51-44 margin. Obama also bested Romney on questions of which candidate would do more to help the middle class and improve the economy. \u201cIf Mitt Romney couldn\u2019t beat the President among the electorate that turned out today to reelect Walker, or with a spending gap that favored the GOP, he faces an incredibly steep path in November,\u201d an Obama campaign official noted. Rank-and-file Republicans who volunteered for Walker in the race\u2019s closing days differed on whether a recall win would translate to a Romney victory this fall. \u201cPeople are fired up, and I think it\u2019s going to make a huge difference,\u201d said Jeff Komp, an insurance broker from Erin Township who backed Walker. \u201cIt\u2019s going to carry forward and help the momentum in November.\u201d Jennifer Passig, a Walker supporter from Cedarburg who made get-out-the-vote phone calls for the governor, had a different take. \u201cI think if Romney sticks the course he will have a lot of support here, but I just don\u2019t know if he will win the state,\u201d she said. \u201cWe always seem to have Republican governors and Democratic governors. I don\u2019t know why. It\u2019s really strange.\u201d This weekend\u2019s Wisconsin Democratic Convention in Appleton is certain to be consumed by hand-wringing and second-guessing about the recall, a grim prospect for one of the convention\u2019s guest speakers: Democratic National Committee Chairman Debbie Wasserman Schultz, who may face questions about why national Democrats did not do more to help Barrett. Democrats at Barrett\u2019s election night headquarters searched for silver linings in the loss, arguing that the recall race engaged their party\u2019s base even as Democrats were outspent by Walker and outside conservative groups by a 7-1 margin. But others admitted that the loss was a painful blow for a party that was brimming with confidence just hours earlier. Mahlon Mitchell, a union leader who lost his bid for lieutenant governor on Tuesday, acknowledged that Democrats have to find a way to re-energize their base after a bitter loss. \u201cI\u2019m not going to downplay now that we lost,\u201d Mitchell said. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt this did have national ramifications, but it shows we\u2019ve got an uphill battle. But this is not over by any means.\u201d Walker\u2019s win bolsters tea party, weakens Democrats A victory for curbs on public worker unions Recalling a governor is rare \u2013 trying to, not so much",

In 2008, after a bruising primary battle with Hillary Clinton, then-Sen. Barack Obama was on the outs with former President Bill Clinton. This election cycle, Clinton is one of Obama\u2019s most visible surrogates. Obama and Clinton were to appear together Monday night at three New York City fundraisers, which are expected to bring in millions of dollars. In April, the two appeared side by side at the home of longtime Clinton supporter and former Democratic National Committee Chairman Terry McAuliffe, raising $2.1 million for the Obama campaign and the DNC. Clinton and Obama hit up the Big Apple The Obama campaign is relying heavily on Clinton, tapping into his network of wealthy donors and featuring him in campaign ads.  Clinton is also expected to hit the trail to rally voters leading up to the November election. Clinton calls Romney's career 'sterling' Clinton reflects on Bain and Romney \u201cClinton just wants to help,\u201d a source close to the former president said.  \u201cHis message is \u2018I know what it takes on the economy, and Obama is doing the right thing.\u2019 They\u2019re not going to make the mistake of the Gore campaign.  They\u2019re not going to put [Clinton] on ice.\u201d Obama\u2019s relationship with the Clintons has had its ups and downs.  In 2007, the former president took aim at the then-junior senator from Illinois as inexperienced. \u201cYou know, I\u2019m old-fashioned. I think it really \u2013 I think a president ought to have done something for other people and for his country when you pick a president,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cI mean when is the last time we elected a president based on one year of service in the Senate before he started running?\u201d In early 2008, when Obama won the first-in-the-nation Iowa caucuses and emerged as a real contender, he entered into an all-out feud with the former first couple. The tussle was on full display during a January 2008 debate. \u201cI\u2019m here, not my husband,\u201d Hillary Clinton said to Obama. \u201cI can\u2019t tell who I\u2019m running against sometimes,\u201d Obama retorted. The Clinton source says, \u201cHe held a grudge, she didn\u2019t.\u201d Obama picking Hillary Clinton as his secretary of state helped heal some wounds.  And he\u2019s looked to Bill Clinton for help since taking office, hosting him at the White House during contentious negotiations with Congress in December 2010. \u201cI have a general rule, which is that whatever he asked me about my advice, and whatever I say, should become public only if he decides to make it public,\u201d Clinton told reporters then. As Obama struggles to appeal to white, working-class males, he hopes Clinton can woo those voters in key Southern and Rust Belt states. You wouldn\u2019t call the two men best of friends, but the lines of communication between the White House and the Clinton circle are open, sources in both camps say. But even as the two are now on the same team, they\u2019re not always reading from the same playbook. While the Obama campaign tries to make a liability of presumptive Republican nominee Mitt Romney\u2019s past as the head of a private equity firm, Clinton recently punched a hole in what has been a central campaign argument. \u201cI think he had a good business career,\u201d Clinton said of Romney last week on CNN\u2019s \u201cPiers Morgan Tonight.\u201d  \u201cThere\u2019s no question that in terms of getting up and going to the office and, you know, basically performing the essential functions of the office, the man who has been governor and had a sterling business career crosses the qualification threshold.\u201d Romney smiles at Clinton compliment Clinton later clarified his remarks, but the damage was done.

            "article_content": "NEW: Romney accuses President Obama of cronyism in the failure of Solyndra GOP protesters try to drown out a pro-Obama event in Boston Democrats attack Mitt Romney's record as Massachusetts governor Republicans continue their assault on Obama's economic policies A raucous news conference Thursday in Mitt Romney\u2019s home state of Massachusetts, with pro-Romney demonstrators trying to shout down campaigners for President Barack Obama criticizing the former governor, escalated the November election campaign more than five months before the voting. Romney, meanwhile, traveled to a shuttered solar panel maker Thursday to focus attention on what he called a symbol of the Obama administration\u2019s failed economic policies, as well as cronyism. \u201cThe president took a half a billion dollars of taxpayer money and devoted it to an enterprise that was owned in large measure by his campaign contributors,\u201d Romney said of Solyndra, the California solar panel maker that went bankrupt in 2011. \u201cThis is serious conflict of interest.\u201d Obama strategist heckled in Boston Congressional investigators looking into the Solyndra case have yet to find evidence of the kind of corruption implied by Romney, the certain Republican nominee for president. However, the loan guarantee of more than $500 million under a Department of Energy program to the company headed by an Obama contributor has become a favorite target for Republican attacks. Across the country, the Boston news conference by Democrats opened a new front in the Obama campaign strategy by taking on Romney\u2019s gubernatorial experience after previously targeting the multimillionaire businessman\u2019s background as head of a private equity company. A crowd of about 30 mostly young, white protesters waved signs declaring \u201cObama isn\u2019t working\u201d and chanted Romney\u2019s first name as well as \u201cwe want Mitt\u201d and \u201cbroken record\u201d as top Obama campaign strategist David Axelrod and several Massachusetts politicians spoke in front of the Massachusetts State House. Raising their voices over the din, the speakers criticized Romney\u2019s record during his four years as governor and referred repeatedly to the demonstrators seeking to drown out their message. \u201cYou can\u2019t handle the truth, my friends,\u201d Axelrod said to the protesters. \u201cThat\u2019s the problem. If you could handle the truth, you\u2019d quiet down.\u201d At one point, Axelrod noted that polling shows Romney trails well behind Obama in Massachusetts, calling that an indictment of Romney\u2019s record as governor. \u201cThese may be the only voters, right here, for Mitt Romney in Massachusetts,\u201d Axelrod said, gesturing to the demonstrators. \u201cIt\u2019s a harsh judgment from people who know him best.\u201d Axelrod also said Romney\u2019s business background at Bain Capital failed to prepare him for government leadership, and his experience in the governor\u2019s office for one term showed Romney failed to deliver on promised economic development. \u201cHe was a drive-by governor here on his way to running for president of the United States,\u201d Axelrod said, later adding that Romney \u201cplayed a shell game in order to say that he was making progress, and then he left a mess on the doorstep of the next governor.\u201d Axelrod repeated a consistent theme of the Obama campaign \u2013 that Romney\u2019 s motive in business was making the biggest private profit for himself and investors, rather than working for the overall public good. Citing what he and other speakers called problems from Romney\u2019s term as governor, including lagging employment and increased debt, Axelrod said making profits was \u201cfine, but it\u2019s not a prescription for leadership, as we saw in Massachusetts.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s what happens when you try to transfer those values and those principles into the governance of a state or country,\u201d Axelrod said. Before the Democratic event, state Republicans held their own news conference in the same spot, cheered by the demonstrators, who arrived by bus. Dan Winslow, a Republican state representative, said that under Romney, Massachusetts \u201ccreated more net new jobs in the state than President Obama has created in the last four years in the United States.\u201d Massachusetts House Minority Leader Brad Jones said Obama lacked a successful record as president, so his campaign was focused on attacking Romney. \u201cIf he had respectable job growth, he\u2019d be running on his own record instead of criticizing others,\u201d Jones said. In California, Romney\u2019s visit to the Solyndra building outside San Francisco was cloaked in secrecy, with the destination unannounced until shortly before the candidate and reporters arrived at the site. A Romney adviser said the campaign had concealed the event location for fear the Obama administration would somehow prevent them from staging it. Romney told reporters his campaign had wanted to head off any efforts by his rivals to keep him from speaking. \u201cThis building, this half a billion-dollar taxpayer investment, represents a serious conflict of interest on the part of the president and his team,\u201d Romney said. \u201cIt\u2019s also a symbol of how the president thinks about free enterprise. Free enterprise to the president means taking money from the taxpayers and giving it freely to his friends.\u201d Obama administration officials have called the failed Solyndra loan a disappointing result in their ongoing support of innovative technology. They vow to continue investing in clean energy. \u201cOver the course of this first term, we will have doubled the use of renewable energy in this country,\u201d Axelrod said Thursday in an interview to air on CNN\u2019s \u201cJohn King, USA.\u201d He added Romney was simply using the Solyndra stop as a \u201cdiversion\u201d from recent attacks against Romney\u2019s corporate career in private equity \u201cOne thing the president never did was buy a company, load it up with debt, bankrupt that company, and walk away with millions of dollars while the creditors and the workers were left holding an empty bag,\u201d Axelrod said, referring to Romney\u2019s former firm, Bain Capital. Meanwhile, the Republican National Committee released a video Thursday that uses Solyndra to bolster its message that Obama is a bad job creator. RNC Chairman Reince Priebus said Solyndra exemplifies the president\u2019s job creation record. \u201cI guess we can\u2019t be surprised with the economic results we have received over the past three years. Barack Obama has never run a business. He\u2019s never met a payroll and hasn\u2019t created a single job. The only thing he\u2019s ever managed is his personal narrative,\u201d he said in a written statement. \u201cAmerica needs Mitt Romney in the White House because he\u2019s spent time in both the private and public sector and understands how to get Americans back to work.\u201d A survey released Thursday indicated that Romney and Obama are statistically tied in three of the general election battleground states that Obama won in 2008. The NBC News/Marist poll showed a neck-and-neck race in Colorado, Iowa and Nevada, where voters said the economy was by far their top issue heading toward Election Day. Romney\u2019s record as governor also came under scrutiny in a video released Thursday by the Obama campaign that features Democratic officials from Massachusetts. In the video, mayors and state legislators compare Romney\u2019s campaign promises to results, slamming Romney for not developing solutions to an outflow of manufacturing positions. \u201cWe knew that we were losing manufacturing jobs, and he never found any solutions to try and figure out how we were going to keep them,\u201d Jeffrey Sanchez, a state representative, says in the video. \u201cBy the time Mitt Romney left office, we were 47th in the nation in terms of job growth.\u201d That statistic, cited frequently by Obama\u2019s campaign, is accurate, though the nonpartisan PolitiFact rates the full assertion as only \u201chalf true,\u201d noting that it\u2019s a stretch to entirely blame Romney (or any governor) for a state\u2019s jobs numbers. The video also includes claims by state Rep. Jay Kaufman that Romney hurt middle-class families by raising fees, rather than taxes. \u201cWhat we heard from Mitt Romney during the campaign was a \u2018no new taxes\u2019 pledge, but what he found very quickly during his term in office was that he couldn\u2019t deliver on any services without having sufficient resources, so he raised our taxes by raising our fees,\u201d Kaufman says in the video. Romney\u2019s record on taxes was similarly hit by fellow Republicans during the GOP primaries. A CNNMoney analysis of his record determined that he cut select taxes while in office, and proposed some new tax cuts that didn\u2019t pass the legislature \u2013 like a 0.3 percentage point reduction in the 5.3% state income tax rate. But he also had an obligation to balance the state\u2019s budget every year, and when he came into office, he was facing a big deficit that he plugged using a mix of spending cuts and revenue increases, including the fee increases. Carl Sciortino, another state legislator featured in the Obama video, said those fees hurt working families, who \u201cwere paying more under his administration.\u201d Sciortino says in the video that Romney\u2019s campaign promises reflect the GOP presidential candidate\u2019s current campaign. \u201cThere are times when I watch Mitt Romney saying the exact same things now that he said here in Massachusetts in 2002 in a robotic way that is completely hollow,\u201d Sciortino says. \u201cIt didn\u2019t work here, so I\u2019m not sure why he thinks it would work nationally.\u201d CNN\u2019s Kevin Liptak and Gabriella Schwarz contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Eastern Ohio wasn't a friendly region for Obama in 2008 Beck:  Biden can connect with voters there, he's an old-school Democrat Hillary Clinton took eastern and southeast Ohio in the 2008 primary Biden hails from Scranton, Pennsylvania, which has also seen hard times Vice President Joe Biden kicks off a two-day swing Wednesday through the eastern edge of the must-win battleground state of Ohio, an area that President Barack Obama is unlikely to visit this election year. And while the vice president apologized to the president last week for seemingly jumping the gun on the issue of same-sex marriage, this trip is an illustration of just how valuable Biden is for Obama as he bids for a second term in the White House. \u201cAs much as political insiders joke about Joe Biden, he\u2019s indispensable to the Obama ticket,\u201d says Republican strategist and CNN contributor Alex Castellanos. According to the Obama re-election campaign, the vice president will travel to Ohio\u2019s Mahoning and Ohio valleys \u201cto highlight the impact of President Obama\u2019s efforts to strengthen the region\u2019s manufacturing and auto industries, as well as bolster middle-class security for Ohio\u2019s workers.\u201d The campaign says Biden will speak at an advanced manufacturing facility in Youngstown and at a Chevrolet dealership in Martins Ferry. Obama's evolving same-sex beliefs Obama: Gay marriage 'should be legal' The general manger of the dealership, Joe Staffilino II, says he\u2019s \u201creally surprised\u201d that the vice president is dropping by and that people in the area \u201care real excited about the visit.\u201d It\u2019s not an area friendly to Obama, said Paul Beck, professor of political science at The Ohio State University. \u201cThese are areas of traditional Democratic strength, steel working areas, areas with a lot of working class Democrats from the old days. President Obama has not played well there,\u201d Beck explained. Obama was soundly defeated by then-Sen. Hillary Clinton in southeast and eastern Ohio in the Democratic presidential primary in March 2008, and while he won the state by five points over Sen. John McCain in the general election that November, he didn\u2019t perform as well in the eastern edge of the state. \u201cPart of the problem is that these tend to be more conservative Democrats. For some of them his race may be an issue, probably not among the younger ones but among some of the older voters. These tend to be depressed areas, with a lot of job loss over the past couple of decades. There are deeply entrenched pockets of unemployment and economic distress,\u201d Beck added. Biden grew up in Scranton, in neighboring Pennsylvania, an area that\u2019s also witnessed tough times in the past few decades. \u201cThese are places where I think Joe Biden has particular appeal, as a kind of traditional Democrat of the old school. He  comes from a part of Pennsylvania that\u2019s very much like the eastern part of Ohio. I think he can really connect with voters there in a way which President Obama cannot,\u201d Beck said. The president\u2019s been to Ohio 21 times since taking office. But only two of those trips took him through the state\u2019s eastern edge. But it\u2019s not just Obama \u2013 presumptive Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney was edged out by former Sen. Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania in much of the region in the March GOP primary. Santorum gave his primary night speech in the Ohio River valley city of Steubenville. Beck predicted that Romney will likely not \u201cbe able to connect with (eastern Ohio voters) well either\u201d ahead of the November election. Which is why Biden may come in so handy in blue-collar areas in eastern Ohio, western and central Pennsylvania, and in parts of Michigan. \u201cHis working-class honesty cuts through all the political bull in Washington. He grounds Obama in the real world. In blue-collar swing states like Ohio, Pennsylvania, and Michigan, Joe Biden is a tremendous asset to Obama who, at times, makes voters feel like he is president of the elite, for the elite, and by the elite,\u201d added Castellanos, who was a top media adviser for Romney\u2019s 2008 nomination bid, but who stayed neutral in this year\u2019s battle for the GOP nomination. Democratic strategist and CNN contributor Paul Begala agrees. \u201cUnlike Mitt Romney, Joe Biden can talk to middle-class people without an interpreter. Even though he\u2019s traveled the globe and is one of the most powerful people in the world, he\u2019s still Joe \u2013 a middle-class guy from Scranton. \u201cBiden\u2019s ability to connect with working families is one of the Obama campaign\u2019s greatest assets. I bet they\u2019ll be seeing a lot of him in the next six months,\u201d said Begala, who was a top adviser in the Clinton White House and who now is a senior adviser to Priorities USA, the pro-Obama super PAC. But some Republicans disagree about Biden\u2019s value to the Democratic ticket. \u201cIt speaks to President Obama\u2019s vulnerability that the campaign has to rely on Vice President Biden to campaign in key states like Ohio because Obama can\u2019t identify with voters. Between his infamous gaffes and his liberal positions on the free market and our nation\u2019s debt, having Biden on the stump carries its own set of risks,\u201d Republican National Committee press secretary Kirsten Kukowski told CNN. Biden\u2019s been in the spotlight recently for his comments a week and a half ago on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d that he was \u201cabsolutely comfortable\u201d with legal same-sex marriages, a position that the president had yet to take. Obama was forced to speed up his timetable on the issue and come out with his own comments approving the unions three days later. Some political pundits said that Biden was a liability to the president, while others pointed to the argument that running mates rarely matter in the race for the White House. \u201cSure, people vote for the top of the ticket, but this election will likely turn on who can build an economy for the middle class,\u201d Begala said.  \u201cIf that\u2019s the question, Biden is a big part of the answer.\u201d \u201cIf I were Biden, I would keep Obama on my ticket,\u201d Castellanos said.

            "article_content": "NEW: Sen. Carl Levin says hot topic issues to be discussed at NATO summit Car bomb in Kabul kills at least 7 people, wounds 17 after the visit Two American service members killed, two others injured in Wardak province blast Obama and Afghan President Hamid Karzai sign an agreement on future cooperation President Barack Obama marked the first anniversary of the death of terror mastermind Osama bin Laden with an unannounced visit to Afghanistan, signing a long-awaited strategic partnership agreement meant to set the conditions of an American withdrawal from the war-torn nation. The president reiterated that U.S. forces will not remain \u201ca single day longer\u201d than necessary, that he remains committed to pulling 23,000 troops out of the country by September and that he will stick to a 2014 deadline to fully withdraw from Afghanistan. \u201cWe will not build permanent bases in this country, nor will we be patrolling its cities and mountains,\u201d the president said during a nationally televised speech to the U.S. people from Bagram Air Base early on Wednesday (Tuesday evening in the United States). \u201cThat will be the job of the Afghan people.\u201d An undetermined number of U.S. forces will remain in country past 2014 working as military advisers and counterterrorism forces, but officials have yet to decide for how long. The trip comes as Obama\u2019s election campaign gears up and just weeks ahead of a NATO summit in Chicago, where the details of the transition and future commitments to the region are expected to be discussed. Obama tells the troops 'thank you' Obama: Afghan partnership looks to peace Obama's surprise visit to Afghanistan Romney reflects on bin Laden's death Speaking to reporters from Turkey after the trip to Afghanistan, Senate Armed Services Committee Chairman Carl Levin, D-Michigan, and member Jack Reed, D-Rhode Island, pointed to a series of lightening-rod issues expected to be addressed at the summit. They include hot topics such as Taliban and Haqqani safe havens in Pakistan, Afghan economic dependency on international spending and the grittier details of senior leadership positions within the nation\u2019s armed forces. \u201cOne thing we\u2019re going to see if there can be an early retirement of the officer corps to make room for the younger class (of Pashtuns from the country\u2019s restive southern and eastern provinces),\u201d said Levin, noting those groups are underrepresented. \u201cThat\u2019s something that\u2019s going to be discussed in Chicago, a retirement incentive,\u201d he said, a subtle nod to lingering questions over the army\u2019s current legitimacy in traditional Taliban strongholds. Going back to the Vietnam War era, American television networks have covered presidents speaking to military personnel or alongside foreign leaders overseas. But Obama\u2019s speech was the first televised address to the nation delivered from a war zone on foreign soil, according to White House spokesman Josh Earnest. The president\u2019s trip was his third since taking office and comes amid heightened tensions between the Obama and Karzai governments after a string of incidents involving U.S. personnel. Among them include an American service member charged with killing of 16 Afghan civilians, Quran burnings at a U.S. military base and the release of photographs of Americans posing with the remains of dead militants. Read extensive excerpts of the speech Meanwhile, two U.S. service members were killed and two were wounded in an explosion targeting their vehicle in Wardak province, officials said. About two hours after Obama left the country, a powerful explosion rocked the capital. Authorities later reported that it was a suicide car bomb that detonated outside the gates of Green Village, a compound that houses contractors and aid workers. The attack left at least seven people and wounded 17 others, including schoolchildren, officials said. \u201cThis is another desperate attack by the Taliban,\u201d said NATO spokesman Gen. Carsten Jacobson. \u201cAnother attack by the insurgency that resulted in the deaths of innocent Afghan civilians, with most of that being children from a nearby school.\u201d Photos: Obama's surprise visit to Afghanistan The U.N. Assistance Mission in Afghanistan said that the \u201cindiscriminate and illegal attacks are unacceptable and that those responsible are fully accountable for the deaths and injuries of civilians.\u201d In an e-mail, the Taliban denied there were civilian casualties and said it planned the attack after word circulated that the American president was going to be in Afghanistan, marking the start of their so-called spring offensive. Obama also spoke of a \u201cnegotiated peace\u201d and said his administration has been in direct talks with the Taliban. In March, the Afghan Taliban suspended the development of a diplomatic office in Qatar designed to allow them to hold talks with the United States, following public anger over the killing of the 16 civilians. \u201cWe\u2019ve made it clear that they can be a part of this future if they break with al Qaeda, renounce violence and abide by Afghan laws,\u201d Obama said Wednesday. See reactions to Obama\u2019s surprise trip Addressing Afghan concerns that America will abandon the country once its troops leave, Obama noted, \u201cWith this agreement, I am confident that the Afghan people will understand that the United States will stand by them.\u201d He later added that the U.S. \u201cdid not come here to claim resources or to claim territory. We came here with a very clear mission to destroy al Qaeda.\u201d Karzai offered his thanks to the American people for helping Afghanistan, and the presidents shook hands after signing the Strategic Partnership Agreement in the atrium of the King\u2019s Residence, part of the Presidential Palace in Kabul. \u201cThis agreement will close the season of the past 10 years and is going to open an equal relationship season,\u201d Karzai added. \u201cWith the signing of this agreement, we are starting a phase between two sovereign and independent countries that will be based on mutual respect, mutual commitments and mutual friendship.\u201d The security risks in Afghanistan seemed particularly pronounced given the secretive nature and timing of the trip. Obama landed in Afghanistan in the cover of darkness, and the signing ceremony occurred in the early morning hours. Presumptive GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney said, \u201cI am pleased that President Obama has returned to Afghanistan.\u201d \u201cOur troops and the American people deserve to hear from our president about what is at stake in this war,\u201d he said. \u201cSuccess in Afghanistan is vital to our nation\u2019s security.\u201d More than 130,000 troops from 50 countries serve in Afghanistan. The United States is the largest contributor, providing some 90,000 troops, followed by the United Kingdom (9,500), Germany (4,800) and France (3,600). But war that began with widespread approval in 2001 is now increasingly unpopular in Europe and the United States. The latest CNN/ORC International poll in late March show 55% of respondents would like to see the U.S. remove all its forces before 2014. More than 2,700 troops from the United States and its partners have died in the conflict. The majority of them American. Last week, Afghan National Security Adviser Rangin Daftar Spanta and U.S. Ambassador Ryan Crocker initialed the text that outlined the kind of relationship the two countries want in the decade following the NATO withdrawal. The deal had been long expected after Washington and Kabul found compromises over the thorny issues of \u201cnight raids\u201d by U.S. forces on Afghan homes and the transfer of U.S. detainees to Afghan custody. It seeks to create an enduring partnership that prevents the Taliban from waiting out a U.S. withdrawal to try to regain power, the senior administration officials have said.

            "article_content": "Conservative activist: \"[W]e moved to what I call Tea Party 2.0\" Many in the movement say they will focus intensely on flipping the Senate into GOP hands Tea Party Express kicks off bus tour through seven states with contested Senate races CNN analyst: Influence of tea party likely to be more diluted in 2012 than it was in 2010 While loud and raucous rallies are still a part of the tea party toolbox, the movement, which came to life over dissatisfaction with big government and anger over government bailouts and President Barack Obama\u2019s health care reform, is evolving. \u201cAfter the 2010 elections, what was interesting, we moved to what I call Tea Party 2.0,\u201d said Clyde Fabretti, a conservative activist affiliated with tea party groups in Florida such as the West Orlando Tea Party and the Central Florida Tea Party Council.  \u201c2.0 allows for \u2026 our ability to accomplish legislative initiatives, supporting various tea party candidates that adhere to the principles and values.  And we have been hugely active.\u201d \u201cBut it isn\u2019t the kind of activity that makes the press,\u201d Fabretti continued.  \u201cI mean, when you put 5,000 people at an event, you know, everybody shows up with their cameras.  You have 10 meetings with different legislators on [Capitol] Hill \u2013 nobody knows about it.\u201d With many activists still lukewarm to presumptive GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney, many in the movement say they will focus intensely on flipping the Senate into Republican hands. Rallying the troops is part of the movement\u2019s agenda. On Friday, the Tea Party Express kicked off its sixth national bus tour, weaving its way through Pennsylvania and Ohio then heading to  Indiana, Iowa, Nebraska, Missouri and Texas, all states with contested Senate races. But leaders in the movement described other tactics they\u2019re using \u2013 some long-tried, some new that are designed to train and mobilize tea party and conservative activists for political warfare. Tea party booster Americans for Prosperity spokesman Levi Russell said his group is supplying volunteers with suitcases stuffed with cell phones to set up mini phone banks in activists\u2019 homes. \u201cThis is a whole new thing that AFP has been putting in place and really hasn\u2019t really talked about too much,\u201d Russell said.  He said the group has purchased \u201ca few thousand\u201d phones. It\u2019s also arming volunteers \u201cwith tablets, like iPad-style,\u201d Russell said. \u201cThey\u2019re going door-to-door, knocking on doors.  They\u2019re making phone calls,\u201d the spokesman said. \u201cIt\u2019s not something that makes the press, it\u2019s not like a big rally event where there\u2019s a big visual.  But it\u2019s just meet-ups.  Sometimes its just five or six people, sometimes it\u2019s 50 people.\u201d In other cases, activists are holding conservative book clubs and movie circles to educate those of like minds. Florida-based Internet company Big Voices Media, for which Fabretti is a senior consultant, hopes to become a kind-of YouTube for conservatives, allowing them \u2013 and only conservatives \u2013 to post videos, create channels, stream programming and search for content of interest to fellow conservatives. Users can also establish their own channels. The content is accessible online, on mobile devices and via the popular Internet streaming device Roku to create \u201ca conservative broadcast network,\u201d Fabretti said. Fabretti also explained how Big Voices aims to have an impact in key Senate battles. \u201cWe enter those races by providing the tea party groups and the policy groups in those geographic areas the ability to broadcast the information that they are interested in broadcasting to the public,\u201d he said. When pressed for metrics on how far and wide the service reaches, Fabretti said it is undergoing a change in its business plan \u2013 from subscription-based to a free service \u2013 and said he could not offer specifics. Meet-ups at FreedomWorks\u2019 \u201cboot camps\u201d are decidedly more intense. The Washington-based tea party support group holds training sessions across the country to train activists in modern-day outreach. Brendan Steinhauser, the group\u2019s director of federal and state campaigns, described an upcoming \u201cboot camp\u201d in Washington. \u201cSunday is activism training,\u201d Steinhauser said.  \u201cHow to write a letter to the editor, how to go to a town hall meeting, how to call your congressman, how to organize your group, how to raise money for your group, how to get media attention, how to use Facebook and Twitter and Freedom Connector, and that sort of stuff.  How to build a relationship with media.  And then also how to campaign, how to get out the vote.\u201d \u201cSo it\u2019s a pretty intense day.\u201d Steinhauser added: \u201cWe did 105 boot camps in 2011\u2026 and those are mostly in key Senate states or key swing states.  So Florida, Ohio, Virginia, Pennsylvania, we did a lot in Indiana because of the primary and North Carolina because of the presidential election.\u201d Rallies are still valuable for getting attention, but they also provide recruits who want to be more involved. \u201cSay you have 5,000 people show up [at a rally.]  But you take 500 of those who actually want to do a lot more work and you train them. And then you take the 50 that are really the leaders of that group, and give them the most intense one-on-one training and mentoring,\u201d Steinhauser said.  \u201cYou really can do force multiplication where, now these folks are doing a lot more \u2013 more efficiently, more effectively on their own. \u201cIt\u2019s like the military, sort of leadership training,\u201d Steinhauser added.  \u201cThe soldier on the ground with the M-16 is superimportant and you need a lot of them and they need to be out there, well trained.  But you also have sort of a separate training for leadership, for the officers.\u201d Tea Party Patriots, the movement\u2019s largest group, has a citizen journalist program \u201cwhere we\u2019re recruiting and have citizen journalists who are keeping track of what different congressmen are doing,\u201d National Coordinator Jenny Beth Martin said. More than 100 journalists have been recruited, but, \u201cWe\u2019re working to fill it up so we\u2019ve got at least one for every congressman and senator,\u201d Martin said. Shelby Blakely, national support team journalists coordinator, explained that volunteers are asked to \u201creport\u201d on their assigned lawmaker in at least two articles per month, posted to the group\u2019s website. \u201cJust the act of knowing [lawmakers] have someone watching them changes the dynamic,\u201d Blakely said. Will these efforts matter? Democrats and liberal allies have long employed similar tactics in the field of campaigning: recruiting armies of volunteers to knock on doors and distribute information. Many of their supporters have prominent YouTube channels and many Democratic campaigns, including President Obama\u2019s, are seen as having vast advantages in field organizing and on social media. As for the tea party\u2019s focus on Senate races, a spokesman for the group tasked with electing Democrats to that chamber said he welcomed the tea party\u2019s activities. \u201cI enthusiastically welcome their efforts,\u201d the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee\u2019s Matt Canter said.  \u201cI mean, the tea party did more than anybody or any thing to prevent Republicans from taking the majority in 2010.  And so far they have caused  divisive primaries across the country that are hurting Republican chances in nearly a dozen states.\u201d Canter continued: \u201cThey are having a major impact on the Republican agenda, nationally, and moving the party further and further to the far right \u2013 and further away from the middle class that\u2019s going to decide the election.  So more power to them.\u201d CNN Senior Political Analyst Ron Brownstein said despite the efforts, the movement may come up short. \u201cThe tea party is basically a mobilization of existing constituencies within the kind of the Republican coalition.  And its impact was enormous in 2010 in part because we were dealing with a smaller electorate,\u201d Brownstein said. \u201cThe challenge for the tea party in 2012 is a bigger electorate with more casual voters who tend to be younger and more minority \u2013 its influence is inevitably going to be diluted from what it was in 2010.\u201d Brownstein, editorial director of National Journal, also pointed to another challenge. \u201cThe other problem they\u2019ve got is that, in 2010, they were able to generate enormous energy in a backlash against what Obama was doing,\u201d he said.  \u201cBut the kind of a solution they favored clearly doesn\u2019t have majority public support either.  And their ratings have gone down.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Obama's poll standing is closely tied to economic performance U.S. election outcome could depend on changes in Europe's economy Europe's economy could be at a tipping point this year Labeling Romney a right winger may not work if the global economy implodes President Obama\u2019s opponents like nothing more than tying him to a socialist Europe, the bogeyman of today\u2019s American right. Whatever the merits of their claims policy-wise, they might be onto something from a campaign perspective. As it turns out, the fate of Obama\u2019s re-election bid could hinge more on what happens in France or Spain than Ohio over the next six months.  Europe\u2019s economic woes could push America\u2019s soft recovery into reverse, and Mitt Romney into the White House. The first three months of 2012 couldn\u2019t have been better for the president.  Romney was pushed to the right by disenchanted Republican primary voters while the U.S. economy gathered steam.  Roughly 600,000 jobs were created, unemployment edged down by 0.3% and the Dow jumped more than 8%.  The broader S&P 500 rose by a whopping 12%. U.K. in recession for 2nd time since 2008 Improving economic conditions were reflected in the polls.  The number of registered voters who said the economy is in good shape rose by 13% between January and March, according to the CNN/ORC International Poll.  The late March survey showed Obama beating Romney by 11 percentage points among registered voters.  An average of several notable polls conducted around the same time showed a slightly tighter race, with Obama up 6%. Olympics help with London's unemployed Netherlands feels eurozone crisis pinch France heads to presidential runoff Hollande claims victory in France Fast forward a couple of weeks.  An April 13-15 CNN/ORC International Poll showed Obama\u2019s edge over Romney dropping to 9 points.  You can chalk that up to the sampling error, but CNN\u2019s most recent \u201cpoll of polls\u201d showed Obama\u2019s advantage dropping to 3 points. What happened? First, according to several analysts, there was a natural post-primary tightening of the race as disenchanted conservatives began to fall into line behind Romney.  Arch-conservatives will never love the former Massachusetts governor, but intense Obama hatred is expected to bring them out in November. Romney\u2019s \u201cpositions are perfectly fine with the base,\u201d argues veteran GOP strategist Charlie Black, who is now offering counsel to Romney. \u201cThe organized conservative movement just needs to have some communication and encouragement to come on board.\u201d Second, the economy stumbled.  There was a jump in unemployment claims, and each of the market indexes logged their biggest weekly declines of the year.  A revision in monthly employment data showed employers adding only 120,000 jobs in March \u2013 badly missing expectations.  There was a poor housing starts report, and prices at the pump remained stubbornly high. The economy remains the dominant issue this year, and voters are now split on which candidate is better able to help spur a stronger recovery: 44% of voters say Obama is more likely to get the economy moving, while 42% choose Romney, according to the April CNN/ORC survey.  This naturally translates to a tight horse race. This is also where Obama finds himself at Europe\u2019s mercy.  The U.S. economy is currently on autopilot.  A sharply polarized Congress and a tapped out Federal Reserve can\u2019t do much more to stimulate the economy this year.  European policymakers, however, could take a number of steps felt in the United States, not all of them positive from Obama\u2019s perspective. The rise of Europe\u2019s far-right? Depending on your point of view, harsh austerity measures or debt-driven market jitters are suffocating one of America\u2019s most critical economic partners.  Unemployment in the eurozone is north of 10%, and many economists expect it to climb higher this year. While the problems of smaller countries like Greece are well known to the average American voter, economies of larger countries like Italy are also struggling.  New questions are now being raised about France, where leading Socialist presidential candidate Fran\u00e7ois Hollande is campaigning on a higher spending agenda completely at odds with German Chancellor Angela Merkel\u2019s debt-driven priorities. The kicker may prove to be Spain, which is reeling from an unfathomable 24% unemployment rate and one of the world\u2019s worst housing busts.  Robert Samuelson notes in Monday\u2019s Washington Post that \u201cif Spain\u2019s crisis deepens Europe\u2019s recession, it could tip the entire world economy into a stubborn slump.\u201d  He also notes the negative impact such a downturn could have on Obama\u2019s re-election chances. If Europe \u2013 one-fifth of the global economy \u2013 goes down, America goes down with it.  And so could Obama.  Romney \u2013 known for business turnarounds \u2013 is well positioned to appeal to the same affluent suburban white voters who flocked to Obama when the economy imploded in 2008.  Tack those voters on to an angry conservative base and an alienated white working class, and you have a recipe for a Romney win. Zakaria: Too much austerity in Europe Obama\u2019s team has switched strategies now, labeling Romney a hard core right winger instead of a flip flopper extraordinaire.  But it\u2019s questionable at best whether that strategy will work against the backdrop of a severely stumbling economy.  Faced with a lousy economy in 1980, Jimmy Carter tried to pin the \u201ccrazy right winger\u201d tag on Ronald Reagan.  Carter ended up with 49 electoral votes. Tune out all the noise about \u201cmommy wars\u201d and the gender gap.  Watch the economy and, more specifically, watch Europe.  That may tell you all you need to know about election night in November. CNN\u2019s Peter Hamby contributed to this report",

            "article_content": "John Edwards' criminal trial begins Monday Edwards was indicted on six charges and could face up to 30 years in prison At issue: Did Edwards \"knowingly, willfully\" use illegal contributions to hide mistress? Trial caps off Edwards fall from potential presidential candidate to potential prisoner On any given day in the fall of 2007, John Edwards could be heard preaching his populist prose to Iowa voters who eagerly packed into lumber barns, VFW halls and Culver restaurants across the state. His message was less about the two Americas of his 2004 campaign \u2013 the haves and the have-nots \u2013 and more about fighting for the middle class and ending poverty in America. The Democratic candidate had spent nearly all of 2007 logging days in Iowa traveling across the state\u2019s 99 counties. He had every reason to believe he could be president. He felt the country would let then-Sens. Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama destroy each other and he would rise as the more experienced and safe nominee. To many voters, Edwards could have been president of the United States. Five years later, the possibilities for Edwards are completely different. Edwards\u2019 criminal trial begins Monday in Greensboro, North Carolina. He is charged with six felony and misdemeanor counts related to the money dealings of his failed presidential campaign. Among other things, the government alleges that Edwards \u201cknowingly and willfully\u201d received nearly $1 million in illegal campaign contributions to hide his pregnant mistress from the public so he could continue his presidential bid. Edwards acknowledges that while his actions were wrong, they were not illegal. He could face up to 30 years in prison. Edwards met Rielle Hunter in early 2006 at bar at The Regency Hotel in New York City. Hunter approached Edwards, not believing it was him. Later that evening, Edwards and Hunter met again, privately. The man who consistently spoke about two Americas began living two lives. Hunter describes herself as a filmmaker. Born Lisa Jo Druck, she is believed to be the inspiration of a party girl character in a Jay McInerny novel. The 40-something Rielle told Edwards that she could help his campaign. Edwards hired her to produce a few videos that would present the politician in a more relaxed manner. The videos were called \u201cwebisodes\u201d and were posted to Edwards\u2019 campaign site. In the first webisode, Edwards told Hunter on camera, \u201cYou train to be careful, to close off if it feels sensitive, to close off if it feels personal, and I have to tell myself, I\u2019m trying hard to do it. But you know we\u2019re so conditioned. We\u2019re conditioned to say the same things \u2026 we\u2019re conditioned to be political. And it\u2019s hard to shed all of that. I can be in the middle of being what feels real and authentic to me, and I\u2019ll get into a little reel, you know, in my head. I can see it happening, and I have to pull myself back out.\u201d You train to be careful, to close off if it feels sensitive, to close off if it feels personal, and I have to tell myself, I\u2019m trying hard to do it. But you know we\u2019re so conditioned. John Edwards The clip resurfaced later on YouTube. In the end, four webisodes were made. However, instead of showing Edwards in a new light, the flirtatious on-camera banter only highlighted just how close Edwards and Hunter had become. Staffers began to suspect that Hunter had become more than a videographer to Edwards. That thought was fueled by Edwards\u2019 insistence that Hunter be allowed to travel with him whenever either of them insisted. Josh Brumberger was Edwards\u2019 chief of staff when Hunter traveled with the campaign. On several occasions, he talked to Edwards about Hunter\u2019s involvement with the campaign. One heated altercation ended with Edwards firing Brumberger, and by the fall of 2006, several longtime senior aides left the campaign amid Edwards\u2019 refusal to end his relationship with Hunter, as detailed in \u201cGame Change,\u201d the book about the 2008 election. On December 28, 2006, against the backdrop of a city trying to rebuild and revive itself, Edwards launched his presidential campaign in New Orleans. He vowed to strengthen the middle class, progressively end poverty and tackle the longstanding Democratic platform of health care. But just as the campaign got off the ground, it hit turbulence. In March 2007, Elizabeth Edwards announced she had breast cancer for the second time and it was incurable. The Edwardses wound up continuing the campaign. In the weeks after the devastating discovery, internal campaign polling showed Edwards surging ahead of Clinton and Obama in Iowa. Meanwhile, when the campaign klieg lights were off, Edwards and Hunter were still on. Over the course of the summer, Hunter had become pregnant. And to complicate things, Edwards was swimming in a pool of bad press \u2013 he had received several $400 haircuts and had made a six-figure salary for working for a hedge fund that was linked to subprime lending and foreclosed homes. Enter Rachel \u201cBunny\u201d Mellon. The wealthy banking heiress and widow, who was once a close friend of Jacqueline Kennedy, had been a supporter of Edwards since the 2004 election. When she found out about the haircuts, she allegedly directed Andrew Young, Edwards\u2019 personal aide, to forward all bills to her. In a note to Edwards received by Young, a person described in the indictment as Person C and believed to be Mellon wrote, \u201cThe timing of your telephone call on Friday was \u2018witchy.\u2019 I was sitting alone in a grim mood \u2013 furious that the press attacked Senator Edwards on the price of a haircut. But it inspired me \u2013 from now on, all haircuts, etc., that are necessary and important for his campaign \u2013 please send the bills to me \u2013 it\u2019s a way to help our friend without government restrictions.\u201d \u2026from now on, all haircuts, etc., that are necessary and important for his campaign - please send the bills to me. \"Person C\" in indictment against Edwards After already contributing to Edwards the maximum amount under law, Mellon provided additional money to Edwards. According to court documents, between June 2007 and January 2008, Mellon allegedly wrote personal checks payable to a friend, hiding that she was giving money to Edwards. To throw people off, Mellon is accused of falsely listing items of furniture on memo lines of checks such as \u201cchairs,\u201d \u201cantique Charleston table\u201d and \u201cbook case.\u201d The checks were made out to Young\u2019s wife in her maiden name and were deposited into accounts controlled by her and Young. As Edwards and Young planned, Young allegedly used the money to provide Hunter with rent, furniture, care, living expense, medical visits and prenatal care. In total, the now 101-year-old Mellon gave Edwards seven checks ranging from $10,000 to $200,000 from June 2007 to January 2008. On October 10, 2007, the National Enquirer ran its first story saying Edwards was having an affair. The next day while campaigning in Summerton, South Carolina, Edwards denied the report and said it was \u201ctabloid trash.\u201d With tabloid reporters and photographers chasing Hunter and publishing photos of her pregnant, a second wealthy donor came forward. Fred Baron, a wealthy Texas lawyer who is now deceased, was the national finance chair of the campaign. Court documents show that from December 2007 to January 2008, Baron allegedly wrote nine checks ranging from $9,000 to $58,000. The money was used for Young to hide a pregnant Hunter from the media, as he falsely claimed paternity for her child. Baron\u2019s money was used to charter a private jet for trips to Fort Lauderdale, Florida; Aspen, Colorado; San Diego and Santa Barbara, California. Things weren\u2019t faring better for Edwards on the trail. He placed second in the Iowa caucuses and following disappointing losses in New Hampshire and South Carolina he ended his campaign for president on January 30, 2008. Reporters remained persistent, continuing to ask Edwards if he was having an affair as it was rumored in Democratic circles that he was secretly trying to broker a deal for vice president or attorney general if Clinton or Obama was elected. In February 2008, Hunter and Edwards\u2019 child was born. On August 8, 2008, after repeated denials, Edwards admitted he had an affair with Hunter in an interview with ABC\u2019s Bob Woodruff. During the interview, when asked if he was the father of Hunter\u2019s child, he responded, \u201cThat is absolutely not true.\u201d When asked if there was money paid to try to cover up his affair with Hunter, Edwards stated, \u201cI\u2019ve never paid a dime of money to any of the people that are involved. I never asked anybody to pay a dime of money, never been told that any money has been paid. Nothing has been done at my request. So if the allegation is that somehow I participated in the payment of money, that is a lie.\u201d While his name was not on the birth certificate, Edwards would eventually claim paternity and apologize for denying the baby was his child. Following the mea culpa, it seemed that Edwards\u2019 fall from grace had finally ended. But it got worse. In February 2009, the U.S. Department of Justice acknowledged they had opened an investigation on Edwards regarding campaign finances. By this point, his more than 30-year-old marriage was falling apart. John and Elizabeth separated and lived apart until Elizabeth Edwards succumbed to breast cancer. She died weeks before Christmas in 2010, with Edwards and their oldest daughter, Cate, at her bedside. Edwards was now a widower and the sole caregiver to his young children with Elizabeth \u2013 Emma Claire and Jack, then 12 and 10 \u2013 in addition to providing financial support for Quinn, his daughter with Hunter. For Edwards, life got worse. After testimony from a cast of former staffers, including Hunter, Mellon and Young, who had published a scandalous tell all-book, a grand jury indicted him on June 3, 2011. Edwards was indicted on six charges: one count of conspiracy, four counts of illegal campaign contributions and one count of making false statements. Each offense is punishable to up to five years in prison and fines, totaling up to 30 years in prison. At the heart of the government\u2019s case is campaign finance law, specifically whether Edwards violated the Election Act. Established in 1971, the Election Act states that to restrict the influence that any one person can have on the outcome of a primary election for president, the most any individual could contribute to any candidate for that primary election is $2,300. Prosecutors will argue that Edwards accepted and received contributions from Mellon and Baron in excess of the limits of the Election Act. Court documents detail that Edwards accepted about $725,000 from Mellon and more than $200,000 from Baron. These unlawful contributions were then used to pay for Hunter\u2019s living and medical expenses and to pay for travel and accommodations to keep Hunter from the news media. Additionally, prosecutors say Edwards concealed from the FEC and the public the contributions by filing false and misleading campaign finance reports. Court documents conclude, \u201cEdwards knew that public revelation of the affair and pregnancy would destroy his candidacy and undermine Edwards\u2019 presentation of himself as a family man and by forcing his campaign to divert personnel and resources away from other campaign activities to respond to the criticism and the media scrutiny regarding the affair.\u201d Edwards\u2019 defense is that the money he received from Mellon and Baron was for personal reasons, most importantly to protect his wife who was dying, and to protect his family. He contends that at no point throughout the ordeal did he ever think he was breaking the law. Experts say the government has an uphill battle. This type of case is considered unprecedented in the arena of campaign finance, as there are many loopholes in the law. After shuffling his legal team a few times, Edwards is represented by high profile attorney Abbe Lowell. Two additional lawyers from North Carolina will assist Lowell. The trial is proceeding because Edwards refused a plea bargain that would have given him a few months in prison but would have allowed him to keep his law license. U.S. District Court Attorney Catherine Eagles has selected 42 potential jurors. The first bit of business on Monday will be the final seating of 12 jurors and four alternates. After that, the trial will begin with opening arguments. It is expected to last anywhere from two to six weeks.",

            "article_content": "NEW: Daughter's illness was a major factor in the decision, a senior source says NEW: Santorum has agreed to a face-to-face meeting with Romney, the source says The former Pennsylvania senator says his campaign was waged \"against all odds\" Obama's campaign immediately targets Romney, who trails in a new poll Conservative challenger Rick Santorum announced Tuesday that he is suspending his Republican presidential campaign after a weekend of \u201cprayer and thought,\u201d effectively ceding the GOP nomination to front-runner Mitt Romney. Santorum made his announcement after the weekend hospitalization of his 3-year-old daughter Isabella, and in the face of tightening poll numbers in Pennsylvania \u2013 the state he represented as a U.S. senator \u2013 ahead of the April 24 primary. \u201cLadies and gentlemen, we made the decision to get into this race around our kitchen table, against all the odds,\u201d Santorum told a news conference, flanked by emotional family members. \u201cWe made a decision over the weekend that while the presidential race for us is over, and I will suspend my campaign effective today, we are not done fighting.\u201d The development means Romney, the former Massachusetts governor, is now the certain GOP nominee to take on President Barack Obama in November. While Romney still needs to win several hundred delegates to clinch the nomination, Santorum was his top remaining challenger, and Tuesday\u2019s announcement leaves Romney\u2019s path unhindered. Santorum and Romney spoke before the announcement, and Romney told supporters in Delaware that Santorum \u201cwill continue to have a major role in the Republican Party.\u201d \u201cWe exchanged our thoughts about going forward, and we both have a great deal of interest in seeing the country taken in a very different path,\u201d said Romney, who is making his second bid for the GOP nomination. He added, \u201cI look forward to his work in helping to assure victories for Republicans across the country in November.\u201d Gingrich: Santorum showed courage Media declare GOP race over Exploring possible running mates Are attacks on Romney's money fair? A senior Santorum source, speaking on condition of anonymity while discussing private conversations, said there is no question his daughter\u2019s hospitalization was a major factor in the decision to bow out. \u201cWhen you have enough time with your adrenaline down, you start to think about what\u2019s really important,\u201d the source told CNN. Sitting in the hospital with his daughter, who was born with a potentially fatal chromosomal disorder, for the second time during this campaign put that in perspective for Santorum, especially since the delegate math was not on his side, the source said. The final decision was made Monday night, while the candidate\u2019s family was on the phone with senior strategists John Brabender, longtime adviser Mark Rodgers, campaign manager Mike Biundo and just a few others, the source said. Sources said Romney asked for Santorum\u2019s endorsement right away during their phone conversation. But Santorum\u2019s communications director, Hogan Gidley, said there was no guarantee that would happen after what has been a tough and at times bitter campaign. The senior Santorum source said Romney requested a face-to-face meeting during their talk. Santorum agreed to have one soon, but the source said the time and place have not been set. In his remarks Tuesday, Santorum never mentioned Romney by name. Santorum could be a valuable ally for Romney by helping deliver the party\u2019s Republican base, which harbors some distrust of the conservative credentials of the former Massachusetts governor. However, Santorum has consistently said the party needed a true conservative candidate \u2013 himself \u2013 to defeat Obama, and he has relentlessly attacked Romney\u2019s support for health care reforms in Massachusetts that included a mandate for coverage similar to the 2010 federal health care law despised by conservatives. Romney\u2019s difficulty with conservatives was evident Tuesday, as two groups known for right-wing stances on social issues commended Santorum\u2019s campaign effort but made no mention of Romney. \u201cSen. Santorum is an able and worthy competitor, and I congratulate him on the campaign he ran,\u201d Romney said in a statement. \u201cHe has proven himself to be an important voice in our party and in the nation.  We both recognize that what is most important is putting the failures of the last three years behind us and setting America back on the path to prosperity.\u201d Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich, another GOP contender trailing well behind Romney and Santorum, also congratulated Santorum for a \u201cremarkable campaign\u201d that showed the appeal of conservative principles. Both Gingrich and the other challenger, Texas Rep. Ron Paul, said they intended to stay in the race to the Republican convention in August. \u201cI think it makes it clearer and simpler,\u201d Gingrich said of Santorum\u2019s decision while campaigning in North Carolina later Tuesday. \u201cThere is one conservative voice in the race and then there is a moderate, and I think [that] makes it easier to articulate and to focus on the platform issues I want to focus on.\u201d In a statement by his campaign, Gingrich said he \u201chumbly\u201d asked Santorum supporters to check out his conservative record on his website Newt.org. Shortly after Santorum\u2019s announcement, the Gingrich website appeared to have crashed, though the reason wasn\u2019t known. The Obama campaign immediately took aim at Romney, with campaign manager Jim Messina saying it was \u201cno surprise that Mitt Romney finally was able to grind down his opponents under an avalanche of negative ads.\u201d \u201cThe more the American people see of Mitt Romney, the less they like him and the less they trust him,\u201d Messina said in a statement. \u201cWhile calling himself the \u2018ideal candidate\u2019 for the tea party, he has promised to return to the same policies that created the economic crisis and has alienated women, middle class families, and Hispanic Americans.\u201d Santorum advisers including Gidley said the final decision to suspend the campaign, which allows him to continue raising money and probably keep control of delegates won so far, came Monday night and was based on three factors. Santorum needed the Texas primary on May 29, with 154 delegates at stake, to be winner-take-all instead of the proportional allocation system based on vote results now in place. However, a complex process for changing the allocation method made that unlikely, they said. In addition, Santorum needed Gingrich to step aside so Santorum could bring together the conservative right, but Gingrich stayed in the race, they said. Santorum also needed to win Pennsylvania, which remained possible but would require large amounts of time and money against an expected Romney offensive there, the advisers said. Santorum had canceled two events earlier Tuesday while adding an afternoon event that turned out to be his withdrawal announcement. Gidley said the two morning events were canceled to allow Santorum and his wife, Karen, to \u201csettle in at home\u201d with their young daughter, known as Bella. Bella was born with Trisomy 18, a serious chromosomal condition that interferes with development. Half of patients with the condition do not survive past the first week of life, according to the National Institutes of Health. Santorum mentioned the girl several times in his comments, saying he was inspired by people who cited the need to speak up for people with disabilities and others being marginalized by the nation\u2019s present direction and problems. Santorum: The 'race for us is over' Rick Santorum: In his own words \u201cAgainst all odds we won 11 states, millions of voters, millions of votes,\u201d Santorum said, adding he found a \u201cdeeper love for this country\u201d through the campaign. \u201cIt was a love affair for me going from state to state and seeing the differences but seeing the wonderful, wonderful  people of this country  who care deeply about where this country is going in the future, who care deeply about those who are out there paddling alone who are feeling left behind and in some respects are feeling hopeless and want to do something,\u201d he said. Meanwhile, a poll Tuesday shows Romney trailing Obama in a head-to-head matchup, though voters remain split on which presidential contender is best equipped to handle the economy. The survey, from Washington Post/ABC News, showed 51% of Americans would choose Obama if the election were held now, compared to 44% for Romney. According to the polling data, Americans are divided on which candidate would best handle economic issues: Forty-seven percent favored Romney while 43% named Obama. When asked which man would be better at creating jobs, 46% named Obama and 43% said Romney. Both margins were within the poll\u2019s 3.5 percentage point sampling error. Voters were less divided on other key issues. Fifty-three percent said Obama was best poised to handle international affairs, compared to 36% who said Romney. Conversely, when asked which man would do a better job of reducing the federal deficit, 51% said Romney and 38% said Obama. In terms of likability, Obama held a clear advantage, with 64% of Americans polled saying the president was a more friendly and likable person, a nearly 2-to-1 advantage over Romney, who was at 26%. The serious gender gap between the two candidates \u2013 also seen in recent Gallup and CNN/ORC polls \u2013 also appeared in the new poll. Obama had the support of 57% of women, compared to 38% who said they backed Romney, while the former Massachusetts governor had the backing of 52% of men, compared to 44% who backed Obama. Among another important voting block, independents, the poll shows a much tighter race, with 48% backing Romney compared to 46% for Obama, also within the survey\u2019s sampling error. Romney has used a huge advantage in money and organization to build his lead over Santorum, Gingrich and Paul. In particular, the Romney campaign and the super PAC supporting it have spent millions of dollars on negative ads in the run-up to major primary and caucus votes so far. Gingrich admitted Sunday that Romney was the likely nominee. \u201cI think you have to be realistic,\u201d Gingrich said on \u201cFox News Sunday.\u201d \u201cGiven the size of his organization, given the number of primaries he\u2019s won, he is far and away the most likely Republican nominee.\u201d CNN\u2019s latest estimate of the GOP delegate tally shows Romney with 659, Santorum with 275, Gingrich with 140 and Paul with 71. It takes 1,144 delegates to clinch the nomination. New York, Connecticut, Rhode Island and Delaware vote on April 24, in addition to Pennsylvania. In all, 231 delegates are up for grabs in the five states. The goal now for Gingrich and Paul is to prevent Romney from reaching the 1,144-delegate threshold before the convention. While all but conceding the GOP race, Gingrich said Sunday he won\u2019t give up on trying to influence the party\u2019s platform that emerges going into the general election. \u201cI think platforms matter in the long run in the evolution of the party,\u201d the former House speaker said. \u201cAnd the party is more than just a presidential candidate \u2013 it\u2019s Senate candidates, House candidates, state legislators.\u201d Gingrich also said he has already talked to Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus about working in the fall \u201cto help defeat Obama any way I could \u2013 whatever the team thinks I can do to be helpful, I would do.\u201d Beyond that, he said he wouldn\u2019t want to serve in a Romney administration and would rather \u201cgo back to a post-political career.\u201d CNN\u2019s Kevin Liptak, Dana Bash, John King, Peter Hamby, Shannon Travis and Steve Brusk contributed to this report.",

Santorum spokesman Hogan Gidley told CNN that the Santorum family expects Bella to be released from the hospital later Monday. \u201cWe appreciate the outpouring of support and prayers,\u201d Gidley told CNN. \u201cThe prayers worked, she\u2019s doing much better, so we\u2019re thankful for that. It puts things in perspective.\u201d Santorum and former House Speaker Newt Gingrich have resisted calls to end their races in the face of Romney\u2019s substantial lead in the delegate count. On Sunday, Gingrich admitted that Romney was the \u201clikely\u201d nominee. \u201cI think you have to be realistic,\u201d Gingrich said on \u201cFox News Sunday.\u201d \u201cGiven the size of his organization, given the number of primaries he\u2019s won, he is far and away the most likely Republican nominee.\u201d CNN\u2019s latest estimate shows the GOP delegate tally at Romney with 659, Santorum with 275, Gingrich with 140 and Rep. Ron Paul with 71; 1,144 delegates are needed to clinch the nomination. In addition to Pennsylvania, New York, Connecticut, Rhode Island and Delaware also vote on April 24. In all, 231 delegates are up for grabs in the five states. Asked last week if Santorum would win in his home state, Romney said, \u201cI think everybody expects someone to win their home state. Newt Gingrich won his state. I won my state. I think people expect the senator to win his home state. \u201cBut I hope to pick up a lot of delegates, and we have several other states in the contest on the same day. I would like to win all of those, and if I can win the others and pick up some delegates here, it would give me a stronger lead.\u201d Asked Sunday if Santorum should get out of the race, Gingrich said, \u201cNo, I think he has to make that decision.\u201d The former House speaker has said he will stay in the race until the Republican National Convention in August, despite running a distant third in the delegate count. The long campaign and the punches and counterpunches from Gingrich and Santorum have taken their toll on the presumed nominee, especially among independent voters, according to a recent USAToday/Gallup poll of independents in swing states. \u201cI think Romney through the primaries has been beaten up by the others, seen as removed from, kind of, the middle-class, average voter. Has trouble with women now, with Latinos,\u201d Democratic strategist and pollster Mark Penn said on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d on Sunday. \u201cBoy, I think he\u2019s entering the general election now kind of \u2013 a totally beaten-up candidate, and this poll is a reflection of that.\u201d But Republican pollster and strategist Linda Divall said that\u2019s normal in a campaign and there\u2019s time to repair the damage. \u201cNumber one, it\u2019s early April. Number two, when you look at it with registered voters, the margin becomes much closer. Thirdly, this is not atypical in a very competitive Republican primary, that our nominee tends to go down,\u201d she told \u201cState of the Union\u201d anchor Candy Crowley. \u201cThe other thing that\u2019s stymieing Mitt Romney somewhat is the perception of the Republican Party, which has also suffered a little bit of a beating,\u201d she said. \u201cSo, I think as the Romney campaign is able to regroup, bring in their general election team and strike some very clear themes between himself and the president, which they started to do with the speeches the last few days \u2026 you\u2019ll see a pretty stark contrast in terms of what is the direction that this country should be pursuing \u2013 in terms of the economy and jobs and getting the deficit under control.\u201d In all but conceding the GOP race, Gingrich said he won\u2019t give up on trying to influence the party\u2019s platform that emerges going into the general election. \u201cI think platforms matter in the long run in the evolution of the party. And the party is more than just a presidential candidate \u2013 it\u2019s Senate candidates, House candidates, state legislators,\u201d he said. Gingrich said Sunday that he thinks Romney will adopt some of the positions that he\u2019s advocated: energy independence, personal Social Security accounts, keeping the government from trying to impose itself on religious values and paying down the debt. He said revenue from expanding domestic energy should be directed toward that. And Gingrich said he has already talked to Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus about working in the fall \u201cto help defeat Obama any way I could \u2013 whatever the team thinks I can do to be helpful, I would do.\u201d Beyond that, he said he wouldn\u2019t want to serve in a Romney administration and would rather \u201cgo back to a post-political career.\u201d CNN\u2019s Marlena Baldacci, Kevin Bohn, John Helton and Kevin Liptak contributed to this report.",

But that time hasn\u2019t come yet. \u201cI think you have to be realistic, given the size of his organization, given the number of primaries he\u2019s won.  He is far and away the most likely Republican nominee,\u201d Gingrich said on \u201cFox News Sunday.\u201d  \u201cAnd if he does get to 1,144 delegates, I\u2019ll support him.  I\u2019ll do everything I can this fall to help him defeat (President Barack) Obama.\u201d But while he appears to accept Romney\u2019s inevitable nomination, Gingrich won\u2019t give up on trying to influence the party\u2019s platform that emerges going into the general election. \u201cI think platforms matter in the long run in the evolution of the party.  And the party is more than just a presidential candidate \u2013 it\u2019s Senate candidates, House candidates, state legislators,\u201d he said. Gingrich capitalized on conservatives\u2019 misgivings about Romney early in the campaign. Strong debate performances while conservative rivals Rick Perry, Herman Cain and Michele Bachmann faltered propelled him to the top of polls late last year. But Romney\u2019s machine interrupted his \u201cglide path\u201d to the nomination with a barrage of attack ads. \u201cI\u2019d say the glide path started to have to run into anti-aircraft called \u2018Romney,\u2019 \u201d Gingrich said Sunday. The Campaign Trail Is the GOP waging a 'war on women?' Media declare GOP race over The critical voting blocs of 2012 Despite the vicious personal attacks, Gingrich said he accepts that as part of the game. \u201cI hit him as hard as I could.  He hit me hard as he could.  It turned out he had more things to hit with than I did.  And that\u2019s part of the business,\u201d he said. Gingrich said he thinks Rick Santorum, Romney\u2019s nearest pursuer, is seeing that now in Santorum\u2019s home state of Pennsylvania, which votes with four other states on April 24. While Romney tries to focus on the general election campaign against Obama, a super PAC supporting him will reportedly launch a $2 million ad blitz in Pennsylvania in an effort to land a knockout blow on Santorum. \u201cit\u2019s clear that Governor Romney has done a very good of building a very substantial machine.  And I think Santorum is discovering in Pennsylvania right now \u2013 it\u2019s a challenge,\u201d Gingrich said. Santorum canceled campaign events for Monday after daughter Isabella, who suffers from a chromosomal condition called Trisomy 18, was hospitalized for the second time this year. He had not announced public events for the coming week but his campaign had previously said he would resume campaigning Monday after taking the Easter weekend off. After speculation arose that Santorum might be preparing to drop out, his campaign on Saturday released a schedule of events for Tuesday through Friday. Asked Sunday if Santorum should get out of the race, Gingrich said, \u201cNo, I think he has to make that decision.\u201d The long campaign and the punches and counterpunches from Romney and Santorum have taken their toll on the presumed nominee, especially among independent voters, according to a recent USAToday/Gallup poll of independents in swing states. \u201cI think Romney through the primaries has been beaten up by the others, seen as removed from, kind of, the middle-class, average voter.

            "article_content": "NEW: Rick Santorum's campaign disputes media delegate count Despite increasing calls to drop out, Santorum stays in the Republican presidential race Pressure to get out fits campaign theme as a conservative bucking the establishment Hurting Romney's chances could benefit Santorum in 2016, analyst Darrell West says Get out Rick, a growing Republican chorus says. Forget it, responds Rick Santorum to the calls to drop his increasingly long-shot bid for the GOP presidential nomination. The pressure to withdraw is actually incentive for Santorum to stay in the race. It keeps the media spotlight on him and bolsters the image he constantly projects of himself as the lone conservative battling the GOP establishment\u2019s desire for the more moderate Mitt Romney to face President Barack Obama in November. Private meetings focused on Santorum\u2019s way forward Both elements are vital to the former U.S. senator from Pennsylvania, who has seen his campaign rise from shoestring status to become the main conservative challenge to Romney\u2019s front-running bid. 'Pennsylvania critical for Santorum' How much longer for Rick Santorum? McCain: Santorum 'irrelevant' in race Pawlenty: Santorum 'lashing out' While primary results and the delegate count work against him, Santorum can exploit his underdog status by continuing to hammer themes at the heart of his campaign \u2013 that only a true conservative can beat Obama and that Romney lacks conservative principles valued by tea party supporters and Christian evangelicals who make up Santorum\u2019s base. \u201cThe more the establishment tries to force (Santorum) out of the race, the stronger his argument is with the grass-roots that the establishment is ganging up on him and being unfair,\u201d said Darrell West, vice president and director of governance studies at the Brookings Institution. \u201cHe can play to voter suspicions that national leaders don\u2019t have their best interests at heart.\u201d Romney\u2019s recent run of primary victories, including the three held Tuesday in Wisconsin, Maryland and Washington, D.C., prompted more declarations from Republicans that the race was over. Veteran Sen. John McCain, the GOP presidential nominee who lost to Obama in 2008 and backs Romney this year, said Wednesday that \u201cwhether Rick Santorum stays in or not, is now basically irrelevant.\u201d Romney has \u201ca lot of ground to make up,\u201d and \u201cevery day that goes by that he\u2019s not in the general campaign is a day lost,\u201d he said. Santorum has made light of the growing calls to get out, trying to turn the issue to his advantage. \u201cI think I\u2019ve enjoyed about eight months of people saying that,\u201d he said Wednesday while campaigning in Pennsylvania. \u201cEveryone has been asking me, from the days I was traveling around in the truck in Iowa, to get out of the race. I\u2019ve never been the party establishment\u2019s candidate.  And that holds true to today.\u201d On Thursday, Santorum met with conservative leaders in person and by telephone to discuss a way forward against Romney, including trying to woo supporters from fellow challenger Newt Gingrich, according to sources familiar with the talks. A Santorum campaign statement obtained by CNN later Thursday challenged media tallies of the delegate count so far and said the race was much closer than portrayed. In addition, the statement said Santorum\u2019s campaign was working with Gingrich\u2019s campaign on how to prevent Romney from reaching the 1,144 delegates needed to clinch the nomination before the Republican convention in August. Santorum is the first to point out Romney\u2019s huge advantage in money and organization in the campaign, noting how the former Massachusetts governor and his supporting super PAC have greatly outspent him. At the same time, Santorum\u2019s campaign has demonstrated repeated inadequacies, such as failing to make the ballot in Virginia or qualify delegates in parts of some other states. Arlen Specter: \u201cThis campaign is over\u201d When asked about such problems, Santorum has focused on the successes of such a bare-bones campaign, again depicting himself as the conservative David against Romney\u2019s establishment Goliath. It is part of his efforts to contrast his own blue-collar roots with Romney\u2019s personal wealth and Wall Street background. \u201cYou\u2019re looking at someone who, you know, knows this area \u2013 knows Pennsylvania better than, certainly anybody in this race,\u201d Santorum said Wednesday.  \u201cSomeone who has \u2026 the values forged from the values here in Southwestern Pennsylvania.\u201d The candidate continued: \u201cAnd I think that, when you look at where \u2013 the contrast that we can provide in this election \u2013 that someone from a blue-collar, working-class town in Butler, Pennsylvania, grew up in government housing and who, you know, clawed his way \u2026 through the political process, never being anybody\u2019s favorite, always being the underdog, always being someone that was discounted. And I think folks in Pennsylvania have, for a long time, admired that story and can relate to that story. And I think they will again in this election.\u201d Santorum is basing his campaign\u2019s future on winning Pennsylvania when the Keystone State holds its primary on April 24. He said Wednesday that the month of May includes primaries in several states more favorable to his conservative message, including Texas on May 29. Jack Cafferty: Does he stand a prayer? \u201cMay looks very, very good,\u201d Santorum told reporters, musing about the possibility of Texas making its 154 delegates winner-take-all. However, a Texas election official told CNN that the delegates will be allocated on a proportional basis and that can change only through a series of steps involving local, state and national Republican bodies. Polls in Pennsylvania indicate that Santorum holds a dwindling lead over Romney, who is campaigning hard in the state to try to undermine any rationale for Santorum\u2019s continued candidacy. \u201cPennsylvania\u2019s going to be extremely important,\u201d Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Preibus said on Wednesday. \u201cI think these candidates, for whatever it\u2019s worth, have set up a narrative that if you can\u2019t win your home state, that spells a pretty big problem.\u201d Santorum\u2019s campaign communications director, Hogan Gidley, said Wednesday that a drop in the polls before the Pennsylvania vote would have no impact on Santorum\u2019s plans. \u201cIt\u2019s not about wins and losses for Rick Santorum. It\u2019s about fighting for freedom,\u201d Gidley said. \u201cThis campaign is not poll driven.\u201d To West,  the Brookings Institution analyst, Santorum\u2019s continued candidacy amounts to a \u201cno-lose proposition\u201d for now because he \u201ccontinues to make his argument and solidify his standing among the grass-roots.\u201d \u201cAs long as you have a platform and you\u2019re running a low-budget campaign, there\u2019s no need to get out of the race,\u201d West said. \u201cYou\u2019re not facing big debts from staying in, and you can potentially help yourself for the next time around.\u201d Santorum has hinted at a \u201cnext time around,\u201d pointing out this week that his situation now is similar to that of another conservative: Ronald Reagan, who faced calls to drop out of the race in 1976. Reagan did not, and while he failed to win the nomination at the Republican convention that year against incumbent President Gerald Ford, the campaign positioned the former California governor for his successful run in 1980. Santorum said that Republicans should nominate him now instead of repeating the mistake of 1976 by going with the moderate Ford, who lost to Jimmy Carter, but West said Santorum\u2019s underlying strategy for staying in the race appears aimed at 2016 as much as 2012. \u201cSantorum does not appear concerned about hurting Romney,\u201d West said, noting that Santorum ran \u201cvery tough ads\u201d in Wisconsin against Romney. \u201cIf he weakens Romney and Romney loses the general election, Santorum benefits in 2016 because he can say, \u2018I told you so,\u2019 \u201d West said. \u201cThat clearly is his strategy, because otherwise he would soften his rhetoric and drop out of the race.\u201d CNN\u2019s Joe Johns, Dana Bash, Gloria Borger, Shannon Travis, Candy Crowley and Paul Steinhauser contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Santorum had pledged to supporters that an Illinois win guaranteed he'd win nomination Romney won among demographic blocs he has struggled with in past contests Exit poll respondents said they would rather see their candidate win rather than end the race Romney's team will say that he's the only candidate with a shot at getting enough delegates Rick Santorum said a few days ago an Illinois win could guarantee him a path to the nomination. Now a double-digit victory in President Barack Obama\u2019s home state may do the same for Mitt Romney. First, the good news for Santorum: He held on to his edge with working-class and rural voters, winning both categories Tuesday in Illinois. He continued to claim Republicans looking for strong character and conservative bona fides in their presidential candidate. And he was the top pick among the most religious voters: regular churchgoers, evangelicals and those who think the religious beliefs of their party\u2019s nominee are important. Now, the bad news: According to exit polls, Romney won virtually everyone else. Romney\u2019s victory was fueled by massive majorities of voters with college degrees and six-figure incomes. But by narrower margins, he claimed nearly all other demographic blocs, too, including groups he\u2019s struggled to win throughout the primary season, such as the strongest tea party supporters. Santorum: We don't need a manager Romney: I can get us out of this mess How did Romney win Illinois? Will Gingrich drop out after Illinois? Male voters backed Romney over Santorum by a double-digit margin. And Illinois voters didn\u2019t just dub him the most electable candidate in the race, a title he usually claims; they also named him the White House hopeful who best understands the problems of average Americans. A Gallup survey released Tuesday, as Illinois votes rolled in, suggested Santorum remains the top pick for Midwestern primary voters. That preference just isn\u2019t showing up at the ballot box: Tuesday\u2019s Romney victory was his third Rust Belt win in as many contests. So does Tuesday\u2019s result mean voters are finally ready to put an end to the fractious primary fight? Not necessarily: Roughly two-thirds of Republican primary voters in Illinois said they\u2019d rather see the candidate they back finish first than see the race end fast. A Newt Gingrich-less race \u2013 a two-man battle between Romney and Santorum \u2013 wouldn\u2019t have handed the former senator from Pennsylvania the state. But it would have cut the Romney margin of victory by more than half. Still, a looser, more comfortable Romney was the only candidate left in the state Tuesday night, delivering a biting election night speech focused solely on Obama. He may have spent multiples more on attack ads over the past few weeks than the rest of the field put together; but on the stage Tuesday night, his GOP rivals rated a single, positive reference, almost in passing. And the Romney team is also laying out an even simpler message than Santorum\u2019s: At this point, it says, the former Massachusetts governor is the only candidate with a realistic chance of claiming the top spot on the ticket. The Santorum team pointed to his strong showing in the most Republican, most conservative parts of the state, and the delegates he\u2019ll gain in those areas. But fewer than one in eight of Tuesday\u2019s votes were cast in the mostly rural downstate. Nearly three in five of them came from the Chicago area, where Romney scored a 20-point advantage. Santorum did come within striking distance of Romney \u2013 a relatively strong showing that stands in stark contrast to a fading Newt Gingrich, locked in a battle with Ron Paul for a third-place finish in the single digits. But he still ends the night with a far bigger deficit than he began it, with Romney claiming the lion\u2019s share of the 54 delegates at stake.",

Mostly it\u2019s just been flirting. Four major candidates remain in the race after months of campaigning \u2013 former Massachusetts governor Mitt Romney and former Pennsylvania senator Rick Santorum are now trading first place in many polls, with former House Speaker Newt Gingrich and Texas Rep. Ron Paul trailing behind them. Read more: CNN profiles the presidential candidates Super Tuesday might have settled things. It\u2019s named for the dramatic effect the day has had on past presidential races. 'SNL' looks at Romney's winning streak Traditionally, the major political parties choose their nominees for the presidential election state by state in a series of primary elections. Based on the results of those elections, candidates are awarded a number of delegates that then vote for them at the Republican national party convention in the summer before the presidential election. In order to secure the Republican nomination for president, a candidate must win 1,144 delegates. According to CNN\u2019s unofficial estimate, the frontrunner Romney has 207 delegates so far; Santorum is next with 86, followed by Paul at 46 and Gingrich trailing with 39. Read more: Where candidates stand on issues The process starts slowly until Super Tuesday gives it a sudden burst of speed, often separating the contenders from the pretenders in the process. Four years ago, when Mitt Romney was making his first run for the presidency, there were 21 simultaneous Republican primaries on Super Tuesday. His weak showing convinced him to drop out of the race just two days later. There are 10 primaries and 419 delegates up for grabs on this year\u2019s Super Tuesday, the biggest single day of the Republican presidential campaign, and there is the prospect that the four candidates could split them. Neither Romney, who is perceived as a Wall-Street-friendly moderate, nor Santorum, a conservative who aims to appeal more to the working class, is expected to win clearly enough to force the other from the race. That kind of muddle could just prolong the contest, which has already proven costlier, nastier and more divisive than many party members would have hoped. The Republicans are hoping for something super this Tuesday, because otherwise they\u2019ll be left with a long hard slog.",

            "article_content": "The 2012 GOP race is starting to resemble the 2008 Democratic nomination fight The day's biggest prize is Ohio, considered a general election bellwether Santorum had led polls in Ohio but his lead has dwindled to a tie \"State by state, drip by drip. It's like water torture,\" GOP official says Since 1988, when Michael Dukakis beat his main Democratic rivals in a slew of March primary states, \u201cSuper Tuesday\u201d has usually played a pivotal role in determining presidential nominees in both parties. This year, it will not. That\u2019s because the mechanics of the 2012 Republican race are beginning to resemble those of the 2008 Democratic nomination fight, a grind-it-out battle for delegates that could last through well into the spring. \u201cIt\u2019s a muddle,\u201d said Jack Lindley, the Republican Party chairman in Vermont, one of 10 primary and caucus states that will vote Tuesday. \u201cMitt Romney will probably pick up the most delegates on Super Tuesday and then it goes on, state by state, drip by drip. It\u2019s like water torture.\u201d Romney continues to lead his foes in the delegate hunt, adding around 60 to his total after beating Rick Santorum in Michigan, Arizona and Washington state. But with 437 delegates on the table on Tuesday, and with most of them allocated according to each candidate\u2019s share of the vote, all four of the GOP contenders are certain to boost their delegate counts, giving everyone in the field a rationale, however thin, to move forward. Romney out front in Ohio, survey says Why Super Tuesday is crucial for GOP Gingrich banks on Southern wins McCain: 2012 race tenor is the problem Sabre-rattling for Super Tuesday votes? The Super Tuesday map features both bright spots and traps for every candidate \u2013 Romney is expected to coast to easy wins in Massachusetts and Virginia, for instance, but faces a tough slog in states like Ohio and Tennessee \u2013 meaning that no one is likely to emerge as an outright victor when the smoke clears. With none of the candidates boasting an across-the-board advantage, a handful of contested states will take on outsized importance. The day\u2019s biggest prize is Ohio. Though the state has 10 fewer delegates than Georgia, Ohio carries enormous symbolic weight both as a general election bellwether and a Republican proving ground. Ohio will test each candidate\u2019s ability to connect with GOP voters of all stripes \u2013 from rural, small-town conservatives to working-class whites to wealthier moderates in the suburbs around Cincinnati and Cleveland. Romney trailed Santorum by double digits in Ohio prior to his win Tuesday night in neighboring Michigan, a state where Santorum had hoped his blue-collar pitch would resonate. Santorum came up short in Michigan and Romney emerged with a much-needed win after a month that highlighted his vulnerabilities as a candidate, but Ohio Republicans say Romney\u2019s path forward is still fraught with challenges. Romney waffled last October on a tough ballot measure curtailing public sector union rights that was passed by the GOP-controlled legislature and supported by Ohio Gov. John Kasich, who has no plans to endorse a candidate. His rhetorical dance around the issue \u2013 he declined to take a position on the controversial bill before endorsing it the following day \u2013 drew sharp criticism from conservatives. \u201cRomney is suffering from the same soft feelings among Republicans in Ohio as he is everywhere else,\u201d said one high-ranking GOP figure in Ohio who is not supporting any candidate in the race. \u201cAnd don\u2019t forget, a big swath of this state is basically right next to western Pennsylvania, where Santorum\u2019s wheelhouse was.\u201d But Romney seems to be surging going into Tuesday while Santorum\u2019s support is waning. A Quinnipiac poll released Monday showed that 34% of likely Ohio Republican voters are backing Romney while 31% say they\u2019re voting for Santorum. Romney\u2019s 3-point advantage is within the poll\u2019s sampling error, meaning they\u2019re virtually tied. But Santorum had a 7-point advantage over Romney in a Quinnipiac poll conducted last week before Romney\u2019s wins in Michigan and Arizona. An NBC/Marist poll released Sunday showed Santorum with a 2-point advantage, but again within the sampling error. In the Monday poll, 15% supported former House Speaker Newt Gingrich and 12% supported Texas Rep. Ron Paul, who has yet to win a contest this cycle but could finally in low-turnout caucus states like North Dakota and Alaska. The stakes are unquestionably highest for Gingrich, who has pinned his hopes on Super Tuesday ever since his deflating loss to Romney in Florida in January. Since then, Santorum has seized the conservative, anti-Romney mantle while Gingrich has limped through February, longing to compete in several southern states where his campaign hopes his Georgia roots and bold conservative rhetoric will hold appeal. On Sunday, Gingrich said a win in Georgia is \u201ccentral to the future of our campaign,\u201d a tacit admission that anything less than a win in his home state would derail his sputtering candidacy. Ralph Reed, a GOP strategist and a former chairman of the Georgia Republican Party, said Gingrich must be considered the front-runner there because of his longstanding goodwill with party veterans and his endorsements from Gov. Nathan Deal and members of the state\u2019s Congressional delegation. But Reed said Gingrich\u2019s slippage in the polls nationally might make him vulnerable enough for Santorum to steal a win in the conservative-leaning state, where 76 delegates are at stake. \u201cBecause of Newt not winning anything since South Carolina and because people are looking for a final conservative alternative to Mitt Romney, Rick might try to come into Georgia looking for the kill-shot,\u201d Reed said. Along with Georgia, the Gingrich campaign is hoping to snare delegates in Ohio (66), Tennessee (58), Oklahoma (43) and parts of Idaho (32), where delegates are awarded on a county-by-county basis. Though his candidacy is in far better shape than Gingrich\u2019s, the coming week will also present several key tests for Romney. He is all-but-certain to win his home state of Massachusetts (41) and Virginia (49), where only he and Paul managed to qualify for the ballot. Romney is also expected to perform well in Idaho, where Mormon voters, who backed the former Massachusetts governor by wide margins in previous contests, could exceed 30% of the caucus vote, according to some Republicans in the state. But primaries in Oklahoma, Tennessee and Georgia may once again call attention to Romney\u2019s frosty relationship with hardline conservatives. \u201cRomney is just not aligned with the Republican primary electorate here,\u201d said Chris Wilson, a Republican pollster based in Oklahoma. \u201cIt\u2019s a conservative primary electorate and one in which they are looking for the most conservative candidate in the primary.\u201d Romney\u2019s drubbing in South Carolina earlier this year raised questions about his ability to win over conservatives in the South \u2013 the GOP\u2019s most reliable voting bloc in general elections \u2013 if he eventually wins the nomination. His performance in the southern states on Tuesday could either squelch some of those concerns or exacerbate them. \u201cRomney has to show some kind of lift in the South, and not just in Virginia,\u201d said Republican pollster Ed Goeas. \u201cOhio is going to be the big battle that day, but I would also look to see what happens in Tennessee and Georgia.\u201d Republicans agree that Super Tuesday will not determine the party\u2019s nominee, but it could very well harden the emerging outlines of the Republican race. If Gingrich comes up short in the South and Romney fails to demonstrate momentum, Santorum can plausibly make the case to Republicans that he is the last conservative standing. He has been claiming that\u2019s the case, even in the wake of his Michigan loss. \u201cIt\u2019s a two-person race right now,\u201d Santorum said last week. \u201cThat\u2019s pretty clear.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Mitt Romney's blunders on the campaign trail have kept him from building momentum Off-the-cuff remarks have added to his image as out-of-touch elitist and flip-flopper Analyst: \"The most dangerous thing in politics is to play into a pre-existing story line\" Rick Santorum has also suffered recently from self-inflicted wounds One step forward, one step back \u2013 that seems to be Mitt Romney\u2019s signature dance in the Republican presidential race. After receiving a boost from this week\u2019s primary wins in Arizona and Michigan, Romney made another blunder. Now he\u2019s cleaning up the mess when he could be building momentum. Romney\u2019s gaffe over his position on a failed GOP-backed amendment that would roll back a White House policy on insurer-provided contraception is the latest in a series of miscues that have played into the political stereotype cast of him: a flip-flopper, not a true conservative and an elitist out of touch with most Americans. His chief rival, former Sen. Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania, also has suffered recently from self-inflicted wounds. As he surged into the lead in national polls and in Romney\u2019s home state of Michigan, Santorum, who holds conservative positions on social issues but had been focusing on the economy and Romney\u2019s core values, suddenly shifted to the right, saying that President John F. Kennedy\u2019s landmark address on the separation of church and state made him want to \u201cthrow up\u201d and that President Barack Obama was a \u201csnob\u201d for wanting Americans to go to college. \u201cThe most dangerous thing in politics is to play into a pre-existing story line,\u201d said Ron Brownstein, a CNN contributor and editorial director of The National Journal. \u201cWhen Dan Quayle misspelled \u2018potato,\u2019 it was a much bigger deal than if Al Gore had misspelled potato.\u201d Lukewarm endorsements for Romney Senate blocks Blunt plan on contraception Romney's challenge for Super Tuesday Romney's Cadillac reference falls flat Quayle, vice president to President George H. W. Bush, was depicted as an intellectual lightweight because of a series of stumbles and inaccuracies in public statements. When he added an \u2018e\u2019 to the end of the word potato at an elementary school spelling bee, it affirmed the stereotype created around him. \u201cIt was a defining moment of the worst kind imaginable,\u201d Quayle wrote in his 1994 memoir, \u201cStanding Firm.\u201d \u201cPoliticians live and die by the symbolic sound bite.\u201d Sound bites of Romney\u2019s gaffes have ricocheted around the Web since the beginning of this election season. The off-the-cuff comments he\u2019s made on the campaign trail about wealth, some taken out of context, have added to his image of an elitist to whom most working-class Americans can\u2019t relate. Romney, whose income was $42.7 million over the last two years, joked with unemployed workers in Florida in June that he, too, was also unemployed. In January, he told a crowd of supporters he likes \u201cbeing able to fire people\u201d in a talk about insurance companies. He went on to say that if someone didn\u2019t provide adequate services, he liked to be able to find someone else who would. But critics took the first part of the quote and ran with it. In a February interview, Romney told CNN anchor Soledad O\u2019Brien that he is \u201cnot concerned about the very poor,\u201d citing the safety net in place by the American government and said that his primary focus is the middle class. But it was the first part of the sentence that critics pounced on as evidence of Romney\u2019s elitism, while conservatives said the safety net he talked about only encouraged a welfare state. Last weekend, Romney made a campaign stop at the Daytona 500. Asked if he followed NASCAR racing, Romney told an Associated Press reporter maybe not as closely as the most ardent fans, \u201cbut I have some great friends who are NASCAR team owners.\u201d And at an event in Detroit, he tried to prove he was behind the American automotive industry by saying that he drove a Ford Mustang and a Chevrolet pickup and that his wife, Ann, \u201cdrives a couple of Cadillacs.\u201d A campaign spokesman later clarified that Ann Romney owns two Cadillac SRXs and keeps one at each of the family\u2019s two homes. The 2012 SRX model sells goes for between $35,000 and $49,000. The Democratic National Committee on Wednesday posted a two-minute video compilation of Romney\u2019s campaign mishaps and TV journalists asking, in the words of O\u2019Brien, \u201cwhether he has trouble connecting with voters.\u201d In a note accompanying the video, DNC national press secretary Melanie Roussell wrote these comments \u201care windows into the soul of a man running for (p)resident who cannot relate to the lives of average Americans. His out of touch positions and pandering to the right wing are causing him to pay dearly among independent, moderate and blue-collar voters who(m) Romney cannot afford to lose in the general election.\u201d Romney admitted to reporters Tuesday in Michigan that the gaffes had hurt his campaign. His comments on the Blunt amendment played into conservatives\u2019 reservations about his core values. The amendment, tacked on to a highway spending bill by Sen. Roy Blunt, R-Missouri, would have allowed any employer the right to opt out of requiring insurers to cover contraceptives. And it would have allowed them to opt out of any services required by the 2010 health care law. (By a mostly party-line vote of 51-48, a motion by Senate Democrats to table the amendment succeeded Thursday, effectively killing it.) Asked about the amendment in an interview Tuesday with the Ohio News Network, Romney said that he opposed it. Later that same day on radio\u2019s \u201cThe Howie Carr Show,\u201d Romney said he \u201cmisunderstood the question\u201d and that he supported the bill. \u201cI simply misunderstood what he was talking about. I thought it was some Ohio legislation that, where employers were prevented from providing contraceptives so I talked about contraceptives and so forth. I really misunderstood the question,\u201d Romney said. \u201cOf course, Roy Blunt, who is my liaison to the Senate, is someone I support, and of course, I support that amendment. I clearly want to have religious exemption from \u2018Obama Care.\u2019 \u201c Blunt later said that he accepted Romney\u2019s explanation. But the incident couldn\u2019t have been a step forward with conservatives whose support the former Massachusetts governor must earn to win the Republican Party\u2019s nomination.

            "article_content": "NEW: Rick Santorum softens his claim that high energy prices caused the recession NEW: Democrats are urged to back Santorum in Michigan to try to hurt Mitt Romney Romney and Santorum make a final push before the Arizona and Michigan primaries A Santorum adviser appears to play down expectations for Michigan Mitt Romney and Rick Santorum made their final push for votes Monday on the eve of primaries in Arizona and Michigan, as new polls indicated that the Republican presidential race remains close and volatile. After a relative lull in the campaign, Tuesday\u2019s primaries bring new focus and urgency to the campaigns of front-runners Romney and Santorum as well as trailing candidates Newt Gingrich and Rep. Ron Paul. For Romney, Michigan amounts to a vital test because the state is considered home turf, due to his childhood years there while his father George was governor. A Romney victory in Michigan would probably cement his status as the presumptive nominee, while a  victory for the recently resurgent Santorum would raise further questions about Romney\u2019s ability to attract broad conservative support in later primaries or against President Barack Obama in November\u2019s general election. Romney made clear Monday that the Michigan outcome is important, telling supporters in Rockford to rally their neighbors to help him on Tuesday. Is the Rick Santorum surge slowing? Gov. Jan Brewer: Romney is the right man Gibbs: Santorum has 'legitimate chance' Romney, Santorum face off in Michigan \u201cThis is a critical time, you guys. I need your vote,\u201d he said. Romney also took a shot at Santorum, calling him \u201ca nice guy\u201d but adding that \u201che has never had a job in the private sector.\u201d \u201cHe has worked as a lobbyist and worked as an elected official, and that\u2019s fine,\u201d Romney said. \u201cBut if the issue of the day is the economy, I think to create jobs it helps to have a guy as president who has had a job, and I have.\u201d Share your view on the campaign: What issues are you voting on? Santorum fired back at Romney at an event in Lansing, depicting himself  as a longtime fighter for conservative causes, compared with \u201cthe other candidate who is running here in Michigan at the top of the polls.\u201d He also took aim at Obama, blaming the president for blocking the expansion of domestic energy production to cause gas prices to increase. However, Santorum included a dubious claim that high gas prices, rather than suspect lending practices or complex Wall Street trades, torpedoed the housing market in 2008 to trigger a recession. \u201cWe need to look at the situation with gas prices today,\u201d Santorum said. \u201cWe went into a recession in 2008 because of gasoline prices. The bubble burst in housing because people couldn\u2019t pay their mortgages because they were looking at $4 a gallon gasoline.\u201d When questioned later by reporters, Santorum backtracked slightly, insisting that energy prices were a factor in the recession while apologizing and saying he would \u201cmake sure that I will be much more specific when I talk about it.\u201d In a Wall Street Journal opinion piece Monday, Santorum proposed simplifying the tax code and cutting $5  trillion from the federal budget over five years. \u201cI\u2019ll work with Congress and the American people to once again create an economic environment where hard work is rewarded, equal opportunity exists for all, and families providing for their children can once again be optimistic about their future,\u201d Santorum wrote. Romney responded by welcoming the focus on economic issues, rather than social issues such as religious freedom and female contraceptives that Santorum has emphasized in recent days. \u201cI am glad he recognizes this is going to be a campaign about the economy,\u201d Romney said. \u201cIt is time for him to really focus on the economy and for you to all say, \u2018OK, if the economy is going to be the issue that we focus on, who has the experience to actually get this economy going again?\u2019 \u201c A new poll Monday of likely Republican primary voters in Michigan showed Santorum at 36% support for a slight but statistically insignificant lead over Romney\u2019s 35%, while Paul and Gingrich were well back. According to the American Research Group poll, conducted Saturday and Sunday, Santorum has lost 2 percentage points since a similar survey conducted February 21-22, while Romney has gained 1 percentage point. Other polls also showed a tightening race between Romney and Santorum, who came from well back to seize the lead after his trifecta of victories February 7 in Colorado, Missouri and Minnesota. The latest Gallup national tracking poll showed that Romney has erased a 10-point deficit against Santorum among registered Republicans, with 31% of respondents saying they would support Romney and 29% favoring Santorum. That reversed 36% to 26% advantage for the former Pennsylvania senator over Romney last week. Another nationwide poll released Monday, addressing likely GOP voters nationwide, also suggested that the pair have roughly equal support now. The Politico/George Washington University Battleground Poll showed Santorum with 36% support among likely GOP voters, while the former Massachusetts governor had 34% \u2013  well within the survey\u2019s margin of error. Despite the tight poll numbers, a senior Santorum adviser appeared to downplay the importance of a victory in Michigan, saying \u201cwe have already won\u201d by forcing Romney to devote major time and resources in the state. \u201cNo matter what the results are, we\u2019ve won. This is Romney\u2019s home state,\u201d said the adviser, John Brabender. Even with the drop in Santorum\u2019s lead, Brabender said the fact that Romney is scrambling to win his native state means he will have fewer resources for subsequent battles, including the 10 states and 437 delegates at stake on Super Tuesday, March 6. Brabender also said Santorum has achieved his goal of establishing himself as the major conservative challenger to the more moderate Romney in the Republican race. Meanwhile, a Democratic strategist said Monday that he was trying to get Democrats to support Santorum in Michigan\u2019s open primary as a way to hurt Romney. \u201cDemocrats can get in there and cause havoc for Romney all the way to the Republican convention,\u201d said the strategist, Joe DiSano. \u201cIf we can help set that fire in Michigan, we have a responsibility to do so.\u201d DiSano said he has gotten about 12,000 commitments from Democrats to go to the polls and vote for Santorum. However, Michigan Republican Party spokesman Matt Frendeway downplayed the idea of Democratic voters having a real impact on the GOP primary, saying, \u201cI don\u2019t think this will move the needle at all.\u201d Paul, the libertarian champion who has a devoted but limited support base among mostly young followers, was also campaigning in Michigan on Monday. The Texas congressman has waged a strategic campaign aimed at accumulating delegates so he can assert influence at the Republican convention in August. Gingrich, the former House speaker, was alone in skipping Michigan on Monday. He is banking on a strong Super Tuesday performance in the Southern states of Georgia, which represented in Congress, and neighboring Tennessee to revitalize his flagging campaign. However, a recent poll showed Santorum well ahead in Tennessee, with Gingrich far back \u2013 an outcome that would put Gingrich\u2019s campaign in jeopardy. Santorum also is leading in Ohio, another Super Tuesday state, according to recent poll numbers. Gingrich, whose support among registered Republicans in the Gallup poll grew 2 percentage points to 15% in the past week, was scheduled to campaign in Tennessee on Monday. Santorum and Gingrich are vying to be the main conservative challenger in the Republican race. In his push for conservative support, Gingrich warned Sunday in remarks at a Georgia church that liberal elitism is threatening the country. \u201cYou have elites in the bureaucracy, elites in the judgeship, frankly elites in the news media, elites in the academic world and elites in politics \u2013 and they would all like to impose on us an America that none of us believe in,\u201d Gingrich said. Romney\u2019s advantage in money and organization have helped him fend off challenges from a succession of Republican contenders. On Sunday, Romney surrogates appeared on  talk shows to boost his chances ahead of the upcoming contests. New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie, a strong Romney backer, declared on the CBS program \u201cFace the Nation\u201d that \u201cRick Santorum\u2019s not going to be the nominee,\u201d while Sen. John McCain of Arizona said on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d that he is \u201cconfident Mitt will do well on Tuesday night in Arizona and in Michigan, and hopefully that will move this process forward so we can concentrate on the real adversary.\u201d Another veteran Senate Republican, Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, also said on the CNN program that he expects Romney to win both states Tuesday. While Graham has yet to endorse a candidate, he praised Romney for \u201cgetting better and better\u201d throughout the campaign season. Romney made a rare talk show appearance on \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d in which he parried questions about what critics call his inability as a wealthy businessman to connect with working-class Americans such as tea party conservatives. Last week, Romney\u2019s comment that his family owns several cars kept at different residences, including two Cadillacs driven by his wife, came under media scrutiny. \u201cYou know, I can\u2019t be perfect. I just am who I am,\u201d Romney said on the Fox program, adding: \u201cIf people think that there is something wrong with being successful in America, then they better vote for the other guy, because I\u2019ve been extraordinarily successful, and I want to use that success and that know-how to help the American people.\u201d In appearances on ABC and NBC, Santorum  was questioned about comments last week that challenged the call more than 50 years ago by former President John F. Kennedy \u2013 the nation\u2019s first Roman Catholic president \u2013 for an absolute separation of church and state. On ABC, Santorum said the Kennedy speech \u2013 which sought to ease concerns about his faith interfering with his ability to govern \u2013 made him sick. \u201cWhat kind of country do we live that says only people of non-faith can come into the public square and make their case?\u201d Santorum said in seeking to link his interpretation of the Kennedy speech with his criticism of the Obama administration for what he calls impeding on religious freedom. \u201cThat makes me throw up, and it should make every American who has seen from the president, someone who is now trying to tell people of faith that you will do what the government says, we are going to impose our values on you,\u201d Santorum said, later adding that imposition of government values would be \u201cthe next logical step when people of faith, at least according to John Kennedy, have no role in the public square.\u201d CNN\u2019s Peter Hamby, Dana Bash, Eric Marrapodi, Paul Steinhauser and Michael Pearson contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "NEW: Rep. Ryan expects a payroll tax deal, but blames Democrats for stalling White House chief of staff  Lew won't predict a deal on extending the payroll tax cut President Obama will present his 2013 budget plan on Monday Election-year politics reduce the chances of any breakthroughs on major issues \u201cIn short, we can expect that this will not be a proactive budget built to promote fiscal responsibility and future prosperity,\u201d McDonnell said. \u201cRather it appears we\u2019ll see a bloated budget that doubles down on the failed policies of the past.\u201d The issue, a top priority of the Obama administration and the focus of congressional negotiations in recent weeks, reflects the sharp partisan divide permeating Washington as Obama prepares to his budget proposal. Jack Lew, the former White House budget director who just took over as chief of staff, told CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d that Congress should resolve the dispute over extending the lower payroll tax rate from 2011. When pressed about whether a deal would get done, Lew refused to predict success. \u201cI believe it should get solved, and I know there are people working hard even this weekend trying to solve it,\u201d said Lew, who appeared on CNN and four other network and cable talk shows Sunday. Both the budget proposal and the payroll tax issue continue a political debate over government spending that has dominated Washington since the 2010 congressional elections in which Republicans took control of the House and reduced the Democratic majority in the Senate. Obama\u2019s budget proposal will forecast a $901 billion deficit in 2013, and includes plans to make targeted investments in areas like infrastructure while increasing taxes on the wealthy. The White House bills the document as a \u201cblueprint for how we can rebuild an economy where hard work pays off and responsibility is rewarded.\u201d Given the intense acrimony in Washington, especially on budget issues, few provisions in the document are likely to become law in an election year. A protracted political fight in December brought a two-month extension of the lower payroll tax rate from last year, giving Congress more time to work out a longer-term deal. However, the same political arguments from December continue to stymie talks being held by House and Senate negotiators. Santorum: I don't rig straw polls Obama and Democrats are pushing for an extension with no strings attached, while Republicans seek to tie more spending cuts and other priorities to the plan. House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan, R-Wisconsin, said Sunday he expects a payroll tax deal to emerge, but he questioned the commitment of Democrats to work out a compromise. \u201cI do believe this will get extended, but when we make offer after offer based on policies that we know Democrats and the president have supported in the past, yet they still insist on not coming to agreement, it\u2019s difficult to see exactly how this is going to pan out,\u201d Ryan said on the ABC program \u201cThis Week with George Stephanopoulos.\u201d On Saturday, Obama used his weekly presidential address to urge Congress to \u201cstop this middle-class tax hike from happening, period.\u201d \u201cNo drama. No delay,\u201d the president said. \u201cAnd no ideological side issues that have nothing to do with this tax cut. Now is not the time for self-inflicted wounds to our recovery. Now is the time for common-sense action. And this tax cut is common sense.\u201d Obama encouraged listeners to contact their representatives and urge them to pass the extension. Lew also counseled a drama-free agreement Sunday. \u201cWe saw in December that it didn\u2019t work out so well to have a big, ugly fight over the payroll tax,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cWe can avoid that.  We have enough time for Congress to get its work done.\u201d Last week, Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, accused Democrats of deliberately undermining the payroll tax talks in order to allow Obama to criticize Republicans for the failure to reach a deal. \u201cIt seems to me that Democrats in the Senate have sort of decided to link up with the Obama campaign and make sure that on any bipartisan discussions that occur, it actually doesn\u2019t lead to a bipartisan agreement,\u201d McConnell said then. \u201cI think the reason for that becomes increasingly obvious: They want to blame Republicans in Congress if nothing is accomplished.\u201d Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, meanwhile, suggested Republicans were trying to scuttle a deal that could help the economy in order to improve their chances of winning back the Senate majority and the White House. \u201cWhat are they going to talk about if the economy continues to improve?\u201d Reid asked last week. A 20-member House-Senate conference committee is working to extend the payroll tax cut for 10 months before the short-term extension runs out February 29. The tax break is estimated to affect about 160 million Americans, saving the average family about $1,000 a year. The package would cost an estimated $160 billion, and the political fight focuses on where legislators will find the money. Democrats want to cover the cost of the package by imposing a surtax on income over $1 million and eliminating some corporate tax subsidies, like those going to oil and gas companies. Republicans have proposed paying for a deal, in part, by extending the current pay freeze on federal workers and requiring wealthier seniors to pay higher Medicare premiums. Meanwhile, Monday\u2019s budget proposal will unleash another round of political finger-pointing, with Obama and Democrats advocating a balanced approach to economic growth \u2013 including spending cuts, increased tax revenue and investments in rebuilding infrastructure such as highways and bridges \u2013 while Republicans argue for deeper spending cuts and lower tax rates. Both sides contend that their positions will bring the economic growth needed to stimulate significant reductions in the federal deficit and rising national debt. The Obama budget proposal will project that the deficit for fiscal year 2012 will top $1.3 trillion, before falling in 2013 to $901 billion, or 5.5% of gross domestic product. By 2022, the deficit is forecast to fall to $704 billion, or 2.8% of GDP, according to the White House. Senior administration officials who discussed details of the budget with reporters said it reflects policy themes Obama presented in a major speech last year in Kansas and in his recent State of of the Union address. In the Kansas speech, Obama presented Americans with a choice: a \u201cfair shot\u201d with him, or a return to \u201cyou\u2019re on your own economics\u201d of the previous Republican administration under President George W. Bush. Obama\u2019s 2013 budget proposal had to fit discretionary spending \u2013 below the limits set in the Budget Control Act approved by Congress last summer. Over a decade, the cuts enshrined in the Budget Control Act total in the neighborhood of $1 trillion in discretionary spending. Under the White House plan, discretionary spending \u2013 which generally means day-to-day government funding not including the military or entitlement programs such as Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid \u2013 is projected to fall from 8.7% of GDP in 2011 to 5.0% in 2022. However, details on specific program cuts were not immediately available. A few areas of reduction are known: The Pentagon plans to spend $487 billion less over 10 years, a course that Secretary of Defense Leon Panetta has already laid out in some detail. For example, Panetta has said the Army will save money by pulling two of its four brigades out of permanent bases in Europe to bases in the United States. Meanwhile, the Navy will be getting rid of older ships that don\u2019t have the latest ballistic missile defense. The budget also raises taxes by $1.5 trillion, including a provision to allow the expiration of Bush-era tax hikes on families earning more than $250,000 a year, as well as incorporating the so-called Buffett Rule that requires households earning more than $1 million to pay a 30% tax rate. Later this month, the president will unveil a plan to reform corporate taxes, including lowering rates, administration officials said. The administration is also proposing a series of investments focused on infrastructure, education and domestic manufacturing, including $30 billion to modernize schools and an additional $30 billion to retain and hire teachers and first responders. In addition, the budget will also offer details on what the White House calls a Financial Crisis Responsibility Fee. The tax will raise $61 billion over 10 years from large financial institutions to help offset the cost of the TARP bailout and Obama\u2019s mortgage-refinance programs. With a presidential and congressional elections coming in November, the hostile political environment in Washington is expected to prevent the president\u2019s budget plan from advancing in Congress. Virginia Gov. Robert McDonnell, delivering the Republican weekly address Saturday, said he expected Obama\u2019s budget proposal to \u201cincrease taxes, ignore entitlement reform, and fail to address the federal debt.\u201d \u201cIn short, we can expect that this will not be a proactive budget built to promote fiscal responsibility and future prosperity,\u201d McDonnell said. \u201cRather it appears we\u2019ll see a bloated budget that doubles down on the failed policies of the past.\u201d CNNMoney\u2019s Charles Riley and CNN\u2019s Kevin Liptak contributed to this report.",

Since then, it has fizzled, but this does not mean that the underlying issues that gave rise to the protests have gone away. Until last year, mainstream political discourse did not include nearly as much emphasis on such populist concerns as rising income inequality, tax policies that favor the rich, growing influence by large corporate interests in elections and the reckless deregulation of financial institutions that resulted in the 2008 crisis. It is hard to miss them now. These concerns still impact 99% of Americans. Even if Occupy protests have petered out, the movement has affected the political narrative in our country. Meet the Original Occupiers We can see Occupy\u2019s impact in the current presidential campaign. Whereas Bill Clinton\u2019s 1996 re-election strategy focused on the idea of \u201ctriangulation\u201d \u2013 taking centrist positions on key economic issues to isolate his Republican opponent on the right \u2013 President Barack Obama has taken on much more of a populist stance, mobilizing his Democratic base and economically stressed independents against an opponent whom his campaign is depicting as the quintessential representative of the 1%. Occupy activists justifiably express skepticism over how much to trust the president\u2019s left-leaning rhetoric when his actual economic policies have been decidedly centrist. Still, the fact that Obama\u2019s re-election campaign recognizes the advantage of decrying unfair tax laws and similar policies that affect middle class Americans is indicative of how the tone has shifted.

            "article_content": "Duane Jackson wants to represent New York's 19th district in Congress His goal is to establish bipartisan solutions to the country's problems, he says Faisal Shahzad pleaded guilty to the attempted car bomb attack One of the street vendors who alerted police to a smoking vehicle in Times Square that was later found to be carrying explosives says he\u2019s planning to run for Congress. Duane Jackson, a registered Democrat and Vietnam veteran, told CNN Wednesday he plans to face off against Republican Representative Nan Hayworth in New York\u2019s 19th district in the November election. In May, 2010, Jackson and another vendor noticed black smoke coming out of a Nissan Pathfinder sport-utility vehicle illegally parked in a bus lane in Times Square, with the keys still in the ignition.  Authorities later discovered a bomb inside the vehicle made up of propane tanks, fertilizer and gasoline.  The bomb failed to detonate. Jackson, who sells souvenirs in the square, said his motivation for taking his ideas to Washington is to work with House Speaker John Boehner to help establish more bipartisan solutions. 2010: Salute to Times Square heroes \u201cI think there\u2019s been so much discontent over the years, both with Republicans and Democrats,\u201d Jackson, 59, told CNN.  \u201cI hear it all the time from my neighbors in the Hudson Valley, as well as people in Times Square.\u201d Jackson also believes that there is too much bickering and \u201cnothing\u2019s being done,\u201d and claims his rival, Hayworth, is \u201cout of touch with the Hudson Valley values.\u201d The vendor was thrust into the spotlight after being credited with helping to prevent what authorities believe was a planned terrorist attack in the heart of Manhattan, even receiving a phone call from President Barack Obama. Pakistani-born U.S. citizen Faisal Shahzad pleaded guilty to the bombing attempt and is serving a life sentence in prison. Jackson said he started thinking about the possibility of elected office four or five months ago, after seeking the advice of his town supervisor and his neighbors, but his interest in politics dates back to growing up in California and being involved in student debates.  He served in the Navy and attended Boston University on the G.I. Bill, where he received a degree in city planning. An advocate for veterans, Jackson said he\u2019s traveled to Albany numerous times after former New York City Mayor David Dinkins fought to amend a law that would have ended up affecting the businesses of disabled street vendors.  He believes his background in city planning will bring a \u201cunique perspective\u201d to the race, he said. Jackson plans to make an official announcement within the next 10 days and is preparing to file with the Federal Election Commission. The attempted car bombing changed his life, Jackson said, and is helping him believe that he can make a difference. \u201cLooking at what do you do, not only for your community, but what you can do for your city, your country, and for your fellow citizens, and when I look back at it, it\u2019s like how can I make a difference?\u201d Jackson said.  \u201cAnd that difference somewhat started that night.\u201d Calls to Rep. Hayworth\u2019s office were not immediately returned. National Republican Congressional Committee spokesman Nat Sillin said the potential race between Jackson and the other Democratic candidates running against him will make \u201cgreat theater for political junkies\u201d as they vie to be the most liberal candidate. Spokesman Josh Schwerin for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee did not directly comment on Jackson\u2019s potential run, but stated that \u201cNew York voters are looking for a representative who will fight for middle class jobs and protect seniors from the devastating cuts to Medicare being pushed by Congresswoman Hayworth and Washington Republicans.\u201d",

NEW: Congressman says: \"America should be embarrassed by its leadership\" NEW: Senate leader Reid prepares bill requested by President Obama for possible vote Pressure is on top two Senate leaders to reach a compromise; next 24 hours crucial Obama says he is \"modestly optimistic\" a deal can be reached A political summit Friday at the White House left it to the Senate\u2019s top Democrat and Republican to work out a compromise to avoid the country going over the fiscal cliff, participants said. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, told reporters that the next 24 hours would be \u201cvery important\u201d toward efforts to reach a deal to lessen the harshest impacts of the fiscal cliff, a combination of broad tax hikes and deep spending cuts due to take effect at the start of the new year. \u201cWhatever we come up with is going to be imperfect. Some people aren\u2019t going to like it, some people are going to like it less,\u201d Reid said on the Senate floor after the high-stakes meeting with President Barack Obama, other congressional leaders and top administration officials. Reid\u2019s Republican counterpart, Sen. Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, expressed hope that he and Reid could agree on a plan to present to their respective caucuses \u201cas early as Sunday.\u201d Obama said he was \u201cmodestly optimistic\u201d that the Senate leaders would be able to forge an agreement, even as he warned \u201cnobody\u2019s going to get 100% of what they want.\u201d Absent such a deal, Obama said his latest proposal should be put to a vote. He predicted it would pass the House and Senate with bipartisan support. Economists warn that continued stalemate could trigger a recession as government spending is slashed, including for the military, and taxes go up on everyone, due to the expiration of lower rates dating to the administration of President George W. Bush. Diminished hope for a substantial agreement in Washington depressed stock indexes on Wall Street this week despite other encouraging economic news. Consumer confidence has also softened. Prior to Friday\u2019s late afternoon meeting, which lasted just over an hour, a source familiar with the matter said Obama would propose the framework for a scaled-back agreement that he described last week. In his later remarks, Obama described his plan as holding down tax rates on middle-class Americans \u2013 which he described as family income up to $250,000 \u2013 while letting rates increase for top income brackets. It also would extend unemployment benefits and \u201clay the groundwork\u201d for economic growth and deficit reduction. At the very least, Reid said he was preparing legislation for a vote by Monday that would include elements favored by Obama. \u201cI look forward to hearing any good-faith proposals Senator McConnell has for altering this bill,\u201d Reid said in a statement that followed his floor remarks. The White House meeting came with the Senate back in town for a rare end-of-year appearance before a new Congress convenes January 3. Boehner plans to bring the House back on Sunday. Senators from both parties earlier expressed opinions on the negotiations that ranged from optimism to frustration. \u201cWhen the dust settles and everything is said and done, federal individual income taxes are not going to go up on almost all Americans next year,\u201d GOP Sen. Lamar Alexander of Tennessee said. Democratic Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York told NBC\u2019s \u201cToday\u201d show he was \u201ca little more optimistic today\u201d about a deal being reached. \u201cSometimes it\u2019s darkest before the dawn,\u201d Schumer said, noting the renewed engagement by McConnell and House Speaker John Boehner, the top congressional Republicans. Republican Sen. Bob Corker of Tennessee downplayed Friday\u2019s meeting on CBS \u201cThis Morning\u201d as a seeming political ploy \u201cto make it look like we\u2019re doing something.\u201d \u201cThis is a total dereliction of duty at every level,\u201d added Corker, who has urged Republicans to compromise on the central issue of letting tax rates increase on top income brackets. \u201cI\u2019ve been very surprised that the president has not laid out a very specific plan to deal with this, but candidly Congress could have done the same. And I think the American people should be disgusted,\u201d he said. On Thursday, McConnell vowed his side would not \u201cwrite a blank check for anything Senate Democrats put forward just because we find ourselves at the edge of the cliff.\u201d Reid, however, argued Republicans undermined a potentially major agreement over the past two years by refusing to compromise on their opposition to higher tax rates for the wealthy. Why both sides want to go over the cliff McConnell: We are 'staring at a crisis' Scaled-back deal key to finding fix? The principal dispute continues to be over taxes, specifically Democrats\u2019 demand to extend most of the tax cuts passed under Bush while allowing higher rates of the 1990s to return on top income brackets. During his re-election campaign, Obama said this would protect 98% of Americans and 97% of small businesses from tax hikes. Republicans have opposed any kind of increase in tax rates, and Boehner suffered the political indignity last week of offering a compromise \u2013 a $1 million threshold for the higher rates to kick in \u2013 that his GOP colleagues refused to support because it raised taxes and had no chance of passing the Senate. Democrats have rejected the GOP proposals, which would extend all Bush-era tax cuts and revise prescribed spending cuts, calling them insufficient and saying they would shift too much deficit reduction burden on the middle class. One possibility is the fiscal cliff takes effect and taxes go up in January, then Congress steps in to bring tax rates back down for at least some people \u2013 allowing them to say they\u2019re lowering taxes, even if rates for top income brackets are higher in 2013 than they were in 2012. Obama and Democrats have leverage, based on the president\u2019s re-election last month and Democrats\u2019 gains in the House and Senate in the new Congress. In addition, polls consistently show majority support for Obama\u2019s position on taxes, and Democrats insist the House would pass the president\u2019s plan with Democrats joined by some Republicans if Boehner allowed a vote on it. However, conservative activist Grover Norquist has vowed to back primary challenges against Republicans who violate his widely signed pledge not to raise taxes. Even if a deal is reached, Norquist has predicted yet more budget showdowns every time the government needs additional money to operate. The two sides seemingly made progress early last week on forging a $2 trillion deficit reduction deal that included new revenue sought by Obama and spending cuts and entitlement changes desired by Boehner. Boehner appeared to move on increased tax revenue, including higher rates on top income brackets and eliminating deductions and loopholes. But his inability to rally all House Republicans behind his plan raised questions about his role and what comes next. The saga has fueled disdain for politicians by many Americans. Such contempt is deserved, said Rep. Steven LaTourette, an Ohio Republican, who is retiring from Congress. \u201cI think America should be embarrassed by its leadership in D.C.,\u201d he told CNN on Friday. \u201cThe fact that we have been unable to do things, and instead worried about our next elections. \u2026 I think it\u2019s sinful.\u201d What happens to the economy if we go over the cliff?

            "article_content": "NEW: McConnell's spokesman says Obama should give details of his proposal Boehner, Reid, Pelosi and McConnell will meet at the White House on Friday The Senate returns to work; the House will be back in session Sunday Without a deal, taxes go up and spending gets slashed in the new year President Barack Obama and congressional leaders will discuss the looming fiscal cliff impasse Friday at the White House, aiming for a last-minute deal to stave off automatic tax increases and spending cuts. The 3 p.m. meeting \u2013 which will include Obama, Vice President Joe Biden, House Speaker John Boehner, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell \u2013 will come days before the deadline to reach a deal, and after another day of Republicans and Democrats blaming each other for the stalemate. White House spokeswoman Amy Brundage confirmed the meeting, but did not elaborate. Boehner spokesman Brendan Buck and McConnell spokesman Don Stewart both tried to put the onus on their rival political party \u2013 in the former case urging the Democratic-led Senate to pass a bill approved by the GOP majority in the House, and in the latter asking for a detailed proposal from Obama. Earlier Thursday, McConnell said his side won\u2019t \u201cwrite a blank check for anything Senate Democrats put forward just because we find ourselves at the edge of the cliff.\u201d While a Senate Democratic leadership member said such details would be forthcoming, two White House officials said Obama will not send a fiscal cliff measure to Congress. Reid, the Nevada Democrat, argued that Republicans undermined a potentially major agreement over the past two years by refusing to compromise on their opposition to higher tax rates for the wealthy. Hours before Friday\u2019s meeting was announced, he was doubtful there would be a deal by January 1. \u201cI don\u2019t know, time-wise, how it can happen now,\u201d Reid said. Democrats, GOP challenge each other to act first Hopes of fiscal cliff deal dwindling Days away from fiscal cliff Fiscal deadline: Ball in Senate's court Reid: Boehner running  'dictatorship' The Consumer Confidence Index sank Thursday amid growing fears the sides won\u2019t come together. If they don\u2019t, economists have warned it could cause another recession. Fiscal cliff fears jolt consumer confidence At the least, hopes for an imminent so-called grand bargain that would address chronic federal deficits and debt appeared dashed right now, leaving it to the White House and legislators to work out a less ambitious agreement. The principal dispute continues to be over taxes, specifically the demand by Obama and Democrats to extend most of the tax cuts passed under President George W. Bush while allowing higher rates of the 1990s to return on top income brackets. Obama campaigned for re-election on keeping the current lower tax rates on family income up to $250,000, which he argues would protect 98% of Americans and 97% of small businesses from rates that increase on income above that level. Republicans oppose any kind of increase in tax rates, and Boehner suffered the political indignity last week of offering a compromise \u2013 a $1 million threshold for the higher rates to kick in \u2013 that his GOP colleagues refused to support because it raised taxes and had no chance of passing the Senate. Fiscal cliff a self-inflicted problem Last Friday, the president proposed the scaled-back agreement that included his call for extending tax cuts on households with incomes under $250,000, as well as an extension of unemployment insurance. McConnell told Obama in a telephone conversation Wednesday that he must see details of a proposal before he can figure out how to proceed on a Senate vote. However, a senior Democratic Senate source said Thursday that McConnell must first work things out with House Speaker John Boehner before Democrats divulge more. Such squabbling has left many doubtful there will be a deal before the fiscal cliff takes effect. Reid criticized Boehner\u2019s insistence the Senate act on House measures, saying Democrats and Republicans have to agree on something together. The making of the fiscal cliff problem Why both sides want to go over the cliff McConnell: We are 'staring at a crisis' Scaled-back deal key to finding fix? \u201cWe are in the same situation we\u2019ve been in for a long time,\u201d Reid said. \u201cWe can\u2019t negotiate with ourselves.\u201d Both sides play the \u2018blame game\u2019 Reid said Boehner wants to wait until after the new House re-elects him as speaker early next month before proceeding with a compromise \u2013 one that will need support from both Democrats and Republicans to pass. Boehner is \u201cmore concerned about his speakership than putting the country on firm financial footing,\u201d Reid claimed. In response, Boehner spokesman Michael Steel said Reid should stop talking and instead take up legislation passed by the House to avert the fiscal cliff. This comes a day after Boehner\u2019s leadership team issued a statement saying the Senate must go first \u2013 either by passing or amending the House-passed proposal \u2013 and only then will they act, an assertion Buck repeated Thursday evening. Reid and Democrats reject the GOP proposals, which would extend all tax cuts passed under former President George W. Bush and revamp the spending cuts of the fiscal cliff. They\u2019ve called them insufficient, shifting too much deficit reduction burden on the middle class. Instead, Reid called on Boehner to allow a vote on a Senate-passed measure to implement Obama\u2019s plan to extend tax cuts to the $250,000 threshold. However, McConnell rejected that possibility Thursday, as he sought to focus the debate on revising House-passed measures. One possibility is the fiscal cliff takes effect and taxes go up in January, then Congress steps in to bring tax rates back down for at least some people \u2013 allowing them to say they\u2019re lowering taxes, even if taxes for some wealthy people are higher in 2013 than they were in 2012. But retiring Republican Rep. Steve LaTourette of Ohio calls that scenario little more than a political game. \u201cNobody is willing to pull the trigger (because) everybody wants to play the blame game,\u201d LaTourette said. \u201cThis blame game is about to put us over the edge.\u201d Opinion: Art that calls the fiscal cliff\u2019s bluff Polls show most back Obama Obama and Democrats have leverage, based on the president\u2019s re-election last month and Democratic gains in the House and Senate in the new Congress. In addition, polls consistently show majority support for Obama\u2019s position on taxes. The Gallup daily tracking poll released Wednesday showed 54% of respondents support Obama\u2019s handling of the fiscal cliff talks, compared with 26% who approve of Boehner\u2019s performance. \u201cWe believe very strongly a reasonable package can get majorities in both (chambers),\u201d a senior White House official said. \u201cThe only thing that would prevent it is if Sen. McConnell and Speaker Boehner don\u2019t cooperate.\u201d Americans less optimistic of fiscal cliff deal Anti-tax crusader Grover Norquist has vowed to back primary challenges against Republicans who violate his widely signed pledge not to raise taxes. Even if a deal is reached, he predicts budget showdowns will continue \u2013 every time the government needs more money to operate. \u201cThere the Republicans have a lot of clout because they can say we\u2019ll let you run the government for the next month, but you\u2019ve got to make these reforms,\u201d he said this week. On Wednesday, Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner told Congress the government would reach its borrowing limit at year\u2019s end, but could take steps to create what he called \u201cheadroom\u201d for two months or so. However, Geithner said uncertainty about the fiscal cliff and deficit negotiations make it hard to predict precisely how long government measures to address the situation will last. Crisis two years in the making The possibility of a fiscal cliff was set in motion over the past two years as a way to force action on mounting government debt. Now, legislators risk looking politically cynical by seeking to weaken the measures enacted to try to force them to confront tough questions regarding deficit reduction, such as changes to government programs like Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. The two sides seemingly had made progress early last week on forging a $2 trillion deficit reduction deal that included new revenue sought by Obama and spending cuts and entitlement changes desired by Boehner. Obama\u2019s latest offer set $400,000 as the income threshold for a tax rate increase, up from his original plan of $250,000. It also had a new formula for the consumer price index \u2013 called chained CPI \u2013 that wraps in new assumptions on consumer habits in response to rising prices, such as seeking cheaper alternatives, and would result in smaller benefit increases. Statistics supplied by opponents say the change would mean Social Security recipients would get $6,000 less in benefits over the first 15 years of chained CPI. Liberal groups have openly challenged the plan, calling it a betrayal of senior citizens who contributed all their lives for their benefits. Boehner appeared to move on increased tax revenue, including higher rates on top income brackets and eliminating deductions and loopholes. But his inability to rally all House Republicans behind his plan last week raised questions about his role and what comes next. Reid and other Senate Democrats say House Republicans must accept that an agreement will require support from legislators in both parties, rather than the GOP majority in the House pushing through a measure on its own. Some House Republicans have said they would join Democrats and support the president\u2019s plan in hopes of moving past the volatile issue to focus on spending cuts and entitlement reforms they seek.

            "article_content": "Who will blink first in Washington's fiscal cliff showdown? Without a deal, everyone's taxes go up next year Senate Republicans reject a tax plan already passed by Democrats President Obama pushed his campaign stance on taxes Call it a bigger, bolder version of the deadline-driven congressional stalemates over taxes and spending that have come to define Washington dysfunction of the past two years. The latest edition of political \u201cblinksmanship\u201d pits President Barack Obama and Democrats against Speaker John Boehner and Republicans on how to avoid the fiscal cliff \u2013 automatic tax increases for everyone and deep spending cuts including for the military that will be triggered in the new year without an agreement. While the focus now is on a possible agreement in coming days or weeks, anti-tax crusader Grover Norquist told CNN on Monday that the nation should gird for long-range battle. \u201cThis is a long fight. It\u2019s four years of a fight. It\u2019s not one week of a fight,\u201d said Norquist, who has threatened to mount primary challenges against Republicans who violate a pledge they signed at his behest against ever voting for a tax increase. Financial planners: How to survive fiscal cliff With neither side showing any sign of blinking, however, the battlefield will probably shift to the Senate this week after GOP disarray in the House stymied any progress before Christmas. Small businesses and the fiscal cliff Norquist: 'Obama wants to go over cliff' Averting the fiscal cliff No deal on Boehner's Plan B Congress and the president are taking a holiday break, with plans to return to work Thursday to try to find a deal in the final five days of the year. Economists warn that failing to avoid the fiscal cliff could spark recession, and stocks opened lower Monday amid no sign of the Washington impasse ending. According to multiple Democratic and Republican sources, no weekend conversations occurred between the White House and Senate leaders from either party or their aides. The main dispute continues to be over taxes, specifically the demand by Obama and Democrats to extend most of the tax cuts passed under President George W. Bush while allowing higher rates of the 1990s to return on top income brackets. Republicans oppose any kind of increase in tax rates, and Boehner suffered the political indignity last week of offering a compromise that his colleagues refused to support. While both sides say they want to avoid the fiscal cliff, signs are emerging that a deal would come after the new year to blunt the harshest impacts. Under that scenario, legislators would vote to lower taxes from the higher rates that will go into effect in January when the Bush cuts expire, with the new top rates staying intact. The sources described to CNN three possible options for moving ahead, all resting with Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada. One would be to amend a House measure passed in July that extends the Bush tax cuts for everyone. The changes would return to higher rates on top brackets, which Obama defines as family income up to $250,000, and also could include the president\u2019s call to extend unemployment benefits and some of the fiscal cliff spending cuts. Read more: Clock ticking on mortgage tax break for struggling homeowner A second possibility would involve a Senate measure that Democrats passed in July with no Republican support. It calls for the Obama plan of extending the current tax cuts on family income up to $250,000. However, the Senate version has a constitutional problem because by law, measures that raise revenue must originate in the House. Boehner said Friday that the Senate plan has a \u201cblue slip\u201d problem, which refers to an objection that it is unconstitutional and therefore remains lodged in the Senate. While one Democratic source said the Senate version could get taken up in the House if Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell or Boehner don\u2019t raise a blue-slip objection, Republican sources rejected that scenario. Reid also could take a different revenue-raising bill from the House and rewrite it as a tax and spending measure to address fiscal cliff issues, the sources explained. With Republicans holding filibuster power in the Democratic-majority Senate, at least seven GOP senators would have to join Democrats on such a plan before the end of the year. With McConnell up for re-election in 2014, he is considered unlikely to risk angering the party\u2019s conservative base by supporting a compromise or allowing one to pass on a simple majority vote that would need no GOP backing, sources said. In the new Senate that will convene in early January, the number of Republicans needed to pass a deal would be five because of Democratic gains in November, when Obama won re-election. According to a senior administration official, the president is still holding to his promise not to sign a short-term bill that extends Bush-era tax cuts across the board to buy time for a deal to avoid the fiscal cliff. So, absent a deal that includes increasing income-tax rates for wealthy Americans, the country is still headed for the cliff. But the administration official told CNN it\u2019s still possible to resolve the impasse: \u201cThe unanimous desire to avoid the fiscal cliff will hopefully animate everybody,\u201d the official said. According to a Senate Republican leadership aide, Republicans reject Obama\u2019s $250,000 threshold for tax cut extensions. Meanwhile, a Senate Democratic leadership aide lamented McConnell\u2019s apparent unwillingness to negotiate. \u201cWe\u2019re going to be here New Year\u2019s Eve,\u201d retiring Sen. Joe Lieberman said Sunday on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union,\u201d adding that it was likely the nation would go over the fiscal cliff. Failing to meet the year-end deadline on striking a deal would amount to \u201cthe most colossal, consequential act of congressional irresponsibility in a long time,\u201d said Lieberman, an independent from Connecticut who caucuses with Democrats.  \u201cMaybe ever in American history, because of the impact it will have on almost every American.\u201d However, Norquist called the situation part of a longer process. \u201cThis is not a fight that begins and ends the first week of January,\u201d he said, predicting \u201ca regular fight\u201d when Congress needs to authorize more government spending and raise the federal debt ceiling in coming months. \u201cThere the Republicans have a lot of clout because they can say we\u2019ll let you run the government for the next month, but you\u2019ve got to make these reforms,\u201d he explained. How might the \u201cfiscal cliff\u201d affect you? Obama spoke separately Friday with Boehner and Reid to try to salvage a fiscal cliff deal by the end of year, then delivered a previously unscheduled statement to reporters at the White House. He acknowledged what has become obvious: The broader deficit reduction deal he seeks will probably come in stages, rather than in the so-called grand bargain he and Boehner have been trying to negotiate. In particular, Obama called for Congress to come back after Christmas and work with him on a limited agreement to prevent tax hikes on the middle class, extend unemployment insurance and set a framework for future deficit reduction steps. Boehner\u2019s spokesman said the speaker will be \u201cready to find a solution that can pass both houses of Congress\u201d when he returns to Washington, as now planned for Thursday. The GOP opposition to any kind of tax rate increase has stalled deficit negotiations for two years and led to unusual political drama, such as McConnell recently filibustering a proposal he introduced and Thursday night\u2019s rebuff by House Republicans of an alternative tax plan pushed by Boehner, their leader. Boehner said at a news conference Friday that his Republican colleagues refused to back his plan, which would have extended all tax cuts except for income of more than $1 million, because of fears of being blamed for a tax increase. The negotiations with Obama on a broad deficit reduction agreement hit an impasse last week when both sides offered their \u201cbottom line\u201d positions, Boehner said. In what was considered as progress just a week ago, the president and speaker made major concessions but remained a few hundred billion dollars apart. Reid and other Senate Democrats say House Republicans must accept that agreement will require support from legislators in both parties. He insisted that the Senate-passed plan with Obama\u2019s $250,000 threshold, which polls show is strongly supported by the public, would pass the House if Boehner would allow a vote. Some House Republicans have said they would join Democrats in supporting the president\u2019s proposal in hopes of moving past the volatile issue to focus on the spending cuts and entitlement reforms they seek. The possibility of a fiscal cliff was set in motion over the past two years as a way to force action on mounting government debt. Now, legislators risk looking politically cynical by seeking to weaken the measures enacted to try to force them to confront tough questions regarding deficit reduction, such as reforms to popular entitlement programs such as Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. Polling has consistently shown most Americans back the president, who insists wealthy Americans must pay more, rather than Boehner and his Republican colleagues, who have balked at tax rate hikes and demanded spending cuts and entitlement program reforms. A new CNN/ORC International survey last week found that just over half of respondents believe Republicans should give up more in any solution and consider the party\u2019s policies too extreme. The two sides seemingly had made progress early last week on forging a $2 trillion deficit reduction deal that included new revenue sought by Obama and spending cuts and entitlement changes desired by Boehner. The president\u2019s latest offer set $400,000 as the income threshold for a tax rate increase, up from his original plan of $250,000. It also included a new formula for the consumer price index applied to some entitlement benefits, much to the chagrin of liberals.

Statistics supplied by opponents say the change would mean Social Security recipients would get $6,000 less in benefits over the first 15 years of chained CPI. Liberal groups sought to mount a pressure campaign against including the chained CPI after news emerged this week that Obama was willing to include it, calling the plan a betrayal of senior citizens who had contributed throughout their lives for their benefits.

            "article_content": "NEW: \"The president will work with Congress to get this done,\" the White House says The House Speaker says his Plan B wasn't voted on because it didn't have \"sufficient support\" A bill to alter cuts did narrowly pass the House; the White House says it would veto The fiscal cliff's tax hikes and spending cuts are set to take effect in January House Speaker John Boehner\u2019s proposal to avert the looming fiscal cliff\u2019s automatic tax increases failed to curry enough Republican support Thursday night, after which Congress left for the holiday with no clear end in sight in the high-stakes debate. Boehner said earlier Thursday that he was confident that his so-called Plan B \u2013 which would extend tax cuts that are set to expire at year\u2019s end for most people while allowing rates to increase to 1990s levels on income over $1 million \u2013 would pass the House, and in the process put pressure on President Barack Obama and the Democratic-controlled Senate. But his gambit seemed in doubt later as Republican leaders struggled to get most all their members to sign on \u2013 even enlisting senators like Sen. Rob Portman, to work the House floor \u2013 knowing the chamber\u2019s Democrats oppose it. Then, around 8 p.m., House Majority Leader Eric Cantor announced that the measure would not go up for a vote as planned. \u201cThe House did not take up the tax measure today because it did not have sufficient support from our members to pass,\u201d Boehner said in a statement. \u201cNow it is up to the president to work with Senator (Harry) Reid on legislation to avert the fiscal cliff.\u201d Democratic leaders already had signaled they oppose the so-called Plan B. Obama to Boehner: 'Take the deal' Fiscal cliff worries charities Boehner's fiscal cliff Plan B After Thursday night\u2019s unexpected reversal, Republican legislators walked past reporters through the halls of Congress, and most did not take questions. One who did \u2013 Rep. Jeff Flake, an Arizonan who will move to the Senate next month \u2013 said he was disappointed. \u201cIt\u2019s too bad; I\u2019d rather vote on it tonight,\u201d said Flake, who said he sides with Democrats in backing the extension of tax cuts except for household income of more than $250,000. \u201cGet it done.\u201d What this means next in the fiscal cliff talks is unclear. From here, scenarios range from intensified and ultimately successful talks in the coming days or entrenchment as the fiscal cliff becomes a reality next year, when a new Congress could enter negotiations with Obama. The Plan B was significant because Republican leaders previously insisted they wouldn\u2019t raise rates on anyone, while Obama called tax rates for those earning more than $250,000 threshold to return to 1990s levels while extending tax cuts for everyone else. Although the House didn\u2019t vote on Boehner\u2019s tax measure, most Republicans did vote together earlier Thursday as the House narrowly approved, 215-209, a related measure to alter automatic spending cuts set to kick in next year under the fiscal cliff, replacing cuts to the military with reductions elsewhere. The Congressional Budget Office said this would lead to $217.7 billion in cuts over the next decade, short of the $1.2 trillion in cuts that would go into effect in January if the fiscal cliff isn\u2019t averted. Moments after that vote, the White House issued a statement indicating it would veto this bill. But that should be a moot point, since Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid has said he won\u2019t bring it up for a vote. Republicans consider piggybacking spending cuts to \u2018Plan B\u2019 \u201cFor weeks, the White House said that if I moved on rates, that they would make substantial concessions on spending cuts and entitlement reforms,\u201d House Speaker John Boehner said before his plan fell flat. \u201cI did my part. They\u2019ve done nothing.\u201d While the Ohio congressman said Obama seems \u201cunwilling to stand up to his own party on the big issues that face our country,\u201d Democrats say Republican leaders are buckling to their conservative base by backing off as negotiations seemed to be nearing a deal. White House spokesman Jay Carney called the GOP alternatives \u201ca major step backwards,\u201d claiming they\u2019d lead to extended tax cuts of $50,000 for millionaires. Reid slammed the two Republican measures \u2013 the one that passed and the one that wasn\u2019t brought up for a vote \u2013 as \u201cpointless political stunts.\u201d The war of words notwithstanding, Boehner, Carney and Senate Democratic leaders all said they are ready to talk. Reid has said the Senate \u2013 with many members attending a memorial service Friday and funeral in Hawaii on Sunday for Sen. Daniel Inouye \u2013 will be back at work December 27. And after Thursday\u2019s session, Cantor\u2019s office said legislative business was finished for the week but the House could reconvene after Christmas if needed. Fiscal cliff and your taxes Sen. Murray cracks wise on Plan B bill Van Hollen: GOP running away from table \u201cI remain hopeful,\u201d Boehner said. \u201cOur country has big challenges, and the president and I are going to have to work together to solve those challenges.\u201d The path toward the fast-approaching fiscal cliff The possibility of a fiscal cliff \u2013 which economists warn will hit the American economy hard \u2013 was set in motion two years ago, as a way to force action on mounting government debt. Negotiations between top Congressional Republicans and Democrats resumed after Obama\u2019s re-election last month as did the barbs from both sides. Polling has consistently shown most Americans back the president, who insists wealthy Americans must pay more, rather than Boehner and his Republican colleagues, who have balked at tax rate hikes and demanded spending cuts and entitlement program reforms. A new CNN/ORC International survey released Thursday showed that just over half of respondents believe Republicans should give up more in any solution and consider the party\u2019s policies too extreme. CNN poll: Are GOP policies too extreme? The two sides seemingly had made progress on forging a $2 trillion deficit reduction deal that included new revenue sought by Obama and spending cuts and entitlement changes desired by Boehner. Senior administration officials said Obama and Boehner have not spoken since Monday, when the president made a counterproposal to a Republican offer over the weekend. The president\u2019s offer set $400,000 as the household income threshold for a tax rate increase. It also included a new formula for the consumer price index applied to benefits for programs such as Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid to protect against inflation, much to the chagrin of some liberals. The new calculation, called chained CPI, includes assumptions on consumer habits in response to rising prices, such as seeking cheaper alternatives, and would result in smaller benefit increases in future years. Statistics supplied by opponents say the change would mean Social Security recipients would get $6,000 less in benefits over the first 15 years of chained CPI. Boehner essentially halted negotiations by introducing his Plan B on Tuesday. He described it as a fallback option to prevent a sweeping tax increase when tax cuts dating to President George W. Bush\u2019s administration expire in two weeks. The spending cut vote \u2013 similar to one passed by the House last year that went nowhere in the Senate \u2013 was added to the docket later Thursday, to appeal to conservative legislators upset about backing a tax increase without acting on spending and protecting the military budget. The House speaker\u2019s reasoning was that the passage of Plan B and the spending bill would put the onus on Obama and Senate Democrats to accept them or offer a compromise. For now, the Obama administration won\u2019t have to weigh in on the tax part of that scenario. As to the House-approved spending cuts bill, White House spokeswoman Amy Brundage dismissed the GOP alternative as \u201cnothing more than a dangerous diversion\u201d for eliminating federal funding by negatively impacting millions of seniors, disabled individuals and poor and at-risk children. In a statement Thursday night, the White House didn\u2019t address Thursday\u2019s House proceedings but referenced its top priority \u2013 ensuring that 98% of Americans don\u2019t see their taxes rise in January. The statement expressed confidence that there will be deal on the fiscal cliff but with no explanation of how, when or what such an agreement would look like. \u201cThe president will work with Congress to get this done, and we are hopeful that we will be able to find a bipartisan solution quickly that protects the middle class and our economy,\u201d the White House said.

            "article_content": "NEW: House Speaker John Boehner makes offer as part of fiscal cliff deal, source says Spokesman says communication remains open, but agreement is not imminent Earlier, Boehner offered to include higher tax rates on those making more than $1 million House Speaker John Boehner has offered to extend the debt limit for a year as part of a deficit-reduction deal to avoid the fiscal cliff, a source familiar with the talks told CNN on Sunday. With the federal debt approaching the current ceiling of $16.4 trillion, Boehner\u2019s offer will allow the government to again raise the borrowing cap \u2013 a move that has faced strong GOP opposition since Republicans swept the U.S. House in the midterm elections of 2010. The news comes one day after CNN confirmed that the speaker proposed including higher tax rates on the wealthiest Americans in a fiscal cliff deal as Congress faces an end-of-the-year deadline to act. The latest twists in the negotiations indicate a possible breakthrough in the protracted efforts to forge a deal to reduce the nation\u2019s chronic federal deficits and debt. See how government spends your money However, Boehner\u2019s spokesman said no deal had been reached, though communication continues with the White House. \u201cThe lines of communication remain open but there is no agreement, nor is one imminent,\u201d said the spokesman, Michael Steel. According to the source, who spoke on condition of not being identified further, Boehner proposed allowing tax rates on household incomes over $1 million to return to higher rates of the 1990s while extending current reduced rates for all income up to that threshold. The offer was first reported by the news website Politico. His proposal also included a chained Consumer Price Index, which takes into account changes in quantity and prices of products, and an increase in the age of eligibility for Medicare, according to a source familiar with the talks. In return, the Ohio Republican, who is his party\u2019s chief negotiator in the talks, wants spending cuts and reforms to entitlement programs as well as the tax system, the source said. How will the fiscal cliff affect you? The reforms and cuts sought by Boehner, as described by the source, appear to be more than President Barack Obama will accept. In fact, a source familiar with the talks said that from the White House point of view, Boehner\u2019s \u201coffer was insufficient on revenue and rates and had a bunch of stuff we wouldn\u2019t do.\u201d However, the White House does consider it \u201cprogress\u201d and reiterated Steel\u2019s statement, saying that the \u201clines of communication are open.\u201d Obama and Boehner did not speak Sunday, sources said. Obama demands that tax rates increase on incomes over $250,000, a stance that was central to his re-election campaign and is supported by most Americans, according to consistent poll results. The president has said he would be open to compromise on entitlement reforms and spending cuts once Boehner and Republicans agree to the higher rates on top income brackets. Boehner has been under pressure from the White House, Democrats, the business community and some fellow Republicans to give up a staunch opposition to any increase in tax rates. And now that Boehner has indicated he\u2019s willing to propose a tax rate increase, the White House will negotiate, even though the latest offer is insufficient, a source keyed in on the talks said. A separate source said there is not enough time to get a deal passed before Christmas. If a deal is reached soon, then passage by January 1 is tight, the source said, but do-able. That, however, should not be read as a sign of extreme optimism \u2013 rather an assessment of what\u2019s feasible if the two principals strike a deal. The speaker has previously offered to increase tax revenue by eliminating unspecified deductions and loopholes, but drew the line at allowing any rates to go higher. Americans already making big decisions over cliff Conservatives trying to shrink the federal government generally oppose increasing tax revenue. They are particularly opposed to higher tax rates because they say history shows that once rates go up, it is difficult to later reduce government revenue by lowering them again. Obama and Democrats argue that increased revenue, including higher tax rates on the wealthy, must be part of broader deficit reduction to avoid the middle class from getting hit too hard. Boehner met Thursday afternoon with Obama at the White House in their second face-to-face talks of the week. The 50-minute meeting that both sides described as \u201cfrank\u201d produced no breakthrough on the core issue of whether tax rates will rise on the wealthiest Americans. Boehner returned to his home state of Ohio for the weekend but was available by phone if needed, according to one of his aides. He and the rest of the legislators will return Monday to work the congressional equivalent of overtime on reaching an agreement to reduce the nation\u2019s chronic federal deficits and debt by the end of the year \u2013 less than three weeks away.

Many were leaving town, including House Speaker John Boehner, but they\u2019ll be back next week as the year-end deadline looms for the automatic tax hikes and spending cuts of the fiscal cliff that economists fear could bring a recession.

The 113th Congress is scheduled to convene on January 3. Fiscal cliff: It shouldn\u2019t be this hard The inability to reach a deal so far reflects the ideological divide between Democrats and Republicans over the size and role of government. Fears that the negotiations could end without a comprehensive agreement, such as the deficit reduction talks between Obama and Boehner in 2011, is causing jitters among consumers and investors. Stock prices fell for a second straight day Friday as it became clear neither side appeared willing to budge. Obama insists on raising additional revenue through tax reform and higher rates on top income brackets as part of a package that would include spending cuts and cost savings from entitlement programs. His plan is to extend most of Bush-era tax cuts set to expire as part of the fiscal cliff, but letting rates on income over $200,000 for individuals and $250,000 for families return to higher rates of the 1990s. \u201cThat\u2019s the best thing for the economy, the best thing for American families,\u201d Obama told CNN California affiliate KCRA on Thursday. \u201cThat will take the edge off things. We\u2019ll still have to deal with some deficits and debt problems, but it means 98% of Americans, 97% of small businesses will not see their taxes go up.\u201d One simple, controversial fiscal cliff fix Boehner and Republicans have reluctantly agreed to some new revenue, but they reject raising anyone\u2019s tax rates and instead propose eliminating deductions and loopholes. Before meeting Obama on Thursday, Boehner told reporters the president has yet to offer a plan that \u201cis truly balanced and begins to solve our spending problem.\u201d Republicans note that 71% of every tax dollar now goes to support Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, as well as paying interest on the national debt, and they say the cost of those items would equal all federal tax revenue in 2026 unless changes are made. \u201cThe president wants to pretend spending isn\u2019t the problem,\u201d Boehner said. \u201cThat\u2019s why we don\u2019t have an agreement.\u201d Minutes before he spoke, House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi argued Obama and Congress already cut spending in budget battles of the past two years. Simply cutting more, she said, could hurt the economy. Daschle and Lott: Here\u2019s how to make a deal \u201cYou\u2019re not going to reduce the deficit by \u2026 only cutting your way to it because you will cut the prospects for job creation, which produce revenue,\u201d Pelosi said. At the White House, spokesman Jay Carney complained Republicans haven\u2019t offered details on which deductions or loopholes they would eliminate to raise revenue. Regardless, he reiterated Obama will agree to a deal only if it involves tax rates going up for the top 2% of Americans and extending tax cuts for all others \u2013 a proposal some Republicans have said they can accept as a first step to move beyond the deal-breaking dispute. Obama and Democrats want Boehner to hold a vote on the president\u2019s tax plan, which the Senate has passed. Boehner avoided a direct answer when asked Thursday about a possible vote. Even Asia worried about the \u2018cliff\u2019 Republican reluctance to raise tax rates stems from the conservative quest to shrink government and the percentage of federal spending as part of the overall economy. Traditionally, raising taxes to fund increased spending is much easier than lowering rates to reduce the money feeding the federal belly. Democrats argue that Republican efforts to reduce federal deficits through cost-cutting alone would worsen an already difficult situation for middle-class Americans facing stagnant wages, rising costs and reduced opportunity. In particular, Democrats consider entitlement programs to be the foundation of the social contract with Americans and therefore question pushes to cut them. Instead, they insist the programs can be strengthened through improved efficiency and other reforms, such as the $700 billion in Medicare savings under Obama\u2019s 2010 health care reform law. Polls consistently show the public favors Obama\u2019s position of raising taxes on wealthy Americans in order to minimize cuts. By the numbers: Fiscal cliff Nearly half of Americans \u2013 49% \u2013 approve the president\u2019s handling of the talks, compared with 25% who say Boehner is doing a good job, according to an ABC News/Washington Post poll released Wednesday. Meanwhile, a Bloomberg National Poll found nearly two-thirds of respondents, including nearly 50% of Republicans, believe Obama\u2019s re-election gave him a mandate to seek higher taxes on the wealthy. Regardless of which side of the debate citizens fall, experts agree almost everyone will be affected if a deal isn\u2019t struck. Two former Senate majority leaders said Thursday both sides must be ready to compromise. \u201cThe simplest way to put it is that we\u2019re at 24% spending, we\u2019re at 16% revenue,\u201d said Tom Daschle, a former Democratic senator from South Dakota. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to bring those two closer together, and that\u2019s how you get a balanced budget, and ultimately that\u2019s how you get fiscal responsibility. \u2026 It can be done.\u201d To Trent Lott, a former Republican senator from Mississippi, it comes down to the principal negotiators. \u201cThere\u2019ll come a moment when the speaker \u2026 and the president will have to make a decision,\u201d Lott said. \u201cBut they need to do it in concert. \u201cIt\u2019s like directing the orchestra. You\u2019ve got to have the winds and the brass come together, and they\u2019re not quite there.\u201d How is the fiscal cliff affecting you?

            "article_content": "NEW: President Obama reiterates his call for the wealthy to pay more taxes Obama, House Speaker John Boehner have three weeks to reach a deal Automatic tax hikes and spending cuts are set to take effect on January 1 The two sides are talking to each other, but revealing little It\u2019s crunch time for avoiding the fiscal cliff as President Barack Obama and House Speaker John Boehner and their aides hold private talks on issues that will impact every American. Three weeks remain to cut a deal before the automatic tax hikes and spending cuts of the fiscal cliff go into effect on January 1. Obama and Boehner met face-to-face on Sunday for the first time since November 16. It also was their first one-on-one meeting in more than a year, when talks broke down on a comprehensive agreement to reduce the nation\u2019s chronic federal deficits and debt. In a rare display of bipartisan concurrence, both sides issued identical statements after the meeting that said no details would be forthcoming. Staff on both sides also have been talking, but few details were available. How will the \u2018fiscal cliff\u2019 affect you? Visualize the fiscal cliff iReporters sound off on the fiscal cliff What if we go off the fiscal cliff? \u201cI\u2019m willing to compromise a little bit,\u201d Obama said Monday in a campaign-style speech to a Michigan diesel engine plant. However, he continued to insist on higher tax rates on the wealthiest Americans, saying \u201cthat\u2019s a principle I\u2019m not going to compromise on.\u201d Boehner\u2019s spokesman, meanwhile, said the latest Republican offer \u2013 which rejects Obama\u2019s call for rates to rise on the highest tax brackets \u2013 remained the GOP position. The outline for a deal has become clear in recent weeks. Both sides agree that more revenue from taxes should be part of the equation, with Obama seeking $1.6 trillion and Republicans offering $800 billion. However, Boehner\u2019s side wants additional revenue to come from tax reform, such as eliminating some deductions and loopholes, while Obama demands the higher tax rates on  income over $250,000 for families as part of the equation. Boehner and Republicans also seek savings from entitlement programs such as Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid totaling another $800 billion or so, while Obama has proposed $400 billion in reduced entitlement costs. Social Security would not be included. Another sticky issue \u2013 whether the need to raise the federal debt ceiling early next year should be part of the discussion \u2013 also appears unresolved. Obama says absolutely not, while Boehner says that any increase in the federal borrowing limit must be offset by spending cuts. It remains unclear if a deal will happen before the end of the year or if the negotiations will carry over into 2013, after the fiscal cliff takes effect. Read more: Americans already making big decisions over cliff While economists warn that going over the fiscal cliff could lead to recession, the administration has signaled it can delay some of the effects to allow time to work out an agreement. Without action now, the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center estimates that middle-class families would pay about $2,000 a year more in taxes. Even with a deal, revisions in the tax code and other changes would mean everyone pays a bit more starting next year. All signs point toward a two-step approach sought by the newly re-elected Obama. Fiscal cliff and cost of doing nothing The fiscal cliff and food safety Gross: U.S. needs $16T deficit plan An initial agreement reached now would extend current tax rates for most people while letting rates return to higher levels of the Clinton era on the two highest income brackets. Republicans oppose any tax rate hike, so a possible compromise would increase the income threshold for the higher rates to kick in above the $250,000 figure sought by Obama. Such an agreement would put off the main worry of the fiscal cliff \u2013 expiration of Bush-era tax cuts that would result in higher rates for everyone. Obama and Democrats say they would then be ready to negotiate significant savings from entitlement programs, while Republicans say they need to first see commitment on entitlement reforms before accepting any higher tax rates. \u201cThe Republican offer made last week remains the Republican offer, and we continue to wait for the president to identify the spending cuts he\u2019s willing to make as part of the \u2018balanced\u2019 approach he promised the American people,\u201d said Boehner spokesman Michael Steel. Meanwhile, White House spokesman Jay Carney told reporters that Republicans have failed to fully explain their proposal to increase revenue by $800 billion. \u201cThe president is the only party to put forward a plan with specificity on both the spending and revenue side,\u201d Carney said, describing the Republican plan so far as \u201cunnamed closures in loopholes and unnamed caps in deductions.\u201d To move forward, he continued, \u201cRepublicans have to recognize that we cannot afford, the public does not support, and it is economically a bad idea to extend tax cuts for millionaires and billionaires and those making over $250,000.\u201d Pressure for some kind of agreement now increases daily. Some in Congress warn that the legislative process will need two weeks to work through potentially complex measures from any proposed deal, meaning a de facto deadline of Friday may exist for negotiators. At the same time, voices from inside and outside the process say something must happen now. On Sunday, International Monetary Fund chief Christine Lagarde echoed numerous economic experts in predicting a sharp drop in confidence and \u201czero\u201d U.S. economic growth if there\u2019s no agreement. The tax issue was a main November election campaign topic, with Obama saying the wealthiest Americans must pay more and Republicans opposing any tax rate increase. Four polls in the past two weeks, including a new one released Monday, show that more Americans support Obama\u2019s proposal. From my home to the House: How to fix the fiscal cliff The Senate has passed a measure that holds down tax rates on income below $250,000 for families, as sought by Obama, while letting rates go up to 1990s levels for higher earners. Obama and Democrats say House passage of that proposal would clear the way for a broader deal. However, House Republicans refuse to bring it up for a vote amid cracks in the GOP facade against a rate hike. Sen. Bob Corker of Tennessee said Sunday that he would support raising taxes on the top 2% of income earners, arguing that it will better position Republicans to negotiate for larger spending cuts to Social Security and Medicare despite opposition from many Democrats. \u201cA lot of people are putting forth a theory, and I actually think it has merit, where you go ahead and give the president \u2026 the rate increase on the top 2%, and all of a sudden the shift goes back to entitlements,\u201d Corker said on \u201cFox News Sunday.\u201d Fellow Republican Sens. Tom Coburn of Oklahoma and Susan Collins and Olympia Snowe of Maine also have said they could vote for such a limited tax hike. On the House side, Rep. Tom Cole of Oklahoma reiterated Sunday that he could go along with higher rates on the wealthy. \u201cYou have to do something, and doing something requires the cooperation of the Senate, which the Democrats run, and the signature of the president,\u201d he said on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union.\u201d Meanwhile, conservative colleague Rep. Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee refused to budge from GOP orthodoxy against higher tax rates. Even though Obama won re-election and Democrats increased their Senate majority while narrowing the Republican majority in the House, she insisted that the November vote showed that voters \u201cclearly said we don\u2019t want our taxes to go up.\u201d Opinion: Congress\u2019 fiscal moment of truth CNN\u2019s Jessica Yellin and Greg Botelho contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "President Obama reiterates his call for higher tax rates on the wealthy Frustration mounts as a deal to avoid the fiscal cliff remains out of reach FedEx chief: Top business leaders look at Washington with \"dismay\" Polls show Americans would blame Republicans if no agreement emerges If insanity is doing the same thing repeatedly and expecting a different result, then continuing negotiations on a deal to avoid the fiscal cliff might amount to little more than crazy talk. The same players are arguing about the same issue \u2013 taxes \u2013 in a repeat of budget showdowns of the past two years that failed to reach a comprehensive agreement. President Barack Obama\u2019s re-election in November, coupled with a perceived desire by congressional leaders to shed their reputation of dysfunction, raised expectations for a possible deal. However, with four weeks to go until the automatic tax hikes and spending cuts of the fiscal cliff get triggered, the two sides remain unable to resolve a central issue \u2013 whether wealthy Americans should pay more taxes than they do now. Opinion: Beware the fiscal cliff deniers No sign of fiscal cliff deal progress Johnson: 'Obama show us your plan' GOP deal rejected by White House Compromise harder than 20 years ago Fred Smith, the chief executive officer of FedEx Corp., considered a bellwether on the economy, told CNN Tuesday that he and other top business leaders \u201clook at the situation in Washington with complete amazement and dismay.\u201d \u201cThe problem is the ideological pinnings on both sides of this argument are so difficult to bridge,\u201d Smith said, adding it will \u201cbe hard for them to get a deal.\u201d Polls show that more Americans will blame Republicans, instead of Obama and Democrats, if there is no deal and the nation goes over the fiscal cliff. A Washington Post/Pew Research Center survey released Tuesday put the margin at 53%-27% in citing Republicans or Obama. A CNN/ORC International poll released last week showed 45% would blame congressional Republicans compared to 34% who would blame Obama. All signs point to a continuing standoff, at least for now. No formal negotiating sessions are known to be scheduled and congressional aides said Tuesday no back-channel discussions were taking place. Obama and House Speaker John Boehner did not speak or get photographed together at Monday night\u2019s White House holiday reception for members of Congress, though one GOP source cautioned against reading anything political into the lack of interaction at a social event. At issue are competing proposals by Obama and House Republicans that coincide in some areas but differ on the tax-rate question. Republicans make budget counter-offer Obama demands the House immediately pass a measure already approved by the Senate to extend tax cuts for families making less than $250,000 a year while allowing rates to return to higher Clinton-era levels for wealthier households. Both sides agree that the 98% of Americans making less than $250,000 a year should avoid a tax hike when the tax cuts from the Bush administration expire on December 31, Obama and Democrats argue. They call for the House to guarantee that outcome by passing the Senate measure now. Once that happens, Obama and Democratic leaders promise, they will work out compromises on other deficit reduction steps sought by Republicans, such as reforms to the Medicare and Medicaid entitlement programs as part of further spending cuts. King: The battle over Medicare Tony Blair takes on the U.S. economy Andy Richter explains the fiscal cliff In an interview with Bloomberg TV broadcast Tuesday, Obama said Republicans need to accept the reality that deficit reduction requires higher tax rates on the wealthy. \u201cThe issue right now, that is relevant, is the acknowledgment that if we\u2019re going to raise revenues that are sufficient to balance with the very tough cuts that we have already made and the future reforms in entitlements that I\u2019m prepared to make, then we are going to have to see the rates on the top 2% go up, \u201d the president said. \u201cWe will not be able to get a deal without it.\u201d House Republicans led by Boehner made a major counter-proposal Monday, offering a series of steps to reduce the nation\u2019s chronic federal deficits by $2.2 trillion over 10 years. The GOP leaders gave ground by calling for $800 billion in deficit reduction through tax reform, including an unspecified amount from eliminating some deductions and loopholes. At the same time, they rejected the Democratic call for higher tax rates on wealthier Americans, contending the move would inhibit economic growth by raising taxes on small business owners, many of whom declare business profits on their personal income tax returns. On Tuesday, leading conservatives blasted the House Republican proposal that breaks with years of GOP orthodoxy by calling for more taxes to be paid by wealthier Americans. But in a sign of how politically treacherous and awkward the offer has become, top Senate Republicans \u2013 many of them conservatives \u2013 withheld harsh criticism of the plan even as they refused to embrace it.  In fact, despite their general misgivings about approving tax increases, they gently nudged negotiations forward, in apparent recognition that any final agreement would include higher taxes \u2013 at least in some form \u2013 as Obama demands. Sen. Jim DeMint, R-South Carolina, said the \u201coffer of an $800 billion tax hike will destroy jobs and allow politicians in Washington to spend even more.\u201d Sen. Rand Paul, R-Kentucky, said it would be \u201ca huge mistake to raise taxes.  It will cripple the economy.\u201d Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell, meanwhile, sidestepped the question when at a press conference he was asked directly if he backed the plan. \u201cI commend the House Republican leadership for trying to move the process along and getting to a point where, hopefully, we can have a real discussion,\u201d he said. Charles Grassley of Iowa, a senior Republican on the Finance Committee, was one of a only a few GOP senators who said he would support Boehner\u2019s plan to raise revenue, but only if there is a \u201cwillingness on the part of Democrats to accept spending cuts that are three to one or four to one.\u201d In a statement Tuesday, Boehner said Obama continued to offer solutions that had no chance of winning approval in the House or the Democratic-controlled Senate. \u201cIf the president really wants to avoid sending the economy over the fiscal cliff, he has done nothing to demonstrate it,\u201d said Boehner, R-Ohio. The White House and Democratic leaders immediately rejected the Republican approach, saying it would require middle-class taxpayers to assume a greater burden while easing rates on the rich. \u201cWhile their proposal may be serious, it is also a non-starter,\u201d Senate Democratic Leader Harry Reid said Tuesday. \u201cThey know any agreement that raises taxes on the middle class in order to protect more unnecessary giveaways for the top 2% is doomed from the start.\u201d White House spokesman Jay Carney told reporters that the Republican stance represented progress, \u201cbut is not enough progress to achieve a deal.\u201d Conservative Republican Sen. Tom Coburn of Oklahoma predicted rejection of the GOP proposal would doom any chance of an agreement. Opinion: GOP, break Grover Norquist\u2019s grip on you \u201cI\u2019m certain that if this is not good enough for the White House, we will go over the fiscal cliff,\u201d Coburn told CNN Monday night, adding the GOP offer was a compromise on taxes and spending compared to previous negotiations of the past two years. The Republican offer was signed by Boehner, House Republican leader Eric Cantor and the chairmen of committees involved in budgeting and tax issues. All have taken part in the various rounds of negotiations with the White House and congressional Democrats since 2010, including failed deficit reduction talks, debt ceiling brinksmanship that sparked last year\u2019s unprecedented downgrade of the U.S. credit rating, and a special committee that was unable to reach agreement on a deficit reduction plan. Obama\u2019s re-election and Democratic retention of their Senate majority last month ensured their side\u2019s participants in the fiscal cliff talks would remain the same. The current negotiations take place amid the lame-duck session of Congress before the newly elected legislators arrive in January. Possible outcomes include an agreement now to avoid the fiscal cliff and devise a framework for further negotiations in the new Congress on a broader deficit reduction deal. Coburn, however, worried that politics will continue to trump reason in Washington. \u201cI\u2019m okay to compromise even on some of my issues if in fact we\u2019ll solve the problem,\u201d he said Monday night. \u201cBut what we have is a game being played \u2026 for the extreme right wing and the extreme left wing in this country rather than coming together and leading and solving the problem.\u201d The GOP proposal includes $800 billion from tax reform, $600 billion from Medicare reforms and other health savings and $600 billion in other spending cuts, House Republican leadership aides said. It also pledges $200 billion in savings by revising the consumer price index, a measure of inflation. Five ways to fix the fiscal cliff White House spokesman Dan Pfeiffer criticized the Republican offer for not meeting \u201cthe test of balance.\u201d \u201cUntil the Republicans in Congress are willing to get serious about asking the wealthiest to pay slightly higher tax rates, we won\u2019t be able to achieve a significant, balanced approach to reduce our deficit,\u201d Pfeiffer said. The White House has made clear Obama will veto any measure that fails to increase tax rates on the wealthy. However, aides have signaled a possible willingness to negotiate the specific rate increase. Asked repeatedly Tuesday about whether Obama insisted on a return to the 1990s rates on income over $250,000 for families or $200,000 for individuals, Carney responded by saying the president would refuse to sign any measure extending the current lower rates. In the interview with Bloomberg TV, Obama said lower tax rates for the wealthy could be negotiated as part of broader tax reform in 2013, but only after those rates increase now. Republicans offered the plan amid pressure for a House vote \u2013 which Boehner has so far prevented \u2013 on the Senate measure. Democrats launched a procedural effort Tuesday to try to force a vote. Listen: WWJD\u2026 about taxes? In line with his stances during his first term and reelection campaign, Obama\u2019s deficit-reduction plan would increase taxes by almost $1 trillion over 10 years, a significant portion of a $4 trillion overall deficit-reduction goal. It also would close loopholes, limit deductions, raise the estate tax rate to 2009 levels and increases tax rates on capital gains and dividends. The Obama plan includes $50 billion in stimulus spending for programs intended to create jobs, such as repairing roads and bridges. Republicans object to any increase in tax rates, even for the wealthiest Americans. Instead, they want additional revenue to come from broader tax reform that lowers rates but eliminates loopholes and deductions. Democrats respond that closing some tax loopholes for the wealthy would fail to generate enough revenue to contribute significantly to deficit reduction. Coburn, however, rejected that argument. \u201cThat\u2019s baloney,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s easy to get $800 billion out of the wealthy in this country by limiting deductions and taking away options that specifically benefit only the well-off in this country.\u201d Experts have said failing to reach a fiscal cliff deal and devise a framework for a broader deficit reduction package to be negotiated when the new Congress is seated in January will cause economic turmoil. The non-partisan Tax Policy Center estimates that middle-class families would pay about $2,000 a year more in taxes without action.

            "article_content": "House GOP leaders call for some revenue increases, more spending cuts House Speaker John Boehner rejects any increase in tax rates Obama administration officials dismiss the GOP offer as not serious The tax issue has stymied deficit reduction talks for two years House Republicans offered their own proposal Monday in the heated battle to avert the so-called fiscal cliff, but it was quickly rebuffed by President Barack Obama\u2019s administration for not demanding more from the nation\u2019s wealthiest taxpayers. The GOP plan promises $2.2 trillion in deficit savings over the next decade, including $800 billion from tax reform, $600 billion from Medicare reforms and other health savings and $600 billion in other spending cuts, House Republican leadership aides said. It also pledges $200 billion in savings by revising the consumer price index, a measure of inflation. House Speaker John Boehner called it a \u201ccredible plan that deserves serious consideration by the White House.\u201d The move follows spitting back and forth in recent weeks, with each side claiming the other isn\u2019t sincere about striking a deal to avoid automatic tax increases and spending cuts in January, a scenario many economists say would hurt the U.S. economy. Senior Obama administration officials slammed the Republican plan, calling it a step backward in negotiations and not worthy of its own counteroffer because it isn\u2019t serious enough. Opinion: Beware the fiscal cliff deniers CEOs talk fiscal cliff Fiscal cliff worries defense contractors Carlos Gutierrez on fiscal cliff Mack: Neither side has credible plan White House spokesman Dan Pfeiffer criticized it for not meeting \u201cthe test of balance.\u201d Another Obama spokesman, Jay Carney, earlier said the president \u201cwill not sign a bill that extends those tax rates for the top 2%,\u201d as the GOP proposal would do. \u201cUntil the Republicans in Congress are willing to get serious about asking the wealthiest to pay slightly higher tax rates, we won\u2019t be able to achieve a significant, balanced approach to reduce our deficit,\u201d Pfeiffer said. Republicans make budget counter-offer Republicans offered the plan amid pressure for a House vote \u2013 which Boehner has so far prevented \u2013 on a measure already approved by the Senate to extend tax cuts for families making less than $250,000 a year and to allow rates to return to Clinton-era levels for wealthier households. Lower tax rates set in 2001 and 2003 were extended for two years as part of budget talks in 2010. In line with his stances during his first term and re-election campaign, Obama\u2019s deficit-reduction plan would increase tax revenue by almost $1 trillion over 10 years, a significant cut of a $4 trillion overall deficit reduction goal. In addition to adding a $50 billion stimulus package, his proposal closes loopholes, limits deductions, raises the estate tax rate to 2009 levels and increases tax rates on capital gains and dividends. Opinion: A tax we could learn to love Yet Republicans, led by Boehner, have objected to any increase in tax rates, even for the wealthiest Americans. They have said an agreement must include major reforms of entitlement programs such as the Medicare and Medicaid government-run health-care programs for senior citizens, the disabled and the poor. Their plan offered Monday proposed $800 billion in deficit savings through tax reform, including an unspecified amount of revenue raised by eliminating tax deductions and loopholes. The GOP letter said the offer is based on a framework proposed last year by Erskine Bowles, a Democrat and one-time White House chief of staff who co-chaired a bipartisan deficit reduction panel appointed by Obama in 2010. \u201cThis is by no means an adequate long-term solution, as resolving our long-term fiscal crisis will require fundamental entitlement reform,\u201d the letter said. \u201cIndeed, the Bowles plan is exactly the kind of imperfect, but fair middle ground that allows us to avert the fiscal cliff without hurting our economy and destroying jobs.\u201d GOP, break Grover Norquist\u2019s grip on you In his response, Pfeiffer said the Republican proposal \u201cincludes nothing new and provides no details on which deductions they would eliminate, which loopholes they will close or which Medicare savings they would achieve.\u201d \u201cIndependent analysts who have looked at plans like this one have concluded that middle class taxes will have to go up to pay for lower rates for millionaires and billionaires,\u201d he said. And Bowles denied any direct connection to the GOP proposal, saying it reflected his view of a middle-ground approach a year ago but \u201ccircumstances have changed since then.\u201d \u201cIt is up to negotiators to figure out where the middle ground is today,\u201d Bowles said. Recent posturing on both sides \u2013 such as Boehner saying this weekend he was \u201cflabbergasted\u201d by Obama\u2019s plan \u2013 reflects mistrust built up over two years of deficit wars that have left Congress with a reputation for dysfunction. 5 ways you would stop the fiscal cliff In 2011, Republicans demanded major budget cuts before they authorized a hike in the federal debt ceiling, a fight that contributed to a U.S. credit rating downgrade. The end of that crisis was a temporary fix that set up the current crisis, which sets the stage for sharp and widespread tax increases and the start of budget cuts of $1 trillion over 10 years if there is no agreement. Experts have said failing to reach a fiscal cliff deal and devise a framework for a broader deficit reduction package to be negotiated when the new Congress is seated in January will cause economic turmoil and threaten the U.S. credit rating. The non-partisan Tax Policy Center estimates that middle-class families would pay about $2,000 a year more in taxes without action. According to a CNN/ORC International Poll released last week, 56% of respondents said higher taxes were a fair tradeoff if it helps lower-income people, while 36% said taxes should be kept low to create jobs. Listen: WWJD\u2026about taxes? Another survey, by ABC News and the Washington Post, showed two thirds of respondents support Obama\u2019s call for holding down tax rates for everyone except the wealthiest Americans. So what happens next? Senior Obama administration officials said Monday the GOP\u2019s plan was a nonstarter, primarily because they said it would actually lower tax rates for those in the top 2% income bracket and was too short on specifics. But even with no more offers officially in the works, both sides will keep talking, the officials said. That may happen as soon as Monday night, when all members of Congress are invited to a holiday reception at which they can talk to, among others, the president himself.

Speaking on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d and other Sunday talk shows, Geithner said he\u2019s optimistic that the administration can reach a deal with Congress to avert a one-two punch budget analysts say could throw the U.S. economy back into a recession. But he added, \u201cWhat we\u2019re not going to do is extend those tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans.\u201d \u201cThose cost $1 trillion over 10 years,\u201d Geithner told CNN. \u201cAnd there\u2019s no possibility that we\u2019re going to find a way to get our fiscal house in order without those tax rates going back up.\u201d Republican congressional leaders have flatly rejected the proposal Geithner offered last week, with House Speaker John Boehner saying Sunday he was \u201cflabbergasted\u201d by the plan. Geither said Sunday that the administration \u201cwould be happy to look at an alternative plan, but they have to lay that out for us.\u201d Geithner: No deal \u2018without rates going up\u2019 Will there be a fiscal cliff deal? Senators clash over deficit proposals Matalin: Obama does not have a mandate Rep. Terry: Republicans have no leverage \u201cWhat we can\u2019t do is sit here and trying to figure out what works for them,\u201d he said. \u201cThey have to come tell us what works for them.\u201d The Bush administration tax cuts \u2013 already extended by two years \u2013 are set to expire at the end of 2012. In addition, spending cuts Congress approved during the Republican-led standoff over raising the federal debt ceiling in 2011 will start kicking in at the same time, cutting $1 trillion over 10 years. Those would be coupled with other cuts, such as the end of a 2-percentage-point cut in Social Security payroll taxes and extended unemployment benefits for many jobless workers, according to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget office. The non-partisan Tax Policy Center estimates middle-class families would pay about $2,000 a year more in taxes, or about 4%. The the top 1% of taxpayers would see their tax bills go up around 7%, or about $120,000. Those increases, along with spending cuts, would cut the projected federal budget deficit nearly in half \u2013 but it would also threaten millions of jobs, especially those dependent on government contracting, and risk a return to recession, the CBO found. The plan administration officials presented to Republicans on Thursday called for $1.6 trillion in new taxes, including letting income tax rates go back up for families making more than $250,000 \u2013 a big element of President Barack Obama\u2019s successful re-election campaign. Obama also wants to close loopholes, limit deductions, raise the estate tax rate to 2009 levels and increase taxes on capital gains and dividend taxes. The proposal also calls for additional spending, including a new $50 billion stimulus package, a home mortgage refinancing plan, and an extension of unemployment insurance benefits. It would also extend the payroll tax cut, passed early in Obama\u2019s administration. In return, multiple sources told CNN that Obama is offering $400 billion in new cuts to Medicare and other entitlement programs \u2013 with specifics decided next year. Speaking on \u201cFox News Sunday,\u201d Boehner said the talks are \u201cgoing nowhere,\u201d and blamed the administration for not taking the Republicans seriously. \u201cThey won the election, (but) they must have forgotten that Republicans continue to hold the majority in the House. But the president\u2019s idea of a negotiation is, \u2018Roll over and do what I ask,\u2019 \u201d said Boehner, R-Ohio. He said he was \u201cflabbergasted\u201d by the plan Geithner put forward last week: \u201cI looked at him and I said, \u2018You can\u2019t be serious.\u2019 I\u2019ve just never seen anything like it.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019ve put a serious offer on the table by putting revenues up there to try to get this question resolved, but the White House has responded with virtually nothing,\u201d Boehner told Fox. Republicans have said they are willing to raise revenue by closing tax loopholes and ending deductions, but have resisted raising rates. More than 230 GOP representatives and 40 senators have pledged to oppose tax increases, and the man behind that pledge \u2013 conservative activist Grover Norquist \u2013 told reporters he hoped Congress and the administration would extend the Bush tax cuts a second time. Read more: Obama warns of \u2018Scrooge\u2019 Christmas without tax-cut extension Norquist said the expiration of those tax cuts would be bad, but the automatic spending cuts would be \u201ca good thing.\u201d And the anti-tax pledge, which several leading Republicans have edged away from in recent weeks, \u201chas helped the debate,\u201d he said. \u201cObviously people who want bigger government are very unhappy with the popularity and the strength and the credibility of the pledge, so they attack it because they want to raise taxes so they can spend more money,\u201d he said. Geithner said Republicans \u201care in a hard place, and they\u2019re having a tough time trying to figure out what they can do, what they can get support from their members for.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s understandable,\u201d Geithner said. \u201cThis is very difficult for them, and we might need to give them a little more time to figure out where they go next.\u201d But Sen. Lindsey Graham, R-South Carolina, told CBS\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation\u201d that \u201cI think we\u2019re going over the cliff.\u201d Graham said the administration appeared to have made \u201ca poltical calcluation\u201d to offer Republicans a plan they can\u2019t accept. \u201cMy side knows we lost the election, and we\u2019re willing to put revenue on the table that will get some political heat for people like me,\u201d said Graham, who is up for re-election in 2014. \u201cThat is movement in a positive way. Republicans should do revenue. We\u2019re willing to do it in a smart way.\u201d Graham has said he\u2019d break Norquist\u2019s pledge if Democrats help pass spending reforms on government programs like Social Security and Medicare. But Rep. Keith Ellison, chairman of the House Progressive Caucus, said Obama \u201chas the wind at his back\u201d in the talks. \u201cThe American people want him to stand up for these essential programs,\u201d Ellison, D-Minnesota, told ABC\u2019s \u201cThis Week.\u201d \u201cThe American people do want to see cost containment, but we can do that in ways that doesn\u2019t result in cuts to beneficiaries.\u201d The Senate has already voted to extend the Bush cuts for incomes under 250,000, while allowing the others to expire. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-California, urged Boehner to bring that bill to the House floor for a vote, \u201cend the uncertainty and stop holding middle income tax cuts hostage to tax cuts for the rich.\u201d \u201cIf Speaker Boehner refuses to schedule this widely-supported bill for a vote, Democrats will introduce a discharge petition to automatically bring to the floor the Senate-passed middle class tax cuts,\u201d Pelosi said in a statement issued Sunday. Mark Zandi, chief economist for Moody\u2019s Analytics, predicted lawmakers would reach a short-term deal that will limit the economic damage, extend the U.S. debt ceiling to avoid another standoff like the one in 2011 and lay down a framework for future deficit reduction talks. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to cross the T\u2019s and dot the I\u2019s on Medicare reform and tax reform, but we\u2019re going to lay out how much we\u2019re going to reduce the deficit in the future by doing these things, then throw it into the Congress for the year and they will figure it out,\u201d Zandi told CBS.

            "article_content": "NEW: No talks between White House and congressional leaders are set, an official says President Barack Obama urges quick deal on tax-cut extension for most Americans Republicans are balking at Obama's first proposal, including $1.6 trillion in revenue increases Nancy Pelosi predicts 100% of House would back a \"middle-class\" tax cut After touring a Pennsylvania toy factory that\u2019s churning out would-be holiday gifts, President Barack Obama warned Friday of a \u201cScrooge\u201d Christmas if Congress does not pass legislation extending tax cuts for 98% of Americans. The visit and speech were part of Obama\u2019s campaign-like push to curry public support  for his plan to avert the so-called fiscal cliff and the automatic tax increases and spending cuts that would come with it. \u201cLet\u2019s get that done,\u201d Obama said of approving tax cuts for most Americans, while letting rates for the top 2% go up. \u201cLet\u2019s go ahead and take the fear out for the vast majority of American families so they don\u2019t have to worry about $2,000 coming out of their pockets next year.\u201d In Washington, House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, raised alarms about an impasse a month before the fiscal cliff would set in, to the detriment of the nation\u2019s fragile economic recovery, many economists warn. Sen. Rand Paul: Cut military spending Boehner: 'There's a stalemate' Fiscal cliff could harm schools \u201cThere\u2019s a stalemate. Let\u2019s not kid ourselves,\u201d Boehner said. As of early Friday evening, no talks were planned between the White House and congressional leadership to avert what could happen in January, an official familiar with the situation said. With little evidence of a breakthrough, Obama has tried to amp up pressure on Republicans by making his pitch public. The Rodon Manufacturing Group plant in Hatfield that he visited makes K\u2019Nex toys, which Obama jokingly offered to members of Congress who make his \u201cnice\u201d list. Not on that list are many House Republicans. How to raise taxes on the rich The Democratic-controlled Senate has already passed legislation calling for the extension of tax cuts for all but the most wealthy Americans, but the matter has not come up for a vote in the House. Republicans who control that chamber, many of whom oppose any tax rate increases, have insisted the tax-cut extensions apply to all Americans and balked at considering separately the tax cut that applies to 98% of Americans. Obama says House Republicans are holding \u201chostage\u201d something that would help the vast majority of the country to protect the wealthy few. \u201cThat doesn\u2019t make sense,\u201d the president said, urging Americans to flood House Republicans with calls, letters and social networking messages. Addressing the tax-cut extension for lower- and middle-class families is the most urgent \u201cticking clock\u201d among the provisions in the \u201cfiscal cliff\u201d package of automatic tax increases and spending cuts that will take effect January 1 if lawmakers and the administration can\u2019t reach a compromise, Obama said. Without the cut, the administration has argued many Americans could pull back on purchasing during the crucial holiday shopping season. Longer term, analysts and the Congressional Budget Office have said that going and staying over the fiscal cliff \u2013 meaning the tax hikes for all and spending cuts aren\u2019t pulled back \u2013 would threaten millions of jobs, especially those dependent on government contracting, and risk a return to recession. Wall Street and big businesses are lobbying the administration and lawmakers to reach a deal. Investors have been grappling with the uncertainty over the prospect of higher taxes and damaged consumer confidence caused by political gridlock over deficits and the debt. Ellison won't hurt interests of poor Matalin: Obama's proposal despicable House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said the election and polls show public support for extending the \u201cmiddle class\u201d tax cut while raising rates for the wealthiest. She and her caucus are ready to solicit the support of some Republicans in amassing 218 signatures to bring the Senate tax-cut extension bill up for a vote next week. \u201cI think we would get a 100% vote on it if it came to the floor,\u201d the California Democrat said Friday. How to bridge the fiscal cliff The remarks came a day after the Obama administration unveiled details of a comprehensive package, widely rejected by Republicans, to avert the fiscal cliff. The president\u2019s proposal calls for $1.6 trillion in increased revenue, some of it the result of higher tax rates for families making more than $250,000. Obama also wants to close loopholes, limit deductions, raise the estate tax rate to 2009 levels and increase taxes on capital gains and dividend taxes. The proposal also calls for additional spending, including a new $50 billion stimulus package, a home mortgage refinancing plan and an extension of unemployment insurance benefits. It would also extend the payroll tax cut passed early in Obama\u2019s administration to give taxpayers more money to spend. In return, multiple sources told CNN that Obama is offering $400 billion in new cuts to Medicare and other entitlement programs. Specifics on cuts would be decided next year, the sources said. Boehner characterized Obama\u2019s proposal for spending cuts as a trifle, calling for \u201ca little, not even $400 billion\u201d in cuts to the $3.8 trillion federal budget. \u201cIt was not a serious proposal,\u201d he said. Republican aides also said the $1.6 trillion in increased revenue was higher than previously discussed. Democrats said the number should not be a surprise, as Obama discussed it during his re-election campaign. On the campaign trail, the president also repeatedly said the wealthiest Americans should pay more than they do now to help lower the national debt. 10 ways falling off the fiscal cliff could hurt your health CNN\u2019s Jessica Yellin, Deirdre Walsh, Ted Barrett, Kate Bolduan, Paul Steinhauser and Dan Lothian contributed to this report.",

Harry Reid says of Boehner: \"I don't understand his brain\" After two years of endless debate and a national election, Democrats and Republicans on Thursday found themselves right where they started \u2013 blaming each other for stagnant negotiations on taxes and government spending. House Speaker John Boehner declared himself disappointed that \u201cno substantive progress\u201d has occurred in two weeks of talks, saying Republicans were waiting for the White House to propose significant spending cuts. Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid responded to Boehner by telling reporters: \u201cI don\u2019t understand his brain.\u201d The stakes are high this time, as the nation faces an imminent deadline for automatic tax increases and spending cuts \u2013 the looming fiscal cliff at the end of the year that economists fear could cause another recession. Fiscal cliff could harm schools Sen. Rand Paul: Cut military spending Ellison won't hurt interests of poor Matalin: Obama's proposal despicable After meeting separately with President Barack Obama\u2019s point man on the talks, the top congressional Democrats and Republicans said the failure to move forward was the other side\u2019s fault. Obama \u201chas to get serious,\u201d Boehner told reporters following his discussion with Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner. \u201cIt\u2019s very clear what kind of spending cuts need to occur, but we have no idea what the White House is willing to do.\u201d Senate Democrats said Boehner had it backward because Obama has made his positions clear \u2013 especially his call to extend middle-class tax cuts while allowing rates on the wealthiest 2% of Americans to return to higher rates of the 1990s. Some specifics of the White House plan became clear later Thursday. A Republican congressional aide familiar with the proposal said it calls for $1.6 trillion in tax increases. \u201cAll of that upfront \u2013 in exchange for only $400 billion in spending cuts that come later,\u201d said the aide, calling the offer \u201ccompletely unbalanced and unrealistic.\u201d Republican aides said the $1.6 trillion was higher than previously discussed. Democrats said the number should not be a surprise, adding Obama discussed it on the campaign trail. A senior House GOP aide said Geithner, among other things, proposed an increase in top marginal rates as well as on capital gains and dividends, totaling about $960 billion. Additional tax increases would amount to $600 billion, the aide said. Several senior GOP aides said the White House plan was a step in the wrong direction. A Democrat familiar with the talks says the administration proposal includes closing loopholes and deductions. The plan includes $50 billion in stimulus spending and a home mortgage refinancing package, a Republican aide told CNN. Obama would work on $400 billion savings in Medicare and other entitlements next year, without specifying where they\u2019d come from, the aide says. The White House, after the Geithner meeting, said the president has previously signed $1 trillion in spending cuts into law. \u201cIt\u2019s time for Republicans in Washington to join the chorus of other voices \u2013 from the business community to middle class Americans across the country \u2013 who support a balanced approach that asks more from the wealthiest Americans,\u201d the White House said in a statement. Fiscal cliff countdown: Automatic spending cuts White House spokesman Jay Carney said Obama\u2019s insistence on having wealthy Americans pay a higher tax rate was the president\u2019s consistent message throughout his first term, and especially during his successful re-election campaign. \u201cWe remain optimistic that this can get done, but the president\u2019s principles are clear,\u201d Carney said. \u201cIt\u2019s not like we didn\u2019t have this debate for the last year.\u201d Both Republicans and Democrats insist they want a comprehensive agreement to tackle the nation\u2019s chronic federal deficits and debt, starting with a deal to avoid automatic tax hikes and spending cuts set to take effect on January 1. However, the two sides appear far apart on the timing of taking those steps. The dispute over how to proceed is compounded by the lame-duck Congress, which is completing its work before a new legislature gets seated in January. Obama and Democrats are pushing hard for House Republicans to immediately pass a Senate bill that would prevent most of the automatic tax increases that would result from the expiration of Bush-era tax cuts at the end of the year. At the same time, they want to discuss a framework for substantive negotiations in the new Congress that would include tax reform, spending cuts and reforms of popular entitlement programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. Republicans, led by Boehner, oppose letting tax rates on the wealthiest 2% of Americans go up by passing the Senate bill championed by Obama. They also want Democrats to make firm commitments on spending cuts and entitlement reforms now, instead of waiting for negotiations next year. \u201cI\u2019m disappointed in where we are. I\u2019m disappointed over what\u2019s happened in the last couple of weeks,\u201d Boehner said of talks since he and other congressional leaders met with Obama on November 16, 10 days after the president\u2019s re-election. \u201cBut going over the fiscal cliff is serious business. I\u2019m here seriously trying to resolve it, and I hope the White House would get serious as well.\u201d Boehner described his talks with Geithner as \u201cfrank\u201d and \u201cdirect\u201d and also said he had a \u201cstraightforward\u201d telephone call with Obama on Wednesday. His assessment of no real progress was based on both of those discussions, said the Ohio Republican. \u201cNo substantive progress has been made in the talks between the White House and the House over the last two weeks,\u201d Boehner said. Differences between the parties include the scope of a deficit deal, with Republicans insisting that Social Security reforms be part of it while Democrats say the government pension system is self-funded and therefore plays no role in federal deficits. Cole\u2019s compromise plan gets shot down Obama also wants any deal reached in the current session of Congress to include an increase in the federal debt ceiling, which is expected to be needed as soon as February or March. To Boehner and Republicans, the debt ceiling is a valuable negotiating tool to extract concessions from the Democrats and the president. \u201cAny increase in the debt limit has to be accomplished by spending reductions that meet or exceed it,\u201d Boehner declared Thursday, saying Obama would have to pay a price to raise the ceiling on federal borrowing. Carney responded to Boehner\u2019s demand of a price by calling such brinksmanship over the credit standing of the nation \u201centirely inappropriate.\u201d \u201cAsking that a political price be paid in order for Congress to do its job to ensure that the United States of America pays its bill and does not default for the first time in history is deeply irresponsible,\u201d Carney said. A similar battle over the debt ceiling, with threats of a government default on its obligations, led to the unprecedented downgrade of the U.S. credit rating last year by one agency. Geithner is the Obama administration\u2019s point man in the talks. His separate meetings on Thursday with Boehner, House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi, Reid and Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell also included Rob Nabors, Obama\u2019s legislative affairs director. Fresh off his re-election victory on November 6, Obama launched a campaign-style approach this week aimed at pressuring Republicans to pass his tax proposal. In remarks Wednesday at the White House, Obama urged Americans to call, e-mail and tweet their members of Congress to urge immediate passage of his proposal to extend tax cuts for most Americans while allowing rates on the wealthiest 2% to increase to 1990s levels. Obama\u2019s phone conservation with Boehner later Wednesday lasted 28 minutes, Carney said. A source familiar with the call said the president insisted any deal must include tax rates going up on the wealthiest Americans, a point Carney repeatedly emphasized to reporters Thursday. Meanwhile, a rift among House Republicans on whether to give Obama what he wants became public Wednesday, with two conservatives saying the tax proposal would likely pass if brought to a vote. Boehner immediately shot down the call by veteran Rep. Tom Cole of Oklahoma for the chamber to approve the Senate measure, saying he disagrees with his colleague. House GOP aides insisted there is no plan to bring the proposal up for a vote. However, the public stance by Cole \u2013 which echoed similar statements from conservatives in recent weeks \u2013 as well as his prediction that the Senate proposal would pass in the House showed an increasing desire among House Republicans to move beyond an issue that has harmed them. Conservative Rep. Tim Scott of South Carolina also said he thinks the Obama tax plan would pass the House, though he made clear to CNN he would oppose it. Goldman CEO: \u2018Country can\u2019t afford all this\u2019 Obama made clear Wednesday that he hopes public pressure will cause House Republicans to move from their unyielding stance. \u201cThe lesson is that when enough people get involved, we have a pretty good track record of making Congress work,\u201d he said. Cole and some other conservatives say such pressure is the reason to simply give the president what he wants and move past the immediate tax issue. \u201cIf we agree that taxes shouldn\u2019t go up on 98% of the people, shouldn\u2019t we take that now and get that set aside and make sure they know their taxes aren\u2019t going up?\u201d Cole said Wednesday night on CNN\u2019s \u201cAnderson Cooper 360.\u201d Sounding a lot like Obama, Cole said that \u201cif we can give assurance to most Americans that their taxes are going to be fine, I think that\u2019s helpful to them in planning their lives going forward.\u201d Obama argued Wednesday that settling the tax question for middle-class families would clear the way for the broader agreement everyone wants. \u201cWe can do it in a balanced a fair way, but our first job is to make sure that taxes on middle-class families don\u2019t go up,\u201d Obama said. \u201cAnd since we all theoretically agree on that, we should get that done. If we get that done, a lot of the other stuff is going to be a lot easier.\u201d Boehner outlined a similar process on Thursday, but demanded more commitment from Obama and Democrats on spending cuts and entitlement reforms. His framework includes what he called a \u201cdown payment\u201d for the rest of this year that would include spending cuts and additional tax revenue, but not higher tax rates. That would set up negotiations on tax reform and other aspects of deficit reduction next year, Boehner said. With the U.S. economy showing more signs of improvement in its long recovery from recession, economists point to fears about higher taxes in 2013 as a potential threat to rising consumer confidence. The impending fiscal cliff resulted from a failure to reach a deficit reduction agreement in the past two years due to long-standing differences between Democrats and Republicans on taxes \u2013 particularly whether to extend tax cuts from President George W. Bush\u2019s administration. Cornyn \u2018increasingly pessimistic\u2019 about deal Republicans seeking to shrink the size of government oppose allowing any tax rates to return to pre-cut levels, arguing that Obama\u2019s plan would hinder job growth because some small business owners who file personal returns would pay higher taxes under it. Boehner and other influential GOP figures have declared their willingness to consider other ways to boost tax revenue as part of a broader deal that would include entitlement reforms and spending cuts. Republicans insist Democrats must agree to cut discretionary spending and make significant reforms to Medicare and Social Security as part of a deficit reduction deal. However, organized labor and other elements of the Democratic base oppose any major reforms to the popular entitlement programs.

New polls this week, including one by CNN/ORC International, showed a solid majority of respondents supports the Democratic stance that any agreement should include a mix of spending cuts and tax increases.

            "article_content": "Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner will meet with congressional leaders Republican Rep. Tom Cole says the House should pass President Obama's tax plan Obama is making his case directly to the American people this week Republicans complain Obama refuses to provide a detailed deficit plan An angry warning by President Barack Obama delivered well over a year ago foreshadowed his campaign-style approach on Wednesday aimed at pressuring Republicans to compromise and reach a deal to avoid the fiscal cliff. In remarks at the White House, Obama urged Americans to call, e-mail and tweet their members of Congress to urge immediate passage of his proposal to extend tax cuts for most Americans while allowing rates on the wealthiest 2% to increase to 1990s levels. \u201cLet\u2019s begin our work with where we agree,\u201d the president said, noting the Senate has passed the measure and that both parties agree on holding down rates for the majority of taxpayers. \u201cIf we can get a few House Republicans to agree as well, I\u2019ll sign this bill as soon as the House sends it my way.\u201d To applause from the White House audience that included those described by organizers as middle-class Americans, the president held up a pen to demonstrate his willingness to sign the law as soon as it reaches his desk. U.S. closing in on fiscal cliff Complete explanation of 'fiscal cliff' Sen. Durbin: Entitlements off table Norquist: No room for GOP tax compromise Meanwhile, a rift among House Republicans on whether to give Obama what the wants became public Wednesday, with two conservatives saying the tax proposal would likely pass if brought to a vote. House Speaker John Boehner immediately shot down the call by veteran Rep. Tom Cole of Oklahoma for the chamber to approve the Senate measure, saying he disagreed with his colleague. House GOP aides insisted there was no plan to bring the proposal up for a vote. However, the public call by Cole \u2013 which echoed similar statements from conservatives in recent weeks \u2013 as well as his prediction that the Senate proposal would pass in the House showed an increasing desire among House Republicans to move beyond an issue that has harmed them. Conservative Rep. Tim Scott of South Carolina also said he thought the Obama tax plan would pass the House, though he made clear to CNN he would oppose it. The political maneuvering comes as Obama and Congress negotiate a possible agreement to avoid tax increases and deep spending cuts set to take effect in five weeks \u2013 the fiscal cliff scenario that analysts fear could push the country back into recession. Obama also wants any deal reached in the current lame-duck session of Congress to include an increase in the federal debt ceiling, which is expected to be needed as soon as February or March. On Thursday, Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner and Rob Nabors, Obama\u2019s director of legislative affairs, will meet separately with congressional leaders of both parties, aides said. Geithner is the administration\u2019s point man in the negotiations. Republican rejection of any kind of increase in taxes has been a major contributor to the inability of Obama and Congress to work out a comprehensive agreement in the past two years to reduce the nation\u2019s chronic federal deficits and debt. Obama, who demands some increased tax revenue as part of what he calls a balanced approach with spending cuts and entitlement reforms, became so exasperated at one point during the endless budget battles that he decided to take his argument to the American people. In July 2011, Obama told House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, one of the lead Republican negotiators, that it was time to make a deal or face the consequences. \u201cDon\u2019t call my bluff,\u201d the president said in ending the White House meeting, according to Cantor. \u201cI\u2019m going to the American people with this.\u201d Obama subsequently held a series of events around the country, mostly in swing states for the November election, in which he pushed for higher taxes on the wealthy as part of his main campaign theme to restore equal opportunity for the middle class. Re-elected and facing the same fiscal issues \u2013 a seemingly unbridgeable divide with Republicans over taxes and spending \u2013 Obama is again taking his case to the people this week. \u201cThe lesson is that when enough people get involved, we have a pretty good track record of making Congress work,\u201d Obama said Wednesday. Cole and some other conservatives say such pressure is the reason to simply give the president what he wants and move past the immediate tax issue. \u201cIf we agree that taxes shouldn\u2019t go up on 98% of the people, shouldn\u2019t we take that now and get that set aside and make sure they know their taxes aren\u2019t going up?\u201d Cole said Wednesday night on CNN\u2019s \u201cAnderson Cooper 360.\u201d Sounding a lot like Obama, Cole said that \u201cif we can give assurance to most Americans that their taxes are going to be fine, I think that\u2019s helpful to them in planning their lives going forward.\u201d Fellow Republican Rep. Raul Labrador of Idaho disagreed with Cole, but also said letting Democrats pass a tax increase would saddle them with resulting economic stagnation. \u201cI think right now my advice to the leadership is that they should let the Democrats pass a tax increase because we will see that the economy will stall because of that tax increase, and then they will own it completely,\u201d Labrador said, despite his personal opposition to such a measure. He and other Republicans complained that Obama and Democrats had yet to propose any serious proposals to also cut spending and reform entitlement programs such as Medicare and Medicaid as part of a broad deficit reduction deal. \u201cI think we\u2019re making a mistake that we\u2019re running around trying to think of ways to deal with the president when the president doesn\u2019t want to deal in good faith,\u201d Labrador said. What is \u2018Fix the Debt?\u2019 Obama argued Wednesday that settling the tax question for middle-class families would clear the way for the broader agreement everyone wants. \u201cWe can do it in a balanced a fair way, but our first job is to make sure that taxes on middle-class families don\u2019t go up,\u201d Obama said. \u201cAnd since we all theoretically agree on that, we should get that done. If we get that done, a lot of the other stuff is going to be a lot easier.\u201d Obama wants to let tax rates for income over $250,000 for families or $200,000 for individuals return to higher 1990s levels, while maintaining current rates for the rest of the country. While Cole and other Republicans now say to let that happen, Boehner made clear Wednesday he wanted to keep his strongest bargaining chip. \u201cI told Tom earlier in our conference meeting that I disagreed with him,\u201d Boehner said of Cole, who he described as a \u201cwonderful friend\u201d and strong supporter. \u201cThe goal here is to grow the economy and control spending. You\u2019re not going to grow the economy if you raise taxes.\u201d At the same time, Boehner reiterated his willingness to include increased tax revenue, as long as it doesn\u2019t come from higher rates and is part of a deal that includes spending cuts and entitlement reforms. Later Wednesday, Obama met with chief executives of major corporations. Congressional Republicans and Democrats talked separately with deficit-reduction gurus, including former White House Chief of Staff Erskine Bowles, who co-chaired a special panel appointed by Obama in 2010 to study the matter. \u201cWe are going to have to have real compromise. Nobody can be an absolutist, nobody can win everything,\u201d Bowles told reporters after his meetings. One fiscal cliff fix \u2013 raise gas tax Meetings and events on both sides showed the high-profile tactics being used to demonstrate to the nation, including financial markets, that a deal can happen Stocks opened lower Wednesday as investors grew increasingly concerned about whether Congress can adequately and swiftly address the situation. By the end of the day, after reports of Cole\u2019s remarks and other developments, stocks recovered to post a solid gain. With the U.S. economy showing more signs of improvement in its long recovery from recession, economists point to fears about higher taxes in 2013 as a potential threat to rising consumer confidence. The fiscal cliff resulted from a failure to reach a deficit reduction agreement in the past two years due to longstanding differences between Democrats and Republicans on taxes \u2013 particularly whether to extend tax cuts from President George W. Bush\u2019s administration. Opinion: How U.S. can once again define the future Obama made the issue a central theme of his election campaign, and now the White House believes the president\u2019s re-election validated his call for including more tax revenue in addressing the nation\u2019s chronic federal deficits and debt. Last week, Obama\u2019s former campaign manager, Jim Messina, said the president\u2019s re-election campaign and its grass-roots resources will \u201clive on,\u201d most likely as a tool to promote the president\u2019s second-term policies. Republicans seeking to shrink the size of government oppose increasing any tax rates, arguing that Obama\u2019s plan would hinder job growth because some small business owners who file personal returns would pay higher taxes under it. While aides on both sides have been talking, no follow-up meeting between Obama and congressional leaders has been scheduled after their initial post-election discussion on November 16. Time running out on debt ceiling Instead, Obama met Tuesday with small business owners to launch his week of campaign-style events. Andra Rush, who founded Rush Trucking of Wayne, Michigan, said her message to Obama was that failure to extend the tax cuts to the middle class could stall what she called new economic momentum in the country. \u201cI would have higher tax rates,\u201d Rush conceded, adding that it was more important for \u201cordinary Americans\u201d to have more money to spend instead of paying it in taxes if everyone\u2019s rates go up. Boehner and other influential GOP figures have declared their willingness to consider other ways to boost tax revenue as part of a broader deal that includes entitlement reforms and spending cuts. That position undermines the no-tax-increase pledge championed by anti-tax crusader Grover Norquist, which Democrats consider to be a major impediment to a deficit reduction deal. House Republicans launch PR offensive on fiscal cliff Republicans insist Democrats must agree to cut discretionary spending and make significant reforms to Medicare and Social Security as part of a deficit reduction deal. However, organized labor and other elements of the Democratic base oppose any major reforms to the popular entitlement programs. While some Democratic legislators express willingness to reform Medicare and Medicaid, they reject making Social Security reform part of the fiscal cliff negotiations, saying it is self-funded and therefore doesn\u2019t add to the deficit. A CNN/ORC International poll released Monday also showed that a solid majority of respondents \u2013 two thirds \u2013 supports the Democratic stance that any agreement should include a mix of spending cuts and tax increases. Of that total, Republicans favor such an approach by 52%-44%. Opinion: Don\u2019t be afraid of Grover Norquist Another poll on Wednesday by ABC News and the Washington Post showed a strong majority favoring the Obama tax proposal to raise tax rates on the wealthy. In addition, the survey indicated most Americans oppose raising the eligibility age of Medicare, one of the possible reforms proposed by some in the deficit debate.

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: President Barack Obama tells progressives, labor leaders he'll end tax cuts for wealthy \"one way or another\" Participant who was involved in last summer's debt ceiling talks says, \"The leverage is all on our side now\" Another person at the meeting had concerns about where entitlement program negotiations might go President Barack Obama on Tuesday delivered a \u201cstrong\u201d and \u201cdetermined\u201d defense of his intent to allow Bush-era tax cuts for wealthier Americans to expire while preserving cuts for middle-income earners, according to conversations with several people who attended a meeting between the president and labor and progressive leaders. The meeting at the White House \u2013 along with a second unannounced meeting with representatives from roughly a dozen groups focused on women\u2019s issues \u2013 was the start of a lengthy process of negotiating a resolution to the nation\u2019s impending budget crisis. Obama is scheduled to meet with business leaders on Wednesday and congressional leaders from both parties on Friday. Lasting roughly an hour, the meeting included representatives from four of the nation\u2019s largest labor unions as well as the heads of six independent groups involved in organizing grassroots support for progressive causes. \u201cThe president was very strong on saying there\u2019s going to be an end to the Bush tax cuts one way or another,\u201d said one participant who requested anonymity to discuss the off-the-record meeting. After disappointing many in the progressive community by failing to keep his promise to let the upper-income tax cuts expire during previous negotiations with Congress, the president seemed to convince many in Tuesday\u2019s meeting that this time would be different. \u201cI think that the president is going to play a real leadership role in this in finding a solution,\u201d said National Education Association president Dennis Van Roekel. \u201cI don\u2019t think President Obama is acting any different. I think he\u2019s in a very different place with those who oppose him. They don\u2019t have any leverage over him anymore.\u201d One participant in Tuesday\u2019s meeting who was also involved in last summer\u2019s debt ceiling negotiations agreed, \u201cThe leverage is all on our side now. I don\u2019t know why anyone watching this would think the president should negotiate at all [on tax cuts].\u201d Another participant described the president as \u201clocked and loaded in making sure this is a fair deal.\u201d AFL-CIO president Richard Trumka said that his organization and the others present on Tuesday plan to help the president keep his promise. \u201cThe president led with that notion of protecting the middle class,\u201d Trumka told reporters following the meeting, noting that Republicans have it in their power to negotiate a compromise that \u201cprotects\u201d the middle class. \u201cAre we going to push them on that? Without a doubt we\u2019re going to push them on that.\u201d Obama was slightly less convincing on his commitment to fight against any and all cuts to entitlement programs like Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security that are pillars of the progressive movement. Many in the meeting expressed confidence in the president\u2019s commitment to stand by promises he made to protect entitlement benefits during the campaign, but acknowledged that this process is just beginning. \u201cThe danger is not where the president is today. The danger for us is when the negotiations begin where they have to give,\u201d one participant said. \u201cThe first shots are just being fired.\u201d As the lone representative at Tuesday\u2019s meeting who was solely focused on protecting entitlement programs, Max Richtman from the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare said that the message he received was that entitlement cuts offered by the White House during previous rounds of negotiations were no longer on the table. \u201cI got the sense from this meeting that that was then and this is now,\u201d Richtman said. \u201cWe\u2019ve had an election. I think the president feels he\u2019s in a better position in terms of negotiating, and I got the clear sense that he\u2019s committed to protecting the beneficiaries of those programs as much as he could.\u201d During the meeting, Richtman argued that Social Security should be separated from any deficit negotiations because the program is in relatively good fiscal health. Richtman said he presented his argument to the president and that Obama agreed Social Security reform should be its own discussion. \u201cThe president agreed it should be dealt with on a separate track,\u201d Richtman said. \u201cDoes a separate track mean two weeks later? I don\u2019t know. But he accepted the premise that it was not part of the problem.\u201d Others in the meeting felt that the message on cuts to Medicare and Medicaid coming from the president and senior members of his economic team that attended the session wasn\u2019t quite so clear. \u201cThey were leaving the door open on what they would call healthcare savings, what we would call cuts to vital health care benefits,\u201d one participant said. \u201cI think that stuff could come on back if the Republicans were pushing on it, and that would be concerning to us.\u201d In separate statements on Friday, both Obama and House Speaker John Boehner struck a bipartisan tone. Speaking at the White House, the president said he was \u201copen to compromise,\u201d and would seek to \u201cbuild consensus\u201d at his meeting with congressional leaders, but he also signaled that compromising on his tax cut position wasn\u2019t an option. On Capitol Hill, Boehner sounded open to increasing revenue and said he didn\u2019t want to \u201cbox anybody else in\u201d by laying out too specific a plan before he spoke to the president. But he also spoke out against increased tax rates. Recently revealed details of an offer made by Obama to Boehner during negotiations last summer included some healthcare entitlement cuts that were unpalatable to progressives. While some in the meeting expressed fear that those cuts will resurface in order to ensure Republican support of the president\u2019s tax proposal, others argue that the playing field has fundamentally changed. \u201cI think at that time what he was exploring was how far are they were willing to go,\u201d NEA\u2019s Van Roekel said of the so-called \u2018grand bargain\u2019 negotiations between Obama and Boehner. \u201cIt\u2019s really quite amazing that they would just not do anything without extending the tax cuts for the top two percent. I think the people who were trying to make sure [Obama] wasn\u2019t reelected have lost their leverage and now their going to have to deal with the real issues.\u201d A somewhat more skeptical attendee of Tuesday\u2019s meeting agrees that circumstances have changed, but admitted there likely \u201cgoing to be some issues on the health care front where we\u2019ll disagree with him.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a very different bargaining environment now,\u201d he said. \u201cHe can either take advantage of that environment or not. The president sounded like a guy who has a mandate from the American people and he\u2019s going to fulfill it.\u201d",

            "article_content": "The president must deal with the \"fiscal cliff\" even before his next term begins Other issues at hand:  European economic crisis, Syria, Iran, Afghanistan Congress and Obama will have to work together to find solutions Even before he takes the oath of office for a second time, President Barack Obama has a crisis on his hands. On January 2, 2013, America will begin a long fall off the \u201cfiscal cliff\u201d \u2013 unless the White House and Congress can agree on a deal to avert the plunge. And that\u2019s not going to be easy. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be tough to govern\u201d with Congress still split and the Republican majority in the House intact, noted CNN political contributor David Gergen, who urged the president to heed the words of Winston Churchill: \u201cIn victory, magnanimity.\u201d Americans demand more from Obama\u2019s second term Gergen: Win shows desire for moderation 2 men, 2 speeches, 1 unifying message Gergen: Obama getting 'hurricane lift' Beyond the domestic agenda, the global economic slowdown threatens an anemic U.S. recovery \u2013 while Iran\u2019s nuclear program and Syria\u2019s implosion will also demand urgent attention after the rigors of the campaign trail. The in-tray may not seem as daunting as the one that greeted Obama on his first day in office in 2009, but he\u2019ll have little time to savor his latest victory. In fewer than 60 days, arbitrary spending cuts and tax increases will begin to kick in unless the president and Congress \u2013 half of which is still controlled by the Republicans \u2013 can find a better way to manage debt reduction. The challenge for Obama and the divided Congress is to come up with a credible consensus that tackles the deficit and doesn\u2019t smother the fragile roots of recovery. The Tax Policy Center estimates that allowing the Bush-era tax cuts to expire means an average tax increase of almost $2,000 for middle-class Americans.  Sucking that much money out of circulation could push unemployment above 9%, according to the Congressional Budget Office. Obama has declared that the estimated $109 billion worth of automatic budget cuts to defense spending, social services, education and other discretionary federal spending won\u2019t happen.  And White House officials \u2013 but not the president himself \u2013 say he will preserve the Bush-era tax cuts for the middle class but veto any bill that extends the cuts for households with incomes over $250,000. The expiration of those tax cuts would raise some $500 billion in revenues, according to the latest CBO data. If the United States doesn\u2019t address the impending fiscal cliff, ratings agency Moody\u2019s has warned of a further downgrading of U.S. sovereign debt. What is the fiscal cliff? Foreign governments are watching the situation with trepidation. Sustaining the U.S. recovery is vital to the health of the global economy \u2013 with most of Europe mired in recession, Japan facing its own version of the fiscal cliff \u2013 its public debt is twice the size of its $5 trillion economy \u2013 and growth in China slackening, though most countries would love to have its 7% expansion rate. World weighs in on Obama\u2019s win Deferring judgment day Now that the hyper-partisan presidential campaign is out of the way, there may be a window for compromise. But with Congress due to be in session for only 16 more days in 2012, that may extend only as far as a deal to kick the can down the road once more \u2013 resulting in a Band-Aid rather than a grand bargain. House Speaker John Boehner told CNN last weekend that was the most likely path. \u201cI think the best you can hope for is some kind of bridge,\u201d he said. Boehner and other Republicans have demanded spending cuts and other measures that would exceed any increase in the federal borrowing ceiling. Deferring the day of judgment is unlikely to impress the markets. Nor will another bout of protracted wrangling over raising the debt ceiling, something that will likely become necessary early in the new year. In September, Moody\u2019s indicated it would downgrade the U.S. sovereign rating from its \u201cAAA\u201d rating without \u201cspecific policies that produce a stabilization and then downward trend in the ratio of federal debt to GDP over the medium term.\u201d Standard & Poor\u2019s downgraded the U.S. rating in 2011 after the first bout over the debt ceiling. And as more baby boomers begin retiring and adding to the burden on Medicare and Social Security, it won\u2019t be long before entitlement programs come under even greater pressure. Meeting in Mexico over the weekend, G-20 finance ministers cited the U.S. fiscal cliff as the biggest risk to global growth. Canadian Finance Minister Jim Flaherty warned of \u201cdire consequences\u201d if it\u2019s not tackled. If the fiscal cliff is the most immediate problem, the consequences of a eurozone break-up could be equally as damaging. The G-20 ministers voiced concerns about the \u201ccomplex implementation\u201d of much-needed reforms. The potential for the events in Europe to add to the president\u2019s woes is probably underestimated because that situation seems interminable and impossible to unravel. It\u2019s only been a month since the International Monetary Fund warned of \u201ca downward spiral of capital flight, breakup fears and economic decline\u201d in Europe. Given that EU-U.S. trade was worth $636 billion in 2011 and U.S. investment in the EU was about $150 billion, Europe\u2019s economic health is hardly marginal to America. The European Union has averted imminent crisis by putting the European Central Bank on steroids, allowing it to use massive financial firepower to buy the bonds of troubled members. But Spain is not yet ready to accept bailout terms, Greece is already dangling off a fiscal cliff and several of Europe\u2019s largest economies are either in or on the edge of recession. Fiscal cliff looms Obama\u2019s foreign policy headaches While getting a deal on deficit reduction is the top domestic priority, Iran\u2019s nuclear program will likely be the president\u2019s main foreign policy headache. Obama has said repeatedly that Iran will not be allowed to obtain or build a nuclear weapon on his watch. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has a different threshold:  that Iran cannot be allowed to achieve the capability to build a bomb. As long as Iran continues to install centrifuges, expand its nuclear facilities and add to its stockpile of enriched uranium, that threshold comes closer to being met. Israel is as consumed with its own election campaign as the United States has been. For whoever takes office in January \u2013 and Netanyahu is favored to win \u2013 the Iran issue will again be front and center. Asked in an interview Monday whether he would \u201cpledge that Iran won\u2019t have a nuclear program\u201d by the end of his next term,  Netanyahu said, \u201cYes.\u201d Despite the lack of personal rapport between Obama and Netanyahu, Washington will try to restrain Israel in the hope that the damage inflicted by trade and financial sanctions against Iran will bring about a change of heart in Tehran. Netanyahu has said he won\u2019t be restrained by anyone if Israel\u2019s existence is threatened. \u201cWhen David Ben-Gurion declared the foundation of the state of Israel, was it done with American approval?\u201d he asked Monday. The United States will want to delay any military action for as long as possible, given the unpredictable consequences in a Middle East already torn by revolution and Islamist renaissance, and the fear that striking Iran\u2019s nuclear facilities might actually rally support for the regime rather than undermine it. Opinion: Where Obama, and America, go from here Sanctions \u2013 the favored weapon of the United States and European Union \u2013 have curbed Iranian oil exports and other trade, causing a dramatic devaluation in the Iranian rial.  High inflation and growing hardship, so the argument goes, will eventually force the Iranian leadership to come to the table for productive talks on its nuclear program. Several rounds of multilateral talks this year made no headway, giving some credence to Romney\u2019s jibe that Iran is four years closer to a nuclear weapon than when Obama took office. But with the election over, another stab at dialogue is possible without exposing the president to accusations that he\u2019s soft on the ayatollahs. With Russia adamantly opposed to stiffer United Nations sanctions and a new leadership in China, building an international consensus on Iran will be difficult. On the other hand, Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad is weakened as a political force as his second and final term draws to a close. Cliff Kupchan of the Eurasia Group says that unlike in 2009, when a possible deal was sabotaged by regime bickering, Iran\u2019s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei \u201cis probably strong enough to make a deal stick should he so choose. But a recalcitrant and bucking Ahmadinejad would make that outcome more difficult.\u201d For the White House \u2013 a delicate balancing act will demand a close reading of Iran\u2019s and Israel\u2019s intentions. But Iran is not the only overseas crisis that needs urgent attention. With every passing week, the revolt in Syria becomes more difficult to influence and more likely to spill into neighboring states. Some analysts expect a more muscular U.S. approach now that the election is out of the way \u2013 one that might include setting up a zone in northwest Syria that is beyond the reach of President Bashar al-Assad\u2019s rule.  Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has already foreshadowed a change in approach \u2013 saying the United States will engage more with the country\u2019s internal opposition and less with the exiled and largely ineffectual Syrian National Council (SNC), which is Turkey\u2019s preferred representative. \u201cThere has to be a representation of those who are on the front lines, fighting and dying today to obtain their freedom,\u201d Clinton said October 31. On another front, managing the military drawdown in Afghanistan \u2013 something that was rarely discussed in the presidential election campaign \u2013 will be another challenge. Afghan security forces have been stood up; they are more numerous and more capable than four years ago. But two years before the scheduled withdrawal of all U.S. combat troops, the Kabul government looks fragile and the Taliban undaunted. Critics have voiced concerns that the publicly announced withdrawal date only lets the Taliban know how long it must hold out before it can make another bid for resurgence. Efforts to wean the \u201cgood\u201d Taliban off the battlefield and into negotiations has so far gone nowhere.  For Obama, whose first campaign stressed winning the war in Afghanistan and getting out of Iraq, the collapse of a government supported by so many billions of U.S. taxpayer dollars would be a humiliating reverse. Last month, the International Crisis Group said the outlook was far from assuring. \u201cDemonstrating at least will to ensure clean elections (in Afghanistan in 2014) could forge a degree of national consensus and boost popular confidence, but steps toward a stable transition must begin now to prevent a precipitous slide toward state collapse. Time is running out,\u201d the group said. Obama faces a world of challenges in second term Different problems, same solution Whether it\u2019s Syria, Iran or the fiscal cliff, Obama must use the same principles to find a solution:  develop a dialogue, find common ground, exploit opportunities and occasionally employ a well-calibrated threat. That\u2019s what happened in 1997, when the Clinton administration reached a deal with the Republican congressional leadership to reduce the federal deficit and achieve a balanced budget in five years. The deal cut spending, and it cut taxes by $91 billion over five years \u2013 while allowing the debt ceiling to rise to $5.95 trillion. \u201cWe have come to an agreement that will lead us to less Washington spending, to tax relief for working Americans, to security for our senior citizens, and less dependency on government, more responsibility, and opportunity for individuals, communities, and states,\u201d said former Sen. Trent Lott, then the Republican leader in the Senate. Ahhh, the good old days. Now the statutory debt ceiling is at $16.4 trillion, with no sign of a deal on taxes or spending. Obama makes history, again",

            "article_content": "NEW: House Speaker John Boehner challenges Barack Obama on tax and entitlement reforms NEW: Obama talks by phone with congressional leaders on moving forward With re-election, Obama free from having to face voters again; will that lead to compromise? Bill Clinton had said an Obama win could be key to ending the Washington logjam President Barack Obama returned to Washington on Wednesday and plunged into a newly energized political debate over how to shrink the chronic federal deficit and debt in the wake of his stronger-than-expected re-election victory. Tuesday\u2019s election results effectively preserved the political status quo, with Obama winning a second term and Republicans holding their majority in the U.S. House while Democrats keeping control of the Senate. The looming question was whether freedom from having to face the voters again would prompt Obama to push harder for a compromise that might anger core liberal supporters. At the same time, Republicans stung by their defeat in the presidential race and their inability to seize the Senate faced pressure from inside and outside the party to soften their fierce partisanship and adopt more moderate positions that might bring about agreement on tough issues. Obama makes history again The nation faces a \u201cfiscal cliff\u201d  \u2013 a combination of expiring tax cuts and required, across-the-board spending reductions set to occur at the end of the year absent a congressional deal to avert it. Economists warn that allowing the full impact of the fiscal cliff to occur would further slow an already sluggish recovery, while failure to address the deficit issue in a comprehensive way could bring another downgrade of the U.S. credit rating. See the president's full victory speech Obama speaks on love of wife, kids World weighs in on Obama victory Road to Obama's victory in 3 minutes Posturing by both sides on Wednesday professed a conciliatory approach but offered little movement from hardline positions that have stymied past negotiations on a broad deficit reduction deal. A White House statement said Obama launched the discussion on arguably the most pressing challenge facing his administration by phoning key congressional leaders Wednesday, including the top Republican in both the House and Senate. Obama \u201creiterated his commitment to finding bipartisan solutions to: reduce our deficit in a balanced way, cut taxes for middle class families and small businesses and create jobs,\u201d the statement said. World worries as U.S. fiscal cliff looms \u201cThe president said he believed that the American people sent a message in yesterday\u2019s election that leaders in both parties need to put aside their partisan interests and work with common purpose to put the interests of the American people and the American economy first,\u201d it continued. One of those who spoke with the president, House Speaker John Boehner, issued his own statement later Wednesday. In it, he challenged Obama to work with Republicans on negotiating a comprehensive plan to reduce spending, lower tax rates while eliminating tax loopholes, and reform entitlement programs such as Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid. \u201cWe want you to lead, not as a liberal or a conservative, but as president of the United States of America,\u201d said Boehner, R-Ohio. \u201cWe want you to succeed.  Let\u2019s challenge ourselves to find the common ground that has eluded us. Let\u2019s rise above the dysfunction and do the right thing together for our country.\u201d However, Boehner specifically opposed a core Obama tax proposal that was a major theme of his election campaign \u2013 restoring higher tax rates from the 1990s on individuals who make more than $250,000. The conservative Boehner also made clear that Obama and the nation should drop any thought of reaching a comprehensive agreement in coming weeks, and he called instead for laying the foundation for difficult but necessary negotiations next year when the new Congress starts work. \u201cWe won\u2019t solve the problem of our fiscal unbalance overnight and certainly won\u2019t do it in a lame duck session of Congress,\u201d Boehner said. \u201cAnd it won\u2019t be solved simply by raising taxes or taking a plunge off the fiscal cliff.\u201d Opinion: Five things Obama must do Obama\u2019s election victory in a campaign based in part on his call for wealthy Americans to contribute more to reduce the federal deficit gives him a negotiating advantage over Boehner, analysts said. Boehner was \u201ctrying to do the best he can with a very weak hand,\u201d said CNN contributor Reihan Salam. Conservatives seek to shrink the size of government and therefore oppose additional revenue from taxes. Boehner tried to sound willing to compromise on Wednesday by saying he\u2019d be open to a comprehensive plan resulting in more revenue, but not from higher taxes. He offered a similar proposal to vanquished Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney, who argued during the campaign for tax reform that lowered rates for everyone and eliminated some loopholes and deductions to promote economic growth that mean more government revenue. Meanwhile, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, said Wednesday that the election results showed that most Americans want the wealthy to pay a larger share toward resolving the nation\u2019s fiscal problems. \u201cIt is better to dance than to fight. It is better to work together,\u201d Reid told a news conference. \u201cEverything doesn\u2019t have to be a fight. That is the way it\u2019s been the last couple of years. Everyone should comprehend, especially my Senate friends, that legislation is the art of compromise. It is consensus building.\u201d Analysis: Obama won with a better ground game On Tuesday night, Obama told euphoric supporters in Chicago that \u201cyou voted for action, not politics as usual.\u201d Romney, absorbing defeat after a historically expensive race on both sides, issued a similar call in his concession speech. \u201cThe nation, as you know, is at a critical point,\u201d he said. \u201cAt a time like this, we can\u2019t risk partisan bickering and political posturing.  Our leaders have to reach across the aisle to do the people\u2019s work.\u201d Former President Bill Clinton predicted weeks ago that an Obama victory would be the key to ending the gridlock in Washington. Every administration needs \u201can action-forcing event,\u201d he told CNN, adding: \u201cI believe the election will be that event. I expect the president to win. And I think if he does, after this happens, then you will see the logjam begin to break.\u201d Republican strategist Ana Navarro, a CNN contributor, echoed that message Wednesday. \u201cPresident Obama\u2019s re-election does two things. It frees President Obama to be able to work with the Republican Congress, and it frees the Republican Congress to be able to work with President Obama,\u201d Navarro said. Philadelphia Mayor Michael Nutter summed it up succinctly. \u201cThe election is over.  It\u2019s time for governing and making things happen,\u201d he told CNN. That means bringing Obama\u2019s signature campaign word \u2013 \u201cforward\u201d \u2013 to fruition. \u201cTonight, more than 200 years after a former colony won the right to determine its own destiny,\u201d the president said in his victory speech early Wednesday, \u201cthe task of perfecting our union moves forward.\u201d How Obama\u2019s data crunchers helped him win",

            "article_content": "Pennsylvania was once considered safely in the column of Obama, who won there handily in 2008 Both Romney and Ryan are campaigning in the state in the campaign's final days Romney campaign and super PACs outspending Obama and allies on ads by 2-1 margin Obama campaign calls GOP efforts to take the state \"desperate hunt\" for electoral votes \u201cHey, Pennsylvania, you going to help us win this election?\u201d That question from Republican running mate Paul Ryan on Saturday was met with very loud applause from the crowd at a rally he headlined at the airport in the Keystone State\u2019s capital. Ryan\u2019s boss, GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney, holds a rally Sunday in Bucks County in suburban Philadelphia, the key swing region of the state, which has been considered safely in President Barack Obama\u2019s hands. After being far from the spotlight for most of the general election campaign, Pennsylvania \u2013 and its 20 electoral votes \u2013 is getting a lot of last-minute attention. Do the math: CNN Electoral College calculator Turn on the TV during local newscasts and the commercial breaks are flooded with campaign ads. \u201cTwenty-three million looking for full time work. Middle class incomes falling,\u201d says the narrator in a commercial by the pro-Romney super PAC Restore Our Future that\u2019s running on broadcast TV in Pennsylvania. Nearly $10 million is being spent to run spots over the final nine days leading up to Election Day, with the Romney campaign and its allied super PACs outspending Obama\u2019s campaign and pro-Obama groups by around a 2-1 margin. Rahm Emanuel: 'It's a close election' Giuliani criticizes Obama on Sandy Barbour: Sandy broke Romney's momentum But the Obama campaign isn\u2019t sitting back. Jill Biden, the wife of the Pennsylvania-born vice president, campaigned in the Keystone State this weekend, and the Obama campaign\u2019s big gun, former President Bill Clinton, is scheduled to stump for Obama in Pennsylvania on Monday. Then-Vice President George H.W. Bush\u2019s 1988 victory in the state was the last time a Republican carried Pennsylvania in a presidential election. But the state remained competitive in the following presidential cycles, until four years ago, when Obama carried Pennsylvania by 10 points over Sen. John McCain. But two years ago, the GOP enjoyed a strong showing in the midterm elections, winning back the governor\u2019s office, a Senate seat and five House seats from the Democrats. The state has seen little of the presidential tickets in this cycle. But last month the polls started tightening, as the president\u2019s once-solid lead shrank to a single-digit advantage. A Franklin and Marshall College poll released last Wednesday indicated Obama with a 49%-45% edge over Romney, which is within the survey\u2019s sampling error and was down from the nine-point lead he had in September. \u201cCan I just tell you how red Pennsylvania\u2019s going to be on Tuesday,\u201d said Republican Sen. Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania at the Ryan rally to applause. \u201cBecause I know how red it\u2019s going to be \u2013 this red, okay,\u201d he said as he pointed to the red jacket he was wearing. \u201cThis is the color of Pennsylvania on Tuesday.\u201d The Romney campaign sees the late push in Pennsylvania as a plan to expand its electoral map. \u201cWe feel like they\u2019re defending territory while we\u2019re on offense,\u201d Romney campaign spokesman Kevin Madden told reporters last week. And since Pennsylvania escaped the deluge of campaign ads over the late spring, summer and early autumn, it wasn\u2019t exposed to the many Obama commercials that sought to negatively define the GOP nominee and the Romney campaign might have a better chance of changing minds in Pennsylvania than in some of the battleground states that saw those ads. The Obama campaign shoots back at talk that Pennsylvania might actually be in play. \u201cYou see the Romney campaign and their allies heading into three states they are simply not going to win: Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Minnesota. I am so confident of that, that I\u2019ve put my mustache on the line,\u201d senior Obama campaign adviser David Axelrod told reporters last week. Rival campaign advisers talk battlegrounds And the Obama campaign describes the late push by Romney into Pennsylvania as a sign of desperation. \u201cMitt Romney sent Congressman Ryan to Pennsylvania today on a desperate hunt for a path to 270 electoral votes. That\u2019s because the states that have actually heard from Romney and Ryan throughout this campaign aren\u2019t buying what they\u2019re selling,\u201d Obama spokesman Danny Kanner said Saturday. Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, Obama\u2019s first White House chief of staff, says that the campaign stops by Jill Biden and Clinton in the Keystone State are not a sign that Pennsylvania is in play. \u201cIt\u2019s a close election. B, you nail everything down. And C, I think Pennsylvania is secure, but you don\u2019t take anything for granted. And that means you \u2013 there are going to be a lot of people going back to Ohio in the 96 hours, multiple times. They\u2019ll go to Pennsylvania,\u201d Emanuel told CNN Chief Political Correspondent Candy Crowley on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union.\u201d \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t mean that it\u2019s slipping. It just means that the natural tiding of a race. But the president\u2019s in a strong position because of the policies,\u201d added Emanuel. McCain made an unsuccessful late push into Pennsylvania four years ago. We\u2019ll find out on Tuesday if Romney\u2019s late push is more successful.",

            "article_content": "NEW: A new CNN/ORC poll shows Obama maintains a slight edge in Ohio NEW: Former President Bill Clinton to campaign in Pennsylvania The campaigns provide differing spin on the October employment numbers Obama cites \"real progress\"; Mitt Romney says he offers real change Launching their final campaign bursts in a close and contentious race, President Barack Obama and Republican challenger Mitt Romney argued Friday over who will bring real change to a nation still mired in a sluggish economy. With four days until the Tuesday election, a stronger-than-expected October jobs report evoked a typically divided reaction from the candidates competing for every last vote in the handful of battleground states considered still up for grabs. The last government unemployment figures before Election Day showed more of the incremental economic growth that Obama heralds as continued recovery and Romney labels insufficient. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the economy added 171,000 jobs last month and the unemployment rate rose to 7.9%, up from 7.8% in September after being above 8% since February 2009 \u2013 the month after Obama took office. How could jobs report affect election? Jobs big issue for Las Vegas voters Swing state jobless could shape election Last jobs report before election crucial in close race At three rallies in Ohio, one of the most crucial swing states, Obama made a brief reference to the report in telling boisterous crowds that \u201cwe learned companies hired more workers in October than at any time in the last eight months.\u201d He then quickly shifted his campaign stump speech each time, citing a revived American auto industry, rising home values and increased highway construction \u2013 all important economic issues in Ohio \u2013 as evidence of recovery during his presidency. \u201cWe have made real progress,\u201d Obama said, adding that \u201cwe are here today because we know we\u2019ve got more work to do.\u201d The White House noted the jobs report showed growth for a 32nd straight month to further bolster recovery from the recession inherited by Obama. \u201cWhile more work remains to be done, today\u2019s employment report provides further evidence that the U.S. economy is continuing to heal from the wounds inflicted by the worst downturn since the Great Depression,\u201d said a statement by Alan Krueger, who chairs Obama\u2019s Council of Economic Advisers. To Romney, the increase in the unemployment rate was \u201ca sad reminder that the economy is at a virtual standstill.\u201d \u201cUnemployment today is higher than when Barack Obama took office,\u201d Romney told a campaign event in Wisconsin. In a statement released by his campaign, Romney said Obama\u2019s policies have \u201ccrushed America\u2019s middle class\u201d for four years, and that the president\u2019s claims of progress ring hollow with people struggling to get by. House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, piled on in saying that \u201cfour years of persistently high unemployment and long-term joblessness might be the best President Obama can do \u2013 but it\u2019s nowhere near what the American people can do if we get Washington out of their way.\u201d Final jobs report before election gives ammo for both sides Blaming what he called failed Obama policies including stimulus-style spending, excessive regulations and the threat of tax hikes by the president, Boehner said the result was \u201can economy that\u2019s far weaker than it should be.\u201d The October figures show that for the first time, the U.S. economy has more jobs than it did when Obama took office. The actual figure is 194,000 more jobs today than in January 2009, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics data, and expected revisions could make the number larger. U.S. stocks initially opened higher on the jobs data before turning lower as the day wore on. The data on new hiring also complimented other economic reports this week showing gains in manufacturing, consumer confidence and auto sales. Sheila Bair, a former head of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, told CNN the employment report would have a minimal impact on Election Day because the numbers already play into the campaigns\u2019 economic narratives. Voters consistently cite the economy as the top election issue this year, and Romney and Republicans have focused their campaign efforts on framing the vote as a referendum on Obama\u2019s presidency. The unemployment rate was 7.8% when Obama was sworn in on January 20, 2009, and climbed above 8% the next month before dropping to 7.8% again more than three years later, in September. Obama and his campaign often note that the economy was losing well over 500,000 jobs a month when he took office, and that his policies have reversed that trend to bring uninterrupted, though slower-than-needed growth. Krueger\u2019s statement Friday said that over the past 12 months, the economy added more than two million jobs compared to 1.9 million in the previous year. However, Romney and Republicans say a lack of leadership has prevented a more robust recovery. \u201cFour years ago, candidate Obama promised to do so very much, but he has fallen so very short,\u201d Romney said in a campaign speech in Wisconsin. \u201cWords are cheap. A record is real and it\u2019s earned with real effort. Real change is not measured in words. Real change is measured in achievements.\u201d The question of the election, Romney said, \u201ccomes down to this: Do you want more of the same or do you want real change?\u201d Romney\u2019s vision for America He also accused Obama of failing to work with congressional Republicans and warned of further dysfunction in Washington, saying \u201cthe debt ceiling will come up again and shut down and default will be threatened, chilling the economy.\u201d Democrats blame GOP intransigence, led by a conservative wing of tea party favorites, for congressional stalemate. A possible comprehensive agreement on deficit reduction stalled over the refusal of both sides to yield on the issue of tax increases, with Democrats calling for a return to higher rates of the 1990s on income over $250,000 while Republicans rejected any kind of rise. In his Ohio remarks, Obama challenged Romney\u2019s argument, saying his Republican rival offered only a repeat of tax cuts and shrinking government that he blamed for contributing to the recession and financial collapse during the Bush administration. Obama\u2019s vision for America Obama also leveled a harsh attack on a Romney ad earlier this week that incorrectly implied Jeep would shift manufacturing from the United States to China. The issue resonates in Ohio, one of the most important battleground states still up for grabs, because of its major auto industry. The auto industry bailout that Obama championed gives him the advantage on the topic over Romney, who called at the time for letting the automakers go bankrupt and then managing their reform. Obama said the Romney ad caused worried autoworkers to wonder if their jobs were being shipped overseas. \u201cIt\u2019s not true. The car companies themselves have told Gov. Romney to knock it off,\u201d Obama said, adding that he understood Romney had a tough time in Ohio because he opposed the auto bailout and is \u201con videotape saying \u2018Let Detroit go bankrupt.\u2019 \u201c About the ad, Obama said: \u201cYou don\u2019t scare people just to scare up some votes.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s not leadership,\u201d he continued. \u201cWhen I made the decision to rescue the auto industry, I knew it wasn\u2019t popular. It wasn\u2019t even popular in Ohio. But I knew it was the right thing to do. Betting on workers was right thing to do.\u201d A new CNN/ORC International poll released Friday showed Obama maintaining a narrow edge over Romney, 50%-47%, in Ohio. The result is within the survey\u2019s margin of error and is similar to polling in the state over the past month. Both campaigns are focusing their final push on the handful of battleground states that are vital to their chances. In addition, Romney and running mate Rep. Paul Ryan are heading to Pennsylvania, which was considered to be leaning Democratic but has seen tightening in the polls in recent weeks. The Obama campaign calls the Romney focus on Pennsylvania a futile effort to win a state that has supported Democratic candidates in the last five presidential elections. However, it announced Friday that former President Bill Clinton, a top surrogate for Obama, will campaign in Pennsylvania on Monday.

            "article_content": "The monthly jobs report is the last one before next week's presidential election It may be the single most motivating event at this point in the campaign Americans are generally partisan and split when evaluating which candidate will create more jobs But they believe propelling America forward fundamentally means jobs creation The monthly jobs report \u2013 the last before the nail-biting election next week \u2013 may be the single most motivating event to take place at this point in the campaign. On its own, it wouldn\u2019t be. But with a race so tight in so many swing states, swayable, uncommitted, undecided and even decided voters could be persuaded to cast a ballot for the presidential candidate they think can best propel the country forward. And propelling America forward fundamentally means job creation. Here are five things you need to know about the U.S. employment situation report for October released Friday. CNN Money: Hiring increases in October, unemployment up 1. It\u2019s a trend, not a bombshell Both the confusing and less-relevant, though politically more popular, \u201cunemployment rate,\u201d and the more important number of jobs created, have been trending in the right direction.  There\u2019s nothing in today\u2019s number that fundamentally changes the fact that we\u2019re moving more slowly than was predicted and more slowly than we\u2019d like to be moving. It is to President Obama\u2019s advantage if you subscribe to trend and Mitt Romney\u2019s if you think it is too slow.  But it is pointing the right way. Romney\u2019s vision for America Obama argues that he\u2019s more than made up for the number of jobs lost since he inherited the crisis. Romney underscores that it\u2019s not the quantity, but the quality of those jobs, which have been lower-paying and have offered fewer benefits than those lost. Obama\u2019s vision for America 2. Neither candidate has a real plan Polling continues to show that Americans are generally partisan and split when evaluating which candidate will create more jobs.  That\u2019s because neither has a plan (though both have dreams and aspirations), and most people realize that the president has limited ability to motivate the large-scale creation of jobs in the private sector, which is where it needs to happen. Final jobs report before election gives ammo for both sides 3. They\u2019re both making promises they have no way of guaranteeing they\u2019ll keep Romney made a ridiculous pledge to create 12 million jobs in four years; a cynical ploy to play on Americans\u2019 most base economic fear. Obama matched the pledge, though, unlike Romney, doesn\u2019t bring it up nearly as often.  Advisers to both campaigns have conceded to me under extensive questioning that this is more of an aspiration or a goal than an achievable promise.  That\u2019s not how the candidates presented it.  They have been dishonest. Fastest-growing jobs 4. Both plans are based on an average of 4% economic growth over the next term We\u2019re at 2% now. 3% next year if we\u2019re lucky (see below).  4% is something virtually no economists say is likely.  Romney pegs it all on tax cuts, and points to Ronald Reagan.  But tax cuts under Reagan were, as a percentage, much greater than anything we can afford to do today. Romney\u2019s math doesn\u2019t come close to adding up \u2013 it\u2019s all about the GDP growth number. But if it\u2019s all about GDP growth, then the president doesn\u2019t matter.  I could be president with 4% GDP growth and create 12 million jobs in four years, which is 3 million/year, or 250,000 a month.  It\u2019s 50% higher than the best current projections.  Obama, for his part, does have a better plan, based largely on the hidden \u201cinfrastructure bank\u201d in his Jobs Act, which never got passed.  But I talk about that more than he ever did. He\u2019s afraid of the best part of his plan for some reason. 5. Europe\u2019s the problem, not China Europe\u2019s getting worse, not better. It\u2019s like a head cold; even once you start treating it, it still has to run its course and will get worse before it gets better.  That hurts the U.S. \u2013 and its need to achieve an average of 4% economic growth over the next four years.  And we were all betting on a growing middle class in China, which would buy anything American-made that wasn\u2019t nailed down. But what Europe isn\u2019t buying, China isn\u2019t making. And while China\u2019s making less and less, its population is prospering more slowly.  While the United States can have some limited impact on China\u2019s economic behavior, it has virtually no influence over the European mess, which is why you don\u2019t hear about it on the campaign trail.  In the short term, Europe is America\u2019s real problem, not China. Best jobs in America",

            "article_content": "Romney and running mate Paul Ryan to campaign in Pennsylvania President Barack Obama and Mitt Romney target battleground states in final days The focus is on turning out the vote and persuading the dwindling undecideds The campaigns compete with speeches and ads in states still up for grabs After years of planning and months of campaigning, the most expensive presidential race in history comes down to a final five-day whirlwind of speeches and television ads in the eight states still up for grabs. President Barack Obama and Republican challenger Mitt Romney plan to hold virtually nonstop events between now and the Tuesday election considered too close to call. The focus is on battleground states worth 95 of the 270 electoral votes needed to win. Both sides are trying to close the deal with a dwindling number of uncommitted voters, while making sure supporters actually cast ballots. That means a game of campaign chess that started Thursday, with appearances by the candidates and their surrogates as well as advertising dollars allocated to the places considered most vital to success. Obama: Romney betting on cynicism Romney decries 'shrinking' administration Battle for Ohio goes door to door Concluding a race expected to cost more than $6 billion overall, Obama and Romney and their running mates will hit all the battleground states \u2013 Colorado, Florida, Iowa, Ohio, New Hampshire, Nevada, Virginia and Wisconsin. The campaigns also are unloading a blast of television ads and mailings that threaten to overwhelm voters already saturated with politicking. Obama, Romney paths to victory cross in Iowa Perhaps no one said it better than 4-year-old Abigael Evans of Fort Collins, Colorado, who \u2013 according to NPR \u2013 cried after listening to more election coverage on the radio and told her mother: \u201cI\u2019m tired of Broncobama and Mitt Romney.\u201d In a sign of the strategic maneuvering at hand, Romney surrogates and super-PACs supporting him are targeting two states considered likely to go for Obama \u2013 Michigan and Pennsylvania. On Thursday, Romney\u2019 s campaign announced he will visit Pennsylvania on Sunday, a major commitment that signaled it believes he can win the Keystone State. His running mate, Rep. Paul Ryan, will campaign in Pennsylvania on Saturday. According to Romney\u2019s team, both Pennsylvania and Michigan are in play due to what it calls a surge of momentum that emerged after the first presidential debate on October 3, which analysts and polls scored a solid victory for the former Massachusetts governor over a lackluster Obama. In response, the president\u2019s campaign pointed to his lead in polls in both states and argued the money and time spent in them by the Romney campaign amounts to a bluff to try to depict nonexistent momentum. Republican candidates claiming late momentum made a final push in Pennsylvania in the last five elections, and lost the state every time, according to the Obama team. At the same time, Obama\u2019s camp and supporting groups have devoted some new attention to both Pennsylvania and Michigan, which are crucial to the president\u2019s strategy for nailing down the electoral advantage. In an example of the advertising battle, a Romney campaign ad broadcast this week in Florida seeks to link Obama to Venezuela\u2019s Hugo Chavez and Cuba\u2019s Fidel Castro \u2013 leftist leaders reviled by much of the state\u2019s Cuban American population. The ad spotlights endorsements from Chavez and Mariela Castro, the niece of Fidel, who both said they would vote for Obama if they could. While non-Cuban Latinos overwhelmingly support Obama, according to polls, Romney and Republicans hold an advantage among more conservative Cuban-Americans. Another Romney ad released Thursday attacked Obama\u2019s suggestion in an interview with MSNBC that he would consider consolidating government agencies under a new \u201csecretary of business\u201d in a second term. The ad portrayed the comment as more big government, saying Obama\u2019s \u201csolution to everything is to add another bureaucrat.\u201d Romney echoed the ad in his first stop Thursday in Virginia, ending a temporary cease-fire in direct political attacks this week due to Superstorm Sandy by saying, \u201cwe don\u2019t need a secretary of business to understand business, we need a president who understands business and I do, and that\u2019s why I\u2019ll be able to get this economy going.\u201d In America: Parallels to country\u2019s racist past haunt age of Obama The Obama campaign, meanwhile, released new television and radio ads that featured the endorsement for the president by former Secretary of State Colin Powell, a Republican. The ads to run in the battleground states, as well as North Carolina, include Powell supporting achievements of Obama\u2019s first term. Another Obama ad took aim at an earlier Romney spot that implied Chrysler was shifting Jeep manufacturing from the United States to China, a claim denied by the automaker. The Obama campaign said the ad will run in Michigan and Ohio, two big auto industry states. Both candidates sought to balance their campaign stump speeches between longstanding criticism of each other with positive messaging meant to inspire voters to choose them. The challenge is to pick up any remaining undecided voters while motivating all bona fide supporters to either cast votes early or head to the polls on Tuesday. For Obama, that means overcoming disappointment with continuing high unemployment and sluggish economic recovery during his presidency. \u201cThese are the last five days of his last campaign \u2013 ever,\u201d noted Obama campaign spokeswoman Jennifer Psaki. \u201cSo you will hear many of the themes, much about the fight that he\u2019s been waging throughout his \u2026 career in public life on behalf of the middle class.\u201d At his first stop Thursday in Green Bay, Wisconsin, the president told a cheering crowd on the airport tarmac that Romney is trying to sell failed Republican policies that helped cause the financial collapse of 2008 as forward progress. \u201cHe is saying he is the candidate of change,\u201d Obama said. \u201cWell, let me tell you Wisconsin \u2013 we know what change looks like and what the governor is offering sure ain\u2019t change.\u201d Pointing to his own record of health care reform, Wall Street reform and other steps he said were intended to strengthen the middle class, the president told his supporters they know real change when they see it. Romney and Republicans were counting on the American people to be \u201cso worn down by all the squabbling, so tired of all the dysfunction that you will actually reward obstruction and put people back in charge who advocate the very policies that got us into this mess,\u201d Obama said. \u201cIn other words, their bet is on cynicism,\u201d he added. \u201cBut Wisconsin my bet is on you.  My bet is on the decency and good sense of the American people because despite all the resistance, despite all the setbacks, we have won some great fights.\u201d Maria Cardona, a Democratic strategist and CNN contributor, said she expected similar attacks on Romney in the final days of the race. Poll shows Obama edge in Iowa, New Hampshire and Wisconsin Referring to the Republican challenger, Cardona said \u201cthe dissonance between what he is saying now, what he has said in the past, and what his policies will actually do is something that voters are going to continue to hear about from the Obama campaign and their surrogates, as they should.\u201d Vice President Joe Biden followed that script Thursday, telling an Iowa crowd that Obama \u201csays what he means and he means what he says, and no one can say that about Gov. Romney.\u201d Earlier, Romney told cheering, sign-waving supporters in Roanoke, Virginia, that Obama\u2019s policies have failed to bring the kind of economic growth the nation should be experiencing, asking if people wanted \u201cfour more years like the last four years\u201d with high unemployment, trillion-dollar deficits and political gridlock in Washington. \u201cI know that the Obama folks are chanting four more years, four more years. But our chant is this \u2013 five more days,\u201d he said. He also accused the Obama campaign of \u201cshrinking to smaller things\u201d through personal attacks against him. His speech included now familiar references to offering a new direction for the country in what has been a more positive and personal touch for a candidate considered aloof and wooden during the Republican primaries. \u201cIt\u2019s exactly what he needs to do these last few days of the campaign \u2013 get his base enthused, get them out to work,\u201d said Ana Navarro, a Republican strategist and CNN contributor. \u201cIt\u2019s all about the ground game right now.\u201d While Romney has been unable to overtake Obama so far in most swing state polls, some of the polling data suggests the president could be vulnerable. For example, an NBCNews/Wall Street Journal/Marist poll released Thursday showed voters under 30 in New Hampshire \u2013 an important demographic for the president \u2013 were less enthusiastic about the election than older demographics that tend to be more supportive of Romney. Obama needs to repeat his strong support in 2008 from young voters as well as minority voters \u2013 especially Latinos and African-Americans \u2013 to win on Tuesday, and that means making sure the turnout on Election Day is as large as possible. Compounding the turnout issue are logistical problems along the East Coast due to the devastation by Sandy, and expected legal issues including tightened voter eligibility standards in some states that Democrats complain were intended to suppress the minority vote.

King: Americans pick presidents on Election Day, not vice presidents That doesn't mean the Biden, Ryan debate doesn't matter, he says Both sides hope for a win to give their campaign momentum, King says Yes, the debate between Joe Biden and Paul Ryan is sure to be entertaining, and it comes at an important moment in a highly competitive presidential campaign. But let\u2019s not get carried away. Some healthy context, courtesy of Republican pollster Whit Ayres: \u201cDan Quayle got his clock cleaned in his VP debate and still ended up as vice president.\u201d That\u2019s because Americans pick presidents on Election Day, not vice presidents. Will nervous tics and trips of the tongue fell veep candidates? Photos: From the campaign trail Debating Paul Ryan 'Dead Fred' takes seat at VP debate Pressure on Biden and Ryan in debate For all the hype, there is scant evidence of a game-changing vice presidential debate in our political history and plenty of reason to believe there is but one overriding challenge. \u201cThe key for both VP candidates is to come across as competent potential presidents,\u201d said Ayres. \u201cIf they pass that test, then they have done their jobs.\u201d Still, given the moment, even Ayres concedes Thursday night\u2019s showdown does matter some. \u201cA great performance by Ryan will keep Republican momentum going and will help his post-2012 political career,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s not likely to have a large impact on the presidential race one way or another.\u201d That view \u2013 the belief any impact will be limited \u2013 is in part based on the history of debates, and in part on the timing of this one: President Obama and Mitt Romney stage their second debate just a few days after their running mates get their one debate spotlight. So, the men atop the ticket will yield the stage only briefly. Still, both sides have clear goals for the Biden-Ryan face-off. CNN exclusive: How Ryan sharpens debate skills \u201cOur sense is it matters a lot, and that it is an opportunity,\u201d said a top Romney adviser who spoke to CNN only on condition of anonymity because the campaign\u2019s public line is to play down expectations. This Romney adviser played up the generational contrast, suggesting voters in Ryan\u2019s demographic \u2013 30 years old to 50 years old \u2013 voice \u201cthe brunt of the economic angst\u201d over the job market, housing prices and America\u2019s competitive standing in the global economy. \u201cRyan knows this story really well,\u201d the Romney adviser said. \u201cHe is our generational argument up against Biden\u2019s experience and age. Ryan should play well in this key demographic, and he knows how to have this conversation.\u201d Democrats, though, see an opportunity to make political gains by highlighting controversial aspects of the budget plan Ryan wrote for House Republicans. \u201cThere are still a lot of questions about how Romney would integrate Ryan\u2019s budget plan,\u201d said Democratic pollster Margie Omero. \u201cThere is no greater way to illustrate the difference between the two camps on fighting for the middle class than with a debate between Ryan and Biden.\u201d Share your questions for the candidates Omero\u2019s big question: \u201cHow will Ryan talk about his proposed cuts to the safety net?\u201d  She also wonders what will happen \u201cif Ryan gets testy\u201d defending his plan, voicing Democratic hopes that Biden can put his GOP opponent back on his heels. Democratic hopes for an aggressive Biden performance are amplified because of the at times lackluster showing  Obama turned in during his first showdown with Romney. Even Obama allies concede the president was hardly at his best, and that he left several potential openings on the table. If nothing else, what Democrats want most from Biden is a morale boost. Republican morale is on an upswing at the moment and they hope for a strong Ryan showing to keep their spirits high heading into the far more important Obama-Romney debates. A top Romney campaign aide framed it this way when asked how much the VP debate mattered: \u201cA little,\u201d this aide said. \u201cIt can continue our momentum and the Obama slide, or it can settle the waters.\u201d Five things to watch for in the vice presidential debate What questions would you ask the VP candidates?

            "article_content": "Did you miss the first presidential debate? You can watch the full event online on CNN.com. By most accounts, Republican challenger Mitt Romney was the clear winner of Wednesday\u2019s first debate with President Barack Obama. Romney engaged the incumbent while Obama looked down at his lectern. The challenger was a more forceful debater while Obama appeared less than engaged. Here are five things we learned on Wednesday 1. Romney wins by setting the tone The crucial and tone-setting first 30 minutes of the debate belonged to Romney. Photos: The first presidential debate Obama: 'Please elaborate' on health care Romney: Banks reluctant to give loans Best 'zingers' from debate night Romney appeared practiced, at ease, confident and fluent in all things Obama. He aggressively criticized the president\u2019s record while also outlining, however vaguely, his own ideas about taxes and the deficit. Obama \u2013 his answers slow, dry and cautious \u2013 looked shaky. When the sparring turned to taxes \u2013 an issue on which voters trust Obama over Romney, according to polls \u2013 Romney played down legitimate questions about his tax plan and stressed again and again that he wants to reduce taxes on middle income families. Opinion: Romney shakes up the race He seized on Vice President Joe Biden\u2019s latest verbal miscue about how the middle class has been \u201cburied\u201d by the policies of the last four years. \u201cUnder the president\u2019s policies, middle-income Americans have been buried,\u201d Romney said. \u201cThey\u2019re just being crushed. Middle income Americans have seen their income come down by $4,300. This is a tax in and of itself. I\u2019ll call it the economy tax. It\u2019s been crushing.\u201d Obama had a chance to brush his opponent back by hammering home the fact that Romney has been strikingly vague in explaining just how he would pay for an across the board 20% tax cut without cutting cherished tax deductions. Fact Check: Does repealing Obamacare hike seniors\u2019 drug costs? Instead, a lethargic Obama veered into a plodding, numbers-based criticism of Romney\u2019s tax plan that was a far cry from his campaign trail rallying cries about how Republicans favor the rich. Obama\u2019s performance in the first part of the debate called to mind a segment on \u201cThe Daily Show\u201d in the early days of the Obama administration, when Jon Stewart teased the newly burdened president\u2019s press conferences as boring and uninspiring \u2013 a far cry from the inspirational figure of 2008. Romney entered the encounter with Obama battered, weary and under fire from his fellow Republicans. At the end of the night, he stood on equal footing in a 90-minute debate with the president of the United States. That\u2019s a win. Candidates hit campaign trail after Romney\u2019s strong debate 2. Romney holds his own It was the biggest question coming into this first showdown: Could Romney seem presidential standing next to the Obama? The answer appears to be yes. CNN Focus Group: Best moments CNN Focus Group: Worst moments Analyst: Election now 'a horse race' Rubio: Obama uncomfortable at debate \u201cHe held his own against the president of the United States, and for a Republican challenger that\u2019s pretty good,\u201d commented CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer, chief anchor of the network\u2019s political coverage. \u201cRomney at least held his own on the big questions: On the economy and the role of government,\u201d added CNN Chief National Correspondent John King. \u201cWhen you\u2019re the challenger and you at least hold your own with the president of the United States in the very first debate, you walk off the stage happy.\u201d Opinion: It wasn\u2019t just Romney who won Romney\u2019s campaign was thrilled with its candidate\u2019s performance. \u201cIf it was a boxing match, it would have been called,\u201d said Eric Fehrnstrom, a senior adviser to the former Massachusetts governor. \u201cI\u2019ve got to believe that the heels on the president\u2019s shoes are worn down from being back on them for 90 minutes.\u201d As you can imagine, the Obama campaign saw the debate very differently. \u201c(Romney) was on defense all night long,\u201d said David Plouffe, a senior adviser to the president. It appears debate watchers think Romney passed the test every challenger faces in trying to stand with an incumbent president. According to a CNN/ORC International poll conducted right after the session, 67% of debate watchers questioned said that Romney won. One in four said Obama was victorious. 25 funniest tweets about the debate 3. Missed opportunities Heading into the debate, there was a belief, an expectation that Obama would challenge Romney on the infamous 47% remark in an attempt to paint the former Massachusetts governor as a cold-hearted patrician with little empathy for the middle class and poor. If executed correctly, it could have put Romney on defense and changed the tenor of the debate. Obama didn\u2019t do it, which turned out to be a major mistake. Nor did the president question Romney on why he wouldn\u2019t release more details about his taxes. Another opportunity lost in an effort to try and portray Romney as being an out-of-touch elitist. Obama\u2019s failure to take the fight to Romney and the challenger\u2019s ability to dictate the tone and speed of the debate helped Romney win. Opinion: Romney wasn\u2019t stellar, Obama fell short The narrative heading into the evening was that Romney\u2019s campaign was listing and in serious need of a win. To Romney\u2019s credit, he never blamed his staff for problems that beset his campaign over the past few weeks and he was the one who righted the ship. Romney made the case that he was in the race to help the middle class at the same time advocating a government that was more business friendly. Romney\u2019s repeated references to business \u2013 particularly his pledge to help small businesses \u2013 opened a door for Obama to bring in the former Massachusetts governor\u2019s time at Bain Capital. It was never brought up. Romney\u2019s strong performance comes at a critical time as conservatives have been openly criticizing his campaign and poll numbers in key battleground states such as Ohio were trending toward Obama. Romney played offense, while Obama was forced to play defense. With 33 days until Election Day \u2013 you don\u2019t want to be on defense. At crossroads of economic crisis, debate disappoints 4. Body language matters Sometimes how a candidate looks is more important than what he says. That may have been the case in the first presidential debate, in which Romney often looked more at ease than Obama. When speaking, Romney often looked directly at Obama, while the president mainly looked at the moderator or the cameras when he was speaking. And Obama looked down quite often while Romney was speaking. \u201cThe president could barely look at Mitt Romney, which was interesting. He really wouldn\u2019t engage with him, where as Romney would take the president on, on every issue.\u201d said CNN Chief Political Analyst Gloria Borger. While Romney\u2019s body language seemed energetic, the president\u2019s body language was just the opposite. He seemed a bit irritated. Fact Check: Job creation versus unemployment \u201cI don\u2019t think anyone\u2019s ever spoken to him like that over the last four years. I think he found that not only surprising but offensive. It looked like he was angry at times,\u201d added CNN Senior Political Analyst David Gergen, who has advised both Democratic and Republican presidents. While Romney took part in nearly 20 GOP primary debates this cycle, Obama has not participated in a debate in four years. And it showed. \u201cParticipating in so many Republican primary debates helped Mitt Romney. He was, right from the beginning, more comfortable debating. The president was rusty as a debater. He hasn\u2019t done this in four years.\u201d King said. Senior Obama campaign advisers disagreed, saying that it was Romney who appeared ill at ease. \u201cPeople at home saw (Romney) get testy, interrupt the moderator,\u201d Obama campaign deputy communications director Stephanie Cutter told CNN. \u201cMy thought is that you\u2019re going to find that people watching at home thought he was quite testy,\u201d Plouffe added. Read the transcript of the first presidential debate 5. Chris Christie vindicated New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie bothered the heck out of Romney-world last Sunday when he shirked the expectations game and stated flatly that the GOP nominee would deliver an earthquake of debate performance that would turn the presidential race \u201cupside down.\u201d Not on message in the slightest. But it turns out Christie might have been right. In the post-debate spin room, the very same Romney backers who were hyper-cautious heading into Wednesday night\u2019s debate were suddenly sounding a lot like Christie. \u201cChris Christie is quite the prognosticator,\u201d said Romney adviser Eric Fehrnstrom. Fact Check: Oil and natural gas production under Obama South Dakota Sen. John Thune said Romney assuaged the Republican concerns about his candidacy \u2013 and then some. \u201cI think this was a make or break moment for the Romney campaign and he delivered,\u201d Thune told reporters. \u201cThis is a whole new ball game.\u201d One high-ranking Romney adviser also acknowledged what no one on their team would admit prior the debate: That a poor showing Wednesday could have derailed Romney\u2019s candidacy. \u201cWe needed a big performance and we got a big performance,\u201d the adviser told CNN. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of relief right now.\u201d After the debate concluded, Christie adviser Bill Palatucci made sure to plug his boss. \u201cOnly Chris Christie had the guts to say what he really thought \u2013 that Mitt would shine,\u201d Palatucci told CNN in an email.

In 2008, Republican presidential candidate John McCain spoke less in each debate \u2013 from at most five minutes to as little as about 20 seconds \u2013 than did then-Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama.

Sometimes it\u2019s the candidate who speaks for a shorter period of time that can win the day. \u201cThe thing about politicians is they like to talk, so they have long versions for everything,\u201d said Allan Louden, chair of the communications department at Wake Forest University. \u201cWhen you\u2019re coaching in debates, the goal is to get them to say in one minute [what they would] in five.\u201d 10 debate moments that mattered President Obama came up against his long-winded nature during a CNBC town hall event when then-Obama supporter Velma Hart told the president she was \u201cexhausted\u201d from defending him. He said he was going to change things in a meaningful way for the middle class. \u201cAnd I\u2019m waiting, sir, I\u2019m waiting,\u201d Hart said, thinking she would tee Obama up for a \u201cwhimsical, magical\u201d response. Instead of answering Hart\u2019s question, Obama talked around it for four minutes. CNN\u2019s Howard Kurtz called it a \u201cmissed opportunity,\u201d in a Washington Post column. Sen. Portman: My job is to dig deep Debates: Style over substance? Ann Romney: Mitt writes 'Dad' before debates Michelle Obama: Debates make me nervous Still political experts agree that time is only one part of the equation. It\u2019s the context and the candidate that also matter in the debates. And the context or the format in Wednesday\u2019s debate could cut both ways for Obama and Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney. The format, which differs from some past formats that kept answers and rebuttals short, will force the candidates to speak for longer periods of time on each question. When candidates said \u2018no\u2019 to debates In a 1992 debate, the longer format saw President George H. W. Bush glancing at his watch while an audience member asked the candidates a question, a move that put off many watching on TV and in the audience. This time around, candidates will be asked six questions in segments of 15 minutes each. They will be given two minutes to answer each question and the moderator will use the balance of time to direct the discussion. \u201cThey could actually debate [this time around] \u2013 that could be interesting,\u201d Louden said, comparing Wednesday\u2019s debate to those in past election years which featured one-minute answers and two-minute rebuttals. For Obama, whose campaign has been trying to lower expectations for the debate by saying the president struggles with being concise, political experts say the longer period of time could help his style. \u201cObama tends to not debate in sound byte, but explain in paragraph form,\u201d said Bill Newnam, associate director of forensics at Emory University. \u201cI think it ends up playing to Obama\u2019s benefit in that he has a longer time to talk.\u201d But the format could also reveal the candidates\u2019 weaknesses, since they will be forced into a less scripted, longer response. \u201c[Obama\u2019s] job is really to not make mistakes,\u201d Nyhan said, explaining that the longer response time could leave Obama exposed. \u201cSo maybe that\u2019s good for Romney that Obama would have more time.\u201d The power of the 'October Surprise' Reagan: 'There you go again' Bush checks the time Romney\u2019s sparring partner offers glimpse into GOP debate prep For Romney, the longer discussion time could cause him to lose his cool, as he did in the primary debates when he came down on Texas Gov. Rick Perry for going over his allotted time. \u201cRomney\u2019s tendency is to not deal as well in an impromptu setting and to be thin skinned to direct challenges,\u201d Newnam said. But, Newnam says, Romney\u2019s extensive preparation will benefit him. \u201cHe has been very concise and precise in debates,\u201d Newnam said. \u201cAs long as he knows what he is talking about and is prepared for the questions [he will be successful].\u201d While presidential campaigns have their unexpected moments, Nyhan says, time management will not be a weakness for the candidates at the presidential level. \u201cThe thing to remember about presidential debate is that these people didn\u2019t get here by accident,\u201d Nyhan said. \u201cWhile neither Romney nor Obama is known to be an especially fantastic debater, these are skilled national politicians.\u201d The moderator\u2019s control of the time also likely won\u2019t be problematic, Nyhan said. \u201cThese moderators were chosen because both sides could agree on them, which means that both sides will try very hard to be even handed,\u201d he said, referring to the process through the Presidential Debate Commission that determines the moderators. While the campaigns don\u2019t choose the moderators, they are asked for input. Instead, how the candidates come across, not the length of time they answer their questions, will help choose a winner, Louden said. \u201cAuthenticity is what trumps,\u201d Louden said. The next day, how the media and campaigns react may matter more than what happened at the debates themselves. \u201cIn the end, the debates are about the post-spin,\u201d he said.",

            "article_content": "Obama camp believes he has opening with veterans in Virginia this time Romney says lower U.S. economic productivity a 'real challenge' Paul Ryan says Obama economic policies cause uncertainty for business George Soros committing $1 million to super PAC backing Obama's reelection bid Mitt Romney and Barack Obama courted veterans on Thursday in the battleground state of Virginia, appearing in communities that illustrate the state\u2019s heavy military presence and its reliance on defense spending for jobs. For the second-straight day, the pair campaigned in the same battleground state. Obama stopped near Virginia Beach while Romney spoke at a rally in Springfield, just down the road from the Pentagon. The two were in Ohio on Wednesday. Obama and Romney spent time in Virginia appealing to veterans and those connected with the defense industry as crucial voter groups in the state with 13 electoral votes that usually trends Republican but went for Obama last time. It currently gives Obama a narrow lead in polls. Virginia weathered the overall economic downturn better than most other states, partly due to its strong military association and contracting links. But cities and towns are now nervous about uncertainty surrounding defense spending in an era of soaring deficits. Different messages in battleground state Avlon: It's the social issues, stupid New polls: Wake-up call for Romney Ohio GOP do not believe poll numbers Obama looks for veteran support in Virginia Virginia would be hit hard if steep proposed budget cuts aimed at reducing federal red ink take hold next year absent a deal by Congress to forestall or soften them. The state could lose more than 130,000 jobs if a spending deal is not reached, according to an industry study by George Mason University in July. Describing the cuts as a \u201cgun-to-your-head\u201d approach originally proposed by the White House and passed by Congress, the Republican nominee told a \u201cVeterans for Romney\u201d event that the impact on Virginia would be \u201cdevastating.\u201d Review military spending He also cautioned the world was too \u201cdangerous\u201d to chip away at U.S. military power. \u201cI want a military so strong, nobody wants to test it,\u201d Romney said, evoking the words that underpinned Ronald Reagan\u2019s defense buildup in the 1980s - \u201cpeace through strength.\u201d Romney said he would review excess military spending to make the Defense Department more efficient and add 100,000 active duty service members. He also pledged to use the money saved in the defense budget to care for veterans. Obama vs. Romney: How they\u2019d handle the $7 trillion fiscal cliff Obama appeared near Virginia Beach, home of the Naval Air Station Oceana. He lost the city by one point in 2008 largely due to the support for John McCain, a former Navy pilot, famed war prisoner, and staunch supporter of military issues in Congress. But Obama campaign aides believe they have a larger opening this election with veterans in light of the president\u2019s more muscular than expected foreign policy and Romney\u2019s widely noted omission of service-member related issues in his convention address. \u201cIf you stand with me, and work with me, we\u2019ll win the Tidewater again. We\u2019ll win Virginia again,\u201d Obama told an enthusiastic crowd at an outdoor pavilion. Neither Romney nor Obama served in the military. Obama contrasted his economic plan outlined in a campaign ad airing in key battleground states. Romney, Obama said, \u201cDoubled-down on trickle down,\u201d policies that \u201ccreated the crisis in the first place.\u201d Obama said his plan focuses on tax cuts for the middle class and \u201cgrowing the economy from the middle out.\u201d The president also sought more mileage from Romney\u2019s controversial comments, made in May but just surfacing last week, that nearly half of Americans who don\u2019t pay income tax view themselves as \u201cvictims.\u201d \u201cI travel around a lot in Virginia and across this country, I don\u2019t meet a lot of victims,\u201d the president said. \u201cI see a whole bunch of veterans who have served this country with bravery and distinction. And I see soldiers who defend our freedom every single day,\u201d he said. Romney hammers Obama over sluggish GDP numbers Though, the weak economy is the top issue for most Americans. In a surprise, revised economic data released on Thursday showed slower second-quarter growth than originally thought. Gross domestic product, the broadest measure of the nation\u2019s economic health, grew at an annual rate of 1.3% from April to June, the Commerce Department said, slower than the 1.7% rate last reported in August. \u201cThis is a real challenge for us,\u201d Romney said. \u201cAnd this is not just one quarter. This has been going on now for years.\u201d Ryan shifting to economy After spending time in Colorado yesterday, hammering away at the president on foreign policy, the Republican vice presidential nominee, Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wisconsin, also shifted to the economy at a campaign fundraiser in Knoxville, Tennessee. Ryan said the president\u2019s economic policies cause uncertainty for businesses. Virginia polls suggest race could be close A string of recent polls suggest the president is maintaining a narrow lead over Romney and the Obama campaign is confident wins in both Ohio and Virginia will essentially foreclose any path Romney has to the 270 electoral votes needed to win the White House. But it is very close. In two out of three recent polls, the margin of error, coupled with the percentage of undecided voters, leaves Virginia up for grabs. The latest, a Suffolk University/WWBT-Richmond survey, shows Obama with a 46%-44% edge among likely voters in Virginia. Two point margin is within the poll\u2019s sampling error. Seven percent are undecided. Obama\u2019s 2008 victory made Virginia \u2013 historically a Republican stronghold \u2013 a battleground. No Democratic presidential candidate had won the state since Lyndon Johnson\u2019s landslide in 1964. Fresh polls give Obama the advantage in four crucial battlegrounds Voters in Iowa had their first chance to cast ballots in the presidential election Thursday, marking the first battleground state to begin in-person early voting. Idaho, South Dakota, New Jersey, Vermont and Maine all began in-person early voting earlier this month. Big Soros donation Separately, Democratic fundraisers got a boost with news that billionaire financier George Soros would commit $1 million to a super PAC backing Obama\u2019s reelection bid, Priorities USA  Action.  In May, Soros donated $1 million to the left-leaning super PAC American Bridge. Priorities fundraising has lagged independent Republican groups like American Crossroads, Crossroads GPS, Restore Our Future, and Americans for Prosperity, which support Romney\u2019s campaign. Romney and Obama square off in their first debate October 3 in Denver.

            "article_content": "NEW: Elizabeth Warren delivers rousing prime time speech at Democratic convention NEW: Senate candidate Warren directs some of her comments at voters in Massachusetts Warren took heat from Republicans for taking on Wall Street, nomination to key post stalled Warren is a Harvard law professor whose message was aimed at boosting middle class For a first-time candidate in one of the tightest and most closely watched Senate races, there may not be a better opportunity to raise your profile than a prime-time speaking slot at the Democratic convention as an opening act for former President Bill Clinton But that\u2019s where Elizabeth Warren stood on Wednesday night in Charlotte where she delivered a strident speech that brought a packed convention arena to its feet in thunderous appreciation. \u201cAmericans are fighters. We are tough, resourceful and creative. If we have the chance to fight on a level playing field \u2014 where everyone pays a fair share and everyone has a real shot \u2014 then no one can stop us,\u201d Warren said. A Harvard law professor, Warren is challenging Sen. Scott Brown, R-Massachusetts, for the seat he won in a 2010 special election to replace the late Democrat Ted Kennedy. It has been a tight race for the better part of a year, and Warren aimed key parts of her nationally televised address to Bay State voters. Begala: Clinton substantive and riveting Watch Bill Clinton's full DNC speech Fluke on Obama: 'We need him' Warren was best known before her campaign as a watchdog of the government\u2019s corporate bailout program, a top financial adviser to President Barack Obama, and the force behind a high-profile agency borne from the 2010 Wall Street reform legislation, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau. CNN Fact Check: The $2,000 question \u2026 She focused most of her convention appearance on the middle class, a major theme for Democrats at their convention and on the campaign trail. \u201cFor many years now, our middle class has been chipped, squeezed, and hammered,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople feel like the system is rigged against them. And here\u2019s the painful part: They\u2019re right. The system is rigged.\u201d While she didn\u2019t mention Brown in her speech, Warren went after the more conservative Mitt Romney, Obama\u2019s Republican opponent in November who she characterized as an uncompromising ally of Wall Street who would raise taxes on the middle class. \u201cMitt Romney wants to give billions in breaks to big corporations \u2014 but he and Paul Ryan would pulverize financial reform, voucher-ize Medicare, and vaporize Obamacare,\u201d she said of the former Massachusetts governor and his running mate. Warren repeated a line she frequently uses on the campaign trail, taking aim at Romney\u2019s infamous statement that \u201ccorporations are people.\u201d \u201cNo, Governor Romney,\u201d she said. \u201cCorporations are not people. People have hearts, they have kids, they get jobs, they get sick, they cry, they dance. They live, they love, and they die. And that matters.\u201d Well under way for about a year, Warren\u2019s race is one of the most expensive Senate campaigns in the country. Since entering the contest, Warren has raised a massive $28 million, with Brown also taking in more than $19 million. The question now is whether her speech will give her a boost to put her ahead of Brown. When Warren entered the contest a year ago, she quickly rose to the ranks of widely known and beloved Democrats, having already been a target of congressional Republicans for taking on Wall Street, a key GOP constituency. Political observers have described the race as crucial for determining control of the Senate. Democrats hold a four-seat margin in the 100-seat chamber. Additionally, two Independents reliably caucus with Democrats. The Senate campaign has largely grown into a competition over which candidate is the toughest advocate for everyday people. Republicans, however, try to frame her as a liberal ideologue with little to no centrist appeal. Warren got big spotlight at the convention, while Brown has not tied himself so closely to his party. Brown didn\u2019t make a high-profile speech at last week\u2019s GOP convention and he is less than shy about asserting his independent spirit as a Republican in typically Democratic Massachusetts. He launched a website this week critical of Warren on taxes and other issues.

            "article_content": "NEW: President Obama criticizes Mitt Romney; Paul Ryan compares Obama to Jimmy Carter NEW: Poll shows Romney with a slight lead in North Carolina Joe Biden says America is better off because 'Osama bin Laden is dead and General Motors is alive' Ryan precedes Democratic convention with North Carolina rally Democrats gather for their national convention on Tuesday, seeking to rebuff Republican attacks that the nation is worse off under President Barack Obama by emphasizing both what has been achieved and the further steps necessary to boost a sluggish economic recovery. The three-day convention concludes Thursday with Obama delivering a nationally televised speech that will serve as a response to last week\u2019s Republican convention that nominated Mitt Romney to run against him in November. Romney\u2019s campaign is focused on the question of whether Obama has made life better for Americans, arguing that continued high unemployment and sluggish economic recovery from the recession show White House policies have failed to deliver promised results. The \u201cbetter off\u201d strategy was famously employed in 1980 by Ronald Reagan who asked voters that question when running against incumbent Democrat Jimmy Carter. Reagan went on to win that campaign, also marked by national economic difficulties. Obama and Vice President Joe Biden launched their counter-attacks on Monday, telling Labor Day campaign events that the nation was better off than it was in 2009 and that Romney offered nothing new from Republican policies that they said failed in the past. Noting that Romney recently said the nation needed a \u201cnew coach,\u201d Obama told a Toledo, Ohio, event that \u201cthe problem is everybody\u2019s already seen his economic playbook. We know what\u2019s in it.\u201d Biden led an effort to sharpen the message of Democrats on the eve of the convention after other senior members struggled to formulate a definitive answer to the question of whether voters should feel better off since Obama took office. \u201cAmerica is better off today than they left us when they left,\u201d Biden told a Labor Day campaign event in Detroit, referring to the state of the nation the Obama administration inherited from the Republican administration of former President George W. Bush. \u201cYou want to know whether we are better off?\u201d Biden said, offering a favorite campaign line. \u201cI\u2019ve got a better off. Osama bin Laden is dead and General Motors is alive!\u201d Romney\u2019s running mate, Rep. Paul Ryan, kept up the Obama-Carter comparisons, telling a North Carolina crowd that \u201cevery president since the Great Depression who asked Americans to send them into a second term could say that you are better off today than you were four years ago, except for Jimmy Carter and for President Barack Obama.\u201d The back-and-forth between the campaigns is part of their competition on how the election gets framed in the minds of voters. Republicans want it to be a referendum on Obama\u2019s presidency, while Democrats seek a choice between differing political ideologies on the size and role of government. A senior Obama campaign official told CNN on Monday that viewers tuning in to the Democratic convention will hear about how specific Obama policies and ideas will bolster the middle class to strengthen economic growth. \u201cYou didn\u2019t hear one tangible idea\u201d at the GOP gathering in Tampa, Florida, the official argued. \u201cThe advantage of going second is you get the last word,\u201d the official said, adding that Democratic organizers don\u2019t need to \u201ctweak\u201d any of their messaging after the Republican gathering. First lady Michelle Obama will address the Democratic convention\u2019s first night, and former President Bill Clinton headlines the second night before Biden and Obama speak on the final night. The race overall is very close and a new poll on Monday indicated Romney holds a slight advantage in North Carolina. Obama narrowly won the battleground state four years ago, becoming the first Democrat to carry the Tar Heel state in a presidential election since Carter in 1976. \u201cYour country needs your help,\u201d Ryan told the North Carolina crowed on Monday. Republicans have long sought to portray Obama as unqualified for the challenge of fixing America\u2019s ailing economy, and much of last week\u2019s GOP convention focused on what they characterized as failed policies of the president that worsened an already bad economy. \u201cThe thrill and pixie dust of the Barack Obama presidency is gone,\u201d RNC chairman Reince Priebus told reporters Monday. \u201cThere is no hope. \u2026 After four years of Barack Obama we are not better off.\u201d Democratic figures initially struggled Sunday to come up with a definitive answer on whether voters felt that conditions had improved since Obama took office. Republicans pounced when Maryland Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley answered \u201cno\u201d to the question on CBS, and other top Democrats also had trouble giving a firm response. While Obama senior campaign adviser David Axelrod told Fox News, \u201cWe\u2019re in a better position than we were four years ago,\u201d he didn\u2019t directly answer the question if voters thought they were better off. \u201cI think the average American recognizes that it took years to create the crisis that erupted in 2008 and peaked in January of 2009,\u201d Axelrod said. \u201cAnd it\u2019s going to take some time to work through it.\u201d Biden and other Democrats had a sharper response on Monday. O\u2019Malley appeared on CNN to insist that the country as a whole was \u201cclearly better off\u201d since jobs are being created on a monthly basis, rather than lost. But he still stipulated that more work had to be accomplished in reversing what he called the \u201cBush recession.\u201d Brad Woodhouse, Democratic National Committee communications director, in an appearance on CNN\u2019s \u201cEarly Start,\u201d set the tone for Biden, who spoke at a rally in the hometown of GM, which was rescued by the federal government in 2009. He likened Obama to a pilot who saves a crashing plane. \u201cThe truth is that the American people know, we were literally a plane, the trajectory was towards the ground. He got the stick and pulled us up out of that decline,\u201d Woodhouse said.

            "article_content": "Mitt Romney heads for Isaac-affected Gulf Coast; Paul Ryan stumps in Virginia Romney adviser: \"We didn't need to move a mountain. We just needed to push forward\" As the nominee, Romney now is free to spend big bucks on ads Democrats' convention will aim to blunt whatever bounce Romney gets Mitt Romney departed Tampa, Florida, on Friday hoping to ride any momentum he had built up over the past week as he makes the final turn into the November election. Romney\u2019s acceptance address won\u2019t go down as often quoted but it got the job done. He introduced his version of himself to America after months of his persona being defined by President Barack Obama\u2019s campaign and allies. He and running mate Paul Ryan tried to plant a seed of doubt about the next four years of an Obama administration. They didn\u2019t offer much in the way of specifics about how a Romney administration would shift the sluggish economy into a higher gear but had plenty of reasons why Obama\u2019s administration hasn\u2019t. Even Romney\u2019s advisers weren\u2019t predicting a slingshot out of the convention, but they didn\u2019t sound as if they were expecting one. CNN contributors: Did Romney gain ground? \u201cWe didn\u2019t need to move a mountain,\u201d a Romney adviser told CNN\u2019s Candy Crowley. \u201cWe just needed to push forward, move the ball down the court, and he did.\u201d Republican convention: The best photos RNC declares Romney and Ryan nominees Voters weigh in on Romney's speech Clint Eastwood's entire RNC speech Democrats hope they can slow whatever momentum that comes out of Tampa with their convention that starts on Tuesday in Charlotte, North Carolina. \u201cWhatever there is, I think we can blunt that pretty quickly,\u201d one an official with Obama\u2019s re-election team said last week while speaking with reporters at CNN. Perhaps bigger than whatever bounce Romney might get out of the convention will be his ability to go on an ad spending spree. Federal law prevented Romney from spend the millions of dollars he\u2019s been sitting on until he officially became the party\u2019s nominee. That will allow Romney to spread his message far beyond the campaign trail. Republicans sent their ticket off from Tampa before Romney and Ryan split up so that Romney could visit Louisiana at the invitation of Gov. Bobby Jindal, who had been considered as a Romney running mate, to tour areas damaged by Hurricane Isaac. Touring New Orleans with Jindal and Sen. David Vitter, Romney said he was there to \u201clearn and obviously to draw some attention to what\u2019s going here so that people around the country know that people down here need help.\u201dRyan went on to Virginia, where he continued a theme that emerged in his and Romney\u2019s convention speeches: that the president isn\u2019t a bad guy \u2013 it\u2019s just that his policies are wrong. \u201cWe are not going to go to you and say, \u2018Vote against the other guy because he\u2019s no good.\u2019\u201d Ryan told a crowd in Richmond. \u201cWe could do that because the record\u2019s no good, but we want to do more than that. You deserve more than that. \u201cWe\u2019re offering solutions. We\u2019re offering specific ideas. We\u2019re saying here\u2019s how you take these principles that built America: liberty, freedom, free enterprise, self-determination, government by consent of the government.\u201d John Avlon: Is that the best Romney can do? Pushing those principles also emerged in the convention as did a common theme accusing the president of division and demagoguery \u2013 perhaps a preemptive assault on the Democrats\u2019 message coming out of Charlotte next week. The Romney camp knows it has to make women and young voters take a second look at the Republican ticket and shore up middle-class support if it has any chance of winning the race, which has been locked in a dead heat for most of the summer. And that was part of the plan for Tampa \u2013 to make Romney more palatable to the first two groups and raise doubts about Obama in the third. \u201cYou listened to the last guy running for president who laid out his plan, but he was unable to do it,\u201d Romney said before leaving Florida. Give someone else a chance. Hold us accountable.\u201d Who won and who lost in Tampa Obama\u2019s challenge next week is to erase any doubts among women and young voters and keep the middle class from being seduced by Romney\u2019s message. Romney: I wish Obama had succeeded David Frum on Romney's acceptance speech DNC Chair: No specifics in Romney speech To that end, former President Bill Clinton will put Obama\u2019s name into nomination. The 42nd president has been appearing in ads touting Obama\u2019s economic policies. \u201cHe\u2019s a great validator of what we want. He\u2019s viewed as an expert on how to move the economy forward and how to build it from the middle class out,\u201d one official said. \u201cThere are few people who can speak to that authoritatively, and he\u2019s one of them \u2013 because he\u2019s done it. He\u2019s sat in the chair.\u201d Expect much of the program to play off the president\u2019s likeability ratings and how voters feel he can better empathize with their struggles while painting the GOP as more focused on what they call failed policies of the past; the Democrats also will likely paint Ryan\u2019s radical reform plans for Medicare and other entitlement programs as rewarding the wealthy at the expense of the middle class. Obama told Time magazine in an interview this week that Democrats are not proposing radical solutions, and the nation doesn\u2019t need drastic changes. \u201cIf you\u2019re willing to raise taxes on millionaires and billionaires, then you can make modest reforms on entitlements, reduce some additional discretionary spending, achieve deficit reduction and still preserve Social Security and Medicare and Medicaid in ways that people can count on,\u201d Obama told Time, later adding that the country needs \u201csome commonsense solutions that stay focused on helping middle-class families.\u201d \u201cThe only reason that you would have to go further than that is if there\u2019s no revenue whatsoever,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s a major argument that we\u2019re having with the Republicans.\u201d First lady Michelle Obama will also have a prominent role, speaking on the convention\u2019s first night. Campaign officials said the first lady helps augment the campaign\u2019s strategy to use the convention as a way to show \u201cwhat drives (the president) every day.\u201d One of the Democrats\u2019 leading protagonists, Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz, said her party\u2019s convention will have a different feel from that of the GOP. \u201cWe\u2019re gonna have the most inclusive \u2013 very different from this week\u2019s invitation-only, special interest-funded corporate-infused affair.

            "article_content": "High stakes as GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney takes the stage Thursday Romney must prove that he is not only capable but also likeable Bar was set high by running mate Rep. Paul Ryan during his own speech The window to make a good impression is very narrow The challenge for Mitt Romney as he accepts the Republican presidential nomination is to push past the stiff and reserved perception that\u2019s been created for him by opponents and comedians and make a heartfelt and profound appeal to the millions of Americans who will be watching his speech Thursday night. Romney advisers say their biggest goal is to improve his likability and make the case that he understands how Americans are struggling and that he empathizes with the middle class. His highly anticipated speech follows blockbusters from former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and running mate Rep. Paul Ryan. The latter energized the convention and set a high bar for Romney with a point-by-point critique of Obama\u2019s presidency and what Republicans have tried to characterize as a failed administration. Ryan\u2019s speech set the stage for Romney\u2019s address, which is intended to provide Americans just tuning in to the election with an introduction to the candidate and how he would move the country\u2019s stagnant economy forward. His wife, Ann, spoke on the convention\u2019s first night and tried to tell Americans about her husband in human terms. Now, it is Romney\u2019s moment, analysts say. Opinion: What Romney needs to say to win Romney\u2019s speech has \u201cto be more soaring and set a vision of where we could go under his leadership that is compelling,\u201d CNN Senior Political Analyst David Gergen said. \u201cIf could I use a metaphor, it\u2019s like a plane. I think Paul Ryan put one wing on the plane. \u2026 Ann Romney put another wing on the plane. \u2026 Condi Rice put some fuel in the engine. Now, Mitt Romney has got to fly the plane.\u201d Ron Bonjean, a veteran GOP strategist for several congressional leaders and partner at the political communications firm Singer Bonjean Strategies, said Romney has to \u201cknock it out of the park.\u201d Romney and Ryan: 'A generation apart' GOP stars throw support behind Romney \u201cThis is the moment. The opportunity. It\u2019s up to him to rise to that occasion.\u201d Democrats convene next week, so the pressure is amplified and the window to make a lasting impression is small: Any bounce Romney might receive from his performance might be quickly eclipsed by President Barack Obama\u2019s acceptance speech at the Democratic National Convention. A Romney campaign adviser said Thursday morning that speakers on the final evening of the convention will focus on telling Romney\u2019s \u201cpersonal story,\u201d beyond the prevalent image of the multimillionaire businessman and former Massachusetts governor waging a five-year quest for the White House. Those scheduled to speak include former business associates, three people who worked alongside Romney in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints and his lieutenant governor in Massachusetts, according to Romney strategist Russ Schriefer. Notable Republican leaders who will speak before Romney include former House Speaker Newt Gingrich and his wife, Callista, as well as former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush, Schriefer said. Florida Sen. Marco Rubio, a conservative Hispanic-American considered a rising star in the party, will introduce Romney. Romney senior adviser Eric Fehrnstrom said the candidate will discuss his view of the role of government, offer his biography, review what he calls Obama\u2019s failures and provide his vision on how to solve the nation\u2019s most pressing problems. He added that the GOP presidential hopeful will talk about his father, former Michigan Gov. George Romney. \u201cHe has three broad objectives,\u201d Fehrnstrom said Thursday of Mitt Romney\u2019s speech. \u201cFirst is to talk about his vision for a better future. He also is going to make the case against President Obama for the failures of the last four years. And he\u2019s going to talk about who he is. I think you\u2019ll enjoy the speech. He\u2019s very happy with it, and one thing we know about Mitt Romney is that he always rises to the occasion.\u201d For the 65-year-old, the nomination and tonight\u2019s speech put him within one step of the goal he first sought in 2007, when he ran for president after serving as a Republican governor for four years in traditionally Democratic Massachusetts \u2013 if he can overcome the likability hurdle. Even just a small show of emotion will help Romney, political experts say. Conventional wisdom says he must be more likable and connect with people, and in this case, conventional wisdom is accurate, said CNN Political Analyst Ari Fleischer, a White House press secretary for George W. Bush. \u201cHe needs to have people click and like him, sort of the way Paul Ryan naturally does.\u201d Fleischer said a good start would be an exchange with his younger running mate, who drew laughs when he joked about Romney\u2019s choice of music being like elevator music. \u201cThe moment I\u2019m looking for is that elevator music thing. Paul Ryan set it up. And I can\u2019t wait to see if the Romney people respond,\u201d Fleischer said. \u201cHe made the joke about his boss listens to elevator music. Mitt Romney (on Thursday) needs to make a joke back about Paul Ryan and music and elevator music. Humor for Mitt Romney is a big ingredient in making himself likable.\u201d The presidential race is locked in a dead heat, and while most voters polled say Romney would do a better job with the economy, Obama has a much higher likability factor. A CNN/ORC International survey released last week showed that 53% of likely voters think Obama cares about the needs of people, with 39% feeling the same way about the former Massachusetts governor. The president leads Romney in the poll by an equal margin when it comes to being in touch with the middle class. And six in 10 say Obama is in touch with the problems facing women today, with just over three in 10 feeling the same way about Romney. Romney has 48% to 44% margin over Obama on managing the government effectively and a 6-point advantage on having a clean plan for solving the country\u2019s problems. But 64% of all Americans and 68% of independents think Romney favors the rich over the middle class. That\u2019s the perception Romney has to push past if he wants to win over undecideds, said Paul Brewer, a professor of communication and assistant director for research Center for Political Communication at the University of Delaware. \u201cThe most common view of him is this aloof, rich guy that\u2019s the master narrative for him right now. He comes across as a competent orator, but not inspiring,\u201d Brewer said. \u201cHe needs to get messages out there that will be useful. \u2026 His message so far has been \u2018I\u2019m a good economic manager,\u2019 and that just doesn\u2019t cut it.\u201d Romney defends \u2018sterling\u2019 business record CNN\u2019s Tom Cohen and Paul Steinhauser contributed to this report.",

With both parties set to hold their conventions in the next few weeks, the political world will be watching to see who, if anyone, breaks out to become the next rising Democratic or Republican star. CNN Explains: Political conventions Drama is rare in modern conventions Will it be the high profile Cuban-American senator from Florida who was on Mitt Romney\u2019s vice presidential short list? Could the law professor-turned-consumer-rights-advocate-turned-Senate-candidate in Massachusetts break out? And what about the young, Latino mayor of San Antonio or the senator from Kentucky who is the son of Rep. Ron Paul? \u2018We need (a) Moses now because we\u2019re in the desert\u2019 Republican strategist Alex Castellanos says the next breakout GOP star should be a speaker who focuses not so much on policy but on vision, conviction, leadership, an orientation toward the future, and the establishment of an emotional connection with the audience. In other words, the next big GOP star must have what pundits frequently call \u201cthe vision thing.\u201d Rare opportunity for speakers at GOP convention Castellanos, a CNN contributor who was also the chief media consultant for Mitt Romney\u2019s 2008 presidential campaign, says the GOP is longing for someone who can paint a vision of a brighter future built on Republican principles \u2013 someone who, in Castellanos\u2019 words, can compellingly deliver the message, \u201cFollow me. There\u2019s a better place.\u201d \u201cWe need (a) Moses now because we are in the desert,\u201d the GOP strategist says. \u201cWe\u2019re stuck. We don\u2019t know where we\u2019re going.\u201d Rubio: Immigration isn't a talking point Sen. Rand Paul on taxes and compromise Raise taxes or cut defense spending? Utah's unlikely congressional candidate REPUBLICANS Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida: Even though he already has a substantial national profile, Rubio is the best bet to have an Obama-like performance at the GOP convention, Castellanos says. Elected with support from the tea party movement, a Latino and a fluent Spanish speaker, Rubio is from an important battleground state and the son of immigrant parents. He seems tailor-made to help the GOP speak to the nation about a brighter future under Republican stewardship. \u201cHe\u2019s the future of the party,\u201d Castellanos says. \u201cI\u2019d keep an eye on him. \u2026 He\u2019s the real thing. He has that gift.\u201d Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky: A fiscal conservative who is beloved by the tea party movement and the son of Ron Paul, Rand Paul also has potential to make a splash on the national stage, according to Castellanos. In particular, the freshman senator appeals to conservatives and libertarians who want to shrink the size, scope and power of the federal government. Sen. Kelly Ayotte of New Hampshire: Another tea party favorite from a battleground state, Ayotte was one of the few women believed to be on Romney\u2019s short list of vice presidential prospects. \u201cShe has tremendous potential,\u201d Castellanos says, \u201cShe could be your dark horse.\u201d Congressional candidate Mia Love: Black, Mormon and fiscally conservative, Love is an unlikely candidate to be the new face of the Grand Old Party.  But the mayor of Saratoga Springs, Utah, is greatly loved by tea party activists and by conservative women. Love is running to represent Utah\u2019s 4th Congressional District. If elected, she\u2019d be the first black Republican woman in Congress\u2019 lower chamber. Love is aware but resolute about her unique status in the GOP. \u201cThere are a lot of people who have tried to define me as a person,\u201d Love, the daughter of Haitian immigrants, told CNN in May. \u201cI\u2019m not a victim, and I don\u2019t allow anybody to put me in a box.\u201d \u2018Someone who can electrify the hall\u2019 Raw political talent is the first and most important criterion in picking a keynote speaker and doling out other prime-time speaking slots during a convention, according to Democratic strategist Paul Begala. \u201cYou\u2019re looking for someone who can electrify the hall and speak to the people back home,\u201d says Begala, a CNN contributor. Begala also highlighted a speaker\u2019s ability to address important themes. \u201cI want someone who can stand up there and talk about the middle-class American dream and how that dream persists because of the Democratic Party,\u201d Begala says, adding that the November election could well be decided based on whom voters believe is doing the most to support the middle class. Warren: U.S. banks still at risk San Antonio mayor discusses immigration Getting serious about gun control? AG wants charity board members fired DEMOCRATS Senate candidate Elizabeth Warren: The Democratic Senate candidate in Massachusetts would seem to be the perfect messenger to deliver her party\u2019s message about tackling income inequality. \u201cNobody fought harder for Wall Street reform, the reform that is now law and protecting consumers all across the country, than Elizabeth,\u201d Obama said after Warren introduced him at a June campaign event. \u201cShe has been a fierce advocate since before I knew her for the middle class, and she has been advocating on core issues that matter to families her entire career.\u201d Begala says, \u201cWhat she has is, I think, a very deep sense of how real people are affected by the economy. She\u2019s not just talking about abstractions.\u201d San Antonio Mayor Julian Castro: Castro has been tapped to give the keynote address at the Democratic convention.  Although he isn\u2019t well-known nationally, fellow Texan Begala says the mayor is known back in the Lone Star State. \u201cEverybody\u2019s been talking about him for a while,\u201d Begala says of Castro\u2019s reputation in Texas. Castro is the first Latino to deliver the Democratic keynote, according to convention organizers. Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper: Before the recent Colorado wildfires and the mass shooting in Aurora, Colorado, the state\u2019s Democratic governor was already one to watch. Hickenlooper is the highly regarded governor of a battleground state with a background as a small business owner. Colorado governor: Questions about Romney taxes \u2018almost visceral\u2019 California Attorney General Kamala Harris: California\u2019s chief law enforcement official is another one to watch, according to Begala. \u201cI\u2019ve been really impressed with her,\u201d the Democratic strategist says, adding that Harris has the needed combination of raw political talent and substantive knowledge to become a figure on the national political scene.",

            "article_content": "NEW: Romney calls for more oil drilling, less regulation Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan hit the campaign trail on Thursday New polls show President Obama maintaining a slight edge in three key states GOP officials say a possible hurricane won't derail Romney's nomination next week in Tampa Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan hit the campaign trail Thursday to pitch energy policy and defense spending, as new polls showed President Barack Obama maintaining a slight lead in three key swing states after Romney named the conservative House Budget Committee chairman as his running mate. Four days ahead of the Republican National Convention, certain presidential nominee Romney sought to build momentum with a continued focus on his economic policies mixed with attacks on Obama\u2019s handling of a stalling recovery. However, the controversy this week over Republican Rep. Todd Akin\u2019s incendiary remarks on \u201clegitimate\u201d rape and pregnancy has dominated the political chatter and raised questions about whether the conservative Christian from suburban St. Louis can unseat vulnerable Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill in Missouri. Threat against Akin being investigated Seeking to regain control of the campaign message, Romney traveled  to New Mexico to discuss a plan that he says will make America energy independent by 2020 \u2013 which would coincide with the conclusion of his second presidential term, if he gets elected twice. Touting the country\u2019s newly accessible oil and gas reserves, Romney repeated familiar themes \u2013 fewer federal regulations, more oil drilling \u2013 that he said would wean the country off imported oil and spark an economic boom at home. Democrats: Our convention will stall Romney Romney's plan for energy independence Akin assessing candidacy at RNC Obama's solar star fades in trade clash Fact-checking candidates on education He called for states to have control over drilling on federal land within their borders; opening new offshore areas to energy development; starting a fast-track approval process for energy projects including nuclear power, and limiting the ability of environmental groups to file lawsuits. Acknowledging that conventional sources of oil were dwindling, Romney said the new production would come from places like the deepwater Gulf of Mexico, Canada\u2019s oil sands and shale formations. CNN electoral map: Do the math In a position paper on the issue, Romney listed benefits from achieving energy independence as 3 million new jobs, $1 trillion in government revenues, a stronger dollar and lower energy prices. However, a recent report by the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office was less sanguine. The CBO report, which was requested by Ryan, said 70% of the nation\u2019s oil and gas reserves already were available for drilling. Opening the rest, it said, would increase government receipts from an estimated $150 billion under current policy to $175 billion to $200 billion over the next 10 years. Strippers count on GOP spending When asked to explain the difference, a Romney staffer said the campaign\u2019s projections were more inclusive and stretched out over a longer time period. Obama has touted increased oil production in recent years, and also opened up new areas for drilling in the Gulf of Mexico and indicated he\u2019ll issue permits to drill in the Arctic. Obama\u2019s troubled solar \u2018poster boy\u2019 At the same time, the administration has increased environmental and safety standards for offshore drilling and tightened emissions rules on power plants. The current administration has also issued fewer permits for drilling than George W. Bush, largely due to the moratorium imposed after the BP spill in 2010. On Thursday, Romney criticized Obama\u2019s support for renewable energy subsidies and highlighted companies that have received government funding and then gone bankrupt, such as Solyndra and Ener1. Wal-Mart moms not tipping their hand The administration has repeatedly defended its decision to invest in renewable energy companies, noting that energy from wind and solar projects have doubled since Obama took office. \u201cThe Republican approach is essentially one that is written by or dictated by big oil and it focuses almost entirely on oil and fossil fuels,\u201d White House Press Secretary Jay Carney said Thursday. Romney has said he would not support extending the federal subsidy for wind power, which expires at the end of the year. He called Thursday for the government to support advanced energy development at the basic research level, not at the commercialization phase. Ryan, meanwhile, spoke about about military spending at a defense industry roundtable in Fayetteville, North Carolina. The event came a day after a new CBO report outlined the potentially dismal impact of the impending \u201cfiscal cliff\u201d that includes the expiration of the Bush tax cuts and mandatory reductions in government spending, including defense outlays. Ron Paul, supporters change strategy The scheduled automatic cuts \u2013 known as sequestration \u2013 came about as a result of a compromise budget measure passed into law after congressional negotiations failed to agree on a deficit-reduction plan last year. Ryan voted for the compromise, saying at the time that it represented \u201ca victory for those committed to controlling government spending and growing our economy.\u201d Show us your budget, Ryan demands Peek inside strip clubs prepping for RNC Isaac threatens GOP convention Texas Judge: Civil war if Obama wins 1988: 'Read my lips, no new taxes' Now, he and Romney call the looming \u201cfiscal cliff\u201d an example of Obama\u2019s failed leadership. Democrats, however, blame what they call Republican intransigence in opposing Obama\u2019s push to extend the Bush tax cuts only for income over $250,000 a year for families and $200,000 a year for individuals. \u201cUnder a Mitt Romney administration, this will not happen,\u201d Ryan said of the automatic cuts to military spending. \u201cWe will reverse these reckless, devastating defense cuts that the president is bringing us toward.\u201d At the White House, Carney said a quick solution to the issue would come if Republicans ease their rigid opposition to ending tax cuts for wealthy Americans. Rick Warren cancels presidential forum The new Quinnipiac University/CBS News/New York Times polls showed Obama leading Romney by 49%-46% in Florida and 49%-47% in Wisconsin, which is Ryan\u2019s home state. Both results were within the margin of error, meaning the races are statistically even in those states. In Ohio, the poll showed Obama with a 50%-44% lead, just outside the sampling margin of error. Peter A. Brown, assistant director of Quinnipiac University Polling Institute, wrote in a statement accompanying the polls\u2019 release that Romney\u2019s choice of Ryan has made \u201csmall difference\u201d so far in the race. Will money be the difference maker? In Florida, support for Romney ticked up 1 percentage point from a poll taken before Ryan was added to the ticket. In Wisconsin, Romney inched up 2 percentage points. The Ohio numbers remained identical to a Quinnipiac University survey taken prior to the Ryan announcement. With a potential hurricane possibly heading toward Tampa, Florida, the site of the Republican convention scheduled to begin Monday, GOP officials made clear Thursday that Romney would be nominated as the party\u2019s presidential candidate next week regardless of whether the storm disrupts proceedings. \u201cWe do have contingency plans to deal with weather related and other circumstances that may occur to ensure that the business can go on at the RNC and Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan will become our nominees,\u201d RNC communications director Sean Spicer told CNN. Isaac gains strength by the mile \u201cWhile the safety of delegates and others attending next week\u2019s Republican National Convention was paramount, the actual business of nominating Romney would not be delayed by bad weather,\u201d Spicer said, adding: \u201cThere are contingency plans in place and rules of the RNC in place that ensure that will always be able to occur.\u201d The storm\u2019s path is uncertain, though some computer models show it could move up through Florida, including Tampa. Other models send it farther west, into the Gulf of Mexico. According to the latest forecast map from the National Hurricane Center in Miami, the storm \u2013 named Isaac \u2013 will pass near the Florida Keys early Monday as a Category 1 hurricane and northwest of Tampa by Monday evening. The convention is scheduled to run through Thursday evening when Romney will officially accept the  nomination and deliver his acceptance speech. The speech is considered a crucial moment for any presidential nominee because many voters are just beginning to tune in to the presidential election. Arrest made after threat to Obama Neither Obama nor Vice President Joe Biden have any campaign events scheduled Thursday. A new Obama campaign ad released Thursday features former President Bill Clinton \u2013 in increasingly visible surrogate for Obama. In the ad, Clinton attempts to draw a contrast between Republicans and Democrats as the November election approaches. Whither Sarah Palin? \u201cThis is a clear choice. The Republican plan is to cut more taxes on upper income people and go back to deregulation. That\u2019s what got us in trouble in the first place,\u201d Clinton says in the ad. \u201cPresident Obama has a plan to rebuild America from the ground up, investing in innovation, education, and job training. It only works if there is a strong middle class.\u201d He later adds: \u201cThat\u2019s what happened when I was president. We need to keep going with his plan.\u201d In his stump speeches, Obama frequently credits Clinton-era policies for the strong economy in the 1990s.

            "article_content": "NEW: Paul Ryan says Republicans will win debate on Medicare President Obama says Republicans are being dishonest about his plans Obama and the first lady campaign together for the first time since May Mitt Romney says Obama will \"do anything in his power\" to get re-elected President Barack Obama wrapped up a three-day bus tour of Iowa on Wednesday by accusing Mitt Romney of dishonest attacks on his record, while the certain Republican nominee continued to call Obama\u2019s re-election effort a hateful divide-and-conquer strategy. With less than three months until the November election, the negative campaign has become even more bitter since Romney chose House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan as his running mate. Ryan is best known for a conservative budget plan passed by the Republican-led House that would partially privatize Medicare, which Democrats say would kill the government-run health care program for senior citizens. A contentious struggle between the Obama and Romney camps to favorably frame the sensitive issue of Medicare has escalated campaign rhetoric to a personal level rarely reached in a presidential race. 'Dog eat dog' presidential campaign Romney continued the negative tone on Wednesday, saying in an interview with CBS that the Obama campaign is \u201cabout division and attack and hatred\u201d that is \u201cdesigned to bring a sense of enmity and jealously and anger.\u201d \u201cThe president seems to be running to hang on to power,\u201d the former Massachusetts governor said. \u201cI think he\u2019ll do anything in his power to try and get re-elected.\u201d Obama used his first campaign speech of the day to challenge Romney over a new television ad that accuses the president of cutting more than $700 billion from Medicare as part of the 2010 health care reform law. \u201cI think they know their plan is not very popular.  You can tell that because they are being pretty dishonest about my plan,\u201d Obama said of his Republican rivals. \u201cEspecially, by the way, when it comes to Medicare. This is something I have got to point out here because they are just throwing everything at the wall to see if it sticks.\u201d Raising his voice, Obama insisted that his health care policies strengthened Medicare, including reforms that saved senior citizens money on their prescription drugs and aimed to eliminate waste without cutting benefits. The Ryan plan would shift Medicare costs to beneficiaries by implementing a voucher system for helping them buy increasingly expensive private insurance, Obama said. \u201cMy plan has already extended Medicare by nearly a decade,\u201d he said. \u201cTheir plan ends Medicare as we know it.\u201d Ryan said said the president had raided Medicare and the White House was calling it an achievement. Republicans welcomed a discussion on the issue, he said. \u201cWe need this debate and we will win this debate,\u201d he told an audience at his alma mater, Miami University in Oxford, Ohio. Biden takes a dig at Romney Wilder to Biden: Say you were wrong Davis: Biden's remarks 'racial viciousness' In Virginia on Wednesday, Vice President Joe Biden sounded Democratic attack lines against Romney, depicting him as an out-of-touch multimillionaire intent on reviving policies that benefit the wealthy at the expense of the middle class. Recalling a saying by his own father \u2013 \u201cDon\u2019t tell me what you value; show me your budget and I will tell you what you value\u201d \u2013 Biden listed Romney policy proposals that he said demonstrated the values of the Republican challenger. These, Biden said, included repealing health care and Wall Street reform legislation, cutting spending on education, and reducing the size and scope of entitlements like Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security. \u201cThese guys aren\u2019t hiding the ball,\u201d Biden said, employing a football metaphor. \u201c\u2026 We know exactly what they want to do.\u201d On Tuesday, Romney and Republicans bristled when Biden accused Romney of promising to lift regulations on big banks in an effort to \u201cunchain Wall Street,\u201d adding: \u201cHe is going to put y\u2019all back in chains.\u201d Former Virginia Gov. Doug Wilder, a Democrat and the first African-American to be elected governor of Virginia, criticized Biden on Wednesday\u2019s \u201cThe Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer\u201dand said the remarks were \u201cappeals to race.\u201d Biden explained that he was playing off Republican references to the \u201cshackles\u201d that regulations place on the private sector, but Romney said Wednesday the comment was beneath the dignity of a presidential campaign. At the same time, Romney sounded conciliatory by adding that \u201cno one is talking about deregulating Wall Street.\u201d \u201cOf course, we have to have regulation on Wall Street and on every street to make sure our county works well,\u201d said Romney, who has previously called for repealing the Wall Street reform law that responded to the 2008 financial crisis. Romney has yet to detail what regulations he would support to replace that measure. Overall, the campaign focus has remained on Ryan and his budget plan. It calls for sharp cuts in non-military spending to shrink government as well as stark reforms to Medicare and the Medicaid program, which provides health care to the poor and the disabled. Ryan\u2019s proposals include the provision that Medicare-approved private insurers would one day compete with traditional government-sponsored Medicare on an exchange. The intention of his plan is to remake Medicare so that it remains financially viable for future generations, while preserving the benefits of current seniors and those who will qualify in the next 10 years, Ryan told CBS on Sunday. Republicans reject the Democratic tactic to tie Romney to the Ryan proposal, saying he has his own budget and tax plans that are similar to Ryan\u2019s but include key differences. Last month, the Congressional Budget Office said repealing the health care reform law, as called for by Romney and Ryan, would increase spending on Medicare by $716 billion through 2022. The non-partisan agency that reviews congressional budgets also said keeping Obama\u2019s health care reforms in place would not mean a $716 billion decrease in Medicare spending, as claimed by Romney and his campaign ad. The Obama campaign called Romney\u2019s claim \u201cdishonest and \u201chypocritical.\u201d \u201cThe savings his ad attacks do not cut a single guaranteed Medicare benefit, and Mitt Romney embraced the very same savings when he promised he\u2019d sign Paul Ryan\u2019s budget,\u201d Obama campaign spokeswoman Lis Smith said Tuesday. Romney sounded undaunted Wednesday, repeating the claim in the CBS interview when asked to comment about how Ryan\u2019s plan and Obama\u2019s health care reforms both include the $716 billion in Medicare savings that he criticizes. \u201cCongressman Ryan has joined my campaign, and his campaign is my campaign now. We\u2019re on exactly the same page,\u201d Romney said. \u201cMy campaign has made it very clear. The president\u2019s cuts of $716 billion to Medicare, those cuts are going to be restored if I become president and Paul Ryan becomes vice president.\u201d Ryan has yet to comment on the difference between his Medicare proposal, which was part of a broader budget and tax plan passed by House Republicans. A new poll released Wednesday showed little impact so far from Romney\u2019s choice of Ryan as his running mate, which was announced on Saturday. The Gallup Daily Tracking Poll showed Romney holding a statistically insignificant 47%-45% edge over Obama in the four days since the announcement, compared to 46%-45% in the four days prior to it. First lady Michelle Obama joined the president for his Iowa events Wednesday, which concluded a three-day bus tour through the state where Obama\u2019s 2008 campaign first took off. It was the first time the couple appeared together on the campaign trail since the first events of the re-election effort in May.

But days after defending against an offensive against his running mate, Mitt Romney\u2019s campaign appears to be mounting a counteroffensive. Opinion: Does Ryan Medicare plan make sense? President Barack Obama\u2019s re-election campaign launched a full frontal assault on the House Budget Committee chairman almost immediately after Republican challenger Mitt Romney named the seven-term congressman from Wisconsin as his running mate Saturday morning. The Obama campaign and fellow Democrats instantly attacked Ryan over his budget, terming it a \u201cradical plan\u201d that would benefit the rich at the detriment to the middle class, and they highlighted his proposals to alter Medicare, which they said would \u201cend Medicare as we know it.\u201d Pawlenty: Obama will cut Medicare Axelrod: Ryan not a Medicare believer Gingrey: Dems 'good job' scaring seniors Sununu debates Obama Medicare details The Romney campaign has fired back, accusing the president of hurting the popular entitlement program, cutting it to pay for his signature health care reform law. But they seemed at first reluctant to defend Ryan\u2019s plans, with mixed signals on whether Romney would embrace the proposals. On Tuesday, Ryan didn\u2019t bring up Medicare at his two campaign events in Colorado and Nevada, but he was asked about it in a TV interview. \u201cWe are the ones who are not raiding Medicare to pay for \u2018Obamacare,\u2019\u201d Ryan said Tuesday on Fox News in his first solo interview as a vice presidential candidate. \u201cPresident Obama is actually damaging Medicare for current seniors. It\u2019s irrefutable.\u201d Romney, Ryan field Medicare question in first joint interview The Obama campaign\u2019s attacks on Romney have been tough, and constant. Obama campaign senior adviser David Axeldrod told CNN\u2019s Candy Crowley on \u201cState of the Union\u201d on Sunday that Ryan was a \u201cright-wing ideologue.\u201d And on the campaign trail Monday in the battleground state of North Carolina, Vice President Joe Biden talked about Romney and Ryan \u201cgutting Medicare.\u201d With the presumptive GOP nominee in senior-rich Florida on Monday, the Obama campaign touted a Web video that included retirees questioning Ryan\u2019s Medicare plan. Democrats hit Ryan Medicare proposals as Romney heads to Florida \u201cIt doesn\u2019t make sense to cut Medicare. A voucher plan?\u201d asks one senior in the video. Ryan\u2019s proposals do call for a partial privatization of the government health insurance plan for seniors, but only for those now under age 55 that would go into effect in 2023. Romney won\u2019t name differences with Ryan on Medicare The Romney campaign has fired back, claiming that Obama has cut more than $700 billion from Medicare to pay for his health care law. \u201cWhen he ran for office he said he\u2019d protect Medicare, but did you know that he has taken $716 billion out of the Medicare trust fund, he\u2019s raided that trust fund, and you know what he did with it? He\u2019s used it to pay for Obamacare \u2013 a risky, unproven, federal government takeover of health care,\u201d Romney said Tuesday on the campaign trail in Ohio. And his campaign is going up with what it calls a substantial ad buy Wednesday with a spot that highlights its Medicare pushback. \u201cYou paid in to Medicare for years. Every paycheck. Now, when you need it, Obama has cut $716 billion from Medicare. Why? To pay for Obamacare,\u201d says the narrator in the commercial. Romney campaign takes to airwaves with Medicare response The Romney campaign got the $716 billion figure from a July 24 Congressional Budget Office report, which measured the impact of repealing the health care overhaul law, which is known by many as Obamacare. But the report also notes that the projected $716 billion increase in Medicare spending if the measure is repealed does not signal a $716 billion decrease if the measure stays in place \u2013 which is Romney\u2019s argument. The Romney strategy is simple: Accuse the president of robbing a popular program (Medicare) to pay for a program (The Affordable Care Act) in which support is divided. A Romney campaign official says, \u201cThe message here is that we are on offense on Medicare. This is a debate we invite.\u201d Obama, Romney spar over Medicare in battleground states One thing now appears apparent: The Romney campaign now will have to own the Medicare issue to come out on top in November. Labor group to target Ryan, Romney over Medicare \u201cThe Romney-Ryan ticket has now chosen to fight two wars, one on Medicare and one on the economy. They have to tie the first and win the second. If they are still fighting the first one in October, it is going to be hard to put the GOP ticket over the top, said GOP strategist and CNN contributor Alex Castellanos. \u201cThis is going to be a tough year for Grandma. The Democrats are going to say Republicans are pushing her wheelchair over the cliff again and Republicans need to explain, \u2018Too late, she\u2019s already down in the ravine, since Barack Obama has already cut $700 billion from Medicare for current seniors. By November 6, Grandma is going to be black and blue and bruised bottom-to-top,\u201d added Castellanos, who was a top media adviser for Romney\u2019s 2008 nomination bid. The Obama campaign sees the choice of Ryan as Romney\u2019s running mate as an opening and it\u2019s going to continue its attacks on his Medicare proposals, arguing that the plan won\u2019t play well in some crucial battleground states in the Midwest. \u201cThey certainly don\u2019t see the virtue of turning Medicare into a voucher program. They don\u2019t see the virtue of throwing millions of seniors out of nursing homes, and people with disabilities. They don\u2019t see the virtue in that, all to pay for tax cuts for the wealthy,\u201d Axelrod told CNN Chief National Correspondent John King, Tuesday in Iowa. But a longtime Republican strategist says the Democratic attack line won\u2019t work. \u201cIt seems that the Democrats live in the past like Marshal Henri Philippe Benoni Omer Joseph P\u00e9tain, the godfather of the Maginot Line in France in pre-World War II \u2013 use tactics that were successful in past battles. While scaring seniors on Medicare has had some marginal success in some races and some regions, that does not lead to success in every race in every region,\u201d said David Carney, a GOP strategist who earlier this cycle served as a senior adviser to Texas Gov. Rick Perry\u2019s bid for the Republican presidential nomination. The clock\u2019s ticking in the race to win the battle to define Ryan and his Medicare plan. Stay tuned.",

            "article_content": "Rep. Paul Ryan admits he is the poster child for controversial proposals CNN chief political analyst Gloria Borger calls Ryan \"a risky choice that could hurt Romney\" Leading conservative voices pushed Romney this week to be bold Just a few minutes after 7 a.m. on Saturday, Mitt Romney took a step many political experts did not think he would \u2013 choosing a controversial and bold running mate and making one of the most important announcements of his campaign at a time many did not expect. Rep. Paul Ryan admits that he is the poster child for controversial proposals to reform the nation\u2019s entitlement programs: For workers now under the age of 55, seniors would be given the option of choosing a private program instead of the traditional Medicare program and would receive money to offset the premium they have to pay. Federal spending for Medicaid would be sent to the states to manage, and the Social Security retirement age would gradually be raised to 70. Because of those positions and his full-throttled defense of them, CNN chief political analyst Gloria Borger calls the pick \u201ca risky choice that could hurt Mitt Romney\u201d and also said it \u201cmay be too risky, but is bold.\u201d Republican consultant Ford O\u2019Connell said making a bold choice like Ryan was necessary. Romney announces Ryan as his running mate How Romney chose his running mate Paul Ryan: I'm a policy person Ryan: Romney is the man for this moment Photos: Romney and Ryan set as Republican ticket \u201cWith Mitt Romney losing ground to President Obama in the polls, I don\u2019t see the selection of Paul Ryan as \u2018risky,\u2019 I see the choice as bold and necessary,\u201d O\u2019Connell wrote in an email to CNN. \u201cRyan will certainly help Romney shore up his support with the GOP base, and it will send a clear message to independent voters that Romney is serious about getting the country\u2019s fiscal house in order and putting Americans back to work.\u201d CNN senior political analyst David Gergen says the Ryan pick is, \u201can opportunity for the Romney campaign to go on the offense.\u201d Ryan is seen as a plainspoken Midwesterner who doesn\u2019t back down from positions. Democratic attacks on Ryan focus on changes to Medicare and Medicaid \u201cIf you don\u2019t address these issues now, they\u2019re going to steamroll us as a country. And the issue is the more you delay fixing these problems, the much uglier the solutions are going to be,\u201d Ryan told Borger in an interview last year. \u201cWe literally go about $10 trillion deeper in the hole of our unfunded government promises every year we delay fixing the problem.\u201d Several leading conservative voices, including the Weekly Standard and the Wall Street Journal, had pushed Romney this week to be bold. \u201cThe case for Mr. Ryan is that he best exemplifies the nature and stakes of this election. More than any other politician, the House Budget Chairman has defined those stakes well as a generational choice about the role of government and whether America will once again become a growth economy or sink into interest-group dominated decline,\u201d the Journal said in an editorial on Thursday. The Journal argued that a Ryan choice would help the Republicans. Opinion: How Ryan could help Romney \u201cThe larger strategic point is that Mr. Romney\u2019s best chance for victory is to make this a big election over big issues. Mr. Obama and the Democrats want to make this a small election over small things \u2013 Mitt\u2019s taxes, his wealth, Bain Capital. As the last two months have shown, Mr. Romney will lose that kind of election. To win, Mr. Romney and the Republicans have to rise above those smaller issues and cast the choice as one about the overall direction and future of the country.\u201d Ryan, a 42-year-old fitness freak, also brings a youthful vigor to the campaign and is an energetic campaigner and debater. He jogged tieless onto the stage on Saturday as Romney introduced him to a cheering crowd. But there will be those who question whether a House member whose primary focus has been fiscal issues is ready to be commander-in-chief. Obama\u2019s campaign quickly fired off a statement looking to define the contrasts in the campaign: The Republican ticket favors tax cuts for the wealthy while putting a greater burden on the middle class, it would gut Medicare and shift costs to the elderly, and it would make deep cuts in education. As statement from Obama campaign manager Jim Messina also invoked the B-word: \u201cAs a member of Congress, Ryan rubber-stamped the reckless Bush economic policies that exploded our deficit and crashed our economy. Now the Romney-Ryan ticket would take us back by repeating the same, catastrophic mistakes,\u201d Messina wrote. Exclusive: How Romney chose his running mate Besides the choice of who, political analysts also call the timing of the Ryan announcement bold. While most vice presidential picks have been announced only days before the Republican convention, Romney is unveiling his ticket \u2013 which the campaign is calling \u201cAmerica\u2019s Comeback Team\u201d \u2013 more than two weeks before the GOP gathers in Tampa, Florida. Some experts have said such an early choice would diminish any bump in the polls the campaign might see. The Romney campaign argues that the continuous news environment in the nation now means old rules may not apply. It is hoping that Ryan\u2019s unveiling will get a lot of positive coverage as it couples the announcement with a bus tour of swing states through Tuesday. Romney\u2019s aides hope the coverage will give the campaign a break from some of the bad press it has gotten over the last week following gaffes during his tour of Europe and Israel, relentless calls for Romney to release more of his tax returns and falling poll numbers. How do you feel about Romney selecting Ryan as his running mate? Let us know on CNN iReport.",

            "article_content": "GOP presidential hopeful Mitt Romney's campaign has struggled to gain traction President Barack Obama's campaign attack ads have taken a toll Polls show Romney lags on what experts say should be his strongest area: the economy Romney will have to choose a strong running mate, give great convention speech Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney is trying to shift into high gear, but elections experts say his campaign seems to be stuck in second. With just weeks before the nominating conventions and his national debut before a broader electorate, Romney\u2019s struggles to make the case that he is best equipped to pull the nation out of the economic doldrums could derail his quest for the presidency. Romney\u2019s biggest challenge? Turning the conversation back to the weak economy and poor job growth and away from President Barack Obama\u2019s re-election campaign\u2019s attacks on his tenure at private equity firm Bain Capital and refusal to release more tax records. Romney has stalled at this. Given the ailing economy, Romney should be faring much better, political experts say. \u201cOne way to measure this is \u2013 given the conditions of the country and the economy \u2013 one would think the challenger would be ahead and he\u2019s not,\u201d said CNN senior political analyst David Gergen. His tax plan, the release of which was intended to offer a punctuation mark on how he\u2019d handle the economy, was criticized by the Urban-Brookings Tax Policy Center. The plan would provide large tax cuts to the very wealthy while increasing the tax burden on the lower and middle classes. It would make it tough to recoup lost government revenue, according to the Brookings study. And those campaign attack ads from Obama\u2019s campaign and those supporting it aren\u2019t helping. Romney's battleground bus tour Battling bus tours on the campaign trail Reince Priebus talks polls and ads According to a CNN/ORC International poll of likely voters released Thursday, Romney\u2019s unfavorable rating jumped to 48% from 42% a month ago, a drop which followed a period in which the Obama campaign hammered the GOP presidential hopeful with a deluge of advertising and news stories about his time at Bain and calls for Romney to release more of his tax records, which he has refused to do. Obama now leads Romney by seven percentage points in the poll with 52% of registered voters questioned in the survey saying that they\u2019d vote to re-elect the president and 45% backing Romney. Worse, political experts say, is the somber news for Romney that only 45% of those polled by CNN said that the economy would get better if Romney were elected \u2013 two percentage points below Obama\u2019s number. A recent Fox news poll has Obama garnering 49% of the vote and Romney 40% if the election were held today. Obama\u2019s lead in that poll comes from an 11% lead among independent voters. In a Quinnipiac University/CBS News/New York Times swing state poll released recently, more than 50% of voters in the battleground states of Pennsylvania and Ohio said they do not feel Romney \u201ccares about the needs and problems of people\u201d like themselves. More than 50% of voters polled in those two states said Obama cares about their needs and problems. \u201cI think the Obama campaign is outmaneuvering the Romney campaign. They\u2019ve kept him on the defensive on his taxes and on Bain, which is a key foundation for his campaign,\u201d Gergen said. \u201cThis rat-a-tat of advertising, this avalanche of advertising has taken a toll.\u201d And in some cases, Romney has also been his own worst enemy, said Marc Hetherington, political science professor at Vanderbilt University. \u201cRomney hasn\u2019t helped himself by not putting these issues to bed with the tax situation and has allowed these issues to linger,\u201d Hetherington said. \u201cThis could have been a two-day story. That\u2019s time we\u2019re spending not talking about what Romney wants to talk about, which is the economy. He\u2019s put himself in a tough box here.\u201d Romney will have to pull out all the stops if he wants to change the narrative the Obama campaign has crafted, political experts say. \u201cHe has to capture the agenda back and remind people, \u2018I\u2019m the businessman who made a lot of money, and I can help you make lots of money,\u2019\u201d Hetherington said. \u201cIf he doesn\u2019t do that soon these ideas people have about him will harden. \u201cEvery step Romney makes \u2014 including his running mate \u2014 has to be getting back to where Obama is weak, and that\u2019s the economy.\u201d But there are pitfalls in Romney\u2019s choice. \u201c(Former Alaska Gov. Sarah) Palin is a classic example,\u201d said Matthew Continetti, author of \u201cThe Persecution of Sarah Palin: How the Elite Media Tried to Bring Down a Rising Star.\u201d \u201cYou see a motivating force for conservatives. Palin was electrifying. The downside is, is the candidate ready to have the spotlight shined on them? Are they ready for the tough questions such as Palin with Katie Couric? Are there holes in the biography that can be filled in by myth?\u201d Romney\u2019s best bet to help him shore up his conservative bona fides and flagging support is to choose someone who appeals to middle-class white voters without college degrees who understands them, Continetti said. The types of voters who have been hard hit by the economic downturn live in swing states and are the target of the Obama campaign\u2019s ads on what it casts as the human costs of Romney\u2019s financial success. It\u2019s a big task. The Obama campaign has tried to define Romney before he\u2019s had a chance to do it for himself. As a result, Romney\u2019s convention speech will be more important than ever, Gergen said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be his first chance to introduce himself to the country in terms of values and lay out his plan for the future\u2026 He\u2019s got to do that to close up this gap,\u201d Gergen said. \u201cIt\u2019s now clear that Romney can\u2019t win this election by default. It\u2019s not an apple that\u2019s going to fall into his lap because the economy is weak. He\u2019s got to take it away from (Obama).\u201d CNN\u2019s Paul Steinhauser, CNNMoney\u2019s Charles Riley and the CNN Political Unit contributed to this report",

In separate votes that amounted to political posturing in an election year, House Republicans joined by more than a dozen Democrats passed the GOP measure by a 256-171 margin. Minutes earlier, a similar tally defeated the Democratic alternative that would maintain the lower rates for income up to $250,000 for families and $200,000 for individuals for a year. Wednesday\u2019s votes extended a congressional stalemate over the Bush tax cuts from 2001 and 2003 that has come to symbolize legislative inaction in Washington. Why House tax vote is really about drawing battle lines for the fall Last week, the Senate passed the Democratic version in a sharply polarized 51-48 vote, while the Republican plan was defeated 45-54. Normally, a congressional conference committee would negotiate a compromise between the measures passed by each chamber, but the volatile tax issue has little chance of receiving further consideration before the November election. Rep. Van Hollen on the Bush-era tax cuts Panelists on the Bush-era tax cuts Hayworth: We're trying to help Americans Cummings: GOP holding tax cuts hostage Republicans seeking to shrink the size of government oppose any higher taxes and argue the Democratic plan of allowing rates to increase on higher-income Americans will stunt economic growth. GOP leaders say anything short of renewing all the current tax rates amounts to a massive tax increase on small businesses whose owners report their income through personal rather than corporate returns. Democrats contend Republicans are holding hostage tax breaks for the middle class \u2013 including 97% of small business owners \u2013 in order to keep lower tax rates for 2% of American taxpayers earning in excess of the $250,000 threshold. Both sides agree on extending the lower rates for middle-income Americans, Democrats argue, but they say Republicans are preventing that from happening out of allegiance to a dogmatic opposition to any kind of tax increase on even the wealthiest Americans. Opinion: Why are tax hikes politically radioactive? Democrats also point to polling that shows a majority of Americans support their approach. Wednesday\u2019s votes completed each party\u2019s opening bid in what is sure to be a frenzied legislative negotiating session after the November vote. The economy is approaching a so-called \u201cfiscal cliff\u201d brought on by the looming expiration of several tax cuts as well as the approach of a series of mandatory spending cuts.

            "article_content": "Mitt Romney's campaign challenges a report on the candidate's tax plan President Obama visits Ohio for the ninth time this year A new poll shows Obama ahead in Ohio and two other battleground states The Romney campaign launches a new ad criticizing the auto industry bailout Bolstered by a new poll that shows him leading in Ohio and two other battleground states, President Barack Obama on Wednesday made his ninth campaign trip this year to the Buckeye State to attack Republican rival Mitt Romney\u2019s tax plan as unfair to middle-class Americans. In Ohio, swing state politics have real-life impact Obama cited a report issued Wednesday by the Urban Institute-Brookings Institution Tax Policy Center that concluded Romney\u2019s proposals for tax reform would end up providing large tax cuts to the very wealthy while increasing the tax burden on the lower and middle classes. \u201cHe\u2019s asking you to pay more so people like him can get a big tax cut,\u201d Obama told more than 2,000 supporters in Mansfield, the first of two Ohio stops Wednesday.  \u201cWe do not need more tax cuts for folks who are already doing really well.\u201d Rep. Van Hollen on the Bush-era tax cuts Panelists on the Bush-era tax cuts Hayworth: We're trying to help Americans Romney\u2019s campaign challenged the veracity of the study and blamed the president\u2019s economic policies for a still-lagging economy. \u201cPresident Obama continues to tout liberal studies calling for more tax hikes and more government spending,\u201d Romney spokesman Ryan Williams said in a statement. \u201cWe\u2019ve been down that road before \u2013 and it\u2019s led us to 41 straight months of unemployment above 8%.\u201d Earlier, the Romney campaign launched a potentially risky ad challenging the Obama administration\u2019s auto industry bailout, which is credited with saving General Motors and Chrysler. Romney Ohio ad hits Obama over auto bailout With just over three months until the November election, the race has become a contentious struggle to convince voters that the other guy will take the country in the wrong direction. The Quinnipiac University/CBS News/New York Times poll released Wednesday showed Obama leading Romney in Ohio, Florida and Pennsylvania, all of which are among the eight or so battleground states vital to either candidate\u2019s chances for winning. Poll: Obama over 50% in Florida, Ohio and Pennsylvania According to the survey, Obama holds a 50%-44% lead in Ohio and a 51%-45% lead in Florida, which are considered toss-ups in November. The president is ahead 53%-42% in Pennsylvania, which is rated \u201cleans Obama\u201d on the CNN Electoral Map. \u201cIf today were November 6, President Barack Obama would sweep the key swing states of Florida, Ohio and Pennsylvania and \u2013 if history is any guide \u2013 into a second term in the Oval Office,\u201d wrote Peter A. Brown, assistant director of the Quinnipiac University Polling Institute, in a statement accompanying the survey\u2019s release. In a key finding that signaled possible trouble for Romney, the candidates were statistically even in all three states on the question of who would better handle the economy. Romney\u2019s main campaign theme is that he is more experienced and better able to bring economic growth than Obama, and his attacks on the president\u2019s economic policies have been relentless. Despite those attacks and unemployment above 8%, Obama is neck-and-neck with the former Massachusetts governor on the issue cited by voters as the most important to them. Wendy Schiller, a political science professor at Brown University, said before Wednesday\u2019s poll came out that the Romney campaign is \u201cbetting on economic dissatisfaction\u201d to defeat Obama. \u201cIf that were true, Obama\u2019s negatives would be much worse,\u201d Schiller said. \u201cThere\u2019s obviously something else driving people\u2019s support other than the economy.\u201d Obama\u2019s visit to Ohio showed the importance his campaign places on the state he won in 2008 over Republican candidate Sen. John McCain. At events in Mansfield and Akron, Obama delivered a modified version of his usual stump speech emphasizing the need to restore the American dream of equal opportunity for all willing to work for it, adding a section on the report by the Tax Policy Center set up by the Urban Institute and the Brookings Institution. Study: Romney tax plan would shift burden toward poor Romney calls for 20% cuts to today\u2019s rates as well as eliminating the Alternative Minimum Tax and limiting current deductions, exemptions and credits available to top-level income earners. However, Romney has yet to say which specific tax breaks he plans to eliminate, and the Tax Policy Center report indicated the result of his plan would force the tax burden to shift toward lower- and middle-class Americans. Tax policy has become a central economic issue, with Congress deadlocked over proposals to extend most or all of the Bush-era tax cuts set to expire at the end of the year. Obama calls for extending the current rates under the tax cuts for income below $250,000 for families and $200,000 for individuals, while letting the rates on income above those figures rise to 1990s levels. \u201cIf you\u2019re fortunate enough to be in the other 2% of Americans, all we\u2019re asking you to do is contribute a little more,\u201d Obama said Wednesday. \u201cThis includes me, by the way.\u201d Romney and Republicans want to extend all the Bush tax cuts for now to prevent any increase, with both sides calling for comprehensive tax reform after the election as part of necessary deficit reduction steps. The issue touches on the foundations of the nation\u2019s political divide, with Republicans driven by their conservative base seeking to shrink government to reduce deficits while Democrats want a blend of spending cuts and more tax revenue in order to maintain what they consider essential services and entitlement programs. In its study, the Tax Policy Center did not score Romney\u2019s plan directly, saying it lacked sufficient details. Instead, the center said Romney\u2019s plan represented a number of Republican proposals. \u201cThey found that if Gov. Romney wants to keep his word and pay for his plan, then he\u2019d have to cut tax breaks that middle-class families depend on,\u201d Obama said, listing mortgage deductions and health care deductions as examples. \u201cThat means the average middle-class family with children would be hit with a tax increase of more than $2,000.\u201d The president made clear that he was relying on the study for the analysis and details, saying, \u201cthis wasn\u2019t my staff; this wasn\u2019t something we did.\u201d \u201cFolks making more than $3 million, the top one-tenth of one percent, would get a tax cut of a quarter of a million a year. Think about that,\u201d Obama said. The Romney campaign argued that the analysis was flawed because it did not account for additional revenue that would result from a reduction in the corporate tax rate \u2013 another part of Romney\u2019s plan. \u201cIgnoring the growth effects of corporate tax reform discredits the Tax Policy Center immediately,\u201d a Romney campaign representative said, adding, \u201cBy not including the substantial growth effects of the corporate side (of) reforms, the entire study is based on flawed assumptions.\u201d Also on Wednesday, the Romney campaign released a television ad that criticized Obama for the auto bailout. Titled \u201cDream,\u201d the spot features Al Zarzour, a car dealership owner from Lyndhurst, Ohio, saying that under the bailout measure, \u201cthe dream \u2026 that we worked so hard for was gone.\u201d \u201cI received a letter from General Motors. They were suspending my credit line. We had 30-some employees that were out of work,\u201d Zarzour says in the spot. Romney has argued the bailout was not the best solution to right the then-struggling auto industry, instead advocating a \u201cmanaged bankruptcy\u201d process that he said is what ultimately happened. Jen Psaki, a spokeswoman for the Obama campaign, said the Romney ad was surprising, adding that the president\u2019s actions on the auto industry saved 2,200 dealership jobs in Ohio alone. Obama\u2019s campaign has also aired advertisements focused on the auto industry bailout, including one in which an autoworker explains how the bailout helped him. Romney and the Republican National Committee have paid $8.2 million for a week of ad time in eight battleground states, which a Republican source who tracks ad buys called the largest amount spent on behalf of Romney so far in the general election media campaign. Romney, RNC make largest weekly ad buy Last week, the RNC started spending some of the funds it is allowed to use to coordinate with the Romney campaign. This allows Romney\u2019s campaign to avoid spending some of its money but stay on the air as the candidate faces millions of dollars of ads from the Obama re-election campaign. Romney campaign officials have routinely refused to discuss the specifics of its ad spending or where its commercials are running. According to CNN\u2019s ad consultant Campaign Media Analysis Group/Kantar Media, the Romney ad talking about layoffs in the car industry is running in Ohio while a new biography spot with Romney touting his business background is up in Iowa. The Obama campaign and the Democratic National Committee, which started coordinating ad spending last week as well, bought $5.3 million of ad time in the same eight states between July 21 and August 3, and a separate $3.5 million for commercials running for a week ending August 2. Another new Romney ad Wednesday hammered Obama over unemployment and other economic problems, saying: \u201cAmericans need a change. We need a new president.\u201d Obama\u2019s campaign responded to the ad by citing Romney\u2019s opposition to the auto industry bailout. \u201cLet\u2019s get this straight \u2013 the very person who argued for the U.S. auto industry to go bankrupt, something that would have caused more than a million jobs lost and utter economic devastation in the Midwest, is now trying to attack the president on how it was handled?\u201d campaign spokeswoman Lis Smith said in a written statement.

            "article_content": "Economy is improving, but many still not better off in Ohio President Obama makes his ninth trip to Ohio this year Race for White House will be fought on the county level The Akron warehouse is bustling with activity: Forklifts buzzing across the floor. Boxes stacked neatly by the loading area. Vans lined side by side to take deliveries. CEO Daniel Flowers shows it all off with a clear sense of pride and accomplishment. He just wishes he wasn\u2019t so busy. Yes, a CEO who wishes supply outpaced demand. \u201cWe have had a steady increase in the number of people who seek emergency food assistance,\u201d Flowers tells a visitor. It is impossible not to be impressed by the operation. Flowers is president and CEO of the Akron-Canton Regional Food Bank, which now operates out of what once was a beer distributorship. It is also impossible not to be numbed by the numbers: More than 2 million people in Ohio \u2013 18% of the state population \u2013 face what the government terms food insecurity. That means they go hungry or are not able to maintain normal and consistent eating patterns because they cant afford it. Poll: Obama leads in Ohio, swing states, tops 50% The Akron-Canton facility serves eight counties and reaches about 180,000 people. Strikingly, about 45% of those who get help don\u2019t qualify for government assistance because they work and don\u2019t meet government income guidelines, but they still don\u2019t make enough money to make ends meet. Akron is in Ohio\u2019s Summit County, a blue-collar battleground within perhaps the 2012 campaign\u2019s defining battleground state. The experience of the food bank \u2013 and the charities it helps \u2013 mirror the campaign economic debate: Are things better off than they were when President Barack Obama took office in 2009? Flowers said demand at the food bank is higher than ever, which could be seen as evidence that things have not gotten better in this swing state. But, one could look at it this way: back in 2008 and 2009, demand grew 25% from year to year. This year it is up 3% from last year. \u201cIt is almost a sad fact that that feels like a win \u2013 that it is not so bad,\u201d Flowers told CNN during a visit on Tuesday \u2013 just 98 days, or 14 weeks, until the November election. Obama's first foreign tour vs. Romney's Romney team: Overseas trip 'a success' Gingrich: Romney 'culture' comment okay Obama is returning to the area Wednesday \u2013 his ninth campaign visit to Ohio this year \u2013 and his team can make a statistical case that the state is in better shape. In Summit County, for example, the unemployment rate is 7% \u2013 down from 9.3% when the president took office. Republicans argue GOP Gov. John Kasich deserves credit more than the Democratic president, but their bigger push is to make the case the recovery would be stronger if not for an administration they say stifles job creation with regulation and new mandates like the Obama health care law. \u201cThe president\u2019s not only demonstrated that he tends toward more of a government-oriented solution toward the economy, but Gov. Romney has proven firsthand he knows how to create jobs,\u201d state Sen. Frank LaRose told CNN during a visit to a Mitt Romney campaign Summit County office in Stow, where a dozen GOP volunteers were making voter calls. The strategy of the swing states Ohio is a fascinating county-by-county chess game. Republicans don\u2019t expect to carry Summit County, for example, but Romney won\u2019t have a prayer statewide unless he improves on Sen. John McCain\u2019s weak 41% performance here in 2008. With so much TV ad money being spent here, LaRose argues there will be a \u201csaturation point,\u201d and that Ohio in the end will be decided on the strength of grassroots organizing. \u201cIn \u201908, that enthusiasm wasn\u2019t there as much as it could have been,\u201d LaRose said. \u201cI get calls all the time from people that say, \u2018What can I do to help Romney win?\u2019\u201d And what does he say to those turned off by the already nasty campaign? \u201cI tell them that\u2019s like saying, \u2018I don\u2019t get involved in the weather.\u2019 It\u2019s going to effect you.\u201d The president\u2019s recent \u201cyou didn\u2019t build it\u201d remark that the Romney campaign characterizes as an insult to entrepreneurs and small businesses plays heavily in the GOP strategy now. Pawlenty: \u2018Obama is all foam and no beer\u2019 Ohio is full of small towns and medium-sized cities \u2013 like Akron and Dayton \u2013 where Romney and his surrogates make the case that remark, and the Obama record, prove the president sees government as a stronger force than the private sector. Most Republicans here push for Ohio GOP Sen. Rob Portman to share the ticket with Romney. But former Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty had an Ohio audition of sorts while the candidate was overseas this week. At the Dublin Pub in Dayton, Pawlenty drew laughter when he asked patrons how they would feel if the owner promised a cold beer then served them a glass of foam, and then added: \u201cPresident Obama is all foam and no beer.\u201d Turning more serious, he said government was choking business expansion with regulation while also running up huge deficits. \u201cThe hour is later than people realize,\u201d Pawlenty said. Dayton is another critical piece of the puzzle \u2013 and another area Team Obama can cite some progress. Unemployment was 11.1% in the county in February 2009; it is 8.1% now. County by county analysis Again, Montgomery County \u2013 home of Dayton \u2013 is a key test of Romney\u2019s Ohio viability. President George W. Bush essentially split the vote with Democratic challenger John Kerry here in 2004 - the Democrat had a slight 51% to 49% edge. Obama, on the other hand, beat McCain 53% to 46% here \u2013 one of the many swing counties key to the big Democratic 2008 Ohio edge. Hamilton County \u2013 the Cincinnati area \u2013 was the surprise piece of Obama\u2019s 2008 Ohio rout. Look at a 2008 map and it is shaded blue \u2013 carried by Obama. Look at the close 2000 and 2004 races, when Ohio was carried both times by Bush, and Hamilton County is shaded red for Republican. \u201cI think Hamilton County is the key to winning Ohio, and winning Ohio is the key to the president\u2019s re-election,\u201d the county Democratic chairman Tim Burke said in an interview at his Cincinnati law office.African-American turnout was critical to Obama\u2019s Hamilton County win four years ago, and Burke says the campaign and state party are increasing field staff and other resources to prove wrong those who believe that turnout among that voting bloc will slip some this year. He also predicted Kasich\u2019s clashes with organized labor will benefit the president in November.\u201dSome of the more conservative unions \u2013 like the police and fire unions \u2013 which have trended toward the Republicans, they\u2019re back in the Democratic camp, and they\u2019re going to be there in the fall,\u201d Burke said. Jobs rate, auto industry improving In Burke\u2019s view, recent improvement in Ohio\u2019s jobless numbers will make it harder for Romney and the GOP to win the \u201cAre you better off?\u201d debate in this state. \u201cJust take the auto industry and how that has seen a resurgence in the state of Ohio,\u201d Burke said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got three quarters of a million jobs that are auto related here in Ohio, and we are seeing the benefits of that for President Obama.\u201d Some, though, have a different test than the unemployment rate. George Camilletti is at the Akron food bank four or five days a week for five years now, packing his wife\u2019s minivan with supplies for the Good Neighbors charity. Five years watching the changing face of hunger and struggle \u2013 watching economic anxiety spread to folks who had never experienced chronic unemployment or hunger. \u201cI think it is worse than three years ago,\u201d Camilletti says. \u201cIt is migrating. \u2026 I\u2019d say we are going into the middle of the middle class now. We are reaching up to the suburban people. To people who used to have a nice home, a nice car. \u2026It is worse than it was three years ago.\u201d Better or worse: The defining question in what could well be the defining battleground.",

            "article_content": "Republican bill to extend tax cuts expected to pass along party lines in the House Obama: If Republicans don't negotiate, they will be responsible for tax hike Republicans: Tax hike on top 2% could kill 700,000 jobs Both sides will use the vote to try to gain the upper hand on the campaign trail Republicans and Democrats on Capitol Hill are gearing up for a vote this week on a House Republican bill to extend all the current tax cuts, but the debate is really aimed at the vote that comes less than 100 days from now. The GOP bill is expected to pass narrowly, mostly along party lines. But both political parties are using Congress\u2019 big fight over taxes to frame voters\u2019 choice in the November election. GOP leaders\u2019 message is that anything short of renewing all the current tax rates amounts to a massive tax increase on small businesses and undercuts the economic recovery. Democrats say Republicans are holding tax breaks for the middle class hostage over cuts for less than 2% of American taxpayers. Last week the Senate narrowly passed a bill pushed by Democrats and the White House that extends tax breaks for those families making $250,000 and under, or individuals earning $200,000 or less, but allow the cuts for upper-income Americans to expire at the end of the year. On Thursday, President Barack Obama, fresh off the win in the Senate, joined top Hill Democrats in pressing House Republicans for a vote on that bill, saying they\u2019ll be responsible for a tax increase for all Americans. Senate passes Democratic tax plan, rejects GOP version \u201cWe need 218 votes in the House of Representatives \u2013 218 votes in the House of Representatives \u2013 to make sure that 98% of Americans don\u2019t see their taxes go up,\u201d Obama told reporters after meeting with his Cabinet. To keep up the pressure, top administration officials will fan out around the country to push for the vote, the president said. House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, dismissed the Senate vote and calls from Democrats to pass that bill without delay. He challenged the president to drop his opposition to tax breaks for upper-income levels, saying letting them expire would only mean the weak economy would suffer more job losses. \u201cMr. President, I\u2019ll tell you what \u2013 if you want to show that you stand with American small business owners, the best thing you can do is drop your plan to increase their taxes on January 1. This small business tax hike, according to Ernst & Young, will destroy more than 700,000 jobs,\u201d Boehner said Thursday. Bush tax cuts: What you\u2019d pay under rival plans Led by House GOP Whip Kevin McCarthy of California, rank-and-file House Republicans plan to carry that message across the country in the days before this week\u2019s House vote. GOP members will meet with small business owners and constituents in more than 25 \u201cStop the Tax Hike\u201d events across the country. Members of Congress, Republicans challenging Democrats for other congressional seats and aides have already launched their campaign to get the word out on social media, using the \u201c#StopTheTaxHike\u201d hash tag on Twitter. House Democrats are ready for the fight \u2013 and this time they welcome it. Recent debates over tax rates have proven to be politically tricky terrain for congressional Democrats.  Some Democratic aides and members admit that previous debates on taxes left them on the defense. Republicans were able to effectively paint the GOP as the party that fights to keep taxes low, while tagging Democrats as champions of tax increases. After suffering major losses at polls in the 2010 election, House Democrats were split on a last-minute deal that President Obama cut with Republicans to extend all the so-called \u201cBush-era\u201d tax cuts for two years during the lame duck session. Ilinois Republican Rep. Peter Roskam argued Friday that the \u201conly thing that\u2019s changed is that the economy has gotten softer not better.\u201d Opinion: Taxmageddon is headed our way Roskam, the GOP\u2019s deputy whip, predicted some Democrats would support the GOP plan. \u201cMy feeling is that there are a lot of Democrats who are not interested in walking the plank on some symbolic roll call to show unanimity with the president, who right now is challenging whether entrepreneurs have created their own company.\u201d Pelosi called Democratic support for that bill \u201ca one-time thing\u201d and argued last week that her party only supported the extension of tax breaks for higher income earners then as a price for extending unemployment benefits that were about to expire. Two years later Democrats insist they are the ones on offense, expressing confidence that this time it\u2019s Republicans who stand to lose. Like the GOP, they have their campaign ready.  Leadership aides designed their own new media efforts \u2013 sending messaging packets to members that include \u201csample tweets\u201d (using \u201c#middleclasstaxcuts\u201d as their hash tag) and \u201csample Facebook posts.\u201d  The Democratic talking points center on their message that the GOP is holding middle-class tax cuts hostage for tax breaks for the ultrarich in the top 2%.  Colorful charts and graphs show how many middle-class families would see their tax burden go up if Congress fails to act. The chief of the House Democrats campaign committee, Rep Steve Israel, D-New York, sent a memo to all his candidates arguing that voters believe Republicans are on \u201cthe wrong side of this issue.\u201d   The memo cites recent polls by Pew and National Journal that show the independent voters \u2013 who will be key this fall \u2013 believe allowing the tax breaks for wealthier Americans to lapse won\u2019t have a major impact on the economy. Opinion: Hardworking Americans should not be living in poverty \u201cBy going on offense and proactively framing this debate, you will make clear to voters in your district that you are fighting for the middle class, in contrast to your Republican opponent who is again standing up for the wrong priorities: more tax breaks for millionaires, Big Oil and companies shipping jobs overseas, at the expense of the middle class.\u201d the memo states. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee also announced it will hold events in advance of the vote in 15 competitive Congressional districts dubbed \u201cMiddle Class First.\u201d   Democratic activists will make calls and go door to door in these critical electoral battlegrounds to highlight their opposition to the House GOP bill. Despite Israel\u2019s advice, Arizona Democratic Rep Ron Barber, who just won a special election last month, said he\u2019s undecided on how he\u2019ll vote.  He\u2019s likely to face another tough race this fall. \u201cI have to see what the impact would be on people back home and then I\u2019ll know better what my answer is going to be on the bill,\u201d Barber said, saying he and his staff were still evaluating the impact on small businesses and middle-class taxpayers. But McCarthy, a former small business owner who ran a string of deli shops in California before running for Congress, zeroed in on the GOP argument he hopes will trip up Democrats worried about the economy in tight races around the country: Renewing tax cuts for only those making $250,000 and under will hurt small businesses. McCarthy told reporters last week, \u201cSmall business is the biggest job creator in America, more so than corporations. Take the measurement from the last recession to the current one; they have created 7 million jobs and big corporations cut 1 million.\u201d But Democrats believe this time the debate is framed in a way that helps them.  Rep Chris Van Hollen, the top Democrat on the House Budget Committee, says voters now see the choice between the GOP and Democratic tax proposals as a matter of trade-offs, and are more aware now about how the cost of keeping all the tax breaks will add to the nation\u2019s budget deficit. Van Hollen pointed to the debates over the GOP plan, which he labeled the \u201cRomney-Ryan-Republican budget,\u201d the House-passed budget written by GOP Budget Chairman Paul Ryan that Republican presidential candidate Mitt Romney has endorsed. Van Hollen said Democrats are stressing \u201cthe price of giving tax breaks to the wealthy \u2013 the price is paid by seniors on Medicare paying more and education for our kids getting less.  It\u2019s a much sharper message.\u201d Foreshadowing the likely political attack from the GOP, McCarthy reminded reporters on Friday that many House Democrats are already on record voting to extend all tax breaks in 2010. \u201cYou\u2019re going to have 89 current members of the Democratic party who voted to extend the tax cuts last time who are going to have to answer why they are flip-flopping with a bad economy,\u201d he said.

            "article_content": "NEW: Executive order establishes African-American higher education initiative NEW: Higher education \"is a vital necessity\" that should be affordable, Obama says NEW: Obama has \"disappointed\" black Americans on economy, Romney spokeswoman says A report says a drop in African-American turnout could cost Obama in three key states President Barack Obama on Wednesday announced an initiative he said will give African-American students greater access \u201cto a complete and competitive education from the time they\u2019re born all through the time they get a career.\u201d Speaking Wednesday night at a National Urban League gathering in New Orleans, Obama said he has issued an executive order establishing the White House Initiative on Educational Excellence for African Americans, saying, \u201cA higher education in a 21st century cannot be a luxury. It is a vital necessity that every American should be able to afford,\u201d he said. He added that his administration is \u201cpushing all colleges and universities\u201d to cut their costs. The president focused the bulk of his comments on the economy, saying his tax policies and economic plans aim to boost the middle class. \u201cWe also believe that every entrepreneur should have a chance to start a business, no matter who you are, no matter what you look like,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019ve helped African-American businesses and minority-owned businesses and women-owned businesses gain access to more than $7 billion in contracts and financing that allow them to grow and create jobs.\u201d A spokeswoman for presumptive Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney responded to the speech, saying Obama has \u201cdisappointed\u201d African-Americans with his performance on the economy. \u201cAs black Americans, we all take pride in Barack Obama\u2019s historic election,\u201d said Tara Wall, senior communications and coalition adviser for the Romney campaign, \u201cbut unfortunately his performance as president has not matched that enthusiasm. He\u2019s disappointed black small business owners, failed to address rising black unemployment \u2013 which now stands at over 14%, and is double that among our youth \u2013 and failed to address the widening economic disparity gap.\u201d Obama\u2019s executive order comes in the wake of a new report by the National Urban League\u2019s Policy Institute that warned the president could lose three key battleground states \u2013 Virginia, North Carolina and Ohio \u2013 if African-American voters don\u2019t match their strong turnout of 2008 in this year\u2019s election. \u201cAfrican-American voters tipped the outcome of the 2008 presidential election in several key states, and are poised to do so again in 2012,\u201d said the report, titled \u201cThe Hidden Swing Voters: Impact of African-Americans in 2012\u201d by Madura Wijewardena and Valerie Wilson. \u201cHow this will manifest will depend on many things, but one important factor will be whether the extraordinary growth in turnout by African-American voters in 2008 will be replicated in 2012,\u201d the report continued. \u201cThe 2008 voter turnout rate was driven by historic factors that may not necessarily apply in 2012.\u201d The \u201chistoric factors\u201d reference was to Obama being the nation\u2019s first African-American nominee of a major party, with voters having the opportunity in 2008 to make him the nation\u2019s first African-American president. This time, an economy struggling to recover from a recession that hit African-Americans particularly hard has raised questions about whether Obama supporters will have the same fervor as they did four years ago. A recent Gallup Poll showed the president with overwhelming support among registered African-American voters, with backing of 89%, compared with 5% for certain Republican nominee Mitt Romney. In 2008, Obama won 95% of the African-American vote, with 4% voting for GOP candidate John McCain. About 2 million more African-Americans voted in the 2008 election than in 2004, according to U.S. Census Bureau figures. Voting by all minority groups accounted for nearly all the increase in turnout (5 million) between the two election cycles, as white non-Hispanic voting was virtually unchanged, the Census Bureau reported. A decline in African-American voter turnout to the 2004 level of 60% from the 2008 level of 64.7% would cause Obama to lose in North Carolina and possibly lose in Ohio and Virginia, according to the National Urban League Policy Institute report. Obama won all three states in 2008, and most scenarios for Obama\u2019s re-election depend on him winning at least two of them this time. Ohio has 18 electoral votes, while North Carolina has 15 and Virginia has 13. A fierce start to the election campaign, with the candidates and their supporting super PACs launching bitter attacks, has made ensuring enthusiastic backing from traditional support bases a key to victory in November. The president\u2019s speech Wednesday concluded a four-day, six-state swing that started earlier than planned Sunday so he could visit Aurora, Colorado, after last week\u2019s mass shooting at a movie theater. During the speech, Obama made some of the most forceful statements of his presidency on the issue of gun violence, saying that while he respects the nation\u2019s hunting and gun-owning traditions, \u201cWe should leave no stone unturned and recognize that we have no greater mission as a country than keeping our young people safe.\u201d CNN\u2019s Lesa Jansen, Tom Cohen and Paul Steinhauser contributed to this report.",

The Democratic proposal passed in a sharply polarized 51-48 vote, while the Republican plan was defeated 45-54. Vice President Joe Biden, the constitutional presiding officer of the Senate, was on hand to cast a tie-breaking vote if necessary. Strategists on both sides of the aisle acknowledge that neither plan has a chance of passing both the Democratic-controlled Senate and the Republican-controlled House of Representatives. GOP leaders in the House have indicated they have no intention of bringing the Democrats\u2019 plan to a vote. House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, pledged in a written statement after the votes to \u201cstop the tax hike,\u201d and insisted Republicans are the only ones addressing the \u201cthreat to our economy.\u201d Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus blasted Democrats for backing a \u201cdisastrous plan to raise taxes on small businesses and job creators\u201d while putting \u201ctheir tax-and-spend agenda ahead of creating jobs.\u201d President Barack Obama, however, said, \u201cHouse Republicans are now the only people left in Washington holding hostage the middle-class tax cuts for 98% of Americans.\u201d The U.S. economy \u201cisn\u2019t built from the top down, it\u2019s built from a strong and growing middle class, and that\u2019s who we should be fighting for,\u201d he declared. Lee: Congress should extend tax cuts Sen. Blumenthal: Extend tax cuts Rival Bush tax plans Wednesday\u2019s votes were primarily about political positioning in the heat of the 2012 election season, as well each party\u2019s opening bid in what is sure to be a frenzied legislative negotiating session this autumn. The economy is approaching a so-called \u201cfiscal cliff\u201d brought on by the looming expiration of several tax cuts as well as the approach of a series of mandatory spending cuts. \u201cAt the end of the day this (legislative maneuvering) isn\u2019t going to solve the problem. It\u2019s going to be political posturing all the way up to the November election,\u201d said Sen. Bill Nelson, D-Florida. The Democratic bill approved by the Senate on Wednesday would extend the Bush tax cuts \u2013 now set to expire at the end of the year \u2013 just on incomes under $250,000 for a couple and $200,000 for an individual. The GOP bill would extend the tax cuts for all taxpayers \u2013 including the wealthiest Americans \u2013 and includes a requirement that Congress tackle comprehensive tax reform within a year. Republicans argue that any tax hikes could derail what is already considered a weak recovery. Opinion: Taxmageddon is headed our way After Senate leaders jockeyed for days over procedural issues tied to consideration of the bills, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, unexpectedly announced Wednesday morning that Republicans would agree to Democratic demands and hold back-to-back votes requiring neither side to garner a filibuster-proof 60-vote margin. McConnell\u2019s decision gave the Democrats bragging rights, allowing them to tout the fact that their bill is capable of passing the Senate. But it also gave Republicans the ability to put several centrist Democratic senators on the spot, forcing those Democrats to vote for a politically contentious plan that raises taxes on certain Americans. \u201cWe owe it to the American people to let them know whether we actually think it is a good idea to double down on the failed economic policies of the past few years or whether we support a new approach,\u201d McConnell said before the vote. \u201cBy setting these votes at a 50-vote threshold, nobody on the other side can hide behind a procedural vote while leaving their views on the actual bill itself a mystery.\u201d For their part, Democrats point to polling that shows a majority of Americans support their approach. \u201cOur bill has the support of President Obama, has the support of the Democratic caucus and has the support of the American people. A majority of Americans, including a significant majority of Republicans, agree taxes should remain low for the middle class and the top 2% should pay their fair share to reduce the deficit,\u201d said Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada. \u201cThe only place there is no agreement is with Republicans in Congress.\u201d Want to attend one of the political conventions?

            "article_content": "GOP filibuster blocks DISCLOSE Act again The Democratic bill would require certain groups to disclose names of high-paying donors Republicans argue it favors labor unions over other types of donors The legislation failed in a Monday vote, 51-44 Senate Republicans again Tuesday blocked Democratic legislation that would require greater transparency into who is behind much of the secretive, often negative campaign advertising filling the airwaves this election season. Supporters of the DISCLOSE Act mustered 53 votes in an effort to advance the bill, but fell short of the 60 needed to break a GOP filibuster. Democrats unanimously supported the bill, while Republicans voted unanimously against it. The legislation, which needs 60 votes to succeed, failed on a 51-44 vote Monday. The legislation would require certain tax-exempt groups involved in political advertising \u2013 which currently are not required to disclose the names of their donors  \u2013 to release the names of those who give donations of $10,000 or more. A similar vote Monday ended with the same result. \u201cDuring this election, outside spending by GOP shell groups is expected to top $1 billion,\u201d said Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, in a floor speech.  \u201cThe names of these front groups contain words like \u2018freedom\u2019 and \u2018prosperity.\u2019  But make no mistake: there is nothing free about an election purchased by a handful of billionaires for their own self-interest.\u201d Read Reid\u2019s prepared statement Democrats say the requirement is a much-needed response to the U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s Citizen United decision, which opened the doors to large amounts of campaign spending by corporations, labor unions and other groups. The political advertising all those donations buy \u201cthreatens to drown out the voice of middle-class families in our democracy,\u201d argued Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse, D-Rhode Island, a chief sponsor of the bill. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, led the GOP charge against the bill and accused Democrats of crafting it to favor labor unions \u2013 traditionally Democratic allies \u2013 over other types of donors. Read McConnell\u2019s statement \u201cThis legislation is an unprecedented requirement for groups to publicly disclose their donors, stripping a protection recognized and solidified by the courts,\u201d said McConnell, who has advocated for more disclosure in the past so long as it applies to all big players in campaign financing, such as labor unions and trial lawyers. McConnell cited a recent Wall Street Journal analysis that found labor unions spent $4.4 billion on campaigns between 2005 and 2011. Obama picks up campaign cash in the Lone Star State \u201cPredictably, unions are exempted from the kind of disclosure Democrats now want to impose on others,\u201d McConnell said. Democrats disagreed with the Republicans\u2019 assertion that labor unions are exempt from their legislation.  However, the concern about labor unions appeared to sway key Republicans such as Sen. John McCain of Arizona, a longtime vocal advocate of campaign finance reform, who said he would vote against the bill for that reason. Read McCain\u2019s full remarks \u201cBy conveniently setting high threshold for reporting requirements, the DISCLOSE Act forces some entities to inform the public about the origins of their financial support, while allowing others \u2013 most notably those affiliated with organized labor \u2013 to fly beneath the Federal Election Commission\u2019s regulatory radar,\u201d McCain said. McCain argued that local union chapters would not have to disclose payments from individual members if the amount was less than $10,000.

            "article_content": "Parallel political universes reflect the deep partisan divide The health care debate shows how the two sides talk past each other Analyst: \"It's worse now than it's been in years\" The result is competing claims that confuse voters Even in an election year, the current dysfunction in Washington reflects a worsening partisan divide that has created what amounts to parallel political universes seemingly unable to comprehend or deal with each other. In one, President Barack Obama and Democrats battle Republican obstruction that they say stunts their plans for economic recovery and advancing equal opportunity for all Americans. In the other, Republicans fight to restore conservative principles of free markets and less government through what they call common-sense proposals rejected by Democrats. With less than four months until the November election, the dueling realities will only become more starkly divided. \u201cIt\u2019s worse now than it\u2019s been in years,\u201d said Darrell West, the vice president and director of governance studies at the Brookings Institution. \u201cOur leaders are deeply polarized, and \u2018compromise\u2019 has become a dirty word.\u201d Instead of negotiating, West continued, political leaders \u201care talking past one another because they are playing to their particular base.\u201d Bipartisanship OK in Massachusetts Senate race \u201cThey seem less interested in actually solving problems than in presenting some doctrinaire view that\u2019s not getting anything done,\u201d he said, adding: \u201cWe now have parallel political universes that don\u2019t connect to one another, and it leaves voters confused.\u201d House GOP repeals Obamacare -- again Tax cuts, outsourcing on campaign trail Romney gets booed during NAACP speech This week has brought further evidence of the polarization. Democrats and Republicans continued to squabble over whether to extend some or all of the Bush tax cuts from 2001 and 2003 in a legislative dance involving competing proposals but little prospect for real progress. Tax-cut fight could derail small-business bill Meanwhile, a House debate on a GOP measure to repeal Obama\u2019s signature health care reform law devolved into opposing claims that caused only confusion and rancor. The House had voted more than 30 times previously on measures to repeal, defund or otherwise undermine the law known as Obamacare, so any arguments for or against the latest repeal effort were well-known. Nevertheless, those arguments were repeated over and over in debate Tuesday and Wednesday. Another day, another repeal vote Republicans railed against what they called socialized medicine and called the health care law the biggest tax increase in U.S. history, a claim rejected by the independent website Factcheck.org. \u201cThere\u2019s no way the (law\u2019s) tax and other revenue increases come close to being the largest in U.S. history,\u201d according to a Factcheck.org posting. Democrats say a giant public pressure campaign by insurance companies and conservative groups during the debate on the health care bill in 2009 and 2010 created a false narrative that persists today. \u201cThey spent over $200 million mischaracterizing the bill, saying that it was public funding for abortions, which it was not, and is not; saying it was death panels, which it was not, and isn\u2019t,\u201d House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-California, told reporters Wednesday. A review of Factcheck.org and Politifact.com, another nonpartisan website, shows both sides have been guilty of false statements about the health care law. For example, it labeled false the claim by Pelosi that under the health care law, \u201ceverybody will have lower rates, better quality care and better access.\u201d Politifact also cited as false a statement by certain GOP presidential nominee Mitt Romney that Obamacare \u201cputs the federal government between you and your doctor.\u201d The result of such dubious claims is that voters \u201cdon\u2019t know which facts are true and which ones have been made up,\u201d West said. Voters tired of health care debate A recent CNN/ORC International poll reflected such public confusion on the health care issue. The survey conducted June 28-July 1 showed 52% of respondents favor all or most provisions of the health care law, while at the same time, 51% want Congress to repeal the entire measure. On both issues, Democrats were strongly in favor of keeping the law intact while Republicans were equally supportive of repealing or dismantling it. Independents reflected the conflicting findings of the poll, with 56% favoring repeal while 51% support all or most of the law\u2019s provisions. To West, a Republican shift \u201cfar to the right\u201d has made finding common ground in the political center \u201cvery difficult.\u201d He also said the news media contribute to the problem because news reports \u201creinforce political polarization and hyper-partisanship.\u201d \u201cThe media encourage shouting, as opposed to problem-solving,\u201d West added. The renewed tax cut debate has been another example of a complex issue reduced to political posturing. iReporters go toe-to-toe on jobs After the weak June jobs report Friday, Obama chose Monday to revive his call to hold down tax rates for a year on income below $250,000 for families and $200,000 for individuals while letting the rates return to higher 1990s levels for the rest. He and Democrats contend the nation needs the additional revenue from ending the tax cuts on the rest, while the middle class needs continued help coping with the sluggish recovery. The problem, Obama says in his campaign stump speech, is that Republicans refuse to consider any kind of tax hike, even for millionaires who can easily handle it. Republicans want to maintain the lower rates of the Bush tax cuts for everyone for a year, arguing that raising anyone\u2019s taxes in a weak economy will harm any chance for stronger recovery. They also oppose increased taxes on grounds that government needs to shrink, rather than receive more revenue that would allow it to keep growing. Both parties say the ultimate goal is comprehensive tax reform to settle a dispute at the center of deficit reduction talks throughout the Obama presidency. However, when Senate Republicans called for an immediate vote Wednesday on each side\u2019s proposal, Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, said no. A Democratic leadership aide said the delay was to prolong the tax cut debate through July, but another reason may be the difficulty Reid faces in holding together his caucus to support Obama\u2019s plan. Some Senate Democrats propose that the cutoff for extending lower tax rates should be $1 million in order to restrict higher taxes to the most wealthy, while backing the president could be difficult for those facing tough re-election battles.

            "article_content": "Romney now says health care mandate is a tax but only federally Conflicting messages, staff frustrate some high powered supporters Democrats rush to paint Romney as a flip flopper Voters unlikely to care about confusing legal jargon on health care Mitt Romney\u2019s course correction on whether the health care mandate is a tax puts him in line with Republicans who have pinned hopes for winning down-ballot races in part on hammering President Barack Obama for imposing what they\u2019ve called the biggest tax in the nation\u2019s history. But amid criticism of Romney\u2019s campaign as muddled and clumsy, the messaging shift could also cement Romney\u2019s image as a flip-flopper, political experts say. \u201cIf Romney pushes hard the same meme the GOP leaders are pushing, he looks like a complete flip-flopper,\u201d Norm Ornstein, a veteran political analyst and author of \u201cIt\u2019s Even Worse Than It Looks: How the American Constitutional System Collided with the New Politics of Extremism,\u201d said before Romney revealed his position in interviews on Wednesday. \u201cHe\u2019d rather now have the health issue fade. This is not helpful to him.\u201d It\u2019s exactly the kind of criticism former Republican presidential rival Rick Santorum lobbed at Romney during the primaries. \u201cHe glosses over and doesn\u2019t even tell the truth\u2026,\u201d Santorum said of Romney during a forum in Troy, Michigan, on February 25. \u201cHere is a guy who is the ultimate flip-flopper running for president, and he\u2019s attacking me for not being principled? That doesn\u2019t wash.\u201d In the wake of the Supreme Court\u2019s upholding Obama\u2019s health care reform law last week on the basis that Congress has the power to collect taxes, Romney said he disagreed with the majority opinion of the court, but he said the decision affirmed that Obama had broken a promise not to impose more taxes on the middle class. On Monday, top Romney campaign adviser Eric Fehrnstrom said that Romney didn\u2019t believe the mandate was a tax. Two days later at a Fourth of July event, Romney said the Supreme Court ruled the mandate is a tax and it had the final word. But he also said of a similar provision in Massachusetts, where he signed a similar health care reform measure into law as governor, the mandate wasn\u2019t so much a tax as a penalty. With polls showing most Americans\u2019 minds are made up on the health care law, experts also question whether an argument over an arcane point of law that confuses most people is a winning strategy or lost on most. \u201cI think this \u2018tax-vs.-penalty\u2019 debate must be really exciting and interesting for law students, professors and lawyers but is just semantical BS for everyone else,\u201d said Charlie Cook, editor of the nonpartisan Cook Political Report. In the politics of perception, Romney\u2019s semantics gymnastics is landing flat. \u201cThe Romney high command has muddied the tax issue in a way that will help Mr. Obama\u2019s claims that he is merely taxing rich folks like Mr. Romney. And it has made it that much harder for Republicans to again turn Obamacare into the winning issue it was in 2010,\u201d the Wall Street Journal wrote Thursday in a scathing editorial which took Romney to task for squandering his shot at the White House by not disavowing \u201chis faulty health-care legacy in Massachusetts.\u201d Rupert Murdoch, CEO of NewsCorp, which publishes the Wall Street Journal and owns Fox News, was similarly unimpressed. \u201cMet Romney last week. Tough O Chicago pros will be hard to beat unless he drops old friends from team and hires some real pros. Doubtful,\u201d Murdoch tweeted on Sunday, referring to Obama\u2019s Chicago political advisers. The next day he responded to criticism from Romney supporters. \u201cRomney people upset at me! Of course I want him to win, save us from socialism, etc but should listen to good advice and get stuck in!\u201d Former General Electric Chairman Jack Welch weighed in on Twitter with his own worries. \u201cHope Mitt Romney is listening to Murdoch advice on campaign staff..playing in league with Chicago pols..No room for amateurs.\u201d The Romney campaign offered a measured response to the criticism. \u201cGov. Romney respects Rupert Murdoch and also respects his team and has confidence in them,\u201d spokeswoman Andrea Saul wrote Tuesday. The moguls\u2019 public grievances give voice to the fears of some Republicans that Romney\u2019s temperature testing and delayed response on such critical issues as health care add to confusion within the caucus. Romney waited several days to comment on Obama\u2019s announcement that he would defer for two years the deportation of people younger than 30 who came to the country before they turned 16, as long as they weren\u2019t a security threat, were in school or served in the military. \u201cI think most of my members are interested in learning what Gov. Romney has to say about this issue, and we\u2019re going to withhold judgment, most of us, until that time,\u201d Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell told reporters after the policy announcement. Democrats blasted Romney for supporting a student loan interest rate extension when he\u2019d previously backed House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan\u2019s proposed cuts to the federal Pell Grant program. Democrats and progressives are also running with the idea of Romney as flip-flopper. Katrina vanden Heuvel, editor of The Nation and a self-described progressive, tweeted on Thursday that Romney\u2019s  tax messaging makes \u201cthat Etch a Sketch look downright steady, stable and full of integrity,\u201d referring to a statement Fehrnstrom made during the primaries that Romney\u2019s campaign could \u201cshake it up and restart all over again\u201d for the general election after his more conservative GOP rivals had forced him to the right. In either case, the political ping-pong match over whether a tax is a tax or a penalty is likely to go over most voters\u2019 heads, political experts say. \u201cAttitudes toward this law were formed several years ago, the battle lines set, whether people like it or not factored to the pro- and anti-Obama stock prices years ago,\u201d Cook said.  \u201cNone of this matters. No one is listening.\u201d",

            "article_content": "NEW: Mitt Romney's campaign raises over $2.5 million in hours after the ruling Complex ruling a victory for the White House, may also energize Republican base GOP will grab onto view of new \"tax\" and use it to attack President Barack Obama Democrats in Congress feel vindicated, calling ruling historic The U.S. Supreme Court\u2019s narrow upholding of the health care reform law now launches a complex political ballet, with President Barack Obama and Democrats claiming victory and Republicans immediately seizing on the word \u201ctax,\u201d vowing to repeal the law \u201clock, stock and barrel.\u201d In a 5-4 decision, the court upheld the law and found that the so-called individual mandate is constitutional under Congress\u2019 taxing power but not under the commerce clause of the Constitution, as the government originally had argued. Read the opinion (PDF) Republicans \u2013 including presidential candidate Mitt Romney \u2013 claimed the mandate should be seen as a tax increase. Obama had previously rejected the idea that the mandate amounts to a tax. Photos: Health care and the high court Romney lashed out at the ruling and the president, claiming the law\u2019s provisions to impose a penalty on those who aren\u2019t insured amounts to a tax increase. Other parts of the law require individuals making more than $200,000 to pay more into Medicare and imposes an excise tax on high-cost employer health insurance plans if their plan cost tops $10,200 for individual coverage and $27,500 for family coverage. \u201cObamacare raises taxes on the American people by approximately $500 billion,\u201d Romney said Thursday. Chief Justice John Roberts clarified the tax issue in his opinion: \u201cThe Federal Government does not have the power to order people to buy health insurance. (It) would therefore be unconstitutional if read as a command. The Federal Government does have the power to impose a tax on those without health insurance. (It) is therefore constitutional, because it can reasonably be read as a tax.\u201d Other Republicans also latched onto the tax increase refrain. What the health care ruling means to you \u201cHere\u2019s the bottom line now,\u201d said Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Fla. \u201cIt is constitutional according to the Supreme Court because it is a tax increase \u2026 now millions of Americans will have an IRS problem beginning in 2014.\u201d Republicans likely will use the tax argument as a battle cry on the campaign trail as Romney quickly repeated his vow to repeal the law if he is elected president. \u201cWhat the court did not do on its last day of session, I will do on my first day if I am elected president of the United States,\u201d Romney said Thursday. \u201cI will act to repeal Obamacare.\u201d Short-term loss for conservatives? Romney: I'll do what justices didn't Ruling on individual mandate explained How will the court's ruling affect you? For his part, Obama sees his role in the protracted saga as that of a leader willing to take a politically unpopular stand on health care. \u201cI didn\u2019t do this because it\u2019s good politics. I did it because I believed it was good for the country. I did it because I believed it was good for the American people,\u201d Obama said. Obama campaign to opponents: Move past health care fight Later Thursday, in a memo from Democratic officials, the Obama re-election campaign added: \u201cAll three branches of government have now agreed that President Obama\u2019s health care law is the right thing to do\u2026It\u2019s time to move past the same political battles and fully implement the law.\u201d Both sides will now take their case to the American electorate heading into the fall election. Republicans frustrated, Democrats elated On Capitol Hill, Republicans who fought hard against the law\u2019s initial passage were not happy. \u201cThe president of the United States himself, promised up and down that this bill was not a tax,\u201d Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said from the Senate floor. \u201cThis is one of the Democrats\u2019 top selling points because they knew it would not pass if it was a tax. Well, the Supreme Court has spoken \u2013 this law is a tax. The bill was sold to the American people on a deception.\u201d House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, was more blunt. \u201cThe government could decide that we are going to tax you if you don\u2019t eat broccoli on Tuesday,\u201d Boehner said. \u201cApparently now that is constitutional, but I don\u2019t think it is a very wise law.\u201d House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Virginia said he was \u201cdisappointed\u201d in the decision and on his way into a closed door House GOP meeting on the ruling. He said the House will vote after it returns from July Fourth recess to repeal the health care law. How the justices voted, what they wrote Meanwhile, Democrats in Congress were elated. A visibly relieved Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, applauded the decision from the Senate floor. Like Obama, the veteran lawmaker spent enormous political capital marshaling his caucus and pushing the law\u2019s passage. \u201cPassing the Affordable Care Act was the greatest single step in generations toward ensuring access to affordable, quality health care for every person in America regardless of where they live, how much they make,\u201d Reid said Thursday. The key House leader who pushed through the bill in 2010 indicated the court\u2019s ruling was a vindication of months of work. \u201cIn passing health reform, we made history for our nation and progress for the American people. We completed the unfinished business of our society and strengthened the character of our country,\u201d said House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-California, who was House speaker until her party lost the majority in the 2010 midterm elections. \u201cWe ensured health care would be a right for all, not a privilege for the few. Today, the Supreme Court affirmed our progress and protected that right, securing a future of health and economic security for the middle class and for every American.\u201d Opinion: Are voters ready to move on? And the ruling was a much-needed win for a president locked in a tough re-election campaign. \u201cIt is a major part of the president\u2019s potential legacy,\u201d said Andrew Rudalevige, an associate political science professor at Dickinson College and author of \u201cThe New Imperial Presidency: Renewing Presidential Power After Watergate.\u201d \u201cAnd the individual mandate does hold the substance of the package together, costwise and substantively.\u201d A major initiative for a new president When Obama signed the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act into law in 2010, the move heralded a major \u2013 albeit hard-won \u2013 political victory for the president. The controversial legislation, which critics dubbed \u201cObamacare,\u201d extended coverage to 30 million Americans and was the culmination of a drawn-out and deeply partisan fight about the role of government. For Obama, the law\u2019s passage proved his administration\u2019s ability to push through its policy agenda despite strong oppositional headwinds. As Vice President Joe Biden told Obama after the law passed: \u201cThis is a big f\u2014ing deal.\u201d But netting that deal also cost the president tremendous political capital. Follow us on Twitter @CNNPolitics\n\n            \n                Join us on Facebook/CNNPolitics During the August recess of 2009, angry conservatives stormed congressional town halls to protest the legislation. Repeal \u201cObamacare\u201d became the rallying cry for a new wave of tea party-backed Republican House freshmen. Their massive sweep during the 2010 elections sent moderate Democrats packing and flipped control of the House of Representatives to the GOP. Timeline of the health care law Within months of the law\u2019s passage, the controversial law was in the courts. Conflicting appellate rulings ultimately led to the case being sent to the U.S. Supreme Court. Twenty-six states also pressed the Supreme Court to examine the law. Energizing the tea party Since the law was modeled after a similar Massachusetts measure, as the state\u2019s former governor, Romney, will face heightened scrutiny from conservatives determined to hold him to his campaign promises to repeal the law. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s an upside for the president here,\u201d said Ilya Shapiro, a senior fellow at the Libertarian-leaning Cato Institute and an expert on the Supreme Court.  The ruling \u201cenergizes Republicans and the tea party.\u201d Rudalevige added, \u201cRomney will of course try to tie Obama back to the issue.\u201d And Romney will have support from the Republican National Committee, which launched the website \u201cPeopleVObamaCare.com\u201d after the court\u2019s decision. Romney press secretary Andrea Saul tweeted that in the hours after the ruling, the campaign raised $2.5 million online from more than 24,000 donors \u2013 touting a hashtag, #FullRepeal, set up to promote their effort to overturn the law. Reflecting after the ruling, Pelosi recalled the longtime dream of Sen. Ted Kennedy, a longtime champion of health care reform who died in 2009, a year before the legislation\u2019s passage. \u201cI knew that when he left us he would go to heaven and help pass the bill,\u201d she said from Capitol Hill. \u201cAnd now he can rest in peace. His dream for America\u2019s families has become a reality.\u201d Court ruling cements Obama\u2019s political legacy, experts say Photos: Who is John Roberts?

            "article_content": "Democrats and Republicans have spent months honing their messages A decision to overturn the law would be vindication for congressional Republicans Top Democrats publicly say they are confident in the law's legal strength After the court announces, it will take only seconds before both parties launch their messages No matter how the Supreme Court rules on the challenge to the health care law, it will only be a matter of minutes after that ruling is announced before attention shifts back across the street to the Capitol and to what happens next there. Congressional press aides will be ready. Democrats and Republicans have spent months honing their messages. House GOP leaders have held \u201clistening sessions\u201d with rank-and-file members, going through various scenarios. Republican leadership aides from the House and Senate have coordinated their messaging plans with Mitt Romney\u2019s presidential campaign. After the ruling is announced, it will take seconds before staffers for both parties begin to flood reporters\u2019 inboxes with news releases.  They, and their bosses, also will take to Twitter and Facebook to quickly move to frame the political fallout for the other side. Phase I: Both parties ready messages for court\u2019s decision Photos: Health care and the high court The messages are already pre-written to respond to the three different rulings the court could hand down \u2013 it could overturn the law entirely, strike down parts of the law including the individual mandate requiring people to purchase insurance coverage or pay a fine, or allow it to stand. A decision to overturn the law they dubbed \u201cObamacare\u201d would be vindication for congressional Republicans who unanimously opposed it in 2009. But House Speaker John Boehner made it clear he doesn\u2019t want Republicans \u2013 who won back control of the House in 2010 in large part because of backlash to the law \u2013 to look insensitive by doing victory dances if the court rules all or part of it unconstitutional. Bill quizzes people on 'Obamacare' 'Obamacare' myths and truths revealed Should health care cover pre-existing conditions? Forbes: Businesses need level field In a memo to his rank-and-file last week that was also shared widely with reporters, Boehner firmly directed GOP members: \u201cNo one knows what the Court will decide, and none of us would presume to know.  But if the Court strikes down all or part of the president\u2019s health care law, there will be no spiking of the ball.\u201d He stressed that with the economy still recovering, the GOP needs to keep its focus squarely on jobs. Some GOP aides and strategists privately acknowledge that if the law is upheld it gives them a cleaner election-year message \u2013 and gives their base a bigger incentive to turn out in November: The only way to take out Obamacare once and for all is to put a Republican in the White House and elect GOP majorities in both the House and Senate. To underline their opposition to the health care law and keep it as a central theme going into the November election, House GOP leaders have promised if all or any part of the law is upheld by the Supreme Court, they plan to hold a vote later this summer to repeal it or its remaining provisions. The GOP-led House has already passed several bills to retract pieces of the law or restrict funding for implementing it, but those efforts have been stopped by the Democrat-controlled Senate. A ruling proclaiming the health care law unconstitutional, or even a move to split the measure apart, would be a devastating blow not only for President Barack Obama but for congressional Democrats. They spent more than a year bridging internal divisions to pass it without any GOP support and point to it as a major accomplishment. Health-care law timeline But many House Democrats concede that backlash to the law and the messy fight to get it through Congress cost them their majority in the 2010 midterm election because it took away from a greater focus on the economy. Still they emphasize that their party made health care more affordable and accessible for middle-class Americans.  A ruling against the law could fire up their liberal base to turn out at the polls to push back at the Supreme Court, and some of the conservative justices they believe have a political bent. Top Democrats publicly say they are confident in the law\u2019s legal strength and believe it will be upheld. Bachmann: 'Mandate' essentially a tax Bachmann: Obama not talking health care CNN Explains: Health care reform House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi has predicted repeatedly the Supreme Court will uphold the health care law, and has even offered her view the justices will rule 6-3, saying law is \u201cironclad constitutionally.\u201d But the No. 2 House Democrat, Steny Hoyer of Maryland, admits there have been talks about contingency plans and the message Democrats will put out right after the decision is announced.  He signaled that Democrats will move swiftly to put the onus on Republicans if all or parts of the law are thrown out, to explain how they will ensure that the popular provisions that are in place now won\u2019t disappear. \u201cWhatever the Supreme Court does, I think the Republicans are going to have to get real about alternatives as opposed to simply saying this is bad,\u201d Hoyer told reporters last week.  He added, \u201cThe American public knows that we have to address the costs and access issues to health care.  They know it\u2019s critical to them and their families and they like a lot of what we\u2019ve done.\u201d Phase II: That\u2019s when it gets tricky If, as many on Capitol Hill believe is likely, the Supreme Court decides to rule the mandate unconstitutional but allow other provisions to continue, the GOP\u2019s next move becomes trickier. What legislation would Republicans propose and would they push for votes before the November election? \u201cUnless the court throws out the entire law, the House will vote to repeal whatever is left of Obamacare,\u201d Boehner said last week, laying out the first GOP response. The next step is tougher for Republicans, especially in a political season. While Americans oppose the overall health care law, some provisions are popular \u2014 such as prohibiting insurance companies from denying coverage for pre-existing conditions or placing lifetime caps on benefits, allowing parents to keep children on their policies until age 26, and giving seniors help with prescription drug costs. Democrats continually point to those benefits and the polls. And Republicans, aware of the popular measures, are struggling to decide what kind of incremental measures they will propose. One of the Republicans Boehner tapped to handle the GOP response is Georgia Rep. Tom Price, a physician, who told reporters if all or part of the law is taken down the GOP will move toward a \u201crational positive transition\u201d but declined to offer any details. Price has been pushing for piecemeal measures, such as a bill to allow insurers to sell policies across state lines. But he also said he did not believe any major reforms would be considered until the next Congress.  Other Republicans believe that it\u2019s important to show voters before November that they will uphold some of the popular pieces, and say these are pieces that could pass with bipartisan support. Although they are directing their members to be ready with a response to the court\u2019s decision, GOP leaders are also cautioning there\u2019s no need to rush legislation to the floor if there\u2019s a partial win. Boehner\u2019s memo promises action \u201cin the coming weeks,\u201d but GOP leaders also want to focus on a bill to renew tax cuts in July before Congress takes its month-long recess in August. A health care \u2018Judas\u2019 recounts his conversion Several leading insurance companies announced earlier this month that they will continue to cover young people under 26 who want to stay on their parent\u2019s plans and still pay for many preventive health care screenings and that may make it less urgent for Congress to pass new laws.  But if reports emerge that people are being dropped in large numbers from insurance rolls or being forced to pay significantly more for coverage, there could be pressure on Republicans to mount a legislative response to address public concerns. Pelosi signaled that Democrats plan to remind voters that they fought for these protections and warn about what happens if they are taken away. \u201cWhat we cannot say to the American people (is) we are going to throw you at the mercy of the insurance companies who refused coverage to you, rescinded policies when you\u2019re on the gurney going into the operating room, raised your rates to a point of having to be prohibitive,\u201d she said. Since Republicans run the House, Democrats are up-front about putting the ball in their court. \u201cWhatever the ruling is, I think (Republicans) are going to have a tougher time than we are,\u201d Hoyer predicted. But GOP aides counter that Obamacare belongs to the president, so he\u2019ll bear the chief responsibility for laying out a plan if there is uncertainty after the ruling.  They\u2019ll argue a more step-by-step approach is appropriate, and say the massive government overhaul Democrats pushed made things more complicated for the private insurance market and for the public. But given the bitter partisan rhetoric surrounding health care reform, any uncertainty surrounding a court decision will likely persist until after the 2012 election is settled.

            "article_content": "Rep. Ron Barber was elected earlier this month to succeed his old boss, Gabrielle Giffords His first act in Arizona as congressman is a meet-and-greet outside a supermarket Barber and Giffords were shot at a similar event in January 2011 that ended with 6 dead Days after being sworn in to fill Gabrielle Giffords\u2019 congressional seat, Rep. Ron Barber hobnobbed with constituents at a \u201cCongress On Your Corner\u201d event \u2013 the same type of meet-and-greet at which he, Giffords and 17 others were shot, six fatally. Then in her third term, Giffords was holding her own \u201cCongress On Your Corner\u201d on January 8, 2011, outside a Safeway supermarket in Tucson when authorities say Jared Lee Loughner began opening fire. Shot in the head, Giffords resigned from Congress just over a year later to focus on her recovery. Barber himself was severely injured in the shooting, though he kept his job as a congressional aide to Giffords throughout the ordeal. He told CNN\u2019s Piers Morgan in February that he decided to run for Congress after his former boss personally asked him to. \u201cI went away from the conversation and gave it considerable thought. Finally, I was able to say to her, \u2018Congresswoman, I will do that,\u2019\u201d he said. Earlier this month, he defeated Republican Jesse Kelly by a 52% to 45% margin to win Giffords\u2019 old seat and represent Arizona\u2019s 8th Congressional District. He was sworn in Tuesday in Washington. His first official event as congressman in his home state was also held outside a Safeway in Tucson, albeit a different one than where last year\u2019s shooting took place. Giffords routinely held \u201cCongress On Your Corner\u201d gatherings to meet southern Arizona residents personally, and she held one last January shortly before leaving Congress. Despite being pushed back four hours due to what Barber said on his Facebook page were \u201ctravel problems,\u201d video showed a long line of people waiting to talk to Barber on Saturday. CNN affiliate KOLD reported several hundred constituents showed up to discuss a range of issues, and that their new representative met with them one-on-one. The attendees included several people who were in the middle of the January 2011 violence. Bill Badger, one of those who helped subdue the gunman, told KOLD, \u201cI had to come down here today to get past this stage of getting over the whole thing.\u201d Another survivor, Patricia Maisch, said she didn\u2019t think \u201canybody will ever get over\u201d the shooting. \u201cYou have to live with the hole in your heart,\u201d Maisch said. On the heels of his election win, Barber has another race looming on the horizon: His term expires in January, meaning he\u2019ll be on the ballot again in November. By then, district lines in Arizona will move slightly and should become more amenable to Democrats, though still competitive. The moderate Democrat told CNN this week that he was focused on local issues, including those affecting seniors, veterans and \u201cmiddle class concerns.\u201d",

            "article_content": "CNN analysis: Current Congress least productive of past few sessions so far Of the thousands of measures introduced, only 132 have passed both houses About one in five measures were to name post offices Despite a split Congress and partisan finger-pointing, political experts say both parties are at fault The current Congress has worked just as many days as its legislative predecessors. It just has a lot less to show for it. According to a CNN analysis of congressional records that looked at bills that became law and the number of days lawmakers worked, members of the House have spent more than 150 days and Senate just over 140 days in session so far, comparable to previous Congresses at this point in the term. But of the thousands of measures introduced, only 132 passed both. About one-fifth of those measures were to approve official names for post offices. In the previous Congress, the House worked 286 days and the Senate worked 349 days. That Congress passed 383 bills, according to Library of Congress records. Each Congress spans a two-year cycle. The logjam means important pieces of legislation \u2013 such the transportation funding bill and measures to address high student loan rates and, yes, even the budget \u2013 haven\u2019t passed. It wasn\u2019t always this way. Leaders on both sides of the aisle point to the split nature of the current Congress \u2013 with Republicans controlling the House and Democrats the Senate \u2013 as the source of partisan showdowns that have further slowed legislative progress. However, the 107th Congress, which spanned 2001 and 2002, was a period in which the Senate majority changed three times while Republicans maintained control of the House. It was also a time of political unity after the 9/11 attacks. During that Congress, lawmakers enacted the No Child Left Behind Act, created the Department of Homeland Security and authorized the use of military force against Iraq among other pieces of legislation. In all, that Congress passed 377 measures. The 111th Congress in 2009 \u201cwas exceedingly productive. It was a time of unified government,\u201d said Thomas Mann, senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and co-author of \u201cIt\u2019s Even Worse Than It Looks: How the American Constitutional System Collided With the New Politics of Extremism.\u201d \u201cIf you look at major legislation passed, it ranks with the most productive in modern history.\u201d That year, the Democrat-controlled Congress passed the health care reform law. The controversial measure\u2019s passage ushered in a new era of tea party-backed Republican freshman and gave the GOP control of the 112th House in 2010. Those freshmen vowed to repeal the health care reform act and crack down on government waste and abuse. But in helping slow what they see as a runaway freight train of federal bills, they\u2019ve also helped slow the pace of government, political experts say. Obama, Truman and the \u2018Do-Nothing\u2019 Congress Biden laments GOP obstructionism Rare bipartisanship displayed in Senate Obama touts merits of 'nagging' Sen. Snowe explains why leaving Congress Take for example, last year\u2019s government shutdown battle over trimming the national debt. Tea party freshmen, true to their word, pushed hard against any compromise, demanding debt reductions only be offset by spending cuts, not revenue increases. \u201cThe Republican majority in the House, it has been one of the least productive in modern history, not surprisingly,\u201d Mann said. There are also fewer measures being sent over to the respective chambers for votes. For example, during the politically split 107th Congress, the House sent the Senate 346 measures and the Senate sent the House 199. In this Congress, the House has so far sent the Senate 198 bills and the Senate has sent the House 58. The legislative year isn\u2019t over. They still have nearly six months left, minus any vacation days, the August recess and home-visit days. Congress has passed a number of measures extending federal funding as well as free-trade agreements with South Korea, Colombia and Panama. But barring a mathematical miracle, it is unlikely this Congress will make up the legislative shortfall, especially during an election year when the focus is on campaigning and getting re-elected. Follow us on Twitter @CNNPoliticsJoin us on Facebook/CNNPolitics Both parties are quick to assign blame for the legislative slowdown. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-California, recently called on House Speaker John Boehner to nix additional recesses, although some saw it as more of a political move. \u201cInstead of recessing yet again, the House should remain at work and pass critical legislation that will create jobs for the middle class that will actually be signed into law. Republicans must not run out the clock on the economy,\u201d Pelosi wrote Boehner in a letter. The House recessed anyway. CNN reached out to Boehner\u2019s office for comment, but the office referred questions to other representatives. Other Republicans have made similar complaints about Democrats. Could Congress go from bad to worse after election? Last month, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell said Democrats are \u201cirresponsible\u201d for failing to pass a budget. \u201cIf you\u2019re looking for a simple, three-word description of the Democrat approach to the problems we face, it\u2019s this: duck and cover,\u201d McConnell said on a day of heated budget debate. At this point, the foot-dragging and finger-pointing is all about embarrassing the other party, Mann said. \u201cIt is about generating blame for something, about trying to put the other side in a difficult political position.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Democrats won a special election to replace former Rep. Gabby Giffords Top House Democrats were quick to tout the victory in a district that leans Republican Top Republicans downplayed the loss Crowley: Dems' strategy in Arizona could be a template for fall It\u2019s been a tough couple of weeks for the Democratic Party, especially the results in last week\u2019s Wisconsin governor recall vote. So Tuesday night\u2019s victory in the special election in Arizona\u2019s 8th Congressional District couldn\u2019t have come at a better time. For Democrats, \u201cit\u2019s an oasis in the desert\u201d says CNN chief political correspondent Candy Crowley. The race was to succeed former Democratic Rep. Gabby Giffords, who stepped down in January, one year after surviving a gunshot wound to the head. Her former aide Ron Barber, who also was severely injured in the shooting, beat Republican candidate Jesse Kelly, a former Marine who narrowly lost to Giffords in the 2010 midterm elections. Because of Giffords\u2019 high profile, the race garnered national attention. Giffords votes for successor  in election Ron Barber shows support for Obama Giffords stumps for former aide in rare public appearance Jobs and the economy were the top issues in the race, with Kelly trying to tie Barber to President Obama and to make the contest a referendum on the president. Barber, a moderate Democrat, tried to stick to local issues, but did say Monday on CNN\u2019s \u201cPiers Morgan Tonight\u201d that he would vote for Obama in November. As expected, top House Democrats were quick to tout the victory in the district, which encompasses the southeastern corner of the state including parts of Tucson, a district that leans slightly Republican. \u201cArizona\u2019s 8th Congressional District has more registered Republicans than Democrats, this race has been rated a toss-up throughout the election and Republican outside groups outspent Democratic outside groups by more than $500,000,\u201d said Rep. Steve Israel of New York, chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee. \u201cRon Barber\u2019s strong campaign made this a referendum on the Republican plans to drastically cut Medicare and privatize Social Security, while giving massive tax breaks to millionaires, Big Oil and corporations that ship jobs overseas. The Republican plan lost.\u201d \u201cThis campaign previewed the message fight that will play out across the country in November: Democrats committed to protecting the middle class, Social Security and Medicare versus misleading Republican attacks on Obamacare and national Democrats,\u201d Israel said. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, the former House Speaker and top Democrat in the chamber, echoed Israel\u2019s emphasis on the middle class, Medicare and Social Security, saying that Barber \u201chas run, and won, this campaign by holding fast to the values and priorities shared by families across southern Arizona: creating jobs, strengthening the middle class and protecting the promises of Medicare and Social Security for seniors and future generations.\u201d Top Republicans played down the loss. \u201cSpecial elections are unique, and the tragic turn of events that led to this one are no exception. No one wanted this election to happen, or to see Gabrielle Giffords step down from Congress, but Jesse ran a campaign focused on pro-growth policies that will lead to less government and a strong and vibrant economy,\u201d Rep. Pete Sessions, chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee, said. \u201cIt is clear that Ron Barber knew that voters in this district would never accept his true positions on President Obama\u2019s agenda, which have made a bad economy worse in this state. That explains why he did his best to conceal his support for so much of that agenda,\u201d Sessions said. \u201cBarber will not have that advantage in November when he will be on the ballot with President Obama, nor will any of his House Democrat colleagues.\u201d So which party\u2019s right about the implications from Arizona? \u201cSpecial elections, by nature, involve special circumstances, and you\u2019re not going to see another race this fall where the former and incoming member were both victims of such a horrific attack,\u201d Jessica Taylor, senior analyst/reporter at the nonpartisan Rothenberg Political Report, said. \u201cIn the end, this tells us more about this snapshot in time predicated by the tragic events that caused this race, than the efficacy of these messages in other districts, even though both parties did hew closely to the arguments they\u2019ll make this fall. \u201cWhile they\u2019ll make gains, Democrats still face a highly unlikely road back to the majority in November, and this was a seat they held onto, not gained. They\u2019ll have to hold others, more difficult than this and knock off other Republicans to make a chink in the GOP\u2019s advantage,\u201d Taylor said. The Democrats still need a pick up of 25 GOP-held seats to win back the House in November. But a win\u2019s a win, and at a time when the party and the president are experiencing a turbulent ride, the results in Arizona are a quick shot in the arm. \u201cYou can nitpick this in a variety of ways,\u201d Crowley said, \u201cbut the fact of the matter is that the Democrats won. After last week, this is a long cold drink of water for the Democrats, and they\u2019ll take it.\u201d Can this victory translate to November? Crowley said the Democrats\u2019 emphasis on entitlements in the Arizona District 8 contest \u201ccan be a template for other Democrats facing a rough re-election in November.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Partisan bickering likely to continue after elections Health care, economy remain wedge issues Senate power shift could happen after 2012 election Think this current climate of political polarization is bad? Things could get even uglier in 2013. With a third of the Senate and every seat in the House up for election this year, each side is already bragging about how likely it is they will win back or take over the next Congress. But if the past three years are any indicator, no matter if the Republicans or Democrats control the House or Senate \u2013 or both \u2013 gridlock, brinkmanship and stalemate could continue to plague the next president and frustrate the American electorate. The ongoing back and forth Friday between the White House and Republican leadership over exactly who is at fault for the weak economy offers a glimpse into what\u2019s in store. \u201cOne of the things that people get so frustrated about is that instead of actually talking about what would help, we get wrapped up in these political games. That\u2019s what we need to put an end to,\u201d President Barack Obama said on Friday, a day when politicos on both sides of the aisle played the blame game over the country\u2019s fiscal troubles. Voters have been clear in expressing their displeasure with Congress, whose approval ratings \u2013 currently only 15% of Americans polled think Congress is doing a good job \u2013 have been in the basement for much of the past few years. And it doesn\u2019t stop there. Just look at, for instance, Congress\u2019 work habits. Obama: Economy 'is not doing fine' Romney: Obama not up to the task The Republican-controlled House\u2019s frequent election-year recesses do little to clear the mountain of legislative work off their plates and have rankled such Democratic colleagues as House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-California. \u201cInstead of recessing yet again, the House should remain at work and pass critical legislation that will create jobs for the middle class that will actually be signed into law. Republicans must not run out the clock on the economy,\u201d Pelosi wrote in a letter to House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, this week, adding that the upcoming recess is the ninth weeklong break this year. Whether President Obama or Republican Mitt Romney occupies the Oval Office next year, both men are facing an indigestion-inducing plate full of domestic problems. Either one could, for instance, have to preside over a dramatic overhaul of the health care reform law if the Supreme Court strikes down the individual coverage mandate as unconstitutional this month. The original law passed in 2010 without a single Republican vote in the House or the Senate. The backlog of bills that have passed in one chamber but are in limbo in another include the hotly debated transportation bill. Many House Republicans want any deal on the transportation construction measure to include approval of the Keystone XL oil pipeline. In the Senate, both parties are at loggerheads on the best way to address mushrooming student loan rates. If the balance of power in the Senate shifts to the Republicans, as some political analysts expect, or Democrats and Republican end up with a near equal number of seats, partisan gridlock could become even worse. Both the Cook Political Report and the Rothenberg Political Report  suggest that at least two to four Senate seats are in play, including open seats in the battleground states of Virginia and Wisconsin. Seats in Massachusetts, Nevada, New Mexico and Maine are also competitive. \u201cYou can expect these bitter times to continue,\u201d said Thomas Mann, a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution and co-author of the book \u201cIt\u2019s Even Worse Than It Looks: How the American Constitutional System Collided With the New Politics of Extremism.\u201d It\u2019s little wonder why. A new Pew Research Center study found that the nation is more politically polarized than it has been in the past 25 years and \u201cthe values gap between Republicans and Democrats is now greater than gender, age, race or class divides.\u201d So, there\u2019s little chance of compromise on solutions for shoring up the ailing economy and stanching job losses as the country braces for the impact of more than $1 trillion in mandatory budget cuts set to kick in next year. Follow us on Twitter @CNNPoliticsJoin us on Facebook/CNNPolitics Should Obama win re-election, he\u2019ll be a second-term president facing a narrow window to accomplish policy goals before he enters the lame duck phase of his office. \u201cIf president Obama is re-elected he will have to work with a Republican Senate to define his legacy,\u201d said Nathan Gonzales, deputy editor of The Rothenberg Political Report. Obama\u2019s \u201cbig opportunity will be 2013.\u201d That\u2019s the same year sequestration, massive mandatory across the board budget cuts, are triggered as part of a congressional deal that allowed Obama to raise the debt ceiling. The large defense budget, which many Republican lawmakers defend as necessary to maintain, will face substantial cuts. Ironically, Obama may have to take a harder, more partisan line in order to get his agenda passed, Mann said. \u201cIt\u2019s his second term. The country is facing serious problems,\u201d Mann said. \u201cIf the Republicans are playing an opposition game I can\u2019t imagine he can peacefully engage in constructive negotiations with (Republicans). He would find the same problem he faces today.\u201d Things aren\u2019t likely to go much easier for Romney. If Romney should win the general election and his party maintains control of the House and ekes out a Senate majority, the newly minted president may still face some political headaches. Candidates down ballot may get a boost from a Romney win, but it is unlikely his party will net the 60 seats needed for a filibuster-proof Senate majority. He\u2019ll also face intense pressure from his party to keep his campaign promises and steer clear of compromise. \u201cIf Romney is elected he\u2019ll have a brief honeymoon period,\u201d said Larry Sabato, director of the University of Virginia\u2019s Center for Politics. \u201cIn this polarized era I see no reason for optimism there.",

            "article_content": "Gov. Scott Walker beats challenger Tom Barrett by a 53%-46% margin Walker's margin of victory larger than 2010 race in which he also faced Barrett Democrats spurred the recall effort over Walker's efforts to weaken public unions Tens of millions of dollars have poured in from outside the state, mostly for Walker In a vote that could have implications on both the November presidential race and for organized labor, Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker on Tuesday successfully overcame a recall vote that would have removed him from office. With almost all of the votes in, Walker, a Republican hero for pushing austerity measures that stripped collective bargaining rights from most public unions, led Milwaukee Mayor Tom Barrett by a 53-46 margin. Tuesday\u2019s vote was the culmination of a 15-month near-civil war that pitted unions and Democratic supporters against fiscal conservatives and Republicans after Walker signed a bill in March 2011 passed by the Republican-controlled legislature that took collective bargaining rights away from public employee unions in a effort to close the state\u2019s budget gap. Analysis: Wisconsin now tougher climb for Obama, but still uphill climb for Romney Tens of thousands of demonstrators opposing Walker crowded the grounds around the state capitol and hung banners of protest in its rotunda after Walker signed the bill and kicked off a recall drive that gathered 900,000 signatures \u2013 nearly 400,000 more than required. Union members upset over Walker victory What's next for Gov. Walker? Walker: 'Time to move Wisconsin forward' Politician slapped in the face During a bitter fight over the law last year, Democratic legislators left the capital to prevent a quorum. In declaring victory on Tuesday, Walker said the outcome validated his hard line on cost-cutting. \u201cTonight, we tell Wisconsin, we tell our country and we tell people all across the globe that voters really do want leaders who stand up and make the tough decisions,\u201d he told a roaring crowd at his campaign headquarters in Waukesha. He also addressed the polarized climate in the normally centrist state \u2013 his crowd jeered when he mentioned that he had a phone conversation with Barrett before taking the stage. Walker\u2019s win bolsters tea party, weakens Democrats \u201cBringing our state together will take some time \u2013 there\u2019s just no doubt about it,\u201d he said. But he offered a first step by inviting members of the legislature over for bratwursts and burgers, \u201cand then maybe a little bit of good Wisconsin beer, as well.\u201d In conceding, Barrett also drew catcalls when he mentioned the call with Walker. And he said it was important that he and the governor work together. But he urged his supporters to fight on\u2019 \u201cThis is not an end,\u201d he said. \u201cTonight ends another chapter in Wisconsin history but there\u2019s more to come.\u201d Unions pointed to Walker supporters\u2019 outspending his opponents by a more than 7-1 margin, 70% of it from outside the state. \u201cAdding to this gargantuan challenge of recalling only the third governor in American history was the flood of secret corporate cash distorting our democracy \u2013 a dangerous example of a post-Citizens United America,\u201d AFL-CIO president Richard Trumka said in a statement after the vote, referring to the Supreme Court decision that allowed unlimited political contributions from corporations and unions. Both parties cast the debate as a larger referendum on the role of government and policies supported by both parties. While political pundits framed the race as a test run for the presidential election, fiscal conservatives were looking for momentum in a growing movement to curb what they see as public employee unions getting larded with benefits from politicians that they helped elect. \u201c(Walker\u2019s) one of the Republican governors who has been out on the point on this issue about whether there are excesses in public employee unions in terms of their pension plans or health care plans and so forth,\u201d CNN political analyst David Gergen said. \u201cThis is a very, very hot issue from New York to California and from New Jersey to Indiana to Ohio to Wisconsin. \u201cAnd this election tonight was well-regarded long before by both sides as the second most important election of the year. And here Scott Walker, I must say, to a surprise, given a year ago, it looked like he was going to lose this, tonight, to win is a substantial defeat for labor, for public employee unions, and a substantial defeat \u2013 a substantial victory for those who have been trying to curb them.\u201d Gergen: A victory for curbs on public worker unions Public opinion polls leading up to the vote had shown Walker holding a narrowing lead and early exit polls suggested the race would be tight, with 34% of those responding identifying themselves as Democrats, 35% saying they\u2019re Republicans and 31% saying they\u2019re independents. A state official said on condition of not being identified that turnout appeared to be strong, with reports of some polling places running out of forms for same-day voter registration. The race was a rematch of the 2010 governor\u2019s contest, won by Walker with only 52% of the vote. Recalling a governor is rare \u2013 trying to, not so much Obama skipping Wisconsin recall vote? Kapanke: Wis. recall a 'landmark day' Wisconsin recall: Dry run for November Wisconsin's 'Total Recall' gets ugly But this time, the stakes were higher. The first-term governor\u2019s win could give Republicans a major boost in efforts to make Wisconsin a battleground state in the November presidential election. It now has a strong ground operation in a state that has been remained blue since 1988. But exit polls indicate that the vote Tuesday wasn\u2019t the presidential litmus test that many pundits suggested. While Barrett went down to defeat, those responding to exit polls favored President Barack Obama over GOP presumptive presidential nominee Mitt Romney by a 51-44 margin. And Obama got higher marks than Romney on handling the economy by a slim margin and on helping the middle class by a wider margin. Romney reacts to Walker\u2019s win Obama easily won the state in 2008, but Walker\u2019s unyielding commitment to fiscal austerity in the face of chaotic protests last year made him the poster child for tea party conservatism. Walker would have been only the third governor in U.S. history ousted by a recall election. Along with the gubernatorial recall, Lt. Gov. Rebecca Kleefisch also won her recall election. Four Republican senators also faced recall votes Tuesday but results were not yet available. A loss of any of those four races would have tipped control of the Senate to Democrats, but with the legislature out of session until after the general election, a Democratic win would have provided mostly a moral victory. A former Republican state senator ousted in a Wisconsin recall vote last year said Tuesday that the political wound he suffered was worth it because of the fiscal austerity achieved. \u201cI lost my job standing for something, and I was standing for the people, fiscal responsibility and the future of this country and the state and its residents,\u201d Dan Kapanke said, adding that \u201cthe times dictate tough decisions, and we want our elected officials to do the right thing and worry about the future and not just about the next election.\u201d Walker complains that repeated recall efforts over past years are stalling progress and costing the state needed money. Earlier Tuesday, Barrett said he agrees that voters are tired of recall politics, but he blamed Walker for creating a divisive political environment that inspired the effort to oust him. \u201cWhat Gov. Walker doesn\u2019t say is he was the one who, these are his words, dropped the bomb and attempted to divide and conquer. So he set out on a strategy to divide this state. He succeeded in dividing the state,\u201d Barrett said, adding that the proper course now is to \u201cget rid of the instigator rather than to allow him to continue because I think this state will remain this bitterly divided if he continues in office.\u201d About $64 million has been spent on the race since November, an analysis from the Center for Public Integrity found. That\u2019s a state record, shattering the record of $37.4 million spent during the 2010 governor\u2019s race. Wisconsin\u2019s deep political anger isn\u2019t going away Walker collected $30.5 million to Barrett\u2019s $4 million. Roughly two-thirds of Walker\u2019s contributions came from out of state, the Center for Public Integrity reported, while only a quarter of Barrett\u2019s funds originated from outside Wisconsin. Barrett said Tuesday that such outside influence is a change for Wisconsin. \u201cWhat\u2019s happened is, Scott Walker has become the rock star of the far right and has been able to raise literally millions of dollars from out-of-state contributors,\u201d Barrett said. Dollars roll in from beyond Wisconsin for recall During a bitter fight over the law last year, Democratic legislators left the capital to prevent a quorum, and tens of thousands of protesters converged on the State Capitol building in what became an occupation. After the law was signed, Democrats immediately began a recall effort that led to Tuesday\u2019s vote. Walker has defended his budget actions as necessary for the fiscal health of his state and described his campaign as one of a strong leader who is making the necessary \u201ctough decisions.\u201d The campaign has been fierce, with campaigners complaining of keyed cars, verbal harassment and a general lack of tolerance for differing opinions. \u201cWe have an example of Hatfields and McCoys going on in this state like we have never seen,\u201d said Brian Nemoir, a Milwaukee-based Republican strategist. \u201cPeople are hyper-engaged, as much in support for their own candidate as in disgust for the opponent.\u201d Handmade signs were nearly as prevalent as official ones. Some locals say they have resorted to lowering their voices in public when discussing the recall to avoid setting off arguments with strangers. The Justice Department on Monday dispatched federal observers to monitor Milwaukee polling places Tuesday to ensure that no voter discrimination took place. A litany of Republican stars have campaigned for Walker, including fellow governors Chris Christie of New Jersey, Nikki Haley of South Carolina, Bobby Jindal of Louisiana and Bob McDonnell of Virginia, as well as U.S. Sen. Marco Rubio from Florida. While Romney didn\u2019t campaign for Walker in Wisconsin, he quickly congratulated the governor after his victory. \u201cGovernor Walker has demonstrated over the past year what sound fiscal policies can do to turn an economy around, and I believe that in November voters across the country will demonstrate that they want the same in Washington, D.C.,\u201d Romney said in a statement. Americans for Prosperity, a conservative advocacy group built around many of the same principles as the tea party, has pumped more than $10 million into Wisconsin backing Walker\u2019s policies. Barrett, meanwhile, got his own high-powered support from former President Clinton, as well as Democratic National Committee Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz and Maryland Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley. However, his campaign fund-raising has badly trailed the support Walker received. The Progressive Change Campaign Committee announced Saturday that it was spending $100,000 in the five days before the Wisconsin recall vote, bringing its investment to $300,000. Obama never came to Wisconsin to campaign for Barrett, which Republicans surmised was because the president believes Barrett will lose. On Sunday, Barrett said on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union\u201d that his campaign never asked Obama to appear on his behalf, adding that \u201cwe understand he\u2019s got a lot going on.\u201d White House Press Secretary Jay Carney acknowledged the uniqueness of the contest while stressing there\u2019s no doubt where the president stood. \u201cThe president\u2019s made clear all along his opposition to those who would take away workers rights \u2013 to actions that would take away or diminish worker\u2019s rights,\u201d Carney said. \u201cAnd he\u2019s also made clear his support for Tom Barrett.\u201d Four Republican senators also faced recall votes Tuesday but results were not yet available. A loss of any of those four races would have tipped control of the Senate to Democrats, but with the legislature out of session until after the general election, a Democratic win would have provided mostly a moral victory.

            "article_content": "House Republicans want to roll back regulation, dismantle \"Obamacare\" None of these measures will likely become law, but are election-year manuevering Congress must act by the end of the year to avoid dire fiscal consequences If House Republicans have their way this summer, the Bush-era tax cuts would become permanent, \u201cObamacare\u201d would begin to be dismantled and energy regulations would be rolled back. On Friday, House GOP leaders unveiled their summer agenda with an eye on the fall campaign, including those and other items that probably won\u2019t become law, but will highlight the party\u2019s message on the economy. In a memo to GOP members, Majority Leader Eric Cantor promised a vote on the most contentious issue \u2013extending the Bush-era tax cuts that expire at the end of the year \u2014 before the House begins its monthlong summer break in August. Republican leaders have been mum on the details, but the measure is expected to renew the current rates for some period and lay out a framework for tax reform that lowers rates across the board. Many of the details, however, including which deductions would be eliminated, would be put off until next year. Cantor\u2019s memo says the House will focus in the coming months on \u201caddressing job creation and the economy, reducing spending and shrinking the size of the federal government while protecting and expanding liberty.\u201d In addition to the tax issue, the majority of items Cantor cites for floor action \u2013 votes to repeal portions of Obamacare, roll back \u201cjob-inhibiting\u201d red tape and press for more domestic energy production \u2013 will land with a thud in the Democrat-led Senate. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid has made it clear that anything the GOP-led House passes dealing with taxes or deficit cuts is DOA in the Senate. With the November election five months away and almost zero motivation for bipartisan cooperation, the reality is that any major action will be postponed until after the election. The fiscal cliff Another thorny issue facing Congress: how to deal with automatic spending cuts to federal agencies scheduled to go into effect in January as part of the budget deal last summer. Republicans in the House and Senate are pushing bills to fence off any impact on defense with deeper cuts to domestic programs. In a recent letter to GOP senators, Reid said the Republican line in the sand against new revenues means no deal on these issues can happen.\u201dUnfortunately, it appears that Republicans\u2019 blind adherence to tea party extremism is making it impossible to reach this sort of balanced agreement before the election,\u201d Reid wrote. Cantor\u2019s memo leaves out how the House will deal with some lingering and politically charged issues before the election. Both Democrats and Republicans say they want to avoid interest rates on student loans doubling in July, but there is no agreement yet on how to pay for legislation to head off the increase. The House passed a bill targeting what the GOP says is a \u201cslush fund\u201d that pays for public health programs as part of the health care law. Democrats want to offset the costs with a tax on some businesses. After the Senate failed to pass either party\u2019s preferred plan, the standoff continues. Transportation, women, drugs, post office on agenda While both chambers passed legislation \u2013 the \u201cViolence Against Women Act\u201d \u2013 that funds programs combating domestic abuse, the issue has become a political battle, with Democrats arguing GOP resistance to expanding protections to gays and lesbians and native Americans amounts to a \u201cwar on women.\u201d Republicans counter that Democrats hijacked the measure for political purposes and are picking a \u201cfake fight\u201d to appeal to female voters. House and Senate leaders are also still negotiating details on a multiyear transportation bill that gives states billions of dollars for new infrastructure projects. But both sides are tangling over how long to authorize the federal program and the GOP\u2019s insistence that the bill include authorization for the Keystone pipeline that would transport oil from Canada down to the Gulf of Mexico. There are some areas where bipartisan action is expected. After the Memorial Day holiday the House will take up a bipartisan intelligence bill, and legislation reforming how the Food and Drug Administration approves new drugs, a measure that passed overwhelmingly in the Senate.The House will vote on Oversight Committee Chariman Darrell Issa\u2019s proposal to overhaul the postal service, which will need to be reconciled with a different package the Senate passed this month. Dialing up the rhetoric The Republican agenda signals the rhetoric on the House floor in June and July will match the sticky Washington heat. The GOP is planning votes on energy bills most Democrats oppose, pushing for more drilling on public lands and removing federal regulations on energy producers. Nadeam Elshami, spokesman for House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi, immediately dismissed the GOP calendar. \u201cThe Republicans have spelled out an agenda that fails to address jobs and will hold the middle class tax cuts hostage because the GOP refuses to let millionaires, Big Oil and corporations that ship jobs overseas pay their fair share,\u201d Elshami said. While both parties eagerly await the ruling from the U.S. Supreme Court on whether the president\u2019s signature health care law will stand, the House will vote to repeal a tax on medical devices that helps fund the law and overturn a provision of the law that would prohibit the use of personal spending accounts to pay for over the counter medications. GOP congressional leaders have been huddling on how to address health care if the high court strikes down the law, but aides caution that nothing has been decided on what kind of reforms Republicans would pursue if they were given a clean slate. Continuing their pledge to slash federal spending, the House will also vote on bills reducing federal agencies\u2019 budgets, but few of these bills are expected to pass the Senate, so both sides are gearing up for negotiations on a short-term bill to keep the government funded after the current authority runs out in September. While there may be a flurry of activity this summer on Capitol Hill, it\u2019s safe to say the December \u201clame duck\u201d session of Congress will be a jam-packed month where most of these issues will be resolved.",

            "article_content": "Possible VP choices have been out attacking Obama Rubio, Ayotte, Christie, Jindal and others have been mentioned as running mates for Romney Biden has been playing similar role for Obama Wanted: A political attack dog ready to tear into President Barack Obama. Must play by team rules, be able to withstand the pressure of a presidential campaign and pass a rigorous vetting process. Being qualified to be president is a definite plus. If Mitt Romney posted a job ad for a vice presidential running mate, it might sound like this. Yet despite Romney\u2019s real VP job search being secret, several potential applicants appear to be openly vying for the job, keeping their names in the audition pool by showing how sharp their teeth really are. Florida Sen. Marco Rubio has called the president the most \u201cdivisive\u201d in modern history. Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal has said Obama is the most \u201cincompetent.\u201d Frequent anti-Obama flame-thrower Gov. Chris Christie of New Jersey has said he can be convinced to run. Ohio Sen. Rob Portman accused the president of lacking \u201cpresidential leadership.\u201d And New Hampshire Sen. Kelly Ayotte wants to debate Vice President Joe Biden. And they are not alone. House Budget Chairman Paul Ryan and former Minnesota Gov. Tim Pawlenty are also among the potential Romney running mates who\u2019ve gone on the attack. Publicly, all of them have denied or thrown cold water on the idea of being Romney\u2019s No. 2. But don\u2019t believe that for a second. Many think that tactic is just part of the dance. \u201cLook, it boils down to this: For the vast majority of the so-called \u2018non-candidates,\u2019 it would take them a nanosecond to say, \u2018Yes,\u2019\u201d said University of Virginia professor Larry Sabato, also director of the school\u2019s Center for Politics. \u201cThey\u2019re not kidding anybody,\u201d Sabato said. \u201cA run for vice president is a gamble worth taking. The payoff is potentially enormous even if you lose.\u201d Follow us on Twitter @CNNPoliticsJoin us on Facebook/CNNPolitics Amid the auditions, consider the qualifications: The person must be ready to be president, not overshadow Romney, help him in a region or with a group where he may struggle, not depress the conservative base and stay ready to attack, attack, attack. Biden checks many of those boxes, helping with middle- and lower-class whites who are sour on the president. Biden also fires up the Democratic base and revels in his role as political pit bull, like he did last weekend in Ohio, drumming up support among white, middle-class workers in an area where Obama hadn\u2019t done well. \u201cThe president likes to be kind of above the fray and doesn\u2019t really believe in anger and rage; he\u2019s very cool and unflappable,\u201d said Douglas Brinkley, presidential historian and political analyst. \u201cBut that can sometimes translate as aloof. Joe Biden provides the kind of feisty, muscular counterpart.\u201d Romney\u2019s potential running mates know if they want to rumble, they must prove they are ready for the fight. Sen. Marco RubioEnter Rubio. The Florida freshman senator is, arguably, the loudest Obama critic on the list. Though he\u2019s frequently said he\u2019s not interested in the No. 2 spot, his activities of late suggest he\u2019s at least trying out for the job. For example, Romney has called the president \u201cdivisive.\u201d On Saturday at a South Carolina GOP fundraiser, Rubio took that line a step further: accusing the president of being the most divisive in modern history. But Rubio didn\u2019t stop there. He recently defended Romney over the U.S. handling of a Chinese dissident and showed his own foreign policy prowess. Rubio could help the presumptive nominee in the battleground state of Florida, with its critical 29 electoral votes. He could help Romney close the large Hispanic gap against the president and could shore up tea party support, since many core activists don\u2019t think Romney is a true conservative. The downside of Rubio\u2019s resume is his lack of national experience. \u201cHe\u2019s been in the Senate as long as (Sarah) Palin was governor,\u201d Sabato said, referring to concerns that Rubio may not be ready to be president. \u201cAnd he\u2019s never been vetted in a national race. Running in a single state is nothing compared to a national race.\u201d Gov. Bobby Jindal Louisiana\u2019s Jindal also appears to be auditioning. Newspapers in Alabama report that Jindal recently called Obama \u201cthe most incompetent president since Jimmy Carter.\u201d The Louisiana governor has held to the Romney campaign line as recently as Wednesday on MSNBC, touting the candidate\u2019s education proposals on the same day that Romney gave an education speech. In that appearance, Jindal was asked about potentially being Romney\u2019s running mate. He refused to speculate, instead going on the attack against the president. But when pressed about not explicitly denying he\u2019s interested, Jindal just smiled. Jindal, an Indian-American conservative, could help Romney with certain ethnic minorities. He is deemed qualified, and he could help the northeastern Romney with conservatives in the South. And yet, Sabato said, \u201cAs Jindal proved when he gave the response to the [2009] State of the Union \u2013 he\u2019s not a scintillating public speaker.\u201d But the governor of New Jersey is. Gov. Chris Christie Christie recently said Romney \u201cmight be able to convince\u201d him to join the ticket. Christie \u2013 a rock star in Republican circles \u2013 has frequently echoed Romney\u2019s campaign attacks, helped other GOP candidates and fired up the conservative base. But Christie\u2019s apparent audition may fall flat. The governor has moderate positions on some issues, which could reinforce the notion among some that Romney is too moderate himself. Also, Christie may not be able to turn traditionally blue New Jersey red. Another potential pitfall: \u201c[Christie\u2019s] propensity for saying controversial things, which would land him on the front pages every two or three days, overshadowing the presidential nominee,\u201d Sabato said. Sen. Rob Portman Rob Portman would likely not have that problem. The Ohio freshman senator is blander and breathes less fire than some of the others. But that does not mean he can\u2019t try. Last week at a fiscal summit, Portman accused the president of lacking \u201cpresidential leadership\u201d during last year\u2019s deficit talks. Portman could help Romney win Ohio\u2019s 18 electoral votes \u2013 no Republican has ever won the White House without Ohio. He is also widely deemed as qualified. Yet, his service as President George W. Bush\u2019s budget director and trade representative could prove problematic, giving Democrats yet another Bush-staffers-as-bogeymen storyline they deployed in 2008. Meanwhile, what better way to audition as a running mate than to suggest debating the current vice president? Sen. Kelly Ayotte Not only has Kelly Ayotte said she is more qualified to be president than Obama was in 2008, but the senator went even further by raising the idea of debating Biden. Ayotte could help Romney in New Hampshire, an important swing state that neighbors Romney\u2019s political home of Massachusetts. But the Granite State went for Obama in 2008. Also, Ayotte would almost certainly help Romney close the gender gap against the president. But there\u2019s also a question of experience and readiness. \u201cEven though she was state attorney general before she became senator, she\u2019s got the Palin problem of having been in major office only a year and a half,\u201d Sabato said. \u201cI think she\u2019s well down on the list.\u201d Rep. Paul Ryan House Budget Chairman Ryan and former Romney primary rival Pawlenty have also showed they\u2019d be good No. 2 picks. Ryan has frequently pushed the Republicans\u2019 \u201cclass warfare\u201d line against the president and has unveiled a budget that\u2019s a battle cry for many conservatives. Also, Ryan hails from Wisconsin, an important battleground, and his youthfulness could appeal to a group that the president enjoys advantages with. Yet Democrats savor the opportunity to have Ryan\u2019s budget proposals \u2013 which they liken to a war on the poor \u2013 at the center of the presidential campaign. Former Gov. Tim Pawlenty As for Pawlenty, he\u2019s willingly spoken on behalf of the Romney campaign, relishing the attack dog role. In Romney\u2019s second general election ad, Pawlenty appears in the first four seconds, suggesting that his audition is going well. Pawlenty has problems. The former Minnesota governor failed to make a dent in the GOP primaries and likely would have a problem helping Romney win Minnesota. It\u2019s entirely possible that someone not currently auditioning to be Romney\u2019s running mate could win the VP process. Former Gov. Sarah Palin Then there\u2019s Sarah Palin. In 2008, then-Alaska Gov. Palin was not high on the list of potentials and not widely seen as trying out for the job. And yet, after being picked, Palin did assume the traditional running mate\u2019s attack dog role. And in yet another twist in the process, others had the VP job and did not assume the traditional attack role. \u201cCertain vice presidents just don\u2019t [fit that bill],\u201d Brinkley said. \u201cYou wouldn\u2019t expect George Herbert Walker Bush to do that for Ronald Reagan. It just wasn\u2019t in his personality. Or Al Gore to Bill Clinton. He just couldn\u2019t pull it off in a way.\u201d",

            "article_content": "NEW: Romney: \"The issue is who is going to do what it takes to put out the fire\" Romney targets Obama over the $787 billion stimulus package he signed in 2009 Republicans believe they can win Iowa, which voted for Obama in 2008 An Obama ad hits Romney over his corporate business background Mitt Romney continued his blitz against President Barack Obama over the federal deficit on Tuesday, signaling a GOP shift away from social issues and back to what Republicans consider the president\u2019s Achilles\u2019 heel: the economy. The presumptive GOP presidential nominee gave a speech on government spending in the battleground state of Iowa, the same day as House Speaker John Boehner cautioned of another battle brewing in Congress over the national debt ceiling. Romney targeted the president over the $787 billion stimulus package Obama signed soon after taking office in 2009, a move Romney described as the \u201cmost careless one-time expenditure by the federal government in history.\u201d \u201cWe still owe the money, we\u2019re still paying interest on it, and it\u2019ll be that way long after this presidency ends in January,\u201d he said. Romney\u2019s trip marks his first time back to Iowa since the Republican caucuses in early January, when he finished a close second to rival Rick Santorum. In terms of the economy, the state fares better than others. Its unemployment level sits at 5.2% compared to the national average of 8.2%. While Obama carried Iowa in 2008 with 54% of the vote, the state is widely expected to be in play this fall after Republicans picked up the governor\u2019s seat and the state house in the 2010 elections. Ron Paul supporters have a plan Romney, however, emphasized the more than $5 trillion increase in the debt since Obama took office in 2009, and took a shot at Republicans for contributing to the problem, as well. Boehner poised for another debt showdown Pawlenty:Romney respects private economy Carney: Well-run bank can make bad calls Looking at Romney's health care record. \u201cA prairie fire of debt is sweeping across Iowa and our nation and every day we fail to act we feed that fire with our own lack of resolve,\u201d he said in his speech, delivered at a hotel in Des Moines. \u201cThis is not solely a Democratic or Republican problem. This issue here isn\u2019t who deserves the most blame. The issue is who is going to do what it takes to put out the fire.\u201d After the speech, Team Obama quickly fired off on their likely opponent\u2019s remarks. In a statement, the campaign insisted Romney has no specific plan of his own to combat the deficit. \u201cMitt Romney simply wants to return to the same policies that caused the crisis and weakened the middle class: budget-busting tax cuts for the wealthiest Americans and letting Wall Street write its own rules. Loading the country up with debt while giving tax breaks to the wealthy \u2013 America can\u2019t afford Romney Economics,\u201d said campaign spokeswoman Lis Smith. JP Morgan makes Wall Street regulation a campaign issue Ahead of his speech, Romney\u2019s campaign released a new web video called \u201c23 million.\u201d The nearly four-minute spot features three unemployed Iowans discussing their struggles as they look for work. The Bureau of Labor Statistics estimated in its April jobs report that 12.5 million Americans were unemployed. When factoring in those who were underemployed or who had dropped out of the workforce, the number increased to 23 million. On the other side, a super PAC supporting Obama\u2019s re-election released a dueling television ad Tuesday morning, hitting Romney over his corporate business background as the founder of a private equity firm. The ad shows laid-off workers from one of the companies that went bankrupt eight years after it was purchased by Bain Capital. \u201cHe promised us the same things he\u2019s promising the United States,\u201d one of the former workers says in the ad. \u201cHe\u2019ll give you the same thing he gave us: nothing. He\u2019ll take it all.\u201d Meanwhile, Boehner called to mind last year\u2019s near-shutdowns of the government Tuesday when he promised to hold firm on large spending cuts before approving a hike in the debt ceiling at the end of the year. \u201cWhen the time comes, I will again insist on my simple principle of cuts and reforms greater than the debt limit increase.  This is the only avenue I see right now to force the elected leadership of this country to solve our structural fiscal imbalance,\u201d Boehner said at the Peter G. Peterson Foundation\u2019s 2012 Fiscal Summit. He also singled out the president, accusing Obama of prioritizing political gain above policy. \u201cIf the president continues to put politics before principle \u2013 or party before country, as he often accuses others of doing \u2013 our economy is going to suffer and we\u2019ll miss our last chance to solve this crisis on our own terms,\u201d he said. Last year, Boehner released a similar caution, just months before Congress and the White House engaged in a bitter showdown over a deficit-reduction agreement. Racing against the clock to avoid a government default, the two parties ultimately reached a deal to extend the debt ceiling in exchange for $2.1 trillion in spending cuts. Soon after the battle, however, Standard & Poor\u2019s issued its first-ever downgrade of the U.S. credit rating, pointing to Washington partisanship as its reason. Boehner\u2019s words Tuesday foreshadow what could be a highly charged political clash at the end of the year, as lawmakers face a host of decisions involving the debt ceiling, tax extensions and spending cuts, all with a deadline set for January 1. And he\u2019s not the only one expecting the debt to re-emerge as a big issue this year. Former President Bill Clinton said at the same fiscal summit Tuesday that \u201cthis budget issue should become front and center in this election.\u201d He warned that if leaders don\u2019t reach a budget deal before the economy starts growing, Americans will regret it. \u201cIf we don\u2019t deal with it, we will sooner or later \u2026 have growth come back here and interest rates will go up so fast you won\u2019t be able to catch your breath. And then everybody will say, \u2018Why didn\u2019t we do this earlier?\u2019\u201d Boehner\u2019s comments on the debt quickly sparked an strong response from top Democrats. Rep. Steny Hoyer, the House minority whip and the chamber\u2019s No. 2 Democrat, said Boehner offered a \u201csimplistic characterization\u201d of the issue at hand. \u201cWe are buying more than we\u2019re paying for,\u201d Hoyer said to reporters on Capitol Hill. \u201cThe Republicans are good at buying and lousy at paying. They borrowed a lot of money. As a result we owe a lot of money. The debt limit is about paying back that which we have already incurred.\u201d Meanwhile, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi issued a statement accusing Boehner of making \u201cpartisan demands\u201d and charging the GOP with \u201conce again choosing millionaires over the middle class.\u201d \u201cSpeaker Boehner is threatening to take our nation into another manufactured crisis that will harm America\u2019s families,\u201d she said. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid also weighed in on Boehner\u2019s remarks, arguing that along with spending cuts, tax increases will be needed to help balance the deficit. \u201cThere is simply no way to address the challenges facing us in a way that will support our economic recovery without using both sides of the ledger.  So, of course, that means some revenues,\u201d Reid said to reporters. \u201cThe American people agree with this.\u201d CNN\u2019s Kate Bolduan, Jeanne Sahadi, Kevin Liptak and Gregory Wallace contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Obama's campaign has raised about $7.8 million from the financial sector Certain conservative groups cry \"hypocrite\" over Obama's Manhattan money hauls Romney's campaign has raised $18 million from the sector this cycle Romney uses his business background as a major point of contrast with Obama Even as his campaign portrays him as a champion of the middle class and a crusader to keep Wall Street from melting down as it did three years ago, President Barack Obama was set to leave New York Monday with a sizable haul of cash from industries whose excesses he decries from the stump. After other stops in Manhattan, the president was to attend a private dinner hosted by Tony James of the Blackstone Group, an alternative asset management and financial services company. Tickets for the event cost $35,800. The trip marked one of many fund-raising events the president has held in New York this year and adds to the already hefty war chest Obama has built from Wall Street contributions. Obama\u2019s campaign has raised about $7.8 million from the financial sector, which includes real estate, insurance, and securities and investment industries, according to the Center for Responsive Politics. Nonetheless, Obama is far behind his Republican rival, Mitt Romney, who has raised $18 million from the sector this cycle, according to Federal Election Commission reports. In his 2008 campaign, Obama took in more money from the financial sector than any other candidate in history, campaign finance reports show. At the time, he raised $15.8 million alone from securities and investment firms, besting Republican presidential nominee John McCain\u2019s $9.2 million from the same industry. Add real estate and insurance firms into the mix and that number jumped to $42 million overall for Obama and $31 million for McCain. The pattern is not lost on certain conservative groups who cry \u201chypocrite\u201d over Obama\u2019s Manhattan money hauls. Ahead of his visit Monday, conservative group American Future Fund went after Obama in a new television ad, attacking him for taking substantial contributions from financial-sector employees despite pushing for Wall Street reform over the years. \u201cI did not run for office to be helping out a bunch of fat-cat bankers on Wall Street,\u201d Obama said in 2009 television interview, which was used as a clip in the commercial. The ad then points out that Obama voted as senator for the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, also known as the Wall Street bailout. Also mentioned in the spot are members in Obama\u2019s administration and inner circle who have links to big banks, including former Democratic New Jersey Gov. Jon Corzine, whose firm MF Global declared bankruptcy in October, losing millions for investors. Team Obama announced in December that it was returning all donations from Corzine, who was a major bundler for the campaign. To further shape his image as a soldier against Wall Street excess, the president and other top Democrats frequently tout the formation of the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and the passage of the 2010 financial reform bill, both of which occurred under Obama\u2019s presidency. The American Future Fund ad comes days after JP Morgan Chase announced a staggering $2 billion loss following some complicated hedge fund trading, raising concerns of setbacks for the financial industry as it tries to recover from the 2008 meltdown. Political observers say financial regulation could soon emerge as a key campaign topic, as Democrats will likely highlight a need for stricter enforcement, while Republicans may use the incident as an example of failed policies in the Obama administration. Romney, has previously called for the repeal of the Democratic-led financial reform bill, also known as Dodd-Frank, although he has conceded some points have merit. Instead he proposes what he refers to as \u201ccommon-sense regulation.\u201d \u201cAs President, Gov. Romney will push for common-sense regulation that gives regulators tools to do their jobs, and that gives investors more clarity,\u201d his spokeswoman, Andrea Saul, said in a statement responding to the JP Morgan Chase incident on Friday. Meanwhile, Obama\u2019s campaign said Friday a takedown of Dodd-Frank would be \u201creckless.\u201d \u201cRolling back Wall Street reform, as Mitt Romney proposes, would be reckless. The law promotes transparency, limits the types of risky investments that can be made with deposits insured by federal taxpayers and prevents investment losses at one bank from threatening the whole financial system,\u201d campaign spokeswoman Lis Smith said in a statement. The fact that Romney is outpacing Obama in financial sector contributions comes as little surprise, given the former Massachusetts governor\u2019s history as a Wall Street capitalist. He founded and headed the private equity firm Bain Capital \u2013 a venture that launched Romney into a lucrative career and helped build his multimillion-dollar portfolio. Romney uses his business background as a major point of contrast with Obama, saying his time in the private sector gives him a substantive edge over the president in terms of economic issues. \u201cWhat the president has done \u2013 and I think unknowingly, never having spent any time in the private sector himself \u2013 is \u2026 one item after another, make it harder and harder for small business to thrive and to grow and start up,\u201d Romney said at a small business event in Virginia earlier this month.

            "article_content": "Romney's team must keep pace with organization that's effectively run since 2007 \"Team Obama has come out of the gates aggressively,\" veteran strategist says Romney campaign has been laser-focused on jobs With Mitt Romney\u2019s victories in the April 24 Republican primaries, a new phase of the campaign began at Obama re-election headquarters in Chicago. After a year spent hiring staff and building an organization, Obama for America finally had what it had been waiting for: an opponent. \u201cThe monologue is over,\u201d Obama campaign manager Jim Messina said the day after Romney\u2019s conclusive five-state primary sweep. \u201cNow Romney has to put his record and his agenda up against the president\u2019s, and we look forward to that debate. The general election might just be starting, but we\u2019ve been at this for more than a year in Chicago.\u201d This year of preparation certainly gave the Obama campaign a head start on building up a national organization, but it also allowed the campaign leadership to map out a message for the early weeks of the general election. The map has included a campaign kickoff just days after the one-year anniversary of Osama bin Laden\u2019s death, a huge push by the president on the issue of student loans and an aggressive attempt to define Romney as out of touch with the struggles of middle-class Americans. Even the president\u2019s recent announcement that he now supports same-sex marriage appears to have been scheduled as a part of the campaign\u2019s rollout. Senior advisers to the president say Obama was always planning to announce his new position before the Democratic convention in September, probably at a time when his Democratic base needed energizing. But the timing of the announcement was moved up after Vice President Joe Biden told NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d on Sunday that he supported same-sex marriage. Since their candidate effectively secured the nomination, Team Romney has been forced to keep pace with an Obama message machine that\u2019s been up and running in some form or another since 2007, all while rapidly hiring staff and building its own nationwide organization to compete in November. In the first week after Romney became the de facto Republican nominee, the president\u2019s re-election campaign bought airtime in swing states to run a negative television ad attacking Romney\u2019s image as a job creator. A week later, it released another ad, this time largely ignoring the opposition and focusing instead on the difficult economic situation Obama inherited in 2009 and the jobs created in the three years since. The team in Chicago also posted more than half a dozen campaign videos on its website, each raising questions about Romney\u2019s positions or trying to undermine Romney attacks against Obama. As for the president himself, by the time polls closed April 24, he had already embarked on a three-state college tour to rally support for legislation that would prevent interest rates on federal student loans from doubling. This public push forced Romney to come out in favor of congressional action to extend the lower rates \u2013 a day ahead of Republican leaders on Capitol Hill. To highlight the president\u2019s national security record, one of his strongest issues with independent voters, Obama for America released a video narrated by former President Bill Clinton extolling Obama\u2019s decision to order the 2011 raid that killed bin Laden and questioning whether Romney would have made the same move. A few days later, the president made a surprise trip to Afghanistan, addressing a crowd of servicemen and -women and delivering a speech to the nation from Bagram Air Base on the future of U.S. involvement in the region. While many Republicans griped that these actions unfairly politicized the military, veteran political strategist Mark McKinnon said that by publicly complaining, they merely assured that more attention would be paid to an issue helpful to the president. \u201cI think Team Obama has come out of the gates aggressively in an effort to try and frame the race early on their terms,\u201d said McKinnon, a co-founder of the nonpartisan group No Labels and a former adviser to the presidential campaigns of George W. Bush and John McCain. Senior Obama campaign adviser David Axelrod said his team had been mapping out the campaign for a year \u201cand have been planning to take this next step and ramp up to this next step for some time, and so we\u2019re fulfilling our plan for this campaign.\u201d The plan, as laid out by the campaign and executed by its candidate, seems to hinge on convincing voters that the president is fighting for middle-class Americans, whereas Romney would fight only for corporations and the wealthy. At a recent campaign kickoff event in Ohio, Obama focused his economic message almost entirely on these populist themes. He decried corporate greed on Wall Street and Republican-supported tax breaks for the wealthiest Americans while expressing empathy for struggling middle-class families trying to keep up with rising costs while incomes shrink. \u201cWe measure prosperity not just by our total GDP, not just by how many billionaires we produce, but how well the typical family is doing: whether they can go as far as their dreams and hard work will take them,\u201d Obama said. This narrative helps the president frame Romney as his opposite: a defender of the upper class who, as the president said in Ohio, \u201csincerely believes that if CEOs and wealthy investors like him make money, the rest of us will automatically prosper as well.\u201d \u201cThe challenge we faced for over a decade is that harder work hasn\u2019t led to higher incomes,\u201d Obama said. \u201cIt\u2019s that bigger profits haven\u2019t led to better jobs. Governor Romney doesn\u2019t seem to get that. He doesn\u2019t seem to understand that maximizing profits by whatever means necessary \u2013 whether through layoffs or outsourcing or tax avoidance or union-busting \u2013 might not always be good for the average American or for the American economy.\u201d For its part, the Romney campaign has been laser-focused on jobs, a strategy that helped many Republican politicians claim victory in 2009 and 2010. Nearly every statement released by Romney\u2019s team in Boston includes a reference to the nation\u2019s unemployment rate, and during the primary, Romney regularly trumpeted his record of job creation in the private sector. The strategy worked in that many polls show that most voters trust Romney more than Obama on issues of the economy, but it also played into the Obama campaign\u2019s efforts to paint Romney as pro-business rather than pro-middle class. Now that the general election has begun in earnest, Romney seems to be making more of an effort to fight that perception. \u201cWe are seeing a greater and greater gap between those that have the most and those that have the least,\u201d Romney said recently at an event in New Hampshire, touching on a favorite theme of the Obama campaign. \u201cThe president\u2019s focused on taking away from those that have the least. I want to help everybody particularly those that are being left behind. I want to help the poor. I want to help the middle class get the kinds of jobs that raise their income. Let\u2019s focus on helping the people who need the help the most.\u201d Charlie Black, a veteran Republican strategist and informal adviser to the Romney campaign, said these efforts by Romney to tell stories that went largely untold during the primary will increase in the coming weeks. This will probably mean more biographical details will be unveiled to help introduce Romney to voters. While Black sees the Obama campaign\u2019s rollout as \u201cwell-choreographed,\u201d he points to the tightness of recent national polls as evidence that Obama\u2019s \u201cclass warfare\u201d strategy hasn\u2019t been entirely effective. \u201cIt\u2019s been two weeks \u2013 three weeks if you go back to when Santorum dropped out \u2013 and Romney\u2019s already getting 90% of the GOP vote,\u201d Black said. \u201cI would\u2019ve guessed Obama would\u2019ve been up 8 points by now, and by June, we could\u2019ve caught up. \u201cRomney should still be nursing his wounds from the primary, but he\u2019s not.\u201d Black, who\u2019s been involved in every Republican presidential campaign since 1976, sees some similarities between Obama\u2019s task this year and the uphill climb that George W. Bush faced in 2004. At the start of Bush\u2019s re-election campaign, he was personally popular, but the economy was slowing, and voters were growing tired of fighting an increasingly protracted war in Iraq. \u201cWe used to have a fairly large pool of voters who liked Bush but didn\u2019t approve of his job performance. That\u2019s what Obama\u2019s got now,\u201d Black said, citing a recent Politico-GW Battleground Poll that found 24% of registered voters fit that description. \u201cThat pool of voters in Bush\u2019s case mostly went for Kerry. So the likeability part isn\u2019t as good an indicator as the job approval part.\u201d The Battleground Poll supports Black\u2019s view of history. Of those voters who like Obama but don\u2019t approve of his performance as president, 68% say they will vote to replace him in November. \u201cDespite moving aggressively, however, they have to be concerned that the race looks like a jump ball when Romney is arguably at his most vulnerable,\u201d McKinnon said of the Obama re-election team. \u201cThe challenge for Obama is that his fate is almost entirely dependent on one variable: the economy.\u201d While economic indicators are trending in the right direction for Team Obama, Black said that many voters make up their mind on their personal economic situation early in an election year, and that perception can be hard to change regardless of how the overall economy improves.",

            "article_content": "The jobs report is the most important monthly economic report in the White House race Obama on report: \"There are still a lot of folks out of work, which means we gotta do more\" Romney: \"It's a terrible and very disappointing report\" CNN poll indicates Americans were split on who could best jump start the economy Hands down, it\u2019s the most important monthly economic report in the race for the White House. And April\u2019s numbers from the Labor Department didn\u2019t provide President Obama a lot to brag about. \u201cAfter the worst economic crisis since the Great Depression, our businesses have now created more than 4.2 million new jobs over the last 26 months, more than 1 million jobs in the six months alone. So that\u2019s the good news,\u201d Obama said Friday at an event in northern Virginia. But the president went on to say, \u201cThere are still a lot of folks out of work, which means we gotta do more. If we\u2019re going to recover all the jobs lost during the recession, and if we\u2019re going to build a secure economy that strengthens the middle class, then we\u2019re going to have to do more.\u201d Romney: Jobs numbers no cause for cheers Breakdown of the April jobs reports Consider this: No sitting president facing an unemployment rate more than 8% has won another term since Franklin D. Roosevelt. So the headline from the Labor Department report Friday morning that the nation\u2019s unemployment level edged down from 8.2% in March to 8.1% in April sure seemed like good news for an incumbent president fighting for re-election. Especially since just about every poll indicates that the economy remains the top issue on the minds of Americans and that jobs remain the top economic concern. CNNMoney.com: Why Obama can\u2019t match the Reagan recovery But the Labor Department also reported that the number of jobs rose last month by 115,000, much lower than many economists had predicted. According to the report, 342,000 workers dropped out of the labor force, with the labor force participation rate, now at 63.6%, at its lowest level since 1981. The presumptive Republican presidential nominee was quick to react to the jobs numbers. \u201cIt\u2019s a terrible and very disappointing report this morning. Clearly the American people are wondering why this recovery isn\u2019t happening faster, what\u2019s taking years and years for the recovery to occur. And we seem to be slowing down, not speeding up. This is not progress,\u201d Mitt Romney said Friday in an interview on Fox News just minutes after the 8:30 a.m. ET release of the Labor Department report. Romney says no celebration until 4% unemployment rate \u201cA lot of American people are having difficult times, and this is not good news this morning,\u201d added the former Massachusetts governor, who argued the reason the rate dropped was because more people are leaving the workforce. Republicans quick to react to jobs report Romney\u2019s strategy is simple: Make the election a referendum on the president\u2019s record on the economy and jobs, and argue that Obama isn\u2019t doing a good job on creating jobs. With six months to go until Election Day, a top Republican strategist says the jobs report spells trouble for the president. \u201cA disappointing jobs report means two things: One, President Obama is more likely to lose his job. Now, this election will increasingly become a referendum on Obama\u2019s performance. Voters may or may not believe Mitt Romney can turn things around, but it is becoming clearer that Obama\u2019s plan isn\u2019t going to cut it,\u201d says GOP strategist and CNN contributor Alex Castellanos. \u201cTwo, to win, President Obama has to run the most brutal, negative, polarizing campaign in history \u2013 on every subject but the economy. He has to pit young against old, rich against poor, women against men, and try to divide the country on other issues. I don\u2019t think that\u2019s the kind of country we want to be,\u201d said Castellanos, who was a top media adviser for Romney\u2019s 2008 nomination bid. \u201cAnytime you have to explain bad news, you\u2019ve already lost. The Obama campaign has done the best they can with stubbornly high unemployment, talking about the number of jobs created and not the number of people who don\u2019t have jobs. But this doesn\u2019t help the general sense of unease about the economy among middle class Americans,\u201d says Rich Galen, who ran Newt Gingrich\u2019s press operation when he was speaker of the House and advised Fred Thompson\u2019s 2008 Republican presidential bid. But be careful what you wish for, says Democratic strategist and CNN contributor Paul Begala. \u201cEvery time there\u2019s bad economic news for the middle class, the Champagne corks pop at one of Mitt Romney\u2019s many mansions. The bad job numbers are bad news for President Obama \u2013 and for all Americans. So the GOP has to be careful not to celebrate bad times,\u201d says Begala, who was a top adviser in the Clinton White House and who now is a senior adviser to Priorities USA, the pro-Obama super PAC. So which candidate does the public think will do a better job turning things around? A CNN/ORC International poll conducted last month indicated that Americans were split on which candidate could best jumpstart the economy, with 44% saying Obama would be more likely to get the economy moving and 42% saying that Romney would do a better job to stimulate the economy. But the race for the White House is a battle for states and their electoral votes. And in two of the biggest and arguably most important battleground states, new surveys from Quinnipiac University indicate that when it comes to the economy, Romney has a slight advantage over the president. Keep your eyes on the monthly unemployment reports between now and November. The numbers will be extremely telling.",

In his continuing push to extend the current 3.4% interest rate charged on federal student loans, Obama told students at a Virginia high school that the goal is to provide all Americans with the best possible education. \u201cWe can\u2019t price the middle class out of a higher education,\u201d the president said, sounding a theme of his re-election campaign. \u201cThat\u2019s why we\u2019ve got to make college more affordable.\u201d He made no mention of Mitt Romney, his all-but-certain opponent in November, but took aim at House Republicans who passed a measure last week that would pay for extending the lower student loan rate by cutting from a health care fund that promotes preventive care. Obama and Senate Democrats want to pay the measure\u2019s $6 billion cost by eliminating some corporate tax loopholes. In remarks almost identical to previous speeches to college students on the issue, Obama said America is not about a few people doing well while everyone else struggles. \u201cAmerica\u2019s about giving everybody a chance to do well,\u201d he said to applause and cheers. \u201cThat\u2019s what makes it strong.

            "article_content": "Four years ago, Bill Clinton was the biggest and most vocal supporter of Hillary Clinton Now, the former president will be a high-profile surrogate for President Obama Bill Clinton recently appeared in a buzzworthy Obama campaign web video Clinton can help Obama by reminding voters of better economic times If case you had any doubts, don\u2019t \u2013 Bill Clinton\u2019s fully on board President Barack Obama\u2019s re-election effort. \u201cBarack Obama deserves to be re-elected president of the United States,\u201d the former president said Sunday night, as he joined the current officeholder at a fundraiser for the Obama re-election campaign. It was a very different story four years ago, when Clinton was the biggest and most vocal supporter of his wife, Hillary Clinton, in her historic battle against Obama for the Democratic presidential nomination. Clinton was a critic of then-Sen. Obama, arguing that the freshman senator wasn\u2019t ready to handle the duties of the Oval Office. Among Clinton\u2019s most controversial comments came when he challenged Obama\u2019s claim to be more against the Iraq War than Hillary Clinton. \u201cGive me a break. This whole thing is the biggest fairy tale I\u2019ve ever seen,\u201d the former president said at the time. But that was then. After Hillary Clinton ended her bid for the nomination, she and her husband took to the campaign trail to help Obama win the White House. The rest is history:  Sen. Obama became President Obama and Sen. Clinton became Secretary of State Clinton. Now, as Obama runs for a second term in the White House, Bill Clinton will once again serve as one of the current president\u2019s most high-profile surrogates. \u201cI think he is beating the historical standard for coming out of a financial collapse and a mortgage collapse. I think the last thing you want to do is to turn around and embrace the policies that got us into trouble in the first place,\u201d Clinton said at the Sunday fundraiser at the Virginia home of former Democratic National Committee Chairman Terry McAuliffe, a longtime member of the Clinton inner circle. \u201cWe need to keep going forward by re-electing Barack Obama president of the United States.\u201d Later, at the same event, Obama praised his predecessor and joked that \u201cyou guys get two presidents for one out of this event, which is a pretty good deal.\u201d But it\u2019s not just fundraisers \u2013 the former president had the starring role in an Obama campaign video that generated a lot of buzz after it went up online Friday. \u201cThe president is the decider in chief. Nobody can make that decision for you,\u201d Clinton says in the Web video, discussing Obama\u2019s decision-making process to give the go-ahead to carry out the raid that killed Osama bin Laden. Tuesday is the one-year anniversary of the al Qaeda leader\u2019s death. \u201cLook, he knew what would happen. Suppose the Navy SEALs had gone in there and it hadn\u2019t been bin Laden. Suppose they had been captured or killed. The downside would have been horrible for him, but he reasoned, \u2018I cannot in good conscience do nothing.\u2019 He took the harder and the more honorable path and the one that produced in my opinion the best result,\u201d Clinton adds in the video. The video also questions whether Mitt Romney, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, would have given the same order. An Obama re-election official told CNN, \u201cWhat\u2019s clear is that the Democratic Party is unified for the 2012 campaign,\u201d and added that \u201cPresident Clinton will help raise money for the campaign at three fundraisers and we anticipate more activity on the trail as the election approaches.\u201d The former president can help the current White House occupant in a number of ways: Clinton\u2019s an extremely talented political strategist and surrogate who can campaign for the president in places such as the Rust Belt and parts of rural America where Obama may not be so popular.  With the economy remaining the top issue on the minds of Americans, someone like Clinton touting Obama could remind them of better economic times. \u201cFormer President Clinton represents economic strength in the eyes of most Americans,\u201d Democratic strategist and CNN contributor Paul Begala said. \u201cThere is no one with more economic credibility than President Clinton \u2013 so when he says President Obama will revive the economy and save the middle class, folks listen. I expect to see Clinton making the case all over the country in 2012,\u201d added Begala, who was a top adviser in the Clinton White House and who now is a senior adviser to Priorities USA, the pro-Obama super PAC. Beyond his campaigning and fundraising, Clinton has also come to Obama\u2019s aid in his elder statesmen missions for the Obama administration in Haiti and North Korea. And while offering constructive criticism of some of Obama\u2019s actions in the first two years of his presidency in his 2011 book \u201cBack to Work,\u201d Clinton also makes the case for the Obama White House and appears to mark a warmer relationship between the two men. Expect the requests for Bill Clinton to keep coming. A source close to the former president points out that since Hillary Clinton\u2019s role as secretary of state will continue to keep her off the campaign trail this cycle, the former president will be busier than ever. Of course, there appears to be something in this equation for Clinton too. By lending Obama a helping hand, Clinton continues to erase any lingering bad memories from the Clinton-Obama clash during the 2008 primaries. And just in case his wife decides to make another bid for the White House in 2016 (never say never), helping Team Obama now could pay dividends in four years.",

            "article_content": "West entered Congress as one of the most notable faces from the tea party movement He has claimed a large part of the House Democratic caucus was communist West is seeking re-election in a newly drawn congressional district Democratic challenger on West: \"There's no middle ground with him\" Few freshmen congressmen have found themselves in the glare of the spotlight as often as Florida Rep. Allen West. Known for his outspokenness, West rarely backs down from a political fight. Some say he picks them. The former Army officer now faces a fight on three fronts. Redistricting carved up the district he flipped from Democrats in 2010; he\u2019ll have to get past a Republican challenger who says he thinks the confrontational politics West practices contribute to the logjam in Congress; and a Democratic opponent who says he was compelled to run against West because of the divisiveness he represents in Congress. But what some see as divisive, West sees as doing the job that voters hired him to do. \u201cI am willing to work with anyone that wants to do what is best for this country,\u201d he said, \u201c(But) when I go back and I look at when President Obama was in the White House, Speaker Pelosi ran the House and (Sen.) Harry Reid had the Senate, I never heard about bipartisanship. I never heard the word \u2018compromise\u2019 used. So I\u2019m starting to believe that these terms only come into play to try and force Republicans to do what the Democrats want,\u201d West continued. \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything divisive about me.\u201d Rep. West avoids naming Communist reps West entered Congress as one of the most notable faces from the tea party movement that helped Republicans make the biggest shift in the balance of power in the House in more than 60 years. He\u2019s become better known for his blunt style of making a point. He has claimed a large part of the House Democratic caucus was communist, called Democratic National Committee Chairwoman and Florida Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz \u201cvile, unprofessional and despicable,\u201d and said other Democratic leaders should take their message of \u201cequality of achievement\u201d and \u201cget the hell out of the United States.\u201d He also compared the movement that helped propel him to office with the movie \u201cThe Blob.\u201d He has sponsored nine bills, including an effort to provide tax credits to small businesses that hire the unemployed, and two resolutions aimed at reducing appropriations to the Department of Defense for printing, reproduction, studies, analysis and evaluations, though none has yet made it out of committee. He has co-sponsored 274 other bills. But it\u2019s his controversial comments that have gotten him the most attention. \u2018There\u2019s no middle ground with him\u2019 \u201cPeople are not following the progress of a congressman on a day-to-day basis,\u201d said Gregory Koger, a  University of Miami political science professor. \u201cThey don\u2019t have the time or the interest, but they do have a general impression that Congress doesn\u2019t seem to be accomplishing much because there\u2019s a great deal of conflict and disagreement.\u201d Koger said that could help lay the groundwork for a strong challenge to West by a Democrat \u201cbecause of this very conservative class of Republicans who prefer conflict to compromise.\u201d The district West has represented was carved up when Florida gained two districts after the 2010 Census and  West chose to move north to a newly drawn district. Democrat Patrick Murphy picked up and followed, leaving West\u2019s old 22nd Congressional District \u2013 where he began his challenge to West \u2013 and moved to the new 18th District. \u201cIt\u2019s not the run-of-the-mill Republican we\u2019re going against,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cIt\u2019s Allen West. There\u2019s no middle ground with him \u2013 people love him or hate him.\u201d West served in the Army for nearly 20 years but an incident in Iraq in which he was accused of firing his pistol near the head of an Iraqi detainee to try to get information from him about an impending attack led to his leaving the service. He moved his family from Texas to Florida, where he hoped to start a new life. The new district retains about 20% of West\u2019s old one and includes swaths of retirement communities and agricultural land.  Portions of the district include large numbers of older voters as well as affluent residents, many of them transplants. \u201cA lot of that area is made up of new Floridians,\u201d Koger said. \u201cIt\u2019s interesting for Allen West for two reasons: He doesn\u2019t have deep Florida roots. He was in the military for most of his career, left the military, spent three years as a civilian in Florida, and then ran for office. That\u2019s not going to matter with the population that doesn\u2019t have these long, deep ties to Florida. If the population itself is largely composed of transplants, they\u2019re not going to care as much. \u201cAnd, on the other hand, his military background and the rhetoric will probably do well in (a portion of St. Lucie County) that will appreciate his credentials and his military background.\u201d Challenge on the flank West must first win an August Republican primary against Martin County Sheriff Bob Crowder, who says he, too, is challenging West chiefly because of his in-your-face brand of politics. \u201cProblems in our country are largely because Congress is not communicating with itself and things seem to be in a logjam,\u201d Crowder said. \u201cWest is a fine fellow, but he is very confrontational and I think it\u2019s time for members of Congress to pull together and listen to one another and negotiate with the other party instead of calling them communists.\u201d The National Republican Congressional Committee is throwing its weight behind West, picking his campaign for its Patriot Program, an effort to support Republican members in competitive races targeted by Democrats. Indeed, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee selected the West-Murphy matchup for its Red to Blue program, which is designed to target the most vulnerable Republican incumbents. The nonpartisan Cook Political Report rates the race as a toss-up. Voters gave President Barack Obama a slight edge in 2008, but the same area broke narrowly for President George W. Bush in 2004. Cook\u2019s David Wasserman describes the district as \u201cevenly divided between the parties.\u201d \u201cOnly 20-25% (of the new district) is carried over from West\u2019s old district, which he only represented for one Congress,\u201d Koger said. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like he\u2019s running for an open seat. He\u2019ll have to introduce himself to a large portion of the district.\u201d Murphy and West both identify core issues of job creation and the economy as critical in the race. Both list environmental concerns specific to Florida, like Everglades restoration, as a focus. But for Murphy, a CPA who left his accounting firm to start a small business, his opponent is also an issue. \u201cHe\u2019s part of the reason I got into this in the beginning,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cThe extremism. Definitely running against him and beating him is something that I\u2019m very passionate about.\u201d West spent part of the spring congressional recess traveling in and around the new district. \u201cIt\u2019s not so much introducing myself \u2013 most people are aware of who I am \u2013 but getting more (of a) personal touch. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve been out to small businesses and had listening tours and town hall meetings. We had a good balance in continuing to service our constituents in Congressional District 22 and getting the concerns of people in Congressional District 18,\u201d he said. Communists among the Democrats One of those town halls set off the most recent firestorm around West. When asked what percentage of the \u201cAmerican legislature\u201d he believed were \u201ccard-carrying Marxists or international socialists,\u201d West responded, \u201cIt\u2019s a good question. I believe there\u2019s about 78 to 81 members of the Democrat Party who are members of the Communist Party.\u201d After a pause filled with murmurs among the assembled crowd, West continued, \u201cIt\u2019s called the Congressional Progressive Caucus.\u201d The caucus responded, \u201cAllen West is denigrating the millions of Americans who voted to elect Congressional Progressive Caucus members, and he is ignoring the oath they took to protect and defend the U.S. Constitution \u2014 just like he did.\u201d It also asked the voters of FL-22 to \u201cnote that he repeatedly polarizes the American people.\u201d The Communist Party dismissed West\u2019s claim as a \u201cridiculous statement.\u201d While he said he doesn\u2019t really believe that members of the Congressional Progressive Caucus are communists, he insisted, \u201cI call it as it is.\u201d \u201cThere\u2019s a thin line along the political spectrum of ideologies when you look at communism, Marxism, socialism, progressivism,\u201d he continued. \u201cI\u2019m just saying this: They share the exact same strategies and tactics across the board from those ideologies. \u201cI guess people are mad because I said it.\u201d Republican Martin County Commissioner Patrick Hayes, who was present at the town hall, said West was connecting with his audience. \u201cHe was speaking to a very favorable crowd,\u201d said Hayes, who is also up for re-election and isn\u2019t taking sides in the West-Crowder race. \u201cCertainly by the standard that most people speak, of a communist cardholder, etc, that doesn\u2019t seem to me to be accurate at all in terms of people up in Washington, or the Democrats.\u201d \u201cBasically, he was talking to his audience and it got out of hand,\u201d he said. For Murphy, the incident was more fodder for his campaign. \u201cIn light of his recent comments we\u2019ve had a nice reminder to people of who he is and what he stands for,\u201d Murphy said. West may have found a friendly audience in the roughly 100-person crowd in Martin County, but he simultaneously played to the biggest grievance of his competition. \u201cOne of the big issues is Allen West\u2019s verbal explosions, where he continually says extremely divisive things,\u201d said Eric Johnson, Murphy\u2019s campaign consultant. \u201cIt is a campaign issue because he keeps embarrassing himself in the district and he\u2019s also so divisive that he makes it impossible for people to work across the aisle with him to get things done.\u201d West maintains he is doing what he was elected to do. \u201cI am doing what I know allows me to look at myself at the end of the day and not say that I went out and lied to the American people.\u201d How will \u2018take-no-prisoner\u2019 style  play among independents? University of South Florida political science professor Susan MacManus said the role of swing voters will be critical in the race. \u201cI think much of it is going to depend upon how well the Allen West \u2018take-no-prisoners\u2019 style plays with that constituency \u2013 sometimes (that) style doesn\u2019t really fit well with older voters. \u201cHe\u2019s certainly the tea party guy in terms of the things they\u2019re interested in.  The thing that resonates in my judgment of his policy is that part of his persona now is the deficit and government spending and the whole loss of America\u2019s place in the world. Being a military guy, he articulates that well,\u201d MacManus continued. \u201cI think this race comes down to more, the kind of persona, public persona, the person has. So if West gets to the point of where this publicity is highly embarrassing, that will certainly help Murphy.  But it is an older constituency and they are very concerned about economics,\u201d she said. With West showing no signs of playing to the middle and Murphy, who has admitted to voting for both Republicans and Democrats, doing just that, funds are rolling in. \u201cEach of them is the other\u2019s best fundraiser,\u201d MacManus said. Among Democrats seeking to unseat Republican challengers, Murphy\u2019s campaign says he is one of the top three fundraisers, boasting a haul of $1.75 million since he launched his campaign a year ago. In mid-April West announced that his campaign earned $1.8 million in the first quarter of this year, for a total of $3.3 million in cash-on-hand. \u201cI think everyone knows who I am and what I stand for \u2026 the question should be who is he, and is he just another political opportunist looking for this ability to get his name out there?\u201d West said. Murphy countered, \u201cHe\u2019s definitely branded himself.\u201d",

            "article_content": "NEW: Obama jabs at auto bailout opponents, a group that included Romney NEW: Obama campaign aide downplays his \"silver spoon\" remark Indiana Gov. Mitch Daniels endorses Romney Romney visits North Carolina, criticizes Obama's golf outings Mitt Romney got another expected but key endorsement from Indiana Gov. Mitch Daniels on Wednesday before heading to North Carolina to criticize President Barack Obama in the North Carolina city where Democrats will nominate Obama later this year for a second term. Meanwhile, at appearances in Michigan and Ohio, Obama made some references that could easily be construed as jabs at his presumed Republican opponent\u2019s privileged upbringing and his position on the auto industry bailout. Romney, speaking near the outdoor stadium in Charlotte where Obama will deliver his speech accepting the Democratic nomination in September, listed what he called failed administration policies that he said would not get mentioned by the president. \u201cHe has failed by the measurements he set,\u201d said Romney. \u201cYou won\u2019t hear that at this convention, but you\u2019re going to hear it at ours, I\u2019ll tell you that.\u201d In an apparent reference to polls that showed Obama was considered more likable, Romney cracked: \u201cEven if you like Barack Obama, we can\u2019t afford Barack Obama.\u201d Earlier, Romney echoed some of the less serious criticisms of Obama launched by the political right, complaining that the president plays golf too often. Ted Nugent: Obama admin 'vile, evil' Bachmann wants to be voice to unite GOP Romney slams Obama on 'Buffett Rule' \u201cI scratch my head at the capacity of the president to take four hours off on such a regular basis to go golfing,\u201d Romney said in an interview on WLW radio in Ohio. \u201cI remember how the Democrats used to be so critical of George W. Bush for playing occasional golf. He doesn\u2019t begin to play the kind of golf that Barack Obama has, but we don\u2019t hear much about that from the mainstream media.\u201d Romney, who said on WTVN radio in Ohio that he intends to spend a day or two at the London Olympics this summer, still needs several hundred delegates to clinch the Republican nomination but his path cleared last week when conservative challenger Rick Santorum dropped out. Obama\u2019s campaign has long considered Romney the likely opponent in November, and the president has started making references, both obvious and oblique, to the multimillionaire former Massachusetts governor in his speeches. Talking about job training at a community college in Ohio, Obama criticized a House Republican budget plan embraced by Romney that would cut funding for programs to help young people go to college. \u201cSomebody gave me an education,\u201d Obama said in reference to his and the first lady\u2019s middle-class background. \u201cI wasn\u2019t born with a silver spoon in my mouth. Michelle wasn\u2019t. But somebody gave us a chance.\u201d An Obama campaign aide downplayed any potential reference to Romney, noting that the president has used the expression in the past. In Dearborn, Michigan, the president defended his 2009 authorization of the massive auto bailout while indirectly smacking Romney for opposing the plan. Standing on the same stage at the Henry Ford Museum where Romney announced his first bid for president in 2008, Obama told a crowd of some 600 enthusiastic supporters: \u201cChange is the decision we made to rescue the American auto industry from collapse when some politicians said, \u2018Let Detroit go bankrupt.\u2019 \u201d Romney, who was born in Michigan and whose father was a former auto executive and governor of the state, opposed the bailout, saying a structured bankruptcy could have achieved the same result without the massive cost to the U.S. government. Moreover, he has argued the Obama administration made too many concessions to auto unions as part of the bailout. The election campaign is intensifying now that it is essentially a two-man race. Romney has been rolling out endorsements this week in the aftermath of Santorum\u2019s departure from the Republican campaign. Daniels, at one time considered a possible GOP contender, explained Wednesday on Fox News why he is backing Romney. \u201cHe\u2019s already won our nomination. He earned it,\u201d the Indiana governor said. \u201cHe\u2019s proven himself the best nominee we can put forward, and I\u2019m just happy to sign on and help.\u201d In his own statement, Romney said Daniels shares his background in business and has \u201cused the principles of the private sector in government.\u201d \u201cIndiana has been served well by his leadership based on fiscal discipline, smaller government, and a friendly environment for job creators,\u201d Romney said. \u201cI am honored to have his support.\u201d The Daniels endorsement followed similar public support for Romney on Tuesday from the top two Republicans in Congress as well as Republican governors from Pennsylvania and Wyoming, showing the party\u2019s intention to rally around their certain nominee and shift the focus of the campaign from the GOP primary race to November\u2019s election. After his Ohio address, Obama planned to return to the fundraising circuit Wednesday with events in Michigan, where Romney was born. One of the two planned events will be at the Henry Ford Museum in Dearborn, the Obama campaign said. The Ford Museum was where Romney announced his first bid for president in 2008. Wednesday\u2019s fundraisers come on the heels of the Obama campaign\u2019s announcement that it gathered $53 million last month, $8 million more than it took in during February. A new poll Tuesday showed voters are willing to give Romney a fresh look now that he is the certain Republican nominee. The CNN/ORC International poll showed that Romney\u2019s popularity is starting to rebound now that the divisiveness of the Republican primaries appears to be all but over. According to the survey, 44% of people questioned said they have a favorable view of Romney, up 10 points from February, while 43% said they have an unfavorable opinion, down 11 points, and 13% were unsure. The survey said 53% of Americans plan to give Romney a second look when the primaries are officially over, with 45% saying they already know enough about Romney to decide whether he would be a good president. It also indicated that Romney\u2019s popularity still lags well behind Obama\u2019s: 56% have a favorable view of the president, with 42% saying they see Obama in a negative light. \u201cThe Republican Party\u2019s favorable rating has also rebounded now that the nomination fight is all but over, from 35% in March to 41%,\u201d said CNN Polling Director Keating Holland. \u201cThat still puts the GOP several points behind the Democratic party\u2019s 46% rating, but it is an indication that the wounds have started to heal from the primary season.\u201d Both House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, and Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky said Tuesday they back Romney\u2019s nomination. The statements a few hours apart were intended to show growing Republican support for Romney despite mistrust among some conservatives over his moderate policies when he was Massachusetts governor. \u201cI will be proud to support Mitt Romney and do everything I can to help him win,\u201d Boehner told reporters after he met with House Republicans to discuss the November election. McConnell later told reporters he also is backing Romney, which is no surprise but represents a formal endorsement after the Kentucky senator previously said Romney would be the party\u2019s nominee and \u201can excellent candidate.\u201d CNN\u2019s Tom Cohen, Alexander Mooney and Gabriella Schwarz contributed to this report.",

In remarks to a media convention that Obama addressed the day before, Romney responded to the president\u2019s harsh attacks on Republicans by accusing Obama of trying to divert attention from his own failed record through \u201cstraw men\u201d arguments. Citing Obama\u2019s recent comment to Russia\u2019s president, caught by a still-live microphone, that he could be more flexible after his re-election in November, Romney told the gathering of newspaper publishers and editors that the incident \u201ccalls his candor into serious question.\u201d \u201cHe does not want to share his real plans before the election, either with the public or with the press,\u201d Romney said. \u201cBy flexibility, he means that \u2018what the American public doesn\u2019t know won\u2019t hurt him.\u2019  He is intent on hiding. You and I will have to do the seeking.\u201d Analysis: Romney\u2019s focus shifts to fall fight Romney also took aim at Obama\u2019s speech Tuesday, saying the president \u201crailed against arguments no one is making \u2013 and criticized policies no one is proposing.\u201d\u201cIt\u2019s one of his favorite strategies \u2013 setting up straw men to distract from his record,\u201d Romney said, later adding: \u201cWith all the challenges the nation faces, this is not the time for President Obama\u2019s hide-and-seek campaign.\u201d Obama looking ahead to Romney? Pawlenty: Santorum 'lashing out' Romney: Obama can't run from record Santorum: 'Pennsylvania, you know me' The competing speeches effectively launched the fall presidential campaign, pitting the Democratic president running on a populist theme of sticking up for the middle class against the Republican businessman and former Massachusetts governor proposing traditional GOP policies of smaller government, lower taxes and less regulation to drive economic growth. \u201cAlmost every measure that the president has taken made it harder for small business to decide to grow in America or for big business to stay here,\u201d Romney said of Obama in response to questions after his speech. \u201cI don\u2019t think that is what the president intended it to do but that is what it has done.\u201d Overall, Romney said, \u201cI don\u2019t think this has been a great presidency.\u201d While economic recovery has taken root after the 2008 recession, Romney scoffed that it only happened after \u201c3\u00bd years\u201d and the expiration of government stimulus programs championed by Obama. \u201cEvery recession ends and people get back to work,\u201d Romney said, repeating a line from the campaign trail that this recovery has been the slowest in U.S. history. Obama attacks GOP budget proposal On Tuesday, Obama delivered what amounted to his strongest campaign speech so far and referred to Romney by name for the first time in an address. In attacking a Republican budget plan passed by the U.S. House of Representatives, Obama said that \u201cone of my potential opponents, Gov. Romney, has said that he hoped a similar version of this plan from last year would be introduced on day one of his presidency\u201d and that Romney was \u201cvery supportive of this new budget.\u201d To Obama, the Republican proposal prepared by House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan of Wisconsin is a \u201cTrojan horse\u201d disguised as a deficit reduction plan that actually imposes a \u201cradical vision\u201d far to the right of the party\u2019s mainstream heroes such as Ronald Reagan. \u201cIt is thinly veiled social Darwinism,\u201d Obama said. \u201cIt is antithetical to our entire history as a land of opportunity and upward mobility for everyone who\u2019s willing to work for it \u2013 a place where prosperity doesn\u2019t trickle down from the top, but grows outward from the heart of the middle class.\u201d He added that \u201cby gutting the very things we need to grow an economy that\u2019s built to last \u2013 education and training, research and development, infrastructure \u2013 it\u2019s a prescription for decline.\u201d The $3.5 trillion Ryan budget plan for 2013 would lower tax rates and cut spending while reforming the Medicare and Medicaid government-run health care programs for senior citizens, the disabled and the poor. Ryan and other conservatives say  major reforms are needed to subdue increasing federal deficits and debt, with particular focus on entitlement programs that are the main contributors to the budget imbalance. Romney: We won victory to restore America McCain: Santorum 'irrelevant' in race Obama laughs at 'marvelous' Romney Santorum has eyes on Pennsylvania For example, the Ryan budget would convert federal Medicaid funding for states into block grants. Such a step could increase the cost burden on states, but would give them more autonomy about how to set up their Medicaid programs. As a result, a state could reduce how many people are eligible or increase enrollees\u2019 cost-sharing obligations. Obama blamed a polarized political climate for an inability to make progress on such key issues as deficit reduction and entitlement reform, arguing that the Republican shift to the right rejected moderate proposals acceptable to Democrats. \u201cThe problem right now is not the technical means to solve it. The problem is our politics, and that\u2019s part of what this election and what this debate will need to be about,\u201d Obama said. \u201cAre we, as a country, willing to get back to commonsense, balanced, fair solutions that encourage our long-term economic growth and stabilize our budget?\u201d He took particular aim at the Ryan budget proposal\u2019s tax reforms, spending cuts and entitlement reforms, which Obama said would shift the burden of deficit reduction to the middle class, senior citizens and the poor. \u201cIn this country, broad-based prosperity has never trickled down from the success of a wealthy few,\u201d Obama said. \u201cIt has always come from the success of a strong and growing middle class.\u201d Romney said Wednesday that Obama\u2019s criticisms were off-base, noting for example that the president\u2019s projected deep cuts to discretionary spending were based on an across-the-board approach that wouldn\u2019t apply. He framed the election as a choice between bigger and costlier government that hinders growth and limits personal freedom, or letting free enterprise restore economic strength. \u201cIf we become one of those societies that attack success, one outcome is certain \u2013 there will be a lot less success,\u201d Romney said. \u201cThat\u2019s not who we are.\u201d Romney\u2019s primary victories Tuesday in Wisconsin, Maryland and Washington, D.C., padded his wide lead in the delegate count over top challenger Rick Santorum and bolstered the sense that Romney has the nomination sewn up. GOP delegate count | Delegate calculator Conservative Sen. John McCain of Arizona said as much Wednesday, telling CNN\u2019s \u201cStarting Point with Soledad O\u2019Brien\u201d that \u201cwhether Rick Santorum stays in or not is now basically irrelevant.\u201d McCain calls Santorum \u2018irrelevant\u2019 Ari Fleischer, a CNN contributor and former George W. Bush White House spokesman, said that Santorum earned the right to fight through Pennsylvania, but the race was all but over. \u201cI think the writing is on the wall. Does Rick Santorum want to read it is the question,\u201d he said. Santorum said Wednesday that he intended to remain in the race.

And we plan on winning here,\u201d Santorum told reporters while campaigning in Pennsylvania, where polls show him holding a narrowing lead. His campaign\u2019s communications director, Hogan Gidley, rejected a suggestion that Santorum would drop out if he fell behind in the polls in Pennsylvania, adding \u201cthis campaign is not poll-driven.\u201d After Pennsylvania, several primaries in May take place in states with large numbers of Christian evangelicals who have supported Santorum elsewhere. \u201cMay looks very, very good,\u201d Santorum said in reference to contests in Indiana, North Carolina, West Virginia, Nebraska and Texas. \u201cThere\u2019s a move \u2026 to make Texas a winner-take-all state,\u201d he added. \u201cYou throw those 154 delegates on our pile and all of a sudden, this race becomes a very different race.\u201d According to CNN estimates, Romney has 654 delegates to 270 for Santorum, while fellow contenders Newt Gingrich and Texas Rep. Ron Paul trail well back.  Romney\u2019s total is 57% of the 1,144 needed to clinch the nomination, and he would have to win 44% of the remaining delegates available to reach that threshold. Obama, meanwhile, clinched the Democratic presidential nomination Tuesday with primary wins in Maryland, the District of Columbia and Wisconsin, CNN projected. Unlike the Republicans, Obama faced no serious opposition in his race, and his nomination was never in doubt.

In attacking a Republican budget plan passed by the U.S. House of Representatives, Obama said that \u201cone of my potential opponents, Gov. Romney, has said that he hoped a similar version of this plan from last year would be introduced on day one of his presidency\u201d and that Romney was \u201cvery supportive of this new budget.\u201d To Obama, the Republican proposal prepared by House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan of Wisconsin is a \u201cTrojan Horse\u201d disguised as a deficit reduction plan that actually imposes a \u201cradical vision\u201d far to the right of the party\u2019s mainstream heroes such as Ronald Reagan. \u201cIt is thinly-veiled Social Darwinism,\u201d Obama said. \u201cIt is antithetical to our entire history as a land of opportunity and upward mobility for everyone who\u2019s willing to work for it \u2013 a place where prosperity doesn\u2019t trickle down from the top, but grows outward from the heart of the middle class.\u201d He added that \u201cby gutting the very things we need to grow an economy that\u2019s built to last \u2013 education and training; research and development; infrastructure \u2013 it\u2019s a prescription for decline.\u201d Obama blamed a polarized political climate for an inability to make progress on such key issues as deficit reduction and entitlement reform, arguing that the Republican shift to the right rejected moderate proposals acceptable to Democrats. \u201cThe problem right now is not the technical means to solve it. The problem is our politics, and that\u2019s part of what this election and what this debate will need to be about,\u201d Obama said. \u201cAre we, as a country, willing to get back to commonsense, balanced, fair solutions that encourage our long-term economic growth and stabilize our budget?\u201d He took particular aim at the Ryan budget proposal\u2019s tax reforms, spending cuts and entitlement reforms, which Obama said would shift the burden of deficit reduction to the middle class, senior citizens and the poor. \u201cIn this country, broad-based prosperity has never trickled down from the success of a wealthy few,\u201d Obama said. \u201cIt has always come from the success of a strong and growing middle class.\u201d Romney responded to Obama\u2019s speech later Tuesday, telling conservative commentator Sean Hannity\u2019s radio program that the president  \u201csays things which are designed to solicit applause and affirmation, but in reality, he does very different things than what he\u2019s saying.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s a disingenuous, fear-mongered approach, which I understand is going to catch a lot of attention,\u201d Romney said. \u201cBut if people dig a little deeper, I think they\u2019re going to understand that this is President Obama being President Obama, which is finding a way to deflect blame and to mischaracterize the efforts on the part of very thoughtful and serious minded individuals.\u201d The $3.5 trillion Ryan budget plan for 2013 plan would lower tax rates and cut spending while reforming the Medicare and Medicaid government-run health care programs for senior citizens, the disabled and the poor. Ryan and other conservatives argue that major reforms are needed to subdue increasing federal deficits and debt, with particular focus on entitlement programs that are the main contributors to the budget imbalance. For example, the Ryan budget would convert federal Medicaid funding for states into block grants. Such a step could increase the cost burden on states, but would give them more autonomy about how to set up their Medicaid programs. As a result, a state could reduce how many people are eligible or increase enrollees\u2019 cost-sharing obligations.

            "article_content": "NEW: Rep. Ryan says President Obama chooses to \"duck and run\" on the budget Obama calls Republican spending plans \"social Darwinism\" Obama advocates shared responsibility through higher taxes on the wealthy Once again, Obama has a high-profile event on a primary election day President Barack Obama launched a major assault Tuesday on the House-passed Republican budget proposal embraced by front-running GOP presidential candidate Mitt Romney, calling it \u201csocial Darwinism\u201d that would stifle the American dream. In a speech to a media luncheon, Obama described the measure \u2013 prepared by House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan, R-Wisconsin, and passed by the House \u2013 as a \u201cTrojan Horse\u201d that is disguised as a deficit reduction plan but actually imposes a \u201cradical vision.\u201d \u201cIt is thinly-veiled Social Darwinism,\u201d Obama said. \u201cIt is antithetical to our entire history as a land of opportunity and upward mobility for everyone who\u2019s willing to work for it \u2013 a place where prosperity doesn\u2019t trickle down from the top, but grows outward from the heart of the middle class.\u201d He added that \u201cby gutting the very things we need to grow an economy that\u2019s built to last \u2013 education and training; research and development; infrastructure \u2013 it\u2019s a prescription for decline.\u201d The remarks signaled Obama\u2019s full engagement in his re-election campaign for the November vote as Romney has seized an apparently solid grip on the Republican nomination. Obama laughs at Romney's expense Obama looking ahead to Romney face-off? Romney: We won victory to restore America For the first time this year, Obama mentioned the former Massachusetts governor by name in a speech, noting Romney\u2019s support for the Ryan budget plan. \u201cOne of my potential opponents, Gov. Romney, has said that he hoped a similar version of this plan from last year would be introduced on day one of his presidency,\u201d Obama said. \u201cHe said that he\u2019s very supportive of this new budget and he even called it marvelous, which is a word you don\u2019t often hear when it comes to describing a budget.\u201d Ryan and other Republican leaders immediately criticized the Obama speech as a politically motivated appeal to populism, rather than a serious approach to budget deficits. \u201cHistory will not be kind to a president who, when it came time to confront our generation\u2019s defining challenge, chose to duck and run,\u201d Ryan said in a statement. \u201cThe president refuses to take responsibility for the economy and refuses to offer a credible plan to address the most predictable economic crisis in our history. Instead, he has chosen tired and cynical political attacks as he focuses on his own re-election.\u201d According to Ryan, Obama used his speech to \u201cdistort the truth and divide Americans in order to distract from his failed record.\u201d Obama, however, blamed a polarized political climate for an inability to make progress on such key issues as deficit reduction and entitlement reform, arguing that Republicans have shifted to the right and dropped support for moderate proposals acceptable to Democrats. \u201cThe problem right now is not the technical means to solve it. The problem is our politics, and that\u2019s part of what this election and what this debate will need to be about,\u201d Obama said in response to a question at the end. \u201cAre we, as a country, willing to get back to commonsense, balanced, fair solutions that encourage our long-term economic growth and stabilize our budget?\u201d Obama has increasingly portrayed the upcoming election as a choice between maintaining his policies and vision for continued economic recovery and investment in future growth versus what he calls failed Republican policies of the past based on deep spending cuts and lower taxes intended to benefit the corporate class. \u201cIn this country, broad-based prosperity has never trickled down from the success of a wealthy few,\u201d Obama said Tuesday. \u201cIt has always come from the success of a strong and growing middle class.\u201d In particular, he focused on the Ryan budget proposal for 2013 recently passed by the Republican-led House. The $3.5 trillion plan would lower tax rates and cut spending while reforming the Medicare and Medicaid government-run health care programs for senior citizens, the disabled and the poor. Ryan and other conservatives argue that major reforms are needed to subdue increasing federal deficits and debt, with particular focus on entitlement programs that are the main contributors to the budget imbalance. For example, the Ryan budget would convert federal Medicaid funding for states into block grants. Such a step could increase the cost burden on states, but would give them more autonomy about how to set up their Medicaid programs. As a result, a state could reduce how many people are eligible or increase enrollees\u2019 cost-sharing obligations. \u201cIf the president were serious, he would put forward a plan to deal with our debt crisis and save Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid for future generations of seniors without raising taxes on small businesses that are struggling in this economy,\u201d House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, said in a statement Tuesday. \u201cInstead, he has chosen to campaign rather than govern, and the debt crisis he is presiding over is only getting worse.\u201d Obama, however, called the Ryan budget an attempt to shift the burden of deficit reduction to the middle class and the needy. He outlined what he said would be cuts in government programs that provide early education, student loans and research grants as examples of the sweep of the GOP proposal. The Ryan plan\u2019s proposal to alter Medicare \u2013 the government health care program for senior citizens \u2013 would provide vouchers to help pay for health coverage rather than the universal plan of today, Obama said. People would have to pay any cost increases or expenses beyond the vouchers, which amounts to shifting the cost burden to senior citizens, the president asserted. \u201cIt\u2019s a bad idea and eventually will end Medicare as we know it,\u201d Obama said in targeting one of the most politically sensitive provisions of the Ryan plan. Obama also criticized tax cuts in the Ryan budget that he said would cost $4.6 trillion over the next decade. Such a move would benefit the wealthy while reducing tax breaks relied on by middle class families, such as the mortgage interest deduction, the president said. \u201cThis is supposed to be about paying down our deficit? It\u2019s laughable,\u201d Obama said. He repeated his longstanding support for a balanced approach to deficit reduction that includes increased tax revenue through higher rates on the wealthy. Obama again called for adoption of the so-called Buffett rule, a proposal that would have all Americans making more than $1 million pay at least a 30% tax rate. The Senate is expected to vote on a form of the proposal named for billionaire Warren Buffett, who has complained that the current tax code allows him to pay a lower tax rate than his secretary. The Obama speech to a luncheon by The Associated Press at the American Society of News Editors convention occurred on the same day as primary elections in Wisconsin, Maryland and the District of Columbia. Obama also scheduled high-profile events on previous primary days this year, including a speech at a United Auto Workers conference on the day of the Michigan primary in February, a news conference on Super Tuesday in early March and a visit to an opening NCAA basketball tournament game with visiting British Prime Minister David Cameron on the night that Alabama and Mississippi voted.

            "article_content": "House of Representatives passes GOP Rep. Paul Ryan's budget plan Ryan budget includes big changes in Medicare, tax code Democrats say the plan would hurt the elderly and middle class They argue that the plan is a betrayal of last year's deficit reduction deal The Republican-controlled House of Representatives on Thursday passed the GOP leadership\u2019s 2013 budget plan \u2013 a measure that has no chance of passing the Democratic-controlled Senate but creates a clear contrast between the two parties on a number of critical tax and spending issues ahead of the general election. The resolution passed in a strongly polarized 228-191 vote.  No Democrats backed the measure; only 10 Republicans opposed it. House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan\u2019s $3.53 trillion blueprint includes an overhaul of the nation\u2019s tax code and major changes to popular entitlements such as Medicare \u2013 expensive programs that in the past have been considered politically untouchable. Why the budget may never be balanced Republicans say the plan is necessary to slow the growth of exploding federal deficits and put the federal government on the road to fiscal stability. Obama targets oil industry tax breaks \u201cWe have one of the most predictable economic crises in this country coming.  It\u2019s a debt-driven crisis.  And so we have an obligation \u2013 not just a legal obligation but a moral obligation \u2013 to do something about it,\u201d Ryan, a Wisconsin Republican, said Thursday morning.  GOP leaders \u201cthink the key components are to get spending under control, reform our entitlement programs\u201d and help stimulate economic growth. Democrats, however, consider the plan a betrayal of last year\u2019s bipartisan deficit reduction deal and a GOP giveaway to the wealthy at the expense of the middle class and vulnerable seniors. \u201cIn our view, we certainly don\u2019t want to return to some of the economic policies that got us into the mess to begin with.  And we are concerned that the Republican budget does that,\u201d said Maryland Rep. Chris Van Hollen, a member of the House Democratic leadership. \u201cIt disrupts the fragile recovery and undercuts investments that are going to be important for the long-term economic strength of the United States of America.\u201d White House Press Secretary Jay Carney released a statement after the vote blasting House Republicans for banding \u201ctogether to shower millionaires and billionaires with a massive tax cut paid for by ending Medicare as we know it and making extremely deep cuts to critical programs needed to create jobs and strengthen the middle class.\u201d Romney garners two endorsements Over the past two days, the sharply divided House has overwhelmingly rejected President Barack Obama\u2019s budget proposal, a House Democratic plan, a more conservative Republican alternative, and a bipartisan blueprint containing controversial spending cuts and tax hikes opposed by majorities in both parties. The blueprint \u2013 derived from proposals advanced by a special commission led by former Clinton White House Chief of Staff Erskine Bowles and former Wyoming GOP Sen. Alan Simpson \u2013 includes roughly $2 trillion in cuts and more than $1 trillion in new tax revenues over the next decade.  The measure failed in a 382-38 vote. While a budget resolution is not binding, it is used to guide congressional appropriators responsible for allocating federal dollars.  Both chambers of Congress have not agreed on such a measure since the spring of 2009. Among other things, the Ryan plan calls for a reduction in individual tax rates and brackets.  Instead of today\u2019s six brackets, with rates from 10% to 35%, it calls for just two: 10% and 25%. The proposal would eliminate the alternative minimum tax while dropping the top corporate tax rate from 35% to 25%. GOP leaders would compensate for lost revenue by closing a series of tax loopholes and ending numerous deductions. They have declined to offer any details, however, on exactly which loopholes and deductions would be affected, instead insisting that the matter will be taken up at the congressional committee level in the future. Returning to one of the most controversial points from last year\u2019s budget fight, the proposal includes dramatic changes to the Medicare program.  It would offer future seniors a choice of staying in the traditional fee-for-service plan or opting instead for a Medicare-approved private plan, all of which would be available via a new Medicare exchange. No matter which plan they chose, including the traditional Medicare plan, seniors would receive a government subsidy to help pay for their choice. While Republicans insist the change is necessary to ensure the program\u2019s long-term fiscal viability, Democrats accuse the GOP of trying to destroy a key legacy of President Lyndon Johnson\u2019s Great Society. The Republicans \u201cwant Medicare to wither on the vine, to die,\u201d House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-California, said this month. Medicaid, which provides health coverage for the poor, would be converted under the GOP plan into a series of block grants for states. Individual states would be empowered to tighten eligibility rules or revise enrollees\u2019 cost-sharing obligations. The GOP proposal also protects defense spending by undoing a scheduled $55 billion cut in the Pentagon budget, replacing the reduction with cuts elsewhere.  Ryan has previously called the scheduled Pentagon cuts \u2013 part of the agreement reached in last summer\u2019s Budget Control Act \u2013 \u201cdevastating to America\u2019s defense capabilities.\u201d On Thursday, Ryan said senior military officials defending lower Pentagon spending proposals have not been honest. \u201cWe don\u2019t think the generals are giving us their true advice,\u201d he said, accusing them of following an administration line. \u201cI think there is a lot of budget smoke and mirrors in the (administration\u2019s) Pentagon budget, which is not really a true, honest and accurate budget.  When you confront military experts \u2013 retired or active \u2013 they concede these things to us.\u201d Republicans would compensate for higher defense spending in part by requiring greater federal worker pension contributions and more means-testing of entitlement benefits. Overall, Ryan\u2019s plan caps 2013 domestic discretionary spending \u2013 programs other than entitlements such as Social Security and Medicare \u2013 at $1.028 trillion.  Democrats immediately cried foul when the new proposed cap was unveiled, noting that it\u2019s nearly $20 billion below the total agreed to in last summer\u2019s deficit reduction deal. House GOP leaders insist they can propose any amount under the $1.047 trillion level, because that figure simply represents the top limit for discretionary spending, not a level up to which Congress must spend. While the House Republicans\u2019 proposed budget has no chance of becoming law, it could have a significant impact on this year\u2019s presidential and congressional campaigns. Democrats believe the proposed Medicare changes in particular could damage GOP hopes in key swing states such as Florida, which has a large elderly population. Numerous Republicans, however, believe they\u2019ll be rewarded for having the political courage to tackle politically sensitive issues. They also argue that it\u2019s important to draw clear distinctions with Democrats before voters go to the polls in November. CNN\u2019s Deirdre Walsh contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "NEW: A Romney spokesperson says Obama was not ready to be president Vice President Biden criticizes Republican presidential contenders by name \"They will bankrupt the middle class,\" Biden tells autoworkers in Ohio The Ohio stop is the first of four campaign speeches planned by the vice president Vice President Joe Biden on Thursday assumed the role of top campaign surrogate for President Barack Obama, harshly criticizing the economic policies of Republican presidential contenders Mitt Romney, Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum as a threat to the American middle class. \u201cIf you give any one of these guys the keys to the White House, they will bankrupt the middle class once again,\u201d Biden told autoworkers in Ohio, a key battleground state for Obama\u2019s re-election bid in November. The speech at a United Auto Workers hall in Toledo was the first of four planned in coming weeks by the vice president. It came hours before the Thursday night release of a 17-minute documentary that frames the narrative of the Obama presidency. With the Republican race remaining competitive among Romney, Santorum, Gingrich and trailing candidate Rep. Ron Paul of Texas, Biden kicked off the most visible effort to date of the Obama campaign to win a second term in the November general election. The vice president went after the Republican candidates by name, something the president has not done so far, and focused on the revival of the auto industry during the Obama administration to characterize GOP policies as misguided and out of touch. Team Obama ramps up campaign What will it take for Romney to win? Rick Santorum stands by English comment \u201cThese guys have a fundamentally different economic philosophy,\u201d Biden said of Romney, Gingrich and Santorum. \u201cWe\u2019re about promoting the private sector. They\u2019re about protecting the privileged sector.\u201d In particular, Biden cited the billions of dollars in government financial support for U.S. automakers during the recession as an example of the differing approaches between the parties. The program, which began in the Bush administration and was extended under Obama, provided money that kept General Motors and Chrysler operating and led to restructuring through bankruptcy. Both automakers now report growth, and GM has recorded record profits. Many Republicans strongly opposed what they called government bailouts of the private sector, and Biden made sure the autoworkers knew that. He quoted the headline of a November 2008 op-ed in the New York Times by Romney, whom the White House considers the likely Republican nominee, that said \u201cLet Detroit go bankrupt.\u201d Biden also told the crowd, which booed the Romney references, that the former Massachusetts governor once said the Obama administration\u2019s handling of the issue would make General Motors \u201cthe living dead.\u201d In addition, Biden quoted Gingrich as having called the auto industry funding \u201ca mistake.\u201d According to Biden, Obama knew at the time the move would be heavily criticized, but the president \u201cdidn\u2019t flinch.\u201d \u201cThis is a man with steel in his spine,\u201d Biden said of Obama\u2019s decision to provide more government money. \u201cHe made the tough call and the verdict is in. President Obama was right, and they were dead wrong.\u201d Of Romney\u2019s prediction of living dead, Biden said: \u201cWe have now living proof: a million jobs saved, 200,000 jobs created.\u201d Romney\u2019s op-ed called for a managed bankruptcy of the automakers rather than giving them government money. \u201cWithout that bailout, Detroit will need to drastically restructure itself,\u201d Romney wrote in the op-ed. \u201cWith it, the automakers will stay the course \u2013 the suicidal course of declining market shares, insurmountable labor and retiree burdens, technology atrophy, product inferiority and never-ending job losses. Detroit needs a turnaround, not a check.\u201d Today, Romney argues that what eventually happened followed what he prescribed back then. Romney also has said the private sector would have stepped in to help the auto industry without the need for government financing, but Biden rejected that contention Thursday. \u201cWrong,\u201d Biden declared, adding that no one \u2013 not even Romney\u2019s former company, Bain Capital \u2013 was loaning money at the height of the recession. A spokeswoman of the Romney campaign noted that back in 2007, then-Sen. Biden said he didn\u2019t believe Obama was ready to be president. \u201cMore than four years later, it\u2019s clear that he (Biden) was right,\u201d said the statement by Romney spokeswoman Andrea Saul, which attacked Obama\u2019s record but included no direct response to Biden\u2019s criticism of Romney\u2019s economic policies. A senior Democratic official told CNN on Thursday that Biden will continue his campaign efforts in Florida, talking at senior centers about Medicare and proposed reforms by Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wisconsin. Along with Ohio, other states targeted by Biden will be Iowa, New Hampshire and parts of Virginia, with the focus on tax reform, boosting manufacturing, the auto industry and Medicare, the official said. According to two Democratic officials, the campaign rollout with Biden\u2019s speech and the video release was planned for now because Democrats thought a Republican presidential nominee would have been determined. The officials said the campaign was unable to wait until May or June to begin responding to Republican attacks. Meanwhile, the chairman of the Republican National Committee, Reince Priebus, responded to the Obama campaign push by saying the president\u2019s policies have failed and change is needed. \u201cA campaign speech and Hollywood movie from the Obama campaign won\u2019t change the fact that family budgets in Ohio and across the country are being stretched by everything from food prices to soaring prices at the pump,\u201d Priebus said in a statement sent by e-mail. \u201cVoters have a clear choice this November: continue down Barack Obama\u2019s path of broken promises and failed policies, or change direction with new leadership committed to reversing the Obama agenda that has Americans worse off than they were four years ago.\u201d CNN\u2019s Jessica Yellin contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "The payroll tax cut extension passed Congress last week The tax break is worth about $83 a month for someone making $50,000 a year The agreement also extended unemployment benefits It prevents a cut in payments for Medicare doctors President Barack Obama on Wednesday signed into law the agreement passed by Congress last week to extend the payroll tax cut and unemployment benefits while preventing a cut in payments to Medicare doctors. The signing, announced in a White House statement, resolves those issues for the rest of 2012, beyond the November election in which Obama will seek a second term. On Tuesday, Obama congratulated Congress for overcoming sharp partisan divisions that have stymied progress in the past year and challenged legislators to enact the rest of his administration\u2019s economic priorities. \u201cFor a typical middle-class family, (the payroll tax cut) is a big deal,\u201d Obama said. \u201cNow my message to Congress is don\u2019t stop here. Keep going. \u2026 This may be an election year, but the American people have no patience for gridlock (and) reflexive partisanship.\u201d Earlier Wednesday, the administration unveiled Obama\u2019s plan to overhaul the corporate tax code by reducing  the corporate tax rate to 28% from 35% and eliminating dozens of business tax breaks. In addition, Obama has outlined a number of other proposals also believed to have little or no chance of winning approval among Republicans on Capitol Hill, most notably the so-called \u201cBuffett Rule\u201d designed to ensure people with annual incomes of more than $1 million pay at least a 30% tax rate. The White House believes Republicans are more willing to make deals in the wake of a bruising fight over raising the debt limit last year, according to a senior administration official. Political analysts, however, note that even if Obama\u2019s proposals fail to pass Congress, the president can draw a clear distinction between himself and his Republican opponent in November. Some analysts have speculated Obama is also laying the groundwork for a possible reprise of Harry Truman\u2019s successful 1948 campaign against a so-called \u201cdo-nothing\u201d Congress. At the moment, however, Democrats are taking a victory lap for the extension of the payroll tax cut. The roughly $100 billion measure, a key part of Obama\u2019s economic recovery plan, has reduced how much 160 million American workers pay into Social Security on their first $110,100 in wages. Instead of paying 6.2% had it lapsed, they\u2019ll be paying 4.2%, a break worth about $83 a month for someone making $50,000 a year. The measure, which passed both the House of Representatives and the Senate last Friday, also extends unemployment benefits and avoids a Medicare fee cut for doctors for the rest of the year. Obama has promised to sign the bill into law when it hits his desk this week. The payroll tax issue proved problematic for Republicans, who were caught between competing goals of providing the tax cut and paying for it. GOP leaders this month acknowledged they angered voters by initially raising objections to the unpaid tax-cut extension.

            "article_content": "Obama celebrates payroll tax cut, urges Congress to pass other domestic initiatives Obama says he is prepared to move ahead with or without Congress The payroll tax cut extension passed Congress last week The tax break is worth about $83 a month for someone making $50,000 a year President Barack Obama on Wednesday signed into law the agreement passed by Congress last week to extend the payroll tax cut and unemployment benefits while preventing a cut in payments to Medicare doctors. The president declared he is prepared to move ahead with his domestic agenda whenever possible with or without congressional support \u2013 a message with clear political overtones in the current election season. \u201cFor a typical middle-class family, (the payroll tax cut) is a big deal,\u201d Obama said. \u201cNow my message to Congress is don\u2019t stop here. Keep going. \u2026 This may be an election year, but the American people have no patience for gridlock (and) reflexive partisanship.\u201d In addition, Obama has outlined a number of other proposals also believed to have little or no chance of winning approval among Republicans on Capitol Hill, most notably the so-called \u201cBuffett Rule\u201d designed to ensure people with annual incomes of more than $1 million pay at least a 30% tax rate. \u201cWherever we have an opportunity, we\u2019re going to take steps on our own,\u201d the president said.  \u201cWe\u2019ve got a choice right now.  We can either settle for a country where a few people are doing very well and everybody else is having to just struggle to get by, or we can build an economy where everybody gets a fair shot and everybody\u2019s doing their fair share and everybody is taking responsibility.\u201d The White House believes Republicans are more willing to make deals in the wake of a bruising fight over raising the debt limit last year, according to a senior administration official. Political analysts, however, note that even if Obama\u2019s proposals fail to pass Congress, the president can draw a clear distinction between himself and his Republican opponent in November. Some analysts have speculated Obama is also laying the groundwork for a possible reprise of Harry Truman\u2019s successful 1948 campaign against a so-called \u201cdo-nothing\u201d Congress. At the moment, however, Democrats are taking a victory lap for the extension of the payroll tax cut. The roughly $100 billion measure, a key part of Obama\u2019s economic recovery plan, has reduced how much 160 million American workers pay into Social Security on their first $110,100 in wages. Instead of paying 6.2% had it lapsed, they\u2019ll be paying 4.2%, a break worth about $83 a month for someone making $50,000 a year. The measure, which passed both the House of Representatives and the Senate last Friday, also extends unemployment benefits and avoids a Medicare fee cut for doctors for the rest of the year. Obama has promised to sign the bill into law when it hits his desk this week. The payroll tax issue proved problematic for Republicans, who were caught between competing goals of providing the tax cut and paying for it. GOP leaders this month acknowledged they angered voters by initially raising objections to the unpaid tax-cut extension.",

            "article_content": "NEW: Some Republican congressmen question the tentative agreement Progress is made after Republicans back down on payroll tax cut Political analyst Norm Ornstein warns new GOP strategy could backfire President Obama warns that failing to act could hurt the economic recovery Congressional negotiators reached a tentative deal Tuesday to extend the payroll tax cut and unemployment benefits while avoiding a fee cut for Medicare doctors, according to Republican legislators and aides. The framework deal followed a key Republican concession Monday and could receive the endorsement of a House-Senate conference committee on Wednesday. Reps. Renee Ellmers of North Carolina and Fred Upton of Michigan, both Republicans who were part of the conference committee negotiations, called it a tentative agreement, while a top House Democratic aide said Democratic leaders would discuss the proposal with their members on Wednesday morning. Ellmers and Upton said they expected the conference committee to sign off on the measure Wednesday if no objections arise. In that case, the House would vote on the agreement, in the form of the conference committee report, as soon as Friday. However, some conservative House Republicans expressed concerns about the potential agreement and said they were unsure if they would support it. Other GOP House legislators said they expected it to pass with support from a majority of Republicans, as well as Democrats. \u201cIt\u2019s the art of a deal. I mean, it\u2019s a compromise,\u201d said Rep. Steve Latourette, R-Ohio. \u201cSo you have people that didn\u2019t get a 100% of what they wanted.\u201d Under the agreement that would cover the rest of 2012, the nearly $100 billion payroll tax cut would not be paid for \u2013 a consequence of the parties\u2019 inability to compromise on either new taxes or offsetting spending cuts, said top congressional aides from both parties. It would be coupled, however, with measures extending unemployment benefits and preventing a fee cut to Medicare doctors \u2013 known in Washington as the \u201cdoc fix.\u201d  The latter two measures \u2013 costing a combined $50 billion \u2013 would be paid for, the aides said. Possible funding sources to pay for the measure include saving from broadband spectrum sales of about $13 billion, increased pension contributions by federal employees of about $16 billion and cuts to Medicare hospital and specialist fees that would not impact patients, according to the congressional aides. \u201cI think they have to work out all the details, but I think the big scope has been agreed to,\u201d House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, told reporters. However, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Virginia, was less enthusiastic, saying \u201cthis is not our preferred way\u201d to deal with the issues and adding that details were still being studied. Congressional aides differed by party on details of extending the unemployment benefits, particularly the maximum number of weeks that will be funded. While a Democratic aide said the maximum for states with high unemployment would continue at the current 99 weeks, a Republican aide said the maximum would be 89 weeks and most states would have a maximum of 63 weeks of benefits by the end of the year. Some Republicans wanted unemployed individuals to pass drug tests and meet certain education standards before getting benefits \u2013 an idea generally opposed by Democrats. A top Republican aide said the tentative agreement would allow for states to conduct drug testing when the unemployment benefits applicant was seeking a job that required drug testing or lost a job due to a failed drug test. News of the tentative deal came hours after President Barack Obama publicly urged Congress to extend the payroll tax cut, which is currently set to expire at the end of February.  Failure to do so, Obama warned, could derail the economic recovery. \u201cThis is a make-or-break moment for the middle class,\u201d the president said.  \u201cThe last thing we need is for Washington to stand in the way of America\u2019s comeback.\u201d White House Press Secretary Jay Carney later told reporters that the payroll tax cut, extension of unemployment benefits and \u201cdoc fix\u201d provision all were \u201cimportant to the economy in different ways.\u201d \u201cIt is of vital importance that Congress not muck up the recovery that we\u2019re seeing under way,\u201d Carney said of the need for a broad agreement. The payroll tax cut, unemployment benefits and enhanced \u201cdoc fix\u201d payments are set to expire at the end of February under a short-term agreement reached by Congress in December. That agreement also set up the conference committee that resumed negotiations last month on a longer-term deal. Final negotiations have been hammered out by the two committee chairman, Democratic Sen. Max Baucus of Montana and Republican Rep. Dave Camp of Michigan, in conjunction with Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, and Boehner. The payroll tax cut, a key part of Obama\u2019s economic recovery plan, has reduced how much 160 million American workers pay into Social Security on their first $110,100 in wages. Instead of paying in 6.2%, they\u2019ve been paying 4.2% for the past year and two months. The break is worth about $83 a month for someone making $50,000. On Monday, House GOP leaders dropped their demand that any extension of the tax cut be offset by spending cuts elsewhere in the budget.  The decision was a sharp turnaround for House Republicans, who previously argued that a failure to fully pay for the tax break would be financially reckless. The debate over whether and how to extend the tax cut has been a political loser so far for the Republicans, who had publicly questioned its value last year.  Democrats have gleefully highlighted the GOP\u2019s reluctance, using the issue to portray Republicans as defenders of the rich who are indifferent to the plight of the middle class. Political analysts believe the showdown over the payroll holiday has eroded GOP strength on the party\u2019s core issue of lower taxes. Fearing negative repercussions, Republican leaders have now backtracked on the issue twice: dropping their opposition to the two-month extension last December and dropping their insistence on paying for a longer extension on Monday. \u201cI think the GOP has read the writing on the wall when it comes to the payroll tax cut,\u201d said Brown University political scientist Wendy Schiller.  \u201cAmericans are benefiting from it, and to take it away at this juncture leaves them open to charges of raising taxes. \u2026 It would severely hamper the GOP presidential nominee\u2019s effort to defeat Obama.\u201d Johns Hopkins University political scientist Adam Sheingate called the GOP\u2019s latest move \u201ca subtle shift in strategy precipitated by the improving economic outlook of the past few weeks.\u201d \u201cBy agreeing to a deal, the GOP can claim some credit for extending the holiday,\u201d Sheingate said.  \u201cFailing to extend the payroll tax would not only be unpopular, it would shift some of the responsibility for the economy back on the Republicans.  This is to be avoided at all costs since the GOP (election) strategy rests almost entirely on Obama\u2019s handling of the economy.\u201d In announcing their shift on the payroll tax issue Monday, Boehner and two other top House GOP leaders said they wanted separate the matter from legislation dealing with unemployment benefits and the doc fix. Doing so would \u201cprotect small businesses and our economy from the consequences of Washington Democrats\u2019 political games,\u201d said Boehner, Cantor and House Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy, R-California. Schiller told CNN the idea of divorcing the payroll tax cut from an unemployment benefits extension and the doc fix was a \u201cclever\u201d idea on the part of the  House GOP leadership. Doing so would have removed the Democrats\u2019 \u201cleverage on the other issues of unemployment and Medicare payments,\u201d she said.  \u201cAlso, as the unemployment numbers get better, the rationale for a lengthy extension of benefits diminishes.  The longer the GOP can stall on the unemployment extension, the more likely it is they win in terms of authorizing a much shorter extension than the Democrats would like.\u201d Democrats, however, quickly pushed back hard against the idea. Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-California, on Tuesday urged Republicans to allow Congress to quickly complete its work on all three issues \u2013 the payroll tax cut, unemployment insurance, and the doc fix. Pelosi said Congress should cancel a recess currently scheduled for next week if it fails to complete work on all of them by Friday. \u201cThese crucial policies affect millions of middle class families and seniors and must not expire at the end of this month,\u201d Pelosi said. Instead of a separate measure involving only the payroll tax cut extension, the tentative agreement Tuesday was a more comprehensive package worked out by the conference committee negotiators It remains unclear if the increasingly conservative House GOP caucus will be willing to go along with the tentative deal. House Republican freshmen, elected on a tidal wave of tea party support in 2010, have made deficit reduction their top priority and repeatedly insisted that any new initiatives be fully paid for. Rep. Dennis Ross, R-Florida, said discussion Tuesday night in the House Republican caucus was \u201cheated\u201d over not paying for the payroll tax cut extension, which he called \u201cbad policy,\u201d while fellow Floridian Rep. Allen West, a tea party conservative, said \u201cthis doesn\u2019t look like a good deal to me.\u201d Meanwhile, two New York Republicans,  Reps. Tom Reed and Peter King, sounded more supportive, with King saying he expected the measure to pass. One key conservative, Rep. Jim Jordan of Ohio, indicated Tuesday he\u2019s prepared to back Boehner and the other House GOP leaders. Jordan\u2019s \u201cview is anytime we\u2019re letting people keep more of their money, that\u2019s a good thing,\u201d said Brian Straessle, a spokesman for the Republican congressman. Veteran political analyst Norm Ornstein warned that the GOP leadership\u2019s repeated maneuvering on the issue could end up backfiring. House Republican leaders have been \u201ctrying to make the best of crummy situation,\u201d Ornstein told CNN.  But tea party Republicans \u201cdon\u2019t care\u201d if fighting the tax cut extension is \u201ca political loser.  They don\u2019t like the payroll tax cut and now the (leadership\u2019s) sin is being compounded by saying they won\u2019t pay for it.\u201d This \u201ccould play out in ways that make the life of Boehner (and other Republican leaders) a little less comfortable,\u201d he predicted.

            "article_content": "NEW: Obama calls passage of the package \"a big deal\" Senate and House pass payroll tax cut deal The compromise raises the deficit by $89 billion over 10 years, the CBO says The deal extends payroll tax cut, unemployment benefits, and \"doc fix\" The Senate and the House of Representatives passed a bipartisan deal Friday extending the payroll tax cut and unemployment benefits while also avoiding a Medicare fee cut for doctors for the rest of the year. The bill cleared the Senate in a 60-36 vote less than an hour after the House approved it by a 293-132 margin. A majority of House Republicans and Democrats voted in favor of the bill, though 91 Republicans and 41 Democrats in the chamber voted no.  Senate Democrats voted overwhelmingly for the bill while Senate Republicans largely opposed it. President Barack Obama has promised to sign the legislation as soon as he ends his current trip to the West Coast, ending debate on the politically sensitive measures at least for the duration of the election. \u201cThis is a big deal,\u201d the president told an audience in Washington state.  \u201cIt is amazing what happens when Congress focuses on doing the right thing instead of just playing politics.\u201d The roughly $100 billion payroll tax cut, a key part of Obama\u2019s economic recovery plan, has reduced how much 160 million American workers pay into Social Security on their first $110,100 in wages.  Instead of paying in 6.2%, they\u2019ve been paying 4.2% for the past year and two months \u2013 a break worth about $83 a month for someone making $50,000 a year. Without congressional action, all three measures would expire at the end of February. Payroll tax cut explained Congress reaches payroll tax deal Pay roll tax cuts \u2013 what\u2019s at stake \u201cOur founding fathers recognized that Washington would not always be united,\u201d said Rep. Dave Camp of Michigan, a top Republican involved in crafting the deal.  \u201cIn their wisdom they knew that even divided government must still govern. And that is what we are doing here today \u2013 governing and providing a solution to the very real problems Americans are facing in their daily lives.\u201d \u201cToday is a good day,\u201d declared House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, D-California. \u201cThis represents a victory for the middle class in our country.\u201d House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, on Thursday called the deal \u201ca fair agreement and one that I support.\u201d The agreement came together this week after House Republicans dropped a key demand Monday, saying they would accept the extended payroll tax cut without spending cuts elsewhere in the budget to cover the measure\u2019s roughly $100 billion cost. According to the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, the agreement would increase the federal deficit by $89 billion over 10 years, mostly through decreased tax revenue.  Numerous Republicans on Capitol Hill are vehemently opposed to any measure that increases the deficit.  They are also concerned about diverting more revenue away from Social Security, and believe the unemployment insurance extension will discourage people from seeking work. Boehner defended the decision to move forward with an unpaid extension, a move previously opposed by Republican leaders, by arguing it was the only way to prevent a tax hike demanded by Democrats to help pay the cost. \u201cWe were not going to allow Democrats to continue to play games and cause a tax increase for hardworking Americans,\u201d Boehner told reporters Wednesday.  \u201cWe made a decision to bring them to the table so that the games would stop and we would get this worked out.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s the art of a deal. I mean, it\u2019s a compromise,\u201d Rep. Steve Latourette, R-Ohio, said earlier in the week.  \u201cYou have people that didn\u2019t get \u2026 100% of what they wanted.\u201d The other two measures in the package \u2013 the unemployment benefits extension and the so-called doc fix \u2013 are estimated to cost a combined $50 billion. Unlike the tax cut, however, they will be paid for. Funding sources to pay for the benefits extension and the doc fix include savings from broadband spectrum sales, increased pension contributions by new federal employees, and cuts to Medicare hospital and specialist fees that will not affect patients, according to the House Ways and Means Committee. Several Democrats from Maryland and Virginia \u2013 near Washington \u2013 voted against the package because, they argued, it treats federal employees unfairly by requiring new government hires to contribute more to their pension. Under the terms of the deal, in states with unemployment rates higher than the national average of 8.3%, the maximum time an unemployed person can receive benefits will drop from 99 to 73 weeks. The maximum length of benefits for people in states with an average unemployment rate or lower will drop to 63 weeks or as far down as 40 weeks. The jobless have been able to collect up to 99 weeks of benefits since November 2009 as part of the nation\u2019s unprecedented response to the recession. In addition, states will be allowed to perform drug tests on individuals applying for unemployment benefits if those people lost their previous job because they either failed or refused an employer\u2019s drug test. Individuals receiving unemployment assistance could also be tested if they are seeking a job that generally requires a drug test. Also, welfare beneficiaries will be banned from accessing public assistance funds at ATMs in strip clubs, liquor stores, and casinos. The current February expiration date for the payroll tax cut, the additional unemployment benefits and the doc fix were put in place by a short-term agreement reached by Congress in December. That agreement also set up the conference committee that resumed negotiations last month on a longer-term deal. The debate over whether and how to extend the tax cut has been a political loser so far for the Republicans. Democrats have gleefully highlighted the GOP\u2019s reluctance to hold down the payroll tax rate, using the issue to portray Republicans as defenders of the rich who are indifferent to the plight of the middle class. A number of conservatives have questioned the economic value of the tax reduction. Political analysts believe the showdown over the payroll holiday has eroded GOP strength on the party\u2019s core issue of lower taxes. Fearing negative repercussions, Republican leaders have now backtracked on the issue twice: dropping their opposition to the two-month extension last December and dropping their insistence on paying for a longer extension on Monday.

He arrived to a decidedly different climate rife with political battles, overseas crises and continued economic uncertainty. The president and his family landed at Andrews Air Force Base just before 7 a.m. ET. Temperatures in Washington are roughly 30 degrees colder than in the Aloha State, though the weather may be the least of the changes and challenges that Obama will face. The news all but guaranteed to dominate headlines the day of the first family\u2019s arrival back in Washington is the Republican race for the right to challenge the president. Iowa\u2019s first-in-the-nation caucuses will be held Tuesday, pitting candidates who have been taking shots at Obama and his policies for months. Romney: 'I'm here to collect' Three-way battle for lead in Iowa What's Iran's real plan? U.S. forces deterrent on Korea Peninsula Obama will make an electronic appearance in the state, wading into the campaign by participating in a video teleconference with his Iowa supporters around 8:15 p.m. Tuesday. For the next 10 months, the president will be both campaigning and governing. Yet few expect many of the president\u2019s initiatives to move smoothly through Congress, especially in the GOP-led House, as both parties angle to score political points during what promises to be a fiercely fought election year. The president has framed the coming months as likely to be full of action that would define the direction of the nation. Specifically, he has urged more action to stimulate the still-uneven economy. \u201cAs I\u2019ve said before, we are at a make-or-break moment for the middle class,\u201d Obama said in his last weekly address of 2011. \u201cAnd in many ways, the actions we take in the months ahead will help determine what kind of country we want to be, and what kind of world we want our children and grandchildren to grow up in.\u201d Some showdowns appear inevitable. They include a fresh battle in two months, and perhaps others to come, over whether to extend a payroll tax cut. Further down the road is the prospect of $1.2 trillion in automatic cuts over the next decade \u2013 including $600 billion from the Pentagon \u2013 if Obama and Congress can\u2019t agree on reducing the debt by that amount of money, through some combination of budget cuts and increased revenues. International challenges loom as well, including several featuring some of the United States\u2019 staunchest rivals. The recent death of North Korea\u2019s longtime leader Kim Jong Il has raised concerns about the stability and security of the Korean peninsula, where nearly 30,000 U.S. troops are stationed in South Korea, and worries remain about Pyongyang\u2019s nuclear arsenal. Syria remains plagued by violence, much of it perpetrated against citizens by state forces, according to opposition activists, human rights advocates and outside observers, including from the United Nations. Then, there is the matter of Iran. On Monday, Iranian forces test-fired at least two missiles into the Strait of Hormuz, according to the state-run Islamic Republic News Agency. This action came during military exercises in the area that Western diplomats have described as further evidence of Tehran\u2019s volatile behavior.

By Moni Basu, CNN Baxley, Georgia (CNN) \u2013 Here in the home of timber yards, BB-gun champs and DEET-defying gnats, John Barrow is fighting for survival. He\u2019s the last standing white Democrat from the Deep South in the U.S. House of Representatives, a remaining sliver of a party machine that once brokered power for the region\u2019s establishment. John Barrow, the last white Democratic congressman from the Deep South, is fighting to win in a conservative district. Barrow\u2019s political death, if it comes on Election Day, would serve as a stark signal of the electoral realignment dividing Southern Democrats and Republicans along racial lines. The ramifications are huge \u2013 not just in the South, but nationally \u2013 in determining the future of both parties, say political observers and historians who are closely watching Barrow\u2019s uphill battle. If Barrow loses, every Democratic congressman from Louisiana, Mississippi, Alabama, South Carolina and Georgia will be black. Every Republican will be white, save Rep. Tim Scott of South Carolina, who was elected in 2010 with Tea Party backing. Barrow finds himself working hard for votes in Georgia towns swept by a tide of Republican Red \u2013 towns like Baxley, where, among many folks, saying \u201cDemocrat\u201d is like taking the devil\u2019s name. Barrow has attended the \u201cRedneck Games\u201d in Dublin and recently hosted a barbecue dinner at the American Legion Altamaha Post 26, where he bought five raffle tickets for a Mossberg Model 500A 12-gauge shotgun. He might belong to the party of his daddy and his granddaddy, but his public persona stands far removed from Washington\u2019s Democratic leadership. \u201cA Democratic label is a killer in that district,\u201d says Emory University political scientist Merle Black, an authority on Southern politics. \u201cThe Democratic Party across the Deep South is in real trouble with white voters.\u201d To make matters tougher, the GOP-controlled Georgia legislature redrew the boundaries for Barrow\u2019s 12th District following the 2010 census, making his constituency even redder. Barrow knows he can\u2019t win without a chunk of conservative Republicans crossing over. But those who have followed his career say if anyone can defy political odds, it\u2019s Barrow. \u201cThis is a district that went for (John) McCain and it will go for Mitt Romney this fall,\u201d Black says. Theoretically, it should be virtually impossible for Barrow to win a fifth term. But he\u2019s done it before. He\u2019s known as a survivor. And he acts like one on the campaign trail. \u2018Made in Georgia\u2019 On a muggy October morning, Barrow is on the second leg of his \u201cMade in Georgia\u201d tour. He\u2019s determined to get to know manufacturing companies in Appling and Coffee counties. They are new additions to a district that sprawls north along the Savannah River to Augusta and westward into towns like Vidalia, as in sweet onion fame, and Dublin, home to a VA hospital and plenty of shamrocks. The territory feels familiar \u2013 same land, people and values that dominate counties that were already in Barrow\u2019s district. But many here don\u2019t know his name, except maybe through the barrage of television commercials. \u201cI don\u2019t know if you know about my politics,\u201d Barrow tells Jimmy Cook, owner of a Baxley nursery that grows everything from peppers to poinsettias. \u201cActually, I\u2019m an independent,\u201d Barrow says. \u201cIf Obama is doing what\u2019s right for Georgia, then I\u2019m on his side. If he\u2019s not, then I\u2019m not.\u201d Down the road, folks like Stephen Worthington, director of Southeast wood procurement at lumber giant Rayonier, are fans of Rep. Jack Kingston, the Republican who represented these counties until redistricting. Worthington talks timber with Barrow, giving him a hard-hat-and-safety-glasses tour past menacing machinery that makes 1,200-pound pine logs look as light as toothpicks. \u201cWe need your help getting the housing economy back up,\u201d Worthington says. Later, after Barrow leaves, Worthington ponders the chances of a Barrow victory. \u201cIs anyone a Democrat around here?\u201d he says, looking around a room full of Republicans. Barrow knows well that he\u2019s facing the challenge of a lifetime around these parts. He\u2019s counting on making personal connections that will help him bridge the political gap. Like with Philip Smith, the manager of aluminum maker Elixir Industries in nearby Douglas. In a chat in his office, Smith tells Barrow two things right off the bat: that he pretty much votes Republican, and that Barrow\u2019s GOP challenger, Lee Anderson, is also getting a tour of Elixir today. Not one to show a great deal of emotion, Barrow nods his head and lets Smith continue. \u201cHere\u2019s what people around here don\u2019t like about Washington,\u201d Smith says. \u201cPeople are tired of bickering between Republicans and Democrats.\u201d Barrow leans forward in his armchair. \u201cI\u2019m a party unfavorite,\u201d he tells Smith. \u201cI am one of the most independent people up there. \u201cYou should never surrender your own good judgment to someone else.\u201d A politician\u2019s true measure of independence, Barrow believes, is how often he disagrees with his own side and votes with the other. On that scale, Barrow\u2019s a clear voice down the middle, he tells Smith. That\u2019s exactly how a television ad portrays Barrow to prospective voters. \u201cHi, I\u2019m John Barrow. Some people like me. Some people don\u2019t,\u201d starts the ad. He says the Democrats don\u2019t like his \u201cA\u201d rating with the NRA, which endorsed him in the race. Republicans, he says, don\u2019t like that he voted against the plan to privatize Medicare. He says both parties were wrong on the Wall Street bailout. \u201cI approved this message because folks in Washington don\u2019t like me being independent, but you\u2019re the one who counts.\u201d It\u2019s that kind of courting of conservatives that wins Barrow points. He makes headway with Smith. The plant manager tells Barrow he is tired of young people who ought to be working taking advantage of entitlements. He\u2019s had enough of the country\u2019s massive deficit. \u201cYou can\u2019t spend more than you earn,\u201d Smith says. \u201cThat\u2019s right,\u201d Barrow says, telling him how he has been working with the fiscally conservative Blue Dog Coalition in Congress to reduce the deficit. It\u2019s apparent that it will take a lot for Smith to cast a ballot for a Democrat. But Barrow, it seems, has gotten his ear. John Barrow greets aluminum plant employees in Douglas, Georgia, a town that was added to his district when the GOP-dominated legislature redrew the lines. Kith and kin Smith takes him on an exhaustive tour of Elixir\u2019s vast plant, which spits out shiny new aluminum products in seemingly every shape and size known to man. The workers here make shower doors, side rails for golf carts, even field-hockey posts. Barrow says hello to many of the employees on their 11:30 a.m. lunch break, greeting them with a fist-bump and flashing a toothy smile. In one of the small break rooms, he sits down to eat a Subway Italian foot-long he\u2019s brought along for his tour. Most of the employees have brought food from home: sandwiches, chicken and rice. Barrow talks a language lawmaker and worker have in common: football. The Coffee County high school team just beat Tifton 24-7. They play Lowndes County later in the month. Barrow asks if the Valdosta school is still a formidable foe. \u201cNah,\u201d the employees respond in unison. \u201cThey ain\u2019t no good no more,\u201d adds one. With others, he talks land. His grandma was born in Baxley. Lived here in the 1880s when white folks in Dixie were fiercely proud to be Democrats. He grew up in Athens, the son of Judge James Barrow and Phyllis Jenkins Barrow, who both served in the military during World War II. When he was \u201citty-bitty,\u201d Barrow says, he drove through Appling County on his way to Jekyll Island for family vacations on the Georgia coast. That was at the height of the struggle to end segregation. He studied political science and history at the University of Georgia \u2013 his blood runs Bulldog Red and Black \u2013 before studying law at Harvard. By then, the South had already turned the corner in going from blue to red. After President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the 1964 Civil Rights Act into law, he reportedly told an aide: \u201cWe have lost the South for a generation.\u201d Johnson was right. Conservative white Southerners turned Republican in droves as the national Democratic Party championed equal rights and was seen as increasingly liberal. That perception remains an obstacle for Barrow to this day. \u201cThe Democratic Party is now defined by Barack Obama, Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid. These are very liberal Democrats,\u201d says Emory\u2019s Black. \u201cAnd that\u2019s a nonstarter for a majority of whites in the South.\u201d As Barrow makes his way past machines that melt and mold aluminum, Mark Sibley comes running out of a glass office. He wants to shake Barrow\u2019s hand. \u201cI vote for anybody who\u2019s good. I don\u2019t care about party,\u201d Sibley says. He tells Barrow he likes his commercials and his promises to end wasteful spending. Mark Sibley ran out to shake Barrow\u2019s hand during a tour of Elixir Industries. Sibley has worked at Elixir for 2 1/2 years. That was after he lost a job at a chicken plant that shuttered its Coffee County operations in 2009. Sibley says it means a lot to him that Barrow came to visit Elixir and took the time to meet with voters. He and others here say they aren\u2019t much impressed with Barrow\u2019s opponent. Lee Anderson, a state legislator and former head of the Georgia Farm Bureau, stamps his campaign placards with an image of a tractor. He has a Southern accent so pronounced, says Atlanta Journal-Constitution columnist Jim Galloway, that it ought to be bottled up for posterity. Anderson has played up his rural Georgia roots. But some people around here don\u2019t think much of his farming background. \u201cHe ain\u2019t never cut anything but hay,\u201d Anderson\u2019s critics like to say. A weak opponent could save the day for Barrow, and so far Anderson has not shown to be otherwise, Emory\u2019s Black says.\u00a0The Rothenberg Report, a nonpartisan political handicapper, is now characterizing the 12th District race as \u201ctoss-up/tilt Democrat.\u201d \u201cThis district is one that should have never been a headache for the GOP, but after getting a weak nominee in state Rep. Lee Anderson, reality is setting in for many Republican operatives,\u201d Rothenberg said. \u201cAnderson\u2019s weakness isn\u2019t the only factor in this race. Rep. John Barrow has run a good race with terrific TV ads meant to demonstrate his political independence and get voters to focus on him and not on his party.\u201d The report cited Barrow for distancing himself from the \u201cthe stereotypical Democratic label.\u201d Anderson has refused to debate Barrow, demanding that he pronounce his presidential choice in front of a camera so as to not deceive voters. \u201cI want him to tell the truth,\u201d Anderson says. \u201cSometimes he\u2019s an independent. Sometimes he\u2019s a Democrat. Sometimes, who knows?\u201d Barrow says he has already said he will vote for Obama and that Anderson just doesn\u2019t want to talk about the issues. Bob Young, a well-known Georgia Republican who served as mayor of Augusta in the early 2000s, says Anderson is making a mistake by not confronting Barrow in a public face-off. \u201cFrom my perspective, I want to see my Republican candidate take on the opposition head to head, toe to toe, here in the district,\u201d Young says. \u201cThis campaign is not being waged in front of the people,\u201d Young says. \u201cAt the end of the day, I\u2019m a Republican. But (Anderson) makes it hard.\u201d It\u2019s not as hard for Young\u2019s wife, Gwen Fulcher Young, who made up her mind not just to vote for Barrow but actively solicit votes for him. \u201cMy wife has gone rogue,\u201d Young jokes. But he adds that he can see the attraction to Barrow. \u201cHe has built a reputation for constituent service,\u201d Young says. \u201cPeople relate to a congressman who relates to them. Barrow\u2019s a known quantity.\u201d The presidential vote could also affect the outcome of Barrow\u2019s race, says Galloway. \u201cIn Georgia, Mitt Romney was the second choice for many Republican voters,\u201d Galloway says. \u201cThere are some indications of a lack of enthusiasm. And that means a disenchanted (GOP) turnout.\u201d Barrow looks at it differently: the more voters, the better. \u201cPresidential turnout is always the best no matter who\u2019s on the ballot,\u201d he says. It\u2019s like every church that has members who show up only one time of the year, he says. On Easter Sunday. Black and white Barrow\u2019s campaign sent out more than 500 invitations for an early evening dinner at a rented event space in Douglas called The Atrium. It\u2019s a building that was recently rehabbed by developer Francis Lott, who hung up his Democratic credentials for the GOP about 15 years ago. About 30 people show up for pulled pork barbecue and green beans just as dark clouds begin to scatter in the sky. Many are African-Americans who make up Barrow\u2019s core support in rural Georgia. John Barrow shares a meal with supporters in Douglas, Georgia. Some black voters perceived Barrow as distancing himself from the Democratic party to win votes. They don\u2019t care much for the fact that Barrow voted against the president\u2019s Affordable Care Act, otherwise known as Obamacare. Or that he voted to hold Attorney General Eric Holder in contempt of Congress for refusing to comply with congressional subpoenas related to the deadly Operation Fast and Furious scandal. They don\u2019t think Barrow ought to be distancing himself from the president the way they thought he did by not attending the Democratic National Convention. If you\u2019re going to be a Democrat, then be a Democrat, says Johnny Roper, who served on the Douglas city commission for 27 years. \u201cWe really want someone more devoted,\u201d he says as caterers begin to serve the meal. But, he asks, what\u2019s the choice? There\u2019s a big difference between Barrow and his Republican opponent, who Roper says is \u201cno good for poor folks.\u201d But minority votes like Roper\u2019s have been diluted in Barrow\u2019s newly drawn district. The Georgia General Assembly had redrawn Barrow\u2019s district once before. Barrow was first elected to Congress in 2004, the same year Republicans took control of both houses in the state legislature for the first time since Reconstruction. Two years later, Barrow\u2019s hometown of Athens was cut from his district in an unprecedented mid-decade redistricting, and the congressman moved to Savannah. He had to move again to Augusta when his district lost Chatham County, which includes a chunk of core Democratic voters in Savannah, and gained large swaths of rural areas populated by conservative whites. Georgia Republicans say the lines were redrawn to reflect the state\u2019s population changes. But civil rights groups say Republicans are trying to further empower themselves by isolating black voters in majority-minority districts represented mostly by black Democrats. \u201cThey are using race,\u201d says Anita Earls, a civil rights lawyer and executive director of the Southern Coalition for Social Justice. \u201cThe Republican strategy is to try to make the Democratic Party a party of black people,\u201d she says. That will make it more difficult for Democrats to win races in the near future, Earls says, but changing U.S. demographics \u2013 in which minority populations are growing at faster rates than whites \u2013 means that eventually that strategy will be doomed. \u201cThey don\u2019t have a long-term formula for success,\u201d Earls says. \u201cMaybe, they get a decade.\u201d Emory\u2019s Black says the Republicans are doing what the Democrats did to them when they dominated the state assembly: drawing them out of power. U.S. House Speaker John Boehner said as much when he spoke to the Georgia delegation at the Republican convention in Tampa. There was only one Georgia Republican in the House when Boehner first entered Congress in 1991. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have 10 after November \u2013 two more,\u201d he said, according to the Atlanta Journal-Constitution. He was talking about Georgia\u2019s population gains that led to the creation of a new 14th District that\u2019s overwhelmingly GOP \u2013 and, of course, about Barrow. \u201cI can\u2019t speak to the motives of the people who drew the lines,\u201d says Young, the former Augusta mayor, \u201cbut we all know that the Supreme Court has set a pretty high bar in maintaining communities of interest. These districts have passed the muster of the Obama Justice Department.\u201d But Barrow says he feels like a target, a poster child, he says, for gerrymandering. \u201cNo question about it,\u201d he says \u2013 the Republicans are trying to force him out. \u201cBut I made a promise to my voters.\u201d It\u2019s a pledge he intends to honor \u2013 to represent the people who have looked to him in Congress since he was first elected. Lowell M. Greenbaum, chairman of the Democratic Party in Richmond County, says the idea that the Democratic Party can no longer attract Southern white voters is incorrect. Barrow agrees. \u201cLook, voters are up for grabs and parties have always responded one way or the other,\u201d he says. \u201cThe problem is that voters have had their votes taken away from them without them realizing it,\u201d he says, referring to the creation of minority-majority districts. Greenbaum doesn\u2019t begrudge Barrow\u2019s strategy of playing up his independence, playing it down the middle and not always advertising loudly that he still belongs to the party of his daddy and granddaddy. \u201cHe does cast a vote at times with which the Democratic Party is not happy,\u201d Greenbaum says. \u201cBut when we invite him to explain his votes, he always comes. He is in direct communication with us all the time, which we feel is very important for a congressman.\u201d Barrow has a way with people, Greenbaum says. And that\u2019s why a white Democratic congressman from the Deep South could still have an office in Washington after November.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Embed America is a partnership between CNN Radio and CNN iReport. This series tells the story of the 2012 U.S. presidential election through the people most critical to the campaigns: the voters. CNN Radio is traveling across the country to interview iReporters on election issues close to their hearts. These issues were named important by iReporters during phase 1 of the iReport Debate. Janet Copeland remarried says she's using life savings to pay for health insurance premiums Copeland and husband disagree about Affordable Care Act Conservatives say implementing health care law at state level could bankrupt the country Health care law supporters say this election \"is the most important in U.S. history\" Janet Copeland and her husband, Richard, both say they agree almost all the time, with one exception: The Affordable Care Act, President Barack Obama\u2019s health care legislation. \u201cWe\u2019re kind of split on that one,\u201d Janet says. \u201cIt\u2019s one of the few heated discussions we have. Right now, I\u2019m at the point where I\u2019ve already told (Richard) that \u2018OK, if the person you want gets elected, sit back and watch.\u2019 We\u2019re in a little standoff about that one. There\u2019s never blood drawn, but it gets interesting.\u201d Richard Copeland, a 62-year-old retired Army veteran, just rolls his eyes. \u201cI did not like the way it was shoved down our throats,\u201d Richard responds. \u201cWhat about the people that can\u2019t afford health insurance? What part of not being able to afford it doesn\u2019t our president understand? There are people out there working just to put bread on the table, and now he\u2019s saying \u2018I don\u2019t care if your family eats or not.\u2019 \u201c Richard\u2019s wife is having a hard time paying her health insurance. According to Families USA, a liberal-leaning health insurance advocacy group, Janet Copeland\u2019s situation is common. Families USA reported that before the passage of the ACA, some 2.3 million American families lost their health care each year because of price. The group believes the ACA will help families from being priced out of health insurance coverage. He says it\u2019s unfair to penalize his wife if she decides not to pay for coverage. He supports GOP candidate Mitt Romney. And Richard has health insurance through the Veterans Administration. But Janet, who is quickly using up her life savings to pay her monthly health premium, is fully supportive of Obamacare, and supports Democratic President Barack Obama in his re-election bid. But in ironic fashion, the reason this debate has come to the Copeland household is because the couple decided to get married. Watch behind the scenes interview with Janet Copeland After getting married, the couple moved into a ranch style home on the banks of Lake Conway, just north of Little Rock. But before they started a life together, Janet Copeland was married for almost 50 years. The Arkansas native married her ex-husband at age 15. Janet raised two children, maintained the house, and painted portraits and landscapes on the side. \u201cI held one job during my marriage, working as an art instructor,\u201d Janet says. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t for very long, and it wasn\u2019t for many hours per week.\u201d After a long, unhappy marriage, Janet got divorced in her mid-60s. During the separation, Janet learned she did not work enough during her life to qualify for Social Security or reduced cost Medicare. So, she negotiated with her ex-husband, and he agreed to give her a small lump sum of money, along with subsidizing her health care premiums. While she was single, Janet Copeland paid just over $200 per month. \u201cThen I got married, and the whole thing changed,\u201d Janet says. Now, she pays $703 per month. When she remarried, Janet\u2019s ex-husband no longer paid any part of her health premium. She couldn\u2019t qualify for Medicaid, the government\u2019s health care program for the poor, because she had to count Richard\u2019s retirement income of about $2000 per month. So, Janet had to turn to her life savings. \u201cWhat I do is I\u2019ve got it set up where I get $1,000 a month, it\u2019s like a trust, to pay my insurance and everything else,\u201d Janet says. \u201cIt won\u2019t last me for a lifetime, I think, but right now, my insurance is taken care of.\u201d Read Janet Copeland\u2019s original story on CNN iReport What\u2019s important about Janet Copeland\u2019s story, says Anthony Wright, is that it illustrates how routine life changes can dramatically change individual health care costs. Wright is the executive director of Health Access, a California-based nonpartisan, not-for-profit think tank. \u201cA family\u2019s health insurance rate can change for a variety of reasons, both a birth in the family, a death in the family, a divorce,\u201d says Wright. \u201cEven somebody just doing the very natural thing of reaching (their) birthday. One of the worst birthday presents you can receive is a rate increase from your health insurer.\u201d The presidential candidates each offer dramatically different policies on how to handle rate changes. In the most general terms, Wright says, Obama\u2019s signature health care law makes it harder to increase rates for routine life changes, while GOP candidate Mitt Romney wants to repeal that law entirely. \u201cWe\u2019ve always had candidates with different proposals, but we\u2019ve never had an election which would really determine whether a whole set of benefits and consumer protections were at stake, where the line was so clearly drawn,\u201d he adds. How have you been affected by the health care ruling? Share your story with CNN iReport. Wright says Janet Copeland could benefit from some of the provisions of the Affordable Health Care act, like the expansion of Medicaid. The health care program serves low income citizens, and is run jointly by the federal government and the states. Yet, it\u2019s unclear how those provisions will be applied in the Copeland\u2019s home state of Arkansas. Democratic Gov. Mike Beebe will ultimately have to approve any expansion of Medicaid and Medicare in his state. Those are the provisions most likely to help Janet Copeland lower her Medicare premiums. Yet, the Democratic governor has issued statements indicating he is still studying the law and the recent U.S. Supreme Court ruling. iReport Debate: Face-off on Supreme Court ruling Many Arkansas Republicans have taken the position of Gov. Rick Perry of Texas. The former GOP presidential candidate has long argued that Obamacare provisions, like expanding Medicaid, will bankrupt individual states. Perry, like Richard Copeland, also disagrees with the health care law on philosophical grounds. \u201cI will not be party to socializing health care and bankrupting my state in direct contradiction to our Constitution and our founding principles of limited government,\u201d Perry said in a statement shortly after the U.S. Supreme Court ruling. Now that the U.S. Supreme Court has ruled Obamacare is constitutional, Anthony Wright of Health Access says the outcome of this presidential election will determine whether the law is ultimately fully enforced. From a health care perspective, Wright says this election is \u201cthe most important\u201d in U.S. history. Yet, despite the potential importance this election may have on their day-to-day lives, Janet and Richard Copeland may decide, as a couple, simply not to vote. \u201cWe\u2019ll just end up canceling each other out,\u201d Janet says. \u201cBut if we do decide to skip the vote, at least we\u2019re doing it together. Life is better with someone you love.\u201d See all of the Embed America coverage here. And track the Embed team\u2019s progress on our map.",

            "article_content": "NEW: Obama says extending tax cuts for all but the wealthiest \"the best thing for the economy\" Like the speaker's office, the White House says \"lines of communication remain open\" Boehner says \"spending is the problem;\" Democrats say the rich should pay more Stocks fall amid uncertainty about the political impasse over the fiscal cliff Facing a looming deadline to avoid the fiscal cliff, President Barack Obama and House Speaker John Boehner met Thursday for their first face-to-face talk in four days. Boehner arrived for the previously unscheduled meeting just after 5 p.m. ET, a few hours after claiming Obama had failed to offer a serious compromise to prevent the fiscal cliff\u2019s automatic tax hikes and spending cuts set to take effect in less than three weeks. He spent about 50 minutes in the White House before returning to his office. A White House official and Boehner\u2019s spokesman then issued near identical statements, calling the Oval Office meeting \u201cfrank\u201d and saying the \u201clines of communication remain open.\u201d The meeting didn\u2019t spur Boehner to change his plans to return to Ohio on Friday, one of the speaker\u2019s aides said. The House is scheduled to end its current session that day, but Majority Leader Eric Cantor has told lawmakers they could be working longer than that with the fiscal cliff still in limbo. Cummings: We'll have some type of deal Seniors watch fiscal cliff budget talks Should fiscal deal include welfare cuts? Sachs: Everyone concerned what U.S. does The inability to reach a deal, thus far, reflects Democrats and Republicans\u2019 underlying divisions about the size of government and how much the wealthiest Americans should pay in taxes. For all the public posturing and private talks, there are fears failing to avert a crisis \u2013 which has been two years in the making \u2013 could spur another recession. The possibility is spooking holiday shoppers and investors, with stock values falling due to the fiscal uncertainty despite otherwise upbeat economic news. Boehner on Thursday said the president hasn\u2019t signed on to a plan that \u201cis truly balanced and begins to solve our spending problem.\u201d Republicans have said 71% of every tax dollar now goes to support Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid, as well as paying interest on the national debt, claiming the cost of these items would equal all federal tax revenue in 2026 unless changes are made. \u201cThe president wants to pretend spending isn\u2019t the problem,\u201d said Boehner. \u201cThat\u2019s why we don\u2019t have an agreement.\u201d One simple, controversial fiscal cliff fix Minutes before he spoke, House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi argued Obama and Congress already cut spending in budget battles of the past two years. Simply cutting more, she said, could hurt the economy. \u201cYou\u2019re not going to reduce the deficit by \u2026 only cutting your way to it because you will cut the prospects for job creation, which produce revenue,\u201d Pelosi said. At the White House, spokesman Jay Carney complained Republicans haven\u2019t offered details on which deductions or loopholes they would eliminate to raise revenue. Regardless, he reiterated Obama will only agree to a deal if it involves tax rates going up for the top 2% of Americans and extending tax cuts for all others \u2013 a proposal some Republicans have said they\u2019re open to, but not Boehner. \u201cThat\u2019s the best thing for the economy, the best thing for American families,\u201d Obama told CNN California affiliate KCRA of his plan. \u201cThat will take the edge off things. We\u2019ll still have to deal with some deficits and debt problems, but it means 98% of Americans, 97% of small businesses will not see their taxes go up.\u201d By the numbers: Fiscal cliff The two sides have exchanged counteroffers that include two shifts by the White House. Democratic sources said Obama lowered his revenue demand from $1.6 trillion to $1.4 trillion and also added changes to the corporate rate to his proposal involving income taxes. Obama and Democrats want Boehner to hold a vote on the president\u2019s tax plan to extend tax cuts for income up to $250,000 for families, which the Senate passed. Some House Republicans have said they\u2019d support the measure, which the Senate passed, and Boehner avoided a direct answer when asked Thursday about a possible vote. Boehner argues that raising taxes on high-income earners \u201cwill hurt small businesses.\u201d Some small business owners interviewed by CNNMoney said they\u2019d continue with plans to expand even if the Obama proposal gets passed and raises their taxes. They hate higher taxes, but say they\u2019ll endure it. And the Business Roundtable, an association of CEOs of major corporations, dropped its opposition to the Whit House plan on Wednesday. \u201cIf your business is good, you\u2019ll grow it. We\u2019ll figure out a way,\u201d said Chelsea Sloan, who started the Uptown Cheapskate retail franchise. \u201cBusiness owners who say they\u2019ll stop hiring if tax rates go higher are blowing smoke.\u201d Sen. Ron Johnson conceded Wednesday on Fox Business Network that Obama \u201cholds all the cards\u201d since he can veto any bill. \u201cSo we may have to do a fallback position where we\u2019re just trying to minimize the damage,\u201d the Wisconsin Republican said. At the same time, Johnson said Obama and fellow Democrats haven\u2019t shown they intend \u201cto limit the rate of growth in government.\u201d How people are prepping for the fiscal cliff Democrats consider entitlement programs to be the foundation of the social contract with Americans and therefore question pushes to cut them. Instead, they insist the programs can be strengthened through improved efficiency and other reforms, such as the $700 billion in Medicare savings under Obama\u2019s 2010 health care reform law. Is the tea party ready to deal on fiscal cliff? Polls consistently show the public favors Obama\u2019s position of raising taxes on wealthy Americans in order to minimize cuts. Nearly half of Americans \u2013 49% \u2013 approve the president\u2019s handling of the talks, compared with 25% who say Boehner is doing a good job, according to an ABC News/Washington Post poll released Wednesday. Meanwhile, a Bloomberg National Poll found nearly two-thirds of respondents, including nearly 50% of Republicans, believe Obama\u2019s re-election gave him a mandate to seek higher taxes on the wealthy. Businesses hate higher taxes but say they\u2019ll endure it Regardless of which side of the debate citizens fall, experts agree most everyone will be affected if a deal isn\u2019t struck. Two former Senate majority leaders said Thursday both sides must be ready to compromise. \u201cThe simplest way to put it is that we\u2019re at 24% spending, we\u2019re at 16% revenue,\u201d said Tom Daschle, the former Democratic senator from South Dakota. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to bring those two closer together, and that\u2019s how you get a balanced budget, and ultimately that\u2019s how you get fiscal responsibility. \u2026 It can be done.\u201d To Trent Lott, the former Republican senator from Mississippi, it comes down to the principal negotiators. \u201cThere\u2019ll come a moment when the speaker \u2026 and the president will have to make a decision,\u201d Lott said. \u201cBut they need to do it in concert.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s like directing the orchestra. You\u2019ve got to have the winds and the brass come together, and they\u2019re not quite there.\u201d How will the fiscal cliff affect you?

            "article_content": "President Obama and House Speaker Boehner meet at the White House Their spokesmen issue identical statements about the first such talks in 23 days Democrats and the GOP have been sparring about efforts to avert the fiscal cliff Sen. Corker joins some Republicans as open to hiking tax rates on the wealthy Twenty-three days since they last met face-to-face and 23 days before the fiscal cliff becomes a harsh reality, the two men most pivotal to the contentious budget talks sat down Sunday. There was no evidence of a breakthrough, though President Barack Obama and House Speaker John Boehner at least did agree on something: what, and what not, to say. Sunday\u2019s White House meeting caught some by surprise, considering it had not been on the president\u2019s official schedule and the two sides have been sparring publicly, accusing each other of failing to work sincerely toward a compromise. After the talks ended, White House spokesman Josh Earnest and Boehner spokesman Brendan Buck issued identical statements. \u201cThis afternoon, the president and Speaker Boehner met at the White House to discuss efforts to resolve the fiscal cliff. We\u2019re not reading out details of the conversation, but the lines of communication remain open.\u201d SNL rips Boehner-Obama relationship Lagarde: 'Zero' U.S. growth without deal Fiscal cliff and cost of doing nothing The statements didn\u2019t give much insight into developments on the effort to prevent the U.S. government from going over the fiscal cliff, the term referring to the widespread automatic tax hikes and spending cuts that will take effect in January without a deal. On Sunday, International Monetary Fund chief Christine Lagarde echoed numerous economic experts in predicting a sharp drop in confidence and \u201czero\u201d U.S. economic growth if there\u2019s no agreement. But the two political camps\u2019 matching words were remarkable, given what they have been saying about each for weeks. Last Friday, for instance, Boehner reported \u201cno progress\u201d and accused the White House of having \u201cwasted another week.\u201d \u201cThere are a lot of things that are possible to put the revenue that the president seeks on the table, but none of it\u2019s going to be possible if the president insists on his position, insists on \u2018my way or the highway,\u2019\u201d the Ohio Republican told reporters. Obama has held his ground, especially on his insistence that tax rates return to 1990s\u2019 levels for families with incomes higher than $250,000, while they\u2019d remain the same for those making less than that. Poll: Public OK with tax hike for wealthy The fiscal cliff and food safety What if we go off the fiscal cliff? After campaigning against any tax increases, many top Republicans have expressed willingness since the election to raise revenue by adjusting deductions and loopholes. But Boehner and others have said any revenue hikes must be packaged with major spending cuts, including reforms to entitlement programs such as Medicare and Medicaid. And they\u2019ve resisted any tax rate hikes \u2013 including for the wealthiest Americans \u2013 as part of any deal. There have been some public departures from that thinking however. On Sunday, Sen. Bob Corker of Tennessee said he\u2019d support raising taxes on the top 2% of households, arguing it will better position Republicans to negotiate for larger spending cuts to Social Security and Medicare despite opposition from many Democrats. \u201cA lot of people are putting forth a theory, and I actually think it has merit, where you go ahead and give the president \u2026 the rate increase on the top 2%, and all of a sudden the shift goes back to entitlements,\u201d Corker said on \u201cFox News Sunday.\u201d Corker is not entirely alone, as fellow Republican Sens. Tom Coburn, Susan Collins and Olympia Snowe have said they could vote for such a limited tax hike. There have been fewer higher-profile voices express that opinion in the House, though. One of them, Rep. Tom Cole of Oklahoma, reiterated Sunday that he could go along with this scenario. \u201cYou have to do something, and doing something requires the cooperation of the Senate, which the Democrats run, and the signature of the president,\u201d Cole said on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union.\u201d But one of his colleagues, Rep. Marsha Blackburn, said the Republicans shouldn\u2019t budge. Despite the loss of Republican seats in the House and Senate, Blackburn argued voters affirmed support for the GOP on Election Day and \u201cclearly said we don\u2019t want our taxes to go up.\u201d \u201cThe president thinks he has momentum, I think he is running on adrenaline from the campaign,\u201d the Tennessee lawmaker told CNN. This story was reported by Jessica Yellin, CNN\u2019s chief White House correspondent, in Washington and written by Greg Botelho in Atlanta.",

            "article_content": "NEW: Grover Norquist says lawmaker \"tried to weasel out\" of anti-tax pledge More Republicans call for increased tax revenue in a deficit deal President Obama and Congress are trying to work out an agreement Without a deal, the nation faces the so-called \"fiscal cliff\" come January Is it a slow leak that will grow into a cascade, or a minor drip easily plugged? More and more, conservative Republicans in Congress are breaking from a pledge they signed years earlier against any kind of tax increase or additional tax revenue. Facing the so-called fiscal cliff of automatic tax hikes and deep across-the-board spending cuts at the end of the year, the GOP legislators are signaling their willingness to cut a deal with President Barack Obama and Democrats that would include more money for the government. Poll: Lawmakers won\u2019t act their age on fiscal cliff The overall numbers remain relatively small \u2013 a handful of senators and House members \u2013 but they include influential veterans such as Sens. Saxby Chambliss of Georgia and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, along with Rep. Peter King of New York. Defining fiscal cliff progress Corker: Don't wait to fix fiscal cliff Complete explanation of 'fiscal cliff' Negotiators weigh in on fiscal cliff King has \u201ctried to weasel out\u201d of the pledge, anti-tax crusader Grover Norquist told CNN\u2019s Piers Morgan on Monday. \u201cI hope his wife understands commitments last a little longer than two years or something.\u201d Norquist said King knew when he signed it that he was pledging that \u201cas long as you\u2019re in Congress, you will rein in spending and reform government, not raise taxes. It\u2019s not for 500 years or two generations. It\u2019s only as long as you\u2019re in the House or the Senate. If he stayed too long, that\u2019s his problem.\u201d iReport: Share your financial compromise stories On Sunday,  Graham declared on ABC, \u201cWe don\u2019t generate enough revenue,\u201d officially disagreeing with the Taxpayer Protection Pledge he signed at Norquist\u2019s behest. Others who have rejected the strict dogma of the Norquist pledge include Sens. John McCain of Arizona, Tom Coburn of Oklahoma and Bob Corker of Tennessee, as well as Rep. Scott Rigell of Virginia, who was elected in the tea party wave of 2010 and recently re-elected. Norquist, who founded the conservative Americans for Tax Reform, advocates shrinking government by cutting spending instead of raising taxes through higher rates or reforms. He sounded unconcerned Monday about the GOP backlash, telling CNN that \u201cno pledge taker has voted for a tax increase.\u201d \u201cYou\u2019ve had some people discussing impure thoughts on national television,\u201d Norquist said. Norquist: I\u2019ll unseat pledge breakers At the White House, spokesman Jay Carney told reporters he hoped the \u201cwelcome\u201d comments by some Republicans represented \u201ca difference in tone and approach to these problems.\u201d To CNN Chief Political Analyst Gloria Borger, the softening tone by some in the GOP was explained by new poll numbers that showed 45% of Americans would blame Republicans for failing to avoid the fiscal cliff, while 34% would blame Obama. The public shift comes after Obama won re-election and Democrats increased their slim Senate majority and narrowed the GOP majority in the House in this month\u2019s election. In what have been secret talks so far, Obama and Congress are seeking to revive a possible \u201cgrand bargain\u201d to cut the chronic federal deficits and debt. Without a deal, tax cuts from 2001 and 2003 \u2013 when George W. Bush was president \u2013 will expire, raising rates for everyone starting in January. In addition, spending cuts would reduce spending on the military, national parks, the Federal Aviation Administration and other important government services. Pascrell: Social Security 'not on table' What Americans think of the fiscal cliff Norquist: 'Highlighting' pledge keepers However, the government and Congress still would have time to prevent draconian effects from the fiscal cliff when a new Congress convenes in January. Obama promotes his fiscal cliff solution William Galston, a senior fellow in governance studies at the Brookings Institution, called that a form of brinksmanship best avoided. \u201cTo be sure, no one believes that non-agreement by December 31 would be the end of the story. After a period of finger-pointing, discussions would resume,\u201d he wrote last week in a New Republic opinion piece. \u201cBut equally, no one knows how the failure to reach agreement before the end of 2012 would affect the dynamics of the negotiations.\u201d In addition, \u201cwe can be reasonably sure \u2026 that national and global markets would react adversely and that businesses, which are already retreating from planned investments in new plant and equipment, would become even more uncertain and risk-averse.\u201d The CNN/ORC International poll released Monday also showed that a solid majority of respondents \u2013 two-thirds \u2013 supports the Democratic stance that any agreement should include a mix of spending cuts and tax increases. Of that total, Republicans favor such an approach by 52%-44%. In particular, Obama and Democrats insist that wealthy Americans, so far identified as those with income higher than $200,000 for individuals or $250,000 for families, should pay more taxes than they do now so that rates for everyone else stay the same. However, the outgoing Congress in a lame-duck session for the rest of the year, as well as the new Congress to be seated in January, include large numbers of Republicans who signed the Norquist pledge. Come January, there will be 39 senators, including Chambliss and Graham, and 219 House members who endorsed it. Trending: Graham says he\u2019d break no-tax \u2018pledge\u2019 The House total constitutes a narrow majority in the 435-seat chamber, though some members have denounced their allegiance to the pledge. Some congressional conservatives sought to deflect attention from the Norquist pledge on Monday, focusing instead on the need to work out a deal that included concessions by Democrats. \u201cThe goal is to solve the problem,\u201d insisted Rep. Kevin McCarthy, the No. 3 House Republican in the incoming Congress. He rejected Obama\u2019s call for letting tax rates on income over $250,000 return to higher levels of the 1990s, telling CNN \u201cthat doesn\u2019t solve the problem\u201d because \u201cyou do nothing about the growth of government.\u201d Long a defining difference between Democrats and Republicans, the tax issue has stymied efforts to work out a deficit deal for the past two years. Obama and House Speaker John Boehner came close to agreement last year before conservative rejection of any increased revenue and liberal resistance to entitlement reform scuttled the effort. Boehner, the Ohio Republican who has emerged as party leader in the deficit talks, agrees to the concept of increased revenue, though he and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky both remain opposed to actually raising tax rates. Instead, they propose broad tax reform that will lower rates while eliminating unspecified loopholes and exemptions to spur economic growth that they say will result in more overall government revenue. \u201cIt\u2019s fair to ask my party to put revenue on the table. We\u2019re below historic averages,\u201d Graham told ABC. \u201cI will not raise tax rates to do it. I will cap deductions. If you cap deductions around the $30,000, $40,000 range, you can raise $1 trillion in revenue, and the people who lose their deductions are the upper-income Americans.\u201d At the same time, Graham and other conservative lawmakers demand that Democrats agree to significant reforms in entitlement programs such as Medicare and Medicaid, the government-run health care programs for senior citizens, the disabled and the poor. \u201cI will violate the pledge, long story short, for the good of the country, only if Democrats will do entitlement reform,\u201d Graham said. On the same program, Democratic Sen. Dick Durbin of Illinois said some changes to Medicare are needed, but he ruled out any reforms to Social Security, the national retirement plan, saying it is a separately funded system that \u201cdoes not add a penny to our debt.\u201d Noting opposition to entitlement reforms by traditional Democratic allies such as organized labor, Durbin said everyone has to realize that some changes are needed in Medicare and Medicaid. Fiscal cliff tax deal: Getting to $1 trillion \u201cThose who say \u2018don\u2019t touch it, don\u2019t change it\u2019 are ignoring the obvious,\u201d said the Senate\u2019s No. 2 Democrat, adding that \u201cwe can make meaningful reforms in Medicare and Medicaid without compromising the integrity of the program, making sure that the beneficiaries are not paying the price for it, except perhaps the high-income beneficiaries. That to me is a reasonable approach.\u201d However, Durbin balked at one proposal sought by Republicans \u2013 to slowly raise the eligibility age for Medicare above the current level of 65. \u201cWhat happens to the early retiree who needs health insurance before that person\u2019s eligible for Medicare?\u201d Durbin asked. \u201cMy concern about raising that Medicare retirement age is there will be gaps in coverage or coverage that\u2019s way too expensive for seniors to purchase.\u201d Graham rejected Durbin\u2019s point, saying the same change instituted in Social Security has worked. He also called for adjusting benefits based on the personal wealth of recipients, so that those with more money have to pay more for services. Norquist said Democrats will never agree to the negotiating position of Graham and other Republicans, calling the demand for entitlement reforms akin to a \u201cpink unicorn that doesn\u2019t exist.\u201d Read more: 8 things that could kill a fiscal cliff deal The political risk for Republicans to going against the no-tax pledge comes from angering Norquist and other conservatives who can target them in GOP primary campaigns in 2014 and beyond. Norquist said Monday his group would \u201ccertainly highlight who has kept their commitment and who hasn\u2019t\u201d when re-election time comes. \u201cThe key here is whether or not the Republicans will move away from the ideologically rigid position, which has been the Grover Norquist pledge,\u201d Democratic Sen. Carl Levin of Michigan told NBC on Sunday. \u201cYou\u2019ve got to raise additional revenues, including tax rates on the wealthy. They have to go up. Either real tax rates or effective tax rates, there are ways of doing that.\u201d Opinion: Can GOP handle prosperity?

            "article_content": "\"He's never promised me anything,\" Grover Norquist says about Sen. Saxby Chambliss Chambliss is the latest conservative to reject Norquist's pledge Congress returns to work next week facing the year-end \"fiscal cliff\" Without a deal, tax hikes and steep spending cuts will take effect next year Nothing riles up the tea party chattering class like a broken pledge against raising taxes. Just ask Sen. Saxby Chambliss, a veteran Georgia Republican who this week turned his back on the Taxpayer Protection Pledge he signed years ago as a rite of passage in right-wing politics. Immediately labeled \u201cworthless\u201d and \u201ca liar\u201d on the website Tea Party Nation, Chambliss symbolizes the political conundrum facing GOP leaders after President Barack Obama\u2019s re-election. After years of opposing higher taxes on anyone, Republicans now are under pressure to work out a comprehensive agreement to reduce the nation\u2019s chronic federal deficits and debt. That means a compromise with Obama and Democrats, who insist on more tax revenue being part of a package that includes spending cuts and entitlement reforms. GOP turning on Norquist? Economist: Tax wealth, not income Congress approaches fiscal cliff Brighter days ahead for U.S. economy? Congress returns to Washington next week after the Thanksgiving break with just over a month to work out the blueprint for a deal that would avoid the so-called fiscal cliff, a combination of steep across-the-board spending cuts and tax increases set to occur at the end of the year. Boehner: Obamacare on table for \u2018fiscal cliff\u2019 talks Facing imminent unpopular scenarios such as higher taxes for everyone and further cuts in military spending, the negotiations taking place behind closed doors in Washington have new impetus to produce results. Obama\u2019s victory this month with a slightly stronger Democratic majority in the Senate and a slightly weaker Republican majority in the House signaled general public acceptance of the president\u2019s main campaign theme: raising more tax revenue from the rich as part of a deficit-reduction package. In particular, Obama and Democrats insist that wealthy Americans, so far identified as those with income higher than $200,000 for individuals or $250,000 for families, should pay more taxes than they do now so that rates for everyone else stay the same. Norquist responds to senator\u2019s break with no-tax pledge However, the new Congress to be seated in January includes 39 senators, including Chambliss, and 219 House members who have signed the anti-tax pledge pushed by Grover Norquist of Americans for Tax Reform, according to the group\u2019s website. The House total constitutes a narrow majority in the 435-seat chamber, though some members have denounced their allegiance to the pledge much like Chambliss did Wednesday in an interview with CNN affiliate WMAZ, a Georgia television station. \u201cI care more about my country than I do about a 20-year-old pledge,\u201d said Chambliss, who faces re-election for a third Senate term in 2014. Referring to Norquist, who has vowed to oppose candidates who break the pledge, Chambliss said that \u201cif we do it his way, then we\u2019ll continue in debt, and I just have a disagreement with him about that.\u201d In response to Chambliss, Norquist told CNN that the senator \u201cwrote a commitment to the voters of Georgia.\u201d \u201cHe got elected and re-elected making that commitment,\u201d said Norquist. \u201cHe\u2019s never promised me anything.\u201d Norquist said he believes Chambliss was \u201ccaught\u201d on a TV station and that \u201che said some things perhaps that didn\u2019t make sense.\u201d If the senator wants to \u201cchange his mind and become a tax increaser,\u201d Norquist said, \u201che needs to have that conversation with the people of Georgia.\u201d Fiscal cliff helps mend Obama-CEO relations Chambliss acknowledged that Norquist and Americans for Tax Reform will likely work against his re-election because of the issue. \u201cBut I don\u2019t worry about that because I care too much about my country,\u201d Chambliss said, adding that he was \u201cwilling to do the right thing and let the political consequences take care of themselves.\u201d Possible consequences were evident on Friday. \u201cTo call Chambliss an idiot is to insult people of lower intelligence,\u201d blogger Judson Phillips of Tea Party Nation wrote. \u201cChambliss is a poster child for every thing that is wrong with the political class in Washington.\u201d Later in his post, Phillips sharpened his point: \u201cIf you give your word and you break your word, then you are a liar.\u201d Phillips also called Chambliss the worst RINO \u2013 Republican In Name Only \u2013 in Washington, citing an acronym that conservatives use for those they consider to be sell-out politicians. \u201cIf you are a worthless Republican politician and you want some good press from the liberal media,\u201d Phillips wrote, \u201call you have to do now days is say you are considering abandoning your pledge not to raise taxes.\u201d However, other conservative voices, including veteran Sen. Tom Coburn of Oklahoma, have questioned whether the Norquist pledge remains politically relevant in the face of the mounting federal debt and Obama\u2019s re-election. William Kristol, the editor of the Weekly Standard, said after the November 6 vote that Republicans should consider going along with the president\u2019s call for making the wealthy pay higher taxes, telling \u201cFox News Sunday\u201d that \u201cit wouldn\u2019t kill the country.\u201d On the same program, GOP Sen. Bob Corker of Tennessee said \u201cthe yin and the yang of this is that we know there has to be revenues.\u201d \u201cI haven\u2019t met a wealthy Republican or Democrat in Tennessee that\u2019s not willing to contribute more as long as they know we solve the problem,\u201d Corker noted, adding that reforming entitlement programs such as Medicare, the government-run health care system for senior citizens, was another key part of the package. Norquist and other conservatives argue that shrinking the government is the only way to properly address the deficit issue. Their mantra is that America spends too much on government, not that it collects too little in taxes. The Taxpayer Protection Pledge says the signer will \u201coppose any and all efforts to increase the marginal income tax rates for individuals and/or businesses\u201d and will \u201coppose any net reduction or elimination of deductions and credits, unless matched dollar for dollar by further reducing tax rates.\u201d Deficit reduction? Not without entitlement reform That commitment puts any adherents in conflict with the direction of the deficit negotiations under way between the White House and Congress. At the Center for the National Interest on Monday, Norquist predicted that Republicans would prevent any deficit deal from containing a tax increase. Long a defining difference between Democrats and Republicans, the tax issue has stymied efforts to work out a deficit deal for the past two years. Obama and House Speaker John Boehner came close to agreement last year before conservative rejection of any increased revenue and liberal resistance to entitlement reform scuttled the effort. Boehner, the Ohio Republican who has emerged as party leader in the deficit talks, agrees to the concept of increased revenue, though he and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky both remain opposed to actually raising tax rates. Instead, they propose broad tax reform that will lower rates while eliminating unspecified loopholes and exemptions to spur economic growth that they say will result in more overall government revenue. Chambliss, whose voting record got a perfect rating in 2010 from the American Conservative Union, has played a supporting role in the deficit debate. He joined colleagues from both parties in the so-called Gang of Six senators trying to work out a comprehensive deal on the sidelines of the main talks between the White House and Congress. Last year, Norquist\u2019s group called at one point for Chambliss and the other two Republicans to drop out of the Gang of Six talks that were considering increased tax revenue as part of the deal. Norquist later sent a letter to Chambliss and GOP colleagues Coburn and Sen. Mike Enzi of Wyoming to clarify that their stance met the conditions of the pledge because they wanted any increase in revenue to come from economic growth spurred by lower tax rates. \u201cThis is very encouraging news from you,\u201d Norquist wrote then. \u201cIt means that you will fulfill the Taxpayer Protection Pledge you made to your constituents and the American people to oppose and vote against legislated net income tax increases.\u201d Opinion: GOP must avoid the fiscal cliff CNN\u2019s Ashley Killough and Adam Levy contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "NEW: Reid: \"This isn't something we're going to wait until the last day of December to get it done\" Some moderate House Democrats are sending a message to both parties They say they want neither side to take \"a potential solution off the table\" The coalition signals it could be critical to getting a deal through the House President Barack Obama and congressional leaders wrapped up their first \u201cfiscal cliff\u201d meeting since the election Friday with a confident tone that had both sides suggesting an agreement could be reached before January 1, when hefty federal spending cuts and tax raises are scheduled to take effect. \u201cMy hope is that this will be the beginning of a fruitful process,\u201d said Obama, just prior to the meeting meant to avert the so-called fiscal cliff, which some economists warn could push the country into recession. \u201cOur challenge is to make sure that we can cooperate together,\u201d he said. Republican and Democrat leaders stood together after the White House talks, while House Speaker John Boehner said that Republicans recognize that neither side is going to get everything it wants. He added that a combination of revenue increases and spending cuts is needed. \u201cI believe that the framework that I\u2019ve outlined in our meeting today is consistent with the president\u2019s call for a fair and balanced approach. To show our seriousness, we\u2019ve put revenue on the table \u2013 as long as it\u2019s accompanied by significant spending cuts,\u201d Boehner said. Long the sticking point between the president and congressional Republicans, increased revenue is sure to be at the center of any discussion. To the president, it means allowing Bush-era tax cuts on wealthy Americans to expire at the end of the year and returning to Clinton-era rates for high-income earners. But to Republicans, it has come to mean closing loopholes in the tax code and ending deductions without raising rates. For his part, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid simply promised progress. \u201cThis isn\u2019t something we\u2019re going to wait until the last day of December to get it done. We have a plan. We\u2019re going to move forward on it,\u201d he said. Fiscal cliff talks beginning today Greenspan on the economy Obama and leaders meet on fiscal cliff Warren Buffett talks 'fiscal cliff' Ahead of the meeting, members of the New Democrat Coalition, a group of centrists, sent a letter to Obama, Boehner and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi. \u201cWe cannot have a full debate that allows us to address the multitude of issues facing our country if either side takes a potential solution off the table,\u201d it said. With both parties suffering losses of moderate members in the election, this new coalition is signaling it could be a critical bloc of votes in getting a deal through the House. Boehner could potentially lose a chunk of votes from conservatives if final details on new revenue don\u2019t meet their approval. Major changes to entitlements could mean Pelosi would lose support from the progressives in the House who believe there shouldn\u2019t be any benefit cuts. Obama and Vice President Joe Biden met with Boehner, Pelosi, Reid and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell in the Roosevelt Room on Friday. \u201cWe don\u2019t happen to think that the government needs more revenue. Government spends too much as it is,\u201d McConnell said on the Senate floor Thursday. But he added that if Democrats are willing to agree to reform entitlement programs, \u201cwe\u2019ll be there.\u201d Boehner on Wednesday acknowledged a \u201cspirit of cooperation\u201d between the two sides of the aisle in the House and the president, and he said he would remain optimistic. But as he\u2019s done every time he\u2019s publicly addressed the issue, the speaker restated his opposition to allowing any tax rates to go up. \u201cThere are ways to put revenue on the table without increasing tax rates,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve talked about this now for over a year.\u201d The New Democrat group\u2019s letter was carefully crafted to avoid taking sides on any specific proposals on tax reform or structural changes to Medicare, Medicaid or Social Security. It pointed out that bipartisan commissions have already drawn up plans that reduce the deficit through a combination of spending cuts and new revenue, but the group didn\u2019t endorse any one formula. And when leaders of the group were pressed to answer whether Democrats would go along with significant changes to entitlement programs \u2013 such as changing the eligibility age for Medicare \u2013 they didn\u2019t answer directly and instead said they remain open to everything. \u201cAt the very beginning, before we\u2019ve even sat down at the table, how about we agree that everything stays on the table until we\u2019ve had a chance to discuss it,\u201d said Rep. Gerry Connolly, D-Virginia. Earlier, Pelosi repeatedly said she wants to see a \u201cgrand bargain\u201d \u2013 the catch-all term for a major deficit reduction package that includes some combination of tax reform, spending cuts and entitlement reforms. But when asked what kind of entitlement changes she could accept, she said those programs should be dealt with separately from discussions about tax cuts. \u201cThose issues \u2013 Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid \u2013 they should be in their own realm. Whatever adjustments would be made in Social Security should be there to strengthen Social Security, not to subsidize a tax cut for the wealthiest people in America and say that\u2019s how we balance a budget. The same thing with Medicaid and Medicare,\u201d Pelosi said. Rep. Allyson Schwartz, D-Pennsylvania, said the group \u201cisn\u2019t trying to go around their own leadership\u201d and wants to work with both parties. She said she was encouraged by what top Republicans were saying on being open to new revenue, but she seemed to echo Pelosi on entitlements, saying they are part of a longer-term solution. Rep. Ron Kind of Wisconsin, the incoming chairman of the New Democrat Coalition, insisted that no one should be drawing bright lines on any issue and compared fiscal cliff negotiations to those between Israel and Palestinian leaders. \u201cWe all know what we need to do \u2013 it\u2019s like the Middle East peace plan. Everyone knows where we need to end up; we just need to figure out the political process to get there,\u201d he said. The New Democrat Coalition grew after this month\u2019s election, from 42 members to as many as 52 or 53, depending on the results of the handful of unresolved House races. That equates to roughly one-quarter of the overall House Democratic caucus. Similar to the \u201cBlue Dog\u201d Democrats, another group of fiscal conservatives who played a major role in health care negotiations, this group emphasizes bipartisan solutions. The ranks of the Blue Dogs, who hail mainly from Southern states, were decimated in the 2010 election, and the group will have fewer members \u2013 about 15 \u2013 heading into the next Congress after the retirement of several members. A challenge facing moderate Democrats is they don\u2019t wield significant power in the leadership. Pelosi and the rest of the current leadership are expected to stay essentially the same in the next Congress. While No. 2 Democrat Steny Hoyer is viewed as more ideologically moderate, and often is the bridge to those members, the rest of the leaders have ties to the more liberal elements of the caucus. The New Democrats do have the potential of gaining a seat at the leadership table \u2013 its current chairman, Rep. Joe Crowley of New York, is vying for the post of vice chairman of the caucus, against Rep. Jared Polis of Colorado and Rep. Barbara Lee of California.  Several Democratic aides expect Crowley to win the spot when the elections are held after Thanksgiving.",

            "article_content": "President Barack Obama invites congressional leaders to White House for meeting next week Obama and John Boehner discuss speaking carefully in public to leave room for a deal Boehner has urged Obama to \"lead\" while opposing any tax increases in a deal Deal must be reached by the new year to avoid tax increases, defense cuts After winning re-election, one of President Barack Obama\u2019s first moves was to call House Speaker John Boehner. The two have rarely spoken since their \u201cgrand bargain\u201d on debt reduction fell apart in the summer of 2011, but they will have to re-engage to implement tax and spending changes essential to avoiding the economic disaster Washington calls the \u201cfiscal cliff.\u201d According to Democratic and Republican sources, the call was courteous and short, and one source said the two men discussed the need to speak carefully in public to leave room to cut a deal in private. Boehner spoke publicly on Wednesday and again Friday morning when he called on the president to \u201clead\u201d while repeating his opposition to any tax increases in a deficit deal. Boehner: U.S. can avoid financial cliff Obama's second-term agenda Consequences of failing to compromise Sources close to the process on Capitol Hill said the two parties will need to find a way to get revenue under the existing rates and address entitlement reform. Obama has already made clear he is willing to negotiate on entitlement reform and invited bipartisan congressional leaders to the White House next week for a meeting. CNNMoney: What\u2019s in the fiscal cliff? In his address at the White House Friday afternoon, the president stressed the importance of congressional action and compromise, including a bill to protect 98% of Americans who will experience a significant tax hike at the end of the year if a deal is not reached. \u201cI\u2019ve got the pen ready to sign the bill right away,\u201d Obama said in the White House East Room, referring to the plan to extend tax cuts for those making under $250,000 a year. \u201cI\u2019m ready to do it; I\u2019m ready to do it.\u201d The president said the election proved Americans are on his side in regard to taxes and entitlement reform. \u201cOur job is to get the majority in Congress to reflect the will of the people,\u201d he said, before adding he was encouraged by Boehner\u2019s openness to tax revenue. Obama held firm on the ideas he espoused on the campaign trail that were also included in a detailed plan the White House sent to Capitol Hill in fall 2011. But there is not much time to negotiate before the new year, a time frame further limited by the Thanksgiving holiday and a just-announced trip by the president to Asia. Got questions about the fiscal cliff? We\u2019ll get the answers Republicans sources argued it is unlikely the parties can resolve the sticking points in a lame-duck session of Congress, adding they need to agree on a framework deal that can be resolved in 2013. But don\u2019t expect any eye-popping new positions. Sources said the president believes he\u2019s been exceedingly clear about how he would like to avoid the painful cuts that would kick in. Throughout his campaign he reiterated his positions while also making clear he would not sign a bill that retained the current low tax rates for the richest Americans. There\u2019s not much time to negotiate. In the days between now and the new year, the nation\u2019s leaders will face three events in quick succession: \u2022 First, the Bush-era tax cuts will expire on December 31, triggering a return to higher Clinton-era rates unless new policy is set. \u2022 Second, $1.2 trillion of painful automatic budget cuts will be triggered \u2014 the \u201csequester\u201d \u2013 unless Congress finds a way to bring that sum into the nation\u2019s coffers. \u2022 Third, the country will hit a new debt ceiling midspring. These events, especially the sequester, could have a devastating impact on the economy, pushing it over the fiscal cliff. A new report by the Congressional Budget Office underscored the urgency of getting a deal done. Its nonpartisan analysts concluded that if the spending cuts take effect, a fiscal crisis will ensue. They also determined that if the spending cuts hit and the tax cuts are allowed to expire \u2013 which would raise money for the government \u2013 it would drive unemployment up to 9.1%. In other words, inaction is a bad option. \u201cThat\u2019s a cliff no one wants to go over,\u201d Obama senior strategist David Axelrod said. Leaders on both sides have signaled that they\u2019re hopeful that the election will lead to a new spirit of compromise in the capital. Democrats and Republicans largely agree that the cleanest solution is to address all three crises with a massive reform effort that would both cut government spending and bring in more revenue. It would include changes to the personal tax code, entitlements and debt reduction targets. CNNMoney: CBO warns of fiscal cliff risk But, as usual, the devil\u2019s in the details. Obama administration officials have said the president will veto any package that extends the Bush-era tax cuts for those making $250,000 a year or more. \u201cI\u2019ve already signed a trillion dollars\u2019 worth of spending cuts. I intend to do more, but if we\u2019re serious about the deficit, we also have to ask the wealthiest Americans to go back to the rates that they paid when Bill Clinton was in office,\u201d the president said as recently as last week. Before the election, the president\u2019s policy director, James Kvaal, explained Obama wants \u201ca balanced plan that cuts the deficit by $4 trillion with $2.50 worth of spending cuts for every dollar in revenue and reduces spending on Medicare, Medicaid and other entitlements.\u201d CNNMoney: Raising taxes is not the same as raising revenue If a spirit of compromise grips the capital after the election, the best-case scenario is a framework deal: In November and December, the parties would agree to general targets for revenue increases and spending cuts plus new tax terms and then work out the details six or nine months down the road. In this rosy scenario, the nation would avoid a new year\u2019s tax hike and the ugly sequester. Sen. Dick Durbin, D-Illinois, said he thinks a deal is possible. \u201cWe have a chance in the lame duck to at least start the process, and I think there\u2019s a chance to rally bipartisan support,\u201d he said in an interview before Tuesday\u2019s election. \u201cThese are basic issues we can work out, and the president is in a position to do that.\u201d Not everyone is so sunny. Several Democrats said the president has learned from past negotiations with House Republicans and this time will be ready to stand his ground. One top Democrat with close ties to leaders on Capitol Hill and the White House said, \u201cObama\u2019s leverage is he doesn\u2019t have to do anything and everyone\u2019s taxes go up.\u201d \u201cThat\u2019s a huge forcing mechanism,\u201d one added. Several senior Democrats told CNN they believe the president would be prepared to allow that increase, which would affect personal income tax, the estate tax, dividends and capital gains taxes. Adding to the potential for a protracted struggle, it\u2019s widely believed that the $1.2 trillion in spending cuts kick in immediately at the start of 2013. However, multiple sources aware of talks said there is wiggle room and that austerity cuts could be delayed to create more time for a deal. As a result \u2013 in theory at least \u2013 negotiations could continue before the economy takes a direct hit. Given the influence of Republican super PACs, there is concern among Democrats that Republicans would not get on board with a compromise unless GOP \u201cbig money\u201d gets behind them, offering cover for the midterm elections. Durbin insisted that Obama is hoping for the best with the tax cuts and the sequester but said the president won\u2019t yield on either. \u201cThe president isn\u2019t going to put either gun in the holster until we have this showdown under way,\u201d Durbin said.

            "article_content": "House campaigns and super PACs supporting them far outspending 2010 rates Most experts see between 50 and 60 races key; 435 being contested Two years after tea party propelled historic midterm shift, few in GOP claim that mantle GOP presidential running mate Paul Ryan's Medicare reform plan is a wedge, Democrats believe There may be little drama left in the outcome, but you wouldn\u2019t know that by watching the final days of campaigning in the battle for the U.S. House. Democratic and Republican congressional campaign committees and outside groups for both parties are ramping up spending and committing tens of millions of dollars to those races. Though Republicans, who control the House by a 242-193 margin, are in good shape to keep the majority, the National Republican Congressional Committee isn\u2019t letting up and is on track for record spending \u2013 more than $60 million, according to a committee spokesman. Find your polling place Underscoring how critical the final weeks of the campaign are, the Republican campaign committee planned to spend $45 million in the six weeks before Election Day. That\u2019s the same amount the GOP campaign arm spent altogether in 2010 when Republicans won back control of the House. Down-ballot races to keep an eye on Can Obama keep his promises? Rep. Ellison calls challenger 'scumbag' Romney tax plan depends on Congress Republicans are also getting significant help from outside groups \u2013 several GOP-backed super PACs are targeting races alongside the congressional campaign committee, and they\u2019re plugging holes with television ads in some districts where the House GOP campaign arm isn\u2019t spending money. The American Action Network, a conservative policy group, and Congressional Leadership Fund, the Super PAC affiliated with it, spent about $25 million combined in September and October on TV spots, radio, and mail in over 20 House races, mostly defending GOP incumbents. The YG Action Fund, a super PAC run by former aides to House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, has targeted most of its resources toward helping Republican challengers and has spent  $10 million  to $12 million to help elect those candidates it believes will be the next generation of GOP leaders. American Crossroads, the super PAC created by former Bush adviser Karl Rove, has targeted $10 million for House races. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce has also spent millions in support of House Republican candidates. Democrats, meanwhile, are working to keep pace with their own spending. Despite an open acknowledgement by many Democrats that regaining control of the House is an uphill battle, they\u2019re not cutting back on resources. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and its allies are also dedicating record amounts of money in 2012. The Democratic campaign committee has spent $34 million already, and had a total of $54 million to spend over the course of the campaign. Campaign explorer Last week it took out a $17 million line of credit for the closing days, though a senior Democratic campaign official says it was unlikely the committee would use the full loan. And while they are quick to complain about the influence of outside money, Democrats are also getting major assistance from groups supporting Democratic candidates. The House Majority PAC spent $35 million over the 2012 election cycle \u2013 $7 million of which will be spent in the final two weeks. Andy Stone, the spokesman for House Majority PAC told CNN, \u201cWe will make serious gains for sure.\u201d Labor unions, like the Service Employees International Union and the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, are also chipping in for television spots and mobilizing members in targeted races. Battle being played on narrow playing field All 435 members of the House face voters on Tuesday, but control of the chamber ultimately rests on roughly 50 to 60 competitive races due partly to redistricting. The number of swing districts has continued to shrink over the years as GOP legislatures shored up their seats and Democratic-led state houses strengthened their party\u2019s districts. Democrats need to pick up 25 Republican seats to flip control, something that House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi repeatedly argues is within reach. Pelosi conceded Democrats would lose some seats when she told CNN recently that Democrats would need to \u201cnet 25 seats,\u201d and several veteran campaign analysts said the total number of seats Democrats need to win is between 35 and 40. Pelosi and other Democrats pointed out that currently there are 58 Republicans representing districts won by Obama in 2008 and hold those up as their blueprint to a successful election night. But David Wasserman, who analyzes House races for the Cook Political Report, says Democrats are really only waging competitive campaigns in 32 of those districts, which isn\u2019t enough to win the House back. Despite Pelosi\u2019s public optimism, multiple other Democratic members and aides say a more realistic goal for the party is to pick up between five and 15 GOP-held seats on election night. Stuart Rothenberg, an independent campaign analyst, projected last week that Democrats would gain between two and eight seats next Tuesday. A senior House GOP campaign official told CNN on Wednesday that despite others predicting Republicans will lose seats, they believe they will actually gain between four and six. A key part of House Democrats\u2019 strategy is to target more than a dozen so-called \u201corphan districts\u201d \u2013 congressional seats in states where the presidential campaign is not active and where  Obama is expected to carry the state handily. CNN Poll of Polls For example, Democrats are trying hard to unseat GOP incumbents in California, New York, and Obama\u2019s home state of Illinois. GOP incumbents in those states can\u2019t count on momentum from the presidential ticket, and high turnout for Obama works against them. Right after Republicans took control in 2010, House Speaker John Boehner recognized this weak spot and focused a major effort to support the mostly GOP freshmen in these states. Boehner has personally raised more than $10 million to help build local organizations and traveled extensively to stump for these candidates. Back in April he raised the prospect of potentially significant losses in orphan districts, his remarks intended to warn Republicans focused on the presidential race and the battle for the Senate not to take GOP control of the House for granted. The battleground for many of these House races has tilted increasingly toward the northeast and Midwest, after so many moderate Democrats lost in southern districts in the 2010 midterms. In Illinois, Democrats see opportunities to defeat tea party freshman Rep Joe Walsh, seven-term Rep Judy Biggert, and a moderate Republican freshman Rep. Bob Dold. Democrats have also set their sights on freshmen Reps. Nan Hayworth, Chris Gibson, Ann Marie Buerkle, and Michael Grimm in New York. Former President Bill Clinton held a rally on Sunday in New York for Sean Patrick Maloney, his former aide who is running against Hayworth. He also recently held an event for five California Democrats, another area where campaign officials argue they can upset several GOP incumbents. California Rep. Xavier Becerra, one of Pelosi\u2019s top lieutenants, told CNN a combination of wins in orphan districts, combined with pickups sprinkled around the country could translate into a path to the majority. But even Becerra conceded, \u201cwe\u2019d need a wind\u201d to get those kind of gains.  With a bitterly contested presidential election in 2012 that\u2019s expected to be close it\u2019s not the political environment for any kind of wave election. Because the GOP picked up 63 seats in the 2010 midterms the bulk of their efforts are geared toward protecting incumbents. But there are several places where Republican challengers are on the offense. Rep. Pete Sessions, chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee, noted on CNN\u2019s \u201cStarting Point\u201d last week several places where he believes his party can topple some veteran Democratic members, like Rep. Jim Matheson, D-Utah, Rep. Tim Bishop, D-New York, and Rep. John Tierney, D-Massachusetts. \u201cWe have an African-American, as matter of fact, Haitian-American candidate in Utah that\u2019s doing a great job. We have a guy, Randy Altschuler, downtown literally in New York, New York City, out on the island, probably is going to win his race. We have Richard Tisei in Massachusetts, a man who\u2019s going to win, a Republican in Massachusetts,\u201d Sessions said. Senior GOP officials also point out that  they have put traditionally blue seats in Rhode Island and  Connecticut in play this cycle, forcing Democrats to spend their own resources  defeding those districts. North Carolina moderate Democrats Larry Kissell and Mike McIntyre, who both survived the GOP tsunami in 2010, are battling strong challenges. Two years after tea party fuels GOP win, fades as 2010 factor House Republican candidates are still stressing the core issues that the tea party movement pushed in 2010 \u2013 less government and a focus on cutting federal spending and the deficit, but as one senior GOP strategist working on House races explained, they are \u201cnot wearing the tea party label on their sleeves.\u201d Democrats, bolstered by polling that shows that many voters blame the tea party as the reason for gridlock in Washington, continue to try to pin the label on virtually every Republican incumbent and challenger. House Democrats\u2019 campaign chief Rep. Steve Israel, D-New York, argued to reporters last month that the \u201cTea Party Republican Congress has a 13% approval rating,\u201d and maintained Democrats have a chance to regain the majority because \u201cthere is a deep sense of buyer\u2019s remorse spreading throughout this country.\u201d Even in a solidly blue state like Massachusetts, Democrats are trying to brand Tisei, who already said he would break with his party on taxes, as a tea party Republican. Democrats say control could hinge on unease over Wisconsin Representative and vice presidential nominee Paul Ryan\u2019s Medicare plan. Pelosi insists that Romney\u2019s pick of Ryan as his running mate was the game-changing moment in the battle for the House. \u201cMark your calendar, August 11th, the day he was chosen gave a clarification to the issue of Medicare,\u201d Pelosi said about Ryan on CNN earlier this month. \u201cThis is a person who has been the destroyer of Medicare guarantee,\u201d she added. Democrats had already been highlighting the Ryan Medicare proposal across the country, but they believe that giving it national prominence helped make their case that the dramatic overhaul the House Budget Committee chairman proposed would prove too alarming to voters. Democrats hold up their win in a special election last May in upstate New York when Democrat Kathy Hochul linked Ryan\u2019s proposal to her GOP opponent Jane Corwin and took over what had been a reliably red seat. But one top GOP strategist told CNN that that upstate New York special election \u201cwas the best thing that ever happened to us. It prepared us, it opened us up, and it gave us a year to explain our plan.\u201d Other Republican aides say the national congressional campaign committee regrouped last fall and developed a response that they used in a special election in Nevada. Republicans argued it was the Democrats who were gutting Medicare \u2013 by using more than $700 million in reductions for payments to physicians to pay for Obamacare. The GOP candidate Mark Amodei won that election and the strategy has been replicated by candidates ever since. While Republicans admit Democrats have traditionally had an  advantage when it comes to Medicare they believe House GOP  candidates  have been able to neutralize the issue by  not letting charges go unanswered and by tying the debate to the economy. \u201cThey\u2019ve put all their eggs in a message basket that didn\u2019t work,\u201d a senior official from the NRCC told CNN. With the bulk of this cycle\u2019s competitive races concentrated in districts represented by the more moderate members of each party, the outcome of this election will mean an even more polarized House in 2013. The GOP conference will include even more conservatives and the likely loss of more moderate Democrats, whose ranks were already decimated in 2010, will tilt the Democratic caucus further to the left. A recent study by the Cook Political Report of all congressional districts found that the number of swing districts in the United States went from 164 to 99 in the last 14 years.  That decline will undoubtedly have an impact on the ideological divide between the two parties in the House not just this year, but in future elections. \u201cThere\u2019s a remarkable reduction in the number of members who have an incentive to compromise,\u201d Wasserman told CNN. Key House race snapshots Compiled by Adam Levy and Robert Yoon, CNN Political Research Arizona 1: Jonathan Paton (R) vs. Former Rep. Ann Kirkpatrick (D) Open Republican-held seat This redrawn district covers most of northern and eastern Arizona. The Democratic nominee is Ann Kirkpatrick, who was elected in 2008 and was swept out in the Republican wave two years later. The Republican nominee is Jonathan Paton, a former state senator. Kirkpatrick has a sizeable fundraising advantage over Paton, but national Republicans have invested heavily in this race to help close the gap in TV ads. This seat is a top priority for both parties. Arizona 2: Rep. Ron Barber (D) vs. Martha McSally (R) This is the district that Democrat Gabrielle Giffords would have run in had she sought a fourth term. Giffords was shot and wounded in January 2011 in Arizona and continues to recover. Her district director Ron Barber was also injured but won a special election to fill her seat when she resigned from the House last January. His opponent is Republican Martha McSally, a retired Air Force colonel and combat pilot. Barber had a significant financial advantage at the start of October though McSally has remained competitive on the airwaves. Still, Barber is expected to win. Arizona 9: Kyrsten Sinema (D) vs. Vernon Parker (R) New district The battle for this new district pits Democrat Kyrsten Sinema, a former state senator, against Republican Vernon Parker, the former mayor of Paradise Valley. Both parties have invested heavily in the race, though a Democratic super PAC has tipped the TV ad war balance of power slightly in the Democrat\u2019s favor. California 30: Rep. Brad Sherman (D) vs. Rep. Howard Berman (D) Merged district One of the nastiest House races of 2012 is between two incumbent Democrats due to redistricting and the state\u2019s new primary system, where the top two finishers advanced to the general election. Rep. Brad Sherman has at least one advantage over Rep. Howard Berman: He represents more of the redrawn Sherman Oaks-area district. Sherman won the primary with 42.4% of the vote compared to 32.4% for Berman. The remaining votes were split among five candidates. The bitter race hit a nasty patch in mid October when the two men shouted at each other at a public forum. The moment was caught on video and a police officer could be seen taking the stage preparing to intervene. Both have received heavyweight endorsements. Independents and Republicans could play the decisive role. California 31: Rep. Gary Miller (R) vs. Bob Dutton (R) Seven-term incumbent Rep. Gary Miller faces a tough challenge from a fellow Republican in a race also determined by California\u2019s new primary system. Miller\u2019s opponent is Bob Dutton, a state senator and businessman. Miller does not currently represent any of this redrawn district, while Dutton represents much of it in the state legislature. Money could play a decisive role in the race. At the start of October, Dutton had only $58,000 in the bank, compared to the $816,000 in Miller\u2019s war chest as of October 17. Miller edged Dutton in the June top-two primary, 26.7%-24.8%, with the remaining 49% divided among four Democrats. Those Democratic voters will likely decide whether Republican Miller returns to Washington for an eighth term. California 36: Rep. Mary Bono Mack (R) vs. Raul Ruiz (D) Rep. Mary Bono Mack, who is seeking an eighth full term in the House, is a frequent target of Democrats hoping to pick off a Republican in a Democratic district. This year, she finds herself fending off a strong challenge from Democrat Raul Ruiz, a Mexican-American, Harvard-educated physician with a compelling personal story. His background could appeal to the district\u2019s growing Hispanic population. But Bono Mack has survived strong challenges before and has a relatively moderate voting record. She also prevailed over Ruiz in her first one-on-one matchup, the June \u201ctop-two\u201d primary in which they appeared together on the same ballot. California 44: Rep. Laura Richardson (D) vs. Rep. Janice Hahn (D) Merged district Redistricting has forced another pair of Democratic incumbents to face off this November. Rep. Janice Hahn won a July 2011 special election to replace retiring Democratic Rep. Jane Harman. Rep. Laura Richardson was elected in a 2007 special election to replace the late Juanita Millender-McDonald. Hahn appears to have a clear advantage in the race due in part to an ongoing ethics saga for Richardson that has resulted in a reprimand and $10,000 fine by the House Ethics Committee for campaign finance violations involving her congressional staff. Hahn also enjoyed a huge fundraising and cash-on-hand advantage at the start of October. Hahn trounced Richardson in the primary. Florida 9: Former Rep. Alan Grayson (D) vs. Todd Long (R) New district In just one term in Congress, Democrat Alan Grayson mastered the art of making headlines with his blunt and abrasive rhetorical style. During the debate over health care, he said the Republican health care plan was, \u201cDon\u2019t get sick, and if you do get sick, die quickly.\u201d He also said on CNN that Republicans were \u201cfoot-dragging, knuckle-dragging Neanderthals.\u201d In a 2010 TV ad, he called his Republican opponent Daniel Webster \u201cTaliban Dan.\u201d Although he quickly became a hero among liberals, Grayson went on to lose his bid for a second term by a staggering 18 points. Grayson is running in a new district in the Orlando suburbs and his Republican opponent is Todd Long, an attorney, small businessman and conservative radio show host. Florida 18: Rep. Allen West (R) vs. Patrick Murphy (D) Rep. Allen West is a top target for Democrats The freshman Republican\u2019s sharp rhetoric during his first term has not endeared him to colleagues across the aisle. For instance, West last summer emailed Democratic National Committee Chairman Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz that she was \u201cthe most vile, unprofessional and despicable member of the U.S. House of Representatives.\u201d West\u2019s Democratic opponent is Patrick Murphy, a businessman and executive with a construction firm. West has a huge fundraising advantage but Murphy has been running ads and the race is very competitive. Florida 26: Rep. David Rivera (R) vs. Joe Garcia (D) The race in Florida\u2019s southernmost congressional district is a rematch of 2010, but the dynamics could not be more different. Republican incumbent David Rivera was elected in the Republican wave two years ago. Democrat Joe Garcia, a former Miami-Dade County Democratic party chairman who lost by nine points. The key difference this time around is that Rivera has been dogged by scandal and ethics issues. The district is still Republican-friendly and Garcia enters the final stretch in better position than two years ago. Georgia 12: Rep. John Barrow (D) vs. Lee Anderson (R) Democratic incumbent John Barrow is fighting for his political life in this heavily Republican district, which is far better than Republicans expected at this point when they drew the district\u2019s boundaries. According to an analysis by the Cook Political Report, President Barack Obama\u2019s 2008 vote percentage in Barrow\u2019s new district is 44%, compared to 55% under the old lines. Despite the unfavorable political landscape, Barrow has made the race competitive. He has far outpaced his Republican opponent, state Rep. Lee Anderson, in fundraising. He also has been in general election mode from the start compared to Anderson, who emerged weakened from a competitive primary. Illinois 2: Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr. (D) vs. Brian Woodworth (R) Rep. Jesse Jackson Jr.\u2019s biggest obstacle to a ninth full term in Congress might be himself. Jackson has been on medical leave since June for an undisclosed ailment, which his office later described as a \u201cmood disorder.\u201d In mid-October, CNN confirmed that Jackson was the subject of a federal investigation over possible financial improprieties. In late October, Jackson released a campaign robocall to constituents saying he was undergoing treatment for \u201cseveral serious health issues\u201d and asked for \u201cyour continued patience as I work to get my health back.\u201d Republican opponent Brian Woodworth, an attorney and university professor, has criticized him for leaving the district unrepresented. Despite his absence, Jackson is expected to win fairly easily. Illinois 8: Rep. Joe Walsh (R) vs. Tammy Duckworth (D) Freshman Republican Joe Walsh is high on the list of most endangered GOP incumbents. Walsh barely won his seat in 2010 and redistricting has made it more Democratic. He has the additional misfortune of running in a presidential election year with favorite son Barack Obama heading the ticket for the other party. Walsh also has made headlines with various controversial statements, including most recently one that medical science has advanced to the point where abortions are never necessary to save a woman\u2019s life. Democrat Tammy Duckworth, decorated Iraq war veteran, led in fundraising and enters the final stretch with an advantage. Illinois 10: Rep. Robert Dold (R) vs. Brad Schneider (D) Republican Robert Dold won this Democratic-friendly district in the Republican wave of 2010, replacing fellow Republican Mark Kirk, who ran for the U.S. Senate. The redrawn district is more  Democratic-friendly, but Dold has kept the race competitive. His Democratic opponent is businessman Brad Schneider, who emerged battered from a competitive primary. Dold entered the final month of the campaign with a huge cash advantage but Schneider has benefited from sizable TV ad buys from the national Democratic party and from a pro-Democratic super PAC, but he still trails the overall TV ad dollars invested by Dold, the national Republican party and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. Iowa 3: Rep. Tom Latham (R) vs. Rep. Leonard Boswell (D) Merged district Iowa was one of 10 states to lose seats in Congress because of redistricting, setting up a member-on-member showdown between two veteran lawmakers in a merged Des Moines-area district. Democrat Leonard Boswell represented much of this new district in the late 1990s. Republican Tom Latham has a considerable fundraising advantage due in part to his close friendship with House Speaker John Boehner. The cash advantage is apparent on the airwaves, where Latham has outspent Boswell, even when counting the considerable assistance the Democrat has received from his national party. Boswell is no stranger to tight races. He survived the Republican wave of 2010. The presidential race will boost Democratic turnout, but his new district has many more \u201cred\u201d counties than the one he\u2019d represented for the past 10 years. The race will be competitive. Iowa 4: Rep. Steve King (R) vs. Christie Vilsack (D) Republican incumbent Steve King\u2019s bid for a sixth term in Congress will be his toughest. King won re-election in his old western Iowa district with 66% of the vote in 2010, and he\u2019s never dipped below 59% in any of his previous races. This year, he faces a new district and a tough new challenger in Democrat Christie Vilsack, Iowa\u2019s former first lady and the wife of U.S. Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack. The good news for King is that his enormous new district in the northwest part of the state is comprised mostly of counties won by John McCain in 2008. King has had a fundraising advantage over Vilsack.  But Vilsack is the strongest possible candidate Democrats could have fielded. She has been competitive financially. The political makeup of the district is still a bit of a reach for a Democrat. Louisiana 3: Rep. Charles Boustany (R) vs. Rep. Jeff Landry (R) Merged district As in California, redistricting and a \u201ctop-two\u201d primary system have forced two incumbent lawmakers of the same party into a November showdown. Republican Charles Boustany, a surgeon elected in 2004, faces freshman Republican Jeff Landry, an attorney and businessman, former police officer and tea party favorite. Boustany represents significantly more of the new district than Landry, but the freshman proved he is capable of pulling off surprises when he defeated the better-known former Louisiana House speaker in the 2010 primary. Under state law, the November election will serve as an open primary, in which the top two finishers will advance to a December runoff if no one gets a majority. Maryland 6: Rep. Roscoe Bartlett (R) vs. John Delaney (D) By all accounts, Republican Roscoe Bartlett\u2019s bid for an 11th term appears to be his last. The long-time western Maryland representative was a top target for Democrats who redrew the district last year. As a result, his once-safe seat now stretches from the state\u2019s westernmost point to include a sizable piece of heavily Democratic Montgomery County and now reaches almost to the District of Columbia border. His Democratic opponent is John Delaney, a wealthy businessman. Delaney pulled an upset in the Democratic primary over Rob Garagiola, a state senator with a string of endorsements from party establishment-types, including Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley. Bartlett has little hope of pulling out a miracle. Massachusetts 4: Joe Kennedy III (D) vs. Sean Bielat (R) Open Democratic-held seat When Democratic Rep. Patrick Kennedy of Rhode Island left office in January 2011, it ended his family\u2019s 64-year streak of service in Congress that began with the swearing-in of freshman congressman John F. Kennedy. In 2012, Democratic congressional candidate Joe Kennedy III, grandson of Robert F. Kennedy, hopes to begin a new streak by replacing retiring Rep. Barney Frank in the 4th Congressional District. Kennedy, a former prosecutor and Peace Corps member, is heavily favored to win; no member of his family has ever lost a race in Massachusetts. His opponent is  Republican Sean Bielat, a businessman and Marine Corps reservist. Massachusetts 6: Rep. John Tierney (D) vs. Richard Tisei (R) Rep. John Tierney is in danger of becoming the first Democrat to lose a U.S. House race in Massachusetts since 1994. The eight-term incumbent has been dogged by a financial scandal involving his wife and her brothers and an illegal gambling operation. The Republican nominee is Richard Tisei, a former state senator who is openly gay.  Tierney has been pounded with more than $3 million in ads this cycle from Tisei, the national Republican Party and pro-Republican groups, eager to defeat a Democrat in Massachusetts. The district is Democratic but the ongoing scandal appears to have taken a toll.  A September Boston Globe/University of New Hampshire poll had Tisei with 37%, Tierney with 30% and 30% undecided. Minnesota 6: Rep. Michele Bachmann (R) vs. Jim Graves (D) Tea party favorite Michele Bachmann was a shoo-in for re-election when she folded up her presidential campaign in January. Ten months later, Bachmann still has the advantage but she faces a tough challenger in Jim Graves, a wealthy businessman. Graves has waged a competitive race in October, spending $1.2 million in TV ads, compared to $1.7 million for Bachmann. The conservative congresswoman has never posted huge numbers on Election Night, but redistricting has made her district slightly more Republican. Defeating a high-profile conservative like Bachmann would be a nice win for Democrats, but she is not at the top of the list of vulnerable Republican incumbents. Nevada 4: Steven Horsford (D) vs. Danny Tarkanian (R) New district There\u2019s a competitive race in Nevada\u2019s newest congressional district. The nominees are Democrat Steven Horsford, the state senate majority leader, and Republican Danny Tarkanian, a businessman and son of UNLV basketball coaching legend Jerry Tarkanian. The younger Tarkanian was a 2010 U.S. Senate candidate but placed third in the Republican primary. The two candidates have been fairly evenly matched in terms of fundraising as well as the assistance they\u2019ve received from their national parties and from outside groups in terms of TV ads. The district leans slightly Democratic. The outcome could be affected by competitive races for president and U.S. Senate higher up on the ballot. New Hampshire 1: Rep. Frank Guinta (R) vs. Former Rep. Carol Shea-Porter (D) As was the case in 2010, Republican Frank Guinta and Democrat Carol Shea-Porter face off in the battle for New Hampshire\u2019s 1st Congressional District. This time, Guinta is the incumbent and Shea-Porter is the challenger. Shea-Porter was elected in the Democratic wave of 2006 and served two terms before losing to Guinta in 2010, 54%-42%. The two are fairly evenly matched in fundraising. The race is competitive. A strong showing by Obama or Romney at the top of the ticket will be an important factor. New Hampshire 2: Rep. Charlie Bass (R) vs. Ann McLane Kuster (D) Republican incumbent Charlie Bass faces Ann McLane Kuster. Kuster lost to Bass in the general election in 2010 but is running again, and she has outraised Bass, though they started October with roughly the same amount in the bank. The Democrat has far outspent her opponent on the airwaves even though the national Republican Party has invested funds on behalf of Bass.  A WMUR/University of New Hampshire poll from early October had Kuster at 38%, Bass 35%, with 25% unsure. The district is more Democratic than the state\u2019s other region, which works in Kuster\u2019s favor. New York 24: Rep. Ann Marie Buerkle (R) vs. Former Rep. Dan Maffei (D) Rep. Ann Marie Buerkle was elected in the Republican wave of 2010 and now has to defend her seat from the man she defeated. Democrat Dan Maffei, a longtime Capitol Hill staffer, won this upstate New York district in 2008 after it had been in Republican hands for almost 30 years. He lost the seat to nurse and tea party favorite Buerkle in one of the closest House races that year. The two have been evenly matched in both fundraising and TV ad spending. The district now leans slight more Democratic, which doesn\u2019t help Buerkle, who only managed to win this seat by about 600 votes. North Carolina 7: Rep. Mike McIntyre (D) vs. David Rouzer (R) Democratic Mike McIntyre is running a competitive race despite a newly redrawn district that skews heavily Republican. The Republican nominee is David Rouzer, a state senator. McIntyre, an eight-term incumbent, leads in fundraising and has kept even with ad spending by pro-Republican outside groups and the national Republican party. Rouzer has stayed off the airwaves. Similar to fellow southern Democrat John Barrow in Georgia, McIntyre is showing surprisingly strong signs of life in a district that was essentially drawn to end his career. Ohio 9: Rep. Marcy Kaptur (D) vs. Samuel \u201cJoe the Plumber\u201d Wurzelbacher (R) Samuel Wurzelbacher, better known as \u201cJoe the Plumber,\u201d became a conservative icon in the 2008 presidential race when he challenged then-candidate Obama on tax policy at a campaign event. Republican John McCain even mentioned him during the third presidential debate. Four years later, Wurzelbacher is running for Congress in a quixotic race against 15-term incumbent Democrat Marcy Kaptur, who is a safe bet for re-election. Kaptur handily defeated fellow Democrat Dennis Kucinich in a primary earlier this year. Ohio 16: Rep. Jim Renacci (R) vs. Rep. Betty Sutton (D) Ohio\u2019s most competitive House race pits freshman Republican incumbent Jim Renacci against three-term Democratic incumbent Betty Sutton. Since August, the two have benefited from about $2 million in ad spending on their behalf from parties and outside groups, while Renacci\u2019s campaign has about doubled Sutton\u2019s campaign in ad spending. the merged district, located in northeastern Ohio near, but not including, Cleveland, Akron, and Canton, leans Republican but the race remains up for grabs. Tennessee 4: Rep. Scott DesJarlais (R) vs. Eric Stewart (D) Republican physician Scott DesJarlais was elected to Congress in the Republican wave of 2010, defeating Democratic Rep. Lincoln Davis. He was a safe bet for re-election until a recent revelation that he had pressured a girlfriend to have an abortion a decade ago. DesJarlais was separated from his wife at the time. The Democratic nominee is Eric Stewart, a state senator. He has begun making an issue of the incident but the impact on DesJarlais\u2019 campaign in this rural, conservative district remains unclear. Texas 23: Rep. Francisco Canseco (R) vs. Pete Gallego (D) Republican Francisco \u201cQuico\u201d Canseco is one of many freshman members elected in the GOP wave of 2010 who now finds himself in a competitive race for a second term. Canseco was a wealthy commercial real estate developer when he won his third bid for this seat two years ago, defeating Democratic incumbent Ciro Rodriguez. After a legal battle over the redistricting process, Canseco ended up with a district that is slightly more Democratic \u2013 President Obama carried it in 2008 with 51%, according to the Cook Political Report.The Democratic nominee is Pete Gallego, a state representative who defeated former Rep. Rodriguez in the primary. Hispanics make up 66% of voters. Utah 4: Rep. Jim Matheson (D) vs. Mia Love (R) As Utah\u2019s only Democratic member of Congress, Jim Matheson is used to close races. He barely squeaked by in 2010 with 50% of the vote. This year may prove to be Matheson\u2019s toughest race yet. His Republican opponent is Mia Love, the mayor of Saratoga Springs who would become the first female African-American Republican to serve in Congress. Love is a rising star in the party and was giving a prominent speaking role at this year\u2019s Republican National Convention. The two have been relatively evenly matched in fundraising. This is one of the most competitive and highest profile House races in the country. Wisconsin 1: Rep. Paul Ryan (R) vs. Rob Zerban (D) Being named Mitt Romney\u2019s vice presidential running mate has not affected Paul Ryan\u2019s chances at getting re-elected to the House. He is a safe bet for against Kenosha County Supervisor Rob Zerban. Ryan has been asked multiple times whether he\u2019s hedging his bets by running for re-election while also running for vice president but the question is irrelevant. Ryan was tapped for the ticket after the deadline had passed to have his name removed from the House ballot. He\u2019s far from the first running mate to run for two jobs at once. Vice President Joe Biden was in the same position in 2008. Wisconsin 7: Rep. Sean Duffy (R) vs. Pat Kreitlow (D) Rep. Sean Duffy was one of the higher-profile freshmen elected in the Republican wave of 2010. He was a former Ashland County district attorney and tea party favorite, but he was probably best known for his work as a professional lumberjack athlete and ESPN commentator and as a cast member on MTV\u2019s reality show \u201cThe Real World.\u201d This year he faces a tough challenge from Pat Kreitlow, a former state senator and former local TV news anchor. Redistricting gave Duffy a more-GOP-leaning district. He also enjoys a financial advantage. Despite these advantages, this remains the most competitive House race in Wisconsin.",

            "article_content": "Mitt Romney surrogate Chris Christie praises President Barack Obama's response to Sandy The superstorm focuses attention on the role of government in disaster relief Romney advocates a state-led approach, but his campaign promises enough funding Obama emphasizes federal, state and local cooperation When Chris Christie praises President Barack Obama as \u201coutstanding\u201d and \u201cincredibly supportive,\u201d you know something extraordinary has occurred. Obama updated on Sandy; praised by Christie In this case, it was once-in-a-lifetime Superstorm Sandy, which caused the outspoken Republican governor of New Jersey to declare a state of emergency and seek federal help for widespread devastation. Interviewed Tuesday on NBC, Christie described Obama\u2019s response as \u201coutstanding,\u201d and he told CNN that the president had been \u201cincredibly supportive and helpful to our state.\u201d \u201cThis is much more important than any election,\u201d Christie told CNN\u2019s \u201cPiers Morgan Tonight.\u201d Obama has \u201cbeen outstanding to deal with on this and I look forward to seeing him tomorrow so he can see for himself what this hurricane has done to my state,\u201d Christie said Tuesday night. Such effusive praise from a frequent Obama critic and strong supporter of Republican presidential challenger Mitt Romney put the campaign magnifying glass on a key election issue \u2013 the role of the federal government \u2013 a week before the November 6 vote. Photos: Aftermath of Superstorm Sandy Romney's new focus: storm relief President Obama: Sandy 'is not over' Romney: A tiny effort makes a difference Obama vows relief for Sandy victims Romney: Storm will be a 'difficult time' It also focused attention on how Romney would handle such a disaster if he were to defeat Obama in what is expected to be a very close election. On Tuesday, the GOP candidate showed little inclination to address the matter. At a campaign event changed to a storm relief effort in Ohio, Romney ignored shouted questions by reporters on whether he supported the Federal Emergency Management Agency\u2019s role in disaster relief. Instead, he focused his remarks to supporters who donated relief supplies for storm victims on how such efforts contribute to meeting the overall need. \u201cWe won\u2019t be able to solve all the problems with our effort this morning,\u201d Romney said, adding \u201cone of the things you learn in life is you make the difference you can, and you can\u2019t always solve all the problems yourself.\u201d Romney on storm aftermath: \u2018People are hurting\u2019 Democratic critics of Romney and his running mate \u2013 conservative House Budget Chairman Paul Ryan of Wisconsin \u2013 argue their proposals to cut government spending and provide broad tax cuts without generating more government revenue will end up harming the economy and increasing the federal deficit. Photos: New York recovers from Sandy In particular, the Obama campaign challenges Romney\u2019s contention that increased economic growth from the tax cuts combined with shifting current federal responsibilities to states, the private sector and humanitarian agencies and charities can balance the budget. Last year, Romney argued at a Republican presidential debate in New Hampshire that cutting federal spending should be based on prioritizing what is absolutely necessary and shedding the rest. Asked by moderator John King of CNN if disaster relief efforts should be turned over to states, Romney said that \u201cevery time you have an occasion to take something from the federal government and send it back to the states, that\u2019s the right direction. And if you can go even further and send it back to the private sector, that\u2019s even better.\u201d \u201cInstead of thinking in the federal budget, what we should cut \u2013 we should ask ourselves the opposite question. What should we keep?\u201d Romney added. \u201cWe should take all of what we\u2019re doing at the federal level and say, what are the things we\u2019re doing that we don\u2019t have to do? And those things we\u2019ve got to stop doing, because we\u2019re borrowing $1.6 trillion more this year than we\u2019re taking in.\u201d King cut in to ask if Romney was referring specifically to disaster relief, a topic in the news at the time following a deadly Joplin, Missouri, tornado, and Romney continued: \u201cWe cannot afford to do those things without jeopardizing the future for our kids. It is simply immoral, in my view, for us to continue to rack up larger and larger debts and pass them on to our kids, knowing full well that we\u2019ll all be dead and gone before it\u2019s paid off. It makes no sense at all.\u201d Romney: States should handle emergency management With then-Hurricane Sandy bearing down on the East Coast on Monday, Romney\u2019s debate comments from 16 months earlier became a topic of political discussion, and the Romney campaign issued a statement in response. Sandy reminds us of climate change and other forgotten campaign issues \u201cGov. Romney believes that states should be in charge of emergency management in responding to storms and other natural disasters in their jurisdictions,\u201d said the statement by spokeswoman Amanda Henneberg. \u201cAs the first responders, states are in the best position to aid affected individuals and communities, and to direct resources and assistance to where they are needed most. This includes help from the federal government and FEMA.\u201d Henneberg added another sentence to the statement Tuesday, saying that \u201ca Romney-Ryan administration will always ensure that disaster funding is there for those in need. Period.\u201d Opinion: Sandy shows why we need FEMA Craig Fugate, administrator of the emergency management agency, told reporters Tuesday that the agency had $3.6 billion remaining in its disaster relief fund. The agency works with state and local authorities as well as the American Red Cross and other agencies to help disaster victims rent temporary housing, repair their homes, get loans to cover small business and farm losses, as well as assisting in cleaning up storm debris including hazardous materials. Vice President Joe Biden, meanwhile, said Tuesday that the federal response to Sandy was \u201cworking like it\u2019s supposed to,\u201d and he highlighted to reporters in Ohio what he described as unprecedented cooperation between city, state and federal authorities and agencies. A White House statement also emphasized such cooperation, noting Obama spoke by phone with a host of Republican and Democratic governors and mayors from states affected by the storm. Sandy\u2019s impact: State by state Romney has made political dysfunction in Washington a target of his campaign, blaming Obama for what he calls failed leadership in being unable to forge a deficit reduction deal with Republicans. Democrats blame Republicans for what they contend has been an unwillingness to compromise, and the focus on cooperation Tuesday by Obama and Biden appeared to be aimed in part at demonstrating the administration\u2019s ability to get things done. The question of the size and scope of the federal government is at the heart of both campaigns. Obama and Democrats argue that entitlement programs such as Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid are vital to the social contract to provide contributing citizens with basic needs, and that government also has a role to play in education and technological development while providing services such as national defense and disaster relief. Opinion: Sandy debunks \u2018nanny state\u2019 Republicans, driven by the party\u2019s conservative wing, call for immediate steps to erase the chronic budget deficits and mounting federal debt that they say imperil national security and stability. They want to shrink the size of government and reduce taxes while reforming entitlements by partial privatization, reducing and delaying some benefits and other steps. Sensitive issues such as disaster relief generally play to the advantage of Democrats and their support for government benefits, especially in a time of crisis when images of suffering victims dominate the airwaves. Superstorm Sandy breaks records Obama has avoided any direct political talk in recent days as the huge storm approached the Eastern seaboard, canceling campaign events and focusing his attention on the administration\u2019s response. In statements Monday and Tuesday on the storm and its aftermath, he emphasized the need for a collective response while also making sure to point out the federal role in relief efforts. \u201cWe\u2019ve been able to get over 1,000 FEMA officials in place, pre-positioned,\u201d the president said. \u201cWe\u2019ve been able to get supplies, food, medicine, water, emergency generators, to ensure that hospitals and law enforcement offices are able to stay up and running as they are out there responding.\u201d He also sounded a main campaign theme by ensuring those hit hardest by the storm that his administration and the entire nation were with them. \u201cThis is a tough time for millions of folks across the Eastern seaboard, but America is tougher and we are tougher because we pull together, we don\u2019t leave anybody behind, we make sure that we respond as a nation,\u201d Obama said. Obama visits Red Cross: \u2018Storm is not yet over\u2019 At about the same time he spoke, the White House announced that Obama will travel to New Jersey on Wednesday \u201cwhere he will join Gov. Christie in viewing the storm damage, talking with citizens who are recovering from the storm and thanking first responders who put their lives at risk to protect their communities.\u201d While the president and one of Romney\u2019s top supporters will be photographed together responding to disaster, Romney is scheduled to be in Florida for three campaign events. How to help after the superstorm CNN\u2019s Rachel Streitfeld, Kevin Liptak, Tom Watkins and Mike M. Ahlers contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Biden came armed with statistics and bluster VP also proved he had some punch in him, but was it too much? Just what is malarkey? America wanted to know Ryan meets challenge of looking like he's ready for the job Vice President Joe Biden and Republican Paul Ryan, the man who wants his job, exchanged fire over taxes, Medicare, national security and some animated facial expressions in their only debate before Election Day. Here are five things we learned from Thursday night: 1. Biden brought it We expected Ryan, not Biden, to bring a three-ring binder full of facts and figures to the debate. It\u2019s not that the data-driven Ryan didn\u2019t show up with an arm full of his statistics; it is just that Biden did so as well. And Biden\u2019s aggressive offense from the very beginning drowned out Ryan until about 45 minutes into the debate. Biden\u2019s 36 years in the Senate served him well Thursday night. Who says that delivering hundreds of floor speeches on Capitol Hill isn\u2019t useful? The vice president also proved wrong the critics, who predicted he was going to make a gaffe. He didn\u2019t. VP debate: Promises, platforms, zingers Ryan: Romney cares about 100% Best zingers from VP debate 'Malarkey,' 'shirtless' trend in debate In many ways, Biden stole a page from Mitt Romney\u2019s debate playbook: put your head down, charge forward and don\u2019t stop. Romney effectively employed this strategy last week, and Barack Obama was never able to recover. While Ryan put up a fight last night, he, too, was unable to regain his footing. The many expressions of Joe Biden An Obama-Biden campaign official said before the debate that the vice president\u2019s goal was to try to compare and contrast the two competing campaigns\u2019 vision for the future. Whether you agree or disagree with the specifics of the Obama-Biden or Romney-Ryan plans, Biden did a better job of selling his last night. It will be several days until we know if this debate has helped the Obama-Biden campaign stem the political bleeding. But Biden did what he needed to do. 5 Independent perspectives on the VP debate 2. Too much Joe? If Biden was on a mission to bring the fight to Ryan, then it appeared to be mission accomplished for the vice president. Moments into the debate, Biden went on the attack. \u201cOn Iraq, the president said he would end the war. Gov. Romney said that was a tragic mistake,\u201d said Biden. Minutes later the vice president pushed back against criticism by the Wisconsin congressman, saying \u201cnot a single thing he said is accurate.\u201d Feisty vice presidential debate sets up Obama-Romney rematch And he called other accusations by Ryan \u201ca bunch of stuff.\u201d Biden went where President Barack Obama wouldn\u2019t last week in his debate with Romney, bringing up Romney\u2019s \u201c47%\u201d controversy as well as the Republican nominee\u2019s tax rate. And later, when Ryan discussed President John F. Kennedy\u2019s tax policies, Biden fired back: \u201cOh, now you\u2019re Jack Kennedy?\u201d \u201cThe vice president came and showed fight. He showed his boss what it is to engage and engage and engage and attack and attack and attack,\u201d said CNN Chief National Correspondent John King. \u201cI think Joe Biden did do his boss a lot of help,\u201d agreed Senior CNN Political Analyst David Gergen, who\u2019s advised both Democratic and Republican presidents. But was Biden too aggressive? \u201cI think Joe Biden is an authentic person. He speaks his mind. People know him. They expect that,\u201d Obama senior adviser David Axelrod said. \u201cI think that authenticity is something that people appreciate.\u201d The Romney campaign disagreed. Poll: Debate watchers split on who won \u201cThe sighing, the eye-rolling, the grinning. I don\u2019t know if the vice president knew that there was a camera on him the whole time, that there was a split screen,\u201d senior Romney campaign adviser Russ Schriefer said. \u201cEven if we thought he was making good points, I think that they stepped on his good points. He was trying to cram everything in that he could that wasn\u2019t in the last debate to try and get it all out at once. But I don\u2019t think he made any kind of coherent argument as to why the Obama-Biden ticket should be re-elected.\u201d Gergen agreed: \u201cOn style I think that Paul Ryan won the debate. The Biden dismissive laughs, the interruptions, the sort of shouting, I think that Ryan was calmer and frankly more presidential.\u201d What did debate watchers think? Seven out of 10 debate watchers in a CNN/ORC International poll said that Biden was the aggressor. Opinion: Hyper Biden, wonky Ryan 3. Does the debate even matter? The short answer is no. People don\u2019t vote for vice presidents at the ballot box. They vote for presidents. Past vice presidential debates, no matter how high the drama, have ultimately done little to move the needle in modern elections. Not surprisingly, Biden\u2019s scenery-chewing performance was viewed differently by both campaigns. The Romney campaign said he looked erratic, rude and unhinged. The Obama campaign said he laid out the facts and made Ryan look, in the spin room words of former Ohio Gov. Ted Strickland, \u201clike a lightweight.\u201d But a common refrain from both campaigns after the debate was that it will probably have a minimal effect on the race one way or the other. 25 funniest tweets about the VP debate The biggest impact of the night, and the reason Democrats were ebullient after the debate, was the base-rallying impact of Biden\u2019s aggressive and blustery stage presence. In the wake of Obama\u2019s wilting flower routine in last week\u2019s debate, the full Biden, exasperated and angry with Romney and Ryan, was just what Democrats needed. How happy was team Obama? Campaign surrogates stayed in the spin room with puffed chests for much longer than they did in Denver, when they offered dubious messaging before escaping. The campaign immediately sent out a fundraising plea. President Obama put himself in front of cameras after landing at Andrews Air Force Base to praise Biden\u2019s performance. And it wasn\u2019t just the Obama camp. Democratic state parties, liberal interest groups and down-ballot campaigns rushed to send out fundraising e-mails to capitalize on a fired-up base. You didn\u2019t see much of the same on the Republican side. The debate launched a fresh news cycle that will put a temporary halt to the \u201cChicago in disarray\u201d storylines. Now the pressure is on President Obama to keep that narrative going next week in New York. First two debates couldn\u2019t be more different 4. Ryan rises to challenge It was arguably Ryan\u2019s biggest task in the vice presidential debate. As the running mate to the Republican challenger, Ryan needed to convey that he\u2019s fit to serve should something happen to the commander in chief, that he would be acceptable to Americans as president. Known as an expert on economic and budget issues, early in the debate Ryan showed his smarts on foreign policy. During a discussion on troop drawdowns in Afghanistan, he explained how the seasonal changes affect the fighting in Afghanistan. Opinion: Sports bar Biden vs. seminar Ryan \u201cThe mountain passes fill in with snow. The Taliban and the terrorists and the Haqqani and the Quetta Shura come over from Pakistan to fight our men and women. When it fills in with snow, they can\u2019t do it. That\u2019s what we call fighting seasons. In the warm months, fighting gets really high. In the winter, it goes down,\u201d explained Ryan. \u201cAnd so when Adm. Mullen and Gen. Petraeus came to Congress and said, if you pull these people out before the fighting season ends, it puts people more at risk. That\u2019s the problem.\u201d \u201cI think Ryan proved himself unexpectedly competent on foreign policy,\u201d said Republican strategist and CNN contributor Alex Castellanos, who worked for Romney\u2019s 2008 presidential bid. \u201cI think Ryan met his test tonight. Ryan looked very reasonable.\u201d As expected, the Obama campaign disagreed. \u201cI think Congressman Ryan was out of his depth and showed clearly the ticket is not ready for prime time on foreign policy, and I think that was a decisive difference between the two sides,\u201d said Obama campaign manager Jim Messina. So what do debate watchers think? Did Ryan pass the competency test? Six out of 10 debate watchers in the CNN/ORC poll conducted said that Ryan is qualified to be president. Who won Thursday\u2019s debate? Martha Raddatz 5. Malarkey moves numbers \u201cMalarkey\u201d is one of Biden\u2019s favorite Biden-isms. He\u2019s been saying it for decades, but not usually with the kind of gusto he showed on Thursday before millions of prime time television viewers. Soon after the debate began, when Ryan criticized the Obama administration\u2019s foreign policy, Biden fired back: \u201cWith all due respect, that\u2019s a bunch of malarkey.\u201d What does malarkey mean? People apparently rushed to their computers to find out. \u201cMalarkey,\u201d it turns out, was the third-most-searched debate-related term of the night on Google. It was also trending on Twitter for a good chunk of time. For the record: it\u2019s basically the Irish-American term for \u201cnonsense.\u201d According to Google, the other top searches during the debate were \u201cBiden,\u201d \u201cconflating,\u201d \u201cWho is winning the debate\u201d and \u201cHow old is Paul Ryan.\u201d Read a transcript of the debate or watch it online",

Historian Doris Kearns Goodwin says debates reveal character strengths and weaknesses 1960 debate contrasted \"vigorous\" Kennedy with \"sallow\" Nixon Reagan's humor defused Carter's indignation in 1980 debate With a glance at his watch, George H.W. Bush underscored Clinton's ability to connect Presidential historian Doris Kearns Goodwin says that even though a lot of modern debates are programmed, there are still moments that no one expected. \u201cAnd it\u2019s sort of like championship boxing,\u201d she says, \u201cyou do get revelations of character, of temperament, of humor, of anger, and you get a feeling of this person during these one-on-one debates that really nothing else can provide.\u201d Goodwin describes 10 key presidential and vice presidential debates that made a difference: 1960 \u2013 Kennedy vs. Nixon: First TV debate Debates enter the TV age Just having Kennedy on the same stage as an experienced vice president made a difference for JFK because he could hold his own with Nixon. But then, of course, when it was listened to on the radio, it made it seem like it was pretty equal, and even some people giving an edge to Nixon. But he looked so terrible. His makeup was bad. He wasn\u2019t feeling well. He looked sallow, He looked scornful. And people just reacted to that image of a vigorous, young Kennedy, and an almost sick-looking Nixon. And from then on, somehow JFK became a figure. iReport: 10 questions you would ask at the presidential debate 1976 \u2013 Carter vs. Ford: No Soviet domination of Eastern Europe? Ford: 'There is no Soviet domination' Ford had done well in the first debate, but in the second debate he was asked a question about Soviet domination of Eastern Europe. And he answered it incomprehensibly. There was already a perception, a vulnerability, that he wasn\u2019t intelligent. And then this thing just got parodied, just got talked about, and became a huge event. When ordinary people watched that debate, they didn\u2019t feel the Ford had screwed up. But when it was pointed out, that he didn\u2019t understand what was happening in the Cold War in Eastern Europe, then suddenly they had shifted their minds, and he seemed much worse than it had seemed at that moment. 1980 \u2013 Reagan vs. Carter: \u2018There you go again\u2019 Reagan: 'There you go again' In 1980, Carter was primed to go after Reagan about his record, especially on Medicare. He was going on the offensive: \u2018You did this! You voted this way! You said that!\u2019 And Reagan, just with humor and subtlety, said, \u2018There you go again.\u2019 And it somehow relaxed Reagan and it took the offensive  away from Carter. It was a brilliant answer to a really serious critique of Reagan\u2019s past that might have been troubling for him. 1980 \u2013 Reagan vs. Carter: \u2018Are you better off now than you were four years ago?\u2019 Reagan: 'Are you better off?' There was no more brilliant closing than Reagan\u2019s \u2018Are you better off now than you were four years ago?\u2019 What it did was to make people think, \u2018Yes. That\u2019s what\u2019s happened to me. My economic life, my family life, my working life, has been hurt by the economy over these last four years.\u2019 And once they realized that, it almost gave a poster to the entire campaign. It wasn\u2019t just a great moment in the debate, it became a theme encapsulated in just a few sentences. And in the end saying, \u2018if you are better off, then you vote for Mr. Carter. If you\u2019re not, you do have another choice. Me,\u2019 And at the same time, Carter gave a very weak closing statement. Opinion: When candidates said \u2018no\u2019 to debates 1984 \u2013 Mondale vs. Reagan: \u2018I will not exploit \u2026 my opponent\u2019s youth and inexperience\u2019 1984: Reagan jokes about Mondale's youth In the first debate between Reagan and Mondale, Reagan had appeared old. He was the oldest candidate in history at that time. He seemed confused by some of the questions, his answers had wandered, and the issue of age really became a large question among the press. So when he comes back in the second debate, and they ask him, \u2018Do you think age is a problem?\u2019 He had that answer prepared, and boy did he nail it. It was subtle, it was humorous, and Mondale knew, he said right then, that he had not only lost the debate, but probably the election. 1988 \u2013 Dukakis vs. George H.W. Bush: \u2018If your wife, Kitty Dukakis, were raped and murdered?\u2019 1988: 'If Kitty Dukakis were raped...' The question asked to Michael Dukakis in 1988 was a difficult one. I mean, \u2018What would you do, given your feelings about the death penalty, if your wife, Kitty Dukakis, were raped and murdered?\u2019 And what you would\u2019ve expected might have been a home run, where Dukakis would\u2019ve said, \u2018I would\u2019ve wanted to kill that person who murdered my wife. But we have a country of laws and that would be wrong.\u2019 But instead, he answered in a policy-wonkish way about the death penalty that underscored a vulnerability that he already seemed to be without emotion and without passion. 1988 \u2013 Bentsen vs. Quayle: \u2018You\u2019re no Jack Kennedy\u2019 1988: Bentsen: 'You're no Jack Kennedy' During the campaign, Quayle had already been saying many times that he had as much experience as Jack Kennedy did, so Bentsen was primed for that and when he mentioned it again in the debate, I\u2019m sure Bentsen was saying \u2018Yay! Here comes my line!\u2019 And again, Quayle handled it OK and said it probably wasn\u2019t called for but it was such a zinger of a line that people loved it and told one another about it and it became the line of that debate. Opinion: The mistakes candidates make in debates 1992 \u2013 George H.W. Bush looks at his watch Bush checks the time It looked like he was bored, that he didn\u2019t care about the debate and that underscored the feeling that he wasn\u2019t connected to the problems of the people and the country. He later said when he was looking he was looking at his watch he was thinking, \u2018I hate these debates, I\u2019m so glad it\u2019s almost over.\u2019 In that debate Clinton showed his empathy \u2013 he was wandering around the stage. He talked to the people, almost wrapped their arms around them. The debate format in that year was perfect for Clinton because they could wander away from the microphones. When Bush is seen stiffly to be looking at his watch and seemed not engaged, and not connected, it underscored Clinton\u2019s enormous capacity to emotionally connect. 1992 \u2013 Stockdale vs. Gore vs. Quayle: \u2018Who am I? Why am I here?\u2019 1992: 'Who am I? Why am I here?' When [Ross] Perot had chosen [Adm. James] Stockdale as his [running mate], Stockdale appeared to in that debate to be stunned; he almost didn\u2019t seem to belong there. He looked like an observer of the other two candidates and that was underlined when he said, \u2018Who am I, what am I doing here?\u2019 What it underscored was a problem of judgment on Perot\u2019s part \u2013 how could he have chosen somebody who himself was wondering, \u2018Why am I here?\u2019 It made no sense to the audience and it hurt Perot\u2019s credibility as a presidential candidate. 2000 \u2013 Al Gore sighs Al Gore sighs while Bush speaks Focus groups right after Al Gore and George W. Bush debated seemed to give a slight edge to Gore because he was more articulate, he had better answers, but once the television cameras caught that sighing, that constant look on his face where he seemed annoyed by the whole idea of having to be there with Bush, it seemed to underscore, as somebody said, as a teacher\u2019s pet who knew all the answers but was annoying and irritating. And they kept playing it over and over again and it became parodies on the comedy shows and late night TV. Then people began to project onto Gore a personality trait of just annoyance and irritation of people in general and it became devastating for him to live that down.",

            "article_content": "Both presidential campaigns are telling \"half truths\" about the opposing side Creative editing of comments is accepted with a wink and a nod by partisan voters The practice thrives even though media, other groups doing more to challenge campaigns The presidential campaigns and their surrogates have gotten away with slicing up quotes and slinging half truths, in part, because those views reinforce what partisan voters want to hear. President Barack Obama\u2019s \u201cIf you\u2019ve got a business \u2013 you didn\u2019t build that\u201d comment at a July campaign event was excerpted, slapped on the Internet and flipped into the Republican rallying cry \u201cWe Built It.\u201d Obama was actually suggesting many businesses and other enterprises have benefited from government infrastructure. Mitt Romney\u2019s \u201cThere are 47 percent of the people who will vote for the president no matter what\u201d remark at a secretly recorded fundraiser in May became \u2018Romney only cares about half of the country\u2019 and was used as fodder for an Obama campaign ad. Tweaking, bending, and embellishing facts have long been part of U.S. politics. It continues today as campaigns barrel toward Election Day even though media outlets and outside groups are dedicating more time and resources to how candidates and campaigns parse and spin their messages. \u201cWhat\u2019s different this time isn\u2019t that they are twisting the facts, it\u2019s the tremendous volume of ads that do so,\u201d said Bill Adair, editor of PolitiFact and Washington bureau chief of the Tampa Bay Times. \u201cThe ads are wall to wall not just from the Obama and Romney campaigns but also from the super PACs that support each of them.\u201d Partisan politics creates a healthy environment for fact blurring. \u201cIn our increasingly polarized political environment, partisans are increasingly likely to believe what they want to believe. The actual facts apparently matter less and less,\u201d said Marc Hetherington, a political science professor at Vanderbilt University. Is Romney getting fair media coverage? Fact check: Obama, Romney China ads Who are the 47%? CNN Reality Check: 4.5M jobs created? \u201cMuch of this tendency is driven by the fact that people who identify with one party increasingly hate the other party. When you can\u2019t stand the other side, you are willing to believe just about anything about it, whether it is true or not,\u201d said Hetherington. Why politicians lie and why we want to believe them People are inclined to believe what they want to believe, said Stanley Renshon, an expert in the psychology of social and political behavior at the City University of New York. \u201cThe basic idea here is if it fits in with the stereotype, it gets some legs,\u201d Renshon said. \u201cThe truth about stereotypes is there is often some truth in them.\u201d Believe that Obama wants to redistribute wealth? Romney sure wants you to believe it. During a fundraiser last week, he pointed to a section of a 1998 recording of an Obama speech that the GOP candidate says proves his point. That point is \u201cmostly true\u201d according to PolitiFact.  As an Illinois state senator, Obama did say, \u201cI think the trick is figuring out how do we structure government systems that pool resources and hence facilitate some redistribution because I actually believe in redistribution, at least at a certain level, to make sure that everybody\u2019s got a shot.\u201d PolitiFact also points out that \u201cObama spoke of redistribution in a way that government can create a level playing field for everyone and encourage competition. The clip of the 1998 audio that Romney referenced to criticize Obama doesn\u2019t tell the complete story.\u201d Believe Romney would remove Medicare as guaranteed benefits? That\u2019s what an Obama ad claims as \u201cfact.\u201d That, too, is \u201cmostly true,\u201d according to PolitiFact. \u201cIt\u2019s plausible that the Romney plan could provide less of a \u2018guarantee\u2019 than Medicare currently does, but we found sharp disagreement between supporters and opponents of Romney\u2019s Medicare plan on that point. This disagreement is hard to resolve given the shortage of information Romney has so far provided,\u201d the site found. Questions of truth are not new to presidential campaigns. Campaign 2012: Smoke and mirrors or outright lies In fact, Romney grew up watching his father\u2019s words twisted. George Romney\u2019s \u201cI had the greatest brainwashing that anybody can get\u201d quote about a trip to Vietnam that influenced his decision to switch positions on the war there were taken out of context and helped end his presidential ambitions in the late 1960s, Renshon said. What Romney, who like his son now was attacked by critics as weak on foreign policy, was saying was: \u2018\u201cI  got a briefing that was misleading and because I trusted the people who gave me the briefing it was inaccurate,\u201d\u2019 Renshon said. John Kerry\u2019s \u201cI actually did vote for the $87 billion before I voted against it\u201d comment in 2003 about wartime spending legislation was fuel for opponents who characterized him as a flip-flopper in the next year\u2019s presidential campaign. \u201cThere may have been a good explanation Kerry could have given,\u201d Renshon said. \u201cThe tone of it conveys he wants to have it both ways \u2026 that got translated into flip-flopping.\u201d Such out of context attacks have the biggest impact on undecided voters, said Ron Riggio, an organizational psychology professor at Claremont McKenna College. \u201cFor those on the fence, the weight of these attacks might just cause enough pain to register and influence them,\u201d Riggio said. The media is also at fault, political experts say. \u201cReporters don\u2019t do a very good job of context themselves,\u201d Renshon said. Journalists \u201care generalists. \u2026 On a quick time schedule there\u2019s no time to get into it.\u201d The sheer volume of information available on the Internet, both true and bogus, has made the business of adding context and teasing out fact from fiction \u201cmore democratic because people have a variety of views fighting it out in the media space,\u201d Renshon said, adding that people often use this information to back up views they already hold. In this type of environment, non partisan fact checking becomes even more important, Adair said. \u201cThere is more fact-checking this year than ever,\u201d Adair said. \u201cI think when we look back on this campaign, I think we will say that fact-checkers played an important role in sorting out the truth for people.\u201d",

            "article_content": "NEW: In Ohio, Mitt Romney strengthens attacks on President Obama NEW: A new poll shows Obama got a convention bounce The Obama campaign out-raised Romney in August The campaigns spar over Medicare and taxes Mitt Romney strengthened his attacks on President Barack Obama on Monday in the face of a new CNN/ORC International poll that indicated the Republican challenger in November is losing ground after last week\u2019s Democratic National Convention. \u201cHe wants to fundamentally transform America,\u201d an energetic Romney said of Obama in the vital battleground state of Ohio, accusing the president of moving the country toward a debt-laden, big government society similar to failing European nations like Greece. Noting that \u201cforward\u201d is Obama\u2019s campaign slogan, Romney said to cheers that \u201cforewarned\u201d would be more appropriate. \u201cWe know what would happen if he were re-elected,\u201d Romney shouted. \u201cWe\u2019d see more years of high unemployment. We\u2019d see more years of massive deficits. We\u2019d see more years of almost no wage growth in this country. We\u2019d see more years of a nation at the cusp of the kind of crisis you\u2019re seeing in Europe.\u201d What's trending for Sept. 10th, 2012 \"Regular folks\" 'testify' for candidates Do strong speeches convert into votes? Best Advice: Robert Gibbs Opinion: Three hurdles for Obama, Romney Romney also repeatedly tried to blame Obama for possible mandatory cuts in military spending at the end of the year under a budget deal passed last year by Congress with strong Republican support. \u201cThis sequestration idea emanated from the White House and it will result in the loss of thousands and thousands and hundreds of thousands of jobs across this country,\u201d Romney said. \u201cIt will be bad for employment if it goes forward. It will also be bad for our national security.\u201d While the rhetoric was similar to past criticism of Obama, Romney\u2019s tone sounded more urgent with less than two months until Election Day and the latest polls showing him stalled or even falling back. The new CNN/ORC poll released Monday showed that Obama received a four-percentage-point \u201cbounce\u201d from last week\u2019s Democratic convention, giving him a 52%-46% advantage over the former Massachusetts governor. After the Republican National Convention in late August, the same poll showed the candidates at 48% each. The sampling error means both results were statistically even, but the trend from the CNN survey and another one by Gallup showed Obama \u201cdid gain strength from his convention, principally by energizing the Democratic base,\u201d CNN Polling Director Keating Holland said. The Gallup daily tracking poll released Sunday showed Obama opening up his largest margin over Romney since early July \u2013 49% to 44% \u2013 which also was statistically even due to the margin of error. It was conducted September 2-8, a time window that included the entirety of the Democratic convention as well as a disappointing August jobs report that came out Friday. A week earlier, the same Gallup poll showed Obama with a 47%-46% advantage after the Republican convention. Romney campaign pollster Neil Newhouse advised against anyone getting \u201ctoo worked up about latest polling.\u201d \u201cWhile some voters will feel a bit of a sugar-high from the conventions, the basic structure of the race has not changed significantly,\u201d Newhouse wrote in the memo made public on Monday, adding that the nation\u2019s sluggish economic recovery remains the major issue and will \u201creassert itself as the ultimate downfall of the Obama presidency.\u201d The CNN/ORC poll also showed that Libertarian Party candidate Gary Johnson had the support of  3% of likely voters. It indicated Romney\u2019s support dropped by that amount with Johnson and Green Party candidate Jill Stein in the race, while Obama\u2019s support went down only one point. Spoiler alert: Poll finds small following for Libertarian candidate However, third-party candidates are typically not on the ballot in all 50 states, making it difficult to predict the impact of a Johnson candidacy on a nationwide basis. In more bad news for Romney, Obama\u2019s campaign announced Sunday it raised $114 million in August, topping the challenger\u2019s monthly haul for the first time since April. Romney is considered to still have the overall money advantage due to his superior fundraising the three previous months and a huge lead in private contributions to super-PACs supporting his candidacy. The Obama campaign refused to celebrate, warning in a Twitter post that Romney will have \u201can even bigger September.\u201d \u201cBut now we know we can match them, doing this our way,\u201d the Obama campaign\u2019s tweet said. In Ohio, Romney took shots at the Democratic convention platform that initially omitted the word \u201cGod\u201dbefore being changed on the floor, as well as the possibility of the congressionally mandated spending cuts in January. He noted that the budget agreement approved by Congress and signed into law by Obama last year requires the president to spell out what will happen if the mandatory cuts get activated by congressional failure to reach a deficit reduction compromise. \u201cI know it is an election year and so he hasn\u2019t been willing to do what the law, even the law he signed, required,\u201d Romney said of Obama. \u201cHe hasn\u2019t put out those cuts.  He won\u2019t describe all the jobs that are going to be lost.\u201d Attempting to link the issue to accusations of White House leaks of classified details of special forces operations, Romney added: \u201cIt seems we have found one secret related to national security that he is willing to keep.\u201d White House spokesman Jay Carney said Monday that the details of possible sequestration under the budget deal would be made public by the end of the week. Carney noted the mandated spending cuts \u2013 including the military \u2013 had been added to the agreement to motivate legislators to work out a deficit reduction compromise that would render them moot. Obama\u2019s goal in last year\u2019s tense negotiations on raising the debt ceiling was to prevent \u201ca default by the United States for the first time in its history on its obligations,\u201d Carney said, adding that it appeared then that House Republicans \u201cseemed to relish the prospect\u201d of such a default occurring. Carney also criticized congressional Republicans for what he called obstructionism that prevented progress on key issues such as deficit reduction. In particular, he labeled as politically obstinate the GOP refusal to consider letting any of the Bush-era tax cuts expires to raise more revenue as part of a deficit reduction plan. \u201cYou cannot stand on your maximalist position and just hold your breath,\u201d he told reporters at the White House, later adding \u201cthat was and continues to be the fundamental obstacle to putting in place a plan that would cut our deficits by $4 trillion and make huge progress in getting our fiscal house in order.\u201d Romney said Sunday on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press\u201d program that the debt ceiling agreement was a bad idea and Republicans should have opposed it. One of the congressional Republicans who backed the plan was Romney\u2019s running mate, conservative House Budget Chairman Paul Ryan of Wisconsin. Romney aims for the offensive The two campaigns also continued to battle over Medicare, the government-run health care system for senior citizens that is a key issue in Florida. Romney and Ryan say Obama has failed to offer a serious plan to address the structural issues that threaten Medicare insolvency as the U.S. population ages and health care costs continue to rise. Obama says Medicare reforms in the broader 2010 health care overhaul law extend the program\u2019s solvency, and he is willing to include further changes as part of a comprehensive deficit reduction agreement. Romney, who has made repealing the broader health care act a central campaign promise, made clear Sunday he would keep the more popular measures in the law, including allowing those under 26 years of age to remain on their parents\u2019 health care plans and guaranteeing coverage for people with pre-existing conditions. He has previously said he wanted to get rid of the Obamacare law despised by Republicans and replace it with something better, and his comments on \u201cMeet the Press\u201d showed his desire to stake out more flexible turf on the issue. \u201cThere are a number of things that I like in health care reform that I\u2019m going to put in place,\u201d Romney said. Romney and Ryan argue their plan would save Medicare in the long run by adding private sector competition. Democrats oppose any effort to change the basic concept of Medicare as a government-provided benefit, but have signaled willingness to raise the age of eligibility in the future and consider other reforms. Ryan, meanwhile, attempted to clarify the GOP ticket\u2019s deficit reduction plan on Sunday, saying he and Romney wanted to increase tax revenue by ending loopholes and deductions for the wealthy without raising rates. However, he refused to elaborate when pressed on the CBS program \u201cFace the Nation\u201d on which loopholes would get closed, saying those decisions should be made in a public debate. Romney\u2019s tax plan calls for 20% cuts to current income tax rates, which were lowered during the Bush administration that preceded Obama\u2019s presidency. Obama wants to extend the Bush-era tax cuts for all income below $250,000 for families and $200,000 for individuals as part of a deficit reduction package that he says would mean wealthier Americans return to higher tax rates of the 1990s.

            "article_content": "McCain and Rice took to stage to underscore GOP foreign policy Mike Huckabee, who once questioned Romney's Mormon faith, sang his praises Condoleezza Rice's speech won raves both in the forum and on Twitter On the night vice presidential candidate Paul Ryan made his debut on the national stage, the GOP turned its attention to America\u2019s influence abroad and what the party sees as President Barack Obama\u2019s failed economic policies. The roster of speakers at the Republican National Convention boasted two of the party\u2019s foreign policy heavy hitters and rhetoric designed to appeal to voters who are still undecided. Here are five things we learned from the convention\u2019s second night: 1. Romney\u2019s enforcer comes to play On Tuesday, the GOP convention was about love (Ann Romney) and respect (Chris Christie). But to the chagrin of head-scratching Republicans eager to take the fight to President Barack Obama, there wasn\u2019t much talk in the Tampa Bay Times Forum about the current administration in Washington. Paul Ryan put those anxieties to rest on Wednesday with a lengthy, aggressive and systematic attack on Obama\u2019s record in office, with one question as the thesis: \u201cWithout a change in leadership, why would the next four years be any different from the last four years?\u201d Ryan, criticized by Democrats as the architect of a budget plan that would gut Medicare, went on offense on the issue in the heart of retiree-heavy Florida. \u201cThe greatest threat to Medicare is Obamacare, and we are going to stop it,\u201d he said. Ryan: Let's get this done! Van Hollen on opening night RNC speeches Condoleezza Rice on minority voters McCain reflects on 2008 campaign There were also flashes of biography as the Wisconsin congressman tried to introduce himself to a country still learning about Mitt Romney\u2019s running mate. But it was clear from his sharpened rhetoric that the Romney campaign sent Ryan onstage to make the case against Obama. He described Obamacare as a cold \u201cpower play,\u201d condemned Solyndra as \u201ccronyism at its worst\u201d and said the president is \u201cforever shifting blame.\u201d Then there was this line, sure to be remembered for its trenchant appeal to younger voters who had hoped for more from Obama: \u201cCollege graduates should not have to live out their 20\u2019s in their childhood bedrooms, staring up at fading Obama posters and wondering when they can move out and get going with life.\u201d Responding in a statement, Obama spokeswoman Stephanie Cutter said Ryan \u201coffered Americans 40 minutes of vitriol and a half-dozen previously debunked attacks, but not one tangible idea to move this country forward.\u201d Ryan: White House leadership missing 2. On weak spots, let surrogates shine Republicans\u2019 nearly singular focus on the economy took a back seat Wednesday when Sen. John McCain and former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice took the stage to talk foreign policy, a topic Mitt Romney makes little mention of on the stump and that has been largely absent from the national political debate. Romney faces a solid foreign policy record from the current president, who voters consistently say in polls would better handle America\u2019s relationships with other countries if re-elected. In the latest CNN/ORC International survey released earlier this week, President Barack Obama had a 51%-44% advantage over Romney on foreign policy. Facing those facts, the Romney campaign chose Wednesday to use conservatives with well-established foreign policy credentials to make the case that Obama has failed a test of leadership in key international hot spots, including in Syria and Iran. \u201cUnfortunately, for four years, we\u2019ve drifted away from our proudest traditions of global leadership, traditions that are truly bipartisan,\u201d McCain said. \u201cWe\u2019ve let the challenges we face, both at home and abroad, become harder to solve. We can\u2019t afford to stay on that course any longer.\u201d Rice echoed many of the same themes. The former secretary of state said Romney and Ryan \u201cknow that our friends and allies must again be able to trust us,\u201d what she said was Obama\u2019s weakness on the international stage. Yet even Rice turned back to the economy, saying when the world looks at the United States, \u201cthey see an American government that cannot live within its means.\u201d Rice and McCain\u2019s remarks were a brief side track to a convention overwhelmingly focused on blaming Obama for the weak economy and how Romney plans to fix it. As Republican strategist and CNN contributor Alex Castellanos noted, neither campaign thinks foreign policy will make a big difference to voters struggling with high unemployment and stagnant wages. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to matter at the end,\u201d Castellanos said. \u201cBoth campaigns, I think, but especially the [Romney] campaign, wants to move on to the economy. And Barack Obama now has the experience, four years as commander-in-chief. So I put that is a plus for the Democrats in the fall.\u201d McCain: Can\u2019t have security threatened 3. Faith does matter Four years ago, as they were battling for the 2008 Republican presidential nomination, Mike Huckabee questioned Romney\u2019s Mormon faith. Four years later, as he addressed the Republican convention in prime time, the former Arkansas governor had a very different message. \u201cI care far less as to where Mitt Romney takes his family to church than I do about where he takes this country,\u201d said Huckabee, who still wields influence among social conservatives. Some in that key component of the Republican base still harbor suspicions of Romney \u2018s faith. While this convention is supposed to focus mostly on the economy, and while Huckabee did attack Obama over his handling of the issue, he did made the case for why social conservatives need to rally around their party\u2019s presidential nominee. \u201cLet me clear the air about whether guys like me would only support an evangelical. Of the four people on the two tickets, the only self-professed evangelical is Barack Obama, and he supports changing the definition of marriage, believes that human life is disposable and expendable at any time in the womb or even beyond the womb, and tells people of faith that they must bow their knees to the god of government and violate their faith and conscience in order to comply with what he calls health care,\u201d he said. Republican strategist John Branbender said that social conservatives are extremely committed to beating Obama. \u201cThe important thing Mitt Romney needs to do is moving them from being voters in November to being activists.\u201d \u201cAnd the difference is showing and voting and making phone calls, putting bumper stickers on their cars, and frankly that\u2019s where a Mike Huckabee, a Rick Santorum, and others, make it so vital, because they\u2019re out there on the front lines with social conservatives saying \u2018the war is now. This is the most important election in our lifetime. We have to win and we have to get active behind Mitt Romney.\u2019\u201d How faith will matter at the RNC 4. Condi Rice: A star Is born Romney advisers gave Condoleezza Rice rave reviews earlier this summer after she addressed a room of Republican donors and GOP officials at a closed-door campaign confab in Park City, Utah. On Wednesday, the country got a glimpse of the political skills and stage presence that may have prompted Romneyland to float Rice as a potential running mate in a buzzed-about leak to the Drudge Report in July. The former secretary of state under George W. Bush and current Stanford professor showed off her foreign policy acumen with a fluent (if somewhat predictable) defense of America\u2019s role in the world. \u201cMy fellow Americans, we do not have a choice,\u201d she said. \u201cWe cannot be reluctant to lead, and one cannot lead from behind. But it was Rice\u2019s tribute the American dream, the second half of her speech was laced with nods to her personal story and difficult upbringing in segregated Alabama, that had the convention crowd and political watchers mesmerized. \u201cAmerica has a way of making the impossible seem inevitable in retrospect,\u201d she said. \u201cBut of course it has never been inevitable. It has taken leadership, courage and an unwavering faith in our values.\u201d Her speech set Twitter alight. \u201cLump in throat,\u201d said Florida GOP operative Ryan Duffy. \u201cThe birth of a candidate,\u201d tweeted Roll Call editor David Drucker. \u201cA memorable speech,\u201d political analyst Stuart Rothenberg wrote. \u201cWow.\u201d Rice: America can\u2019t lead from behind 5. Romney and Ryan don\u2019t see iPod to iPod If you thought that Romney and his running mate are always on the same page, they\u2019re not. Ryan highlighted where the GOP ticket splits: on their playlists. The first member of Generation X on a presidential ticket pointed out one of the biggest differences in his vice presidential acceptance speech. \u201cWe\u2019re a full generation apart, Gov. Romney and I,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cAnd, in some ways, we\u2019re a little different. There are the songs on his iPod, which I\u2019ve heard on the campaign bus. And on many hotel elevators. He actually urged me to play some of these songs at campaign rallies. I said, I hope it\u2019s not a deal-breaker, Mitt, but my playlist starts with AC/DC and ends with Zeppelin,\u201d said Ryan. Ryan was obviously having some fun, but there\u2019s a serious side to his comments. By highlighting their differences over music, Ryan also emphasized his youth. It was accentuated by the 42-year-old congressman\u2019s wife and young children joining him on the stage following his speech. And that infusion of youth on a ticket headed by someone in his mid-60s could help. Ryan spoke the word \u201cgeneration\u201d a number of times in his address, at one point saying \u201cI accept the calling of my generation to give our children the America that was given to us, with opportunity for the young and security for the old, and I know that we are ready.\u201d With national and state polling indicating that Obama holds a large advantage among younger voters over Romney, Ryan can only help. \u201cWe\u2019ve got our first rock \u2018n\u2019 roll Republican on a national ticket. And that\u2019s something Mitt Romney lacked,\u201d Castellanos said. \u201cMitt Romney hadn\u2019t made the case yet about taking this campaign into the future. Obama\u2019s saying that Mitt Romney wants to go back. Paul Ryan is evidence that this party wants to move forward.\u201d \u2018Gen Xer\u2019 Paul Ryan takes up GOP torch, makes case to young voters",

            "article_content": "Many younger Republicans see Paul Ryan as a symbol of their generation Ryan will have to make the case to young voters that GOP policies are an asset Young Democrats say Ryan is too far right to represent young voters 'Gen Xers' seen as more fertile ground for Republicans than Millennials Paul Ryan symbolizes for many Republicans of his generation a passing of the torch and a call to embrace the Reagan-era principles that appealed so strongly to young voters in the 1980s. The Wisconsin congressman evoked both when he took the stage on Wednesday night and delivered a prime-time acceptance speech at the Republican National Convention that skewered what the GOP sees as President Barack Obama\u2019s failed economic policies. With Ryan, 42, holding down the No. 2 spot, the ticket hopes to strengthen his Generation X demographic ahead of November and broaden the campaign\u2019s appeal to a wealth of younger voters, a much more challenging prospect. During his speech, Ryan spoke directly to young voters\u2019 economic concerns. \u201cMillions of young Americans have graduated from college during the Obama presidency, ready to use their gifts and get moving in life.  Half of them can\u2019t find the work they studied for, or any work at all,\u201d Ryan told the crowd. \u201cSo here\u2019s the question: Without a change in leadership, why would the next four years be any different from the last four years?\u201d The first Gen Xers were eligible to vote for Ronald Reagan\u2019s second term at the height of his popularity and his conservative dogma. Younger voters for Reagan, the oldest U.S. president ever inaugurated, were among his strongest supporters. It was not known then that Reagan\u2019s political aura and his mantra for smaller government and lower taxes would endure well into the next century. Nostalgia for Reagan is powerful. His views remain a litmus test for Republicans seeking national office. Paul Ryan and Gen X GOP Generation X represents more fertile ground for Republicans in November than younger Millennials of Generation Y who overwhelmingly supported President Barack Obama four years ago. In Ryan, Gen X Republicans see similarities to Reagan and a changing of the guard. \u201cAs a fellow Gen Xer, I\u2019m excited about him and it says a lot,\u201d said Dylan Glenn, a former Bush administration economic policy analyst who has been friends with Ryan for nearly two decades. \u201cThere\u2019s a pent up demand that it\u2019s time for us and Paul represents the tip of that spear so to speak,\u201d Glenn said. Ryan formally pitched his personal story and his aggressive budgetary reform agenda in his address that highlighted his connection to post baby boom constituents. \u201cI accept the calling of my generation to give our children the America that was given to us, with opportunity for the young and security for the old \u2013 and I know that we are ready,\u201d  Ryan said in his address. Amy Holmes, anchor of GBTV\u2019s \u201cReal News\u201d at the Blaze, a conservative news site owned by Glenn Beck, said Ryan\u2019s Reagan-like sensibilities resonate with voters who came of age in the 1980s. \u201cAlex P. Keaton wasn\u2019t the anomaly. He was the norm,\u201d Holmes said, referring to the preppy, politically driven teen sitcom character played by Michael J. Fox. \u201cReagan is not some bogeyman for many Gen Xers.\u201d Ryan\u2019s fiscal outlook for streamlining budgets and overhauling the Medicare healthcare program for the elderly is typical of the thinking of Reagan-influenced conservative Gen Xers, said Soren Dayton, communications director for the Young Republican National Federation. \u201cThis is a guy who grew up in the context of Reagan\u2019s optimism\u201d that included the belief that private enterprise is crucial to addressing national issues, Dayton said. Young Republicans argue that Ryan\u2019s controversial \u201cPath to Prosperity\u201d entitlement reform plan, which proposes a partially privatized Medicare program, takes a cue from Generation X and Generation Y concerns that those benefits will not be there for them. They also point to high unemployment for younger Americans as another factor that could push more younger voters into the arms of Romney and Ryan in November. Ryan tapped into that frustration during his speech. \u201cCollege graduates should not have to live out their 20s in their childhood bedrooms, staring up at fading Obama posters and wondering when they can move out and get going with life,\u201d Ryan said to applause. \u201cEveryone who feels stuck in the Obama economy is right to focus on the here and now.  And I hope you understand this too, if you\u2019re feeling left out or passed by: You have not failed, your leaders have failed you,\u201d he said. Young Democrats say Ryan\u2019s deeply conservative views diverge from many of his generation and may not appeal to younger voters either. \u201cHe\u2019s really somebody who has taken positions that are way, way to the right of where most millennial voters are,\u201d said Sam Spencer, president of the Young Democrats of North Carolina and a delegate to next week\u2019s Democratic National Convention. During the 2008 election, Obama won Millennial voters under the age of 30 by 66% to 32%, according to exit polls. A recent CNN/ORC International poll of registered voters found Obama with a  56% to 37% lead among that same demographic. The Generation X vote was closer last time with Obama outpacing McCain by just 6 points, according to exit polling cited by the Pew Research Center. Paul Ryan\u2019s Gen X sensibilities an asset But on Wednesday night it was clear that Ryan and the Republican party hope to turn those numbers around. \u201cWe\u2019re a full generation apart, Governor Romney and I.  And, in some ways, we\u2019re a little different.  There are the songs on his iPod, which I\u2019ve heard on the campaign bus and on many hotel elevators,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cHe actually urged me to play some of these songs at campaign rallies.  I said, I hope it\u2019s not a deal-breaker Mitt, but my playlist starts with AC/DC, and ends with Zeppelin.\u201d CNN\u2019s Tom Cohen contributed to this report",

            "article_content": "Romney activist: election not about independents but about the party base This election is like 2004 where George Bush \"was as much of a lightning rod as President Obama is today\" CNN Pollster: It all gets down to grassroots Democrat: Election is about looking at the progress made and then realizing that progress could be rolled back In most presidential races this close, it is a battle for the undecideds and independents. Pre-convention interviews with both Republican and Democratic delegates suggest this year might be more like trench warfare \u2013 firing up the party faithful, starting in Tampa and Charlotte, to mobilize a high grassroots voter turnout in November. \u201cConventional wisdom is that this election is about independents, but in reality it\u2019s about the base,\u201d said Orit Sklar, a Georgia-based longtime Romney activist attending her first convention as part of a state delegation. \u201cFor Republicans, it means the convention is that much more important this time around. Our base has to be energized leaving Tampa, because we have to do everything we can not only to elect Mitt Romney, but to win the Senate and gain greater control of the House.\u201d L.A. mayor: Will be very close election Obama, Romney locked in a tight race Rebutting the GOP message Look inside Romney's views as governor Like President Barack Obama, Philadelphia City Councilman Kenyatta Johnson launched his political career as an inner-city community activist. He says the mission is no different for Democrats. \u201cI\u2019m a grassroots organizer at heart. \u2026 You\u2019ve got to make sure you get everyone at every level involved, all pushing the same message,\u201d he said. \u201cWe want to make sure we go block by block, house by house, door by door, to make sure we get every vote possible.\u201d Paul loyalists say \u2018we can do better\u2019 That view is echoed by Georgia Democratic delegate Steve Henson, minority leader of the state Senate. \u201cYou better be on your p\u2019s and q\u2019s on Election Day and make sure your people are coming,\u201d he said. \u201cTurnout\u2019s a concern in every state for both parties.  You\u2019ve got to get your people to the polls.\u201d Republicans liken this year\u2019s race to 1980 when the contrasts between the two candidates \u2013 Ronald Reagan and then-President Jimmy Carter \u2013 were just as stark. Obama, Romney: No more niceness But some analysts say the more apt comparison is 2004 when the incumbent, Republican George W. Bush, \u201cwas as much of a lightning rod as President Obama is today,\u201d as chief CNN pollster Keating Holland put it. \u201cThis is not an election where you are trying to persuade independents,\u201d Holland said. \u201cThe selection of Paul Ryan is evidence of this. \u2026 The Ryan pick was a base election strategy.\u201d Ryan\u2019s selection was heartily applauded by Debbie Dooley, the Atlanta-based national coordinator of Tea Party Patriots. \u201cI didn\u2019t think Romney would be bold or courageous enough to pick Paul Ryan as his running mate,\u201d she said. \u201cThat signals the direction he\u2019s going in. He\u2019s not trying to run away from some of the statements Paul Ryan has made in regards to Medicare and some of the other issues.\u201d Before Romney picked Ryan, some conservatives seemed to be more anti-Obama than pro-Romney.  A similar situation existed in 2004, with Republicans occupying the White House. \u201cWith all respect to John Kerry, the party was united against Bush,\u201d recalled Michigan Democratic Chairman Mark Brewer, who is going to his sixth convention, this time as a so-called \u201csuper-delegate.\u201d \u201cHe ran as a compassionate conservative in 2000.  That went out the door with tax cuts for the rich and two wars he paid for with credit cards.\u201d Opinion: What GOP needs to do in Tampa Kentucky GOP delegate Mark Metcalf is a U.S. Army reservist who served in Iraq after working in the Bush Justice Department and later at the Pentagon as associate deputy general counsel. Metcalf went to his first convention in 1980, as chairman of Kentucky\u2019s Young Republicans and a supporter of dark horse presidential candidate Howard Baker, the senator from Tennessee who achieved fame by asking \u201cWhat did the president know, and when did he know it?\u201d during the Watergate scandal that brought down Richard Nixon. \u201cIt was a convention I went to believing in a man who really didn\u2019t get very far in the presidential race, and I left as an advocate for Ronald Reagan,\u201d he says. Of this year\u2019s contest, Metcalf says: \u201cIn my lifetime, I think this is probably the most important presidential election we\u2019ve ever had. There\u2019s two very different visions of America offered by Governor Romney and President Obama. What\u2019s at stake is the free enterprise system as it has been articulated during the history of this country. \u201cPresident Obama stands for more government, less freedom and less personal responsibility. Governor Romney stands for free enterprise, less government, more freedom.\u201d Two Democratic delegates from Florida stressed the importance of Obama\u2019s appeal to minorities and young people, voter blocs that were pivotal for him four years ago. \u201cI think the outcome of the election may very well be determined by the number of young people who come out to vote,\u201d said Stephanie Rosendorf, 21, director of political affairs for Florida College Democrats, a first-time voter herself in 2008. \u201cI think we can either choose to re-elect our president and continue to make progress or we can go back to the last decade and its failed policies.\u201d Annette Taddeo, a Colombian-American small business owner, ran for Congress on the ticket with Obama in 2008 but lost to popular Cuban-born Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen in south Florida. A longtime party activist, she was cheered by Obama\u2019s decision to exempt from deportation children of illegal immigrants who pursue a college education, his endorsement of same-sex marriage and the party\u2019s proposed platform plank embracing that position. Of Obama\u2019s runs for the presidency, Taddeo says, \u201cThe first time it was historic; this time it\u2019s personal because the attacks have been so personal \u2013 frankly, below the belt \u2013 throughout his presidency.  It\u2019s unacceptable. \u201cObamacare wasn\u2019t good enough even though it\u2019s the same as Romneycare just because it came from his mouth.\u201d Dooley, who stresses fiscal conservatism over social issues, says tea party get-out-the-vote efforts are focused on Senate, congressional and local contests. \u201cIf we get people out for those races, those people are going to vote for Romney,\u201d she says. \u201cWe feel Georgia is a red state so the Tea Party Patriots and Atlanta Tea Party are sending people to Florida, maybe Virginia, some of the other battleground states, to help there.\u201d Holland, the CNN pollster, says it all gets down to the grassroots. \u201cThe Republican conventional wisdom is the Obama coalition from 2008 was a coalition of people who are known for not voting,\u201d he said.  \u201cSo they believe if they motivate their base and Obama tries to mobilize his base, he will fall short.\u201d Brewer, the Michigan Democratic chairman, disagrees with that scenario. \u201cI think there really is respect and affection for the president for all the things he\u2019s done under the circumstances,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd then we look at the alternative \u2013 Romney and the tea party Republicans and all the things they would roll back, overturn and repeal.\u201d",

            "article_content": "NEW: Paul Ryan says Medicare will be a winning issue for Republicans President Obama's team keeps the focus on Mitt Romney's tax returns A new Obama ad rebuts Romney attacks on Medicare Analyst: Too soon to say if Ryan's stance on Medicare will hurt Romney Paul Ryan assured Republicans on Friday that they had the chance to turn America around from the failed policies of President Barack Obama if they elect Mitt Romney to the White House in November. In two campaign speeches in the battleground state of Virginia, the House Budget Committee Chairman chosen last week as Romney\u2019s running mate offered a conservative blueprint for progress, promising leadership that tackles tough challenges such as the rising federal deficit and debt. \u201cThis is our generation\u2019s defining moment,\u201d Ryan told a boisterous crowd in Glen Allen, near Richmond. \u201cThis is the most important election in your lifetime, no matter what generation you come from,\u201d he shouted to conclude his remarks. \u201cWe can do this. We can turn this around. We can get this right. We can get our economy growing. We can get people back to work. We can look back on this moment as the moment we secured the future for our children and our grandchildren.\u201d Earlier, Obama\u2019s team grabbed the attention on a relatively quiet campaign day with moves that spotlighted the tax returns and Medicare proposal of certain Republican challenger Romney. With neither presidential candidate making any public appearances, their advisers and surrogates kept up attacks in the contentious battle to frame the major issues in their side\u2019s favor less than three months before the election. Obama\u2019s campaign manager, Jim Messina, fired the first shot by making public a letter to his counterpart in the Romney camp that offered a \u201cdeal\u201d in which the former Massachusetts governor would release five more years of past tax filings in return for Democrats agreeing to drop the issue. \u201cIf the governor will release five years of returns, I commit in turn that we will not criticize him for not releasing more \u2013 neither in ads nor in other public communications or commentary for the rest of the campaign,\u201d Messina\u2019s letter to Romney campaign manager Matt Rhoades said. His offer did not include a promise to avoid attacking Romney on the contents of the released returns, or make any commitments for independent third party groups. Rhoades rejected the offer. \u201cIt is clear that President Obama wants nothing more than to talk about Governor Romney\u2019s tax returns instead of the issues that matter to voters, like putting Americans back to work, fixing the economy and reining in spending,\u201d Rhoades wrote in response to Messina. Romney has released his return for 2010 and an estimate for 2011. He has pledged to release the full 2011 return once it is completed by his accountant, which must occur by October 15 under the extension he filed with the Internal Revenue Service in April. Democrats criticize Romney for not releasing more tax details, arguing that voters are entitled to a greater amount of disclosure from candidates running for president. At the White House on Friday, Deputy Press Secretary Josh Earnest responded to repeated questions on the issue by noting previous presidential candidates released as many as 12 years of tax returns under a precedent set by Romney\u2019s father, former Michigan Gov. George Romney, in his unsuccessful presidential bid. \u201cAll the questions you are asking could be answered before the end of the day today, but that will require Governor Romney to live up to a standard that\u2019s been met by every other major-party presidential candidate since his father ran for president in 1968,\u201d Earnest said. Some Republicans also have called on Romney to release more of his returns, saying the political headache could be easily ended by simply putting out additional information. Romney and his campaign have consistently rebuffed such calls, saying the two years released so far go beyond the legal requirement and offer voters a good perspective into the candidate\u2019s financial background. They also say Democrats will launch unfair attacks on any further tax information released by Romney, who is a multimillionaire. Questioned again Thursday about his tax returns, Romney revealed more details than he had previously, telling reporters that he paid no less that 13% of his income in taxes for the past decade while reiterating his refusal to make those returns public. That did not satisfy Obama\u2019s senior campaign adviser, David Axelrod. \u201cI don\u2019t accept his word on what his taxes say,\u201d Axelrod told CNN on Thursday night. \u201cLet the public see it. Let them understand what\u2019s in those tax returns. They say, \u2018well, we don\u2019t want to do it because the opposition may make issues about it.\u2019 Well, that doesn\u2019t give me much confidence about what\u2019s in those tax returns.\u201d Republican Rep. Jason Chaffetz of Utah, a Romney surrogate, told CNN on Friday that the tax return issue was \u201ca sidebar attempt to distract from the real issues that are out there.\u201d \u201cThey did two years required by law and they did four years that was done as the governor of Massachusetts, so I think it\u2019s kind of a side issue that\u2019s just crazy,\u201d Chaffetz said. A CNN/ORC Poll taken August 7-8 showed 63% of voters thought Romney should release additional years of tax returns. Among independents, 67% said the Republican candidate should release more years of returns. Meanwhile, the Obama campaign released a new television advertisement on Medicare intended to rebut the Romney campaign\u2019s attacks on the issue this week, particularly a claim discounted by independent sources that Obama\u2019s health care reform cuts $716 billion from the government health care program for senior citizens. In the ad titled \u201cFacts,\u201d the Obama campaign quotes AARP, an advocacy group for senior citizens, as saying Obama\u2019s health care reforms passed in 2010 crack down on Medicare fraud, waste and abuse while strengthening guaranteed benefits. It also challenges the proposal by Ryan to partially privatize Medicare for people currently younger than 55, saying that could result in higher costs for retirees. At his second Virginia event in Springfield near Washington, Ryan welcomed the debate on the politically sensitive entitlement program. He described Obama\u2019s cuts as treating Medicare \u201clike a piggy bank\u201d to pay for his health care reform bill that Republicans want to repeal. \u201cWe want this debate on Medicare,\u201d Ryan said, calling it a winning issue for Republicans. Romney campaign spokeswoman Andrea Saul earlier said the president\u2019s Medicare cuts included money for enhanced coverage called Medicare Advantage, and that the program will run out of money in 2024 under Obama\u2019s reforms. At the White House, Earnest noted that the Obama reforms in the 2010 Affordable Care Act extended the solvency of Medicare for eight years, while the pledge by Romney to repeal the law known by critics as \u201cObamacare\u201d would leave the program to go broke by 2016. The Medicare issue became a major campaign topic last week when Romney chose Ryan as his running mate. Knowing the Obama team would raise the politically sensitive Medicare issue, Romney\u2019s campaign attacked first in an attempt to blunt a perceived advantage for Democrats. It was unclear how the debate would impact the election, especially in states like Florida that have large populations of senior citizens, said CNN senior political analyst David Gergen. \u201cThat\u2019s what gives suspense to this campaign,\u201d Gergen said Thursday night. Any candidate who calls for Medicare reforms that could take away existing benefits is \u201cgoing to pay a price, and there are some polls coming out of Florida now suggesting Obama has been helped by the Ryan selection,\u201d he added. The issue might be causing a divide between different age groups, according to Gergen. \u201cWhat I also found interesting in the CNN poll in Wisconsin is that among 65 and older, Romney has a substantial lead over President Obama,\u201d he said. \u201cBut with the crowd from 50 to 64, it\u2019s Obama who has a substantial lead. There\u2019s a 14-point swing from the 65-year-old types. And it\u2019s the 50 to 64-year-old folks who could be affected by Medicare reform.\u201d In his speeches on Friday, Ryan accused Obama of hindering small business growth through what Republicans contend are excessive regulations and high taxes. \u201cWe should not have a government that stands in the way, that erects barriers to small business,\u201d Ryan said, calling the opportunity to build an idea into a successful business the essence of \u201cwhat it is to be an American.\u201d \u201cYou see, when another American succeeds that\u2019s not a bad thing,\u201d Ryan added. \u201cIt\u2019s a good thing.  We take pride in their success.  We don\u2019t resent success.\u201d The Romney campaign said Friday it received more than $10 million in online donations since the August 11 announcement of Ryan as running mate.

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: The 2012 presidential race is CNN Chief National Correspondent John King\u2019s seventh campaign. King is traveling through battleground states, where the election will be decided, to find the voters who will determine whether President Barack Obama gets a second term or if the country needs the change in direction that Mitt Romney represents. President Obama won Iowa in a 10-point blowout in 2008; this year it could go either way Democrats enjoyed a numbers advantage in 2008, this year there is parity Iowa's Republican governor says people feel betrayed by Obama Obama strategist David Axelrod says the campaign won't be \"outhustled\" in Iowa A visit to the Iowa State Fair is a test of diet discipline: They fry just about everything \u2013 from Oreos to butter to mac & cheese \u2013 and the bigger the better, from half-pound tenderloins to massive turkey legs and pork chops. Not much changes from year to year. There\u2019s the butter cow, nightly entertainment at the grandstand, arcade games and amusement rides. But the \u201cCast Your Kernel\u201d booth, while hardly a scientific enterprise, offers a big hint of change from the last presidential year: With more than 30,000 kernels cast, Mitt Romney is leading President Barack Obama.Iowa, the scene of a 10-point Obama blowout in 2008, is a 2012 presidential battleground. Obama stopped by the fair during his three-day Iowa bus tour this week. And the Romney campaign chose the fair for the solo debut of Rep. Paul Ryan, the GOP vice presidential pick. \u201cWe have a real battle going on here for the heart and soul of the people of this state,\u201d GOP Gov. Terry Branstad says during an early afternoon walk through the fairgrounds. \u201cPresident Obama had a tremendous following here four years ago,\u201d Branstad says in making the GOP\u2019s case. \u201cBut people feel betrayed. They feel like he ran as someone who was going to bring people together and reach across the aisle and he hasn\u2019t done that.\u201d Branstad is both a throwback and part of an Iowa Republican revival: He was governor for 16 years, left office, and then decided to run again in 2010, when the Midwest was a big part of the midterm GOP rout. Battlegrounds: No Iowa blowout in 2012 Battlegrounds: The power of Ohio Battlegrounds: African-American turnout Four years ago, Democrats enjoyed a significant numbers advantage in Iowa. Now, there is parity \u2013 even a slight GOP edge in the latest active voter registration tally. \u201cHave you been outhustled here?\u201d is the question we put to top Obama political strategist David Axelrod as he traveled with the president this week. Axelrod was quick to offer a tip of the cap to Branstad and the Iowa Republican Party for their aggressive work the past few years, but he voiced confidence the Obama campaign was stepping up its grass-roots organizing. \u201cI think we still have an organizational advantage in this state,\u201d Axelrod says. \u201cWe\u2019ve done a good job of registering new voters so I think we are building that back up. But I don\u2019t think we are going to be outhustled on Election Day.\u201d The urgency is obvious when you stop by a local Obama campaign office. In Davenport this week, for example, everyone in line for tickets to one of the president\u2019s rallies was asked if they were registered voters. Those who said no were immediately handed a clipboard with the registration form, and volunteers \u2013 knowing anyone not registered by now might be unreliable come Election Day \u2013 suggested they also sign up to vote by mail, which allows the campaign to follow-up and witness the process. You don\u2019t need to visit the fair or a campaign office to understand 2012 is different from 2008. Just turn on the television. The TV ad war is bruising, and unavoidable \u2013 $6 million spent just in Iowa in the last month. The Obama campaign outspent the Romney campaign more than 2-1 in the past month in Iowa. But the TV ad war scales tip back in favor of Romney and the GOP when spending by the political parties and super PACs is factored in. Iowa is a great test of the Ryan Factor. The president\u2019s team says his policy views \u2013 on Medicare, on a new long-term farm bill and on renewable energy subsidies \u2013 will in the end trump any short-term bounce from his campaign skills and Midwest roots. \u201cHe may hail from Wisconsin,\u201d Axelrod says in the interview, \u201cbut he is very much a product of the right-wing Washington think tanks. And that vision is not a good vision for this country.\u201d Branstad, in turn, calls the Ryan pick \u201cbrilliant\u201d and, a Catholic himself, predicts having a Catholic as the No. 2 on the GOP ticket will help with a critical voting bloc here, especially in the Northeast corner of the state. Plus, Branstad says Iowa voters rank the federal deficit higher than jobs as an election priority \u2013 and says Ryan is in tune with their worries about annual deficits and long-term debt. \u201cYou cannot increase the deficit, the debt, a trillion dollars every year and have 40 cents of every dollar you spend be borrowed money,\u201d Branstad says. Branstad also says he is confident of what you might call a reverse-coattails effect: He says Republicans are competitive in each of the state\u2019s congressional districts this year, and suggests that will help with the presidential margins in traditionally Democratic areas like Des Moines and surrounding Polk County. Democrats take a not-so-fast approach to that dynamic \u2013 promising to make the Ryan budget, particularly its Medicare proposals, an issue in every House race here and beyond. Branstad acknowledged the potential power of the issue, especially in an older state like Iowa, but predicted it would not hurt the GOP provided Romney and Ryan used every opportunity to rebut the attacks and explain their proposals. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be close,\u201d Branstad says of the state, making note of the heavy commitment of candidate time, staff and spending both campaigns are making to Iowa. That includes busy booths just a few steps away from each other at the fair, where both campaigns are helping to register voters and recruit volunteers. Branstad, whose involvement in presidential politics goes back more than a quarter-century, smiles at all the activity \u2013 and attention. \u201cIt\u2019s fun,\u201d the governor says, \u201cto be a battleground state.\u201d Axelrod, who also traveled with Vice President Joe Biden the last time he came to Iowa, says the state and its six electoral votes could prove decisive. \u201cJohn, my philosophy is always to plan for the worst and hope for the best,\u201d Axelrod says. \u201cAnd so we\u2019re planning for 270 electoral votes (the minimum for victory).  In that scenario, even a smaller state like Iowa can be a pivotal state.  And that\u2019s why we\u2019re spending three days here.  We\u2019re not leaving anything to chance.  We\u2019re fighting for every vote and every electoral vote.  And these electoral votes matter.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Romney campaigns in Ohio, calls Biden's Wall Street remark outrageous A new Romney ad takes on President Obama on Medicare Obama promotes wind energy in Iowa President Barack Obama and Mitt Romney battled over Medicare and energy policy Tuesday as the November election campaign reached out to battleground states crucial to both sides\u2019 chances for victory. In an escalating struggle to seize the advantage on the contentious Medicare issue, the Romney campaign counterpunched with a new ad accusing Obama of cutting more than $700 billion from the government-run health care plan for senior citizens. Romney made the same claim at two Ohio campaign appearances, three days after his selection of House Budget Chairman Paul Ryan brought the issue to the forefront of the campaign spotlight. Ryan is best-known for a conservative budget plan passed by the U.S. House that includes reforms to partially privatize Medicare, which Democrats say will kill the popular entitlement program. Biden responds to 'chains' criticism Ryan defends Romney's business record Obama jokes about Romney's dog Romney digs at Obama's 'war on coal' To counter consistent Democratic attacks in recent days against Ryan\u2019s Medicare proposals, the new Romney ad sought to turn the tables by contending the money senior citizens have paid into Medicare for years will instead fund Obama\u2019s 2010 health care reform bill. At a campaign event Tuesday in Ohio, Romney beat the same drum. Follow along on the CNN electoral map \u201cWhen he ran for office he said he\u2019d protect Medicare, but did you know that he has taken $716 billion out of the Medicare trust fund \u2013 he\u2019s raided that trust fund \u2013 and you know what he did with it?\u201d Romney said of Obama. \u201cHe\u2019s used it to pay for Obamacare \u2013 a risky, unproven, federal government takeover of health care \u2013 and if I\u2019m president of the United States we\u2019re putting the $716 billion back.\u201d A July 24 Congressional Budget Office report said that repealing the health care law, as called for by Romney and Ryan, would increase spending on Medicare by  $716 billion through 2022. At the same time, the CBO letter said keeping Obamacare in place would not mean a $716 billion decrease in Medicare spending as claimed by Romney and his ad. The Obama campaign called Romney\u2019s claim \u201cdishonest and \u201chypocritical.\u201d \u201cThe savings his ad attacks do not cut a single guaranteed Medicare benefit, and Mitt Romney embraced the very same savings when he promised he\u2019d sign Paul Ryan\u2019s budget,\u201d said Obama campaign spokeswoman Lis Smith. David Axelrod, Obama\u2019s senior campaign adviser, told CNN earlier Tuesday that Medicare reforms in the president\u2019s health care law \u201ctook away subsidies, unwarranted subsidies, to insurance companies, and he used that money to help lengthen the life of Medicare by nearly a decade.\u201d Dueling appearances by the presidential contenders and their running mates hit states considered up for grabs in November \u2013 Iowa, Ohio, Colorado, Nevada and Virginia. Standing in front of helmeted Ohio coal workers, Romney promised American energy independence by 2020 if he is elected to two terms, saying he will promote full development of the nation\u2019s oil, coal and natural gas reserves. He accused Obama of opposing coal energy production as part of a policy that favors energy sources \u201cthat come from above the ground\u201d \u2013 such as wind and solar energy \u2013 instead of those from below the ground. Since taking office in 2009, Obama has called for a comprehensive energy strategy that includes development of cleaner alternative sources such as wind and solar energy. Republican critics contend the administration uses environmental regulations and other means to hinder development of fossil fuel energy resources such as oil and coal. Paul Ryan\u2019s Gen X sensibilities an asset? \u201cHe also said you can go out and build a new coal plant if you want, but you\u2019ll go bankrupt. That\u2019s what he said,\u201d Romney told the applauding crowd. Speaking at the same time as Romney, Obama told a campaign event in Oskaloosa, Iowa, that Romney would not support the wind energy industry developing in the state. \u201cGov. Romney said let\u2019s end the tax credits for wind energy production, let\u2019s get rid of them. He said that new sources of energy like wind are imaginary,\u201d Obama said. The president cited a thriving wind energy industry in the state, noting it supports nearly 7,000 Iowa jobs. \u201cIf he knew what you\u2019ve been doing, he\u2019d know that about 20% of Iowa\u2019s electricity now comes from wind, powering our homes and our factories and our businesses in a way that\u2019s clean and renewable,\u201d Obama said, later calling for a halt to billions of dollars in tax subsidies to oil companies making \u201chuge profits\u201d and instead investing in \u201cthe new homegrown energy that\u2019s creating jobs here in Iowa.\u201d Overall, though, the campaign focus remained on Ryan and his budget plan passed by House Republicans that calls for sharp cuts in non-military spending to shrink government as well as stark reforms to the Medicare and Medicaid entitlement programs that provide health care to senior citizens, the poor and the disabled. Ryan\u2019s proposals include the provision that Medicare-approved private insurers would one day compete with traditional Medicare on an exchange. The intention of his plan is to remake Medicare so that it remains financially soluble for future generations, while preserving the benefits of current seniors and those who will qualify in the next 10 years, he told CBS on Sunday. Ryan, campaigning in Colorado, made no specific mention of his Medicare reform plans, instead emphasizing his \u201cregular guy\u201d interests, such as bow-hunting, and promising to restore opportunity for those willing to work for it. \u201cWhen I was growing up, you know when I was flipping burgers at McDonalds, when I was standing in front of that big Hobart machine washing dishes or waiting tables, I never thought of myself as stuck in some station in life,\u201d Ryan told more 2,000 supporters at Lakewood High School in suburban Denver. \u201cI thought to myself: I\u2019m the American dream.\u201d A contrast in Catholic politics Later Tuesday, Ryan attended an event at GOP bankroller Sheldon Adelson\u2019s Las Vegas hotel. Across the country, Vice President Joe Biden held two events in Virginia, where he challenged the policies of  Romney and Ryan. \u201cLook at what they value and look at their budget and what they are proposing,\u201d Biden said at his first stop, in Danville. He accused Romney of promising to lift regulations on big banks that would \u201cunchain Wall Street,\u201d adding: \u201cHe is going to put y\u2019all back in chains.\u201d At an event Tuesday evening in Chillicothe, Ohio, Romney attacked Obama and his surrogates, saying they have made \u201cwild and reckless accusations that disgrace the office of the presidency.\u201d He pointed to Biden\u2019s remark, calling it an outrageous charge. \u201cAnd the White House sinks a little bit lower,\u201d he said.  \u201cThis is what an angry and desperate presidency looks like.\u201d An Obama campaign spokeswoman said earlier the president had no problem with Biden\u2019s statement. \u201cWe find the Romney campaign\u2019s outrage over the vice president\u2019s comments today hypocritical, particularly in light of their own candidate\u2019s stump speech questioning the president\u2019s patriotism,\u201d said a statement by Stephanie Cutter of the Obama campaign. Republicans reject the Democratic tactic to tie Romney to the Ryan proposal, saying the former Massachusetts governor has his own budget and tax plans that are similar to Ryan\u2019s but also include key differences, such as protecting anyone over 55 from changes to Medicare. \u201cThe budget plan, the approach on Medicare and all of that is going to be the Romney plan,\u201d senior Romney campaign adviser John Sununu told CNN Tuesday. Pressed for details in a combative interview on \u201cStarting Point with Soledad O\u2019Brien,\u201d Sununu said Romney \u201clikes the Ryan plan for its guts,\u201d but added \u201che has his own plan out there, which is carefully crafted to protect the seniors from 55 and up.\u201d By contrast, Sununu added, the Republican plans are more comprehensive and detailed than proposals by Obama and Democrats that fail to seriously address the nation\u2019s deficit-debt problem. The focus of the debate on Ryan\u2019s budget plan and Medicare means Democrats are winning the early message war, said Erick Erickson of the conservative website RedState.com. Romney\u2019s choice of Ryan means the campaign, for now, \u201cis no longer a referendum on the president,\u201d which has been the central GOP strategy, said Erickson, a CNN contributor. \u201cIt\u2019s a choice between two visions. And a lot of Republican strategists don\u2019t have confidence that the Romney campaign is able to sell their choice,\u201d Erickson said Monday night. In addition, Erickson noted, the main topic now is Medicare and \u201cRepublicans don\u2019t necessarily win when you talk about Medicare.\u201d Campaign 2012: How low can you go?

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: The 2012 presidential race is John King\u2019s seventh campaign. Scheduling conflicts prevented Wisconsin Congressman Paul Ryan from sitting down to an interview for this story. Ryan has already gone toe-to-toe with Obama over spending growth Ryan is a \"bold choice,\" says CNN analyst David Gergen Former colleagues think Ryan would help in Wisconsin and across the Midwest While Ryan would energize conservative base, he has little experience outside the House For Paul Ryan, debating Joe Biden might feel like a bit of a demotion. He has, after all, been at the center of the budget debate with President Barack Obama and the entire Democratic Party for several years now, including some memorable, direct exchanges with the president. Recall, for example, their early 2010 faceoff when the president decided to attend the House Republican retreat in Baltimore. When Ryan rose with a question, the president playfully acknowledged the congressman\u2019s \u201ccrew\u201d \u2013 his wife and children. Where can Ryan help Romney? Blackburn on 'caliber' of VP candidates Romney running mate rumors Rep. Ryan on GOP primary & social issues But then they got down to business, with Ryan, then still in a Republican minority, criticizing the rate of spending growth. \u201cSo my question is,\u201d Ryan asked the president, \u201cWhy not start freezing spending now, and would you support a line item veto in helping us get a vote on it in the House?\u201d Obama: \u201cLet me respond to the two specific questions, but I want to just push back a little bit on the underlying premise about us increasing spending by 84%.\u201d Exclusive: How Romney chose his running mate The president went on for a bit, but when Ryan regained the floor, he did not back down: \u201cThe discretionary spending, the bills that Congress signs that you sign into law, has increased 84%.\u201d The president, clearly not happy, shut it down: \u201cWe\u2019ll have a longer debate on the budget numbers, all right?\u201d Ryan is the GOP\u2019s numbers guy, and since their sweeping 2010 midterm election victory, the House Budget Committee chairman is eager to make the case that the only way back to fiscal sanity is significant spending reductions and a sweeping overhaul of Medicare. His most recent budget plan would curb growing deficits by slashing domestic programs and lowering tax rates for individuals and businesses. The Medicare eligibility age would rise from 65 to 67 and spending would be capped. Seniors could stay in the current fee-for-service model or opt to receive government assistance to purchase private health insurance plans. House passes GOP budget In a 2011 interview with CNN, Ryan made the case that, as difficult as the choices are, both the generational and budget math are on his side. \u201cIf we don\u2019t address these issues now, they are going to steamroll us as a country,\u201d Ryan told CNN. \u201cThe more you delay fixing these problems, the much uglier the solutions are going to be.\u201d In short, Ryan is a lightning rod, and Mitt Romney\u2019s choosing him as to share the GOP ticket fundamentally changes the 2012 race. Wall Street Journal pushes Ryan for veep \u201cIt would be a bold choice,\u201d CNN senior analyst David Gergen said of a Romney-Ryan ticket before Saturday\u2019s announcement. \u201cIt would be a risky choice,\u201d he quickly added. Gergen, who has advised four U.S. presidents and closely tracked Romney\u2019s political career, said a Ryan pick seemed counter to Romney\u2019s political DNA. \u201cIt\u2019s hard for me to see Mitt Romney, who has played it safe all the way through the campaign, making that kind of gamble.\u201d But there are upsides: \u2022 It would energize a GOP base often suspicious of Romney. \u2022 Ryan is an energetic debater and campaigner. \u2022 At just 42, he would add youthful vigor to the race. Close friends like former House colleague Mark Green are adamant Ryan would help in Wisconsin and across the Midwest. \u201cI think he does get Wisconsin,\u201d Green told CNN in an interview this week. \u201cBut I think more importantly he gets that sort of blue-collar conservatism that I think is at the heart of the Republican Party.\u201d So why is tapping Ryan such a gamble? First and foremost because of the House GOP budget that bears his name. Romney for months has tried to frame the race as a referendum on the first Obama term, specifically the president\u2019s economic record. CNN Running Mate Poll: Who are these guys? Adding Ryan to the ticket could mean no escaping an onslaught of Democratic criticism that the Republican ticket would, as Sen. Chuck Schumer of New York is fond of putting it, \u201cend Medicare as we know it.\u201d One ad critical of the Ryan budget showed a man pushing an elderly woman in a wheelchair off a cliff, and ended with the tagline: \u201cIs America beautiful without Medicare? Ask Paul Ryan and his friends in Congress.\u201d Ryan calls the attacks demagoguery and says Obama has failed to put forward serious proposals to reform costly entitlement programs. This is the \u201cbold\u201d debate conservatives pushing Ryan want, but other Republicans worry it could steer the campaign focus away from the president and onto GOP proposals. Other potential downsides: \u2022 Ryan is a House member popular in what was once considered a competitive swing district, but he has never run statewide. \u2022 He has no foreign policy experience. \u2022 Some, perhaps especially after the Sarah Palin 2008 pick, will question whether a 42-year-old House member is ready to be commander-in-chief. \u201cHe is without question one of the stars of the Republican future over the next 10 to 20 years,\u201d Gergen said. \u201cWhether he is ready at this moment, only the campaign trail could tell, and he\u2019s going to get, I\u2019ll tell you, he is going to take a real beating.\u201d Ryan is a fitness freak, frequently leading Hill colleagues in grueling cross-training sessions. Romney announces Ryan as his running mate \u201cMy dad died of a heart attack at 55, my grandfather at 57, so I\u2019ve always had this incentive to stay healthy,\u201d he told CNN\u2019s Gloria Borger last year. And he is an avid hunter, as Green was reminded one day when he thought of reconnecting with his friend and sent an email from his post as U.S. ambassador to Tanzania. \u201cI got this terse response saying, \u2018I\u2019m sitting in a deer stand. It\u2019s hunting season. Leave me alone.\u2019\u201d Ryan is a policy wonk, a self-described nerd who cut his teeth working for conservatives Bill Bennett and Jack Kemp. He says the debate should be about policy ideas \u2013 not about him. But friends also say it would be a mistake to underestimate his ambition, or his competitive streak. Which is why while he would undoubtedly be honored to be tapped for the ticket, and given a chance to debate Biden, Ryan clearly relishes being at the center of the national debate with the man in the Oval Office. \u201cI love the idea of Barack Obama,\u201d he says. \u201cI love the fact that we elected an African-American man as our president. I think that is a really cool thing. I just don\u2019t like the ideas coming from Barack Obama.\u201d How do you feel about Romney selecting Ryan as his VP pick? Let us know on CNN iReport.",

            "article_content": "Voters are weary of congressional bickering over health care law Polls show voter attitudes about health care law unchanged, polarized Some rural doctors worry about becoming political pawns in debate Thomas Dean is sick of all the congressional bickering over the health care law. Sure, the small town doctor understands the law\u2019s technical nuances and what\u2019s at stake for the millions of people covered by President Barack Obama\u2019s biggest policy achievement. Sure, he knows the law has its problems and that House Republicans are pushing \u2013 for the 33rd time \u2013 to repeal what has become known as \u201cObamacare,\u201d or parts of it. But Dean, who is one of only three physicians in Wessington Springs, South Dakota, a town of roughly 1,000 people, has had just about enough of the time-consuming arguments on Capitol Hill. Rep. Van Hollen talks health care repeal Rep. Hensarling weighs in on health care \u201cIt\u2019s complicated and it\u2019s easily manipulated and easily demagogued. I\u2019m tired of the politics. \u2026 The gridlock has hurt us for sure,\u201d Dean said as he took a break from his rounds. \u201cWe need to move forward with what we have.\u201d Republicans defend another repeal vote on health care law Dean is not alone in his exasperation. Americans have long held entrenched positions on the Affordable Care Act. According to a CNN/ORC International poll conducted immediately after the Supreme Court upheld the law two weeks ago, 52% of those polled said they favored all or most of the law\u2019s provisions, while 47% opposed them. Those types of numbers \u201chave been set in stone\u201d since the law\u2019s passage in 2010, said Mollyann Brodie, senior vice president for public opinion and survey research for the Kaiser Family Foundation. A similar poll conducted by Kaiser just after the ruling found that 47% of those polled were in favor of the ruling, 43% were against and 10% were unsure. \u201cThe sense of voter fatigue depends on the voter\u2019s (political) position,\u201d Brodie said. \u201cThose in favor are tired of this ongoing debate and want opponents to drop their efforts. For Republicans and those who oppose the law, they are absolutely content to keep going.\u201d That leaves independents, the highly coveted voting bloc that is the holy grail of election year politics. But, according to Kaiser\u2019s polling, independents are tired of the back-and-forth too, Brodie said. \u201cThose folks are more likely to say it\u2019s time to move on and they\u2019re tired of this,\u201d Brodie said. They are folks like Vietnam veteran Hans Engel. \u201cMy big thing is if you put all of Congress on Social Security, I bet that thing would get solved real quick,\u201d Engel said as he prepared for the night\u2019s spaghetti dinner at Firestone VFW Post 3383 in Akron, Ohio. As a disabled veteran on Medicare, he worries about how potential cuts to entitlement spending will affect his health care \u2013 especially as he and fellow baby boomers age and more of them rely on the program. What the health care ruling means to you \u201cI\u2019m all for sacrifice across the board,\u201d he said, referring to proposals to trim the nation\u2019s debt. \u201cI paid into it all my life and this is the baloney you\u2019re gonna pull?\u201d He\u2019s also concerned about the law\u2019s costs. \u201cI\u2019m a registered Democrat, but more and more and more I\u2019m looking a different way,\u201d Engel said. \u201cThey want to keep taxing and spending our money.\u201d Engel\u2019s frustration is pretty indicative of broader voter fatigue when it comes to debate over the health care law and most things in Congress, said David Bositis, a senior research associate at the Joint Center for Political and Economic Studies, pointing to Congress\u2019 abysmal approval rating. \u201cI don\u2019t think voters are paying attention to what Congress is doing right now,\u201d Bositis said. \u201cThey think Congress \u2013 especially the House \u2013 is a bunch of fools. These guys are like characters out of \u2018Saturday Night Live.\u2019 \u201c Voters are also not fooled about what the House vote on repealing the law is really about, Bositis said. \u201cThis is just a campaign stunt and voters are fed up,\u201d he said. Voters know that \u201cwhen these guys are campaigning they\u2019re going to say \u2018I voted to get rid of Obamacare.\u2019 \u201c At the Ballinger Memorial Hospital, a 25-bed hospital in Ballinger, Texas, the center\u2019s staff is acutely aware of the high-stakes political debate over the health care law taking place in Washington. But with a service area of 635 square miles, and 8,500 citizens to serve \u2013 in a state that the federal Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality recently recently ranked worst in delivering health care services \u2013 Ballinger officials, like many rural health care providers, say they want Congress to keep them out of a high-stakes games of political chicken. \u201cWe don\u2019t want rural to be used as a poker chip in an election game,\u201d said Ballinger administrator Lance Keilers.

            "article_content": "Tea party-infused talk of confrontation absent from some GOP House candidates \"Young Guns\" stress need to work with Democrats to get things done in Washington Group includes openly gay ex-Massachusetts state lawmaker, black female mayor from Utah What a difference two years make. Instead of a band of rabble-rousing conservatives, a markedly different group was plotting campaign strategy with House Republican leaders at a recent party headquarters meeting. Gone is the tea party-infused talk of confrontation. This diverse group \u2013 top-tier candidates picked to be in the GOP\u2019s \u201cYoung Guns\u201d program \u2013 includes an openly gay former Massachusetts state legislator, an African-American female mayor from Utah and an Indian-American Ivy league graduate from California. Unlike the take-no-prisoners approach of two years ago, these candidates stressed the need to work with Democrats to get things done in Washington. Richard Tisei, who was one of the few Republicans in the Democratic-dominated Massachusetts Senate, said that voters are frustrated with a polarized Congress and that he has a record of getting things done. \u201cI can bring my experience, having served in the Legislature on, you know, a state level, down here and hopefully bring some common sense and willingness to work across the aisle,\u201d Tisei told CNN. If Tisei beats eight-term Democratic Rep John Tierney in November, he would be the first House Republican to say he\u2019s gay while running for a first term in office. He supports same-sex marriage and signed onto a legal challenge to overturn the Defense of Marriage Act, a law GOP leaders are fighting to uphold in the federal courts. \u201cI am a live-and-let-live Republican. I think the government, again, should get off your back, out of your wallet and away from the bedroom,\u201d Tisei said. Further proof that he doesn\u2019t fit the traditional GOP candidate mold \u2013 Tisei refuses to sign a pledge that he will not raise taxes. \u201cIf there are loopholes that could be closed, help pay down the deficit, I don\u2019t want to tie myself up in knots. I want the option of being able to do what needs to be done to help the country,\u201d he said. The Young Guns program Tisei recently joined was started in 2007 by three Republican rising stars \u2013 Reps. Eric Cantor of Virginia, Paul Ryan of Wisconsin and Kevin McCarthy of California. The three were concerned their party wasn\u2019t doing enough to grow its base and recruit candidates in districts where the GOP lost in 2006. The program grew to support 90 candidates in 2009 and became part of the National Republican Congressional Commitee. Those selected for the program received financial and political support from the national party, and 62 of them won in 2010, helping to return the House gavel back to the GOP. Democrats have a similar program they call \u201cRed to Blue.\u201d McCarthy, who led GOP recruiting two years ago, which included outreach to females and minorities, told CNN \u201cthe caliber of the candidates has only improved higher because of the success of the last one.\u201d The third-ranking House Republican said he thinks leaders will pick 30 to 40 Young Guns by this fall. Fitting the \u201cyoung\u201d part of the bill is Indian-American Ricky Gill, 25, who hopes he\u2019ll become the youngest member of Congress next year. A Princeton University graduate who has endorsements from popular Republican Govs. Chris Christie of New Jersey and Nikki Haley of South Carolina, Gill said his campaign represents a \u201cGOP version 2.0.\u201d He boasts that he\u2019s raised the most money of any Republican challenger in the country in his bid to unseat Democratic Rep. Jerry McNerney in California. Gill said the 9th Congressional District in California is the \u201cquintessential swing\u201d district.  \u201cThe person who\u2019s going to win that race is the one who creates broad agreement about the issues of our day \u2013 it\u2019s getting people back to work; it\u2019s focusing on our agriculture economy. Those actually are consensus issues.\u201d More so than Tisei or Gill, Mia Love may defy most people\u2019s expectations of a GOP candidate \u2013 a black, conservative Mormon from Utah. If elected to represent Utah\u2019s 4th Congressional District, Love, the mayor of Saratoga Springs, would be the first black Republican congresswoman. \u201cThere are a lot of people who have tried to define me as a person,\u201d Love, a daughter of Haitian immigrants, told CNN\u2019s Kyra Phillips in an interview last month. This year, McCarthy and other Republicans said divided government in Washington means candidates need to stress their ability to find solutions. Brad Dayspring, a senior adviser to YG Action Fund, a super PAC that supports House Republican candidates, told CNN that in 2010 candidates talked about repealing President Barack Obama\u2019s health care overhaul, criticizing the spending in the stimulus program and opposing Democratic proposals such as cap and trade, but this year the message centers on \u201csolving problems.\u201d Dayspring, a former Cantor aide, said the party\u2019s ideology and issues aren\u2019t changing as Republicans work to increase the GOP majority, but he noted \u201ca conservative in Massachusetts is going to look a lot different from a conservative in Arkansas.\u201d His group is evaluating GOP candidates across the country and plans to support 15 to 25 this cycle. House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, insists the party isn\u2019t getting a makeover, saying Friday of these candidates, \u201cWe didn\u2019t choose them for their demographics or their style. They just happen to be good candidates in districts that are winnable for us.\u201d Democrats facing these Young Gun candidates said their talk of compromise doesn\u2019t add up. Early and often Democrats are tying all of these challengers to the House GOP budget authored by Ryan, which passed without a single Democratic vote and which, they argue, will end Medicare. Gill refuses to get drawn in, saying he \u201csalutes the idea of us having this discussion,\u201d but steers clear of personally endorsing the House Republican plan and instead zeroes in on his support of one piece of the plan that Ryan co-authored with a Senate Democrat. Democrats insist Republicans will change their moderate message if they win, and they\u2019ll become just like the GOP members elected two years ago. Tierney, Tisei\u2019s Democratic opponent in Massachusetts, told CNN, \u201cHe\u2019s going to fall right in line with them, and they\u2019re the ones that won\u2019t compromise and we\u2019ve had compromise all the way up until the tea party election in 2010.\u201d Rep. Adam Kinzinger, an llinois freshman Republican who was one of the Young Guns two years ago, said 2010 was \u201ca very special year because people were just ticked off so you saw all these grass-roots Americans saying I can run for Congress, and I did that as a military guy with no significant legislative experience.\u201d But Kinzinger said that 2010 was an \u201coutlier\u201d election and that this year candidates need to show a vision for how they\u2019ll produce results. \u201cI think it\u2019s important that Republicans and Democrats start basically reaching across the aisle and finding the areas (where) we agree and at least moving forward on those,\u201d he said. Despite the anti-incumbent mood and approval ratings for Congress at a record low, McCarthy, the House majority whip, said he believes voters will stick with Republicans this fall. \u201cI think the public sees some change in Congress, but they want to finish the job,\u201d he said. Although Boehner recently warned there was a 1-in-3 chance Republicans could lose seats in the House, McCarthy was more bullish on the party\u2019s electoral position, telling CNN that \u201cthere\u2019s an opportunity to gain in the overall number\u201d of GOP seats.  He cited the Young Guns program as the way to \u201ckeep us on offense.\u201d CNN\u2019s Dana Bash and Rebecca Stewart contributed to this report.",

But the reality was none of the measures had enough votes to pass, and much of the exercise was an effort by both parties to score political points and embarrass the other side \u2013 another display of partisan maneuvering that polls show frustrates voters. Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell opened the debate by accusing Democrats of being \u201cirresponsible\u201d for not passing a formal budget this year. Senate mired in 'do nothing' quagmire \u201cIf you\u2019re looking for a simple, three-word description of the Democrat approach to the problems we face, it\u2019s this: duck and cover. They don\u2019t have a budget of their own. They\u2019re going to vote against their own president\u2019s budget later today and they\u2019re going to vote against every budget Republicans put up.\u201d Obama, congressional leaders talk about debt Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid fired back, saying the Senate had already agreed to funding levels for 2013 and was too busy to deal with \u201cstunt budgets\u201d offered by Republicans. \u201cWe can\u2019t afford to waste any time,\u201d Reid said.  \u201cYet today Republicans will force the Senate to waste a day on a series of political show votes.\u201d Republicans commandeered the floor by taking advantage of a seldom-used Senate rule that allows any senator to offer a budget if the Budget Committee has not passed a budget resolution by April 1. In this case, Republicans called up five budgets: one that closely mirrored President Obama\u2019s budget proposal submitted earlier this year; another, authored by House Budget Chairman Paul Ryan, R-Wisconsin, which the House approved; and three from very conservative senators aimed at making drastic reductions to entitlements costs, government spending and taxes. Romney, GOP try to shift focus to deficit Going into the day, everyone knew none of the bills would get the 51 votes needed to succeed.  And, as Republicans had calculated, the president\u2019s budget got zero yes votes, providing Republicans with the political ammunition they sought for the campaign trail this year. \u201cThe president\u2019s 2013 budget would expand the scope of government by spending more money, increase taxes on job creators, and continue on the path of enormous deficits and record debt,\u201d explained Sen. Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa. Several Democrats, however, said they voted against the president\u2019s budget not because they oppose its broad principles but because it was submitted several months ago and is now out of date. \u201cIt misrepresents the president\u2019s budget,\u201d said Sen. Ben Cardin, D-Maryland, a liberal who is up for re-election \u201cThe numbers have changed since then.\u201d Sen. Sherrod Brown, D-Ohio, another liberal who also is running for re-election, said he was not going to fall for a GOP trap. \u201cIt\u2019s become too much of a game for these guys,\u201d he said just as he entered the chamber to cast his vote against the motion representing the Obama budget. Centrist Democrat Joe Manchin, who is also up for re-election in closely divided West Virginia, said he opposed all the GOP budgets because \u201cthey would destroy Social Security and Medicare \u2013 all while protecting the wealthy\u201d and the president\u2019s budget because \u201cit digs an even deeper debt hole for the next generation.\u201d The House Republican budget got 41 Republican votes and zero Democratic votes.  Five Republicans, including Sen. Scott Brown who is facing a tough re-election fight in Massachusetts, voted against it. A proposal from Sen. Pat Toomey, R- Pennsylvania, that would balance the budget in eight years got 42 Republican votes and no Democratic votes. A proposal from Sen. Rand Paul, R-Kentucky, that would cut eliminate several cabinet agencies \u2013 including Commerce, Education, Housing and Urban Developments and Energy \u2013 only got 16 votes. And a proposal from Sen. Mike Lee, R-Utah, which would institute a flat tax, raise the eligibility age for Social Security, and repeal \u201cObamacare\u201d only got 17 votes. Senate Budget Committee Chairman Kent Conrad, D-North Dakota, complained the GOP budget proposals \u201cwould take us right back to the failed policies that brought this country to the brink of economic collapse.  That\u2019s what happened the last time they were in charge.\u201d At a news conference, authors of the three conservative budgets bristled at the suggestion they were involved in \u201cgotcha\u201d politics.  Instead, they argued they deserved credit for having the political courage to put their ideas up for votes, and criticized Democrats for not doing the same. \u201cI think this suggestion this could be, as you put it, a \u2018gotcha\u2019 moment, ignores the rather striking reality which is the failure to put forward something, and the willingness simply to stand back and criticize those who have put forward something is itself a gotcha,\u201d said Lee.  \u201cThat\u2019s really the problem. Putting forward something isn\u2019t a gotcha.  Criticizing those who do, while doing nothing, is.\u201d",

            "article_content": "For the first time a political campaign is targeting voters by ZIP code on YouTube U.S. Chamber of Commerce is running the ads in seven New York state districts The technology to target ads to specific ZIP codes was just released in March by Google Google says collected data does not contain any personally identifiable information Targeted political advertising is heading to a new but very familiar frontier \u2013 YouTube. If you live in Syracuse or Long Island, New York, and go to the popular video sharing site in the next two weeks to find a news clip or view a favorite home decorating show, the first thing that will pop up on your screen will be a political ad. For the first time a political campaign is targeting voters by ZIP code on YouTube. The U.S. Chamber of Commerce added this new advertising tool to the broadcast media strategy it recently launched focused on a number of House and Senate races, one of the earliest and biggest efforts the pro-business lobby has unveiled to date. In seven New York congressional districts where the Chamber is running paid television ads, it added a new layer \u2013 running those TV ads on YouTube. \u201cThe stakes of this election are huge for the business community and we recognize as we roll out our different phases of the campaigns, we\u2019re going to use broadcast but we\u2019re also going to use YouTube,\u201d said Scott Reed, senior political strategist for the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. \u201cWe\u2019re going to use the Internet to reinforce and repeat and repeat and repeat the messages of how important it is to have a growing economy and candidates that are pro-growth.\u201d Anyone who visits YouTube in the next two weeks \u2013 and whose IP address or computer location falls within any of the ZIP codes of the specific New York districts \u2013 will see the Chamber\u2019s ad before seeing a video clip. The program, called \u201cTrueView\u201d allows the user five seconds to \u201copt out,\u201d or stop playing the political ad. And the Chamber only pays for the ads that people watch. Corporate advertisers have been using so-called \u201cpre-roll ads\u201d on websites to sell toothpaste or preview a movie coming to theaters soon. But the technology to target ads to specific ZIP codes was just released in March by Google, which owns YouTube, according to Rob Saliterman, who leads Google\u2019s advertising sales to political campaigns and issue advocacy groups. The Obama campaign pioneered targeting voters online and on mobile devices in 2008, and both parties now feature online outreach components to get out their messages. But this effort is the first instance of a campaign turning to YouTube to aim its political pitch at specific ZIP codes. Reed calls combining the online ads with TV a \u201cone-two punch.\u201d The effort includes a variety of ads, which the Chamber is using to gauge how voters respond to different messages online. Three positive ads promote the pro-business credentials of GOP freshman Reps. Ann Marie Buerkle, Chris Gibson, and Nan Hayworth. Three negative ads, which the Chamber calls \u201ccontrast\u201d ads, criticize Democratic Reps. Louise Slaughter, Kathy Hochul and Bill Owens for supporting \u201cObamacare\u201d and argue they oppose pro-growth policies. One ad combines criticism of Democratic incumbent Rep. Tim Bishop with a plug for his GOP challenger Randy Altschuler. A Nielson study commissioned by Google last year found that viewers who see advertising across multiple platforms are more likely to retain the message. The Chamber\u2019s strategy demonstrates it believes the same successful experience businesses found with online ads could translate into the political arena. Dan Maffei, who is challenging Buerkle to retake the central New York seat she knocked him out of in 2010, isn\u2019t convinced that this kind of micro-targeting will make a big difference in the fall election. \u201cIt doesn\u2019t surprise me that big money is going to come in on my opponent Anne Marie Buerkle\u2019s side because she supports these big business things that are good for them, but it\u2019s not at all connecting to our local chamber of commerce,\u201d Maffei told CNN. Maffei said his local Syracuse chamber didn\u2019t contribute to the ad or sign off on the effort and said the national business lobby\u2019s message doesn\u2019t mesh with local concerns. \u201cIt\u2019s almost like it\u2019s just coming in from above with a message that\u2019s generic in an attempt to prop her up in a district where she doesn\u2019t have that kind of support, even from small businesses,\u201d he said. The Chamber\u2019s television campaign is a multimillion-dollar effort, but Reed declined to say how much specifically the chamber is spending on the YouTube component. One expert familiar with online advertising says the average cost of a pre-roll ad is roughly 10 to 15 cents per view. Over the course of two weeks, potentially thousands of users could view each of the ads in the seven districts. Saliterman stressed that the data collected on the ads does not contain any personally identifiable information, but Google can pull together some aggregate data on age and gender and interest categories based on who watches the ads on YouTube. Reed calls the data it will get from the YouTube after the two-week run \u201csurvey research.\u201d \u201cWe\u2019re able to go in and look at how long people are on the ads, if they like the ads and stay until the end of the ad, if they stay on more for a positive ad or a contrast ad,\u201d Reed said, adding, \u201cthis is another tool to help us decide if our ads are penetrating and working and getting to the voters.\u201d It\u2019s no surprise that YouTube is the place to start this type of targeted political outreach. More than 2 billion videos are streamed each day on its website and approximately 100 million unique users in the United States click on the site every month, according to YouTube\u2019s own statistics. Earlier this year, the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee paid to run an ad on You Tube hitting the House Republican\u2019s budget proposal and featuring actor Martin Sheen. It targeted users who typed any search for \u201cMedicare.\u201d But the Chamber\u2019s move to focus resources to reach voters in specific congressional districts could prove to be a more effective use of money. Television ads are pricey and candidates are often forced to buy time in markets that broadcast outside their particular district\u2019s borders. With people increasingly turning to mobile devices to get news or view entertainment programming on their own schedules, fewer people are watching television programs when they actually air. A study in Ohio last fall conducted by Targeted Victory, a group working with Republican pollsters, found that 40% of likely voters were \u201cgoing off the grid\u201d and had not watched live television within the previous week. The Chamber\u2019s move is a reflection of the changing environment that can make getting political messages out a greater challenge. \u201cWe know in today\u2019s fractured media world, people get their messages from many different places, and the Internet is becoming the top place,\u201d Reed noted. \u201cTechnology is very important to reaching voters, and clearly the Obama campaign showed that and we (Democrats) used Twitter and Facebook and all that to get our message out,\u201d Maffei said. But the Democratic candidate said he believes Buerkle\u2019s constituents will focus on the GOP congresswoman\u2019s record this fall more than the message in the 30-second online ad. \u201cYou have to talk to voters,\u201d Maffei said. \u201cYou can\u2019t just spoon-feed them.\u201d CNN.s Dana Bash contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Democrats hoped to run against Mourdock, who they say is too \"extreme\" Mourdock defeated Lugar, GOP's longest-serving senator, in primary Cook Political Report moved the race from \"likely\" GOP win to leaning that way Democrats hope disillusioned Lugar backers will cross lines With longtime Republican Sen. Dick Lugar going down in defeat, Democrats were quick to paint the conservative candidate who beat him in Indiana\u2019s primary as \u201ctoo extreme.\u201d The result in Indiana was what Democrats had hoped for, but as the old proverb goes: \u201cBe careful what you wish for, it might just come true.\u201d Lugar is the longest-serving Republican in the Senate and is known as a moderate who has been willing to reach across the aisle to work with Democrats during his 36 years in the chamber. He was defeated by more than 20 points in Tuesday\u2019s primary by Richard Mourdock, the two-term Indiana state treasurer, a much more conservative candidate who enjoyed strong backing from local and national tea party groups, as well as some other leading fiscal conservative organizations. Mourdock says he doesn\u2019t anticipate successful compromise in the Senate and hopes bipartisanship will be defined as Democrats backing the Republican agenda following the 2012 elections. \u201cI hope to build a conservative majority so bipartisanship becomes Democrats joining Republicans to roll back the size of government, reduce the bureaucracy and get America moving again,\u201d Mourdock said Wednesday morning on CNN\u2019s \u201cStarting Point with Soledad O\u2019Brien.\u201d He added that those on both sides of the aisle should not compromise their principles, saying that \u201cone side or the other has to win this argument, one side or the other will dominate.\u201d Minutes after Mourdock\u2019s victory over Lugar, national Democrats were quick to characterize Mourdock as too extreme for Indiana. \u201cRichard Mourdock is a right wing Tea Party ideologue who questioned the constitutionality of Medicare and Social Security, says there should be more partisanship and less compromise in Washington, and actually compared himself to Rosa Parks,\u201d declared Guy Cecil, the executive director of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, in a statement. Mourdock discusses Ind. GOP primary win Lugar: My service isn't concluded Dick Lugar reflects on his Senate career \u201cTens of thousands of Hoosiers who have voted for Dick Lugar their entire voting lives are going to reject a Tea Party candidate like Richard Mourdock and support an honest, common sense job creator like Joe Donnelly,\u201d added Cecil. Donnelly, the Democrats\u2019 Senate nominee, is a former small business owner and current three-term congressman who represents Indiana\u2019s second district, which includes South Bend and other areas of the north-central part of the state. Cecil compared Mourdock to Ken Buck, the former Weld County, Colorado, district attorney who defeated the more moderate former Lt. Gov. Jane Norton in Colorado\u2019s 2010 GOP Senate primary then went on to lose his general election challenge to Democratic Sen. Michael Bennet. National Democrats hope that Donnelly will fare better against Mourdock than he would have against Lugar in a general election, where moderate voters from both parties and independents are crucial in determining who wins and loses. National Republicans quickly rallied around Mourdock. Sen. John Cornyn of Texas, chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee, said in a statement that Mourdock \u201chas the NRSC\u2019s full support and we are committed to helping elect him as Indiana\u2019s next U.S. Senator in November.\u201d And Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky said he fully backs Mourdock and looks \u201cforward to welcoming him to the United States Senate next year.\u201d Freshman Sen. Marco Rubio of Florida, a darling of conservatives, sent an e-mail to his fundraising list Tuesday night, asking people to donate to Mourdock\u2019s campaign. While Republicans rally around Mourdock, Democrats have the match-up they dreamed about in Indiana. They suggest that many \u201cdisillusioned\u201d Lugar supporters may now cross over and vote for Donnelly. And Cecil said that the Mourdock victory over Lugar \u201cmakes the Indiana Senate race a toss-up.\u201d But that\u2019s not the take right now from two of the top non-partisan political handicappers. The Rothenberg Political Report is keeping its ranking of the contest as \u201cLean Republican.\u201d \u201cRichard Mourdock isn\u2019t Christine O\u2019Donnell,\u201d says Stuart Rothenberg, the report\u2019s editor and publisher. O\u2019Donnell was the tea party-backed candidate in Delaware who pulled an upset in the state\u2019s 2010 GOP Senate primary, defeating longtime Rep. Mike Castle, the GOP establishment candidate. O\u2019Donnell lost by 16 points in the general election to Democrat Chris Coons. \u201cWhile a Mourdock-Donnelly race will start off close, with some Republicans bitter over Dick Lugar\u2019s loss, over the long haul, Democrats have a decidedly uphill fight in this Republican-leaning state,\u201d Rothenberg added. The Cook Political Report is moving its rating of the race from \u201cLikely Republican\u201d to \u201cLean Republican.\u201d \u201cThis race is more competitive than it would have been if Lugar were the GOP nominee. We don\u2019t feel that it\u2019s in the toss up column now, but there\u2019s a potential to get there,\u201d saysJennifer Duffy, who covers Senate races for Cook. Then-Sen. Barack Obama won Indiana in 2008, the first Democrat to capture the state in a presidential election in 40 years. But Obama\u2019s re-election campaign may not spend a great amount of money and resources to try to keep the state in the \u201cD\u201d column this November, further complicating the Democrats\u2019 hopes of capturing Lugar\u2019s Senate seat. As for the big picture, the Democrats currently hold a 53-47 majority in the Senate. But they are defending 23 of the 33 seats up for grabs in November.",

            "article_content": "NEW: The House passes a Republican plan to extend lower interest rates on student loans Democrats and Republicans differ on how to pay for the proposal The White House says the Republican plan would hurt women Republicans accuse Democrats of creating a fake fight over the issue The White House said Friday that President Barack Obama would veto a Republican measure passed by the House to extend lower interest rates on federal student loans because it takes money from a health care fund that benefits women. A White House statement said Obama\u2019s senior advisers would recommend a veto if the House measure, which passed 215-195 on a largely party-line vote, were to win Senate approval and reach the president\u2019s desk. \u201cWomen, in particular, will benefit from this prevention fund, which would provide for hundreds of thousands of screenings for breast and cervical cancer,\u201d the White House statement said. \u201cThis is a politically motivated proposal and not the serious response that the problem facing America\u2019s college students deserves. If the president is presented with H.R. 4628, his senior advisers would recommend that he veto the bill.\u201d Obama favors extending the current lower interest rates on student loans but would seek a different way to pay the $6 billion cost. A proposal by Senate Democrats would pay for the measure by ending some tax loopholes for corporations, a move opposed by Republicans. The House plan would instead take the money from the health care fund, which is part of the 2010 Affordable Care Act detested by Republicans. House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, proposed the GOP\u2019s student loan measure this week in the face of a high-profile campaign by Obama that rallied college students \u2013 a key component of the vital youth vote in November \u2013 to pressure Congress to extend the lower student loan rates. Boehner: No one wants loan rates to rise Obama: Stop student loan rates' doubling Obama pushes for the youth vote Student loan interest rates to rise In addition, certain Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney pinned Boehner and congressional Republicans in a corner by coming out in favor of the lower rates this week. House Republicans previously backed a budget plan that called for letting the lower interest rates on student loans expire on July 1. In an emotional floor speech Friday, Boehner labeled the issue a fake fight mounted by Democrats for political advantage. \u201cPeople want to politicize this because it is an election year, but my God, do we have to fight about everything?\u201d Boehner said, at times pounding the podium. \u201cAnd no, now we are going to have a fight over women\u2019s health. Give me a break! This is the latest plank in the so-called war on women entirely created by colleagues across the aisle for political gain.\u201d Calling for a review of \u201cthe facts,\u201d Boehner said Obama\u2019s proposed budget called for reducing the same health care fund, which he labeled a \u201cslush fund.\u201d \u201cYou may have already forgotten that several months ago, you all voted to cut $4 billion out of this slush fund to pay for the payroll credit bill\u201d that extended a payroll tax cut, Boehner continued, shouting, \u201cSo, to accuse us of wanting to gut women\u2019s health is absolutely not true.\u201d On Thursday, Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid, D-Nevada, took exception to Republicans characterizing the health care fund as something inappropriate or sinister. \u201cYou call preventive care a \u2018slush fund\u2019?  I mean, they should be ashamed of themselves,\u201d Reid said. \u201cThis is saving people\u2019s lives, saving the country huge amounts of money.\u201d Asked about the payroll tax vote at a Friday news conference, House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi, D-California, said Democrats weren\u2019t happy about taking money from the fund for the payroll tax measure at the time and now want to ensure that the rest of the money stays in the fund. On the House floor, Pelosi said House Republicans were forced by Obama\u2019s publicizing of the issue to reverse their previous opposition to keeping the interest rates on federal student loans at the current 3.4% instead of letting them double to 6.8% on July 1. She said the House budget proposal by Rep. Paul Ryan, R-Wisconsin, called for allowing the interest rate to double in July, and that House Republicans had backed the plan as recently as last week. The new House measure would eliminate the Prevention and Public Health Fund, Pelosi said, accusing Republicans of protecting tax subsidies for the oil industry while wanting \u201cmom and children to pay the price.\u201d On Wednesday, Obama took on Boehner by name, telling students at the University of Iowa a spokesman in the speaker\u2019s office believed the president\u2019s focus on student loans is an effort to \u201cdistract people from the economy.\u201d The president told a rowdy audience, \u201cNow think about that for a second, because these guys don\u2019t get it.\u201d He told the cheering crowd, \u201cIf you do well, the economy does well. This is about the economy. What economy are they talking about? You are the economy.\u201d A few hours later, Boehner announced a Friday vote on the House measure and hit back at the president saying, \u201cThis week the president is campaigning and trying to invent a fight where there is none and never has been on this issue of student loans.\u201d On Tuesday night, Democratic Sens. Jack Reed of Rhode Island, Tom Harkin of Iowa and Sherrod Brown of Ohio introduced the Democratic proposal. It would freeze the current interest rate for one year and pay for it by closing a loophole on \u201cS corporations,\u201d a tax structure Democrats say can be used to avoid paying Social Security and Medicare taxes. The Republican proposal in House also extends the current rate for one year, but it covers the cost by dipping into the health care fund intended to promote wellness, prevent disease and protect against public health emergencies.",

Romney\u2019s wins in Wisconsin, Maryland and the District of Columbia put him past the halfway mark to the 1,144 delegates needed to clinch the nomination and add to a wide delegate lead that he holds over the other major GOP presidential candidates, according to CNN estimates. Yet Santorum indicated Tuesday night he would compete in the April 24 primaries in five states, including Pennsylvania, where his campaign hopes a win would be a gateway to a run of May primaries in states where he can capitalize on higher percentages of conservative voters. Romney, in a speech to supporters in Milwaukee, made no mention of his GOP rivals and instead mostly contrasted himself with President Barack Obama. \u201cThis has really been quite a night. We won a great victory tonight in our campaign to restore the promise of America,\u201d Romney said. Obama looking ahead to Romney face-off?

Ron Paul of Texas had 12%, and  former House Speaker Newt Gingrich had 6%. In Maryland, with 75% of the vote reported, Romney had 49%. Santorum had 29%, Gingrich had 11% and Paul had 10%. In the District of Columbia, with 99% of the vote reported, Romney had 70%. Paul had 12% and Gingrich had 11%. Santorum was not on the D.C. ballot. \u201cThere is a basic choice that we\u2019re going to face: The president has pledged to transform America, and he spent the last four years laying the foundation for a new government-centered society,\u201d Romney said. \u201cI will spend the next four years rebuilding the foundation of an opportunity society led by free people and free enterprises.\u201d Pre-primary polls appeared to show Wisconsin\u2019s contest was the only one Tuesday that Santorum had a chance to win. And analysts said Wisconsin might be Santorum\u2019s final chance to slow Romney\u2019s march toward the GOP nomination. Wisconsin exit poll | Maryland exit poll Ehrlich: Romney is strong Santorum looking ahead to PA primary Obama laughs at Romney's expense Romney running mate rumors But Santorum told supporters in Mars, Pennsylvania, on Tuesday night that the race was essentially at halftime, with only roughly half  the available delegates awarded. \u201cPennsylvania and half the other people in this country have yet to be heard, and we\u2019re going to go out and campaign here and across this nation to make sure that their voices are heard in the next few months,\u201d Santorum said. Santorum, who has touted himself as a more conservative candidate than Romney, also warned supporters that the Republican Party often has fielded moderate Republicans against incumbent Democratic presidents, only to see the moderate Republican lose. He appeared to raise Ronald Reagan, a conservative who defeated Jimmy Carter in 1980, as an example for a way forward. \u201cIf we\u2019re going to win this race, we can\u2019t have little differences between our nominee and President Obama. We have to have clear, contrasting colors,\u201d Santorum said. \u201c\u2026 Time and time again, the Republican establishment and aristocracy have shoved down the throats of the Republican Party and people across this country moderate Republicans because, of course, we have to win by getting people in the middle. There\u2019s one person who understood we don\u2019t win by moving to the middle. We win by getting people to the middle to move to us and move this country forward.\u201d President Barack Obama, meanwhile, clinched the Democratic presidential nomination Tuesday with primary wins in Maryland, the District of Columbia and Wisconsin, CNN projected. Unlike the Republicans, Obama faces no serious opposition in his race. 5 things we learned Tuesday According to CNN\u2019s delegate estimate, the president had 2,735 of the 2,778 delegates needed to secure his party\u2019s nod before Tuesday\u2019s contest.  He is expected to win most or all of the 119 delegates at stake in Maryland and D.C., as well as the 100 delegates at stake in Wisconsin. On the Republican side, since Romney\u2019s double-digit victory in Illinois two weeks ago \u2013 followed by a wave of some of the Republican Party\u2019s major names and elder statesmen endorsing him and urging a quick conclusion to the divisive nomination battle \u2013 the conversation seems to have changed: the GOP front-runner increasingly being called the inevitable nominee. Wisconsin exit polls show that endorsements might have helped Romney. About 60% of respondents said the Romney endorsements were a factor in their votes, and 33% called them an \u201cimportant\u201d factor. Most of those voters broke for Romney. CNN Chief Political Correspondent Candy Crowley reported that Romney\u2019s campaign was prepared to spend \u201ca lot of money and a lot of candidate time in Pennsylvania,\u201d where polls show Santorum\u2019s once-large lead has shrunk. Santorum\u2019s campaign points toward May, which looks friendlier for him. He could be the favorite in primaries in North Carolina and West Virginia on May 8, Nebraska on May 15, Arkansas and Kentucky on May 22 and Texas a week later. But it could be too little, too late by May. Sen. Hillary Clinton won most of the final contests against Sen. Barack Obama in the marathon 2008 Democratic presidential nomination battle. But in the end, it didn\u2019t matter. And Ari Fleischer, a CNN contributor and former George W. Bush White House spokesman, said that while he believed that Santorum earned the right to fight through Pennsylvania, the race was all but over. \u201cI think the writing is on the wall. Does Rick Satorum want to read it is the question,\u201d Fleischer said. Romney and Obama on Tuesday seemed to be turning their attention to November\u2019s general election, with Romney blasting the president during a campaign stop in Wisconsin and Obama mentioning Romney in a speech for the first time this year. Speaking at a restaurant in Waukesha, Wisconsin, Romney suggested Obama wants to duck responsibility \u201cfor what\u2019s happened in this country,\u201d saying the president should get full credit or blame for \u201cwhat\u2019s happened in this economy, and what\u2019s happened to gasoline prices under his watch.\u201d \u201cIt is time to have somebody who will take responsibility, and if I am president, I will not only get things right again, I will take full responsibility for my errors and make sure that people understand we have a president in the White House again where the buck will stop at his desk,\u201d Romney said, while standing with House Budget Committee Chairman Paul Ryan, a prominent Wisconsinite who endorsed Romney. Later Tuesday, Obama mentioned Romney while slamming a House-passed budget proposal that Ryan drew up and Romney embraced. Obama, speaking at a media luncheon in Washington, said the plan, which would lower tax rates and cut spending while reforming the Medicare and Medicaid government-run health care programs, was \u201cthinly veiled Social Darwinism\u201d and \u201cantithetical to our entire history as a land of opportunity and upward mobility for everyone who\u2019s willing to work for it.\u201d \u201cOne of my political opponents, Gov. Romney, has said that he hoped a similar version of this plan from last year would be introduced on day one of his presidency,\u201d Obama said. \u201cHe said that he\u2019s very supportive of this new budget and he even called it marvelous, which is a word you don\u2019t often hear when it comes to describing a budget.\u201d While Romney is far ahead of Santorum, Gingrich and Paul in the hunt for delegates, exit polls have indicated Romney still has a problem locking in the conservative base of the party. That continues to fuel Santorum\u2019s campaign, in which he continually depicts himself as the lone true conservative going up against the Republican establishment and liberal media bias. As in previous contests, Wisconsin\u2019s early exit polls showed Romney doing better among higher-earners and Santorum better with lower-income voters. Among exit-poll takers making $100,000 to $200,000 annually, Romney led 55%-30%, with Santorum winning the under-$30,000 voters, 44%-34%. The Wisconsin exit polls showed Santorum is more popular in rural areas and Romney in urban areas in Wisconsin. According to the exit polls, Santorum was winning the rural vote, 37%-27%, and Romney was winning big-city voters, 43%-23%. About 24% of the vote in Wisconsin came from urban areas and 22% from rural areas, according to the exit polls. The rest is suburban. Wisconsin\u2019s primary was open to any registered voter in the state, regardless of party. Exit polls showed that 58% described themselves as Republicans, 30% said they were independent and 12% said they were Democrats. Santorum was doing best among self-described Democrats with 32% of their vote, while Romney had 22% and Paul had 16%.

NEW: Santorum says he'll continue fight in home state, Pennsylvania, on April 24 Romney: \"We won a great victory tonight \" Romney more than halfway to 1,144 delegates he needs for nomination, CNN estimates Mitt Romney won all three of Tuesday\u2019s Republican presidential primaries, putting more distance between himself and his closest contender, Rick Santorum, who indicated he plans to fight on to his home state of Pennsylvania and beyond. Romney\u2019s wins in Wisconsin, Maryland and the District of Columbia put him past the halfway mark to the 1,144 delegates needed to clinch the nomination and add to a wide delegate lead that he holds over the other major GOP presidential candidates, according to CNN estimates. Yet Santorum indicated Tuesday night he would compete in the April 24 primaries in five states, including Pennsylvania, where his campaign hopes a win would be a gateway to a run of May primaries in states where he can capitalize on higher percentages of conservative voters. Romney, in a speech to supporters in Milwaukee, made no mention of his GOP rivals and instead mostly contrasted himself with President Barack Obama. \u201cThis has really been quite a night. We won a great victory tonight in our campaign to restore the promise of America,\u201d Romney said. He continued his criticism of Obama\u2019s economic polices and what he repeatedly called Obama\u2019s plan for a \u201cgovernment centered society.\u201d \u201cThere is a basic choice that we\u2019re going to face: The president has pledged to transform America, and he spent the last four years laying the foundation for a new government-centered society. I will spend the next four years rebuilding the foundation of an opportunity society led by free people and free enterprises.\u201d Ehrlich: Romney is strong Santorum looking ahead to PA primary The former Massachusetts governor is expected to take the majority of Wisconsin\u2019s 42 delegates and Maryland\u2019s 37 delegates, with some designated solely for the winner and the rest to be awarded proportionally. He will take all 16 delegates at stake in the District of Columbia. Counting partial allocations for Wisconsin and Maryland, and full allocations for D.C., Romney has collected 648 delegates since the primary and caucuses began in January, according to CNN estimates. That\u2019s more than twice the 264 delegates Santorum is estimated to hold. Gingrich and Paul trailed well back.

            "article_content": "Ron Pollack is the founding executive director of advocate group Families USA Pollack: \"ACA moves us very close to achieving health coverage for everyone\" He says criticisms that the health law is unconstitutional are \"very weak claims\" People with pre-existing conditions need the law's protections, Pollack says As the Supreme Court prepares to hear arguments in the constitutionality of the health care reform law, CNN spoke with two experts on opposing sides of the issue. Ron Pollack is the founding executive director of Families USA, a 30-year-old nonprofit supporting \u201cthe achievement of high-quality, affordable health care for all Americans.\u201d The group worked with the Obama administration and members of Congress to help pass the Affordable Care Act. (Karen Harned of the National Federation of Independent Business is against the health care reform law. Read her viewpoint here). The following interview with Pollack is edited for clarity and brevity: CNN: From your perspective, what does the Affordable Care Act accomplish? Pollack: \u201cACA moves us very close to achieving health coverage for everyone. The only people who would be excluded would be people who immigrated to the country and do not have documentation. Those who currently have coverage in the workplace will continue to do so. In fact, small businesses, which have the greatest difficulty paying for health care coverage for their workers, are already receiving tax credit subsidies to make such employer-supported insurance more affordable.\u201d Preview: \u2018The implications \u2026 are impossible to overstate\u2019 CNN: What is your message to the Supreme Court as they take on this legal challenge? Pollack: \u201cI think that the claims that have been made challenging the constitutional validity of different portions of the ACA are very weak claims. It\u2019s my hope that the justices protect the law and allow the law to go into effect. It\u2019s reform that\u2019s way overdue, it really is going to help the American public, even if much of the public is not even aware of the provisions that have yet to be implemented. And it\u2019s my hope that the court allows these provisions to go into effect. I think as these provisions do, they will be very popular.\u201d CNN: Does the fact it is an election year make this health care issue more politically charged? Health care reform's day in court Supreme Court to tackle health care Health care and the Commerce Clause Pollack: \u201cWe took 16 of the key elements of the ACA and compared them to the Massachusetts health reform [supported by then-Gov. Mitt Romney, now a leading Republican candidate for president], and they\u2019re virtually identical. This criticism of the ACA is more political than it is substantive. The reforms that were adopted in Massachusetts truly were a model for the ACA and even Gov. Romney at one point not too long ago indicated that he thought it would be a good model for the nation. \u201cMuch of the ideas that are not considered controversial were ideas that were originally introduced by Republicans. Having this new marketplace called exchanges \u2013 that\u2019s a Republican idea. It\u2019s creating a private marketplace for private insurance. I don\u2019t think that, innately, these are controversial items. They\u2019ve become controversial because of the politics of the moment. If President Obama supports something, Republicans will oppose it, not because they opposed it in the past.\u201d CNN: What are some of the major changes? Pollack: \u201c50 million uninsured \u2013 most people can\u2019t grasp that figure \u2013 will get coverage in two main ways. The law provides for an expansion of the Medicaid program. If you either live alone or in a household that has income below 133% of the poverty level, then you will be eligible for Medicaid. In 42 states, you could be penniless and not qualify for coverage \u2013 adults with no children. The ACA creates a floor under which nobody can fall. Two families, two viewpoints on health reform \u201cThe second change is for people with incomes just above 133% [of the poverty level]. For many of those people, it\u2019s unaffordable \u2013 $14,000 on average for family coverage. The new law allows you to go into a new private marketplace \u2013 called exchanges \u2013 and you can select an insurance plan that\u2019s in the exchange. You will get a tax credit subsidy to make the premiums more affordable. \u201cRight now, people seeking insurance when they have pre-existing conditions, are told: \u2018We\u2019re not going to sell insurance to you.\u2019 Or if they can get insurance: \u2018We\u2019re not going to cover the condition that drove you to desire the coverage. We\u2019re not going to cover your diabetes, your asthma.\u2019 That affects huge numbers of people. The people who need insurance the most are going to get this protection. The companies also cannot charge discriminatory premiums. \u201cA huge portion of the population that has insurance is limited on how much the insurance will pay out. Those limitations come in two forms \u2013 we\u2019re not going to pay out more than \u2018x\u2019 number of dollars per year, and we\u2019re not going to pay more than \u2018y\u2019 dollars over the life of the insurance policy. The ACA eliminates both of those. \u201cA significant portion of the premium does not actually go to your health care \u2013 instead [it goes] to advertising and marketing, administrative costs, agents\u2019 fees, profits. The ACA now places limitations on how much can be spent for those nonhealth benefit costs from your premium dollars. For small plans, at least 80 cents on the dollar must be spent on actual coverage. For larger plans, it\u2019s 85 cents on the dollar. The law is going to create some cost efficiencies.\u201d CNN: You argue seniors also benefit under the law. Pollack: \u201cThere are a host of insurance market reforms that are very valuable. For senior citizens , you don\u2019t think of them as uninsured. However, seniors have significant gaps in coverage. Two of the most prominent gaps are dealt with in the ACA. \u201cFor prescriptions, three-quarters of the cost is covered. Then around $2,500, you go into a no-coverage zone, euphemistically called the \u2018doughnut hole.\u2019 At that point, you\u2019re on your own. The ACA eliminates that hole in coverage. \u201cMedicare requires out-of-pocket cost for preventive care. Now there\u2019s no out-of-pocket costs. It tries to move Medicare from a sick-care coverage to a health-care coverage. You can get you checkup each year, tests, screenings, that some people don\u2019t get because they have to pay out of pocket and as a result, the condition does not get diagnosed in a timely manner.\u201d",

Santorum said Thursday, \u201cWe might as well stay with what we have\u201d in the White House when comparing Romney to President Barack Obama. An American Research Group poll conducted between Tuesday and Thursday showed Santorum leading Romney by a 43% to 27% margin. Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich had 20%, and Rep. Ron Paul had 6%. Santorum\u2019s statement Thursday sought to get more mileage from a Romney adviser\u2019s comments that to shift from the Republican primary to the general election was like shaking an Etch A Sketch toy, which his rivals were using to challenge Romney\u2019s conservative convictions. At an event in San Antonio, Santorum said, \u201cYou win by giving people the opportunity to see a different vision for our country, not someone who is just going to be a little different than the person in there. If they\u2019re going to be a little different, we may as well stay with what we have instead of taking a risk in what may be the Etch A Sketch candidate for the future.\u201d Santorum: No way I'd vote for Obama Is Romney a 'mirror image' of Obama? Romney on Trayvon: Inexplicable tragedy Gingrich: I'm staying in the race Santorum\u2019s rival campaigns seized on the remark. Rich Beeson, Romney\u2019s political director, said Santorum is \u201cbecoming the most valuable player on President Obama\u2019s team.\u201d At an event in Port Fourchon, Louisiana, on Friday, Gingrich said, \u201cI obviously have a lot of disagreements with Gov. Romney, but I think that to suggest that a Romney presidency would not be dramatically better for any conservative than an Obama presidency is just plain wrong. Just take the issue of Supreme Court justices, and the difference between the people that a Gov. Romney would pick and the people that a President Obama would pick is night and day.  It\u2019s a 180-degree difference. \u201cI hope Santorum is going to clarify it today, because it was clearly a major mistake, and it is a dangerous signal to send.\u201d Santorum spokeswoman Alice Stewart started the clarification early Friday on CNN\u2019s \u201cStarting Point,\u201d saying the former Pennsylvania senator was referring to voters who might not see the difference between the visions of Romney and the president, including their stances on health care, government spending and the Wall Street bailouts. \u201cWhat we need in order for the GOP to win is, we need to have a choice. We need to see a clear vision that is different from what we currently have,\u201d Stewart said. \u201cAnd with Mitt Romney, it\u2019s the same vision, and it\u2019s one that\u2019s not the right direction for this country. And he was worried that voters would have that feeling.\u201d Santorum later blamed Romney\u2019s campaign for distorting what he said, telling reporters at a rally in West Monroe, Louisiana, \u201cYou guys should do some real reporting and not what Gov. Romney feeds you.\u201d \u201cI have said repeatedly I will vote for whoever the Republican nominee is and I will work for them. Barack Obama is a disaster, but we can\u2019t have someone who agrees with him on some of the biggest issues of the day, and that is the problem with Gov. Romney: He doesn\u2019t provide the clear choice we need,\u201d Santorum said. But Gingrich said, \u201cI\u2019m often cheerful about bashing the media. I don\u2019t think the media said that. I think it was Santorum who said it. So it\u2019s a little tricky for him to attack them for reporting what he said. I\u2019m pretty sure the videotape shows him saying it.\u201d Romney saved most of his fire for Obama, using the second anniversary of the signing of the president\u2019s health care reform plan. At his first of two campaign events in Louisiana before Saturday\u2019s primary, Romney methodically picked apart \u201cObamacare,\u201d blaming the president for stifling economic growth with a law that he said most people want to repeal. \u201cYou\u2019ll note the White House is not celebrating Obamacare today,\u201d Romney told a small audience inside a New Orleans-area mall, where teenagers were filing past to catch a morning screening of \u201cThe Hunger Games.\u201d \u201cThey don\u2019t have any big ceremony going on,\u201d he said. \u201cThe president is not giving speeches on Obamacare, and that\u2019s for a reason. Most Americans want to get rid of it, and we\u2019re among those Americans. I want to get rid of it, too.\u201d Romney said he will sign an executive order on the first day of his administration giving states the ability to opt out of the Obama health care law. Vice President Joe Biden went after the Republican field over Medicare in a campaign speech before an audience of retirees in Coconut Creek, Florida. \u201cIf the Republicans in Congress and their Amen Corner of Romney, Santorum and Gingrich \u2013 if any one of them get their hands on the White House, the keys of the White House, I promise you, you will see Medicare ended as we know it. \u201cAnd it is not just about what they want to do to Medicare; it is about the other benefits for seniors that they want to undo.\u201d Romney\u2019s lead in a national tracking poll grew to its largest margin in weeks. The Gallup Poll showed that Romney was supported by 40% of registered Republicans nationwide, with Santorum second at 26%. Romney\u2019s total is the highest point for any candidate since the daily survey began measuring support in early November. It represents a 6-point increase since Tuesday, the same day he won the Illinois primary. Santorum dropped 4 points in the same period. The poll was conducted between Sunday and Thursday. Gingrich remained relatively steady at 14%, while Paul had a slight decline to 8%. All four candidates were campaigning Friday in Louisiana, where 20 delegates are at stake. Gingrich has spent most of the week campaigning there, hoping to regain the strength he once had in the South. Gingrich stopped Romney\u2019s early momentum by winning in South Carolina in January. He also won in Georgia, which he represented in Congress for two decades, on Super Tuesday, but Santorum won contests in Tennessee, Alabama and Mississippi. But no matter how he finishes in Louisiana, Gingrich shows no signs of ending his campaign, telling CNN\u2019s Piers Morgan that \u201cI\u2019m staying in the race because I believe we ought to have a conservative who\u2019s serious, who\u2019s had national achievements and who doesn\u2019t write his policy on an Etch A Sketch and zig-zag back and forth wildly.\u201d \u201cThere may be a morning Gov. Romney has a majority of the delegates,\u201d he said. \u201cThat morning isn\u2019t here.\u201d Romney has 562 delegates, according to CNN estimates, nearly half the 1,144 delegates necessary to clinch the GOP nomination. Santorum has 249 delegates, Gingrich has 137 and Paul has 71. CNN\u2019s Peter Hamby, Michael Pearson, Gabriella Schwarz and Gregory Wallace contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "The House votes 223-181 to eliminate an independent panel on Medicare cuts The measure is not expected to win Senate approval The panel is supposed to help develop cost-saving Medicare reforms Congress has been unable to bring down Medicare costs In the bitter political debate over health care reform two years ago, one of the most contentious issues was a proposed advisory board that would recommend how to achieve needed but as-yet-unreachable Medicare savings. The repeal measure passed 223-181 on a mostly party-line vote, reflecting the deep partisan divide over health care reform that persists two years after Democrats pushed the measure through Congress. Seven Democrats joined 216 Republicans in support of the repeal, while 10 Republicans voted \u201cno.\u201d While the move to repeal the Independent Payment Advisory Board is expected to eventually fall short in the Senate, it gives opponents of health care reform a rallying point for their continued efforts to undermine the 2010 law. Opponents dubbed the Independent Payment Advisory Board (IPAB) a \u201cdeath panel\u201d that would ration medical coverage for senior citizens based on cost and effectiveness, rather than decisions reached between patient and doctor. \u201cWhat we oppose is the president deciding who gets what,\u201d Rep. Tom Price, R-Georgia, told a news conference Wednesday. Earlier this week, Republican Rep. Scott DesJarlais of Tennessee told reporters that the IPAB panel was \u201cdesigned to put a Washington bureaucrat between the patient and their doctor.\u201d That\u2019s not the intent or the reality of the advisory board, insisted Dr. Donald Berwick, the former administrator of the federal Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. For example, the law targeted by the repeal effort specifically forbids the advisory board from rationing health care to reduce spending. \u201cWe\u2019re in a very polarized era. It\u2019s hard to have rational conversations with people\u201d on the issue, Berwick told CNN. Paul Van de Water, a senior fellow at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, said this week that \u201ccharges that the board is going to be able to deny people care are just flat out wrong.\u201d \u201cThe law makes every effort to restrict the board so that it can\u2019t do that,\u201d Van de Water said. \u201cAnd in fact, if anything, the charge is the opposite of the truth.\u201d The 15-member IPAB board would comprise independent experts to recommend Medicare cost reductions starting in 2015 if Congress and the health care industry and insurers fail to agree on $300 billion in savings called for in the health care reform law. Designed as a nonpolitical solution in the event of legislative stalemate, the panel\u2019s recommendations do not require congressional approval but can be offset by Congress. Some critics, including Democrats who back health care reform, cite the independent board\u2019s relative autonomy as a reason for eliminating it. In addition, Republican sponsors have added long-desired tort reform provisions against frivolous lawsuits to offset the cost of eliminating the panel intended to bring Medicare savings. However, the legal lobby and many Democrats oppose tort reforms, raising questions about the final makeup of the bill. According to Berwick, opposition to the IPAB panel breaks down into three groups: a \u201csignificant minority\u201d that hates the 2010 health care reform law and wants to scare people about it; political opponents of President Barack Obama trying to hurt his re-election chances, and health care providers and insurers \u201cdoing quite well in the status quo\u201d who are unwilling to commit to Medicare reforms. Despite such opposition, no one disputes the need to change Medicare in order to keep it solvent in coming decades, as baby boomers reach retirement age and flood its ranks. Republicans who have long opposed Medicare want to lower the cost by eventually making it a subsidized program instead of a government-run system. The House Republican budget for 2013 made public Tuesday would offer future seniors a choice of staying in the traditional fee-for-service Medicare plan or opting for a Medicare-approved private plan, all of which would be available via a new Medicare exchange. No matter which plan they chose, including the traditional Medicare plan, seniors would receive a government subsidy to help pay for their choice. The 2010 health care reform law sought cost reductions in Medicare through more efficient delivery of services. For example, it envisioned increased collaboration through electronic medical records to reduce repetitive and costly tests, as well as basing reimbursement on quality of care rather than quantity of services provided. \u201cIt\u2019s conceivable you could ratchet down on payments for routine MRIs or CAT scans and use some of that money to shore up payments to providers and \u2026 make the whole system a little more efficient,\u201d noted Uwe Reinhardt, a professor of economics and public affairs at Princeton University\u2019s Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs. Under the law, the IPAB panel would step in if targeted cost reductions went unmet. Those seeking repeal of the advisory board say it will lead to indiscriminate cost-cutting rather than the intended reforms to maintain Medicare\u2019s long-term solvency. Rep. Nan Hayworth, R-New York, who practiced ophthalmology for 16 years prior to her election to Congress in 2010, said Medicare reimbursements already were being lowered to a point where some physicians cannot afford to treat Medicare patients. \u201cThat is the last thing our seniors need,\u201d Hayworth said Wednesday. \u201cIn many practices across the country, that threat will only increase with IPAB.\u201d The American Medical Association, a major physician\u2019s advocacy organization, also wants to repeal the advisory board even though it supported the broader health care reform law. It already wrestles with what has been a 15-year problem involving Medicare reimbursements that exemplifies the difficulty of reforming the program. The Medicare Sustainable Growth Rate provision enacted in 1997 limits increases in Medicare costs to the same rate of growth in the gross domestic product. Under the formula, the costs have repeatedly risen higher than planned. Rather than cutting payments to Medicare doctors, Congress has regularly authorized extra money to make up the difference, with the latest so-called \u201cdoc fix\u201d set to expire at the end of 2012. That means doctors face a 30% cut in Medicare reimbursements from the government in January, and now the IPAB panel would be empowered to recommend steeper cuts, AMA board Chairman Dr. Robert Wah told CNN in a telephone interview. The AMA wants Congress to stabilize funding for Medicare reimbursements for five years to allow doctors time to work out reforms outlined in the 2010 health care legislation. According to Wah, the fear is that the IPAB panel will recommend across-the-board spending cuts that drive doctors away from Medicare patients while failing to inspire the necessary reforms. \u201cA board that doesn\u2019t have to answer to anybody and has the latitude to make dramatic cuts has consequences for our patients,\u201d said Wah, later adding: \u201cIt\u2019s very hard to do that kind of innovation when there is uncertainty and the threat of large cuts.\u201d For Berwick, the question is, \u201chow do you create the political and social will for uncomfortable changes?\u201d \u201cThe evidence so far is that motivation solely from inside health care, changing itself, is insufficient,\u201d he said.

Supporters called such rhetoric overheated and misleading, arguing the advisory board was necessary to motivate a reluctant health care industry to adopt cost-cutting reforms that Congress had proven unwilling or unable to impose.

            "article_content": "NEW:  The White House says there is time to work out a comprehensive deal House Republicans say they will not demand spending cuts to offset the payroll tax cut Republicans concede they had angered voters by pushing that issue late last year The move, House GOP leaders say, will blunt \"Democrats' political games\" In a sharp turnaround, House Republican leaders Monday dropped a key demand that the cost of extending the payroll tax cut be offset by spending cuts elsewhere in the budget. The decision removes a major obstacle to passage of the tax cut extension for the rest of the year \u2013 a move that has been in question. Democrats called the GOP decision welcome news \u2013 a \u201cmajor breakthrough,\u201d according to a Democratic aide familiar with the negotiations \u2013 because the tax cut, which would otherwise expire February 29, is a key part of President Barack Obama\u2019s economic recovery strategy. For Republicans, the move trims a thorny political issue. After nearly blocking an extension of the payroll tax cut late last year over concerns about how to pay for it, Republicans acknowledged they had angered voters. The top three Republican leaders in the House released a statement saying they were prepared to remove the contentious payroll issue from a bill that would also extend unemployment benefits and prevent a fee cut to Medicare doctors \u2013 known as the \u201cdoc fix\u201d \u2013 in order to \u201cprotect small businesses and our economy from the consequences of Washington Democrats\u2019 political games.\u201d Obama: Budget requires 'tough choices' Obama on the payroll tax ramifications Sen. McConnell on the payroll tax cut 'Pass the payroll tax cut without delay' \u201cUnfortunately, to date, Democrats have refused virtually every spending cut proposed \u2013 insisting on job-threatening tax hikes on small businesses and job creators \u2013 and with respect to the need for an extension of the payroll tax cut, time is running short,\u201d said the statement from House Speaker John Boehner, R-Ohio, House Majority Leader Eric Cantor, R-Virginia, and House Majority Whip Kevin McCarthy, R-California. In the past, House GOP leaders have often struggled to get rank-and-file conservative members to go along with their decisions on spending issues \u2013 particularly when related to negotiations with Democrats. The fact that all three leaders issued the statement was seen by aides in both parties as a sign that they expect to be able to pass the bill without conservatives who might break with the leadership. House Republicans will meet in closed session Tuesday to discuss the proposal, which could be voted on in the House by the end of the week, the leaders said. Aides in both parties said they expect negotiations to continue on the so-called \u201cdoc-fix\u201d and unemployment benefit extension. But they said removing the payroll issue from those talks should make it easier to reach agreement on them. Those talks would also include potential cost offsets for the payroll tax cut extension, even if it has already passed, the GOP leaders said in their statement. Sen. John Cornyn of Texas, who heads the Senate Republican election effort, said the decision removes a political hurdle for Republicans as they head into what\u2019s expected to be a hard-fought election. \u201cI think we all recognize that the president\u2019s playbook is one to run against Congress and claim we\u2019re the problem,\u201d he told CNN. White House Press Secretary Jay Carney insisted Monday there was time for Congress to work out a comprehensive agreement that would extend both the payroll tax cut and unemployment insurance. However, Carney stopped short of saying Obama would oppose the House proposal to separate the payroll tax provision from the other issues under negotiation. \u201cThis is a hypothetical proposal put out that they said they might do if conversations with folks on Capitol Hill don\u2019t progress according to the way they want,\u201d Carney told reporters. \u201cLet\u2019s just see how this process plays out.  Extending unemployment insurance as well as the so-called \u2018doc fix\u2019 is equally important \u2013 certainly very important, and very important for our economy.  So the president supports extending all of it, and doing it in a way that is easily achievable if folks put ideological and partisan positions aside.\u201d CNN\u2019s Tom Cohen contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Obama's budget plan won't pass Congress but reinforces his campaign narrative Obama is pushing higher taxes on the wealthy, a key campaign theme The president doesn't make politically tough choices on popular entitlement programs GOP nominee also unlikely to take bold stance on changes to programs like Medicare A piece of advice: If you\u2019re worried about President Barack Obama\u2019s budget, find something else to fret over.  The president\u2019s blueprint has about as much chance of becoming law as yours.  It\u2019s all about election year 2012, not fiscal year 2013. Don\u2019t take my word for it.  Take Harry Reid\u2019s.  The Senate majority leader \u2013 the Democrat most responsible for moving Obama\u2019s agenda through Congress \u2013 said Friday that there\u2019s no need to bring the budget to a vote this year. \u201cIt\u2019s done.  We don\u2019t need to do it,\u201d Reid said, citing spending outlines agreed to in August\u2019s debt ceiling agreement. This isn\u2019t shocking news.  It\u2019s been more than 1,000 days since the Senate passed a formal budget.  Washington governs today by lurching from one fiscal crisis to the next.  Budget plans are about drawing clear political and ideological lines between Democrats and Republicans. Obama unveils $3.8 trillion budget Voters are now less than nine months away from deciding whether Obama will have a second term.  He wants to make sure you know where he stands \u2013 sort of.  His $3.8 trillion budget, like those of Democratic and Republican predecessors alike, shines a light on what he considers to be his most popular tax and spending proposals while blurring politically painful choices that will ultimately have to be made to right our debt-laden ship of state. GOP: Obama budget 'debt on arrival' Obama: Budget requires 'tough choices' Obama: Keep progress on track Start with taxes.  Obama\u2019s plan hikes taxes on the wealthiest Americans to the tune of roughly $1.5 trillion.  It ends the Bush-era tax cuts for families making over $250,000 annually while enacting the so-called Buffett Rule, requiring households earning more than $1 million to pay at least a 30% rate. The name of the game is shared sacrifice.  The GOP-controlled House won\u2019t play along.  But you should expect to hear a lot more about it, especially if Mitt Romney wins the Republican nomination.  Romney, worth as much as $250 million, pays an effective tax rate of approximately 15%. Obama also hits a populist note by going after Wall Street fat cats.  Remember the incredibly unpopular bank bailout?  The administration\u2019s budget includes a \u201cFinancial Crisis Responsibility Fee.\u201d  The tax would raise $61 billion over the next decade from large financial institutions to help offset both the cost of the bailout and Obama\u2019s mortgage refinancing program. Assuming Republicans remain dead set against any new taxes this fall, Obama will try to hang Wall Street around the GOP\u2019s neck. The second key theme of Obama\u2019s budget: jobs now, deficit reduction later.  No president since Franklin Roosevelt has won re-election with unemployment over 7.2%.  The jobless rate is currently 8.3%, but it\u2019s going down.  Obama wants to do everything possible to keep accelerating the current trend \u2013 and get credit for doing so from the voters. In keeping with that hope, the administration is proposing to spend billions on infrastructure, education and domestic manufacturing.  Among other things, Obama\u2019s budget includes $30 billion to modernize schools, along with another $30 billion to hire and retain teachers and first responders. It also includes an extension of long-term unemployment benefits and the current payroll tax cut, something Congress is expected to take up this month. \u201cCongress needs to pass an extension of the payroll tax cut and unemployment insurance without drama and without delay and without linking it to some other ideological side issues,\u201d Obama declared Monday morning.  \u201cThe time for self-inflicted wounds to our economy has to be over.  Now is the time for action.\u201d Now is not the time, however, for new details on deficit reduction.  Obama promised to cut the deficit in half by the end of his first term.  That won\u2019t happen.  The deficit was roughly $1.4 trillion in 2009.  The White House says it will be about $1.3 trillion this year and $901 billion in 2013. The administration blames George W. Bush for the mess and insists that the deficit  will steadily decline as a percentage of the total economy over the next decade.  Critics dismiss White House projections, however, arguing that they\u2019re based on faulty growth assumptions and vague promises of future spending reductions. Specifically, critics have blasted the administration\u2019s use of $850 billion in budget \u201csavings\u201d from the end of the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan, calling the move an accounting gimmick.  They also say Obama\u2019s budget doesn\u2019t do nearly enough to control the explosive growth in politically popular entitlement programs. Money matters and the military Obama\u2019s plan outlines $360 billion in Medicare and Medicaid reductions, but those cuts come primarily to providers and don\u2019t address long-term problems tied to America\u2019s aging work force. Former GOP New Mexico Sen. Pete Domenici and former Clinton budget chief Alice Rivlin, co-chairs of a bipartisan debt reduction task force, warned Monday that the \u201creal problem\u201d with the debt begins after the next decade \u201cas entitlement costs spiral out of control and revenues are inadequate to deal with a wave of retiring baby boomers.\u201d Republicans were more blunt. \u201cIn a time of record debt, America should be spending less,\u201d said Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus.  \u201cObama\u2019s hypocrisy has taken a devastating toll on our country.  The mountain of debt weakens our economy and threatens our children\u2019s future.\u201d House Appropriations Committee Chairman Hal Rogers, R-Kentucky, said Obama\u2019s proposal \u201cfalls exceptionally short\u201d on entitlement spending reform. For his part, Obama insisted Monday that \u201cwe can\u2019t just cut our way into growth.\u201d  But over the long term, he said, \u201cthe truth is, we are going to have to make some tough choices in order to put this country back on a more sustainable fiscal path.\u201d Don\u2019t expect the truly tough choices to be outlined by either Obama or his Republican opponent this year.  Conventional wisdom says that doing so would be political suicide, and the electoral stakes are too high to challenge that belief. CNN\u2019s Tom Cohen and Charles Riley contributed to this report.",
