            "article_content": "Mother Nature, you need to calm down. There\u2019s all kinds of new extreme weather news, plus everything else\u00a0you need to know to Get Up to Speed and Out the Door. (You can also get \u201c5 Things You Need to Know Today\u201d delivered to your inbox daily. Sign up here.) We now know who\u2019s responsible for the massacre in Las Vegas and how it happened. But we may never get an answer to the most pressing question: why. Why would a 64-year-old retired accountant, with no history of violence, hole up in a casino hotel room and fire off\u00a0round after round on innocent concertgoers? The carnage is almost unspeakable \u2013 at least 59 dead and more than 500 injured. It\u2019s the deadliest mass shooting in modern American history. The\u00a0shooter, Stephen Paddock, had amassed an arsenal of 42 firearms. Twenty-three weapons, including a handgun and multiple rifles, were found in his room at the Mandalay Bay Resort and Casino. Another 19 firearms were found in his home in nearby Mesquite, Nevada. Material used to make explosives were found in his car. Authorities still think he acted alone. His brother told reporters this was totally out of character for Paddock. And now, we\u2019re learning about the victims: people like Sonny Melton, 29, a registered nurse from Tennessee, whose wife said he saved her life before he was shot, and Rachael Parker, 33, a records tech for a police department in California. Read more here about those lost too soon.\u00a0Late-night host Jimmy Kimmel got emotional talking the tragedy in his hometown and what can be done about gun violence, and Hillary Clinton tweeted, \u201cOur grief isn\u2019t enough.\u201d For the second day in a row, President Trump will be called upon to be the nation\u2019s comforter-in-chief. After striking a unifying tone during his address on the Las Vegas shooting, Trump heads today to Puerto Rico to witness storm damage from Hurricane Maria. It will be a heavy lift after Trump went after Puerto Rican officials who criticized the federal storm response. Everyone will be watching to see how the President is received on the US island. Oxfam, a global group that works to end poverty, called the administration\u2019s response \u201cslow and inadequate.\u201d\u00a0Even \u201cThe Simpsons\u201d appealed for more aid. President Trump\u2019s trip to Puerto Rico was his second chance, after his well-received address on the Las Vegas shooting, to fill the role of consoler-in-chief. It didn\u2019t go so well. During a briefing with local officials on recovery efforts, Trump seemed to downplay the devastation Hurricane Maria brought to the US territory and pumped up praise for his administration. He compared Puerto Rico\u2019s death toll to \u201ca real catastrophe, like Katrina.\u201d No, really. Later, he met with storm survivors and helped distribute supplies, at one point lobbing paper towel rolls like jump shots. CNN\u2019s Chris Cillizza says the President just doesn\u2019t have the empathy gene.\u00a0Before leaving the island, Trump, in an interview with Fox News, floated the idea of wiping out Puerto Rico\u2019s massive debt. Looks like the Russians got a lot of bang for their buck when they bought political ads on Facebook to meddle in America\u2019s elections. Facebook says about 10 million people saw at least one of the 3,000 ads bought by accounts linked to the Russian government. And it cost just $100,000 over two years to get that kind of reach. Facebook\u2019s disclosure came just hours after it\u00a0gave Congress detailed records of the ads,\u00a0Another fun fact: More than half of the ads ran after the 2016 election, and some may still be running today. A number of Russian-linked Facebook ads specifically targeted Michigan and Wisconsin, two states crucial to Donald Trump\u2019s victory last November, according to four sources with direct knowledge of the situation. Some of the Russian ads appeared highly sophisticated in their targeting of key demographic groups in areas of the states that turned out to be pivotal, two of the sources said. The ads employed a series of divisive messages aimed at breaking through the clutter of campaign ads online, including promoting anti-Muslim messages, sources said. Wells Fargo\u2019s CEO will be in the hot seat when he appears before Congress today, a little more than a year after the fake account scandal rocked the mega-bank. Tim Sloan plans to place the blame on management, according to his prepared testimony, and his predecessor, former CEO John Stumpf, for acting too slowly to head off the scandal. Wells Fargo is trying to change its broken sales culture, which gave rise to the bank opening up 3.5 million fake accounts. Sloan will almost certainly face a hostile audience on Capitol Hill. Last week, Democrat Maxine Waters said the bank should be shut down for its sins. The King of Spain is straight-up ticked off at leaders in Catalonia over the region\u2019s independence referendum. In a rare TV address, King Felipe said the referendum\u2019s organizers \u201cand their irresponsible attitude\u201d had jeopardized Spain\u2019s stability. He did not, however, mention the violence that occurred when Spanish police tried to forcibly remove people from the polls. Those clashes left nearly 900 people injured. The King\u2019s tough talk must be falling on deaf ears though, because Catalonia\u2019s leader told the BBC that the region could declare independence as early as the end of this week. Rock \u2018n\u2019 roll lovers hearts are broken at the news of the death of Tom Petty. The lead singer of Tom Petty & The Heartbreakers died after suffering cardiac arrest. Petty, 66, and his band have been\u00a0a rock radio staple, with a string of hits spanning the decades, including \u201cFree Fallin\u2019,\u201d \u201cAmerican Girl,\u201d \u201cI Won\u2019t Back Down\u201d and \u201cDon\u2019t Come Around Here No More.\u201d He was also part of the \u201980s supergroup The Traveling Wilburys. Petty\u2019s final performance was last week at the Hollywood Bowl. Uber had already dumped founder Travis Kalanick as CEO, but that apparently wasn\u2019t enough. Now, the embattled ride-share company is stripping Kalanick, who remains on Uber\u2019s board, of even more power. It did that by adding six more members to its 11-person board, reducing Kalanick\u2019s influence. Uber also now requires the board to OK a new leader by a two-thirds vote, making it much harder for Kalanick to retake his role as CEO. Uber\u2019s recent woes include lawsuits, sexism allegations and essentially being kicked out of London. 2.5 million That\u2019s how many more Americans that were affected by the massive Equifax data breach than originally thought. That brings the total number to 145.5 million people. 3 billion People are talking about these. Read up. Join in.

            "article_content": "Milo Yiannopoulos, editor at far-right Breitbart News, says he's touring colleges to fight political correctness His events have sparked protests over his inflammatory comments about women and minorities It\u2019s a recent Friday night in downtown Sacramento, and there\u2019s a man in a hotel lobby wearing a fur vest and sunglasses.  He has a British accent. A line of college-age fans stretches out the door. They\u2019re waiting for autographs and selfies. Some are wearing \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d caps. \u201cMilo I love you! Oh my god, thank you \u2013 I love what you do,\u201d says one woman to the man in the fur vest. \u201cThank you for what you\u2019re doing,\u201d says another college student wearing a Donald Trump hat. The subject of their adulation is not a rock star or a crusading politician but Milo Yiannopoulos, 32, an outspoken editor for the far-right Breitbart News. He\u2019s on a flamethrowing tour of college campuses \u2013 including an event Wednesday night at UC Berkeley that was canceled after protests became violent \u2013 and has made it his goal to take on the traditionally left-leaning college establishment. Berkeley: '150 masked agitators' ahead of Milo Yiannopoulos talk \u201cI just want to burn it down,\u201d Yiannopoulos said in an interview last month with CNN. \u201cI am speaking on college campuses because education \u2026 is really what matters. It\u2019s a crucible where these bad ideas are formed. Bad ideas like \u2026 progressive social justice, feminists, Black Lives Matter \u2026 that I think is so cancerous and toxic to free expression.\u201d This professional provocateur, who was banned on Twitter after his harassment last summer of \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d star Leslie Jones, has been making a name for himself with his \u201cDangerous Faggot\u201d bus tour. In campus appearances across the nation the openly gay Yiannopoulos has made disparaging remarks about Muslims, minority students, members of the transgender community and other groups \u2013 all in the name of free speech and the fight against political correctness. His many detractors say he is a hatemonger. But Yiannopoulos believes he offers an important perspective that is missing at universities where liberal ideas typically go unchallenged. And he\u2019s inspiring other far-right speakers to visit college campuses in the hopes of swaying young minds. \u201cPeople are tired of being told how to live, how to speak, what language they can use,\u201d he said. \u201cThe strength of feeling in my crowds, the enthusiasm for me from the audiences is the same \u2013 the same instinct, the same sort of motivating force (that) put Trump in the White House.\u201d Almost everywhere he appears, Yiannopoulos, who has started a college scholarship program open only to white male students, causes a ruckus. Last month protests erupted before his speech at the University of California, Davis, forcing sponsors to cancel the event, citing security concerns. (Yiannopoulos later led a march on campus instead.) A scheduled appearance this week at UCLA was also canceled, partly for safety reasons. On January 20, the night of Trump\u2019s inauguration, a man was shot during protests outside Yiannopoulos\u2019s event at the University of Washington in Seattle. According to the Seattle Times, Yiannopoulos briefly left the stage to confirm the shooting before returning to say, \u201cIf we don\u2019t continue, they have won.\u201d In his campus talks, Yiannopoulos spares few targets. He\u2019s gone after Black Lives Matter activists and has argued rape culture on campuses doesn\u2019t exist. He portrays white males as victims and views social justice as a form of cancer.  He has said people become feminists because they are \u201cdeeply physically unattractive.\u201d Sometimes Yiannopoulos mocks individual people. While talking about the transgender bathroom debate at the University of Wisconsin-Milwaukee in December, he displayed a photo of a transgender female student from that school and told the crowd, \u201cthe way that you know he\u2019s failing is that I\u2019d almost still bang him.\u201d Breitbart editor starts scholarship for just white men He\u2019s also implied Americans have good reason to fear Muslims and said that liberals believe that they can make Muslims accept gays if only they \u201chug them hard enough. Well, news flash ladies, it\u2019s not a boner, it\u2019s a bomb.\u201d Yiannopoulos is typically invited to speak by conservative student organizations such as College Republicans and Turning Point USA.  He claims he charges no speaking fees and that his travel expenses are paid for by Breitbart News and wealthy donors. A handful of people also have started GoFundMe pages to cover the costs of hiring extra security for his events. Tickets usually sell out fast. Some fans show up in suits and ties. Others wear Trump hats and T-shirts, making the event feel like a campaign rally even though the election is long over. Outside the halls, the spectacle sometimes includes police in riot gear and crowds of anti-Milo demonstrators chanting \u201cNo Trump, no KKK, no fascist USA!\u201d Yiannopoulos, who recently signed a reported $250,000 book deal, appears unfazed. \u201c[College students] understand that there\u2019s something exciting and dissident and mischievous about this,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s almost cool to be Republican now.\u201d Yiannopoulos is often identified with the alt-right, a far-right political movement rife with white nationalist, anti-Semitic and racist ideologies, although he rejects the label. His tour has coincided with a flurry of hate crimes around the country following Trump\u2019s election victory \u2013 many of them on college campuses. In the month after the election, the Southern Poverty Law Center said 172 hate incidents were reported at colleges and universities nationwide. The SPLC attributes the spread of alt-right propaganda on campus to the \u201cincreased confidence that these groups are feeling following Trump\u2019s victory,\u201d which they say is also being fueled by figures like Yiannopoulos and white nationalist Richard Spencer. \u201cWhat\u2019s new is Donald Trump. There\u2019s somebody on the national stage who\u2019s \u2026 helping to encourage and give enthusiasm to this effort to proselytize and go to campuses and get new recruits for a new conservative movement,\u201d said Kevin Johnson, dean of the law school at UC Davis. Universities have faced pressure to cancel Yiannopoulos\u2019 events. But many have decided to allow his show to go on in the name of free speech and the First Amendment. \u201cWe\u2019re a public university, bound by the US Constitution. And we\u2019re not supposed to be censoring speech so it\u2019s not really up to us to say who can say what on campus,\u201d said Johnson of UC Davis. \u201cIn our view, Mr. Yiannopoulos is a troll and provocateur who uses odious behavior in part to \u2018entertain,\u2019 but also to deflect any serious engagement with ideas,\u201d added Chancellor Nicholas Dirks of UC Berkeley, in explaining why the university allowed his event to be held on campus. But, he added, \u201cwe are defending the right to free expression at an historic moment for our nation, when this right is once again of paramount importance. In this context, we cannot afford to undermine those rights, and feel a need to make a spirited defense of the principle of tolerance, even when it means we tolerate that which may appear to us as intolerant.\u201d Milo Yiannopoulos protesters burn confederate flag as quiet crowd and officer from rooftop watch #MiloYiannopoulos #calpoly pic.twitter.com/HRO3RlQ0gx But some students who end up as the targets of Yiannopoulos\u2019s comments feel there should be no place for him or his views on campus. A transgender UC Davis student, who asked to be identified only as Barbara, told CNN she was too scared to be on campus during Yiannopoulos\u2019s scheduled visit and was fearful of his potential effect on her classmates. \u201cThe fear is with the folks who are gonna see him,\u201d she said. \u201cHe leaves. But the folks who are attending (his event) are the folks that I have to sit next to in classrooms.\u201d Yiannopoulos isn\u2019t the only controversial speaker to try and capitalize on what some are describing as a \u201chate speech as free speech\u201d movement. Spencer, the white nationalist, told Mother Jones that watching one of Yiannopoulos\u2019s speeches at the University of Houston in September was a \u201chuge inspiration\u201d and helped him realize \u201cwhat we are doing is known to people, it\u2019s edgy and dangerous, it\u2019s cool and hip. It\u2019s that thing our parents don\u2019t want us to do.\u201d Spencer spoke at Texas A&M University in December and says he\u2019s planning to do his own college tour. Nathan Damigo, another white nationalist and founder of a group called Identity Europa, says he\u2019s hoping to join Spencer on the tour. Damigo says he also sees Yiannopoulos as an inspiration and showed up at his event at UC Davis before it was canceled, hoping to find potential recruits for his own cause. \u201cIn a way, we\u2019re all trying to do the same thing,\u201d Damigo told CNN. \u201cWe\u2019re all trying to bring narratives to these institutions that have been intentionally omitted. We are trying to combat the (liberal) narratives here that are just being allowed to propagate here without any sort of confrontations.\u201d For his part, Yiannopoulos says he has nothing to do with Spencer or any white nationalists. \u201cI don\u2019t have unsavory opinions about skin color \u2026 what you are seeking to do, by associating me with people who have odious and disgusting opinions, is suggest that I somehow in some way tacitly enable these people,\u201d he said. \u201cI don\u2019t. F*ck you.\u201d But Oren Segal, director of the Anti-Defamation League\u2019s Center on Extremism, believes Yiannopoulos \u201cserves as a gateway\u201d to more dangerous ideas. \u201cWhen you see white supremacists hanging outside of Milo\u2019s events to poach potential recruits, it speaks to exactly why Milo is potentially dangerous. Milo is bringing his misogyny and hatred and racism onto campus, and people (are) sort of maybe considering it, \u2018Oh, this is just ironic. He\u2019s just being \u2013 you know, pushing the envelope.\u2019\u201d Segal said. \u201cAnd so it enables his ideology, his messages to sort of seep in. The next level is maybe an openness to more white supremacist ideas, more hardcore believers. I think that\u2019s fundamentally dangerous.\u201d But Yiannopoulos said he doesn\u2019t believe his statements are that far from the mainstream. He sees himself as a crusader for free speech. \u201cI have opinions that, frankly, a lot of people are thinking. They just won\u2019t tell people. They don\u2019t pollsters. They don\u2019t tell journalists. But they think it, which is why you\u2019re all so surprised when, you know, half the country voted for Trump. I hold perfectly respectable, reasonable opinions that half of America agrees with,\u201d he said. \u201cSo long as people are prevented from saying true things in public life for political correctness, there\u2019ll still be a need for me,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd I\u2019ll never stop.\u201d CNN\u2019s Brandon Griggs contributed to this story.",

            "article_content": "John Legend slammed West's meeting with Trump as a \"publicity stunt\" Rapper ASAP Ferg voiced support for West, calling his \"strategic not stupid\" Kanye West doesn\u2019t seem fazed by the backlash levied against him by fans and friends for meeting with President-elect Donald Trump. A day after the hip-hop mogul\u2019s meeting with Trump at Trump Tower in New York, West on Wednesday tweeted a signed copy of TIME Magazine\u2019s \u201cPerson of the Year\u201d issue with Trump on the cover. \u201cTo Kanye You are a great friend Thanks,\u201d the front cover reads, followed by Trump\u2019s signature. This is the latest sign that West has some sort of admiration for the President-elect and is ready to work with him on issues that the rapper cares about, particularity the poverty and the violence that have plagued his native Chicago. West tweeted that the meeting, which was requested by the rapper, was an opportunity for the rapper to discuss \u201cmulticultural issues.\u201d \u201cThese issues included bullying, supporting teachers, modernizing curriculums, and violence in Chicago,\u201d West tweeted. \u201cI feel it is important to have a direct line of communication with our future President if we truly want change,\u201d he added. West, who famously accused President George W. Bush in 2005 of not caring about black people, shocked fans in California last month when he abruptly ended a concert with a rant in which he proclaimed that had he voted, he would have voted for Trump. Hip-hop braces for a Trump presidency \u201cI told y\u2019all I didn\u2019t vote, right?\u201d Kanye said. \u201cBut if I would\u2019ve voted, I would\u2019ve voted for Trump.\u201d John Legend, who has been signed to West\u2019s label G.O.O.D. Music since 2004, slammed the meeting in an interview with French outlet \u201cClique\u201d and said that West allowed Trump to use him as a \u201cpublicity stunt.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m pretty disappointed with Kanye that he says he would have voted for Trump. I think Trump has been corrosive, his message has been corrosive to the country,\u201d Legend said. Legend and his wife, model Chrissy Teigen, were outspoken supporters of Hillary Clinton throughout the 2016 election. \ud83d\ude24\ud83d\ude24\ud83d\ude24\ud83d\ude24 pic.twitter.com/Mye6JDYqe1 Rapper YG, who became an outspoken Trump critic in 2016, tweeted a photo of West\u2019s meeting with Trump with angry emojis. \u201cBlack Lives Matter\u201d activist Deray Mckesson also lamented the meeting, slamming Trump for having conversations with black celebrities as opposed to black media and activists. Even more random than Kanye with Trump today was Ray Lewis. Omarosa has to dig deep to find black people to validate Trump. Meanwhile, rapper ASAP Ferg voiced support for West\u2019s decision to meet with Trump, calling the rapper\u2019s move \u201cstrategic not stupid.\u201d i think @kanyewest is smarter than we think he is , he's getting closer to trump so he can get more insight of his plans!!! ur take ? I think @kanyewest was right today for meeting up with trump !!! You need to know where this man head is at !!! He rules your nation \u201cI think @kanyewest was right today for meeting up with trump !!! You need to know where this man head is at !!! He rules your nation,\u201d the rapper tweeted. West, who famously declared a 2020 presidential bid during a bizarre rant at the 2015 MTV VMA\u2019s, followed up his tweets about the meeting with a tweet that simply reads \u201c#2024\u201d \u2013 apparently removing the possibility he would run against Trump were he to seek re-election in four years.",

            "article_content": "\u201cI\u2019ll never forget it,\u201d Clemie Burks said when asked to describe how she felt when Sen. Barack Obama took the oath of office on a frigid day in Washington. Nearly eight years later and 1,000 miles away in this Mississippi Delta town, Burks, a 57-year-old native seemed to swell with pride when she talked about her president, who would not be president much longer. \u201cI was so proud. I think I jumped and hollered and cried and prayed and said, \u2018Ooh, we have finally made it,\u2019 she told me in a recent interview in her living room after she got off work from her nursing job, still dressed in her scrubs. \u201cIt\u2019s a day I never thought I would see.\u201d For Burks and many other African Americans, Obama\u2019s legacy is more than political \u2013 it is personal, and gave them the ability to see themselves in places they never had before. That was especially true here in the Delta, where the DNA of this town reflects some of Mississippi\u2019s fraught history. Old railroad tracks divide the city in two, separating the predominantly black east side of the city from the more affluent, whiter west side. Last year, six decades after the US Supreme Court declared that \u201cseparate but equal\u201d had no place in the nation\u2019s public schools, a federal judge ruled that Cleveland\u2019s schools must desegregate and that the town\u2019s middle and high schools must consolidate. Still, people here are proud of their history. Sen. Robert Kennedy traveled here in 1967 to measure the effectiveness of the so-called War on Poverty. A nearby park is named for Amzie Moore, a local son turned civil rights leader. Dockery Plantation, just outside of Cleveland city limits, is the home of the famed singer Charley Patton and known around here as the birthplace of the blues. Over lunches and dinners, on the streets during a parade honoring the achievements of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., in churches and in classrooms, black residents of Cleveland counted down the final days of Obama\u2019s presidency with admiration and looked skeptically toward a future under President Trump. \u201cThe problem with Obama was he had so many challenges and they expected so much from him and he couldn\u2019t achieve everything they wanted him to achieve,\u201d Burks said. \u201cEven in his trying \u2013 and he failed in some of the things \u2013 he\u2019s my giant.\u201d She is not alone. A recent Pew Research Center survey found that 62% of African Americans ranked Obama\u2019s election as the most significant historical event in their lifetime. Blacks from across the country flocked to DC in 2009 to see the nation\u2019s first black president sworn in. Willie Simmons, a Democratic state senator who owns a local homestyle restaurant was one of them. \u201cIt seemed like everybody in America either was there or wanted to be there,\u201d Simmons told me in an interview at The Senator\u2019s Place, the restaurant he\u2019s owned for more than two decades. Simmons described the change he felt happen when Obama was inaugurated; where there were once institutional barriers, there was now possibility. \u201cAlthough the founding fathers basically said all men are created equal and indicated that we could become President of the United States if we wanted to, many of us never felt that we could,\u201d he said. \u201cSo to be able to be part of that celebration and watch Obama be sworn in as president is [a feeling] that you will never forget.\u201d Simmons wasn\u2019t always on team Obama though. During the 2008 primary, he supported Hillary Clinton because she believed she stood a better chance at winning, a decision that caused him to \u201close a lot of friends\u201d and be \u201cjumped on by many.\u201d \u201cOne threatened to put me out of the family,\u201d he said with a laugh, alluding to a political rift between him and an older brother. \u201cPresident Obama proved to us that a young community worker out of Chicago Illinois\u2026could become president of the United States. In the future, we\u2019ll see another President Obama and we\u2019ll see a female become president of the United States also.\u201d The president himself sounded the same notes at his final presidential press conference this week. He was asked by April Ryan, the White House correspondent for American Urban Radio Network, whether he expected the country to see another black president. His answer? Not just black presidents, but all kinds of presidents. \u201cI think we\u2019re going to see people of merit rise up from every race, faith, corner of this country. Because that\u2019s America\u2019s strength,\u201d he responded. \u201cWhen we have everybody getting a chance and everybody\u2019s on the field, we end up being better.\u201d Later in the afternoon, The Senator\u2019s Place was filled with a throng of hungry black families, many in their Sunday finery after attending the day\u2019s Martin Luther King Day celebrations. A serpentine line of hungry folks wrapped around the perimeter of the restaurant as others chowed down from plates heaped high with fried chicken, turnip greens, candied yams and rice and gravy \u2013 all for $8. One of them was Sassy Smith-Taylor, a 20-year old mass communications student at Mississippi Valley State University, a historically black college situated nearly 40 miles away in Itta Bena, Mississippi. Smith-Taylor grew up in Dallas but told me she was drawn to the small campus because of its tight-knit feel, something she said is emblematic of the entire Delta. \u201cThere is only one word that I think can describe the Mississippi Delta to the fullest extent and that\u2019s love,\u201d she said. \u201cEvery street\u2026that you walk on has history to it. The college is about 15 miles down the highway from where Emmett Till was murdered, so there\u2019s a lot of hard history, but through all that, they still have the most positive people and the most loving people. You never meet a stranger.\u201d Smith-Taylor was just 12 years old when Obama was sworn into office and said she didn\u2019t initially realize the gravity of the moment. \u201cI don\u2019t think it hit me, the impact he would have on our community as an African-American woman, and especially for our country as a whole,\u201d she recalled. \u201cBeing a kid, it let me know that not only can I have white friends and friends of different nationalities, but I\u2019m also able to have the opportunity to become a president one day if I choose to.\u201d She described Obama\u2019s legacy of one of \u201chope, change and opportunity,\u201d but also said that the outgoing president faced unprecedented challenges while in office because he was a black man. She remembered when Rep. Joe Wilson, a white lawmaker, shouted \u201cyou lie!\u201d during an address before a joint session of Congress. She recalled social media posts that referred to Obama\u2019s 2009 swearing-in as the \u201cinniggeration,\u201d and political opponents who she believes have opposed Obama\u2019s policies simply because he is black. \u201cThe way he handled that with such class\u2026.he never fired back with mean or ugly jabs,\u201d she said. \u201cHe just continued\u2026to strive to make this country as best as it could be.\u201d Obama gave many here in the Mississippi Delta a freedom to dream. But at the same time, the upcoming inauguration of President-elect Trump \u2013 a man who at times seemed to run on a platform of that energized open racists \u2013 seemed to replace the eight-year-old promise of \u201chope and change\u201d with a mix of mistrust, anger and fear. \u201cExpectations? I don\u2019t have any,\u201d Arlene Sanders, a professor at Delta State University said of Trump. \u201cPresident-elect Trump says he\u2019s going to create jobs, improve the infrastructure. That was one of President Obama\u2019s goals\u2026and Republicans didn\u2019t agree. Here, President-elect Trump says the same thing and everybody thinks it\u2019s such a bold new idea.\u201d She paused and pursed her lips. \u201cNot expecting much, here in the heart of the Mississippi Delta.\u201d Smith-Taylor, the college student, wouldn\u2019t openly trash the incoming president, but suggested that some of his rhetoric surrounding blacks, Muslims and other people of color was troubling. She wanted to look forward. \u201cThe only way that you can go against some of the things that [Trump] has said and some of the things that he is done is to continue to show the world that, as Americans, we are not ugly. We do not hate one another,\u201d she said. \u201cThat\u2019s not what we do. America is love.\u201d Leroy Byars coached the football team at Cleveland\u2019s East Side High School for more than a decade before serving as the school\u2019s principal from 1988 to 1997. He\u2019s so revered that the school\u2019s football field bears his name. Now retired, Byars still lives in Cleveland, a place he says that has its \u201cbattles\u201d but is still \u201cone of the most opportune places to live.\u201d Byars predicted that under President-elect Trump, the country is in for a \u201crocky time.\u201d \u201cBeing a leader of a nation is a lot different from being a multi-millionaire and running your own business,\u201d he told me. \u201cYou\u2019re representing all the people of the United States of America. You have to act accordingly.\u201d I asked him if he thought Trump could represent people of color. \u201cSome of the statements that he\u2019s made? I don\u2019t know,\u201d Byars said before pausing. \u201cI have my doubts.\u201d Burks, the 57-year-old nurse, put it more bluntly: \u201c[For] Trump to come behind Obama is a total disaster,\u201d she said flatly. \u201cTrump is a fool.\u201d Trump, she said, sold voters in some parts of the country a false bill of goods. \u201cWe\u2019ve just got a road ahead of us, a long road ahead of us. I\u2019m hoping that we can change some things,\u201d she added later. \u201cSometimes, after 50 years and things haven\u2019t changed, sometimes you give up hope. But being a Christian, being a lady from the South, that\u2019s all we have\u2026is Jesus.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Carrie Sheffield is the executive director of Generation Opportunity, a project of the grassroots advocacy group Americans for Prosperity, founded by Charles and David Koch and funded by conservative and libertarian donors. The opinions expressed in this commentary are her own. Carrie Sheffield: The House and Senate tax bills take steps to right the inequity of the current tax system Under the current tax code, lobbying is rewarded over hard work, and low-tax states are left subsidizing high-tax states When I was little, my family spent some time on public assistance. So I learned at a young age that the best way to lift people out of poverty and into the middle class is to expand economic opportunity. Creating well-paying jobs allows for the social mobility that is often unattainable for families when they are dependent on government assistance. People thrive with the dignity of self-reliance. The US tax code works against this principle. Instead of rewarding hard work and entrepreneurship, the tax code rewards lobbying and \u201crent-seeking.\u201d Instead of instilling a sense of fair play, it is justifiably viewed by tens of millions of Americans as rigged against them. This has led to a majority of citizens favoring major changes to tax laws. The tax code is built upon bad fiscal policy, which is, needless to say, bad for the nation. We have to find a better way to operate. On Thursday, the House passed a tax reform bill, and the Senate has advanced its own tax proposal, both of which would be a big step toward remedying some of these ills. In different ways, the House and Senate bills would cut back on the deductibility of state and local taxes (SALT). This provision has generated some strong pushback, but let\u2019s consider what this means for a minute. The deduction for state and local taxes is an advantage for a subset of a subset. According to 2014 data, only about 30% of taxpayers, generally wealthier ones, itemize their deductions. And even for that minority the SALT deduction\u2019s value is uneven, since residents of high-tax states like California and New York get a bigger deduction on their federal taxes than those living in low-tax states. This effectively means high tax states are taking a larger cut from the federal government than low-tax states. Dear senators: Don't bankrupt our country How is it fair that residents of low-tax states are left subsidizing the bad choices made by lawmakers in other states? Why should two people with similar incomes and similar life situations who live perhaps miles apart near a state line be treated so differently? The answer, of course, is politics. At roughly 4 million words, the tax code is all but undecipherable. According to the Small Business Administration, many small business owners who do their own taxes spend more than 40 hours every year preparing and filing their federal tax returns. Many small businesses hire somebody to do it, another cost burden. The National Taxpayer Advocate, an independent organization within the IRS, found that complying with the code costs American taxpayers $195 billion a year. Small businesses alone spend between $15 and $16 billion a year on compliance costs, according to the National Federation of Independent Business. Talk about immoral. That\u2019s time parents could be spending with their kids. That\u2019s money small business owners could be investing in their stores, their employees, their futures. Then there\u2019s the unfairness of it. Big businesses have even bigger challenges, but they can afford to hire lawyers and accountants to navigate the tax code (and lobbyists to help get legislation written in their favor). The tax code is a treasure trove of subsidies, handouts and breaks for those well-connected enough to get them. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that tax expenditures, including preferential tax rates, credits, special exclusions, exemptions, and deductions, will exceed $1.5 trillion this year alone. GOP's double whammy against the middle class What we\u2019re left with is a two-tiered system in which some are the movers and shakers, and the rest of us are just left shaking with rage at the injustice of it all. Will either the Senate or House tax reform measures fix all these problems? Of course not. What legislation ever solved a problem completely? Deals are cut, compromises are necessary, politics continues to be played. But both bills include provisions that constitute an improvement over the status quo. Lower rates on individuals mean more money in the pockets of taxpayers, and corporate rate cuts benefit everybody. These reforms should not be viewed as \u201ctax cuts for the rich.\u201d Instead, they are tax cuts that enrich us all.  These bills aren\u2019t perfect. But lawmakers are making progress toward overhauling a system defined by this sorry sentiment: 72% of Americans polled on Election Day 2016 said \u201cthe American economy is rigged to advantage the rich and powerful.\u201d Bitter partisanship should not preclude Washington from doing the right thing and fixing the unfairness that permeates the tax code. It\u2019s time to move away from a convoluted and arcane system that discourages economic growth and baffles most of us, toward a simpler, fairer system that creates opportunity for all.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Tanzina Vega covers race and inequality for CNN Money. Follow her on Twitter @tanzinavega. The opinions expressed in this commentary are her own. Tanzina Vega writes that politicians and the media show support for the white working class as it confronts economic and health challenges She says they often continue to demonize black and Hispanic people who suffer from the same or even greater woes In the 1890s, sociologist W.E.B. Du Bois noticed something disturbing about how Americans viewed the plight of blacks in Philadelphia who had suffered through unsanitary living conditions, high rates of consumption and back-breaking labor. \u201cThe most difficult social problem in the matter of Negro health is the peculiar attitude of the nation toward the well-being of the race,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThere have, for instance, been few other cases in the history of civilized peoples where human suffering has been viewed with such peculiar indifference.\u201d That indifference toward the well-being of blacks, and to a larger extent, people of color in the United States, arguably continues today, particularly in how the media frames the struggles of whites who are suffering from suicide and drug abuse at record rates. President Donald Trump won his campaign, in part, on the promise of bringing hope back to \u201cthe silent majority,\u201d a large swath of mainly white working-class Americans who feel they have been left behind by trade policies like NAFTA and have watched their manufacturing jobs disappear. But the administration\u2019s rhetoric about blacks, Muslims and Latinos has focused mostly on crime in the \u201cinner cities,\u201d \u201ccriminal aliens\u201d attacking native-born Americans and \u201cradical Islamic terrorism\u201d as the scourge of our nation. The economic anxiety facing black and brown workers, while arguably more profound, has been largely sidelined. In a CNN/Kaiser poll taken before the election, 63% of white working-class respondents said they were satisfied with their personal financial situation, compared to just 40% of black working-class respondents. Both groups were overwhelmingly dissatisfied with the country\u2019s economic situation. Researchers at Princeton University recently found that whites without a college degree, many of whom are saddled with high unemployment, consumed with addiction and with the fabric of their families fraying, are killing themselves in so-called \u201cdeaths of despair.\u201d Yet, by most measures, whites are still better off than black and brown Americans \u2013 they have more wealth on average and they are likely to be paid more, even with less experience and education than their black counterparts. In 2013, white households in the US had a median wealth of $144,200 \u2013 almost 13 times the median wealth of black households at $11,200. And the CNN/Kaiser poll showed that while 19% of whites without a college degree had earned more than $90,000 in income, just 6% of blacks without a college degree had earned that level of income. Even though the poverty gap between blacks and whites has narrowed, a Pew study released last year found that blacks were still at least twice as likely as whites to live in poverty or be unemployed. Blacks were also more likely to have sought food from a food bank than whites were. Today\u2019s empathy gap in how we view white poverty and black poverty is partly the result of the overwhelming, and arguably sympathetic, focus on white working-class Americans by both the media and the current administration. Consider the popularity of the podcast \u201cS-Town,\u201d where \u201crace has a weird, sideways manner of appearing,\u201d among its poor, white protagonists, wrote Wesley Jenkins for Buzzfeed. An empathy gap also exists in how we view the opioid addiction crisis that has gripped the nation, particularly among white males. I recall growing up in public housing in New York City and seeing heroin and crack ravage our largely poor black and Latino community. Back then, the drug epidemic was considered a crime to be eradicated, rather than a public health issue to be handled with compassion. To be sure, poor white Americans are facing a serious crisis, but blacks who still lag far behind them in key metrics of economic success, are rarely seen as deserving of such empathy. \u201cMost Americans believe that racism is in the past and that it\u2019s individual, not structural,\u201d said David R. Williams, a professor of public health, African-American studies and sociology at Harvard University. \u201cThey believe that the problems minority Americans have are problems they created themselves.\u201d Cummings: I told Trump about real inner cities The racialization of poverty in the media began to take shape in the 1970s and 80s, when blacks became the face of government assistance programs like welfare, said Charlton McIlwain, an associate professor of media, culture and communication at New York University. Previous government programs like The New Deal were meant to help poor white Americans \u201cwho had lost their economic way\u201d and were struggling after the Great Depression, said McIlwain. Contrast that with Ronald Regan\u2019s oft-invoked trope of the \u201cwelfare queen,\u201d the black woman who supposedly leeches off of the government for her own needs and \u201cblack poverty had come to be seen as associated with laziness, criminality and violence\u201d said McIlwain. For whites, poverty is a \u201cfailure of the system,\u201d with a narrative that says, \u201cYou\u2019ve done all you can, you\u2019ve worked hard and here you are with no safety net,\u201d said McIlwain. Blacks and other people of color are viewed as \u201cgetting what they deserve for being lazy, for being criminals, for not picking themselves up by their bootstraps.\u201d Empathy gaps exist beyond poverty, too. Studies have shown black men are often perceived as bigger, stronger and scarier than white men, even if they are the same size. And additional research has shown that black boys are seen as older and less innocent than their white counterparts. Criminal justice is also rife with empathy gaps. Blacks are more likely to be wrongfully convicted than whites and are also likely to spend longer in prison before being exonerated for their crimes. In her play \u201cSweat,\u201d Pulitzer Prize winner Lynn Nottage examines the town of Reading, Pennsylvania, which lost its manufacturing plant in the early 2000s and the jobs that came with it. Suddenly, white and black residents who once had solid working-class lives and middle-class aspirations find themselves confronting poverty, drug addiction, incarceration \u2013 and each other. \u201cWhite poverty is seen as different, even though there\u2019s a certain swath of the population that\u2019s been experiencing a certain level of deprivation for a very long time,\u201d Nottage told me in a brief interview after a recent performance of the play. Nottage leans in to questions about race and class when one of the characters, a Latino bar back, crosses the picket line to work at the plant for less than the union workers make but more than his current job pays. In another scene, a black woman gets promoted to management, much to the chagrin of her white co-workers. Both characters defend their positions in economic terms: they need the money because black and brown workers have historically been kept out of higher paying jobs. Despite their documented advantages, data from the General Social Survey at the University of Chicago show that over the past few decades whites have grown increasingly less optimistic than blacks about their ability to improve their standard of living. In 2016, 53% of whites said they were optimistic about their prospects, compared to 62% of blacks. (In 1987, 73% of whites said they were optimistic about their ability to improve their standard of living compared to 67% of blacks.)  Pessimism among whites appears to have increased around the Great Recession, said Jennifer Benz, a principal research scientist and the deputy director of The Associated Press-NORC Center for Public Affairs Research. While the recession \u201chit blacks worse than it hit whites,\u201d Benz said, whites may have felt that they \u201cwere falling from a higher place.\u201d Closing the empathy gap will not come easy. \u201cThe empathy gap exists because whites frequently lack any real connection to nonwhites and therefore don\u2019t see them as \u2018one of us\u2019,\u201d said McIllwain of NYU. Moving past that \u201crequires deep engagement with people at the personal and community level.\u201d But our country\u2019s continued segregation in schools, workplaces and religious institutions will make that a challenge, said McIlwain. Instead, we could focus on fairness in how our institutions treat black and white Americans, said McIlwain. Lawmakers, police officers, and judges must be willing to correct disparities in arrests, incarceration, sentencing and funding for drug treatment. \u201cThen they must ask themselves what role they may have played in contributing to those disparities, and then be willing to correct that which is in our power,\u201d said McIlwain. \u201cThis takes less empathy than it does sheer will.\u201d",

            "article_content": "CNN Special Report \u201cAfter O.J.: The Fuhrman Tapes Revealed,\u201d airing at 11 p.m. ET Friday, uncovers never-before-heard excerpts from the tapes that rocked the \u201ctrial of the century.\u201d When people think of O.J. Simpson, many remember The Chase. That\u2019s when Simpson and his friend Al Cowlings led police on a surreal slow-speed chase in a white Ford Bronco as crowds lined a Los Angeles freeway to cheer them on. I think instead of The Moment. It was a sunny autumn day on October 3, 1995, and I had gathered with others in an Atlanta food court to watch the Simpson verdict on TV. When it was announced, there was a squeal of delight from the African-Americans in the crowd. They high-fived one another and pumped their fists. But all the white people were shocked. Looks of anger and jaw-dropping disbelief flashed across their faces. That\u2019s when I realized: So many Americans could look at the same event and absorb the same facts \u2013 but come to totally different conclusions. We\u2019ve been having more O.J. moments ever since. It\u2019s become the norm. On Thursday, Simpson won parole after serving nearly nine years of a nine-to-33-year sentence for kidnapping and armed robbery at a Las Vegas hotel. But Simpson, of course, is defined by another crime: his 1995 acquittal in the grisly murders of his ex-wife Nicole Brown Simpson and her friend Ron Goldman. O.J. Simpson wins parole after serving nine years for armed robbery and kidnapping https://t.co/di9NLhRSI6 https://t.co/G3ECaWR0u2 Like many, I feel like I\u2019ve overdosed on O.J. I\u2019m tired of hearing the name. What more can be said about him? When I called a professor to discuss Simpson, her first reaction was an exasperated \u201cOh, Lord Jesus!\u201d But I think there are still two small things O.J. can teach us about ourselves. One is how The Moment led to Other Moments. Before there was fake news, there was fake DNA, and other alternative facts surrounding Simpson\u2019s trial. Only two months ago, a police officer soberly informed me that Mexican drug dealers had set up Simpson for the slayings. Why am I still surprised by that? I shouldn\u2019t be \u2013 we keep on having these O.J. moments. We do it with race. Notice how Donald Trump Jr. was described after he was criticized for meeting with a Russian lawyer and former Russian intelligence officer who promised dirt on Hillary Clinton. The 39-year-old son of the President was described as a na\u00efve \u201ckid,\u201d says Carol Anderson, author of  \u201cWhite Rage\u201d and a professor of African-American studies at Atlanta\u2019s Emory University. Compare that to how a police dispatcher described Tamir Rice, the 12-year-old black child who was shot to death in 2015 by Cleveland police. A man calling 911 described a \u201cguy\u201d pointing a gun at people. Others looking at the video saw a boy playing with a toy gun in a public park, Anderson says. \u201cDonald Trump Jr. is described as a young kid and 12-year-old Tamir Rice was described as 21-year-old and threatening,\u201d Anderson says. We do it with gender. O.J. Simpson granted parole after 9 years in prison When a tape was released during the 2016 election of then-candidate Donald Trump making vulgar remarks, some saw a middle-aged white man bragging about sexually assaulting women \u2013 while others saw a man engaging in some unwise but harmless locker room talk. Those kinds of gender clashes have migrated to popular culture. Anderson cites how fans reacted to the recent news that the next incarnation of the BBC\u2019s \u201cDr. Who\u201d would be a woman instead of a man. \u201cThink about the backlash,\u201d she says. \u201cI\u2019ve been seeing all of these tweets to \u2018Dr. Whore.\u201d\u2019 We do it in so many other ways. Same facts, different reality. You say global warming; I say no proof. You say Black Lives Matter; I say White Lives Matter. The O.J. moment was just a prelude to our new normal. But what if that\u2019s not bad, but something good? Could that be the second lesson O.J. has to teach us? There\u2019s nostalgia for an America when we had fewer O.J. moments. Some remember how the \u201cgreatest generation\u201d fought World War II, or how the country came together in the wake of September 11. We seemed to share the same reality and speak with the same voice. Yet suppose that speaking with once voice is actually dangerous, and that the O.J. moment reveals something that\u2019s right about America? That\u2019s what Shayne Lee remembers. A black New Yorker, he was attending a conservative white college in Virginia when the verdict was announced. He, too, was surrounded by whites and blacks who reacted in starkly different ways. He loved it. O.J. Simpson's rise and fall, from football star to prisoner \u201cThe beauty of America is that we can have all of these fragmented voices and they can be different from each other and not be worried about being thrown in jail,\u201d he says. \u201cWhen I look at Saudi Arabia, I\u2019ll take America every day.\u201d Lee, a sociologist at the University of Houston, says the goal of \u201ctrue democracy\u201d is to \u201cgive voices to different perspectives.\u201d Arguments, clashing points of view, raised voices \u2013 that\u2019s democracy working. \u201cLook at the Nazis,\u201d he says. \u201cThey were ruled by one point of view.\u201d Even the reaction to the O.J. verdict was more multidimensional than people realize, he says. Some of the African-Americans he was with that day thought Simpson was innocent, while others still celebrated even though they thought he was guilty. \u201cThey were saying, \u2018Rich white men have gotten off for crimes, I\u2019m just so happy now to see a rich black man get off,\u2019\u201d he says. \u201cThere were even multiple perspectives among the people who celebrated.\u201d Still, how do you keep a country together when there is no shared sense of reality? Lee says the key is for people to \u201cwalk a mile in the moccasins of people who are different.\u201d It\u2019s why he demands his students argue for a point of view they don\u2019t agree with. It\u2019s why he invited a Nation of Islam member to speak to a class filled with whites, blacks, Muslims, Jews, Nigerians and Latinos. \u201cHe told me afterward that lecturing to your class was like lecturing before the United Nations,\u201d Lee says. There may be those who say Simpson only revealed what\u2019s wrong with America. I\u2019m not so sure. I now imagine how awful it would have been to live in a place where everyone staring at those TV screens in 1995 felt compelled to react as one when Simpson\u2019s verdict was announced. Would that be the United States of America? Or North Korea? The rise and fall of O.J. Simpson It\u2019s not easy living in a world that the O.J. moment created. It\u2019s even more difficult in a time when social media is rampant. Imagine how the O.J. trial would have been treated on Facebook and Twitter. Perhaps, though, the tumult, raised blood pressure and cries of fake news are better than the alternative. It was the jazz trumpeter Wynton Marsalis who once gave one of the best descriptions I\u2019ve ever heard of America and democracy. America isn\u2019t easy listening music \u2013 uniform, predictable, always pleasant to the ear. We are jazz. \u201cJazz means working things out musically with other people. You have to listen to other musicians and play with them even if you don\u2019t agree with what they\u2019re playing. It teaches you the very opposite of racism and anti-Semitism. It teaches you that the world is big enough to accommodate us all.\u201d And if you still think competing voices sound like noise in this post-O.J. era, there is at least one consolation we take as Simpson tries to move on. No matter where he goes or what he does, people won\u2019t be cheering him like they did when he was an NFL star or an actor. He\u2019s lost two pillars of support: Hollywood and the black community. No more Hertz commercials for O.J. Black preachers and civil rights leaders no longer defend him. Friends quoted Simpson as once saying, \u201cI\u2019m not black, I\u2019m O.J.\u201d One of the grim jokes in the black community is that Simpson became black for the first and only time during his trial. At last, there appears to be something we can all agree on: Nobody likes O.J.",

            "article_content": "NEW: A teacher who advised the yearbook staff has been suspended pending the result of an investigation New Jersey parents are complaining their kids' support for Donald Trump was erased from a high school yearbook When Grant Berardo, a junior at Wall Township High School in Wall, New Jersey, recently opened his yearbook, he noticed something different about the T-shirt he was wearing in his school photo. The \u201cTRUMP: Make America Great Again\u201d lettering on his shirt had been digitally removed. \u201cHe was disappointed. This was the first election he has been interested in,\u201d said Grant\u2019s father, Joseph Berardo. Now the school is facing accusations of censorship, a teacher has been suspended and the parents of three students are looking for answers \u2013 and new yearbooks. \u201cI want the yearbooks to be reissued and I want a letter from the administration explaining why they are reissuing the yearbook,\u201d Joseph Berardo said. Before the high school\u2019s picture day last fall, Berardo said he and his wife talked to Grant about wearing the shirt and agreed that \u201cas long as the shirt didn\u2019t have drugs or alcohol on it was fine.\u201d When the Berardos got the photo proofs in November, the Trump logo was there and they approved use of the photo in the yearbook. But when the yearbooks were released this spring, the TRUMP logo was gone. And Grant\u2019s wasn\u2019t the only student\u2019s photo to be altered. A Donald Trump logo also was missing from junior Wyatt Dobrovich-Fago\u2019s vest. And a quote by Trump was removed from his sister Montana\u2019s freshman class president photo. Montana had submitted the Trump quote, \u201cI like thinking big. If you are going to be thinking anything, you might as well think big,\u201d to appear underneath her photo. \u201cI want to know who thought it was okay to do this,\u201d said Janet Dobrovich-Fago, the teens\u2019 mother. \u201cI want the school to seek disciplinary action and to be held accountable.\u201d A teacher who advised the yearbook staff has been suspended pending the result of an investigation, Wall Township Public Schools Superintendent Cheryl Dyer said Monday. She did not identify the teacher. Dyer had sent a letter to parents on Friday, saying she was investigating the matter. \u201cThere is nothing in our student dress code that would prevent a student from expressing his or her political views and support for a candidate for political office via appropriate clothing. Rather, I applaud students for becoming involved in politics and for participation in our democratic society,\u201d she wrote. \u201cThe high school administration was not aware of and does not condone any censorship of political views on the part of our students. This includes statements that they might make or clothing with references to candidates for public office that they might wear.\u201d The school\u2019s dress code does prohibit references to illegal activity such as use of drugs, alcohol or weapons, she noted. Both the Berardos and the Dobrovich-Fagos want the school to issue new yearbooks with the original photos and quotes. \u201cThere is an opportunity to use this as a teaching moment for the kids, and for the teachers as well,\u201d Joseph Berardo said. \u201cThis is a First Amendment, freedom of speech issue.\u201d In a statement released June 10, Dyer said the school district\u2019s staffers \u201cstrongly value the principles of free speech and inquiry in our schools and society, viewing them as the bedrock upon which our community and educational system is built. The allegations referenced above are disturbing, and any inappropriate challenge to these principles will be rectified as swiftly and thoroughly as possible.\u201d Dyer said neither she nor the school\u2019s administrators were involved in the alteration of the photos. \u201cWe were not aware of it until the books were distributed, we do not condone it, and we working on a remedy to the issue,\u201d she told CNN Sunday. \u201cI cannot discuss personnel matters, but I take this very seriously and it will be addressed appropriately.\u201d Donald Trump was not completely removed from the yearbook. One page mentions the 2016 presidential election. Joseph Berardo said he asked the school whether students\u2019 shirts supporting Hillary Clinton or Bernie Sanders had been changed but \u201cwe haven\u2019t seen that. No one has said anything, but it\u2019s still the same issue.\u201d \u201cThis is not just about my kids. This is for every student,\u201d said Janet Dobrovich-Fago. Both families plan to meet with the principal and the yearbook adviser this week. CNN\u2019s Gabriela Siegal contributed to this report.",

There\u2019s all kinds of new extreme weather news, plus everything else\u00a0you need to know to Get Up to Speed and Out the Door. (You can also get \u201c5 Things You Need to Know Today\u201d delivered to your inbox daily. Sign up here.) After weeks of bombshell revelations, we\u2019re finally about to hear from James Comey. The fired FBI director will testify before the Senate intelligence committee as soon as next week to confirm his conversations with President Trump and claims Trump asked him to stop the investigation into Michael Flynn\u2019s alleged ties to Russia, a source tells CNN. Let\u2019s step back and process this: The former head of the FBI would essentially accuse the President of the United States \u2013 in public \u2013 of trying to obstruct an investigation. And that\u2019s not all on the Russia front. Congress is investigating whether Attorney General Jeff Sessions had another meeting with Russia\u2019s ambassador during the presidential campaign. The meeting would have been in April 2016 at Washington\u2019s Mayflower Hotel, where Trump was giving his first foreign policy speech. Of course, Sessions got in trouble for not disclosing meetings with Russian officials during his confirmation hearing, forcing him to recuse himself from the Russia probe. Of course, that didn\u2019t stop him from taking part last month in Comey\u2019s firing\u00a0\u2013 but that\u2019s a discussion for another newsletter. President Trump is expected to pull the US out of the Paris climate agreement. Trump tweeted that he\u2019d announce his decision this afternoon in the Rose Garden. If he drops the 2015 deal \u2013 which focuses on reducing greenhouse gas emissions \u2013 the President would keep one of his big campaign promises, but he\u2019d also make a decision that would put the US at odds with just about every other country in the world (except Syria and Nicaragua, which aren\u2019t a part of the deal). It would also be another hit against President Obama\u2019s legacy of combating climate change. Reactions have been swift, with scientists pointing out the lasting consequences this could have for the Earth. European Union leaders are begging Trump not to do it. Many observers say it\u2019s just another sign of America withdrawing from the world, leaving China and Europe in charge. And CNN\u2019s John Sutter says Trump\u2019s move is just a middle finger to our future. There\u2019s grief \u2013 and anger \u2013 in Kabul, a day after a massive suicide blast there killed at least 90 people and injured hundreds.

Hillary Clinton took (kinda) full responsibility\u00a0for her loss during an appearance at a tech conference in California. She also blamed the Russians and ex-FBI Director James Comey and The New York Times (for its coverage of her email scandal). But she also, surprisingly, went after the Democratic National Committee, saying it was bankrupt and had crappy data that caused her to overlook all those working class white voters in the Midwest. President Trump (of course) had to weigh in on Twitter (of course), saying that Clinton should just accept she was a bad candidate. NASA\u2019s making a star turn in 2018.

            "article_content": "Many Trump voters across the country say James Comey's firing doesn't change their opinion of the President \"I was hoping Trump would've done a lot better with his presidency so far,\" Kentucky business owner says President Donald Trump is under fire again, this time for his firing of former FBI Director James Comey. But many of his supporters aren\u2019t joining the outcry. CNN spoke to Trump backers across the country, and while some of them expressed surprise at Comey\u2019s ouster, few said it changed their image of the leader of the free world. Here\u2019s what they had to say: Lee, 46, of West Hollywood, California, said he believes Trump made \u201cthe right decision\u201d in axing Comey. \u201cAs far as the Comey thing goes, I think he gave him plenty of chances. I think what became the last straw was when he (Comey) made that statement about the classified emails showing up on (Hillary Clinton aide Huma Abedin\u2019s and her husband, former Congressman Anthony Weiner\u2019s) laptop. You can\u2019t have rules for the elitist ruling class and not have those rules apply to everybody else. I think in my opinion that was part of (Trump\u2019s) decision. The guy likes to run a tight ship.\u201d As for concerns that Comey\u2019s firing could affect the investigation into Trump\u2019s ties to Russia, Lee doesn\u2019t see it as an issue. \u201cYou know, I think (Trump\u2019s) a lot smarter than that. If he were to fire him and then later \u2026 the news got out that he was actually involved with Russia \u2013 which I don\u2019t believe so \u2013 that would be even worse. The cover-up would be worse than the actual crime, and I don\u2019t think that he would put himself in that situation. The guy, in my opinion, is super smart.\u201d Preisendorf, of Windsor, Colorado, is an independent, but voted for Trump. The Comey firing is yet another incident reinforcing his regret over casting that ballot, he said. Preisendorf thinks Comey should\u2019ve been fired in 2016 during the Clinton email flap and that it\u2019s obvious that Trump fired Comey \u201cjust to protect himself. The way it was done and the timing,  I didn\u2019t think it was right. \u201cI don\u2019t think he\u2019s working for the people. Trump is using his position to make himself, his family and his friends money. It\u2019s blatant.\u201d \u201cI\u2019m still doubting Trump will make it four years.\u201d Standley, 53, of York, Pennsylvania, says he has no issue with Comey\u2019s firing, although he was surprised by it and wonders what effect his ouster will have on the investigation into Trump\u2019s Russia ties. He also thinks the matter has become entirely too political. \u201cI think we should take the politics out of it. Get a special investigation to go out there and get the truth to go ahead and serve America, not the politicians. \u201cWhen a person is in office they should have people around them that are going to go ahead and support what they stand for. I own my own business, and if someone went ahead and undermined me and my business, I would fire them too.\u201d Standley, however, would like to see a special investigation into the firing. \u201cSomething is definitely not right, because the timing and everything is not good. \u2026Something smells with Trump. I don\u2019t have blind loyalty \u2013 no way \u2013 because \u2026 I don\u2019t trust politicians. And that\u2019s part of why I voted for (Trump), because he wasn\u2019t a politician. But once he stepped in there doing the things that he\u2019s done \u2026 he\u2019s going at it like a politician, not a businessman.\u201d So, after the ordeal, is Standley still happy he cast his vote for Trump? \u201cI would say it\u2019s early on, but no. But I still think he\u2019s going to be better than Hillary would have been. Time will tell.\u201d Lewis of Whitesburg, Kentucky, says he doesn\u2019t know how to feel about the Comey firing. \u201cI think even if Hillary had been there, if Hillary had won, he (Comey) would have still gotten fired over \u2026 everything that went through that. I guess he (Trump) could have handled it a little better \u2026 (but) I don\u2019t think it\u2019s as big of a deal as people are making it out to be. Like most of the rest of the politics that\u2019s going on, man, it always gets blown out of proportion. \u201cIt brings up questions of why, why did he fire him, you know? Then who\u2019s going to replace him? You know what I mean? Who\u2019s going to be replacing Comey? Because we do need a good strong FBI. Our country takes a lot to work, you know. \u201cI was hoping Trump would\u2019ve done a lot better with his presidency so far. \u2026 Truthfully, I don\u2019t think he\u2019s really made much progress, but I don\u2019t think he\u2019s going to be able to do as much as he wanted to do. \u201cReally, I\u2019m glad I voted for him. A lot of Hillary\u2019s policies I just couldn\u2019t support. Clearly, we\u2019re diehard conservative here, so you know and I know where she stands against guns and a lot of the right wing.\u201d Scott, from Cleveland, made national headlines when he talked with Trump during a White House meeting in February about fixing the gang violence problem In Chicago, including comments he later revised on meeting with top gang thugs. (Scott, who later said he would meet with former gang members, said Thursday progress on the issue has been made, but some initiatives are in the early stages.) He told CNN that Comey was a \u201cnational distraction\u201d and needed to be fired. He thinks the President tried to make it work. \u201cHe should have fired Comey a long time ago. I think he should have fired Comey when he got into office,\u201d Scott said. \u201cHe extended an olive branch to him.\u201d Scott dismisses the claim that the firing will affect the Russian investigation. \u201cComey himself wasn\u2019t doing the investigating. Comey had field agents investigating and then turning their findings over to him. So, it\u2019s not like Comey\u2019s firing stops the investigation; because it doesn\u2019t.\u201d Roche, 25, of Greeley, Colorado, says he didn\u2019t vote for Trump so much as he voted against Clinton. Overall, he said, he\u2019s frustrated and feels the country is too divided \u2013 and that the media is exacerbating that division. As for the Comey firing, Roche said it was unexpected. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t say it\u2019s the best way to do it, but I don\u2019t get to choose. \u2026 I was surprised but not surprised. Nothing surprises me anymore.\u201d Asked whether he still supports Trump, he said the Comey firing didn\u2019t move the needle for him, and he remains pleased that Clinton is not head of state. \u201cThere are too many things going on right now. Politics are a s**t show.\u201d Andrews, of Savannah, Georgia, is a member of the International Longshoremen\u2019s Association, and stands by Trump. She also thinks far too much is being made of the Russia investigation. \u201cHe\u2019s done nothing but dig and work hard since he\u2019s been in office. If there\u2019s a weakness and he detects it, then they\u2019re gone. He\u2019s only going to surround himself with people who do their job.\u201d \u201cI think the timing (with the Russian investigation) is a coincidence. He was probably told that Comey wasn\u2019t an effective leader so he was out.\u201d Corry, of Chicago, said he might have been surprised by Comey\u2019s firing a couple of years ago, but not now. \u201cNothing surprises me anymore, particularly after what just happened in the election. \u2026 There is no normal or status quo anymore, as much as the Democrats and Republicans try and cram it down our throats.\u201d \u201cThe situation with Comey is interesting because if you go back seven months the Democrats wanted to lynch him.  He had all these fireable offenses. \u2026 \u201cDo I think he got a raw deal? Probably, but that\u2019s the nature of politics.\u201d The situation hasn\u2019t affected his opinion of Trump, although he does wonder why liberals don\u2019t see that their aversion to Trump is not so different from conservatives\u2019 feelings toward Barack Obama during his presidency. \u201cWhat\u2019s frustrating to me is that the left still doesn\u2019t get it, six months later. This isn\u2019t about Trump. It\u2019s about the vote. \u2026 If you look at what happened with Obama, there was just as much pushback (to his actions), so the hypocrisy is right before everyone\u2019s eyes.\u201d Mueller of Beverly Hills, California, is one of Trump\u2019s Latina supporters and a spokeswoman for \u201cMake California Great Again.\u201d \u201cI think that James Comey should have been fired because he protected Hillary Clinton last year with the email scandal \u2026 and didn\u2019t do anything about it then. I think he was paid not to do anything to her. I think he was overdue. I think President Trump did the right thing. (Comey) is not trustworthy \u2026 since he didn\u2019t put her in jail or bring her to court with her email server. So how can you trust him in anything that he tries to investigate?\u201d On Trump appointing a new FBI director, she said, \u201cI really believe President Trump will appoint the best man for the job. He\u2019s going to do his best, because he\u2019s a man who always asks for opinions from other people. I think he will appoint a very good person.\u201d Walking around a sunny downtown Charleston, West Virginia, during lunchtime, it was not hard to find a Trump voter, here in the state that gave the President his widest margin of victory in November. Dakota Wiseman, who at 20 years old cast his first ballot in a presidential race for Trump, was unabashed about the Comey decision. \u201cGood decision. He got fired for not doing the job right. You gotta do your job to keep your job,\u201d Wiseman said. Another Trump voter said decisions like this week\u2019s have made her think about hers last November. \u201cI\u2019m starting to regret it,\u201d Melissa Morton, 51, said. \u201cI think about that decision a lot. \u201cHis behavior,\u201d she explained. \u201cHe\u2019s just classless.\u201d Medina, 53, of Miami, is a big Trump supporter who helped organize the Deplorables Inauguration Ball in Washington, D.C. earlier this year. \u201cI\u2019m totally OK with the firing, not necessarily how it went down. I wish it had been a little more elegant,\u201d said the president and CEO of the Downtown Miami & Brickell Chamber of Commerce. \u201cTrump is unorthodox. I don\u2019t always have to agree with his form and fashion, but he\u2019s always gonna do it his way, just like the (Frank Sinatra) song.\u201d \u201cIt was essential to bring back the role of the FBI. (Comey) took liberties he never should have. \u2026 He became political, and once you became political you can win and you can lose. Comey lost,\u201d he said. \u201cThe Democrats haven\u2019t accepted that they lost the election. \u2026 They hated Comey, and now they love Comey.\u201d Asked whether he was concerned Comey\u2019s firing could have any affect on federal investigations into White House ties to Russia, Medina told CNN he feels the Russia issue is overblown. \u201cIt became sexy all the sudden. I haven\u2019t seen any evidence of Russian collusion. Russia didn\u2019t pick me up, drive me to the polls and tell me which way to vote.\u201d Stoner, 80, is originally from Detroit but has lived in Greeley, Colorado, with his wife of 40 years for almost a decade. The Army veteran voted for Trump and thinks he\u2019s doing a good job, but he conceded no politician is perfect. In regard to firing Comey, Trump was \u201cwell within his rights and should\u2019ve done it a long time ago. \u2026 We need new blood.\u201d He doesn\u2019t care for Comey because he thinks the former FBI director protected Clinton, which amounted, in his opinion, to Comey \u201cacting as a judge, not an investigator.\u201d He also appreciated the unexpected nature of Trump\u2019s announcement: \u201cTrump doesn\u2019t broadcast what he\u2019s gonna do; he just does it, and I like that.\u201d Nadia Larsen emigrated from Israel and now lives in Tucson, Arizona. \u201cI support my president 100% for firing Comey. He did a bad job, period.\u201d The Santa Clarita, California, resident said he is not a \u201cTrumper,\u201d but is a supporter of the President. He said the timing of the firing didn\u2019t bother him. \u201cIf he would have came in and wiped everybody out in January you know everybody would have said, \u2018Well, it\u2019s a regime. He\u2019s going to wipe everybody out and bring in his own people.\u2019 Well doesn\u2019t every president do that? So no, the timing doesn\u2019t bother me.\u201d Messina didn\u2019t agree with the way the dismissal went down. He thought the White House should have waited until Comey was back in Washington. He added that the media was spending too much time on the firing. \u201cWe\u2019ve got stuff going on all over the world, and 90% of the media\u2019s questions are about this firing. \u2018Was it 12:01 or was it 1:15?\u2019  Is that really what they\u2019re going to fixate on?\u201d",

The song blasted from car radios and TVs tuned to \u201cSoul Train.\u201d As soon as my friends heard the opening guitar riff, someone would shout, \u201cOh, that\u2019s my jam,\u201d and people would start bopping their heads and singing along. I thought the band behind my summer anthem was black. Then one day I turned on the TV and experienced what psychologists call \u201ccognitive dissonance.\u201d My jaw dropped when I saw \u201cWild Cherry,\u201d a bunch of skinny white guys with permed afros, tear into my song. I remember suddenly feeling guilty for liking it and wondering if some racial boundary had been crossed. I had never heard white people talk about being white before. I hear plenty of it today, though. There\u2019s been a rise of racial consciousness among white Americans. \u201cWhiteness studies\u201d programs are popping up at colleges across the US. Rural white Americans are the focus of popular books like \u201cHillbilly Elegy\u201d and \u201cWhite Trash: The 400-Year Untold History of Class in America.\u201d Whites now believe they suffer more from racism than blacks, according to a recent study. Some political pundits even attribute President Donald Trump\u2019s election victory to an \u201cuprising\u201d among rural white voters. Basically, white has become the new black.  This is a flip of the traditional racial script in America. Being \u201cAmerican\u201d traditionally meant white. It was the norm. \u201cIf you\u2019re white, you\u2019re alright,\u201d one popular expression went. Whiteness, according to author Toni Morrison, was the \u201cdefinition of \u2018Americanness.\u2019\u201d People of color were the ones who traditionally told stories of suddenly discovering they were different, of not fitting in. These are the painful stories heard in CNN\u2019s new video series, \u201cThe First Time I Realized I Was Black.\u201d Now white people are telling the same kind of stories. Here are three people talking about the moments they discovered they are white. One says it was triggered by a simple question on a school test; another points to an innocuous question from a girl; and a third cites an encounter that ended with him bleeding and confused. A Sunday School teacher once asked Dani Fitzgerald\u2019s mom: \u201cWhen are you going to tell her she\u2019s white?\u201d Her mom, Debbi, laughed it off. \u201cWe don\u2019t talk about people\u2019s color, ever,\u201d she told the teacher. Sometimes we hear people say they don\u2019t see color, that their family taught them to ignore racial distinctions. But Fitzgerald\u2019s story illustrates how raising someone in a racial cocoon presents risks as well as rewards. Today, Fitzgerald is a 23-year-old teacher with cherub cheeks, blue eyes and, occasionally, a tiny silver nose ring. Her racial cocoon was a predominately black church in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. That\u2019s where she spent most of her childhood.The Pentecostal church was led by her grandfather, and the only white people in the church were members of her family. Homeschooled by her parents, she says they never talked about people\u2019s races, including their own. \u201cAs a child my parents never made a distinction between races \u2013 ever,\u201d she wrote in an essay titled \u201cI Didn\u2019t Know I Was White,\u201d which was published by her college newspaper two years ago. Black people weren\u2019t \u201cthose people\u201d in her world. They were her people. They were the people she prayed and sang with in the pews and laughed with at church picnics. Even today the songs she sings to lift her spirits are drawn from the black experience. She loves black spirituals like \u201cHave a Little Talk with Jesus\u201d or \u201cPrecious Lord, Take My Hand.\u201d Around the age of 10, though, she started sensing she was different from her church family. Her parents invited white friends to their church, but they rarely accepted. When they did, they were visibly uncomfortable. Only later would she learn that her parents were criticized for having black friends. \u201cI can remember the tightened faces and widened eyes of our white friends as my church family embraced them with a hug and wet kiss on the cheek,\u201d said Fitzgerald. \u201cIt was little moments like that where I noticed something different about my church family and my white friends. It was confusing.\u201d The confusion intensified as she got older. Though her parents attended a virtually all-black church, they lived in white suburban neighborhoods. When she became a teenager, her parents let her attend a public high school. There were about 2,000 students in the school; only about a half dozen were black. Still, she said, her church held such a powerful hold on her that she was unsure of her racial identity. Then one day in 8th grade she had to take a standardized test that asked her to check a box for race. \u201cThat was one of the first times I can recall having to put down my race for anything,\u201d said Fitzgerald. \u201cSeeing the races lined up like that, I had no idea what to put.\u201d  She looked at the kid next to her and saw he checked \u201cAsian.\u201d She did the same thing. It wasn\u2019t until a year later that she realized her mistake. She overheard a group of white students talking about how odd the word \u201cCaucasian\u201d was because they only used it on test forms. \u201cIt hit me like a flashback,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was then that I remembered I put the wrong race. \u2026 That was difficult because at my age, I should\u2019ve known that I was white. When my friends were talking about being \u2018Caucasian\u2019 I felt really stupid. How didn\u2019t I know that?\u201d Later, Fitzgerald would see another disconnect: Some of her white friends\u2019 descriptions of black people didn\u2019t match what she knew about her black church family. Once she was in a car with her white friends when they entered a black neighborhood. \u201cI remember their parents saying, \u2018Lock the doors! Lock the doors!\u2019 And when I looked outside, I saw black people.\u201d When she started dating a black guy \u2013 now her fiancee \u2013 some of her white friends were bewildered. Some still are. They ask her how her parents reacted. \u201cWhen I give a quick explanation of my parents\u2019 love for all people, the reply is usually, \u2018Yeah, my dad would kill me if I brought home a black guy.\u2019 And they give me an explanation for how \u2018totally not racist\u2019 their father is.\u201d I asked if her mother ever sat her down to tell her she was white. It never happened. \u201cMy parents knew I\u2019d eventually figure out I\u2019m white,\u201d she said. \u201cThey just didn\u2019t want to have an influence on that. They wanted me to grow up in an environment where I\u2019m loved by all people, some white, some black.\u201d Her family\u2019s attitude toward race is rooted in their faith. Jesus ignored racial, cultural and gender distinctions. So should his followers, she said. One of her favorite passages comes from Galatians 3:28: \u201cThere is neither Jew nor Gentile, neither slave nor free, nor is there male and female, for you are all one in Christ Jesus.\u201d Those are beautiful sentiments. I wonder, though, if Fitzgerald will retain her parents\u2019 optimism when she has children. She is currently teaching English as a second language in Thailand. When she returns to the US, she plans on marrying her fiancee, who is studying criminal justice, and starting a family. What racial box will she tell their children to check? Or will she, like her parents, not \u201ctalk about people\u2019s color, ever\u201d? \u201cThey shouldn\u2019t have to pick one race because they will be as equally black as they are white,\u201d said Fitzgerald. \u201cBut how does that look practically? I\u2019m not so sure.\u201d Whitney Dow once thought he knew what being white was all about. A bespectacled filmmaker who talks passionately about race, he\u2019s given speeches on the subject, appeared on television and made films for PBS on civil rights \u2013 including \u201cTwo Towns of Jasper,\u201d a critically acclaimed documentary about the murder of a black man in Jasper, Texas. But it was a simple question from a 7th grader that made him realize he was white, he said. He\u2019d been invited to a fundraiser to talk about the making of \u201cTwo Towns of Jasper.\u201d A group of middle school students came to hear him speak; afterward a young girl asked about his experience working with his black filmmaking partner, Marco Williams. \u201cWhat did you learn about your racial identity working with Marco?\u201d Dow\u2019s response was instinctive: \u201cI don\u2019t have one,\u201d he told her. \u201cI\u2019m an individual.\u201d But then he thought back to his experiences in Jasper and had what he calls a \u201cracial epiphany.\u201d He realized he was more than an individual. He was white, and there was a huge difference between understanding this intellectually and experiencing it emotionally. While filming in Jasper, he\u2019d gone into a black-owned auto shop to talk to workers and customers about the 1998 murder of James Byrd Jr., who had been chained by the ankles to the back of a pickup truck and dragged to his death by a group of white men. Dow said he felt like a crusading filmmaker getting the true story. But then Marco later went to the same shop and filmed his own interviews with the same people. When he and Marco compared footage, Dow was stunned. The black people in the shop had given Dow false names and an entire set of false stories. His good intentions didn\u2019t matter. They didn\u2019t see an individual; they saw him as a threat, a white man in a town where other white men had tortured and murdered a black man. Kendrick Sampson: When I realized I was black Dow was 14 when he met Marco, and he thought they were similar. But it wasn\u2019t just their footage that didn\u2019t jibe; they clashed over certain goals and scenes in the film. \u201cWe got to the point that we couldn\u2019t agree on reality,\u201d he said. \u201cWe left the film feeling that there were certain gulfs that could not be bridged.\u201d By asking her question \u2013 and triggering his memories of Jasper \u2013 that 7th grader changed how Dow saw himself. \u201cI had never fully grappled with my own race,\u201d he said. \u201cI had never really understood that this was an active, dynamic component that impacted every moment of my life.\u201d I heard about Dow because he\u2019s become an authority on \u201cwhiteness.\u201d His latest work for PBS is an \u201cinteractive investigation\u201d called the \u201cWhiteness Project.\u201d Dow travels the country asking people who identify as white or \u201cpartially white\u201d to talk about what being white means to them. Two installments have aired so far. When Dow approached potential donors for the \u201cWhiteness Project,\u201d some thought he was joking. It\u2019s easy to understand why. At first glance, defining whiteness seems so elusive. People tend to think of it in extremes. \u201cWhiteness is on a toggle switch between \u2018bland nothingness\u2019 and \u2018racial hatred,\u2019\u201d author and historian Nell Irvin Painter wrote in a New York Times essay, \u201cWhat is Whiteness?\u201d But the evolution of whiteness is so much more complex. It was invented; not inherited. Some race scholars say it was created around the 17th century as a legal term to confer certain protections and privileges on Americans of European descent. It was also used to reinforce the notion of a superior white race \u2013 and to justify slavery. Dow gives some of this historical context in the \u201cWhiteness Project\u201d in between interviews with his subjects. But I think the most fascinating part of his project is seeing white people grapple with their racial identity. Some people denied their whiteness. Others were apologetic. One young white man said \u201cI\u2019m not happy that I\u2019m white,\u201d citing the historic oppression associated with his people. Another guy wondered why black people still get hung up on \u201cthe slave thing.\u201d One interview stood out above the rest. I could see the moment a young man discovered he was white. Montel Williams: When I realized I was black He was a white millennial in Dallas, Texas, who looked like he could be a J. Crew model. He was clean-shaven, square-jawed and broad-shouldered. He was also a former drug dealer who sheepishly confessed he had been arrested at least 20 times, but that the only mark on his record was a public intoxication charge. He said he knew if he got a lawyer, the judge would go easy on him because of how he looked. \u201cI basically did whatever I wanted to, knowing that there were absolutely no consequences,\u201d he said. \u201cI would be in jail if I wasn\u2019t white.\u201d Dow asked him if he ever felt guilty about his past. He paused to consider the question. A look of confusion on his face gave way to realization. \u201cMe talking about it,\u201d he said, \u201cis making me realize: Damn, I\u2019m pretty lucky.\u201d Dow, 55, said he understands why more white people are talking about being white today. Some have a sense they are being left behind. They might not see more people of color in their personal lives, but they see them in movies, on newscasts and throughout popular culture. \u201cIt\u2019s almost as if you\u2019re a person of color, you are on the trajectory up,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s a positive narrative. It\u2019s against oppression. Things are getting better. It\u2019s not a straight line, but the narrative is we\u2019re working for equality and freedom.\u201d Dow is still working to understand what being white means. He said the 7th grader\u2019s question inspired him to start the \u201cWhiteness Project.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t think she realized that she changed my life,\u201d he said. In that moment, she also inspired him to change his answer. After he told her he had no racial identity, Dow thought about his experiences in Jasper and decided to answer again. \u201cOf course, that\u2019s not true,\u201d he told her. \u201cI have the most powerful racial identity in America. I\u2019m a white male.\u201d Editor\u2019s note: The section below contains language that could be offensive to some. What if racial categories aren\u2019t set in stone but stretch like taffy? That\u2019s the analogy I thought of when I considered the story of a black man who discovered he was white. That man is my younger brother, Patrick. I don\u2019t normally write about family. But my brother and I belong to the \u201cpartially white\u201d category Dow explores in his \u201cWhiteness Project.\u201d We are biracial. When I told my brother about this story, he told me about the day he discovered he was white. It was one of the saddest and strangest tales I\u2019ve ever heard him tell. Our mother is Irish and our father is black. But we didn\u2019t see ourselves as white. We grew up with our father\u2019s family in a black community. We didn\u2019t meet our mother or her family until we were young men. When we were kids, being biracial wasn\u2019t cool or exotic. It was the 1970s and early \u201980s in inner-city Baltimore. Our world was all black. Whites were viewed with disdain. The only whites we saw were police officers or bill collectors. They were so vilified that I never told anyone my mother was white. It was a badge of shame. And it could get you hurt. That\u2019s what happened to my brother one day when he was 13. He was walking home alone on a deserted stretch of railroad tracks when he heard a chorus of voices behind him. \u201cHey white boy! White boy! Hey you honky,\u201d a group of boys shouted. At first, my brother didn\u2019t know they were talking to him. Then he realized he was the only other person on the tracks. He heard their footsteps quicken. They were coming after him. He started running. Then they started throwing rocks \u2013 not small ones but those big, jagged rocks that line railway beds. One hit him on the side of his head. It made a strange \u201cthwack\u201d when it hit his skull. He started bleeding. He finally outran the boys and arrived home trembling. \u201cI felt this overwhelming sense of sadness,\u201d said Patrick. \u201cThey were mad at me because of the color of my skin. I remember walking home, tears coming to my eyes, not because of the physical assault but because these were my own people. But they didn\u2019t see it because of the color of my skin.\u201d I knew how he felt. I would lash out whenever kids called me \u201cwhite boy.\u201d I got in so many fights because of those two words. I can still remember the taunts from the boys in my neighborhood as I rolled on the ground fighting my latest accuser: \u201cIt\u2019s a fight, it\u2019s a fight; between a nigger and a white.\u201d My brother told me his whiteness made him feel like a person with a disability. If he walked outside, he would immediately attract second looks because of his fair complexion and hair texture. \u201cI thought of myself as black,\u201d said Patrick, now 51, \u201cbut I understood myself to be white in my neighborhood.\u201d Neither of us had the understanding of race to articulate what we were going through then. Only later would I learn that \u201cwhiteness\u201d is actually elastic. The Irish, our mother\u2019s ethnic group, were once not considered fully white in 19th century America. The same with Italians, Jews and Greeks. They had to work their way into whiteness, often by conspicuously hating blacks. Those kind of appeals to racial solidarity wouldn\u2019t have made any difference to the boys I tangled with in my neighborhood. They saw me and my brother as the enemy. But then, years later, my brother had his white credentials revoked. It happened during a dinner date with a white woman. After moving to Charlotte, North Carolina, my brother joined a church where he was one of four blacks in a congregation of 1,500. There was a young German woman who had her eyes on Patrick, so he invited her to dinner. As they ate in his apartment, she asked him where was he from. Not satisfied by his answer of \u201cBaltimore,\u201d she asked another question: \u201cWhat\u2019s your race?\u201d \u201cOh, I\u2019m both. I\u2019m black and white,\u201d my brother told her. The woman\u2019s eyes widened and she dropped her fork. Then a look of fear appeared on her face. \u201cI have to leave,\u201d she told him. \u201cI don\u2019t believe in the mixing of races.\u201d My brother said he was too stunned to get mad. Then one day he had an experience that should have made him even angrier \u2013 if it hadn\u2019t been comforting in an odd way. It happened in college after he got a job working at a home improvement store. He was using a forklift to unload a truck when he heard some voices behind him in a car yell, \u201cHey nigger.\u201d \u201cI thought they were talking about the truck driver,\u201d he said. \u201cHe was black. I\u2019d never been called nigger before.\u201d He ignored them until one of the voices said: \u201cHey you nigger on the forklift.\u201d He shrugged as the white man in the car flipped him the bird and drove off. \u201cI kind of felt relieved,\u201d he said. \u201cI had arrived. It was comical. I remember smiling, saying, \u2018Damn, I\u2019m black now.\u201d\u2019 As time went on, he embraced the racial whiplash. Sometimes he checked the box for \u201cwhite\u201d on job applications; sometimes \u201cAfrican-American.\u201d But he\u2019s always seen himself as African-American because that\u2019s how he\u2019s viewed by most people he meets. Does he miss being white? \u201cHell no, because I\u2019m more comfortable in my skin now,\u201d he said. \u201cIf somebody calls me a white boy, I\u2019m not offended, and we can deal with it if necessary.\u201d One crucial moment made us both comfortable with our \u201cpartial\u201d whiteness: when we first met our mother. I was 18, he was 17. Van Jones: When I realized I was black We knew the reason for the separation. Our mother\u2019s family had disowned us because of our father\u2019s race. Our mother was an unwed teenager when she gave birth to us, and she was forced by her family to keep away from her children. Interracial marriage was illegal when we were born. My brother still remembers how he felt at that meeting. I felt the same way: whole. For the first time in our lives, the circle was complete. Until then, we hadn\u2019t felt like we belonged anywhere; we\u2019d felt victimized by racial prejudice from both blacks and whites. \u201cWhen she came out to greet me, I didn\u2019t see any hesitation over whether I was black or white,\u201d said Patrick. \u201cShe was a sweet, loving person who loved her boys 100%. It really helped me be comfortable and not be ashamed of the whiteness in me. I don\u2019t really give a flip about people who say I look too white or black, because I have two loving parents. \u201cAnd because I\u2019m both.\u201d I worked out my racial identity a little differently: Meeting my mother drove me to read books about race. When I read about the Irish, I see similarities with African-Americans. Both peoples had their culture and language usurped by a more dominant group. Both were looked down upon; the Irish used to be called \u201cwhite niggers.\u201d Few use that derogatory term today because the Irish are now considered white. Others may soon join the club. People talk about the browning of America, but already more Hispanics are identifying as white, according to a study of census forms. It no longer surprises me when white people talk about being white. Nobody gives a second look at white boys playing funky music \u2013 or grappling with the different ways of being white. My ultimate hope, though, is for another day \u2013 when we learn not that we\u2019re white, black, brown or something else. We\u2019ll discover that we\u2019re all human, and race no longer divides us.",

            "article_content": "Are you experiencing the following symptoms? Insomnia: No sleep because you dread what happens over the next four years. Hallucinations: You keep thinking that what you saw on TV last November must be a bad dream. Fits of rage: You\u2019ve unfriended half of your Facebook friends and you won\u2019t talk to certain relatives about politics anymore. If so, you may be suffering from a \u201cTrump Slump.\u201d There are millions of Americans who are feeling just fine. For them, Donald Trump is a champion, a truth-teller who takes on the elites and will restore America\u2019s greatness. But there are other Americans who have been mired in a stupor since election night. If President Barack Obama seemed to them like the fulfillment of the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr.\u2019s dream, then Trump represents their nightmare. Both King and Trump will compete for headlines this week. On Monday, King will be celebrated. On Friday, Trump will be inaugurated. CNN asked a group of activists, historians and King biographers to elaborate on this coincidence by answering one question: What can Americans bracing for the Trump era learn from the life of King? They cited three key moments from King\u2019s life: a conversation he had with an enemy; a disaster that followed one of his greatest triumphs; and the subversive nature of his best-known speech. One even came up with a surprising message for those who label all Trump voters stone-cold racists: You\u2019re dishonoring the spirit of King. King was in a Birmingham jail in 1963 when he developed an odd ritual with his white jailers. They would come by his cell to tell him why segregation was right and intermarriage wrong. A polite debate would ensue. The white jailers would return the next day for more. One day, King asked one of the jailers how much he made. The jailer told him. King recalled what happened next in one of his most famous sermons, \u201cThe Drum Major Instinct.\u201d \u201cI said \u2018Now you know what? You ought to be marching with us,\u2019 \u201d King recalled. \u201c\u2018You\u2019re just as poor as Negroes. \u2026 You fail to see that the same forces that oppress Negroes in American society oppress poor white people.\u201d After Trump\u2019s stunning victory, some people opposed to his candidacy vowed not to call him their president. Some cut off relationships with Trump supporters or called them all racists. It was a new form of segregation: I shall only associate with those who share my political beliefs. Looking for hope in Trump's America at MLK's grave site That kind of decision wouldn\u2019t fly with King. He didn\u2019t withdraw from his white jailers or lash out at them. It was a pattern that ran throughout his life, says David Garrow, author of \u201cBearing the Cross,\u201d a Pulitzer Prize-winning biography of King. \u201cKing consistently distinguished between the evil deed and evil doer. He never hated anyone,\u201d Garrow says. \u201cI see all these progressives filled with this hatred and loathing of Trump voters, but we never see King talk in hateful or loathing terms about Bull Connor or Jim Clark,\u201d Garrow says, referring to two notoriously racist Southern white sheriffs. \u201cSo much of the liberal left today is allowing themselves to be subsumed with a hate and anger that is utterly contradictory to King\u2019s spirit.\u201d King\u2019s refusal to demonize others extended to his organizing tactics. He\u2019s often depicted as a black civil rights leader. But that\u2019s not accurate. He was a human rights leader. He constantly sought to expand his civil rights coalition. He built ties with rabbis, white union leaders and black gang members, even traveling to India and Africa to forge relationships. One of King\u2019s most courageous public stands came in the defense not of black people but of Asians. On April 4, 1967, he delivered a famous speech denouncing the Vietnam War in which he talked powerfully about the suffering of the Vietnamese people. He had been moved to give the speech after seeing pictures in a magazine of North Vietnamese children burned by napalm bombs dropped by U.S. and South Vietnamese forces. He was roundly denounced by the media and even black leaders. Funding for the civil rights movement dried up, and President Lyndon Johnson stopped talking to him. But he never abandoned his anti-war position. \u201cHe had a genuine spiritual core in which all souls were the same,\u201d says John Baick, a historian who teaches at Western New England University in Massachusetts. That included poor, working-class white people. There\u2019s a lot of talk today about the white, working-class voters who helped put Trump in office. Some say Democrats ignored and belittled them. No one could have made that charge against King. He died while trying to help poor white people. When he was assassinated in 1968 he was about to launch his most audacious movement \u2013 the Poor People\u2019s Campaign. He had recruited an interracial army of poor people \u2013 white Appalachians, Latinos, Native Americans and blacks \u2013 to descend on Washington and shut it down if necessary to force the federal government to address poverty. It was Occupy Washington 40 years before there was an Occupy Wall Street. MLK was a Republican and other myths In a 1964 Playboy interview, King specifically mentioned the plight of poor whites when he said the country needed a $50 billion federal program to address poverty. \u201cI do not intend that this program of economic aid should apply only to the Negro; it should benefit the disadvantaged of all races,\u201d King said. King\u2019s refusal to just be a black leader was reflected in a quote he often used: \u201cWe are tied together in the single garment of destiny, caught in an inescapable network of mutuality.  And whatever affects one directly affects all indirectly. \u2026I can never be what I ought to be until you are what you ought to be.\u201d Inspirational. Kind. A dreamer. Those are just some of the words people use to describe King. But here\u2019s one you rarely hear: Tough. Don\u2019t be fooled by the ministerial smile and deacon\u2019s clothes King habitually wore. He was relentless. He was jailed 14 times, stabbed once in the chest, beaten at least twice in public. His home was bombed, he received constant death threats, and there\u2019s evidence that suggests the FBI even tried to get him to commit suicide by threatening to send his wife audiotapes of his extramarital trysts. Yet he never abandoned his activism. He often worked 20-hour days and gave up to 450 speeches a year. One of King\u2019s most famous sermons was on toughness. In \u201cA Tough Mind and a Tender Heart,\u201d King preached about the value of blending love and toughness and not settling \u201cfor easy answers and half-baked solutions.\u201d After Obama gave his farewell address last week, many people wondered if all the hope of the Obama era was futile. Some sounded like people who had given up on politics. Toughen up, says Jonathan Rieder, another King biographer, and look at what King and other foot soldiers of the movement endured. These were people who had survived the Great Depression and World War II, been beaten and called names; some even lost their lives. They knew social change was never easy. \u201cThe movement was always spiraling down into disappointment and demoralization,\u201d Rieder says. \u201cBut the movement had success because people had stamina and resilience.\u201d Consider what happened after King delivered his \u201cI Have a Dream\u201d speech on a humid, sunlit day in August 1963 in Washington. Photos: 1963 Birmingham church bombing Disaster after disaster followed. A civil rights bill that had been languishing in Congress couldn\u2019t get a full vote; four black girls were murdered by a bomb blast in a Birmingham church as they prepared for Sunday school; President John F. Kennedy, who had given a courageous speech defending civil rights, was assassinated. All the momentum of the movement seemed lost. \u201cBut we went back to work,\u201d says the Rev. William Barber, a leader in \u201cMoral Mondays,\u201d the grassroots social justice movement formed in North Carolina in 2013 before spreading to other states.  \u201cWe got the 1964 Civil Rights Act passed and the Voting Rights Act in 1965.\u201d Barber says he\u2019s heard some people say Trump\u2019s election is the worst thing in history. \u201cIt\u2019s a misreading of history,\u201d he says. \u201cIt\u2019s not worse than slavery, Jim Crow. It\u2019s not the first time that America has elected a racist president in terms of policy. Trump\u2019s election is as American as apple pie.\u201d People shouldn\u2019t talk of Trump\u2019s election as an extinction-level event, he says. \u201cWe weren\u2019t unelected; the Constitution wasn\u2019t unelected; our faith wasn\u2019t unelected,\u201d Barber says. Much of King\u2019s toughness came from his faith, Rieder says. He drew from the faith of black Christianity, the faith formed by slaves. It was not a prosperity gospel. It was a faith that expected the faithful to suffer, knowing that good would eventually win. It was a faith built on sermons about resilience: Weeping may come at midnight but rejoicing comes in the morning; the resurrection follows the crucifixion; keep your eyes on the prize. It was a tough faith that King leaned on when he became despondent, says Rieder, author of \u201cThe Word of the Lord is Upon Me: The Righteous Performance of Martin Luther King Jr.\u201d \u201cThey understood that Exodus wasn\u2019t just a metaphor,\u201d he says. \u201cIt repeats itself in every generation because there will always be people in bondage.\u201d Now is the time for healing. Now is the time to unite behind our new leader. Now is not the time to fan divisions. Those are just some of the calls that greeted America after one of the most bitterly contested presidential elections in recent history. Those who say they will join \u201cthe resistance\u201d to Trump are often derided as out-of-touch troublemakers. So was King, some of his biographers say. They cite one of King\u2019s most famous documents: \u201cLetter from Birmingham City Jail.\u201d It reads today like something that would fit right in during the era of \u201cBlack Lives Matter.\u201d It addresses the same tension: How to make noise to get justice. The greatest MLK speeches you never heard Some of the lines from the letter are now classic. In one passage, King said the biggest threat to racial progress came not from vicious racists but from the white moderate who is \u201cmore devoted to order than justice; who prefers a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice.\u201d In others, King wrote that people had a duty to break unjust laws and that no demonstration ever came at the right time. And to critics who said his demonstrations incited violence, he asked: \u201cIsn\u2019t this like condemning the robbed man because his possession of money precipitated the evil act of robbery?\u201d King had little sympathy for people who withdrew from political participation because they thought the system was too corrupt. \u201cWe must learn that passively to accept an unjust system is to co-operate with that system, and hereby to become a participant in its evil.\u201d   Even in King\u2019s biggest crossover moment, his \u201cI Have a Dream\u201d speech, he talked about the \u201cmarvelous militancy\u201d of the movement, saying blacks \u201cwill not be satisfied until justice rolls down like waters.\u201d \u201cHe was a disrupter,\u201d Rieder says. \u201cHe was a disrupter even in his most gentle speech.\u201d There may be more disruption ahead. Barber says Moral Mondays is organizing a successor to the Poor People\u2019s Campaign that will go to Washington. It\u2019ll be another interracial army talking about poverty, health care, the environment. Barber is not interested in merely remembering King \u2013 he wants to extend King\u2019s vision. He is echoing a sentiment that made the social media rounds after Trump\u2019s election: \u201cTrump is the president; he\u2019s not the future.\u201d \u201cIn every age, there had to be a group of people who understand that they were born for such a time as this,\u201d Barber says. \u201cKing said he was tracked down by the zeitgeist. \u201cNow it\u2019s our time.\u201d",

            "article_content": "The President is planning a major infrastructure push in January He hopes the effort will garner bipartisan support, but it's far from assured President Donald Trump, looking ahead to a critical election year where his record will be on the ballot alongside Republican lawmakers, plans a major push on infrastructure in January, aides said this week. Before decamping to his Florida estate for the holiday, Trump predicted his effort to repair the country\u2019s roads, airports and bridges would garner bipartisan support with ease. But his plan of winning over Democrats \u2013 critical to passing such a spending package \u2013 remains a long shot, given the President\u2019s own divisive politics, the details of his proposal and the pending midterm election. Despite promising a $1 trillion infrastructure bill during the campaign, Trump\u2019s plan is shaping up differently. A White House official said on Tuesday the current proposal \u2013 set to be unveiled in the middle of January \u2013 would propose spending at least $200 billion on infrastructure projects over the next decade, with the hopes of spurring an additional $800 billion in state and local funding. Trump\u2019s $1 trillion infrastructure promise has an obstacle: His own budget cuts Some Democrats and business groups have said that $200 billion is too low. But the White House official characterized the figure as a floor, not a ceiling, and said Trump is willing to spend more federal dollars if it means getting a package through Congress. Wooing Democrats on infrastructure, however, will likely require more than just a spending increase. Historically unpopular months before a critical election, Trump will need to convince members of the opposing party to work with him just as they prepare to face voters. That\u2019s a problem for Trump, who will return to Washington to find Republicans with a slim one-vote majority in the Senate after Democrat Doug Jones unexpectedly defeated Republican Roy Moore in Alabama earlier this month. In order to pass an infrastructure bill this year, Trump will need 60 votes, making it impossible to do without some Democratic support. Even still, top White House aides have pledged infrastructure will be their primary focus as the calendar turns to 2018. Trump\u2019s top legislative aide, Marc Short, said Sunday that the President hopes to unveil an infrastructure plan in January and plans to meet with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and House Speaker Paul Ryan at Camp David the first weekend in the month to \u201cmake sure we\u2019re all on the same page about what our priorities are for 2018.\u201d The White House expects to hold additional meetings to finalize the infrastructure plan in the days leading up to the Camp David talks. Trump himself teased possible action on infrastructure before leaving Washington for the last time in 2017 and heading to Florida for a prolonged vacation at Mar-a-Lago, his South Florida private club. \u201cI really believe infrastructure can be bipartisan,\u201d Trump said from the Oval Office earlier this month. \u201cPeople want it, Republicans and Democrats.\u201d Trump\u2019s comments came in the afterglow of his successful effort to rewrite the nation\u2019s tax laws, a bill that Trump touted as something that could garner bipartisan support earlier this year but ended up being passed along party lines. Infrastructure has historically proven more fertile ground for bipartisanship than taxes, and White House officials have suggested that few politicians would oppose a plan to fix the country\u2019s crumbling public works. \u201cEveryone recognizes this is a problem,\u201d one administration official said this week. The White House has been workshopping ideas to include in their proposal with Democrats and Republicans alike for months, including with members of Congress. The plan the President is expected to announce in January won\u2019t be a formal piece of legislation, officials said. Instead, it will provide the administration\u2019s principles for infrastructure reform that lawmakers can then craft into a bill. In addition to the spending, the White House will propose altering federal permitting processes, hoping to reduce the time it takes to complete projects. The White House says it has consulted with various agencies who handle building permits over the past weeks to gather input. By the time Trump delivers his first State of the Union address on January 30, aides hope the proposal will have gained traction among lawmakers. Like presidents before him, Trump is planning to travel around the country selling aspects of his speech, including possible events at structures in need of repair. A real estate tycoon and builder, Trump is \u201cnaturally interested\u201d in infrastructure reform, an aide said on Tuesday. During the 2016 campaign \u2013 in an effort to woo working class voters whose employers would benefit from a concerted infrastructure push \u2013 Trump promised a $1 trillion infrastructure plan within his first 100 days in office. The effort was put off amid legislative battles over heath care and tax reform. \u201cI actually wanted to save the easy one for the one down the road,\u201d Trump said earlier this month from the Oval Office, when asked why he didn\u2019t start his legislative agenda with an infrastructure plan. In his first presidential budget, Trump proposed allocating the $200 billion over 10 years for infrastructure projects. But an analysis by the University of Pennsylvania\u2019s Wharton Budget Model, a nonpartisan research organization, found that Trump\u2019s budget cut infrastructure spending overall by $55 billion by slashing programs that write grants for highway renovation, Native American water facilities and rural airports. At the time, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said that Trump\u2019s infrastructure campaign promises \u201care crumbling faster than our roads and bridges.\u201d Publicly, most Democrats have remained open to working with Trump on an infrastructure package. But Trump\u2019s historically low approval rating could hamper efforts at bipartisanship. Trump's approval rating just entered a league of its own According to a CNN poll, just 35% of Americans approve of Trump, meaning it is not politically risky for Democrats to stand opposed to the President. Additionally, the base of the Democratic Party is unified around their opposition of Trump. According to the CNN poll, 93% of Democrats disapprove of Trump\u2019s handling of the job, meaning any Democrat who steps out to work with the President is taking a political risk. White House officials hope that Democrats running for reelection in states the President won in 2016 \u2013 Sens. Joe Donnelly of Indiana, Claire McCaskill in Missouri and Jon Tester in Montana \u2013 will be more likely to go along on infrastructure reform during a midterm election year. But Trump said the same about tax reform and all those Democrats stood uniformly against the plan, feeling it was safer to stand against Trump than stand with him. Trump has tried to goad Democrats into backing him on infrastructure. At some point, and for the good of the country, I predict we will start working with the Democrats in a Bipartisan fashion. Infrastructure would be a perfect place to start. After having foolishly spent $7 trillion in the Middle East, it is time to start rebuilding our country! \u201cAt some point, and for the good of the country, I predict we will start working with the Democrats in a Bipartisan fashion,\u201d Trump tweeted days before Christmas. \u201cInfrastructure would be a perfect place to start. After having foolishly spent $7 trillion in the Middle East, it is time to start rebuilding our country!\u201d But, so far, Democratic lawmakers on Capitol Hill have been more willing to push their own $500 billion infrastructure plan \u2013 which they rolled out earlier this year.",

            "article_content": "The Republican plan to pass tax legislation by Christmas was considered laughable The GOP overhaul of the US tax system is slated to be signed by Trump this week Get the members off of Capitol Hill. That was the pitch from John Leganski, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy\u2019s 26-year-old floor director, to the more than two dozen Republican leadership staffers assembled around the long rectangular conference table at the back of Speaker Paul Ryan\u2019s office. It was less than two weeks until the rollout of the Republican tax framework, and anxiety about a redux of the failed health care effort was palpable across GOP offices on the Hill. At its core was a question that would become central to the tax bill\u2019s success: How do we do the exact opposite of everything we did on health care? That\u2019s where Leganski\u2019s idea took hold, several aides inside the meeting told CNN. When it came to the introduction of the Republican tax framework, Leganski reasoned, keep the members away from the press to limit their ability to attack the proposal right out of the gate. Perhaps more importantly, lock them into a conference room until everyone has had every question addressed \u2013 and every major concern mollified. House sends sweeping GOP tax bill to Trump's desk \u201cYou never get a second chance to make that first impression,\u201d one GOP aide said. \u201cAnd our first impression on health care was Republicans nuking their own bill the day it came out.\u201d The day the House GOP repeal-and-replace effort was unveiled, it was a matter of minutes before the circular firing squad unloaded. For taxes, Republican staffers quickly moved to set up an unofficial retreat \u2013 they kicked around Annapolis or Baltimore, before eventually settling on the National Defense University, a campus in Southwest Washington on the grounds of Fort McNair \u2013 where members of Congress always have access to facilities. The retreat would go off without a hitch 11 days later. And by the time it was over, even the conservative House Freedom Caucus was ready to endorse the proposal. If the first impression mattered, this was a rousing success \u2013 one that laid the groundwork for the passage of the landmark legislation just short of three months later. The story of how Republicans achieved something that just three months ago seemed as laughable as it was impossible \u2013 a sweeping overhaul of the US tax code before Christmas \u2013 is one defined by unexpected speed, tens of millions of dollars in outside spending and a series of lobbying and House-Senate parochial skirmishes. \u201cDid you believe we\u2019d ever be at this day, with this bill, on this floor, with the outcome that we know is going to happen?\u201d McCarthy asked reporters before the House vote Tuesday; Ryan quipped, \u201cLet\u2019s see a show of hands.\u201d Ryan: Most important bill passed in decades By Wednesday afternoon, the Republican tax bill had cleared Congress \u2013 a half-day later than expected due to procedural snags in the Senate, but no less of a major legislative accomplishment, which the White House plans on celebrating with a ceremony shortly after the House passed it for a second, and final, time just before 1 p.m. ET. Alfredo Ortiz, the president and CEO of the Job Creators Network said candidly, \u201cmany thought that this would be something that would be taken care of in the spring of next year,\u201d even as he had advocated to do it by Christmas. But most of all, the passage of the bill is rooted as much in the GOP\u2019s health care failure as it is in devotion to a particular policy agenda. This recounting comes from interviews with more than two dozen lawmakers, senior aides, administration officials and lobbyists deeply involved in the process. It\u2019s a plan that leans heavily on dramatic changes for businesses, first among them a sharp 14 percentage point cut to the corporate rate. On the individual side, the benefits are less robust, but shown to provide a tax cut, on average, for every income class in the near term. The standard deduction is doubled, as is the child tax credit. In the plan\u2019s first year, 80% of households would get a tax cut, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation. But the plan has been pilloried by Democrats and panned in public opinion polls for its perceived shortcomings \u2013 the individual cuts expire after eight years. RELATED: What\u2019s in the GOP\u2019s final tax plan \u201cLet me be clear, this tax bill will be an anchor around the ankles of every Republican,\u201d Sen. Chuck Schumer, the Democratic leader in the chamber, told reporters Tuesday. \u201cIf they haven\u2019t learned it yet, they\u2019re going to learn it next November. Republicans will rue the day they pass this bill and the American people will never let them forget it.\u201d The percentage of total cuts lean toward the wealthy. Even accounting for growth, it potentially adds $1 trillion to the deficit. And the corporate overhaul underscores a key split in economic ideology of the two parties: The permanent benefits are designed to bolster economic growth, and along with it, wages. It\u2019s a result that relies heavily on outside economic factors simply out of Republican control. Yet Republicans \u2013 spurred by legislative failure and electoral uncertainty, united behind a central belief in the efficacy of tax cuts and bolstered by a White House that, unlike with its health care push, served as a unifying, as opposed to divisive, force \u2013 pushed through the $1.5 trillion proposal. \u201cI was worried about tax reform. I was very worried that we\u2019d come back and do the same thing we did on health care,\u201d said Sen. John Kennedy, a Republican from Louisiana. \u201cBut it didn\u2019t happen, and about 25% of the way through, I said, \u2018Ya know, we\u2019re going to put this one together. I can tell.\u2019 It just felt completely different.\u201d Across the Capitol, Republicans were also licking their wounds from the stinging health care defeat \u2013 one in which the blame fell squarely at the feet of the 52 members of the GOP Senate. Fierce outside opposition \u2013 and a unified Democratic caucus \u2013 succeeded in splitting the party on health care. Democrats would once again be on the sidelines in both the House and Senate as Republicans pursued a partisan process always designed to allow passage by a simple majority vote in the chamber. They would need to fend off another concerted effort to sink the legislation by a unified Democratic caucus deeply opposed to the bill. But aides involved in the process recognized something immediately upon their return from the August recess, having been hammered by their constituents during their weeks at home: They had returned desperate to do something \u2013 anything. One Republican lobbyist recounted going to several fundraisers and asking members who was getting the blame for the health care failure back home. With their tax bill, Republicans prepare for a long-awaited win Contrary to the prevailing wisdom inside the Beltway that President Donald Trump had fumbled on health care with his lack of policy acumen and inconsistent positions, this lobbyist said: \u201cDonald Trump was not being blamed for being bad at his job. They were.\u201d Members were also hearing from donors. \u201cOh mercy, yes,\u201d Sen. Roger Wicker, R-Mississippi, said when asked whether he had heard from angry voters and donors back home. \u201cDonors want to think they are contributing to a winning campaign strategy and secondly that policy changes are going to result.\u201d It was a combination that sparked action that for 31 years, despite the efforts of both parties, had been blunted by an array of sacred cows and outside interests that for many, seemed likely to win the day this time around as well. It turned out the threat of doing nothing \u2013 and the unprecedented speed of the process \u2013 prevailed. \u201cBefore anyone could get too organized, the process was too far along,\u201d one lobbyist acknowledged. Yet the Senate had long been viewed as the biggest hurdle to the overhaul \u2013 a chamber with members that held disparate interests and constituencies to go along with their high regard for themselves and their own power. It\u2019s not a new dynamic \u2013 but it is one that aides acknowledge historically creates difficulties. \u201cThere is some ego. It\u2019s not secret in the Senate there are a couple of jerks and there are a few people who think they are the founding fathers,\u201d Kennedy said of his colleagues. It was with that in mind that McConnell and Senate Finance Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch crafted a strategy to put the onus on the members to get the bill across the finish line. Hatch deputized four colleagues on the committee right after the election, from across the range of the conference \u2013 Sen. Pat Toomey to marshal conservative support, Sen. Rob Portman for his bona fides with the more moderate members, Sen. Tim Scott for his relationship with the freshman class, and Sen. John Thune, a member of leadership. The four would play a crucial negotiating role \u2013 and serve as de facto point men for Hatch and his team, led by staff director Jay Khosla, as they attempted to navigate the different asks and concerns raised by members in the weeks that followed. But it went further than that \u2013 as September moved along daily staff meetings and twice-a-week member meetings turned into specific assignments for the senior staffers of each Finance Committee member. Each would take ownership of a specific piece of the tax proposal \u2013 then present to the entire group. It was night and day from health care, aides recounted, noting that that process was largely sequestered inside a small group of senators and smaller group of staffers \u2013 leaving senators without buy-in, or in some cases, the policy know-how to handle the rapid fire opposition that followed that bill\u2019s release. In health care \u2013 where a working group had been appointed \u2013 there had been circular discussions that went on without any resolution and no one at the end of the day to make the call. The week before the committee was scheduled to take up the tax bill, Hatch and McConnell expanded the group \u2013 bringing in rank-and-file Republican senators in groups of six or eight for presentations with Hatch, Sen. John Cornyn, the second-ranking Republican, and staff. Just before the final markup, McConnell came to a meeting of Hatch and committee members and stressed the need for unity \u2013 without explicitly saying they should stick together and punt away any Democratic amendments that could endanger the bill; the message was clear and it worked. While Trump may not have been receiving the lion\u2019s share of the blame back home in the states and districts of various Republican members, on Capitol Hill there was no shortage of pointed \u2013 if generally anonymous \u2013 criticism directed his way for his health care efforts. To diminish Trump\u2019s role, particularly in its marked departure from health care, where he at one point called the House bill \u201cmean\u201d and continued to claim it contained provisions that it simply did not, would be to shortchange efforts that, unorthodox as they may have been in a traditional sense, were enough to help the bill across the finish line. RELATED: Trump confirms he called health care bill \u2018mean\u2019 Times Trump denied the tax plan would help him A primary reason? According to several people involved in the process, it\u2019s that he was significantly more conversant on taxes than he ever appeared to be on health care. That was put on display one night in late September, just a day before the final framework was set for release. Trump hosted dinner with a handful of leading conservative activists and voices. It came just a few days after he declared war on the NFL for its players kneeling for the national anthem. As the participants were served their beef Wellington, Trump ticked through the NFL fight and his pleasure with the response. But then, according to two attendees, he pivoted to a concise topline summary of the various pieces of the tax bill. \u201cThe thought we all had was: \u2018Huh, this is different than health care,\u2019\u201d one participant said. By the time their apple pie and cinnamon ice cream was served for dessert, several were convinced that the leadership from the very top could be an asset in the process. Trump\u2019s efforts weren\u2019t overwhelming, but they were targeted \u2013 he was cited by several Senate aides as particularly helpful in persuading Sen. Ron Johnson, who was both frustrated and at one point opposed to the Senate bill due to its treatment of pass-through entities. (Johnson\u2019s role was one that frustrated not just staff, but members: \u201cHere we go\u201d Sen. John McCain joked audibly, to chuckles from other senators, when Johnson started to pull out papers to talk about the tax bill shortly before the conference committee kicked off, according to two sources with direct knowledge of the closed-door meeting. But aides did note one thing, if grudgingly: Despite that frustration, Johnson did get what he wanted into the final bill.) When McConnell or Ryan needed Trump to weigh in, it wasn\u2019t long before he was on the phone with a lawmaker, aides recounted. Trump was also cited as helping bring Sen. Rand Paul, a frequent golfing partner and the junior senator from Kentucky, on board. Trump\u2019s relationship with the rabble-rousing House Freedom Caucus also moved the process along. During an interview in his office Tuesday, House Freedom Caucus Chairman Mark Meadows pointed to a signed and framed letter he has hanging on his office wall from Trump as an early indicator of just how different tax reform was going to be for the conservative group than health care was. Meadows and Ohio Rep. Jim Jordan had sent the memo to Trump before the budget vote with a list of six principles they wanted out of tax reform. The principles had been a few things Meadows had discussed at lunch with Larry Kudlow and Stephen Moore. \u201cWe got on the same sheet of music with the administration,\u201d Meadows recalled. \u201cAll of those things weren\u2019t agreed to, but it provided a framework for us to have a bill that could be passed.\u201d Trump sent the letter back with a note on how they were going to get it done and his signature. Meadows framed it. That\u2019s not to say Trump\u2019s efforts were viewed as seamless on Capitol Hill. On multiple occasions, aides described Trump traveling for a weekend, either to New York or Mar-a-Lago, and when he returned, there would be new requests from the White House to bring down the top individual tax rate. Several aides described frustration with the President\u2019s use \u2013 or lack thereof \u2013 of the bully pulpit as poll numbers on the bill continued to dip into the low 30s and high 20s. \u201cCan you imagine how the Obama or Bush administration would\u2019ve been on this bill? Relentless,\u201d one senior GOP aide said. \u201cEvery day. Every media platform. Every opportunity. You guys would\u2019ve gotten so annoyed with the repetition that you would\u2019ve been begging us to pass it just so it would all stop.\u201d And the Trump administration? \u201cYeah, so the deep state stuff hasn\u2019t exactly been that, has it?\u201d Still, Trump\u2019s White House took a different approach this time around. Cohn was particularly cognizant of the member dynamics in the Senate, and Shahira Knight, Trump\u2019s special assistant on tax policy, was lauded by several participants on both sides for her role. 7 reasons why Republicans may have made a bad bet on the tax bill Meanwhile, those close to the process noted that Trump\u2019s early use of Treasury Secretary Steve Mnuchin hadn\u2019t been entirely smooth. \u201cGary Cohn\u2019s engagement was actually better received by members in both chambers than perhaps Secretary Mnuchin,\u201d one member said. One area where Mnuchin got clear credit: his insistence on the aggressive post-August recess timeline. One that, in the end, despite doubts around the Capitol, proved right. For Speaker Ryan, a full-scale overhaul of the tax code was a culmination of sorts of a life\u2019s work. A congressional aide and think tank policy staffer, turned 20-something congressman who rose to the top of the tax writing House Ways and Means Committee, Ryan long envisioned he would be drafting the final bill. The resignation of House Speaker John Boehner in 2015 changed that trajectory \u2013 Ryan would end up not just atop a committee, but the whole House \u2013 but the goal remained, with a new point person at its helm: Rep. Kevin Brady. RELATED: Why John Boehner quit The two formed somewhat of an inside-outside tandem; Brady and his staff working on the nuts-and-bolts policy as Ryan worked both the rank-and-file members of the conference and the outside interests that would be crucial to an eventual victory. \u201cKevin Brady on not just the policy side, but his demeanor through this process, stands out to me,\u201d said Rep. Mark Walker, the chairman of the conservative Republican Study Committee. \u201cDare I say it was presidential and something that, from the White House to the outhouse, we could all maybe do better maybe if we followed his lead.\u201d There were off-the-record calls to powerful conservative media hosts like Sean Hannity and Rush Limbaugh, outreach to business groups like the National Federation of Independent Business and the National Association of Realtors. Each call, sources recounted, was designed to sell, coax, soothe or undercut any hint of opposition. One conservative activist familiar with the process said \u201cas the wheels were falling off the Obamacare repeal effort or right after, we started working much more closely with leadership for the first time in a long time. We had conversations with the speaker\u2019s office, we met with Ways and Means staff and we continued that relationship right up to the end and it was nice.\u201d The source described one meeting in Ryan\u2019s office the night before the House unveiled its bill as a highlight of the process. After years of sparring with Boehner and even Ryan at points, it was a rare moment of agreement. The meeting included about a dozen folks and Ryan and his key staff. \u201cWe got to pepper him with questions, and he answered them to the best of his ability,\u201d the conservative activist remembered. At the end of the day, it wasn\u2019t as much a d\u00e9tente as it was the mere fact that tax reform was finally a shared goal. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t try too hard to find some magical reason that all of this happened; it comes down to, this is a much easier issue for Republican to unite behind,\u201d the conservative said. And it was Ryan who, just days before the final unified tax framework was released, was on the phone with Trump talking him down as he, according to several sources involved, threatened to sink the entire process over frustration that the corporate rate wouldn\u2019t be set at 15%, underscoring a relationship that evolved to a point of closeness that once seemed unimaginable. At various points in the process, Ryan and Trump were speaking by phone as many as two or three times a day, aides said. RELATED: A 15% corporate tax rate could be very expensive Brady and Ryan didn\u2019t align on everything \u2013 Brady preferred more money to be plowed into expensing, Ryan more for lower rates, for example \u2013 and there was constant talk of whether one was undercutting the other (and if Ryan was the one actually running the whole show). But aides in both camps pushed back on the idea; each had a specific lane and their own member relationships that helped bolster the process throughout. Unlike health care, where members recounted in private meetings to Brady and Republican leadership that they\u2019d felt hung out to dry by the process, this time the two would take pains \u2013 from the conference retreat through the whole process \u2013 to establish buy-in early, and not just in their chamber, but in the Senate and in a White House that for the initial months of the Trump administration never appeared to have a single point of contact to establish what its position on any particular issue actually was. More importantly, both were largely in agreement on the policy, which was based on a House blueprint crafted the year prior. What is a border adjustment tax? Yet early on in the tax overhaul process, both were wedded to a policy that, despite broad alignment on the overall plans, fractured Republicans and the outside groups queued up to support them. Border adjustment \u2013 the linchpin of the House GOP plan \u2013 would have imposed a levy on imports, and exempt exports altogether. But it was a flashpoint for many members, with opposition by monied outside industries like retailers, car dealers and perhaps most importantly, Koch Industries Inc., and the outside group aligned with billionaire brothers Charles and David Koch \u2013 Americans for Prosperity. The plan lingered for months. The White House was loath to support it, even as Ryan and his team repeatedly made their case that it was the best, and at that point, only option to create more than $1 trillion in revenue to pay for the bill. It\u2019s demise \u2013 GOP leaders announced its death by omitting it from a joint statement at the end of July \u2013 helped spark the progress that was to come. The joint statement officially killing the border adjustment tax marked one of the first major public statements of what became known as the \u201cBig Six\u201d \u2013 a name the participants didn\u2019t like, but the shorthand that stuck for the group that included Ryan, McConnell, Brady, Hatch, Mnuchin and Cohn, the director of Trump\u2019s National Economic Council. It was a group of big personalities and differing strategies \u2013 Mnuchin was described as wanting to dig into the weeds as much as possible, much to the chagrin of other principals who expected to be deployed only on the major decisions, and perhaps more importantly, wanted the details to be left not to a top-down group, but to the respective conferences. McConnell pushed for releasing as little agreed-upon detail as possible \u2013 better to leave opposition and industries with limited detail to shoot at, he reasoned to other participants, according to sources involved. Ryan and Brady pushed for a middle ground of sorts \u2013 framework that would serve to peg the future legislative process to specific goals and metrics. That would win the day. In the weeks that followed, the speed with which the process moved stunned even the most seasoned aides and outside advocates. Several aides pointed to the aggressive timeline and made one thing clear: There was no margin for error. Each week had been mapped out with check points. Should Republicans miss a single one, the bill would slip into the unknown of an election year. And yet, \u201conce it was to the actual legislation, they did not have a single hiccup,\u201d said Tim Phillips, the president of Americans for Prosperity. Republicans had plenty of help on that front. American Action Network spent more than $24 million on its campaign to advocate for the bill, targeting 64 different districts with 25 unique ad campaigns on television, digital, radio and mobile billboards. They served as a clearinghouse of sorts for several key outside conservative groups, lawmakers, key staffers and administration officials with regular meetings at their offices. The largest outside business advocacy groups \u2013 including the US Chamber of Commerce and the Business Roundtable \u2013 launched sustained campaigns to keep lawmakers on track. RELATED: Stocks surge as investors cheer corporate tax cut The Job Creators Network, an outside group founded and funded by billionaire Home Depot co-founder Bernie Marcus, lined up with former House Speaker Newt Gingrich to consult on messaging strategy \u2013 focus on \u201ctax cuts,\u201d Gingrich told the president/CEO of the group, not \u201ctax reform.\u201d More importantly, Ortiz said, the focus from all the groups, his included, centered on a single principle: Don\u2019t sink the bill over one or two disliked provisions. \u201cWe knew these bills weren\u2019t perfect,\u201d Ortiz told CNN. \u201cBut we knew they were good.\u201d Yet the legislative success has yet to translate into any semblance of public support. Outside groups, like Phillips\u2019, spent much of the process on making sure the members themselves were aware of the stakes \u2013 AFP held more than 80 town halls in states and districts of GOP lawmakers to rally the grassroots support behind the effort and launched digital ad campaigns on conservative websites. \u201cYou\u2019re not trying to move public opinion,\u201d Phillips said. \u201cWhat you\u2019re trying to do is build support from within to motivate.\u201d However effective the outside strategy, one thing was clear \u2013 the Democratic efforts to peel off potentially wavering Republican senators, and the repeated attacks on the bill\u2019s corporate focus or perceived failings on its directed cuts for the middle class, fell short. Even still the lessons from the past kept Republicans on edge. George Callas, Ryan\u2019s senior tax counsel and a crucial player in the effort, had taken to sending around the video of Dallas Cowboys defensive lineman Leon Lett fumbling right before the goal line in the 1993 Super Bowl as warning not to celebrate too early. But the Republican Party was unified behind tax cuts. That strategy will now have to shift, top Republicans acknowledge, into a full sales effort \u2013 one GOP leaders say will be bolstered by near-term effects of the bill that will be hitting paychecks as soon as February. \u201cWe\u2019re just beginning to make the argument to the American people,\u201d McConnell told reporters Tuesday. As for Ryan, he would have his moment gaveling down a victorious vote on a tax overhaul, twice, it turned out, after procedural snags forced technical changes the Senate bill Tuesday night. And he remained steadfast about what the policy he\u2019d been advocating for over decades would do in the end. \u201cThis is a promise this majority made,\u201d Ryan said Tuesday. \u201cThis is a promise this majority is keeping.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Democratic Sen. Al Franken of Minnesota is resigning following allegations that he touched women inappropriately, he announced in a speech on the Senate floor Thursday. Read Franken\u2019s full remarks: A couple months ago, I felt that we had entered an important moment in the history of this country. We were finally beginning to listen to women about the ways in which men\u2019s actions affect them. The moment was long overdue. I was excited for that conversation and hopeful that it would result in real change that made life better for women all across the country and in every part of our society. Then the conversation turned to me. Over the last few weeks, a number of women have come forward to talk about how they felt my actions had affected them. I was shocked. I was upset. But in responding to their claims, I also wanted to be respectful of that broader conversation. Because all women deserve to be heard and their experiences taken seriously. I think that was the right thing to do. I also think it gave some people the false impression that I was admitting to doing things that in fact I haven\u2019t done. Some of the allegations against me are simply not true. Others I remember very differently. I said at the outset that the ethics committee was the right venue for these allegations to be heard and investigated and evaluated on their merits. That I was prepared to cooperate fully and that I was confident in the outcome. You know, an important part of the conversation we have been having the last few months has been about how men abuse their power and privilege to hurt women. I am proud that during my time in the Senate, I have used my power to be a champion of women. And that I have earned a reputation as someone who respects the women I work alongside every day. I know there is a different picture of me painted over the last few weeks, but I know who I really am. Serving in the United States Senate has been the great honor of my life. I know in my heart that nothing I have done as a senator, nothing has brought dishonor on this institution. I am confident that the ethics committee would agree. Nevertheless, today I am announcing that in the coming weeks I will be resigning as member of the United States Senate. I, of all people, am aware that there is some irony in the fact that I am leaving while a man who has bragged on tape about his history of the sexual assault sits in the Oval Office and a man who has repeatedly preyed on young girls campaigns for the Senate with the full support of his party. But this decision is not about me. It\u2019s about the people of Minnesota. It\u2019s become clear that I can\u2019t both pursue the Ethics Committee process and at the same time remain an effective senator for them. Let me be clear. I may be resigning my seat, but I am not giving up my voice. I will continue to stand up for the things I believe in as a citizen and as an activist. But Minnesotans deserve a senator who can focus with all her energy on addressing the challenges they face every day. There is a big part of me that will always regret having to walk away from this job with so much work left to be done. But I have faith that the work will continue because I have faith in the people who have helped me do it. I have faith in the dedicated, funny, selfless, brilliant young men and women on my staff. They have so much more to contribute to our country. And I hope that as disappointed as they may feel today, everyone who has worked for me knows how much I admire and respect them. I have faith in my colleagues, especially my senior senator, Amy Klobuchar. I would not have been able to do this job without her guidance and wisdom. I have faith or at least hope that members of this senate will find the political courage necessary to keep asking the tough questions and hold this administration accountable and stand up for the truth. I have faith in the activists who organized to help me win my first campaign and who have kept on organizing to help fight for the people who needed us. Kids facing bullying, seniors worried about the price of prescription drugs, Native Americans who have been overlooked for far too long. Working people who have been taking it on the chin for a generation. Everyone in the middle class and everyone aspiring to join it. I have faith in the proud legacy of progressive advocacy that I have had the privilege to be a part of. I think I have probably repeated these words 10,000 times over the years. Paul Wellstone\u2019s famous quote, the future belongs to those who are passionate and work hard. It\u2019s still true. It will always be true. And most of all, I have faith in Minnesota. A big part of this job is going around the state and listening to what people need from Washington. But more often than not, when I\u2019m home, I am blown away by how much Minnesota has to offer the entire country and the entire world. The people I had the honor of representing are brilliant and creative and hardworking and whoever holds this seat next will inherit the challenge I have enjoyed for the last 8.5 years being as good as the people you serve. This has been a tough few weeks for me. But I am a very, very lucky man. I have a beautiful healthy family that I love and that loves me very much. I\u2019m going to be just fine. I just would like to end with one last thing. I did not grow up wanting to be a politician. I came to this relatively late in life. I had to learn a lot on the fly. It wasn\u2019t easy and it wasn\u2019t always fun. I\u2019m not just talking about today. This is a hard thing to do with your life. There are a lot of long hours and late nights and hard lessons and there is no guarantee that all your work and sacrifice will ever pay off. I won my first election by 312 votes. Could have easily gone the other way. Even when you win, progress is far from inevitable. Paul Wellstone spent his whole life working for mental health parity and it didn\u2019t pass until six years after Paul died. This year, a lot of people who didn\u2019t grow up imagining that they would ever get involved in politics have done just that. They have gone to their first protest march or made their first call to a member of Congress or maybe even taken the leap and put their names on a ballot for the first time. It can be such a rush. To look around a room full of people ready to fight alongside you. To feel that energy. To imagine that better things are possible. You too will experience setbacks and defeats and disappointments. There will be days when you will wonder whether it\u2019s worth it. What I want you to know is that even today, even on the worst day of my political life, I feel like it\u2019s all been worth it. Politics, Paul Wellstone told us, is about the improvement of people\u2019s lives. I know that the work I have been able to do has improved people\u2019s lives. I would do it all over again in a heartbeat. For a decade now, every time I would get tired or discouraged or frustrated, I would think about the people I was doing this for and it would get me back up on my feet. I know the same will be true for everyone who decides to pursue politics that is about improving people\u2019s lives. And I hope you know that I will be fighting alongside you every step of the way. With that, Mr. President, I yield the floor.",

            "article_content": "Republicans are on the verge of passing a historic tax measure It appears Trump's inner circle is also being targeted by the Russia probe No wonder the President is lashing out. Donald Trump waited 10 long months for the vindication of his first legacy-boosting win on Capitol Hill \u2013 the Senate vote on tax reform. But his triumph, when it came, was tainted by his worst moment as President \u2013 the plea deal ensnaring fired national security adviser Michael Flynn that epitomizes special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s relentless march closer to the Oval Office. In recent days, the strands that define this political era of incredulity and turmoil, including the tax bill, the Russia investigation and the escalating threat of war with North Korea, have come together at a frenetic moment that will shape the environment ahead of the midterm elections next November, but also the 45th President\u2019s place in history. Russia investigation zeroes in on Trump inner circle Republican efforts to finally get the tax bill to Trump\u2019s desk by the end of the year coincide with an ominous turn of the Mueller probe after Flynn became the fourth Trump associate to be charged, raising the possibility he could testify against the President, and his son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and son Donald Trump Jr. One of the key questions following Mueller\u2019s strike against Flynn on Friday was how Trump would react. Predictably, the President exploded on Twitter, denying wrongdoing, slamming his own FBI and casting doubt on whether justice would be served by Mueller\u2019s investigation. \u201cI had to fire General Flynn because he lied to the Vice President and the FBI. He has pled guilty to those lies. It is a shame because his actions during the transition were lawful. There was nothing to hide!\u201d he tweeted Saturday morning. In another tweet, he said the FBI\u2019s reputation is in \u201ctatters.\u201d I had to fire General Flynn because he lied to the Vice President and the FBI. He has pled guilty to those lies. It is a shame because his actions during the transition were lawful. There was nothing to hide! After years of Comey, with the phony and dishonest Clinton investigation (and more), running the FBI, its reputation is in Tatters - worst in History! But fear not, we will bring it back to greatness. And it all backfired, adding to the impression that Trump is often his own worst political enemy and suggesting that Mueller is sowing panic in the White House and undercutting the notion that the President\u2019s incessant tweeting is the secret of his success. Trump worsened the fallout from the Flynn plea with a tweet from his account on Saturday that said he fired his former close aide earlier this year because he had lied to Vice President Mike Pence and the FBI over conversations with Russian officials. The comment set off a political firestorm and raised the question of whether he had effectively and inadvertently admitted to obstructing justice. If Trump knew that Flynn had lied to the FBI when he asked James Comey in February, by the former FBI director\u2019s own account, to go easy on his fired national security adviser, he could be seen as advocating a cover-up of a crime. Trump lawyer John Dowd eventually insisted that he, and not Trump, had written the tweet. CNN legal analyst Michael Zeldin said Sunday that Dowd would have tweeted in the first place only if Trump had asked him to do so, or he had made a \u201cterrible mistake.\u201d \u201cIt did create a huge mess for the President as a consequence of it,\u201d said Zeldin, who said he did not believe it was possible that Trump knew Flynn lied to the FBI when he fired him. Tracking the Russia investigations The episode hinted at the extreme pressure and even panic being generated inside the West Wing with each stride that Mueller takes, a state of mind apparently also reflected in Trump\u2019s wild weekend tweets. Another tweet also appeared to dig Trump deeper into the legal and political mire. \u201cI never asked Comey to stop investigating Flynn. Just more Fake News covering another Comey lie!\u201d Trump tweeted on Sunday. I never asked Comey to stop investigating Flynn. Just more Fake News covering another Comey lie! On its own, the tweet does not incriminate Trump, but it exemplifies the legal peril in which he now finds himself. That\u2019s because if he repeated that statement under oath to Mueller\u2019s team, it would set up a direct clash with the sworn public testimony of Comey, who said, with the support of contemporaneous notes, that Trump did indeed ask him to end the Flynn investigation. If the President repudiates his own position, he would be effectively admitting trying to interfere in a federal investigation. Either scenario could pose grave legal and political risks to Trump and his presidency. And both raise a fateful question: Why was the President so keen to thwart the Flynn investigation, and what does the former national security adviser know about alleged election collusion with Russia that he is now compelled to tell Mueller? Comey took to Twitter himself Sunday evening to fire back at Trump, recycling a quote from his congressional testimony in June. \u201cI want the American people to know this truth: The FBI is honest. The FBI is strong. And the FBI is, and always will be, independent.\u201dMe (June 8, 2017) pic.twitter.com/OZ1ZiBrMNL \u201cI want the American people to know this truth: The FBI is honest. The FBI is strong. And the FBI is, and always will be, independent,\u201d Comey tweeted. California Sen. Dianne Feinstein exemplified the darkening storm around the White House in an appearance on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d \u201cWhat we\u2019re beginning to see is the putting together of a case of obstruction of justice,\u201d said Feinstein, the top Democrat on the Senate Judiciary Committee, which is conducting its own Russia investigation. The weekend of deepening intrigue over the Mueller investigation robbed the President of a chance to get full political value for the Senate\u2019s vote on tax reform. \u201cWe are one step closer to delivering MASSIVE tax cuts for working families across America,\u201d the President tweeted on Saturday morning, trying his best to mark the most momentous legislative moment of his presidency. We are one step closer to delivering MASSIVE tax cuts for working families across America. Special thanks to @SenateMajLdr Mitch McConnell and Chairman @SenOrrinHatch for shepherding our bill through the Senate. Look forward to signing a final bill before Christmas! pic.twitter.com/gmWTny3SfS While the tax reform measure is highly controversial, saw long-time fiscal conservatives repudiate their past as deficit hawks and is branded by Democrats as a massive giveaway to the rich at the expense of the middle class, it will rate as a significant victory for Republicans when the House and Senate versions are combined and sent for Trump\u2019s signature. The bill is the most far-reaching reform of the tax code since the Reagan era. It finally offers validation for the GOP\u2019s monopoly on Washington power. GOP candidates at last have a win to sell to midterm voters. It is a measure that will stand with Trump\u2019s name in history and also revives the reputation of Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who saw his aura as a master of the Senate dulled by the failure to pass an Obamacare repeal bill. When Trump signs the measure, as now seems likely, his critics will no longer be able to mock him for lacking a single big legislative win during his first year in office, the time when a president\u2019s power is at its apex. However, it is too soon to assess the enduring political impact of the tax bill. Republicans believe that provisions including a 15% cut in the corporate tax rate will ignite a golden economic era, previewed by the impressive rate of 3.3 % growth in the gross domestic product in the third quarter, which represents one of the bright spots of the Trump presidency. \u201cWe are in a global competition. We must win that competition, which means that our tax code must be competitive with the rest of the world,\u201d South Carolina Republican Sen. Tim Scott told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper on \u201cState of the Union.\u201d \u201cWhen that happens, American companies will churn out more profits, more revenues to the government, and we will be able to deal with our national debt,\u201d he said. If Scott is correct, the stock market will extend its bull run, more Americans will be working and companies will be opening new factories, providing a favorable economic environment for Republicans as they head into midterm elections. Those Republican voters souring on Trump\u2019s volatile behavior may give him a pass in his re-election bid if he is delivering roaring prosperity. But this is a key moment for Democrats as well. Top party officials sense a political opening, believing the measure will bloat the deficit by more than $1 trillion and cause corporations to use their windfall for share buybacks and dividends rather than invest in their own operations to create more jobs. They accuse Trump of turning his back on the white working class on which he built his political base, hoping to stifle the Republican renaissance in the Midwest. They also predict that the bill will cause the GOP to slash the beloved social programs that Trump vowed in 2016 to protect. \u201cMr. President, you told the American people time and time again you were not going to cut Social Security, Medicare and Medicaid,\u201d Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, an independent who vied for the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination, said Sunday at a rally in Reading, Pennsylvania. \u201cToday, get on the phone. Tell Paul Ryan, tell Mitch McConnell that you will veto any bill that cuts Social Security, that cuts Medicare, that cuts Medicaid,\u201d Sanders said. As domestic politics and Mueller\u2019s threat to Trump dominated a weekend of cascading political developments, there was a new twist to the third dominant issue demanding the administration\u2019s attention \u2013 North Korea. The current national security adviser, H.R. McMaster, warned that the prospect of a conflict that could be one of the most devastating in decades and even go nuclear was \u201cincreasing every day.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Despite the hurdles facing the Senate tax plan, only one Republican voted against it Sens. Rob Portman, Orrin Hatch, Tim Scott and Pat Toomey lobbied hard for the bill Republicans are finally on the verge of enacting a signature legislative achievement. It\u2019s something that seemed up in the air less than 24 hours before the vote, unlikely just a few months ago and completely unfathomable despite bold claims to the contrary midway through President Donald Trump\u2019s first year in office. Yet the Republican-controlled US Senate, by a vote of 51-49, early Saturday morning passed a historic overhaul of the US tax code, clearing what has long been considered the largest and most byzantine hurdle in an effort that hasn\u2019t been completed in more than 31 years. \u201cWe have an opportunity now to make America more competitive, and to keep jobs from being shipped offshore and provide substantial relief to the middle class,\u201d McConnell told reporters after the vote. \u201cAt the end, there was not a single Democrat who thought this was a good idea, and so we\u2019re going to take this message to the American people a year from now.\u201d Trump sounded a jubilant note Saturday morning, thanking Republican lawmakers on Twitter for their work on the bill. Biggest Tax Bill and Tax Cuts in history just passed in the Senate. Now these great Republicans will be going for final passage. Thank you to House and Senate Republicans for your hard work and commitment! The White House, too, lauded passage of the legislation Saturday morning, saying in a statement that the senators who voted for the bill \u201cdid a great service to their constituents\u201d and adding that the legislation would lead to \u201csustainable economic prosperity and job creation.\u201d \u201cWe have a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to reclaim America\u2019s great destiny,\u201d the statement read, adding that the administration looked forward to enacting the legislation by year\u2019s end. The legislative product \u2013 something that will touch every facet of American life, every US business and every individual in the country \u2013 came from a year of closed-door, cloistered meetings. It was driven by GOP goals of significant cuts and benefits to corporate entities designed to turbocharge economic growth, with significantly less benefit to the individuals who have been at the heart of the Republican pitch for the plan itself. It was created without the inclusion of Democrats and it came on the heels of a devastating failure on what has been the Republican Party\u2019s top legislative priority for more than seven years: the repeal of Obamacare. Just hours before the bill was voted on, aides were still writing the bill. When the final bill emerged, notes were still hand-written and scribbled in the margins. The Senate is about to vote on a tax bill pretty much nobody has read Yet, McConnell lost just one Republican vote, something even senior GOP members would deem almost inconceivable just a few weeks ago. After rushing the bill through a release and a markup, GOP leaders also survived a late, and completely unexpected, scare that nearly stalled a tax bill on the brink of passage. The bill is now expected to go to conference committee with House. The story of how Senate Republicans closed the deal, which despite the roaring success of Republicans up to this point, still faces challenges in the days ahead as lawmakers in both chambers attempt to reconcile proposals that differ sharply in several key substantive ways, involves multiple Republican senators negotiating with other members right up until the final moments before the vote. To tell that story, CNN spoke with dozens of lawmakers, administration officials, aides and lobbyists directly involved in the process, most of whom requested anonymity to candidly discuss the process. The speed with which GOP leaders recovered from Thursday night\u2019s scare on the bill was emblematic of the entire process. Expectations of potential doom from the lobbyists and outside advocates who watched the process like hawks quickly were overcome by the phoenix-like nature of a legislative priority that for decades has flummoxed both parties. As the proposal took another step forward, Republicans were candid about what appeared to be the accelerant behind the effort: political imperative. The idea that passing something \u2013 anything \u2013 was better than protecting a single provision or a single industry. How the bill survived started at the top with McConnell. After a tumultuous August in which Trump chastised the Senate leader frequently on Twitter for failing to deliver the votes on repealing Obamacare, McConnell kept his powder dry. In speeches across Kentucky, McConnell didn\u2019t disparage Trump and returned to Washington ready to work with a partner whose style was the antithesis of McConnell\u2019s say-less, focus-more approach. A source familiar with their discussions told CNN that after a meeting shortly after Labor Day, Trump and McConnell began speaking at a clip more frequent then at any other point in Trump\u2019s presidency. \u201cDaily,\u201d the source told CNN. The two men divided and conquered, with McConnell asking Trump explicitly for help trying to convince Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin and Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul to vote for the tax bill. Eventually it was just Sen. Bob Corker, a Republican from Tennessee who won\u2019t seek re-election in 2018 and has often sparred with Trump, who voted against the proposal, citing concerns that the bill would add too much to the country\u2019s deficit. Corker had made his support contingent on leaders including a trigger in the bill that would generate automatic tax cuts in the event the tax bill didn\u2019t get the anticipated growth. But after reworking the proposal several times, the Senate parliamentarian ruled that the trigger wouldn\u2019t pass Senate rules that allowed Republicans to pass their tax bill along a party-line vote. Corker then demanded $350 billion in additional cuts his colleagues weren\u2019t ready to give him. RELATED: Bob Corker\u2019s $1 trillion tax reform problem But even Corker, who had left aides and colleagues fuming Thursday night with a dramatic showing on the Senate floor that included him huddled around the Senate\u2019s parliamentarian and GOP leaders for more than hour, offered conciliatory remarks Friday morning at a closed-door GOP conference meeting. According to two GOP sources, Corker moved to de-escalate the situation that angered his colleagues Thursday night, saying he was happy the party was on the precipice of passing their tax bill even if he wasn\u2019t going to be with them. Republican leaders as of Friday morning were still trying to win his support, but sources acknowledged the reality: the decision had been made to cut him loose. They had the votes without him. \u201cThis is yet another tough vote,\u201d Corker said in a statement Friday. \u201cI am disappointed. I wanted to get to yes. But at the end of the day, I am not able to cast aside my fiscal concerns and vote for legislation that I believe, based on the information I currently have, could deepen the debt burden on future generations.\u201d Earlier Friday morning, Sens. Steve Daines of Montana and Johnson had announced their support for the tax bill after leadership promised they\u2019d include a provision in the tax bill that increased the tax break for pass-through entities from 17.4% to 23%. Johnson\u2019s conversion to a \u201cyes\u201d vote on the bill was perhaps the most hard-fought \u2013 and frustrating \u2013 for Republican leaders. For weeks he\u2019d expressed discontent about being left out of the process. He didn\u2019t just want to address the pass-through issue, he wanted to overhaul the Republican approach to it altogether. At one point, he appeared willing to stall the bill out in committee just to prove his point. It was the President himself \u2013 someone regularly maligned by Republican senators and staff alike \u2013 who helped bring Johnson along, multiple aides and administration officials said. It was in an exchange, shortly before the committee vote in a closed-door meeting of Republican senators and Trump, where Johnson vented his frustrations in front of everyone. Trump listened, engaged occasionally, dismissed once (\u201cOh c\u2019mon, Ron,\u201d Trump said at one point, according to two people in the room) and didn\u2019t take personally an unusual slight: Johnson declined to stand when addressing Trump in the meeting, breaking bipartisan tradition. When Johnson finished, Trump said bluntly: \u201cThat\u2019s not a reason to vote against the bill, Ron.\u201d But it was another part of the exchange that others said added clarity to what would eventually occur: Johnson complained nobody ever listened him. Trump countered that he did. And he was right. Trump administration officials, and the President himself, had been working with Johnson behind the scenes for days. And he had help from inside the Republican conference. Sen. David Perdue, a freshman senator from Georgia and former CEO, was also reaching out to Johnson \u2013 by phone over the Thanksgiving break, at another point on the Senate floor. He reported back to the President \u2013 with whom he\u2019s formed a close relationship over the course of the year \u2013 giving him another source on where Johnson really stood on the proposal. What Johnson wanted, however, hadn\u2019t yet come the night before the final vote: a more generous expansion of the pass-through tax rate cut than Republican leaders were willing to offer to get he and Daines on board. He would get it by the next morning. Leadership also won over Sen. Susan Collins of Maine \u2013 a senator who helped kill the GOP\u2019s Obamacare repeal efforts and who many considered out of reach on the tax bill. But several aides say Collins, unlike health care, made clear to McConnell she wanted to get to \u201cyes\u201d on the tax legislation. The two had several private meetings. She made her concerns known \u2013 and the specific things she would need to come along, including the inclusion of the state and local tax deduction for property taxes, capped at $10,000, which had previously been repealed in the bill. Republican leaders, including the President at the closed-door conference meeting, solidified her support by giving her assurances that they\u2019d push for an Obamacare market stabilization bill in upcoming weeks. \u201cHaving secured these key improvements in the bill, as well as the commitments to legislation to help lower health insurance premiums, I will cast my vote in support of the Senate tax reform bill,\u201d Collins said in a lengthy statement before the final vote. A final boost for GOP leaders: Sen. Jeff Flake, who like Corker had been pushing hard for the deficit \u201ctrigger\u201d idea. He too would come on board, even without the trigger, when his concerns over the sunset of the expensing provision in the bill were addressed. He was also given assurances by Vice President Mike Pence that he would be involved in the negotiations over how to handle a solution for halting the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, which Trump pledged to end by March. The success of 11th-hour horse-trading represents a massive win for McConnell, who spent months haunted by the conference\u2019s inability to repeal and replace Obamacare in July. After 11 months, Senate Republicans finally delivered on a core election promise. For their part, Senate Democrats were unified in their opposition \u2013 and their disdain for the proposal. They took to the floor, member after member, for three days \u2013 attacking the proposal for being too weighted toward corporate interests, fiscally irresponsible and produced through a process that was equal parts scattershot and secretive. Sen. Richard Durbin, an Illinois Democrat, waved a page of a draft version of the proposal with handwritten changes to in the margins at one point to demonstrate what he attacked as a haphazard process. Others seized on the bill\u2019s $1.5 trillion price tag \u2013 and the lack fo any nonpartisan analysis that said the growth created by the proposal could cover that cost, as Republicans had pledged. \u201cMy Republican friends will ultimately pay the consequences for this bill in 2018 and beyond. The Republican Party will never again be the party of tax cuts for the middle class,\u201d Sen. Chuck Schumer, the Senate\u2019 Minority Leader, said on the Senate floor Friday evening. The victory on tax reform also represented a first step on dismantling Obamacare as well. On Friday, Senate Republicans managed to not only pass a tax reform bill, but also to deliver a first and crucial blow to the Affordable Care Act. The tax bill repealed the individual mandate, a provision that required individuals to purchase health care or face a fine, something that just four months proved too complicated for the conference. In a way, including the provision \u2013 which was the ultimate gamble for a conference that failed repeatedly to repeal it just months before \u2013 represented a double win for the party. Finally, Republican senators have done what their House colleagues and even their donors feared they couldn\u2019t: they\u2019ve finally passed a cornerstone piece of legislation. While Republicans had worked on various proposals to overhaul the tax code for decades, Republican senators began strategizing their latest attempt to reform the tax code not long after Trump stunned the country and won the White House. Republicans had a President ready and willing to sign a bill if they could manage to send him one. According to a source familiar with the tax negotiations, as far back as December 2016, a small group of Republican senators \u2013 all on the Senate Finance Committee and guided by Chairman Orrin Hatch and his staff \u2013 began hashing out the Senate\u2019s course. The group included Sens. Rob Portman, formally the director of the Office of Management and Budget, Sen. John Thune, a member of the GOP leadership, Pat Toomey, a fiscal conservative and a member of the Senate\u2019s Budget Committee and Sen. Tim Scott, a rising conservative star in the party. Over the next several months, the senators held what the source said must have been hundreds of meetings as they sought to find a way forward not only among fellow senators but in cooperation with the House of Representatives and Trump \u2013 who lawmakers widely acknowledge was more engaged and interested in tax reform than he had been on health care. \u201cThere\u2019s been an enormous amount of work done. The reason you see everybody looking so tired is because we are,\u201d said Sen. John Kennedy, a Louisiana Republican. \u201cThey did a great job of keeping us apprised so we wouldn\u2019t be surprised.\u201d It was those four senators\u2019 knowledge about the bill that made the effort successful, senators said. \u201cThe health care was sort of a committee of the whole and staff did most of the explaining,\u201d said Sen. Lamar Alexander. \u201cIn this case, you had the senators themselves more directly involved in writing and explaining and defending the bill and I think it\u2019s the principal reason why it succeeded.\u201d \u201cI think Sen. Toomey was born with a tax-reform bill in his bassinet, and Sen. Portman probably was too,\u201d Alexander added as he walked onto a Senate elevator. Republican senators widely credit the four senators with bringing the bill to the finish line. Sen. James Lankford, a Oklahoma Republican who desperately wanted a trigger like Corker, said he met regularly with them and that unlike on health care, where no one had ownership over the process, colleagues knew exactly who they could go to with concerns. \u201cThose four were really the front people who each took a section whether it be international taxes, whether it be business, whether it be individual. Each had their lane and everybody as they were going through it could run it through them,\u201d Lankford said. \u201cI don\u2019t mean this flippantly, they all did a good job.\u201d In the final days and hours of negotiations, sources familiar tell CNN, Portman played a critical role in helping his colleagues get comfortable with the bill. Just minutes before the Republican conference meeting Friday morning that would determine the fate of the bill, Portman could be seen standing outside the Strom Thurmond room in the Capitol for 10 minutes with Collins and the Senate\u2019s Majority Whip John Cornyn. The source familiar with the negotiation said that in the final three days, Portman met with Daines and Corker and dined for breakfast with Collins Wednesday just two days before the crucial vote. In the end, Republicans filled the chamber, anticipating the final vote. They slapped backs and shook hands. McConnell winked and pointed at the Vice President Mike Pence, who presided over the vote, a sign of relief after months of searching for that one legislative achievement. Democrats one by one voted and left, a protest to the process they abhorred. In the end their side of the chamber was empty and the vote tally was called: \u201c51 to 49,\u201d the clerk read. But in his news conference following the vote, McConnell dismissed Democrats\u2019 concerns, saying \u201cYou complain about process when you\u2019re losing.\u201d CNN\u2019s Kristin Wilson, Ashley Killough and Ted Barrett contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Their memo comes as GOP senators are poised to approve their tax bill They say the bill protects interests that are anathema to Trump voters President Donald Trump\u2019s tax reform push has handed Democrats a \u201cgolden opportunity\u201d to get past the party\u2019s internal divisions that have raged since last year\u2019s election, Hillary Clinton\u2019s and Bernie Sanders\u2019 campaign managers argue in a joint memo they\u2019re set to release Friday. Robby Mook and Jeff Weaver say in the memo that the tax effort is \u201calready resoundingly unpopular across just about every demographic,\u201d including the rural and suburban voters who flocked to Trump last year and the Democratic base voters who sat out the election. That has given Democrats a way to avoid having to decide which of those groups to pour money and organizing efforts into winning back in the 2018 midterm elections, they write. \u201cIt is quite a feat for Republicans to have designed a bill that could alienate Obama-Trump voters, Romney-Clinton voters and base Democrats all at the same time, but the tax plan achieves exactly this trifecta,\u201d Mook and Weaver write in the memo. \u201cShould the legislation reach President Trump\u2019s desk, the issue has the potential to doom Republican lawmakers who vote for it. If Democrats properly seize this issue, they can potentially win over most every swath of the electorate critical to next year\u2019s midterm elections.\u201d The memo comes with Senate Republicans poised to approve their tax bill on a narrow, party-line vote. Congressional Republicans have cast the bill\u2019s passage as crucial to delivering a tangible legislative victory to the base that handed them the House, Senate and White House in last year\u2019s elections. But Democrats \u2013 including Mook, now a CNN political commentator, and Weaver, who became something of a political odd couple near the end of the party\u2019s combative primary last year \u2013 see in it an opportunity to make an economic argument that could help heal the rifts over which voters the party most needs to court, at the expense of others, that have lingered since Clinton\u2019s loss to Trump. Mook and Weaver argue in their memo that the bill helps corporations and wealthy Americans and includes protections for special interests that are anathema to voters who bought into Trump\u2019s \u201canti-\u2018swamp\u2019 rhetoric.\u201d They point to the GOP\u2019s move to ditch the state and local tax deduction as one that will hike taxes on suburban households in states like New York, California, New Jersey and Pennsylvania \u2013 all of which have competitive House races in 2018. The proposed repeal of the Affordable Care Act\u2019s individual coverage mandate, which is included in the Senate bill, is likely to increase insurance premiums, they say. \u201cThe Republican tax plan is the rare piece of legislation that manages to provide something for nearly everyone to hate,\u201d Mook and Weaver say in the memo. The tax bill becomes more unpopular as voters are exposed to messages about what it would do, the memo says, citing polling from the Democratic super PAC Priorities USA. \u201cThe tax proposal is the best opportunity yet for Democrats to convince voters that Donald Trump and congressional Republicans are looking out for their wealthy donors, and not working-class Americans,\u201d Mook and Weaver write. \u201cThe widespread opposition to the Republicans\u2019 plan should reassure Democrats that they ought not engage in some false choice between different groups of voter targets,\u201d they write. \u201cOur party should compete everywhere, and seek to win over voters of all ages, education backgrounds and income levels by using the tax fight to illustrate the two parties\u2019 vastly different priorities. If Democrats seize this opportunity, congressional Republicans who support the tax plan will definitely be doing so at their own political peril.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Trump said GDP growth is at it highest \"in many years\" -- but it's only at its best since 2014 The GOP tax plan would cut taxes for 60% of those making $1 million per year in 2027, though Trump says it's \"going to cost me a fortune\" President Donald Trump pushed to rally support for the GOP tax reform plan in Missouri on Wednesday, but, during his speech, he stretched the facts, used misleading arguments and made false assertions to get there. It wasn\u2019t the first time Trump has made false or misleading statements. (The most recent count from the Washington Post pegs the number at 1,628 false or misleading claims over the last 10 months.) On everything from the impact of his proposed tax plan on the wealthy to the history of job growth and GDP numbers, Trump hyped the numbers beyond what the data really says. Still, Trump went on insist that, after the impact of the tax plan hits, \u201cthey\u2019re going to say that Trump is the opposite of an exaggerator \u2013 the exact opposite.\u201d Here are five false or misleading statements from the President during his latest tax reform speech. GDP growth of 3.3% is definitely a good quarterly rate \u2013 and better than it\u2019s been recently. But it\u2019s not even close to the largest increase \u201cin many years.\u201d It is the largest since 2014, when GDP grew by 4.6% in one quarter and 5.2% the next. In fact, GDP growth topped 3.3% a half dozen times under former President Barack Obama and 44 times in the last three decades, according to a CNN analysis of data from the Bureau of Economic Analysis. The United States did lose millions of jobs in 2009 during the Great Recession, according to employment numbers from the Bureau of Labor Statistics, but the nation has been averaging 1.9 million new jobs from October-to-October since 2010. The country has added 1.8 million jobs since Trump was elected in November. As CNN\u2019s Dan Merica and Jeanne Sahadi reported, from what we know about Trump\u2019s wealth and the core tenets of the Senate tax plan, he and his family almost certainly wouldn\u2019t be hit hard by the plan. The bill would lower taxes on most, if not all, of Trump\u2019s businesses. Plus changes to the estate tax and repealing the alternative minimum tax could also reduce Trump\u2019s tax load significantly. Meanwhile, the Joint Committee on Taxation says in 2019, more than eight in 10 taxpayers making $200,000 or more per year will get at least a $500 tax cut. And in 2027, when some of the proposed cuts would wear off, a majority of taxpayers making $1 million per year or more will still have a more than $500 tax cut, while the vast majority of those making less than $100,000 will have virtually no change or a tax increase. It\u2019s true that taxes would be cut for most, but not all, middle-class families initially \u2013 but those cuts won\u2019t last for most except in the highest of income groups. Majorities of all income groups making over $30,000 per year will see a tax decrease of at least $100 in 2019, according to the Joint Committee on Taxation. That includes 80% of both taxpayers earning $50,000 per year and $1 million per year. But in 2027, when some of the provisions would expire, only 14% of those earning $50,000 per year would still have that cut vs. 60% of those earning over $1 million per year. Politifact has taken a look at this claim from two different angles \u2013 one with inflation-adjusted dollars and another as a percentage of gross domestic product \u2013 and Trump\u2019s tax cuts don\u2019t mark the largest cuts from either perspective. \u201cEven the most expansive estimate for the current proposal\u2019s tax cut is exceeded by the 1981 tax cut in inflation-adjusted dollars. And as a percentage of GDP, a half-dozen or more previous tax cuts were larger,\u201d Politifact says.",

Luis Gutierrez announced his retirement plans and endorsed Cook County Commissioner Chuy Garcia in the coming Democratic primary, the country\u2019s largest socialist organization was mobilizing behind a candidate of their own. Chicago Alderman Carlos Ramirez-Rosa, a Democrat and member of the Democratic Socialists of America, jumped into the contest right alongside Garcia, kicking off a race that could vault a new crop of ambitious leftists \u2013 DSA\u2019s dues paying membership jumped to more than 31,000 from about 5,000 over the past year \u2013 into mainstream political prominence.

That means convincing voters that Ramirez-Rosa \u201cwould be better to represent not only the people from his district, but the people of the United States by representing a unique viewpoint that\u2019s sorely missing (in the House) since Sanders went to the Senate in 2006.\u201d Overnight, as rumors spread that Gutierrez would reverse course and stand down, and Ramirez-Rosa told CNN he planned to \u201cbegin circulating (paperwork) tomorrow\u201d if the seat came open, DSA members online reacted joyously \u2013 \u201cfolks are pumped,\u201d Ramirez-Rosa noted drily in a text \u2013 and began to bubble with plans to organize behind his campaign. PUMPED IS AN UNDERSTATEMENTSorry for yelling we just think Congressman Carlos Ramirez-Rosa has an amazing ring to it! https://t.co/dKEuGpYY56 In a statement early Tuesday morning, Ramirez-Rosa made note of his time working as a staffer for Gutierrez, then laid out his platform, a pledge to \u201cvigorously oppose President Trump\u2019s regime, and fight for the progressive policies that will uplift the 4th District\u2019s working families, including medicare for all, free college tuition, stopping deportations, and a $15 living wage.\u201d DSA is not a political party and does not make donations to candidates. It hasn\u2019t yet formally endorsed Ramirez-Rosa, though its support should become official in the coming days. Members are already working alongside the candidate as he hustles to collect the requisite signatures to assure his place on the ballot. The test will come as the race enters the new year \u2013 the primary is March 20 \u2013 and DSA\u2019s activist core is called on to mobilize voters. Comrades! The first signature has been casted! Help us collect hundreds more tonight at 2959 N Milwaukee at 3:30PM pic.twitter.com/kT5s7Cg3ZH On the ground in Chicago, there is an early sense of confidence among organizers close to Ramirez-Rosa. They are counting on a surge of support from allies around the country, and betting that DSA\u2019s swarming and insistent social media presence \u2013 if you\u2019ve spent an hour on Twitter in the last 12 months, you\u2019ve seen their rose emoji emblem next to users\u2019 handles \u2013 will amplify his and their message. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of people here who already have the skills and the talents. We\u2019re all essentially organizers. That\u2019s what we do. So it\u2019s about putting out the rose signal and saying yeah, we\u2019re ready,\u201d Chicago DSA\u2019s Lucie Mac\u00edas said hours before Gutierrez made his announcement. By then, Mac\u00edas said she had already been swamped by members from in and outside the city hoping to volunteer on behalf of the campaign. Despite the excitement among activists, Ramirez-Rosa begins the race as a clear underdog. Separating himself from Garcia will be its own trial. Gutierrez in his remarks Tuesday made note of Garcia\u2019s close to ties to Sanders, suggesting he had a direct line to the senator, who had introduced a new recovery package for Puerto Rico earlier in the day. Garcia said his candidacy would \u201c(build) on the legacy of (former Chicago) Mayor Harold Washington, the foresight and energy that brought young people together for Sen. Bernie Sanders and the work of Rep. Gutierrez.\u201d Sanders\u2019 office did not respond to an email asking if he planned to endorse in the race. And our @CDRosa petitions have arrived. We\u2019re ready to start collecting at 3:30 pm at 2959 N. Milwaukee. #Rosa4Congress pic.twitter.com/JfDjwjwS0m The ties between Sanders and Garcia underline another challenge facing DSA \u2013 whether it can favorably definite itself against competition that looks similar at a glance. \u201cChuy has always been a good guy on our issues \u2013 it\u2019s a real win-win for progressives,\u201d Duhalde said. But in sorting out the candidates\u2019 relatively narrow differences, the organization has a unique opportunity to highlight its leftist political agenda \u2013 and test its electoral muscle. \u201cOne of the counter-narratives to DSA\u2019s recent success on election day was that anyone running as a Democrat or against the Trump agenda would have won,\u201d Duhalde said. \u201cCarlos is a more challenging test. Can DSA actually help people get elected or make a huge difference in their campaign, aside from just the anti-Trump message?\u201d With less than a week until the filing deadline and only a few months before voters head to the primary polls, the answer isn\u2019t far off.",

            "article_content": "Ron Johnson said he would vote no on the Senate plan unless there are changes Susan Collins has also expressed reservations about Republicans' tax plans In the US Senate, the tax bill could fail or succeed based off of the votes of just a handful of members. After recess this week, Senators will return from Thanksgiving and move immediately to vote on a plan that would permanently lower the corporate tax rate, temporarily lower rates across the middle-class and would drastically reshape the country\u2019s tax code. But, the math is tough. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is moving forward with a Senate process that only allows him to lose two members and still pass his bill. Already one member has announced he\u2019s opposed and another is leaning against the bill. That means that in the next two weeks, McConnell has to hold his conference together or be faced with yet another failure on one of the GOP\u2019s top campaign promises. Here are the players to watch. The Wisconsin Senator made major news last week when he became the first member of the Republican Party to come out against the Senate\u2019s tax bill. Johnson\u2019s problem with the legislation boils down to his concern about the way the Senate bill treats pass-through entities versus how it treats corporations. Under the bill, Johnson has argued that small businesses \u2013 many of whom use the pass-through structure to pay taxes\u2013 aren\u2019t getting a fair deal. GOP Sen. Ron Johnson to oppose tax plan \u201cI\u2019m just looking for a fair shake for all businesses to maintain the competitive balance and position of all businesses,\u201d Johnson told CNN, later adding: \u201cI\u2019m not for the current version.\u201d Businesses who use the pass-through structure to pay taxes range from small businesses to larger companies, but the term means that business profit is passed onto the owner of the company or the shareholders who then pay taxes as personal income. Johnson has said he could get to \u201cyes,\u201d but without Johnson\u2019s vote, McConnell can only lose one more Republican member and still pass his tax bill. When the Arizona Republican announced last month that he wouldn\u2019t be running for re-election, he solidified his wild card status for the remainder of his term. Flake has long been known for his opposition to President Donald Trump, and though Flake has supported a number of key Republican votes this year, he has still been harshly critical of the White House and refuses to tow the party line when it comes to messaging \u2013 making him unpredictable at times. Flake caught on hot mic talking about Trump Trump blasted Flake Sunday night on Twitter after the Arizona senator was caught criticizing Trump and Alabama Senate hopeful Roy Moore. Trump asserted that Flake was a \u201cno\u201d on tax reform, even though Flake hasn\u2019t definitively said how he\u2019ll vote on the bill. Flake reiterated his concerns Monday in a radio interview with KFYI that tax reform could explode the debt. \u201cSo I\u2019m going to balance this reform package with that in mind,\u201d he said. Flake said that \u201cwhat the President does or says or feels has nothing to do whatsoever with how\u201d he will vote on the tax bill. Collins has repeatedly cited her concerns about the tax bill in the past week. On CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union,\u201d the Republican from Maine reiterated Sunday her disapproval of the decision to include a repeal of the individual heath insurance mandate as a way to raise revenues. Collins wants to 'skew' tax bill away from rich \u201cI don\u2019t think that provision should be in the bill. I hope the Senate will follow the lead of the House and strike it,\u201d she said, arguing that the move would increase premiums and offset any tax relief for middle income families. Collins has established herself as an independent Republican who\u2019s not a guaranteed \u201cyes\u201d for her party on major bills. She opposed multiple attempts by Republicans this summer to repeal the Affordable Care Act, for example. When Republicans added the individual mandate repeal, all eyes also turned to Murkowski, who joined with Collins and Sen. John McCain to oppose similar legislation earlier this summer. Republicans, however, are optimistic that Murkowski will still sign onto the tax reform bill, even if it includes the health care provision. Lisa Murkowski saved Obamacare. But here's why she may not abandon Republicans on taxes That\u2019s because the tax bill, due to arcane Senate rules, will be combined with a bill that recently passed out of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee. Murkowski, who chairs the committee, has long tried to pass this bill, which approves drilling in Alaska\u2019s Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. Murkowski said Thursday that she worries about bringing the individual mandate into the tax reform debate. \u201cBoth pieces of those are complicated and together they become more complicated,\u201d she said. But Murkowski realizes that if she votes against the tax bill, she\u2019d be voting against opening up ANWR \u2013 \u201cwhich would not be something that I would want.\u201d So far McCain has not signaled any alarms that he might vote against the bill. While McCain has upheld his maverick status this year \u2014 teaming up with Collins and Murkowski to defeat the mandate repeal, for example \u2014 he hasn\u2019t expressed any major concerns about the tax reform bill. In a statement Friday, he applauded the Senate Finance Committee for passing the bill through \u201cregular order,\u201d meaning it spent four days in markup and considered amendments. That was not the case with the health care bill effort this summer and it was a big reason why McCain voted against it in the end. Still, McCain has made it clear that he wants to see the entire bill, including any changes to it that might happen on the Senate floor, before he states his position. So Republicans still consider him a wild card until they have a better idea of what exactly McCain wants to see in the bill. The Tennessee Republican has said all along he will not support a bill that adds one penny to the deficit, but Corker hasn\u2019t come out as a definitive \u201cyes\u201d or \u201cno\u201d on the tax bill just yet. Republican tax plan state of play: 401(k) change out, Corker in the hot seat Part of the reasons is that Corker is concerned about how the Senate tax bill is structured. In the bill, many of the individual tax breaks that help the middle-class would expire in 2025. That\u2019s done in order to ensure the bill doesn\u2019t add to the deficit outside the 10-year window, which is not allowed under Senate rules if Republicans want to pass it with a simple majority. But it\u2019s more of a budget gimmick.  Republicans have said that when the time comes, they won\u2019t really let the cuts expire, but that has created cause for concern for lawmakers like Corker who has made fiscally responsible tax cuts a condition of his vote. \u201cI met with Mnuchin today. I continue to talk to the tax writers. I haven\u2019t spoken to a single piece of policy on it. It\u2019s just a broader picture of, you know, I just want to make sure this is something that is going to strengthen our country over time,\u201d Corker told CNN last week. \u201cBut I haven\u2019t taken a position on the bill yet. I\u2019m still working with folks to see if there is some way to be ensured that, as it relates to the deficit issue, we\u2019re not going to create harm.\u201d Few lawmakers are the kind of wild card that Sen. Rand Paul, whom leadership is keeping a close eye on but isn\u2019t sure they will be able to convince, is. After suffering severe injuries after a neighbor allegedly attacked him, Paul has not been as visible on Capitol Hill as he\u2019s been in debates past, but he remains a key vote. Here\u2019s what we know: Paul had been one of the members who demanded that the repeal of the individual mandate be included in the tax bill. That provision was added last week. But, that doesn\u2019t mean we can automatically assume Paul will be a\u201dyes.\u201d When asked whether the Kentucky Republican supports the bill, an aide to Paul told CNN on Monday, \u201cHe will likely support.\u201d CNN\u2019s Ted Barrett and Phil Mattingly contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "The Senate committee behind tax reform is marking up a GOP bill this week Attorney General Jeff Sessions is also testifying before a House panel The House of Representatives is expected to vote this week on a major tax reform bill, a top GOP policy goal that lawmakers say is a must-pass after they failed to repeal and replace Obamacare and are now a year ahead of the 2018 midterms with little to show for total control of Congress. Republican leaders in both Congress and the administration argue that middle class workers will all see tax relief, but Democrats argue the proposal is too tilted toward wealthy Americans. Congress hasn\u2019t been able to move any significant changes to the tax code in more than 30 years. McConnell to NYT: I \u2018misspoke\u2019 on tax increase for middle class in Senate plan Adding to the issues Republicans on Capitol Hill have to address: Fallout from the bombshell story in The Washington Post last week that Alabama GOP Senate nominee Roy Moore pursued sexual relationships with teenage girls when he was in his early 30s. Many Republican lawmakers were quick to say he should drop out of the special election if the allegations are true. But Moore has consistently blasted the coverage as attacks from the \u201cliberal media\u201d and shows no signs of leaving the race. Expect GOP members in both chambers to continue to be pressed to answer what, if anything, they\u2019ll to do in response. Washington reacts to Roy Moore allegations The House GOP bill overhauling the tax system scales back the number of tax brackets, cuts the corporate tax rate to 20%, aims to simplify the code and eliminate many tax breaks. As of the end of last week, Republican leaders don\u2019t yet have the votes to pass the legislation. Several Northeast Republicans say they still have major concerns with the bill, which repeals a popular deduction for state and local income and sales tax as well as caps property tax deductions at $10,000. RELATED: Millions in the middle class will feel it if GOP kills this tax break This group and potential other holdouts may be able to secure even more changes to the bill, but any tweaks alter a complicated calculus because leaders need to keep the price tag at no more than $1.5 trillion in order to use special rules to avoid a Democratic filibuster in the Senate. More changes can be added when the House rules committee meets Wednesday and sets the parameters for the debate on the floor at the end of the week. But by and large, Republicans in the House have been able to portray a united front so far, with several high-profile conservatives coming out to support the bill. Members of the typically hard-to-please House Freedom Caucus have expressed support for the bill. Even Rep. Thomas Massie, a Kentucky conservative who voted against House Speaker Paul Ryan\u2019s reelection to the leadership post earlier this year, told CNN he was a \u201cyes.\u201d The key question now is if the goodwill will hold, as Republicans from many suburban districts are faced with a floor vote on a measure that some worry could end up being a political liability in the 2018 midterm elections. RELATED: All the weird parts of the tax reform bill, in one post In the Senate, Republicans will begin marking up their tax plan in the finance committee, a process that is expected to take several days. But obstacles \u2013 especially those that come with arcane Senate rules \u2013 abound. While the Senate bill met its target of costing no more than $1.5 trillion in the 10-year window, initial estimates found the bill would add to the deficit outside the 10-year window. That isn\u2019t allowed under Senate rules if the GOP wants to pass the bill with a simple majority. Leadership aides acknowledged that the Senate plan would still need to undergo some changes in upcoming days in order to pass the muster of the Senate parliamentarian. A verdict could come down in the corruption trial of New Jersey Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez. In a bizarre twist, one juror deliberating on the case was released by the judge last week and publicly revealed that she was planning to find the senator was innocent of charges of bribery. The judge replaced the juror, who had a long-planned vacation, and directed an alternate and the rest of the jury to essentially start over in deciding Menendez\u2019 fate. It\u2019s unclear how the unusual public peek inside the jury will play out. But this ex-member, who participated in the nine-week trial, predicted there were others who didn\u2019t believe the government proved Menendez did anything illegal and the trial would end in a \u201chung jury.\u201d If the senator is found guilty, it will put pressure on Democrats to call for him to step down. But with a slim margin of control of the chamber, a major tax vote, and other year-end measures coming up, he could stay and maintain that he could keep his seat during an appeals process. Attorney General Jeff Sessions will testify before the House judiciary committee Tuesday and is likely to face tough questioning about his testimony on his interactions with Russian officials during his tenure as a surrogate for the Trump campaign. Several Democratic senators maintain that Sessions was not entirely forthcoming about his communications, and his omission about one meeting at his confirmation hearing caused him to recuse himself from the ongoing investigation into Russia\u2019s meddling in the 2016 election. Rinat Akhmetshin, the Russian-American lobbyist who was one of the eight people at the June 2016 Trump Tower meeting between Donald Trump Jr. and a Russian lawyer, appears before the House intelligence committee on Monday. The committee earlier this month interviewed Ike Kaveladze, another Trump Tower meeting attendee. The House intelligence committee on Tuesday is interviewing Fusion GPS co-founder Glenn Simpson. The committee had previously issued a subpoena to Simpson and his partners for testimony, but Simpson and the panel struck an agreement last week for him to testify voluntarily. The two sides are still battling in court over Fusion GPS\u2019s bank records. Trump sarcastically responds to Kim Jong Un insults Senate foreign relations committee Chairman Bob Corker, a strong critic of President Donald Trump, holds a hearing next Tuesday on the use of nuclear weapons at a time when the Trump administration is dealing with a major confrontation with North Korea. The House will vote next week on an annual defense authorization bill. The bill, finalized by House and Senate negotiators last week, would authorize defense spending that exceeds federally mandated budget caps. But the legislation does not create a new \u201cspace corps\u201d initially proposed in the House version of the bill, an idea opposed by key senators and the Pentagon.",

            "article_content": "Trump and Putin will not formally meet in Vietnam, the White House said But they informally chatted a multiple times President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin will not hold a formal meeting at the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit here in Vietnam, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders has told reporters. But the two world leaders did informally speak a couple times during the two-day meeting. Trump and Putin were seen casually talking while walking to a photo-op at the Asian-Pacific Rim summit on Saturday. Flanked by sizable entourages, the two spoke for much of the walk down to a vista and stood next to each other for a photo. The chat, while brief, looked friendly, with both leaders speaking with their hands. Any interaction between the two world leaders is closely watched given the swirl of investigations into Russia\u2019s meddling in the 2016 election, an issue that has plagued the Trump administration for months. Special counsel Robert Mueller\u2019s investigation issued his first indictments last week, bringing charges against former top Trump campaign aides Paul Manafort and Rick Gates, who have pleaded not guilty. Trump and Putin also shook hands and spoke briefly before an APEC plenary session on Saturday and the two world leaders briefly met during a so-called class photo on Friday night, where all the heads of state come together to take a photo before the summit officially starts. The two shook hands and briefly spoke before the photo was snapped. Both wore the oversized, blue traditional-style Vietnamese shirt provided by the host country and stood next to one another for the picture. Citing \u201cscheduling conflicts on both sides,\u201d though, Sanders said Friday no formal meeting will take place during the two-day gathering. She did leave the door open to informal interactions between the two, a notion reinforced by her Russian counterparts. \u201cRegarding a Putin meeting, there was never a meeting confirmed, and there will not be one that takes place due to scheduling conflicts on both sides,\u201d Sanders said Friday. \u201cThere is no formal meeting or anything scheduled for them.\u201d She added: \u201cNow, they\u2019re going to be in the same place. Are they going to bump into each other and say hello? Certainly possible, and likely. But in terms of a scheduled, formal meeting, there\u2019s not one on the calendar and we don\u2019t anticipate that there will be one.\u201d Sanders\u2019 statement contradicted what the Russian side told reporters for the last two days, adding to the drama around how Trump and Putin will interact at the international summit. \u201cThe meeting will take place on the sidelines,\u201d Putin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Friday after Sanders\u2019 statement, adding that some encounter will take place \u201cone way or another.\u201d The possibility of a formal Trump-Putin meeting hung over the economic summit.   Trump has long denied any collusion between his campaign and Russian operatives during the 2016 election. But US intelligence agencies concluded in a report released earlier this year that Russia ordered an \u201cinfluence campaign\u201d to harm Hillary Clinton\u2019s chances of winning the election. The delicateness of the Putin-Trump meeting was laid bare on Thursday \u2013 before Sanders\u2019 statement \u2013 when the two sides gave dramatically different accounts on whether the two leaders would even meet in the first place. Russian presidential aide Yuri Ushakov told state-run news organization Itar Tass that Putin and Trump would meet on the sidelines of the Asia-Pacific summit on Friday, adding that the two sides had already agreed to the time and place. While briefing reporters in China, though, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson declined to say whether Putin and Trump would meet in Vietnam, telling reporters that officials are working to determine whether the two world leaders have sufficient areas of substance to discuss. \u201cWhen the two leaders meet, is there something sufficiently substantive?\u201d Tillerson said. \u201cNo conclusion has been made on that.\u201d Given the intense focus on any interactions between Trump, his associates and Russian operatives, the meeting \u2013 particularly what is said and not said \u2013 could overshadow the focus of Trump\u2019s trip to Vietnam, where the President is set to discuss business, trade and security with an array of Asian leaders. Possible Trump-Putin meeting still under discussion, Tillerson says One cause for concern on the American side is how Trump and Putin\u2019s first meeting on the sidelines of the G20 summit in Germany caused a diplomatic dust-up over whether Trump accepted Putin\u2019s assurances there was no Russian involvement in the 2016 American election. Trump opened his first sessions with Putin by \u201craising the concerns of the American people regarding Russian interference in the 2016 election,\u201d Tillerson told reporters after the bilateral meeting. \u201cThe President pressed President Putin on more than one occasion regarding Russian involvement. President Putin denied such involvement, as I think he has in the past.\u201d Tillerson didn\u2019t say whether Trump accepted his denial. But while Tillerson was briefing US media, Russian Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov told reporters that Trump accepted Putin\u2019s denial. The charge was immediately denied by a senior Trump administration official, but the turnabout signaled that any diplomatic engagement between the two countries would be complicated and fraught. Aboard Air Force One as he kicked off his five-country, 13-day trip throughout Asia, Trump told reporters that he \u201cexpected\u201d to meet with Putin on the visit because the United States hopes to enlist Russia in the fight against North Korea. \u201cWe want Putin\u2019s help on North Korea,\u201d he said. The first half of Trump\u2019s trip through Asia has primarily focused on how to deal with the rogue nation. Trump gave a direct and bellicose speech in South Korea about Pyongyang, at one point speaking directly to North Korean leader Kim Jong Un. \u201cNorth Korea is not the paradise your grandfather envisioned,\u201d he said. \u201cIt is a hell that no person deserves.\u201d Trump will continue to focus on North Korea in Vietnam, senior White House officials tell CNN, but his time at the summit will primarily focus on free trade. \u201cThe President\u2019s engagements at APEC will reinforce the US commitment to an equitable, sustainable and rules-based international economic system based on market principles,\u201d one official said.

            "article_content": "Last year, President Donald Trump\u2019s victory defied conventional wisdom and brought to a close a campaign that pitted the two most unpopular presidential candidates in the history of modern polling against one another. A year out from the election, Trump remains unpopular, as do the Democrats, the Republicans and Congress. Here is a look at where things stand. Trump has reached lows in his approval rating unseen by any president at this point in their presidency. As politics becomes increasingly stratified by party, presidents see sharper splits in their approval from people on different sides of the aisle. Former President Barack Obama, for example, ended his presidency with sky-high marks from Democrats and abysmal ones from Republicans. Trump sees the same dynamic, as expected. And like the Republican Party overall, Trump\u2019s support leans old, male and white. Much has been made specifically about his support from the white working class. The latest CNN poll showed Trump continues to perform slightly better among white people without college degrees than whites with them. Trump consistently earns high marks for strength. An October poll from Quinnipiac University is just one of the latest to enforce the trend. However, Trump has also consistently fared poorly on a number of other leadership qualities. The same poll enforced these trends as well, showing the public largely regards him as untrustworthy and not sharing their values. Additionally, an October poll from Marist University showed most people did not expect Trump to be the stellar president he promised. A plurality said he would go down as one of the worst in history. After Trump fired FBI Director James Comey, the Department of Justice appointed former FBI Director Robert Mueller to lead a special counsel investigation into all things Russia and any matters he should see fit to pursue in the course of that probe. Near the end of October, Mueller\u2019s team indicted two former Trump campaign hands and revealed a guilty plea from a former Trump adviser. The investigation continues, and an August poll showed many anticipated Trump would seek to put his thumb on the scale, and CNN\u2019s latest polling showed most disapproved of how he\u2019s handling the probe. The widely documented trend of increasing polarization \u2013 people moving further apart from one another by ideology and party \u2013 has continued in the wake of the election, as the latest study by the Pew Research Center finds. Pew asks people a series of simple questions about basic issues and sorts them by their answers. As the years go by, Pew is finding less commonality. In the lead-up to the election, the public was split on the country\u2019s direction, leaning toward saying it is going well. A year out, that split remains, but now it leans toward saying things are bad. Speaking at George Washington University in October, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said of her boss: \u201cHis numbers are a lot better than Congress.\u201d She\u2019s right. Congress remains very unpopular. Individual members of Congress tend to have higher approval in their individual districts among the constituents who know them. The political parties, likewise, have high unfavorable ratings. Control of Congress, the Senate and many governors\u2019 seats are up for grabs in the Midterm elections next year. The Senate map puts more Democrats on defense than Republicans, but after their massive losses last year, Democrats have argued they could take back Congress in a wave election. As this map shows, most voters will see statewide campaigns next year. Trump certified he was running for a second term just as his first began, and he\u2019s been campaigning for re-election since then, including raising money. Meanwhile, the party operations are building their warchests up to varying success. Here\u2019s their reported funding this cycle. On top of these totals are campaign arms like the Democratic Congressional Committee and the National Republican Congressional Committee, which have both amassed and allocated millions.",

            "article_content": "For the first time in more than three decades, New York City, a national liberal stronghold that historically balks at ideological leadership inside its own narrow borders, has re-elected a Democratic mayor \u2013 one with unabashed progressive politics and an eye on Washington. Mayor Bill de Blasio rewrote recent history despite having operated under near constant assault from the city\u2019s boisterous tabloid newspapers, while doing little himself to smooth over sometimes testy relations with eye-rolling New Yorkers. On Tuesday night, de Blasio pushed again for a new tax on the wealthy to help fund repairs to the city\u2019s troubled subway system, but won the most applause when he touted Democratic wins in the New Jersey and Virginia gubernatorial races. \u201cI bring you tidings of joy this evening, because America got a little fairer tonight, America got a little bluer tonight,\u201d de Blasio told supporters at a victory party in Brooklyn. Perhaps turning his attention to President Donald Trump, a native New Yorker, he added: \u201cTonight, New York City sent a message. You can\u2019t take on New York values and win, Mister President. If you turn against the values of your hometown, your hometown will fight back.\u201d De Blasio\u2019s road here was unlikely one. He shocked the city\u2019s political elite by emerging from a crowded Democratic primary in 2013 and, with a landslide victory on Tuesday, locked up a second term after a campaign run without a serious challenge from anyone inside his own party or, in this fall\u2019s general election, city Republicans, who all but ceded the race. For progressives in the Trump era, de Blasio\u2019s success represents new evidence to back an argument that ambitious, broad-based economic reforms \u2013 like those put forward by Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, who endorsed and campaigned with the mayor last week \u2013 can win over political skeptics and break through a wall of criticism from moderate Democrats and, in New York, the scrappiest of press corps \u2013 a group de Blasio has made little effort to pacify. \u201cThe tabloids are entertainment with a very small dose of news,\u201d de Blasio told CNN through a spokesman on Tuesday. \u201cNew Yorkers\u2019 political views are shaped much more dramatically by what they are feeling in their lives. They\u2019ll trust their own experience when it comes to universal pre-K, neighborhood safety, school improvement and what I\u2019m doing to keep their apartment affordable. They strain out the entertainment when push comes to shove.\u201d And there has been plenty of the latter \u2013 the sideshow amusements and screeching tabloid recriminations \u2013 during his nearly four years on the job. De Blasio was barely a month in office when he fumbled, literally, a stand-in for \u201cStaten Island Chuck,\u201d the city\u2019s answer to \u201cPunxsutawney Phil,\u201d during a public ceremony. The animal would later die, reportedly of internal injuries, leading to charges that the zoo, as a favor to the mayor\u2019s team, had as the New York Post then put it, initiated a \u201ccover-up.\u201d His morning schedule, which often takes him from Manhattan to his home borough of Brooklyn and a preferred gym, along with his late arrival at a 2014 memorial for victims of a 2001 plane crash in Queens, have provided fodder for countless aggrieved headlines. \u201cThey\u2019re always going to try and find something to just blow up and make bigger, but at the end of the day, when you look at the substance of de Blasio as mayor, and you look at the policies he\u2019s enacted, he\u2019s done a great deal to make this a more equitable city,\u201d said Rebecca Katz, a former top aide and adviser. \u201cNew Yorkers don\u2019t need a mayor who is warm and fuzzy, they need a mayor who will make their lives better.\u201d On that front, de Blasio scores high \u2013 or even up \u2013 with a diverse assortment of constituencies. Perhaps most surprising is the evolution of his relationship with the city\u2019s police, a fraught one that threatened to derail his mayoralty in its first year. After two officers were shot and killed while sitting in their patrol car in December 2014, hundreds of police turned their backs on de Blasio at the slain officers\u2019 memorial services. De Blasio\u2019s open discussion of a warning he\u2019d given his biracial son, telling him to be especially cautious if he were stopped by police, along with past criticism of controversial practices like \u201cstop and frisk\u201d and long-running labor angst all fed what seemed like a doomed alliance. But those concerns, a few notable blips aside, have mostly drifted into the background. In early 2017, he agreed to a new contract with the largest police union, which had been working without one for years. As election season approached, the union chose not to make an endorsement \u2013 which many scored as a political win for the mayor. \u201cHad they endorsed (Republican challenger) Nicole Malliotakis, it definitely would have been embarrassing,\u201d Christina Greer, an associate professor of political science at Fordham University, said on Monday. \u201cBut then again, he\u2019s given the police a lot. They asked for a few hundred more police, he gave them a thousand. They\u2019re supposed to do this (implicit bias) training, it hasn\u2019t begun yet. He promoted Jimmy O\u2019Neill, who is widely respected among the rank-and-file.\u201d In the meantime, controversial tactics like \u201cstop and frisk\u201d are all but gone and crime has continued to plummet. In an op-ed published this week, former police commissioner Bill Bratton called the combined work of the mayor and police a \u201cNew York City miracle.\u201d De Blasio\u2019s most prominent political success, though, came in delivering on his most deeply progressive campaign promise from 2013, a pledge to bring universal pre-kindergarten for four-year-olds. The budget deal, struck with Democratic Gov. Andrew Cuomo, delivered nearly $350 million in funds for the program. There is talk now of expanding it to include three-year-olds. \u201cIt\u2019s about kids,\u201d said the Working Families Party New York state director Bill Lipton, explaining the popularity of the program. \u201cLots of people understand that the science is on it is really solid and people support government when they believe are effective. People know the data on this. And the rollout was universally applauded. It demonstrated competence.\u201d Greer, a past critic of the mayor, said de Blasio\u2019s delivery of pre-K scored him points across class and race lines. \u201cWe know that it\u2019s helped working class New Yorkers, but I think it\u2019s also helped a lot of middle class New Yorkers stay in the city,\u201d she told CNN. \u201cThis helps a lot of two-income, middle class families that are making a good amount of money but might have either a new home or larger rental responsibilities or school loans\u201d and who might otherwise have considered leaving the city for cheaper real estate. The mechanics of the program, which by definition is \u201cuniversal\u201d and not targeted or means-tested, and its underlying ideology puts de Blasio in near political lockstep with Sanders, who appeared with him here last week. \u201cThis mayor is leading the city in a way to bring us together to create a better life for all of our people,\u201d Sanders said during an October 30 event. \u201cEverything that Mayor de Blasio is trying to do is exactly the opposite of what (President) Donald Trump is trying to do.\u201d De Blasio saluted right back, holding up Sanders as a progressive icon \u2013 one destined, as he put it, for greater glories still. \u201cThat day is going to come and when it comes you are all going to look back and say, who started this, who started the ball rolling, who started this movement, who planted the seed who gave us the hope, who showed us the way,\u201d de Blasio said. \u201cLadies and gentlemen, Bernie Sanders.\u201d Asked about his own future plans, de Blasio was predictably coy. \u201cI\u2019m entirely focused on being mayor of the greatest city in the world,\u201d he said on Tuesday afternoon. He\u2019s now guaranteed four more years to enjoy himself.",

            "article_content": "It\u2019s Donald Trump and the Republicans versus the Washington swamp\u2019s most devious predators in the legislative duel of a generation. By plunging into a majority-defining fight for tax reform, the White House and GOP leaders are pitting their wits against the most resourceful, well-funded, and experienced players of the inside Washington game. Ryan says Russia investigation not 'a distraction' to tax bill There\u2019s a reason that there\u2019s been no genuine tax reform bill passed for three decades. It\u2019s the same reason why many insiders believe that this attempt will be doomed, and eventually shrivel to the mere doling out of tax cuts. Tax reform sets up the ultimate duel between power brokers in the White House and Capitol Hill leaders, and lobbyists, special interests, industry groups, liberal campaigners, conservative think tanks, deficit hawks and any other pressure group that fears seeing a treasured tax break wither. \u201cGreat Tax Cut rollout today. The lobbyists are storming Capital Hill, but the Republicans will hold strong and do what is right for America!\u201d Trump tweeted Thursday night. Great Tax Cut rollout today. The lobbyists are storming Capital Hill, but the Republicans will hold strong and do what is right for America! \u201cLook, tax policy today is very swampy,\u201d said Rep. Tom MacArthur, a Republican who is not sold on the bill, owing to worries about mortgage interests and property tax deductions. CNN Money: What\u2019s in the House tax bill for people Within hours of the long-awaited bill being released on Thursday, some members were already feeling the heat, which will build day-by-day until the first crucial votes in the House and the Senate. \u201cLook, my phone\u2019s ringing,\u201d said Rep. Jeff Fortenberry, R-Nebraska. By Thursday evening, a collection of powerful industry groups had already lined up in an attempt to gut the legislation. \u201cSome of my best supporters, associations and stuff, don\u2019t like provisions in this tax cut,\u201d said Rep. Mike Simpson, a Republican from Idaho who has already heard opposition to the bill. \u201cEvery association that I know of has come into my office and said \u2018you know this tax reform is really important, we got to get this done except this one provision here.\u2019\u201d The National Association of Home Builders did not even wait for the bill to be published, after declaring war at the weekend after learning its pet credit was under fire. The bill would cap mortgage interest deduction $500,000, down from $1 million. \u201cThe House Republican tax reform plan abandons middle-class taxpayers in favor of high-income Americans and wealthy corporations,\u201d said NAHB\u2019s Granger MacDonald. The National Federation of Independent Business and National Association of Realtors also swiftly registered their displeasure. \u201cTax hikes and falling home prices are a one-two punch that homeowners simply can\u2019t afford,\u201d said the group\u2019s William E. Brown. \u201cThe nation\u2019s 1.3 million realtors cannot support a bill that takes homeownership off the table for millions of middle-class families.\u201d GOP leaders unveil key details in new tax plan But another lobby was declaring victory after the pensions sector killed off a bid to limit the amount of tax free cash Americans salt away in 401K plans, that angered Trump and caused industry outrage. CNN Money: House tax plan would kill the student loan interest deduction The contrasting fortunes of the two sectors exemplified the essential truth that every tax reform bill causes winners and losers. Sometimes the fight becomes so intense that legislative efforts simply get swamped and suffocate. Republican leaders acknowledge the fight ahead, but insist that, overall, this is a plan that will give a generational lift to the middle class, despite Democratic claims it is just another disguised giveaway to the GOP\u2019s rich friends. And if is passes it will mean more than a win for Trump. Will it may not count as draining the swamp \u2013 his core campaign promise will certainly qualify as a win over its most dangerous inhabitants. The President played Santa for Americans as he touted the bill that represents the best remaining chance he has to wrack up a genuine legislative victory this holiday season. \u201cWe are giving them a big beautiful Christmas present in the form of a tremendous tax cut,\u201d Trump said at the White House on Thursday. But Christmas cheer for Republicans will only come if lawmakers resolve to make difficult choices and tough votes that could put careers on the line. After meeting with Trump, GOP rules out DACA spending deal They face a daunting choice: defend the interests of donors and interest groups or actually pass a major bill they can campaign on. Many are arguing that in a year in which Congress has yet to send the President a major accomplishment, they are going to have to grit out the K street howls or face a grim reality: the return of Democrat Nancy Pelosi as House speaker. \u201cWe feel our mortality in holding office really weighing on this vote,\u201d said Rep. Tom Rooney, a Republican from Florida. \u201cPut it this way: If we don\u2019t pass this, we go into an election season without having a major piece of legislation passed with a majority in the House, the Senate and the White House. How do you go home and say \u2018vote for me for re-election?\u2019 We didn\u2019t do anything.\u201d The barren 10 months for the GOP majority has not just dismayed the GOP\u2019s conservative base \u2013 it has also dampened energy from an even more vital group \u2013 the big dollar donors who bankroll campaigns. But here again, it\u2019s the winners and losers equation that puts so much pressure on House Speaker Paul Ryan\u2019s rank-and-file. Tax legislation is always about difficult choices. This bill clocks in at 429 pages, and while it drops the corporate rate from 35% to 20% and doubles the standard deduction for individuals \u2013 targets of some lobbyists for years, it has to also offset the cost by closing various loopholes. That includes doing away with deductions for items like medical expenses or dozens of obscure breaks like one that allows pharmaceutical companies to write off research on rare diseases. \u201cAs Congress debates and refines this important legislation, we look forward to working with lawmakers to ensure that our nation\u2019s tax code most effectively encourages innovation, investment and American entrepreneurship,\u201d the Biotechnology Innovation Organization said in a statement. \u201cThis would include maintaining the Orphan Drug Tax Credit, and the inclusion of incentives for pre-revenue innovation and for the development of advanced biofuels, renewable chemicals and bio-based products.\u201d Senate Republicans call House tax proposal a good start Mark Meadows, a Republican from North Carolina and chairman of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, said that members must take a 30,000-foot view. He said for example that the bill would crush the mortgage interest deduction on second homes, and his district includes parts of Asheville, and the Nantahala National Forest, a popular tourist area. As an aside, noted that the lithium battery industry was also a loser because deductions for electric cars were cut out of the bill \u2013 another sign of the compromises a tax reform bill requires. \u201cWhen you look at some of those things, there will be people who will be strongly advocating and I think you have to look at it from a more holistic point of view,\u201d Meadows said. But such is the imperative for Republicans to get something, anything passed, after the debacle of their Obamacare repeal effort \u2013 the price of failure, this time, could be higher than the price of standing up to special interests. \u201cI don\u2019t think you are going to see lobbyists win the day here where they\u2019re getting back a bunch of little carve outs for industries,\u201d said MacArthur. \u201cI don\u2019t think so.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Sanders responded to criticism from Clinton He recently unveiled legislation to expand health coverage to all Americans Sen. Bernie Sanders on Sunday said he rejected criticism from Hillary Clinton that he and his supporters contributed to her defeat in last year\u2019s presidential election. \u201cI worked as hard as I could after endorsing Hillary Clinton,\u201d Sanders said on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press.\u201d Asked by host Chuck Todd if he accepted Clinton\u2019s criticism that his primary challenge to her and his sustained following helped elect President Donald Trump, the Vermont independent said, \u201cNo, I really don\u2019t.\u201d Sanders also brought up and rebutted a popular talking point that some of his supporters did not go on to vote for Clinton in the general election. He pointed out that a large portion of Clinton\u2019s supporters in the 2008 Democratic presidential primary went on to vote for Republican Sen. John McCain over Democrat Barack Obama. \u201cYou know people say, \u2018Well, not everybody who voted for Bernie ended up voting for Hillary.\u2019 No kidding,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cThat\u2019s what happens in politics.\u201d Sanders also said the re-litigation of the 2016 election was unproductive and that the Democratic Party needed to undergo a fundamental shift. \u201cThe current model of the Democratic Party is obviously not working,\u201d Sanders said. As Clinton began a raft of interviews and appearances to tout her campaign memoir, \u201cWhat Happened,\u201d Sanders spent the week rolling out his proposal to expand government health coverage to all Americans. A group of Democrats, many of them potential 2020 presidential hopefuls, joined Sanders and signed onto his effort. Sanders batted back criticism that his proposal to replace Obamacare with a single-payer system would help Republicans who pledged to repeal and replace the standing health care law. \u201cThe immediate concern is to beat back these disastrous Republican proposals,\u201d Sanders said. Inside Bernie Sanders\u2019 new \u2018Medicare for all\u2019 bill He said his Medicare for all legislation was about making a statement and setting a target for the US to join other nations in having the government guarantee health coverage. \u201cIt\u2019s not going to happen tomorrow,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cI fully admit that, but we need to put the benchmark down there and go forward.\u201d As for criticism that the program would be too expensive, Sanders said he believed it would reduce expenses on administrative costs relative to private insurance and allow for the negotiation of cheaper drugs. He also countered that an increase in the tax burden would be tempered for many by the elimination of insurance premiums. \u201cMy Republican friends say \u2018well, Bernie wants to raise your taxes,\u2019\u201d Sanders said. \u201cThey forget to conveniently mention that Bernie wants to do away with the private insurance premiums that you\u2019re now paying.\u201d Sanders went on to claim his legislation would save money for the average middle-class worker.",

            "article_content": "The House has to pass its tax reform bill before it goes to the Senate Some Republican senators have already criticized the proposal, but most held back Senate Republicans were largely buoyed Thursday by the release of a House Republican tax bill, a key step toward passing tax reform, one of their top legislative goals. They argued that tax reform would create jobs and jump-start the economy, even as they privately hope it will energize their party\u2019s midterm election chances, which faced a setback when their efforts to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act failed. While a couple of GOP senators raised questions about aspects of the House bill, most said they were pleased with the key elements and wanted to study the details before weighing in. READ: The Republican tax plan bill \u201cI don\u2019t think there a lot of surprises, but I don\u2019t really want to comment until I get a full grasp of what\u2019s been laid out,\u201d said Sen. Bob Corker of Tennessee, one of the few Republicans vocally skeptical of Congress\u2019s ability to pass tax reform without adding to the deficit. How three GOP senators will affect Trump's legislative legacy He said he hoped the tax reform would be permanent, something the House was not able to do with all its proposed changes, in part, to meet the Senate\u2019s strict rules related to deficit reduction if Senate Republicans want to pass a tax bill on a party-line vote. The GOP bill had to not cost more than $1.5 trillion in order to be acceptable under budget rules, and some of the tax changes many members pushed for would have put the cost over that threshold. \u201cOne of the attributes that we hoped would be there was permanence,\u201d Corker said. Sen. Marco Rubio, R-Florida, tweeted that he was disappointed by the size of the expansion of the child tax credit, from $1,000 to $1,600. He wanted it raised to $2,000. House #TaxReform plan is only starting point.But $600 #ChildTaxCredit increase doesn\u2019t achieve our & @potus goal of helping working families But he said he wasn\u2019t overly concerned about it because he sees the House proposal as just a place to start. \u201cI\u2019m not generally overall going to freak out the way everyone else is. It\u2019s a starting point,\u201d Rubio said. \u201cWhere we start and where we end are not going to be the same place.\u201d After the effort to roll back Obamacare fell apart, with the House and Senate GOP pursuing different strategies on that issue and ended up with no bill approved, House Speaker Paul Ryan, in an interview with CNN, insisted that tax reform would be different. \u201cWhat we wanted to do is make sure that we remove any kind of big disagreement and got on the same page, and that\u2019s what this reflects,\u201d the Wisconsin Republican told CNN\u2019s Phil Mattingly. Sen. John Cornyn of Texas, the Republican whip and a member of the tax-writing finance committee, praised the work of the House but the Senate would not be \u201cbound\u201d by it when senators begin work of their version. \u201cI think what the House did is instructive but we\u2019re not bound by what the House did. But there\u2019s been a lot of discussion so there is going to be, I would say, a fair amount of commonality,\u201d he said. \u201cBut not completely.\u201d Finance Chairman Orrin Hatch, R-Utah, said he couldn\u2019t \u201cwait to get it, look it over, and see if we can take it or amend it and make it better.\u201d He said he personally believes that the House limits on mortgage interest deductions to the first $500,000 in value should be in the bill. That proposal could be controversial in parts of the country with high real estate values. Sen. Richard Shelby, a Republican from Alabama, where real estate prices are lower than many other states, agreed. \u201cWhat we\u2019re trying to do is encourage home ownership. But $500,000? Most places you can buy a nice home. If you\u2019re going to lower rates, you\u2019re going to have to take away other things that have put in the tax code. I think we\u2019re on the right path. I can live with it,\u201d he said. Sen. Dean Heller of Nevada, who is facing a tough reelection next year, said he needed more time to study the House bill before saying what he thought. \u201cIt\u2019s on my desk and I\u2019m going through it as we speak,\u201d he told a reporter. \u201cI\u2019ll get back to you later.\u201d Most Democratic senators blasted the House bill, arguing it would raise taxes on the middle class and give big breaks to the wealthy. \u201cThis bill is about giving enough crumbs to the middle class to distract from the multi-trillion dollar giveaways to corporations that ship jobs overseas and the mega-wealthy,\u201d said. Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Oregon, a member of the finance committee. \u201cRepublicans are repeating the same mistakes they made with health care. It\u2019s the same old playbook: jam through a bill, cobbled together in a back room, that sticks it to hard-working Americans,\u201d said Sen. Patrick Leahy, D-Vermont. \u201cRepublicans are desperately seeking a \u2018win\u2019 in Congress, but this one would only come at great cost to the American people.\u201d These are the key people who control tax reform in Congress One Democrat that President Donald Trump and other Republicans have tried to convince to vote for the bill sounded skeptical. \u201cI\u2019m not ruling out support it,\u201d West Virginia Democratic Sen. Joe Manchin said before being able to read details of the bill. But later he put out a statement that was highly critical of it. \u201cThe tax reform proposal unveiled today does not pass this test and does not reflect the goals President Trump and I have discussed over the last several months,\u201d he said, before adding the he would continue to work to improve the bill.

            "article_content": "The House Speaker was among Republicans who just announced a new tax plan Paul Ryan says it will help the economy by giving the middle class a tax break House Speaker Paul Ryan told CNN in an exclusive interview Thursday shortly after the release of Republicans\u2019 new tax bill that the Russia investigation is not hindering any of Congress\u2019 work. \u201cI don\u2019t see it as a distraction,\u201d he told CNN\u2019s Phil Mattingly on Capitol Hill. \u201cWe have Russia investigations right here. We have a Russia investigation in the House, there\u2019s a Russia investigation in the Senate, oh and by the way, we can walk and chew gum at the same time.\u201d RELATED: GOP leaders unveil key details in new tax plan He continued: \u201cTwo guys getting indicted for something they did before the presidential campaign is not going to derail tax reform.\u201d Ryan was referring to the news that former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort and former Trump campaign official Rick Gates surrendered Monday to Justice Department authorities following a 12-count indictment. The two have pleaded not guilty. It was revealed that former Trump campaign foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos pleaded guilty to making a false statement to the FBI after he lied about his interactions with foreign officials close to the Russian government, the campaign\u2019s clearest connection so far to Russia\u2019s efforts to meddle in the 2016 election. When asked about his earlier remarks when he said he had \u201cnothing to add\u201d on news about the indictment, he clarified that he wants to let Justice Department special counsel Robert Mueller do his job. \u201cI have since come up to speed on these indictments because I think I needed to do that, but at the same time, I\u2019m not going to stop everything else we\u2019re doing to fix the country\u2019s problems. That\u2019s the point I\u2019m trying to make,\u201d he said. \u201cLet Mueller do his job, let the professionals do their job, this is our justice system and the justice system needs to play itself out.\u201d He also pressed that the goal of the new tax plan is to help the middle class. \u201cI\u2019m sure that some biased groups, maybe from the left, will come up with their own modeling,\u201d he said. \u201cBut it\u2019s very clear and obvious that the whole purpose of this is a middle-class tax cut to give people more take-home pay.\u201d He continued, \u201cAnd more to the point, we have to get faster economic growth, because with faster economic growth, you get bigger paychecks, you get bigger wage growth.\u201d He added that unlike with the plan to repeal and replace Obamacare, the House, Senate and White House have been working together on tax reform. \u201cWhat we did in the health care bill is that the House passed its bill, the President supported it, and the Senate kind of went in a different direction,\u201d he said. \u201cWhat we really labor to do this time on tax reform is get the three of us working all year long on this project. So since the beginning of the summer, you had the White House, the Senate and the House working together, hand in hand, every single week, to put together this tax framework.\u201d He also said that President Donald Trump\u2019s public input on legislation doesn\u2019t affect Congress\u2019 efforts. \u201c(Trump is) always throwing ideas in the pot,\u201d Ryan responded. \u201cThere is nothing wrong with that. There\u2019s nothing wrong with giving input and ideas. We do it quite a bit privately and sometimes he does it publicly.\u201d When asked whether his public remarks undercut the efforts, Ryan said no. \u201cNot at all. Not in the least,\u201d he responded. House Republicans unveiled key details and the text behind their tax legislation Thursday, but not without some reservations from rank-and-file members. \u201cThis is it. This is a very important and special moment for our country,\u201d Ryan said at a news conference before the interview with CNN. \u201cThis is our chance to make sure that generations to come don\u2019t just get by, they get ahead in this country.\u201d CNN\u2019s Deirdre Walsh contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Trump's tried and tested political defense mechanism is to whip up chaos It's clear Mueller is just getting started Donald Trump can\u2019t tweet his way out of this one. The President\u2019s tried and tested political defense mechanism is to whip up chaos to tip his enemies off balance and launch a fierce counter attack. He\u2019ll also take cover with his ultra-loyal political base, rely on Republicans who are too cowed to repudiate him and fog an issue with alternative facts. Like clockwork, Trump sought Tuesday morning to discredit the probe into Russia\u2019s meddling in the 2016 election and his campaign\u2019s potential role in it. \u201cThe Fake News is working overtime. As Paul Manaforts lawyer said, there was \u201cno collusion\u201d and events mentioned took place long before he came to the campaign. Few people knew the young, low level volunteer named George, who has already proven to be a liar. Check the DEMS!\u201d Trump said in a series of tweets. \u201cI hope people will start to focus on our Massive Tax Cuts for Business (jobs) and the Middle Class (in addition to Democrat corruption)!\u201d The Fake News is working overtime. As Paul Manaforts lawyer said, there was \"no collusion\" and events mentioned took place long before he... ....came to the campaign. Few people knew the young, low level volunteer named George, who has already proven to be a liar. Check the DEMS! I hope people will start to focus on our Massive Tax Cuts for Business (jobs) and the Middle Class (in addition to Democrat corruption)! But Robert Mueller\u2019s first big splash Monday suggested that Trump\u2019s methodology \u2013 which has helped him defy all the normal rules of electoral politics and the presidency \u2013 will face its sternest test yet with the relentless special counsel. As the events of a dramatic day unfolded, there was a sense that the White House was being forced to engage on Mueller\u2019s home turf rather than in the wild and whirling political environment where Trump feels most at home. Mueller\u2019s first indictments of former Trump campaign aides, the unveiling of a surprise guilty plea by a former campaign foreign policy adviser and the manner in which he set out his case suggest his probe is sweeping, strategic and steeped in detail. And it\u2019s clear he\u2019s just getting started. Why Robert Mueller is the most powerful man in Washington \u201cThe criminal justice interest being vindicated here is there\u2019s a large-scale ongoing investigation of which this case is a small part,\u201d said Aaron Zelinsky of the special counsel\u2019s office in a plea hearing for former campaign foreign policy adviser George Papadopoulos that was unsealed on Monday. In fact, Mueller\u2019s methodical performance suggests that Trump\u2019s orbit has much to fear from Mueller, a foe who is far more consequential than his folding GOP primary rivals, a tainted Hillary Clinton or the \u201cfake\u201d media \u2013 all of which have struggled to find answers to his unorthodox approach. Mueller\u2019s command of the Washington game and mechanics of the law, on show in his first salvo against the Trump team, also represent a test for Trump\u2019s instinctive mastery of disruption and diversion. \u201cThis was an impressive strategy that played out,\u201d Frank Figliuzzi, former assistant director of the FBI\u2019s counter intelligence division, told CNN. Figliuzzi said Mueller, by unveiling a sealed plea deal with Papadopoulos, was sending a message to other potential targets in the case that if they wanted to play hardball, he had people cooperating with him. Of course, if Trump has nothing to hide, then he has nothing to fear from Mueller, who has still yet to prove any clear evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia \u2013 the most explosive allegation facing those around the President. But faced with his resourceful new adversary, Trump\u2019s go-to mode of defense \u2013 a tweet in capital letters \u2013 seemed hardly adequate. \u201cThere is NO COLLUSION!\u201d the President wrote on Twitter. ....Also, there is NO COLLUSION! As it sought to find its balance, the White House was quick to seek out vulnerabilities in Mueller\u2019s initial gambit. But it was also immediately clear that its efforts, while serviceable in a political context, were much less suited to the constraining legal reality that is now facing Trump. \u201cToday\u2019s announcement has nothing to do with the President, has nothing to do with the President\u2019s campaign or campaign activity,\u201d White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said. People close to the White House, meanwhile, set about undermining the credibility of cooperating witness Papadopoulos, describing him as an overzealous low-level adviser who was a \u201czero\u201d in terms of campaign seniority. One White House official told CNN the President was bewildered by Papadopoulos being swept up in the case, apparently seeking to further diminish his role as a linchpin in Mueller\u2019s presentation. \u201cThe President is going, \u2018Really, this is the guy?\u2019\u201d the official said. But CNN legal analyst Laura Coates said that while such arguments may make sense politically, they are irrelevant to Mueller\u2019s mandate \u2013 to probe whether there was collusion between any Trump associate and Russia. \u201cThe directive was not a certain level official, a certain level of campaign person,\u201d said Coates. \u201cTo try to parse it in this way belies all logic to me legally.\u201d Even if the timeline of the charges against Manafort and Gates, related to their work for a formerly pro-Russian government in Ukraine, covers a period before they worked for Trump, the pair might pose a threat to the White House in other ways \u2013 a possibility that Sanders did not address. Given the gravity of the charges against them which carry long potential prison terms, and their treatment \u2013 both are now under house arrest \u2013 each man has a strong incentive to cooperate with Mueller\u2019s investigation. \u201cIf I was representing Paul Manafort, unless I was sure my client was getting a pardon, I would be talking to him about potentially cooperating with Mr. Mueller,\u201d said former federal prosecutor Renato Mariotti on CNN. In her briefing, Sanders also renewed the political charge that Clinton\u2019s campaign \u2013 and not Trump \u2013 was guilty of colluding with Russia, citing the infamous Fusion GPS dossier on the President\u2019s alleged past ties with Russia. But if the events and documentation made public Monday prove anything, it is that the political spin on which the White House has relied to dismiss the building storm over the Russia drama may not be enough to help Trump aides, and even the President himself, this time. From court filings and other documents, it is also clear that Mueller is operating on a broad canvas. Despite Trump\u2019s insistence last week that it is now \u201ccommonly accepted\u201d that there is no collusion involved, Monday\u2019s developments show that is a line that is being seriously pursued. By indicting Manafort and Gates on charges of tax evasion and money laundering, he is sending a signal he is willing to target wrongdoing in diverse forms. That may chill those around a President who has warned that he would see any attempt by Mueller to probe his family finances as an overreach. It was also another poor day Monday for Trump\u2019s increasingly thin claim that the Russia matter is nothing more than a \u201choax\u201d perpetrated by Democrats still sore about Clinton\u2019s 2016 election debacle. In documents outlining Papadopoulos\u2019 guilty plea, Mueller laid out what appear to be clear attempts by Russian intelligence to court the former foreign policy advisor, through someone identified as a \u201cprofessor,\u201d a Russian foreign ministry official \u2013 likely a cover for an intelligence officer, and a woman he believed to be President Vladimir Putin\u2019s niece. He also delivers a hint that he may not be done with Manafort \u2013 including evidence showing that Papadopoulos emailed the campaign manager with the news that Russia wanted to meet with Trump. He bolstered the case for collusion \u2013 in contradiction of the White House claim that there is nothing to answer for \u2013 by including an FBI statement saying that, as late as August 2016, a campaign superior told Papadopoulos to go ahead with a trip to Russia to meet officials. But the most daunting disclosure for the Trump camp may be the comment by attorney Aaron Zelinsky on Mueller\u2019s team that the Papadopoulos question was part of a \u201croad map\u201d of a much larger case. Faced with such challenges Trump has few options. Were he to try to dismiss Mueller, in a similar manner to the way he dispensed with FBI chief James Comey, he could incite a constitutional crisis. Trump\u2019s reflex to lash out in fact in the Comey case is the reason he is facing a special counsel probe in the first place. Should Trump pardon Manafort and Gates, he could close down the case but ignite a political firestorm. So he may have little option to sit and wait, and watch the special counsel weave his web.",

            "article_content": "Vote-a-rama is a typically annual ritual when senators can offer many amendments Many of the amendments are aimed at political messaging designed to inflict damage The Senate voted Thursday to pass a budget resolution for next year that is mostly significant because it could make it easier for Republicans to pass major tax cuts, a top GOP priority. The 51 to 49 vote was split mostly on party lines. Only GOP Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky voted no. To help speed tax reform, Republican leaders in the House and Senate worked with the White House to craft a technical amendment that would clear the way for the House to take up the Senate version and pass it as is, according to two GOP sources. That took a logistical hurdle out of the way, underscoring GOP desire to move forward on the tax overhaul as soon as possible. It would also mean the Republicans who control the Senate could pass a tax bill with 51 votes, not the 60 often needed for major bills. President Donald Trump hailed the budget\u2019s passage on Twitter Friday morning, saying it clears the way for \u201clarge scale Tax Cuts (and Reform), which will be the biggest in the history of our country!\u201d But before giving final approval, senators had to go through vote-a-rama, a typically annual ritual when senators can offer an endless number of amendments. That process could have stretched into the wee hours of Friday morning, although Democrats decided to limit their amendments curtailing the voting. As an expression of their unified frustration with the budget process and vote-a-rama, one of the last amendments voted on was to declare the vote-a-rama \u201cutter nonsense\u201d in the words of Republican Sen. David Perdue of Georgia and \u201cmeaningless and partisan\u201d in the words of Democratic Sen. Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island. They noted that the budget reconciliation process was designed to curb deficits but rarely works. The anti-vote-a-rama amendment passed on a resounding voice vote and then relieved laughter echoed through the chamber. Many of the amendments were aimed at political messaging designed to inflict damage on senators of the opposite party or to make other political points. For instance, progressive Sen. Bernie Sanders, a Vermont independent, offered an amendment \u201cto restore the trillion dollars in cuts to Medicaid paid for by reducing the Republican tax breaks for the wealthy.\u201d It was defeated by the Republicans, who control the Senate. He offered a second to prevent any tax cuts from going to the top one percent of earners. It was defeated too. Nevada Republican Sen. Dean Heller, one of the most endangered Republicans running for re-election, proposed an amendment \u201cto provide tax relief to American families with children to provide them with more money in their paychecks to make ends meet.\u201d Who could vote against that? No one. It passed 98-0. RELATED: The 10 Senate seats most likely to switch parties in 2018: October edition Other amendments were more technical but still pointed. Like one from Sen. Mark Warner, a Virginia Democrat, aimed at making sure Republicans abide by pay-as-you-go rules when they eventually pass tax reform, something Republicans don\u2019t intend to do, since their tax plan is expected to increase the deficit by $1.5 trillion. There were competing amendments from Democrats and Republicans over the contentious issue of allowing taxpayers to reduce state and local taxes from the federal returns. Democrats, who represent many higher-taxed states, wanted to preserve that deduction. Republicans, who represent many lower-taxed states, wanted to limit it. In this case the Democrats lost and the Republicans won. Either way, none of the amendments are binding because the budget resolution doesn\u2019t become law. These are the GOP sticking points on tax reform Before the voting began, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, urged senators to quickly pass the budget so they could move forward on tax reform. \u201cTax reform is all about getting America going again and growing again. It aims to take more money out of Washington\u2019s pockets and put more in middle-class pockets,\u201d McConnell said. \u201cAnd it represents a once-in-a-generation opportunity to replace a failing tax code that holds Americans back with one that works for them.\u201d Tax reform is also politically critical for Republicans especially after the failure of health care reform. They are under enormous pressure from Trump and GOP voters to get a big legislative win. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-New York, said his party planned to offer fewer amendments than in past years and focus on the emerging GOP tax overhaul, which they argue will give big tax breaks to the wealthy at the expense of the middle class. CNN poll: Most Americans oppose Trump's tax reform plan \u201cWe\u2019re going to also make our Republican colleagues vote on whether they want to raise taxes on the middle class,\u201d Schumer said. \u201cThe President claims his tax plan will cut taxes, but it actually will raise them on millions of hard working families. Today, our Republican colleagues will decide whether they want to support those tax increases, or protect the middle class from paying more taxes.\u201d One other item of note in the budget: It instructs the Energy and Natural Resources Committee to find $1 billion in deficit savings using the same reconciliation rules as the tax reform. And while those instructions don\u2019t mention ANWR specifically, easing the ban is a longtime goal of committee Chairman Lisa Murkowski, an Alaska Republican, and it is expected that she will pursue that policy and will be able to change it with just 51 votes. Democrats offered an amendment to strip it out but it was defeated on a 48-52.",

            "article_content": "Donald Trump is the first president in modern times to not release his tax returns His remarks made among a meeting with senators were met with 'nervous laughter' President Donald Trump quipped about his tax returns Wednesday while meeting with a bipartisan group of senators on tax reform, according to multiple sources. A source familiar with the meeting said that Trump flippantly made a comment along the lines of \u201c\u2018you might see my taxes one day\u2019\u201d or \u201c\u2019maybe I\u2019ll release them one day, who knows?\u2019\u201d Sen. Bill Cassidy, a Louisiana Republican, was in the meeting and confirmed the remark. \u201cHe just mentioned his tax returns. Everybody knows the controversies, everybody chuckled,\u201d Cassidy said, describing it as a nonchalant comment. \u201cSo I wouldn\u2019t take it too seriously,\u201d he added. Key Senate Republican: Bipartisan health care deal has 'stalled out' Trump is the first president in modern times to not release his tax returns. His financial dealings have come back into the spotlight since he\u2019s begun pushing for an overhaul to the tax code with a plan that he says would negatively affect wealthy people like him. \u201cI\u2019m doing the right thing, and it\u2019s not good for me,\u201d he said about the tax plan last month in a speech in Indiana. While Trump has reported hundreds of millions in income through financial disclosures, he has not made public his tax returns, which would show how much he pays in taxes and how the new plan would affect his tax bill. Another source briefed on the meeting confirmed Trump made the comment and said there was \u201cnervous laughter\u201d in the room. The meeting was held with members of the Senate finance committee, the main panel in the Senate tasked with passing tax reform legislation. Republicans released a \u201cframework\u201d of the tax plan last month that outlined the broad proposals of the plan but still lacked in detail. In the meeting, the President reiterated some of the key components of the plan, such as increasing the child tax credit, reducing the corporate rate from 35% to 20%, and eliminating the estate tax. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be a very big simplification,\u201d Trump said during a portion of the meeting that was open to the press. \u201cSo it\u2019s really tax cuts and reform, but I focus on tax cuts because it\u2019s such an important weapon to get our country really moving.\u201d Senate Republicans, who hold a 52-48 majority, are set to pass a bill this week that will allow them to pass tax reform with only 50 votes rather than the usual 60 needed to overcome a filibuster. Since Republicans can only afford to lose the support of two of their own, Trump has been actively trying to court Democrats. He met with Democratic members of the House ways and means committee last month and has been traveling to states that voted for him last year and have vulnerable Democratic senators up for re-election in 2018. Among the Democrats invited to the White House on Wednesday were Sen. Ron Wyden of Oregon (the top Democrat on the Senate finance committee), Sen. Sherrod Brown of Ohio, Sen. Bob Casey of Pennsylvania, Sen. Claire McCaskill of Missouri, Sen. Bill Nelson of Florida and Sen. Debbie Stabenow of Michigan. Brown\u2019s office said that he presented two bills to Trump that the senator believes would ignite a tone of a bipartisan spirit on tax reform. The first bill, the Working Families Tax Relief Act, increases the earned income tax credit and the child tax credit. The second bill, the Patriot Employers Tax Credit, would cut the corporate rate only for employers that keep jobs in the United States. Democrats have largely objected to the Republican tax plan so far, arguing that \u2013 contrary to what the President says \u2013 it\u2019s too beneficial to the wealthy compared to the middle class. Wyden said that he brought up in the meeting what he called a \u201cgrand canyon-sized gap\u201d between the rhetoric and the reality of the Trump tax plan. \u201cOne hand giveth, the other hand taketh away,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cYou double the standard deduction but you take away the personal and dependent exemptions.\u201d Multiple Democratic senators said they brought up concerns about the tax plan disproportionately benefiting the wealthy. Republicans, on the other hand, praised the meeting as productive. \u201cWe all agreed tax reform should focus on helping middle-class families, and that\u2019s what our plan does,\u201d Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, said in a statement. Sen. John Cornyn, the Senate majority whip, said on the Senate floor Wednesday that the President expressed a desire for tax reform to be done on a bipartisan basis. \u201cWhat we are going to do is come up with what we think represents the closest thing to a consensus of those who are interested actually in pro-growth tax reform, what that would look like, and then open it up to Democrats and Republicans alike to offer their amendments to change it,\u201d he said.

Exclusive: Clinton \u2018sick,\u2019 \u2018shocked\u2019 and \u2018appalled\u2019 by Weinstein allegations She said Putin had gotten some of what he wanted in President Donald Trump, but that Russia is not getting as much as it otherwise could out of the US, due to the nation\u2019s system of checks and balances. Clinton said she believed a grudge against her had motivated Putin, but that the Russian leader is also conducting a broader, ideological battle with the US. \u201cI think that Putin\u2019s campaign against us is much more about American democracy,\u201d Clinton said. She said Putin hoped to increase polarization in the US. \u201cHe wants an America that is divided from within,\u201d Clinton said. Russia has repeatedly denied that it attempted to meddle in the 2016 US election, and Trump has wavered on the US intelligence community\u2019s conclusions. In the interview recorded ahead of Trump\u2019s announcement on the Iran deal, Clinton criticized Trump for his expected decision to declare Iran not compliant with the deal and threaten to end it. \u201cI think it\u2019s very dangerous,\u201d Clinton said. Trump made such claims in remarks on Friday and pushed the issue to Congress. Clinton said the moves sent \u201cthe wrong message\u201d and undermined the credibility of the United States in the international community. \u201cIt basically says America\u2019s word is not good,\u201d Clinton said. Later in the interview, Clinton criticized Trump for the actions he has taken as President and the successful campaign he ran, which she said preyed on and stoked cultural anxiety in place of solutions that would help working people. She said it was up to Democrats to stand up for people and explain that the working class is being misled by Trump and the GOP. \u201cWe have to stand up for them,\u201d Clinton said. \u201cAnd we have to do a better job, number one, of explaining to people \u2018you are being snookered.\u2019\u201d Clinton pointed to public opinion polls showing relatively low approval ratings for the President as evidence the power of Trump\u2019s message was waning. \u201cHis numbers are shrinking,\u201d Clinton said, adding many of those still with him are his diehard supporters.",

            "article_content": "The history of the 2016 presidential election is still very much in its draft stage, but there is at least one line \u2013 from New York Sen. Chuck Schumer \u2013 that is sure to feature in the final accounting. During a live interview hours before Hillary Clinton accepted the Democratic presidential nomination in Philadelphia, he was asked if Donald Trump\u2019s blunt appeal to white working class voters could turn the Midwest red. Schumer, the unwavering optimist, offered allies this soothing equation: \u201cFor every blue-collar Democrat we will lose in western P-A, we will pick up two or three moderate Republicans in the suburbs of Philadelphia,\u201d he reasoned, \u201cand you can repeat that in Ohio and Illinois and Wisconsin. The voters who are most out there figuring out what to do are not the blue-collar Democrats. They are the college-educated Republicans, who lean Republican, or independent and in the suburbs.\u201d It is a remarkable riff, and not only for the sheer tonnage of faulty assumptions the now-minority leader manages to pack into such a tidy space. Schumer clearly possesses an abiding belief in the power of the political center \u2013 that there is no populist swell the establishment cannot divert, manage and make to find its level. This particular hubris is not his alone. In 2016, most Democrats (Republicans too), the Clinton campaign and the pundit class seemed to be working off a similar analysis. All but a few lonely observers missed out on the uprising that would deliver \u2013 if only just \u2013 Trump to the White House a few months later. How not to run for president (while probably running for president) Enter here former Vice President Joe Biden and the Republican Party\u2019s leading Trump-skeptic elected official, Ohio Gov. John Kasich. It was announced on Tuesday that the men will share a stage later this month at the University of Delaware, home to the Biden Institute, for a \u201cmoderated discussion\u201d on \u201chow to bridge the many political and partisan divides that exist in Washington, DC.\u201d This sounds nice enough in the abstract. Two grizzled political warriors, with more than six decades in Washington between them, coming together to amicably chew over ways to reroute gridlock. In yet another mark of their seriousness, both men have in the past few weeks and months taken shots at their own parties. Kasich this past weekend even told CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper he would be willing to leave the GOP if it continued its Trumpward drift. \u201cIf the party can\u2019t be fixed, Jake, then I\u2019m not going to be able to support the party \u2013 period,\u201d he said. \u201cThat\u2019s the end of it.\u201d Biden has never threatened to leave the Democrats, but he has been critical of both Clinton\u2019s 2016 campaign strategy \u2014 saying it neglected the concerns of lower-middle class and blue-collar voters \u2014 and the party\u2019s rabble-rousing, ascendant progressive populist wing. In a late September blog post on the Biden Institute website, the former vice president sought to drive his stake into the middle ground. \u201cI know some want to single out big corporations for all the blame,\u201d Biden wrote in an unsubtle jab at the rhetoric of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders. \u201cIt is true that the balance has shifted too much in favor of corporations and against workers. But consumers, workers, and leaders have the power to hold every corporation to a higher standard, not simply cast business as the enemy or let industry off the hook.\u201d He then pledged to set about identifying \u201cstrategies for economic growth that put work first.\u201d The effort would begin with a speech to CEOs in Washington, followed by a return to Delaware, where Biden planned to \u201clead a panel discussion with national leaders in business, labor, non-profits, and government.\u201d \u201cMy goal,\u201d he said, \u201cis to learn from their successes and find common ground to help leverage and scale them.\u201d Though Biden is obviously keen to set himself apart from Clinton, their ideology is almost identical \u2013 technocratic hearts in thrall to market wisdom. Both are dedicated to mapping out paths of least resistance, rather than running the risk of alienating entrenched interests by, in the Sanders vein, seeking to clear the way with a bulldozer. In this regard, Kasich and Biden, contra the implicit sales pitch, make for the most ordinary of bedfellows. Together, they proudly represent a receding brand of centrism their respective parties\u2019 rank-and-file regard with increasing or outright hostility. By its very existence, their effort to bridge the \u201cdivides that exist in Washington, DC, today\u201d doubles down on the conviction that, for all the upheaval in American culture and politics, voters are simply thirsting for a more decorous status quo. Joe Biden's not NOT running for president in 2020 What follows from there is simple, and familiar, because Clinton\u2019s campaign banked on it, too. It says \u2013 like Schumer did on that Thursday afternoon in July 2016 \u2013 that those same voters will cross party lines to back a responsible alternative to the irresponsible Trump. And that the promise of restoring the hallowed norms Trump now shreds for fun is a workable antidote to the tribalism that would make such quick partisan rearrangement improbable. (And even if the Goldilocks crowd did seek to reorder themselves, the political parties of today, locked in to a primary system that tends to reward the most devoted, are more beholden to their idealists and true believers than any band of centrists.) More than three years out from the next general election and with Trump not yet at the quarter pole of his term, predicting the proverbial \u201cmood of the electorate\u201d in the fall of 2020 is a fun, but futile parlor game. For now, the fundamental things apply: Trump\u2019s core support is firm and animated by its visceral rejection of a political class that prizes the norms and niceties being peddled by Biden and Kasich. So a bet on either, with Ohio governor re-cast as an independent or Democrat, or any centrist aspirant in their image, would suppose that millions of voters are plotting an abrupt U-turn \u2013 with no evidence to back it apart from a sniffing sense that progressives are ready to compromise on their dreams and the right would forswear power for better manners.",

            "article_content": "In an 11-hour period beginning at 7:19 a.m. and ending at 6:46 p.m. Saturday, the President of the United States ripped off 18 \u2013 yes, 18! \u2013 tweets dealing with the dire situation in Puerto Rico following the devastation wrought by Hurricane Maria. What\u2019s more remarkable than Donald Trump \u2013 aka the commander in chief, aka the most most powerful person in the country \u2013 tapping out 18 tweets on a single subject in less than 12 hours is the tone of those tweets: Negative, defensive and dark. It all began with Trump\u2019s slashing attack on San Juan Mayor Carmen Yul\u00edn Cruz, who has become the face of the humanitarian crisis in Puerto Rico \u2013 thanks in no small part to her interview Friday on CNN\u2019s \u201cNew Day\u201d in which she angrily denounced attempts by the Trump White House to present the situation in Puerto Rico as a \u201cgood news story.\u201d Trump, already worried about the perception that he and his administration have responded inadequately to the situation, responded to Yul\u00edn Cruz the only way he knows how: Viciously. \u201cThe Mayor of San Juan, who was very complimentary only a few days ago, has now been told by the Democrats that you must be nasty to Trump,\u201d Trump began just after 7 a.m. ET. \u201cSuch poor leadership ability by the Mayor of San Juan, and others in Puerto Rico, who are not able to get their workers to help,\u201d he added. \u201cThey want everything to be done for them when it should be a community effort. 10,000 Federal workers now on Island doing a fantastic job.\u201d At a time of crisis for more than 3 million Americans living in Puerto Rico, their President decided to pick a fight with a local official due to her frustration with the recovery efforts. Rather than send a tweet urging patience (or maybe not tweeting at all!), Trump decided the best course of action was to go after Yul\u00edn Cruz and \u201cothers in Puerto Rico\u201d for their allegedly poor job in dealing with Hurricane Maria. The words Trump used are telling. \u201cThey want everything to be done for them,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cThey\u201d? You mean the millions of American citizens in Puerto Rico? And the not-so-subtle suggestion of laziness in Trump\u2019s tweets is just more of the same racially coded language that the President has trafficked in since the day he announced his campaign. Had Trump sent only those three tweets hitting Yul\u00edn Cruz, it would have been a bad \u2013 but not atypical \u2013 day for him. But, he didn\u2019t stop there. Not even close. Trump spent the next eight(!) hours tweeting a series of attacks against the so-called \u201cfake news\u201d media for allegedly misrepresenting the actions of his administration in Puerto Rico. \u201cFake News CNN and NBC are going out of their way to disparage our great First Responders as a way to \u2018get Trump,\u2019\u201d he tweeted in one. \u201cNot fair to FR or effort!\u201d \u201cThe Fake News Networks are working overtime in Puerto Rico doing their best to take the spirit away from our soldiers and first R\u2019s. Shame!,\u201d went another. Trump provided no evidence for his claims. Or, really, explained what he meant by them. CNN, for its part, has provided significant coverage of the recovery efforts \u2013 highlighting both stories of inspiration and the real struggles of many on the island to cope with the lack of electricity and increasing shortages of water and food. A number of correspondents are on the ground in Puerto Rico \u2013 including Anderson Cooper and Bill Weir \u2013 documenting the situation firsthand. None of that comes even close to Trump\u2019s claim that the news networks are working to \u201cdisparage our great First Responders\u201d or that the media is \u201cdoing their best to take the spirit away from our soldiers.\u201d What Trump is doing \u2013 in his attacks on Yul\u00edn Cruz and the media \u2013 is trying to divide the country as a way to deflect blame for his administration\u2019s performance. \u201cThey\u201d are lazy and want everything done for them. \u201cThey\u201d are being nasty because Democrats told them to. \u201cThey\u201d aren\u2019t rooting for our first responders. \u201cThey\u201d are trying to convince people that our soldiers aren\u2019t doing a good job. Trump\u2019s willingness to divide, to turn every situation in which he is questioned or criticized into an \u201cus\u201d vs \u201cthem\u201d is well documented by now. The 2016 election was an 18-month master class in how to divide the country for your own political gain. Trump\u2019s handling of the white supremacist violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, and his deliberate decision to pick a fight with (mostly black) NFL players over the national anthem illustrate that same perpetual need to divide. That default divisiveness makes Trump different than every person who has held the office before him. For the 43 previous presidents, their ultimate goal was to find ways to remind people in the country of our common humanity, to take the high road, to appeal to our better angels. Many of them missed that mark \u2013 often badly \u2013 but it was always their North Star. It is not for Trump. Not close. For Trump, the lone goal is winning at all costs. If that means attacking the mayor of San Juan even as Puerto Rico faces a historic recovery challenge, so be it. If it means blaming Puerto Rico\u2019s debt and infrastructure issues even as people are desperately searching for their loved ones, well, that\u2019s just how it goes. If it means trying to build the media up as a scapegoat to cover up a slower-than-ideal response to Maria\u2019s aftermath? Consider it done! 18 tweets. 11 hours. Full of blame, anger and victimhood. Totally devoid of hope, inspiration or unity. This is Trumpism.",

            "article_content": "Donald Trump\u2019s self styling as the people\u2019s champion who would drain the Washington swamp got him to the White House. But now that unique brand is in for a stern test as the President is battered by controversies over wealthy cabinet members living high on the taxpayer dime and as he pushes a tax plan that Democrats are already billing as a massive giveaway to Trump\u2019s rich friends. Trump\u2019s transformation from a billionaire Manhattan real-estate magnate who jetted around in a private Boeing, into an advocate for the crushed dreams of middle class Americans in the globalized economy was one of the most audacious and successful aspects of his presidential campaign. His outsider screeds lambasting a Beltway establishment steeped in political corruption were a perfect fit for a time when many voters thought their politicians were getting fat on government salaries and Washington perks and getting nothing done. Republicans have big plans for taxes -- and Rep. Kevin Brady is in the middle of it all That\u2019s one reason why Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price is now in deep trouble, amid a storm over his use of taxpayer dollars to finance flights on corporate jets \u2013 even over short distances. CNN reported Wednesday that Environmental Protection Agency administrator Scott Pruitt also used private planes for government business. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has also been under fire for requesting the use of a government plane during his European honeymoon. Trump left Price twisting in the wind on Wednesday. \u201cI will tell you personally, I\u2019m not happy about it,\u201d Trump told reporters. \u201cI\u2019m going to look at it. I let him know it.\u201d Asked if he would fire Price, the President replied: \u201cWe\u2019ll see.\u201d EPA's Scott Pruitt also used private plane for government business Whether Price keeps his job in the end, Trump\u2019s comments were a clear sign that the President understands that the secretary\u2019s conduct, and that of several other members of the cabinet who took private jets, strikes at the heart of the drain the swamp narrative that he used to such effect last year. CNN Money: Details of GOP tax reform framework revealed And since Trump has made no attempt to broaden his support since taking office, the continued loyal support of his political base is an existential requirement for his presidency \u2013 one reason why he has stoked cultural and race controversies that resonate with his largely white, rural constituency, including his showdown with kneeling NFL players. But the shenanigans of cabinet members are not the only apparent contradiction with the roots of Trumpism that the President is going to have to square in the coming weeks. The tax reform plan that Trump unveiled in Indiana on Wednesday is already being attacked as a typical Republican approach, that critics say would hand huge benefits to the rich \u2013 i.e. people like the President himself. With that in mind, Trump took care to frame the plan in terms that recalled the populist rhetoric of his campaign and the \u201cAmerican carnage\u201d of shuttered factories and stolen jobs that he painted in his inaugural address. \u201cWe\u2019re going to cut taxes for the middle class \u2026 we are going to bring back the jobs and wealth that have left our country and most people thought left our country for good,\u201d Trump said. Ex-HHS secretaries: We flew mostly commercial \u201cIt\u2019s called a middle class miracle once again,\u201d he added. \u201cIt\u2019s also called a miracle for our great companies; a miracle for the middle class, for the working person.\u201d The political problem here though is that Trump\u2019s description of the plan, his best hope of enacting a meaningful legislative reform before the mid-term elections next year, does not tell the whole story. Trump sells tax plan as \u2018once-in-a-generation\u2019 opportunity The proposals do call for a doubling of the standard deduction to $24,000 for married couples and $12,000 for single filers. But the most sweeping overhaul of the tax system in generations also contains hefty giveaways for the wealthiest Americans, including in the abolition of the inheritance tax and proposes a cut in the corporate tax rate to 20%. Trump argues this will lead to an explosion of economic growth that will create millions of jobs, and bring back firms from low wage economies overseas, and make everyone better off in a new era of highly charged growth. But his approach has also offered a populist opening that Democrats will try to use in the months ahead to separate Trump from his electoral coalition, especially in the Midwest states that helped him secure victory last year. Puerto Ricans still waiting for aid a week after Maria's devastation \u201cThis is not tax reform - it\u2019s a thinly-veiled attempt to slash taxes for the wealthy while leaving the middle class, working families, and small business owners empty handed,\u201d said Democratic Rep. Joe Crowley of New York. \u201cThis framework would also cause our national debt to spike, resulting in Republican leaders cutting even more from critical programs that help American families, like Social Security, Medicare, and Medicaid, to offset the massive tax cuts they\u2019ve gifted to the rich,\u201d he added. Trump quickly tried to dispel the notion that he would personally benefit from his own changes to the tax system. \u201cIt\u2019s not good for me, believe me,\u201d Trump said. The President\u2019s refusal however to release his tax returns, breaking a tradition stretching back four decades, means that it is impossible to verify his claim. Democrats are certain to use that omission to try again to pressure the President to reveal how much tax he pays \u2013 though their efforts to damage him on the issue during the campaign foundered to their intense frustration. Last year, according to exit polls, Trump succeeded in convincing voters that he would take care of the middle class better than Hillary Clinton would. He narrowly won voters earning between $50,000 and $200,000 a year, who make up more than half of the total electorate. Attacks on the President\u2019s secrecy about his wealth looked promising for Democrats ahead of the general election campaign, but failed to disqualify Trump. The question now is whether the unshakable connection with the middle class voters in Trump\u2019s base will remain rock solid as takes steps to change America that affect the money in everyone\u2019s wallets and as Washington controversies suggest members of his cabinet are hypocrites. Nationalist trade adviser Peter Navarro sidelined, sparking concerns among Trump allies One reason why it might is that Trump\u2019s compact with his base voters is as much emotional, and tonal, as achieved by nitty gritty policy details that can be found in budgets and tax plans. No candidate in years had grasped or voiced the economic grievances of people who did not recognize the economic progress wrought after the Great Recession that Democrats touted during the campaign. While his Boeing had gold-plated seat belts, Trump was sometimes pictured sitting on it while munching a burger from a fast food chain while his earthy diction and politically incorrect stump speeches positioned him as a man of unsophisticated, and certainly not elite, tastes. Nationalist trade adviser Peter Navarro sidelined, sparking concerns among Trump allies At the same time, Trump\u2019s tirades against trade deals with nations like China played into a belief among many people that such pacts had hollowed out the American dream, while building middle classes lives for citizens of adversary nations. While some of his populist, nationalist advisers, like Steve Bannon, have now left his side, the President has been careful to highlight his suspicion of free trade pacts, ordering a renegotiation of NAFTA and a slamming a deal with US ally South Korea \u2013 even amidst a nuclear showdown with the North. That\u2019s all in the service of maintaining his connection to the voters that sent him to the Oval Office. Whether he can retain his populist image as President will go a long way to dictating the course of next year\u2019s mid-term elections \u2013 as Democrats try to win back voters in the decayed industrial heartlands. It will also be crucial in Trump\u2019s quest to revive his Midwest map to get to 270 electoral votes in 2020, his re-election year.",

            "article_content": "NEW: Sen. Orrin Hatch has slated hearings on how to fix the tax system next week The administration is seeking buy in from Democrats on tax reform legislation Three Democrats from states President Donald Trump won in 2016 will join the President on Tuesday evening for dinner as the White House seeks support for sweeping tax reform, congressional aides said. Multiple sources said the White House legislative operation viewed North Dakota Sen. Heidi Heitkamp, Indiana Sen. Joe Donnelly and West Virginia Joe Manchin \u2013 all moderate Democrats facing re-election in 2018 \u2013 as \u201cgettable\u201d Democrats on an otherwise partisan legislative push to slash taxes for corporations and overhaul the system. Three Republican senators were also due to attend the dinner Tuesday: Sen. Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania, Sen. Orrin Hatch of Utah and Sen. John Thune of South Dakota. The dinner comes as Trump\u2019s tax reform point men \u2013 Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin and National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn \u2013 headed to Capitol Hill to solidify the effort. The two had a Hill meeting on Tuesday as part of the so-called \u201cBig Six,\u201d a group that also includes four top GOP negotiators on Capitol Hill. Separately, two sources said Mnuchin and Cohn would meet with Republican members of the Senate budget committee. The latter meeting\u2019s purpose would be to try kick starting an effort to coalesce around the budget proposal for the coming fiscal year. Mnuchin and Cohn declined to comment as they walked out of the \u201cBix Six\u201d meeting. Hatch, the Senate finance committee chairman and a member of the tax group, told reporters \u201cwe\u2019ll have to see\u201d if the House and Senate would release one tax plan together or one for each chamber. \u201cWe\u2019re trying to put it together so both the House and the Senate can work together on it,\u201d Hatch said. \u201cHopefully we can work it out.\u201d Asked if it was necessary to give conservatives more details on what leadership is working on in order to assuage their concerns, Hatch demurred, saying, \u201cThat\u2019s up to the leadership.\u201d Hatch announced later Tuesday afternoon he planned to convene a hearing next Tuesday on ways changes to the tax code could improve the situation for business. Establishing a budget proposal would overcome a key hurdle for tax reform, which Republicans must find a way to pay for in order to pass through the Senate with a simple majority vote. Under the rules of the Senate, Republicans can pass tax reform with a simple majority vote only if the plan would not increase the nation\u2019s deficit outside of the 10-year budget window. The top negotiators \u2013 who along with Cohn and Mnuchin include House Speaker Paul Ryan, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, Hatch and House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady \u2013 have been hammering through the details and disputes of the forthcoming proposal for months. Those meetings have ticked up in frequency and have started to branch out to include outreach to the members of the key tax writing committees as leaders attempt to get their members comfortable with the coming effort. Brady is scheduled to brief the House GOP conference Wednesday on the status of the negotiations. It is a crucial component of the process, aides say, with leaders cognizant of the perception that members were left out of the process of drafting the Republican plan to repeal and replace Obamacare, dooming it to eventual failure. Still, aides in both chambers acknowledge the path forward is more difficult than not given the constant tug of special interests, state and district priorities and ideological baselines. White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said at the press briefing Tuesday afternoon that guests for the White House dinner were chosen \u201cby their willingness to want to sit down and have these conversations with the President.\u201d Asked about the potential for including Montana Sen. Jon Tester, another red state Democrat up for re-eleciton in 2018, in tax talks, Sanders said, \u201cWe want to sit down with anybody who is willing to be serious about real tax reform for this country, about providing real relief for middle class America, and actually looking to make bold changes.\u201d \u201cThose are the conversations we want to have,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cAnd I would imagine if Senator Tester wants to be involved in those and is serious about it, we\u2019d certainly be willing to have that conversation with him.\u201d Mnuchin acknowledged the difficulty of passing the massive tax cuts Trump called for without ballooning the deficit. He said at an event hosted by CNBC that they might not be able to get the corporate tax rate down to 15% \u201cgiven the budget issues.\u201d But even with an increasingly stacked legislative calendar going into the end of the year, Mnuchin maintained his position that the Republicans would pass tax reform by the end of the year. Mnuchin\u2019s outreach to the Senate on Tuesday would come after his muddled attempt last week to mollify outraged House conservatives over a deal Trump brokered with Democratic leaders to tie three-month extensions of government spending and the debt ceiling to hurricane relief funds. Trump delivered a speech in Heitkamp\u2019s homestate of North Dakota earlier in September, bringing the Democratic senator along with him on Air Force One and calling her a \u201cgood woman.\u201d Aides say future visits in states that are home to Democratic senators where Trump won handily in 2016 will come in the weeks ahead.

            "article_content": "Sanders campaigned relentlessly against the Republican bills, mostly in the Midwest and Rust Belt. Public opinion polls have begun to show more support among Democrats for single-payer. First, consider this: It\u2019s the summer of 2019 and a dozen Democratic presidential candidates are gathered onstage for a debate somewhere in the Midwest. The network moderator concludes her introductions and tees up the opening question. \u201cWho here tonight supports moving the United States toward a single-payer, or \u2018Medicare for all,\u2019 taxpayer-funded health care system?\u201d Pause it there and rewind to January 2016 in Iowa. The caucuses are days away, and Hillary Clinton is fending off an unexpected challenge from Sen. Bernie Sanders. The discussion turns to single-payer, and Clinton balks. \u201cPeople who have health emergencies can\u2019t wait for us to have a theoretical debate about some better idea that will never, ever come to pass,\u201d she tells voters in Des Moines, explaining her campaign\u2019s focus on preserving and expanding Obamacare, while dismissing the progressive insurgent\u2019s more ambitious pitch. Go back even further now to the last contested Democratic primary before that, in 2008, and recall the lone and lonely voices in favor of single-payer care. They belonged to Ohio Rep. Dennis Kucinich and former Alaska Sen. Mike Gravel. The pair combined for a delegate haul of precisely nil. Back to the present \u2013 a decade on \u2013 and after a chaotic months-long push by Republicans to dismantle former President Barack Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act, the prospect of Sanders\u2019 \u201cMedicare-for-all\u201d program has emerged as the hot-button centerpiece of the Democratic Party\u2019s roiling public policy debate. After a summer that has seen so many of the party\u2019s most ambitious officials and brightest prospects line up in vocal support of what was so recently a fringe cause, consider again how the single-payer question will be received on a Democratic debate stage. Here\u2019s a hint: Expect to see a lot of hands. Still, for a party on its heels in Washington and around the country, the 2020 race is a distant star. If Democrats fail to claw back enough seats in next year\u2019s midterm elections, the health care conversation will remain in its current state: purely hypothetical. But as Sanders prepares to unveil his new legislation next week, the broader left is beginning to coalesce around a vision that holds up universal, government-backed health care as a core Democratic party principle. The Vermont independent\u2019s forthcoming bill \u2013 its arrival delayed on at least three occasions by Washington\u2019s unique rancor \u2013 has Senate cosponsors in Kamala Harris, Kirstin Gillibrand, Elizabeth Warren, Sheldon Whitehouse, Cory Booker, Jeff Merkley, and Tammy Baldwin. More Democrats could join before its unveiling on Wednesday. The House companion bill, from Michigan Rep. John Conyers, has 117 cosponsors, a little more than 60% of the entire caucus. About half of those cosponsors signed on after House Republicans introduced their first hack at Obamacare repeal, the American Health Care Act. For the better part of five months, Democrats in both chambers, along with a coalition of liberal protesters, fought to wrest defections from the GOP line. Ultimately, it was a single vote in the Senate \u2013 delivered well after midnight on a Friday morning in late July \u2013 that signaled an improbable rearguard victory. But even before Arizona Republican Sen. John McCain angled his thumb toward the floor, the effort to unwind Obama\u2019s signature legislative feat was beginning to backfire on the GOP. Sanders set the tone early on. About a week after House Speaker Paul Ryan unveiled the AHCA in March, he tweeted a warning. \u201cNever lose sight of the fact that our ultimate goal is not just playing defense,\u201d Sanders wrote. \u201cOur goal is a Medicare-for-all, single payer system.\u201d Never lose sight of the fact that our ultimate goal is not just playing defense. Our goal is a Medicare-for-all, single payer system. Sanders campaigned relentlessly against the Republican bills, mostly in the Midwest and Rust Belt. His criticism was lacerating. In June he told a Saturday night crowd in Pittsburgh that if the GOP plan\u2019s implementation would be \u201ca moral outrage that this nation will never live down.\u201d After rolling into Ohio overnight, he rose in Columbus the next day as part of a joint barnstorming effort with organizers from MoveOn.org to brand the Republican proposal \u201cthe most anti-working-class legislation ever passed in the modern history of our country.\u201d Not 24 hours later, Sanders\u2019 Democratic colleagues began amassing on the steps of the Capitol in Washington; their conversation, kicked off by Booker and Georgia Rep. John Lewis, who broadcast it a Facebook Live, went viral. Hawaii Sen. Brian Schatz, now considering a bill of his own that would allow anyone to buy-in to Medicaid, and Gillibrand joined in early on. \u201cHealth care should be a right, it should never be a privilege,\u201d Gillibrand said, almost in passing. \u201cWe should have Medicare-for-all in this country.\u201d One viral moment had given way to another, and Gillibrand\u2019s office confirmed to CNN the next day that, \u201cYes,\u201d she supports single-payer. A few weeks on, in mid-July, Sanders returned to Des Moines, Iowa, for the first time since the 2016 election to water the grassroots. \u201cOur immediate test,\u201d he said, was to defeat the Republican plan. \u201cBut as soon as we accomplish that, I will be introducing legislation which has gained more and more support all across this country, legislation for a Medicare for All, single-payer system.\u201d Robert Becker, Sanders\u2019 2016 Iowa campaign director, was in the hall that day. (As was top Trump adviser Kellyanne Conway, as it happened, for an unrelated event just a few hundred feet away.) Between cigarettes, and before his old boss arrived on the scene, Becker sat back and diagnosed the bubbling dynamic. \u201cEvery time Paul Ryan, or someone who is trying to dismantle the Affordable Care Act, steps to the podium and starts talking about insurance rates and premiums getting higher and higher and higher, they\u2019re actually making an argument for a single-payer system,\u201d he said. \u201cYou don\u2019t hear people on Medicare and Medicaid complaining about their co-pays.\u201d There were other tailwinds kicking up. Public opinion polls had begun to show hardening support among Democrats for single-payer. One notable Pew survey released in mid-June found more than half of Democrats supported such a program. Among liberals, the number jumped to 64%. Looking across party lines, the poll found that a third of Americans backed the policy, up 12 points from 2014. When it was reported Friday that Obamacare architect and former Montana Sen. Max Baucus, hardly a progressive firebrand, now supported single-payer, saying, \u201cWe\u2019re getting there, it\u2019s going to happen\u201d \u2013 there were some chuckles on the left, but little surprise. When it became apparent on July 17 that Senate Republicans did not have the votes to advance their own bill, the Better Care Reconciliation Act, progressive political organizations pounced. Working Families Party national director Dan Cantor, after warning presciently that \u201cthis may well not be the last version of Trumpcare we see,\u201d all but thanked Republicans for joining the battle. \u201cIn the end, the biggest impact of the Republicans\u2019 attack on healthcare may be this: It has strengthened the resolve of many, many Americans to fight for healthcare for all,\u201d he said. Adam Green, the Progressive Change Campaign Committee co-founder, brushed off the prospect of \u201csmall-bore technocratic tweaks,\u201d saying it was time to offer \u201cevery American access to Medicare.\u201d After a subsequent, last-ditch Republican push to secure enough votes for \u201cskinny repeal\u201d failed, Democrats on Capitol Hill began a swift public relations counteroffensive. Their weakened status in Congress has, on this front, turned out to be a sort of gift, offering freedom to test drive a variety of ideas and, should they crash, walk away relatively unharmed. On August 3, Michigan Sen. Debbie Stabenow launched the \u201cMedicare at 55 Act,\u201d a limited buy-in program. Seven Democratic colleagues attached themselves immediately, and by the end of the month, Harris, whose progressive bona fides have been called into question by activists, became the first senator to go further and formally back the Sanders plan. \u201cHere, I\u2019ll break some news: I intend to co-sponsor the Medicare-for-all bill, because it\u2019s just the right thing to do,\u201d she said a town hall in Oakland, California, shortly after informing Sanders of her intentions. \u201cThis is about understanding, again, that health care should be a right, not a privilege. And it\u2019s also about being smart.\u201d This past Thursday, Warren announced her decision in an email to supporters. \u201cI believe it\u2019s time to take a step back and ask: what is the best way to deliver high quality, low cost health care to all Americans?,\u201d she wrote. \u201cEverything should be on the table \u2013 and that\u2019s why I\u2019m co-sponsoring Bernie Sanders\u2019 Medicare for All bill that will be introduced later this month.\u201d By the evening, another Senate Democrat, Connecticut\u2019s Chris Murphy was making headlines of his own. According to a Politico report, Murphy is currently drafting a bill of his own that would put Medicare on the Obamacare exchanges and allow individuals and businesses an option to buy in. The growing crop of bridge bills, though they might disappoint hardliners, is another leading indicator of where the party is headed. But if the Stabenow and Murphy plans would appeal to some Democrats in part for their abilities to shield less bullish colleagues from pressure on the left, they represent only a temporary solution given the enthusiasm of activists for a universal program. As former Sanders campaign digital organizing director Claire Sandberg said in an email after the Harris announcement, activists are charged up \u2013 and the pressure will be unyielding. \u201cThe grassroots movement for universal health care will have to push Democratic leaders to not just voice support for Medicare-for-all when the party is in the minority,\u201d she said, \u201cbut also demand that Democrats commit to keep fighting and refuse to back down or water down the proposal when the party is back in power.\u201d CNN\u2019s Eric Bradner contributed to this report",

            "article_content": "At times, the nearly 500-page book reads like Clinton's burn book of zingers Clinton does take some responsibility for her stunning 2016 loss Hillary Clinton latest memoir, in the eyes of the former secretary of state and those around her, is meant to be a reflection on the 2016 election and serve as an examination of Donald Trump\u2019s stunning win. At times, though, the nearly 500-page book entitled \u201cWhat Happened\u201d reads like Clinton\u2019s burn book of zingers, where page after page oozes with her contempt for Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, fired FBI Director James Comey, Russian President Vladimir Putin and a host of other political figures. Clinton's really not running again -- and her book is proof Clinton does take some responsibility for her stunning 2016 loss, admitting that she didn\u2019t see the defeat coming, misunderstood the electorate and underestimated Trump from the outset. She also notes how there are times she looks back at the campaign and wishes she reacted more vigorously than she ultimately did, despite her staff and advisers urging restraint. But the former secretary of state lays plenty of blame at the feet of outside influences, including Comey\u2019s persistent investigation into her email practices and the Russia\u2019s meddling, to explain the loss. James Comey Of all the 2016 figures in Clinton\u2019s book, most of the blame for her loss is heaped on the fired FBI director. Clinton\u2019s most damning accusation against Comey \u2013 whom she labels the \u201crash FBI director\u201d \u2013 is that she would have won the election before he informed members of Congress that he was reopening the investigation into her emails on October 28. \u201cIf not for those decisions, everything would have been different,\u201d she said. \u201cComey himself later said that he was mildly nauseous at the idea that he influences the outcome of the election. Hearing that made me sick.\u201d Comey turned the entire election \u201cupside down\u201d in late October. A list of things Hillary Clinton says she did wrong in 2016 \u201cNow voters were worried my presidency would be dogged by more investigations, maybe even impeachment,\u201d she concluded. Clinton also regrets how she handled Comey\u2019s July 5 news conference where the former FBI director said she had been \u201cextremely careless\u201d in handling her email. That comment, Clinton writes, was \u201ccompletely unexpected and inappropriate.\u201d \u201cMy first instinct was that my campaign should hit back hard and explain to the public that Comey had badly overstepped his bounds \u2013 the same argument Rod Rosenstein would make months after the election. That might have blunted the political damage and made Comey think twice before breaking protocol again a few months later,\u201d Clinton writes. \u201cIn the end, we decided it would be better to just let it go and try to move on. Looking back, that was a mistake.\u201d Vladimir Putin For Clinton, there is no one more deserving of American derision than the Russian President, who she charges with undermining her campaign to elect Trump. Putin, Clinton writes, had a \u201cpersonal vendetta against me and deep resentment toward the United States,\u201d which led him to launch \u201ca massive covert attack against our own democracy, right under our noses.\u201d Woven in her memoir is Hillary Clinton's ode to Bill Clinton says Putin \u201cdoesn\u2019t respect women and despises anyone who stands up to him, so I\u2019m a double problem.\u201d Clinton writes that Trump was \u201cthe perfect Trojan Horse for Putin\u201d and, as she has in the past, writes that Russia\u2019s involvement in the 2016 election is more serious than the Watergate scandal. And all of this continues to consume Clinton, who writes that she thinks about Trump\u2019s accusation about not being a puppet \u201cevery time\u201d she sees the President on TV. \u201cNo puppet. No puppet. You\u2019re the puppet,\u201d Trump said during a debate. \u201cThis man is President of the United States,\u201d Clinton writes. \u201cAnd no one is happier than Vladimir Putin.\u201d Julian Assange Clinton\u2019s view of Assange, the founder of WikiLeaks, is that he is a charlatan front for the Russian government. She calls him \u201codious\u201d and a \u201chypocrite\u201d for saying he is a \u201cchampion for transparency, but for many years, he\u2019s been helpful to Putin, one of the most repressive and least transparent autocrats in the world.\u201d Clinton writes that it was \u201cmaddening\u201d that Putin and Assange were working together to undercut her 2016 campaign. \u201cOf course I had to face not just one America-bashing misogynist but three,\u201d she writes. \u201cOf course I\u2019d have to get by Putin and Assange as well.\u201d Joe Biden Clinton generally heaps praise on Biden, but his comments during a March appearance at the University of Pennsylvania angered her, she writes. \u201cJoe Biden said the Democratic Party in 2016 \u2018did not talk about what it always stood for \u2013 and that was how to maintain a burgeoning middle class,\u2019 \u201d Clinton writes. \u201cI find this fairly remarkable, considering that Joe himself campaigned for me all over the Midwest and talked plenty about the middle class.\u201d Clinton rejects the idea that she didn\u2019t speak enough about the economy, but does say in the book that her campaign had struggled staying on message, a knock that she somewhat pins on the media. Barack Obama Clinton showers former President Barack Obama with praise throughout the book, but during a lengthy section on Russia, the former secretary of state openly questions what would have happened if Obama had more forcefully called out Russia for their 2016 election meddling. The comment, which pales in comparison to Clinton\u2019s other attacks in the book, is as close as Clinton comes to attacking her former boss. \u201cI do wonder sometimes about what would have happened if President Obama had made a televised address to the nation in the fall of 2016 warning that our democracy was under attack,\u201d she writes. \u201cMaybe more Americans would have woken up to the threat in time. We\u2019ll never know.\u201d Clinton also subtly knocks Obama for his suggestion that she lay off directly criticizing Sanders, her Democratic primary opponent whom she largely ignored in early 2015. \u201cMy team kept reminding me that we didn\u2019t want to alienate Bernie\u2019s supporters. President Obama urged me to grit my teeth and lay off Bernie as much as I could,\u201d Clinton writes. \u201cI felt like I was in a straightjacket.\u201d Bernie Sanders Clinton\u2019s book is chock full of scorn for Sanders, her 2016 rival and Vermont senator. Clinton does praise Sanders \u2013 saying he \u201cdeserves credit for understanding the political power of big, bold ideas\u201d and for inspiring \u201cmillions of American, especially young people.\u201d But the kind words are largely overshadowed by her enmity. She knocks Sanders for his stance on guns. \u201cBernie Sanders, who loved to talk about how \u2018true progressives\u2019 never bow to political realities or powerful interests, had long bowed to the political reality of his rural state of Vermont and supported the NRA\u2019s key priorities, including voting against the Brady Bill five times in the 1990s,\u201d she writes. And the attacks he leveled against her, saying they lay the groundwork for Trump. \u201c(Sanders\u2019) presence in the race meant that I had less space and credibility to run the kind of feisty progressive campaign that had helped me win Ohio and Pennsylvania in 2008,\u201d she writes. \u201cBecause we agreed on so much, Bernie couldn\u2019t make an argument against me in this area on policy, so he had to resort to innuendo and impugning my character,\u201d she adds. Jill Stein Stein \u201cwouldn\u2019t be worth mentioning\u201d in other scenarios, Clinton says, but the Green Party candidate who attacked the former secretary of state throughout the campaign contributed to her loss, Clinton writes. \u201cSo in each state, there were more than enough Stein voters to swing the result, just like Ralph Nader did in Florida and New Hampshire in 2000,\u201d Clinton writes. Apathetic women Days after Trump\u2019s inauguration, hundreds of thousands of women and men marched in cities across the country during what came to be known as the Women\u2019s March. Clinton did not attend, writing that she decided to decline invitations because \u201cit was important for new voices to take the state, especially on that day.\u201d And while Clinton writes that the protests helped her overcome the shock of Trump becoming president \u2013 \u201cIf the inauguration on Friday was the worst of times, Saturday turned out to be the best of times\u201d \u2013 she does admit the day was \u201cbittersweet.\u201d \u201cI couldn\u2019t help but ask where those feelings of solidarity, outrage and passion had been during the election,\u201d Clinton writes. Clinton adds that at least two dozen women \u2013 mostly those in their 20s \u2013 have approached her since the election to apologize for not voting. Clinton says she has responded with \u201cforced smiles and tight nods\u201d and retells a story of a mother forcing her daughter to apologize to Clinton for not voting. \u201cI wanted to stare right in her eyes and say, \u2018You didn\u2019t vote? How could you not vote? You abdicated your responsibility as a citizen at the worst possible time! And now you want me to make you feel better,\u2019 \u201d Clinton writes. \u201cOf course, I didn\u2019t say any of that.\u201d \u201cThese people were looking for absolution that I just couldn\u2019t give. We all have to live with the consequences of our decisions,\u201d she writes. Liberal activists Clinton was pestered throughout the campaign by Black Lives Matter protesters, who questioned her commitment to their cause and decisions the Clinton administration made during the 1990s. One of the most vocal challenges from Black Lives Matters came during an event Clinton hosted in New Hampshire, where protesters tried to get into the event to disrupt it but settled on meeting with Clinton afterward. Clinton writes that while she \u201cunderstood the frustration of the Black Lives Matter activists\u201d and \u201crespected their conviction,\u201d she worried that activists were \u201cmore interested in disruption and confrontation than in working together to change policies that perpetuate systemic racism.\u201d Mitch McConnell Clinton charges the Senate majority leader with \u201cactively playing defense for Trump and the Russians.\u201d \u201cWe know now that even after he was fully briefed by the CIA, McConnell rejected the intelligence and warned the Obama administration that if it made any attempt to inform the public, he would attack it for playing politics,\u201d Clinton writes. \u201cI can\u2019t think of a more shameful example of a national leader so blatantly putting partisanship over national security.\u201d She adds: \u201cMcConnell knew better, but he did it anyway.\u201d Jason Chaffetz Chaffetz, a former congressman from Utah, was a thorn in Clinton\u2019s side throughout the election, promising to continue investigating Clinton despite the fact the FBI had closed their inquiry. Clinton recalls meeting Chaffetz at the inauguration, expect writes that she thought she was meeting Reince Priebus, Trump\u2019s chief of staff. \u201cLater I realized it hadn\u2019t been Priebus at all. It was Jason Chaffetz, the then-Utah congressman and wannabe Javert who made endless political hay out of my emails and the 2012 tragedy in Benghazi, Libya,\u201d Clinton writes, a reference to the antagonist in Victor Hugo\u2019s 1862 novel Les Miserables who becomes obsessed with pursuing Jean Valjean, the book\u2019s protagonist. After the encounter, Chaffetz posted a photo of his handshake with Clinton, but added this dig: \u201cThe investigation continues.\u201d \u201cWhat a class act,\u201d Clinton recalls. \u201cI came this close to tweeting back, \u2018To be honest, thought you were Reince.\u2019 \u201c Ryan Zinke Clinton recalls how she met then-Rep. Ryan Zinke, future Trump administration interior secretary, during the traditional lunch following inauguration. Zinke, Clinton recalls, brought his wife over to say \u201chello.\u201d \u201cThis was somewhat surprising, considering that in 2014 he called me the \u2018Antichrist,\u2019 \u201d Clinton writes, adding that when she met him she confronted by saying, \u2018You know, congressman, I\u2019m not actually the Antichrist.\u2019 \u201c \u201cHe was taken aback and mumbled something about not having meant it,\u201d Clinton writes. \u201cOne thing I have learned over the years is how easy it is for some people to say horrible things about me when I\u2019m not around but how hard it is for them to look me in the eye and say it to my face.\u201d This story has been updated.",

            "article_content": "It\u2019s one week until Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 memoir \u201cWhat Happened\u201d is officially released. But, in an excerpt that made the rounds today, Clinton writes critically about her 2016 primary opponent Bernie Sanders. Clinton makes the case that Sanders damaged her chances of winning with his pie-in-the-sky proposals that pleased liberals but could never actually become law. So, is she right? CNN\u2019s Greg Krieg and I spent the afternoon exchanging emails about that very question. Our conversation \u2013 edited only lightly for flow \u2013 is below. Cillizza: All right, Greg, We\u2019re getting bits and pieces of Hillary Clinton\u2019s book about the 2016 election as we get closer to it hitting bookstores (are they even a thing anymore?) next week. The new nugget features Clinton running down Bernie Sanders for his primary challenge in 2016. The part I cared about was where Clinton compares Sanders to a one-upper. That no matter what she proposed, he would propose something even more appealing to the party\u2019s liberal base \u2013 entirely without any consequence. Recollects Clinton: \u201cWe would promise a bold infrastructure investment plan or an ambitious new apprenticeship program for young people, and then Bernie would announce basically the same thing, but bigger. On issue after issue, it was like he kept promising four-minute abs, or even no-minutes abs. Magic abs!\u201d To my mind, she\u2019s not wrong! Clinton was forced to be mindful of how the positions staked out in a primary would impact her in a general election.  Sanders, who no one \u2013 including him! \u2013 thought could or would win, had no such constraint. He could propose whatever he wanted in a largely consequence-free environment while she lived in an all-consequences, all-the-time environment. Sanders was running a cause. Clinton was running a campaign. Tell me how I\u2019m wrong. Krieg: Let me start by saying, the timing of this book is truly remarkable. I know these things are set way in advance and wouldn\u2019t be shocked if Clinton herself \u2013 despite all the frustrations we\u2019ve read about in just these few pages \u2013 might wish this debate, both ours and the one now blazing on Twitter, could be put off a bit. Or not! Anyway, I\u2019m struck right off the bat by how little nuance there is in Clinton\u2019s assessment. For such a smart, savvy and accomplished person, she comes off as weirdly blinkered. These paragraphs are pretty narrowly composed and make no real account for why Sanders was so popular. Perhaps it\u2019s comforting to dismiss his popularity and, implicitly, the desires/frustrations of his supporters, as being rooted in the desire for free ponies or \u201cmagic abs.\u201d But that really undersells the issue at the heart of this. Sanders was, of course, coming at this campaign from a very different angle. By his and his aides\u2019 own admission, they were surprised at how quickly a movement-based candidacy turned into an electorally viable one. But even then, he was pitching a fundamentally different view of politics. Now, you can dismiss that as unreasonable or unlikely to happen, but it\u2019s a losing strategy, in broad terms, to quit the conversation there. Did America want a pony? Perhaps. Though I\u2019d say Americans were and are frustrated by their debt and economic inequality and medical bills, etc. Essentially saying that their desire for relief was wishful (and frankly, silly) puts a pretty fine point on her shortcomings a candidate. Cillizza: Look. I love a free pony as much as the next guy, but you make a fair point. I think one of Clinton\u2019s biggest problems in the race was that she never understood that Sanders\u2019 appeal wasn\u2019t totally about his proposals \u2013 which weren\u2019t radically different than hers \u2013 it was about his tone and willingness to confront Republicans at all times and on all fronts. Her political background was forged in the 1980s and 1990s \u2013 when bipartisanship was something to be aimed at. That wasn\u2019t the mindset of the Democratic Party, whose nomination Clinton was seeking. They wanted confrontation. They viewed the GOP worldview as not just wrong but immoral. They didn\u2019t want carefully poll-tested policies designed to barely keep them on board while also peeling off moderate Republicans. Sanders intuitively understood that because he has made charging at GOP-constructed windmills his life\u2019s work.  All the way to the end, Clinton never grasped what Democrats really wanted from her. I think the tendency to dismiss Sanders in the book is representative of the fact that she still doesn\u2019t get that reality. ALL of that said: I still think running a campaign against a candidate running a cause is really, really hard. I would be fascinated by what would have happened if, after his New Hampshire victory, Sanders had been able to score a few more wins in big important states over that next six weeks. It might have changed the perception of the race \u2013 and forced Sanders and the Democratic Party to come face-to-face with the real possibility that he might be the nominee. Krieg: Last things first. I agree entirely \u2013 with you and Clinton \u2013 that Sanders did not have as fully developed of a policy portfolio. During the debates and in some interviews during his early 2016 surge, his lack of clearly defined foreign policy ideas sometimes made plain his shortcomings. As it happens, part of the reason he didn\u2019t win much in those post-New Hampshire weeks was that he didn\u2019t have the infrastructure or the time to develop a compelling enough message to win down South. (And even with more time, winning there was certainly no guarantee.) I also agree that, on balance, Sanders\u2019 proposals weren\u2019t too far from Clinton\u2019s. The debate over higher ed is a great example. Clinton wanted debt-free college. Sanders went a bit further, suggesting a tuition-free approach. They eventually hashed out a compromise plan. This is why so many progressives, in the days before the election, were confident of having a seat at the table in a Clinton administration. But again, the fundamental issue here \u2013 as you note \u2013 is that Clinton didn\u2019t then, nor does she now, seem to accept the legitimacy of the Sanders wing\u2019s underlying argument. Which is, (overly) simply stated, that the country has \u2013 over the last 30 or 40 years and with the Democratic Party\u2019s acquiescence \u2013 been moving away from public control of public goods. For example: Those \u201cmarket-based solutions\u201d that seem to do more for the market than those looking for solutions. This was always tough and clearly annoying to Clinton. She\u2019s been in the arena; Sanders was a mayor in Vermont, then a back-bencher in Congress. But \u2013 and look to the UK and Jeremy Corbyn for further evidence here \u2013 that is not enough of an argument for many voters. In fact, lots of Sanders supporters will tell you that his unwillingness to play ball and make compromises they view as having damaged the working class is not a bug, but a feature piece of his appeal. Here\u2019s a question: Where are you on the \u201chis attacks caused lasting damage\u201d argument? A lot of Sanders people will say that, if anything, he pulled punches. Cillizza: Absolutely not! I agree with Sanders\u2019 people who say he pulled punches. He refused to ever talk about her email server which was, literally, a hanging curveball that he could smash out of the park. And, on her speech-giving to massive corporations \u2013 including Goldman Sachs \u2013 Sanders went WAY easier than he could have if he wanted to portray Clinton as a corporate shill. Hillary Clinton lost because she was never the \u201cheart\u201d candidate of the activist base, because she never grasped what the email server really meant to people (that the Clintons think the rules don\u2019t apply, that the Clintons think they are deserve different treatment), because of James Comey announcing the re-opening of the email investigation, because of WikiLeaks/Russia and mostly because she was the status quo candidate in a change election. But, she definitely didn\u2019t lose because of Bernie Sanders. One last thing that this conversation has got me to wondering about: Is there going to be a candidate from the \u201cClinton wing\u201d of the Democratic party in 2020? Joe Biden? Can he qualify? He never loved or ascribed to Clinton\u2019s sort of politics \u2013 and is much more willing to speak out than she ever was. But, if it\u2019s not Biden, then who is that candidate? Krieg: One other thing on the Clinton-Sanders dynamic before I get to the (fun) 2020 stuff. Clinton here notes \u2013 correctly! \u2013 that she had better fleshed-out policy positions. But I think what frustrated people on the left, and certainly some of her most ardent supporters, is that she did not always center them during her campaign. These things are visceral, and always have been, so when you reply to some questions with, \u201cGo look on my website,\u201d that\u2019s going to frustrate people. Ironically, what was on Clinton\u2019s website would have appealed \u2013 tweak here, tweak there \u2013 to a whole lot of Sanders supporters. Obviously there was an element within his support that, on a personality level (heightened in some cases by very real sexism), was never going to give her a look. But there were others, I think, who had/have room in their hearts for both Bernie and Hillary! (In fact, I\u2019d say that\u2019s the majority of Democrats.) As for 2020\u2026 oy. A few months ago I\u2019d have said this primary is 100% going to boil down to a Clinton winger vs. a Berniecrat. Though I think some people will see it that way no matter what, as we go forward, I\u2019m thinking the Democratic Party is going to square this stuff away before then. Maybe not in terms of its larger message, but as it relates to a national candidate. (See Kamala Harris, and surely others, co-sponsoring Sanders\u2019 single-payer test bill. Or Elizabeth Warren, who basically everyone in the party and on its left could rally behind right now.) So, could it be Biden? I doubt it. People who tout him, I think, believe that Clinton\u2019s loss was mostly about personality and that Ol\u2019 Joe could run on about the same policy and win over the working class voters she lost. My bet is that a group of younger candidates with fewer attachments to the \u201980s and \u201890s will emerge. One caveat: Sanders himself. If he runs, which I personally don\u2019t think he will do, it upends all of the above. The 2016 scars come right back out. And maybe Biden does get drawn back in.",

            "article_content": "Ben Gibbard wrote his first political song to protest Donald Trump \"Million Dollar Loan\" was released as part of the \"30 Day 30 Songs\" project Thirty musicians from around the nation have joined forces to release thirty songs protesting Donald Trump \u2014 one on each day of the last month before the November 8 election. The \u201c30 Days, 30 Songs\u201d project was launched by author Dave Eggers and so far, includes songs like \u201cMillion Dollar Loan\u201d by Death Cab for Cutie, \u201cWith Love From Russia\u201d by Bhi Bhiman, \u201cSame Old Lie\u201d by Jim James and \u201cDemagogue\u201d by Franz Ferdinand. \u201cI firmly believe that Donald Trump is the most offensive and dangerous presidential candidate we\u2019ve ever had, certainly in the 20th century,\u201d Death Cab for Cutie frontman Ben Gibbard told CNN in a phone interview last week. \u201cI am not supporting a candidate in as much as I\u2019m voting against Donald Trump,\u201d he added. Ahead of the interview, Gibbard had just heard that Trump criticized the appearance of one of the women who are accusing the Republican presidential nominee of sexual assault. Donald Trump on accuser: \u2018Take a look at her \u2026 I don\u2019t think so\u2019 \u201cUnbelievable, absolutely unbelievable,\u201d Gibbard said, before launching into a tirade against Trump and explaining why for the first time throughout his music career, he has chosen to get political. The Seattle native, who was also the frontman of the Postal Service, has been making music for decades, but \u201cMillion Dollar Loan\u201d is the first political song he has ever recorded. The song was inspired by Trump\u2019s story that he got his start in business in Brooklyn with a \u201csmall loan of a million dollars,\u201d given to him by his father. Gibbard said that while \u201cthere\u2019s almost too much material,\u201d for protest songs against Trump, that particular moment especially \u201cenraged\u201d him. \u201cThe fact that he would choose to share that story in an attempt to relate to Americans and specially to working class Americans, I found so egregious,\u201d Gibbard said, \u201cto refer to a sum of money that most people will never see in their lifetime as \u2018small,\u2019 to use this as a feeble attempt to relate and prop yourself up as some sort of self-made billionaire \u2014 absolutely outrageous.\u201d A message left with Trump\u2019s campaign for comment was not returned. Gibbard said that he has \u201cempathy\u201d for Trump supporters and can relate to their dissatisfaction with Washington, but slammed what he calls \u201cthe racist, mysoginistic and xenophobic rhetoirc that has come out of (Trump\u2019s) mouth and by proxy, the mouth of his supporters.\u201d The musician was a supporter of Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders during the primary, who also rallied against the establishment, but Gibbard said that he Sanders\u2019 platforms were too \u201cidealistic\u201d to become reality in today\u2019s political climate. Check out: #GetPolitical \u2014 A CNN Politics originial series \u201cI appreciate (Sanders) bringing all of these issues to the table,\u201d Gibbard said, but added that he was unable to \u201clatch on completely to his campaign\u201d in the same way he is unable to passionately rally behind Clinton. \u201cI\u2019m voting for Hillary Clinton, there\u2019s no doubt about that,\u201d Gibbard said, \u201cBut I\u2019m disappointed in the choices we were given.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Hillary Clinton has featured in a number of hip-hop tracks She might try to capitalize on the hip-hop community to turn out young voters In her starring role in Robin Thicke\u2019s newest single \u201cBack Together,\u201d rapper Nicki Minaj name drops Hillary Clinton: \u201cUsed to call me Hillary cause I ride \u2018em,\u201d which is a play off of Hillary Clinton\u2019s maiden name, \u201cRodham.\u201d The video for \u201cBack Together\u201d was released Thursday and while tweeting about the release, Minaj highlighted the Clinton lyric. A fan on Instagram noted that they have seen this play on words in reference to Clinton done before: \u201cThat\u2019s so lame Lil Wayne did that line so long ago,\u201d one commented, referencing Lil Wayne\u2019s 2008 hit \u201cLollipop.\u201d @NICKIMINAJ yessss \ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffb\ud83d\udc4f\ud83c\udffb this verse is up there with some of your best, it's amazing While another fan tweeted, \u201cthis verse is up there with some of your best, it\u2019s amazing.\u201d For hip-hop fans, a Clinton reference is not news because the former First Lady has been mentioned in rap lyrics for decades. The Democratic frontrunner would tie Ronald Reagan for oldest president on Inauguration Day if elected and a hip-hop boost might be just what she needs when it comes to connected with a diverse group of young voters. Clinton has began racking up a slew of endorsements from rappers and hip-hop artists since 2012 and the Clinton campaign is not letting them go unnoticed. About a month after she announced her presidential bid, \u201cTonight Show\u201d host Jimmy Fallon, noted Clinton\u2019s growing number of hip-hop endorsements and said \u201cThank you Hillary Clinton for getting endorsed for president by several rappers,\u201d nicknaming her \u201cGhostface Hillah,\u201d after the Wu-Tan Clan\u2019s Ghostface Killah. Clinton responded with a Tweet: \u201cThanks, @jimmyfallon\u2014but we actually prefer this,\u201d posting the logo \u201cRUN HRC\u201d in red, white and blue, which is a play off of the logo of the classic 80s-90s hip hop group RUN\u2014D.M.C. Thanks, @jimmyfallon\u2014but we actually prefer this. http://t.co/WAlkyO08Uy pic.twitter.com/T1Dwl4si7q The Clinton campaign also boasted about an endorsement from Queen Bey, herself, by not-so-subtly pointing out that Clinton has Beyonc\u00e9\u2019s support. Yep. Beyonc\u00e9. Get the best #Hillary2016 moments delivered to your inbox\u2014sign up for The Feed: http://t.co/VOv5boBkoo pic.twitter.com/xA7aN8h88x And on the night of the first Republican debate, Clinton posted a selfie with rapper and hip-hop mogul Kanye West and his reality star wife Kim Kardashian, with the caption \u201cnew friends.\u201d A post shared by Hillary Clinton (@hillaryclinton) \u201cA celebrity endorsement is not going to persuade you to vote for a person but a celebrity endorsement will make it so that it\u2019s cool to tell people you\u2019re voting for somebody,\u201d Sam Popkin, a political science professor who specializes in voter behavior, told CNN.\u201dThey make it cool to be for Hillary Clinton and not something to keep to yourself.\u201d While older Americans who have followed Clinton for decades might have already made up their minds about her, many millennials are still getting to know her \u2014 some for the first time. And they are the ones whose impressions of Clinton can be more effectively shaped by these endorsements, Popkin says. \u201cThe Beyonc\u00e9 endorsement is a big deal\u201d because it enables Clinton to build \u201ca real identity\u201d in the world of Beyonc\u00e9 and Jay-Z,\u201d he argued. \u201cThat\u2019s what Clinton never did in 2008.\u201d During the 2008 election, as hip-hop artists backed Obama, Atlanta rapper and actor Ludacris caught heat for his lyrics slamming Clinton: \u201cHillary hated on you, so that b\u2014- is irrelevant.\u201d The song was called \u201cPolitics: Obama is Here,\u201d and it drew condemnation from the Obama campaign. At a 2008 Jefferson Jackson dinner before the Iowa caucuses, for instance, Clinton showed up with the legendary producer, musician and philanthropist Quincy Jones. Meanwhile, Obama showed up with Grammy award-winning R&B star John Legend, who has a younger following. This time around, Clinton has already connected herself to Legend by including his hit \u201cWake Up Everybody,\u201d featuring The Roots, Common and Melanie Fiona, in her campaign\u2019s official 2016 Spotify playlist. While these pop culture attempts to connect with young voters can garner attention for the campaign, she has work to do where it comes to young and engaged political activists. Clinton and her fellow Democratic candidates have left the civil rights activists associated with the #BlackLivesMatter movement generally unimpressed and unsatisfied. The campaign recently kept protesters out of a Clinton event, arguing it was at capacity. Clinton later met with protesters for 15 minutes. Related: Clinton meets with protesters barred from her event In a post titled \u201cWhy Hillary Clinton\u2019s \u2018RUN HRC\u2019 isn\u2019t okay\u201d in \u201cBlavity: The Voice of Black Millennials,\u201d Victoria Massie writes: \u201cWe are not just swagger to be exchanged \u2026 If Clinton wants to begin sincerely courting us for more than celebrity support, she must be willing to love us and our issues as much as she loves our musical legacies. She cannot bank on us having her back if she does not have ours.\u201d In the past few months Clinton has invoked \u201cblack lives matter\u201d at campaign events, called for police body cameras, called out GOP candidates on voting rights and rolled out a plan to make college more affordable. Democratic strategist Jamal Simmons, who served as an adviser to P Diddy during the rappers\u2019 2004 Vote or Die campaign, said that while Clinton\u2019s hip-hop endorsements could \u201cgenerate interest and enthusiasm\u201d for her run, whether people like her policies will be what drives voters to the polls. Some of the positive references to Clinton are ones in which she is tied to her husband, who was largely popular in many black communities in the 1990s. Following Bill Clinton\u2019s 1998 impeachment, novelist Toni Morrison wrote that Clinton was mistreated because of his \u201cBlackness,\u201d reflecting the strong connection that the former President shared with African Americans. Morrison famously referred to Clinton as America\u2019s \u201cfirst black president.\u201d The phrase was adopted by some Clinton supporters but was also considered offensive by others. \u201cClinton displays almost every trope of blackness: single-parent household, born poor, working-class, saxophone-playing, McDonald\u2019s-and-junk-food-loving boy from Arkansas,\u201d Morrison wrote. But during the 2008 primary when black Americans literally had the chance to elect America\u2019s first black president, a record number of black voters threw their support behind Obama. And whether this key component of the Obama coalition will go to bat for Clinton at the polls this time around is yet to be seen. The reference to Bill and Hillary Clinton\u2019s relationship in Thicke and Minaj\u2019s \u201cBack Together\u201d is part of a larger trend. While Clinton\u2019s popularity throughout her career has fluctuated, positive references to the Clintons as a unit continued in lyrics, even after her primary fight against Obama. In Yo Gotti\u2019s 2012 track \u201cWe Can Get it On,\u201d, the Memphis rapper links the Clintons to celebrity couples, largely celebrated and admired in the black community: \u201cWe like Tiny and Tip, maybe Puffy and Kim, Michelle and Obama, maybe Jada and Will we like Hova and B, maybe Hillary, Bill, we can be who eva we wanna shawty long as we real,\u201d referencing rapper T.I and Tiny, P. Diddy and Kim Porter, the Obamas, Will Smith and Jada Pinkett-Smith and of course, Beyonce and Jay-Z. References like that are common. Even after endorsing Obama in 2008 Ludacris made a reference to Clinton in \u201cLet\u2019s Stay Together,\u201d a track that also links the couple to the Smiths: \u201cLet\u2019s stay together \u2026 If Will and Jada can do it, then why can\u2019t we? Hillary is still with Bill Clinton, how did they do it?\u201d And in Juvenile\u2019s 2009 track \u201cMake U Feel Alright\u201d featuring Kango Slim, the Clintons are yet again linked to the Smiths: \u201cGot\u2019chu feelin me the way that Jada feelin Will and Hillary feelin Bill.\u201d As Clinton dove into her own political career, artists also rap about her status as a powerful woman. And she is often referred to as \u201cHillary Rodham,\u201d without the \u201cClinton,\u201d in tracks like Nelly\u2019s \u201cGrillz,\u201d Lil Wayne\u2019s \u201cLollipop\u201d and Jay Z\u2019s \u201cNymp.\u201d In Young Jeezy\u2019s \u201cWhite Girl,\u201d the Atlanta rapper who endorsed Clinton for president in 2016, raps \u201cHilary Clinton, she my best friend (Tell \u2018Em)/ Even co-signed for that new white Benz.\u201d And in the remixed version of Kendrick Lamar\u2019s \u201cB\u2014- Don\u2019t Kill My Vibe,\u201d Jay-Z famously raps: \u201cSittin\u2019 next to Hillary smelling like dank, presidential pardon,\u201d stirring speculation about whether the rapper was high at the White House. Meanwhile some hip-hop artists like The Game expressed skepticism. In \u201cLetter to the King,\u201d featuring iconic rapper Nas, the Los Angeles rapper questions her dedication to the black community: \u201cIf Dr. King marched today would Bill Gates march? I know Obama would but would Hillary take part?\u201d And in Ice Cube\u2019s \u201cStand Tall,\u201d the former member of N.W.A. raps: \u201cNever put your trust in Hillary Rodham, cause I can tell you now it\u2019s gon\u2019 turn out rotten.\u201d READ: Will black voters give Hillary Clinton a second chance? Popkin says that most people don\u2019t vote for a candidate merely because of what celebrities say, but how Clinton is viewed by legends of the culture will draw attention to her and that is the value of her hip-hop boost. For a candidate who lost both the youth vote and the African American vote in the \u201908 primary, failing to connect with and energize these two key constituencies of the Obama coalition, could prove to be detrimental at the polls.

            "article_content": "Kid Rock teased a US Senate run on Twitter two weeks ago He performed at the Republican National Convention in 2016 About two weeks after teasing a potential bid for US Senate, musician Kid Rock announced early Thursday morning that he is creating a non-profit to promote voter registration. \u201cThe one thing I\u2019ve seen over and over is that although people are unhappy with the government, too few are even registered to vote or do anything about it. We have over a year left until an actual election, so my first order of business is to get people engaged and registered to vote while continuing to put out my ideas on ways to help working class people in Michigan and America,\u201d a statement on his website said. Kid Rock tweets tease US Senate run in Michigan He also said he\u2019d hold a news conference in the next six weeks to address the non-profit and a potential Senate run. \u201cIf I decide to throw my hat in the ring for US Senate, believe me\u2026 it\u2019s game on,\u201d the statement says. Kid Rock, a supporter of President Donald Trump, performed at the 2016 Republican National Convention in Cleveland. He visited the White House with Sarah Palin and Ted Nugent in April. He initially tweeted interest in jumping into politics on July 12 after teasing a new website. \u201cI have had a ton of emails and texts asking me if this website is real\u2026 http://kidrockforsenate.com The answer is an absolute YES,\u201d he tweeted Wednesday afternoon. The website Kid Rock referred to in his tweet features a photo of the musician \u2013 sporting a hat, aviator sunglasses and a leather jacket \u2013 next to a stuffed moose, sitting on a blue chair (decorated with stars). The website logo reads \u201cKid Rock \u201918 For US Senate.\u201d Page visitors can also purchase swag, including stickers, shirts, lawn signs and caps that read \u201cKid Rock for US Senate.\u201d The link to purchase apparel redirects visitors to Warner Bros. Records website.

            "article_content": "Progressives are greeting leadership's economic agenda with cautious optimism Democrats hope they can juice the base while activating a growing populist grassroots The plan is out and the verdict is in. Progressives are greeting the Democratic congressional leadership\u2019s new economic agenda with cautious optimism, choosing to highlight notes of common cause \u2013 and mostly play down the now familiar divisions \u2013 as the party begins a fresh play to rebrand itself ahead of the coming midterm election. There is little in the policy portfolio introduced on Monday in Virginia that will strike voters as new or innovative \u2013 a close reading of the Hillary Clinton campaign\u2019s voluminous issues hub will turn up many of the same ideas and policy prescriptions. If anything, Clinton ultimately went further then than the new pitch did in its debut now, with pages dedicated to organized labor and debt-free college. But the question for national Democrats in this chaotic moment is less about policy \u2013 an ongoing debate that both invigorates and threatens to rupture the party \u2013 than prioritization in messaging. A dirty word in some quarters, Democrats are now banking on the hope that, by zeroing in on chronic economic dislocation, they can juice the liberal base while activating a growing populist grassroots that rejected Trumpism but never quite came around to the alternative. The challenge now, will be in convincing the public to buy in. \u201cYou have to be extremely disciplined,\u201d Rebecca Katz, a progressive Democratic strategist and former top aide to former Nevada Sen. Harry Reid, told CNN. \u201cIt\u2019s not about the one day of unveiling a message. It\u2019s about sticking to it every single day and having all of your members and all of your candidates saying the same thing, over and over and over again.\u201d Progressive criticism of the Clinton campaign\u2019s tactics often returns to this point. Policy is easily subsumed by politics \u2013 and success, be it in elections or the daily struggle to commandeer the conversation, comes to those who can streamline the two and then hammer away. \u201cWhat we\u2019ve learned from the last election is that it\u2019s not enough to have a good issues page on your website,\u201d Katz said. \u201cYou need to actually talk about it and fight for it everyday.\u201d How they go about it \u2013 in particular language they use \u2013 will be instrumental. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer\u2019s introduction in the The New York Times and the official agenda are colored by the language of the left. Pledges to invest \u201cdirectly\u201d \u2013 that is, with public funds \u2013 in new infrastructure projects and \u201ccrack down on monopolies and the concentration of economic power\u201d project a renewed willingness to tout government intervention as a worthy means of advancing working class interests. \u201cDemocrats have too often hesitated from taking on those misguided (pro-business) policies directly and unflinchingly \u2013 so much so that many Americans don\u2019t know what we stand for,\u201d Schumer wrote. \u201cNot after today. Democrats will show the country that we\u2019re the party on the side of working people.\u201d There is early buy-in from the progressive left, which has welcomed the shift in focus. As the Progressive Change Campaign Committee\u2019s Adam Green said in an email to reporters, \u201cThe framing of this 2018 economic populist messaging is admirable and strong.\u201d Berniecrats\u2019 leaders too are praising the party\u2019s direction \u2013 offering mostly good reviews to the Democratic plan while playing down its tensions with the bolder agenda presented by the new \u201cPeople\u2019s Platform,\u201d which pushes for single-payer health care and free college. We're in front of the DNC with @ninaturner, @OurRevolution and other partners of #SummerForProgress to demand a #PeoplesPlatform. pic.twitter.com/80pEONDmrx \u201cOur Revolution will be asking Democrats to use the \u2018Better Deal\u2019 as a starting point and to not only support the Democratic platform but to discuss these issues at every opportunity,\u201d the group\u2019s board chair, Larry Cohen, told CNN on Tuesday, hours before its new president, Nina Turner, and other activist groups launched their \u201cSummer for Progress\u201d in Washington, DC. The progressive millennial group #AllOfUs, which helped craft the \u201cPeople\u2019s Platform,\u201d responded to the rollout on Monday with an email headlined, \u201cImitation may be the greatest form of flattery.\u201d A day on, co-founder Waleed Shahid said the new agenda \u201creveals where progressive populists have won over the establishment and where we haven\u2019t.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s clear that (Democrats) realize they must message as populists,\u201d Shahid said, \u201cbut they aren\u2019t fully willing to break with Wall Street and their corporate donors, force the billionaire class to pay their fair share, and embrace \u2018Medicare For All,\u2019 free college, a full employment economy based in transforming our energy system, or taking the Republican dog whistle head on.\u201d Those negotiations are coming. Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders is expected to release his single-payer health care plan soon after the fate of Trumpcare is decided. Republican success in repealing Obamacare, suddenly on the table again amid a flurry of late reversals by GOP senators, would only boost its relevance. In the meantime, Democrats are committed to keeping it simple. \u201c(A Better Deal) is our collective vision,\u201d House members Cheri Bustos, David Cicilline and Hakeem Jeffries wrote in a Monday op-ed on CNN.com. \u201cThis is not a slogan. It\u2019s who we are and what we intend to accomplish for the American people.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Sen. Bernie Sanders talks health care during Iowa visit He speaks at gathering of progressives The last time Sen. Bernie Sanders was in Iowa, there was an election to win. It was November 2016 and Sanders was barnstorming Hawkeye State college towns, trying in vain to drum up support for Hillary Clinton. He returned on Saturday under slightly different circumstances. President Donald Trump is finishing his sixth month in office and Senate Republicans are hammering away at an Obamacare overhaul that could cause more than 20 million people to lose insurance over the next 10 years. The campaign continues, but this time around it turns on health care \u2013 beating back the Senate GOP bill while building up support for the single-payer plan Sanders will likely introduce in August. Making the first of two scheduled summer visits here, the state that will play host to the first-in-the-nation caucuses of a still far-off presidential campaign season, Sanders kept up his broadsides against the Republican health care overhaul, calling it the most \u201canti-working class legislation in the history of the country.\u201d He named and tried to shame both of his Senate colleagues from Iowa, pleading with the Republicans repeatedly to reject the bill. \u201cI say to Sen. Grassley and Sen. Ernst, please, please take a hard look at what this disastrous legislation will do to the people of Iowa and the people of America,\u201d the Vermont senator said. \u201cI beg of them: please vote \u2018no\u2019 on this legislation.\u201d Had he arrived on the scene in Des Moines an hour or so earlier, Sanders might have been able to deliver the message personally to White House counselor Kellyanne Conway, who by some cosmic coincidence happened to be in town \u2013 just an escalator ride away \u2013 in the same building, speaking at the Family Leadership Summit, a gathering hosted by conservative evangelical activist Bob Vander Plaats. Or perhaps Sanders will have the chance in a few years. His appearance, downstairs, at this annual convention sponsored by the progressive Citizens for Community Improvement, has juiced up speculation over his 2020 plans. Typically loathe to discuss the prospect, he did allow in an interview with liberal radio host Mark Thompson this week that he was \u201cnot taking (the possibility of a run) off the table, I just have not made any decisions.\u201d If Sanders does take a second shot, he would join the contest as an early favorite, a popular national figure equipped with the infrastructure he lacked in 2015 and 2016, both organizationally and in the form of elected officials eager to make a show of their common cause. Cathy Glasson, a nurse and union leader, was among the Sanders-loyal candidates making the rounds at the downtown Iowa Events Center. She is one of a hearty field of Democrats vying for the party\u2019s gubernatorial nomination in 2018, a race made suddenly more appealing with the departure of Republican Gov. Terry Branstad, who left office to become the Trump administration\u2019s ambassador to China. \u201cWe want to change the dynamic in 2018,\u201d Glasson said, arguing that victory for Iowa progressives \u2013 like her \u2014 in the midterm season could \u201cset the frame for presidential candidates when they start coming through. It\u2019s the very start of something fantastic that can happen right here in our own state to drive a national agenda as well.\u201d But organizers here are almost reflexively averse to overindulgence in presidential chatter. It\u2019s not a parry. Republicans\u2019 inability to move on policy in Washington, while their GOP colleagues in state houses build heavy majorities and rack up legislative wins, hasn\u2019t gone unnoticed. Nor has the utility \u2013 as evidenced in the fight to turn back Trump policy \u2013 of controlling high-profile statewide offices. \u201cIt\u2019s extremely premature for anybody to talk about 2020, because we need to take things back in 2018,\u201d Robert Becker, who ran Sanders operation in Iowa last year, said as attendees filled workshops on Medicare-for-all and climate action. \u201cIt\u2019s not a campaign that ended, it\u2019s beginning and evolving. The energy is up and down (the ballot).\u201d As has become commonplace, especially as Capitol Hill holds Obamacare in the balance, Sanders\u2019 one-two on health care \u2013 a defense of the Affordable Care Act, for which he has traveled the country rallying support, then a push to \u201cMedicare for all,\u201d the single-payer system that is growing in popularity on the left \u2013 drew roaring ovations in Des Moines. \u201cWhat\u2019s important about \u2018Medicare for all\u2019 specifically is that he\u2019s saying you can beat something with nothing,\u201d said Michael Lighty, the public policy director for National Nurses United. \u201cAnd the ACA simply isn\u2019t popular enough to take a purely defensive stand and expect victory.\u201d No matter how the Senate vote breaks down, Sanders will be taking his proposal public in the coming weeks. While the bill is politically unfeasible in the current Congress, the plan among supporters is to brand the policy as a Democratic Party staple. For activists with their sights set high, simply making the pitch represents a chance to keep close with the grassroots. \u201cHe is going to areas where the Democrats have done badly since 2010,\u201d Lighty said, rattling off the states and regions \u2013 western Pennsylvania, Ohio, West Virginia, Kentucky \u2013 Sanders has visited over the last month. \u201cSo this is not just about health care.\u201d",

In an interview with CNN\u2019s Don Lemon Wednesday, Rep. Tim Ryan criticized his party\u2019s brand, their outreach to voters and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi. \u201cThe brand is just bad,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cI don\u2019t think people in the beltway are realizing just how toxic the Democratic Party brand is in so many parts of the country.\u201d Republicans still love Nancy Pelosi Lemon asked Ryan if he believed Pelosi was more toxic than Donald Trump. \u201cThe honest answer is in some areas of the country \u2013 yes, she is,\u201d Ryan said. \u201d I think that in certain areas, like in some of these special election districts, it doesn\u2019t benefit our candidates to be tied to her. \u201c Ryan challenged Pelosi last fall for the top leadership position, but lost that internal election, receiving only 63 votes from the 194 members. \u201cClearly, we\u2019re coming off an election, and she\u2019s been getting pounded now for 10 years with negative ads from the Republicans.\u201d Ryan added, \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s fair. But, clearly, these ads using her, linking her to our candidates is still working.\u201d Gergen: Special election victories show Trump could beat Dems in 2020 The Ohio lawmaker argued that the Democratic Party had lost touch with the working class. \u201cI worry sometimes that we get so obsessed and angered by Donald Trump, which is OK, but you can\u2019t hold on to it because it takes your eye off the ball,\u201d Ryan said. \u201cWe\u2019re not focusing on the economic messages.

            "article_content": "After eight years of riding President Barack Obama the brain trust is unable to drive the party Democrats do not have, either by omission or commission, a cohesive economic message The newly activated Democratic base \u2013 the resistance! \u2013 was tripping over itself for a fight. Their money arrived down South by the truckload. The Republican President\u2019s approval ratings are in the tank. And yet, another Election Day is gone, and Democrats are again asking where it all went wrong. By late Tuesday night, the answers were rolling in. Prominently mixed into this dog\u2019s breakfast of recriminations, mostly from the party\u2019s activist left, there is at least one recurring thread: Democrats do not have, either by omission or commission, a cohesive economic message. Operatives and consultants peddle tactics, electoral \u201cpaths\u201d to power, but after eight years of riding President Barack Obama, mistaking his talents for their own, the brain trust is unable to drive the party. Jon Ossoff's full election concession speech Still, as it relates to Georgia\u2019s 6th Congressional District, a number of caveats apply. Jon Ossoff, the 30-year-old former congressional staffer and documentary filmmaker, entered the race facing long odds. No Democrat had won the seat in his lifetime. Hillary Clinton came close to nicking the vote there from Donald Trump last November, but fell short. Tom Price, whose departure to join the Trump administration set off the months-long contest, won re-election a little more than six months ago by more than 20 points. Ossoff, despite losing, ate substantially into that margin. Progressives do not contest this point. No one \u2013 at least that I\u2019ve spoken to in the past 12 hours \u2013 suggested that the race was a forsaken gimme. Bouncing the GOP from this affluent Atlanta suburb was always going to require a good, late break. But while Karen Handel\u2019s victory predictably sent Democrats back to their respective corners, prior assumptions confirmed, it has not, of yet, precipitated more than a few notes of discord from the party establishment. And for the left flank of activists, that\u2019s a problem. For now and going forward into 2018 and beyond. Democrats just went 0-4. When will they win? Most of the more prominent progressive objections look back further than the beginning of this race. Ossoff\u2019s particular strategic failures or flawed messaging were panned, but the most convincing criticism has been trained on the institutional aimlessness that guided him. This analysis by some progressives questions the fundamental assumption that Georgia\u2019s sixth was a national bellwether, instead presenting it as a lagging indicator of Democratic rot. Not that Ossoff isn\u2019t catching his share of the blame. He ran, as much as anything else, as a Democratic cipher and seemed, in interviews and public appearances, to be physically straining himself to avoid any contentious comments. Disinclined to define himself, Handel and the Republicans wisely lashed him to a muddling party. (Hence the resurgence of House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi, more than seven years\u2019 removed from the speakership, as the chosen bogeyman. She at least represents something.) \u201cUntil we take a risk as a party in offering a bold economic platform, we\u2019re not going to break through in some of these elections,\u201d California Rep. Ro Khanna said on the phone late Tuesday night. \u201cWhen you try to target things to a lowest common denominator, you run the risk of not having an inspiring message.\u201d Other critics, many less preternaturally diplomatic than Khanna, were unsparing. Democracy for America Chair Jim Dean unburdened himself in a press release delivered soon after Ossoff\u2019s loss was confirmed. But like the congressman, Dean zeroed in on the failures of the party\u2019s high level strategists. \u201cDefeating Republicans in districts that they have traditionally held requires doing something drastically different than establishment Democrats have done before,\u201d he said, listing among those priorities \u201cheavily (investing) in direct voter contact to expand the electorate.\u201d Questions about the theories that guided how Ossoff and his campaign spent their windfall were a recurring theme. One Georgia special election guarantee: Nothing will be resolved In an email, Robert Becker, who ran Sen. Bernie Sanders campaign in Iowa (and later, as deputy national field director, helped author its most famous win, in Michigan), was openly disdainful of what he suggested had been wasteful party management. \u201cWell, seems we spent $30 million to get 48% in Georgia \u2026 and next to nothing to get 48% in South Carolina. One has to wonder what impact $30 million would have if it was directed to state Democratic parties instead of a gazillion TV ads,\u201d he wrote. \u201cMaybe try standing for something and investing in grassroots instead would be the lesson?\u201d Other progressive activists asked why the district had become such an obsession for Democrats. Yes, Clinton did well there. But the logic, they insisted, was faulty. She might have overperformed in areas that went for Romney, like Georgia\u2019s sixth, but that was because her campaign targeted them \u2013 not because they are naturally ripe to shed the GOP. The strategy recalled a now infamously misguided prediction put forth by Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer ahead of the 2016 election, when he posited that \u201cfor every blue-collar Democrat we lose in western Pennsylvania, we will pick up two moderate Republicans in the suburbs in Philadelphia, and you can repeat that in Ohio and Illinois and Wisconsin.\u201d Enter here a close cousin of Schumer\u2019s theory, the \u201cPanera Bread path.\u201d Former top Clinton aide and Democratic strategist Brian Fallon, in a tweet on the night of the first round of voting in Georgia, held up the caf\u00e9 casual dining franchise \u2013 typically located in comfortable suburban precincts \u2013 as a rough guide for where Democrats should dedicate their resources ahead of the 2018 midterms. \u201cEven if he doesn\u2019t hit (50% and win outright) tonight, Ossoff is showing us the path to retaking the House,\u201d Fallon wrote. \u201cIt runs through the Panera Breads of America.\u201d Even if he doesn't hit 50 tonight, Ossoff is showing us the path to retaking the House. It runs through the Panera Breads of America. Progressives bristled, as much at the message as the messenger. \u201cWe won\u2019t defeat Trumpism by courting moderate Republicans in wealthy suburbs,\u201d Max Berger, a co-founder of #AllOfUs, the millennial progressive group, told CNN. \u201cTrumpism will be defeated by mobilizing voters who feel left behind \u2013 young people and working class people of all races \u2013 to take on the billionaires and the ruling class. The Democrat consultant class thinks a Panera strategy is their path back to power, but the left will no longer be led by those who offer no alternative.\u201d What the desired agenda looks like remains a rolling question. As the Sanders campaign slowly broke up, the activists and organizers who drove its success mostly scattered, seeking to grow the new coalitions brought together by the Vermont independent\u2019s progressive populist platform. Anna Galland, executive director of MoveOn.org, hit this vein in her post-election message. \u201cOssoff and the (Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee) missed an opportunity to make Republicans\u2019 attack on health care the key issue, and instead attempted to portray Ossoff as a centrist,\u201d she said in a statement, \u201cfocusing on cutting spending and coming out opposition to Medicare for All.\u201d It was hardly the \u201csweeping change,\u201d Galland argued, \u201cthat the American people are clamoring for.\u201d The string of defeats, going back to the 2014 midterms, provides further evidence, progressives and leftists say, that \u2013 without a uniquely talented group of candidates on the horizon \u2013 the party will no longer be able to paper over decades of either bland or, in the case of trade deals like NAFTA, destructive economic policies. \u201cI don\u2019t think many (national Democrats) have the charisma of Obama, the weird likability and material language of Sanders, or the conniving ability of Harry Reid,\u201d said Felix Biederman, co-host of the \u201cChapo Trap House\u201d podcast. \u201cIt\u2019s time for them to stop ratf\u2014\u2013g even the hint of a left in their party and activate those voters who usually don\u2019t vote.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: James A. Barnes is a member of the CNN Decision Desk and co-author of the forthcoming 2018 Almanac of American Politics. The dynamics of the 2016 presidential race continue to shape the nation\u2019s political terrain, and the latest evidence of that fact is this week\u2019s primary results for governor in Virginia. In both the Democratic and Republican races, an urban-rural divide defined the outcome of those contests. While these races have a tendency to hinge on local issues, Virginia is a key battleground during presidential and midterm election years. It\u2019s the first such state primary in a battleground since 2016, when President Donald Trump lost Virginia and Hillary Clinton carried the state\u2019s major metropolitan areas and their suburbs, particularly those outside of Washington, DC and Richmond. Ed Gillespie, the former lobbyist and Republican National Committee chairman, parlayed his establishment connections and a strong showing in an unsuccessful bid for the Senate in 2014 into a narrow 44%-43% GOP primary victory over Prince William County Board of Supervisors chairman Corey Stewart. Veteran GOP state Senator Frank Wagner of Virginia Beach finished a distant third with 14%, based on complete but unofficial returns. Gillespie owes his 4,300-vote statewide margin of victory to his strength in the close-in suburbs of Washington, DC, and Richmond, the state capital. Gillespie ekes out win in surprisingly close GOP Virginia primary In Fairfax County, the largest vote-producer in the primary just outside of Washington, Gillespie defeated Stewart, 48%-39%. Along with his two-to-one advantage over Stewart in nearby Arlington and Alexandria, Gillespie garnered roughly 7,700 votes more than Stewart in these areas. Stewart, who aligned himself closely with the views of Trump, ran well on his home turf, the more working-class Washington exurbs of Prince William, defeating Gillespie 60%-32%. Gillespie narrowly prevailed in the more upscale and better-educated exurbs of Loudoun County, 45%-43%. But in the rest of the exurbs beyond the Washington Beltway, Stewart won a plurality of the votes. Gillespie captured nearly 60% of the Republican primary votes cast in Richmond and its suburbs of Henrico County. He also narrowly carried the Hampton Roads region, Virginia\u2019s other main urban center, which includes Chesapeake, Newport News, Norfolk, Portsmouth and Virginia Beach, winning just over a third of the votes cast there. Had Wagner not been on the ballot, Gillespie likely would have increased his margins in this area as well. Outside of Lynchburg and the Roanoke metro area, Stewart won wide swaths of the central and western Virginia rural communities, and nearly engineered an upset that few observers gave him much of a chance to pull off. Virginia\u2019s \u201curban crescent,\u201d also played a critical role in the Democratic primary, where Lt. Gov. Ralph Northam handily defeated former Rep. Tom Perriello, 56%-44%. Northam, who had wide backing from the state\u2019s Democratic Party establishment, trounced Perriello in Virginia\u2019s Hampton Roads region. He won roughly seven-out-of-10 votes in this area that is next door to the state Senate district he once held. Northam also swept Richmond as well as its suburbs and exurbs. Democrats in Virginia made an important choice -- but it's not the one you think Perriello carried the 5th Congressional District in central Virginia, which he represented for one term ending in 2011, except for the portions that stretched into the Washington, DC, exurbs of Fauquier and Rappahannock Counties. He also won most of the rural counties in the Blue Ridge Mountains and Shenandoah Valley on the western rim of the state save for half a dozen counties in its southwestern corner, where coal production peaked 20 years ago. Perriello\u2019s staunch opposition to a proposed natural gas pipeline just north of the coal region may have hurt him among voters whose communities and culture are tied to fossil fuels. But Perriello, who had moved to Arlington in Northern Virginia after his defeat in the 2010 midterm elections, was unable to gain much traction in the Washington suburbs and exurbs, where a strong performance is essential for Democratic candidates. Perriello fought Northam to almost a draw in both Loudoun and Prince William Counties, but in wealthy and increasingly diverse Fairfax County, where almost one-out-of-six of the Democratic primary votes were cast; Northam defeated Perriello 60%-40%. Likewise, he beat Perriello by three-to-two margins in the Democratic bastions of Alexandria and Arlington. While Perriello\u2019s television advertising featured footage of President Barack Obama touting him in the 2010 midterm elections, Northam ran very strong in urban areas where African-American voters account for a large proportion of the electorate like Hampton, Norfolk, Petersburg and Portsmouth. Northam also swept rural counties with majority black populations like Brunswick, Charles City, Greensville and Sussex. In all of these jurisdictions, Northam won more than 70% of the vote. Roughly 542,000 ballots were cast in the Democratic primary and the GOP contest tallied some 366,000 votes. Virginia has almost 5.5 million registered voters, so the combined turnout was almost 17%. This is the first time since 1949 that both parties have conducted a primary for the same gubernatorial election, so turnout comparisons are difficult to make. In 2009, the last time the Democrats held a contested gubernatorial primary, just over 319,000 votes were cast. In 2005, Republicans held a noncompetitive primary for governor and some 175,000 ballots were tallied. In the 2013 gubernatorial general election, roughly 43% of the state\u2019s registered voters went to the polls.",

Trump didn't win the election, the Democratic Party lost the election\" Bernie Sanders\u2019 permanent \u201cpolitical revolution\u201d rolled into Chicago on Saturday night, as the Vermont senator called on progressive activists gathered here to beat back President Donald Trump\u2019s agenda while remaking the Democratic Party. Speaking to a crowd of buzzing supporters in former President Barack Obama\u2019s adopted hometown, Sanders ripped Trump\u2019s \u201cincredible hypocrisy\u201d and called the President a demagogue who makes \u201ceven a very conservative president like George W. Bush\u201d appealing in comparison. But it was his unsparing assessment of the party whose nomination he sought in 2016 that set off an audience of nearly 4,000 mostly dedicated \u201cBerniecrats.\u201d The theater at the #PeoplesSummit in Chicago is packed waiting for Bernie Sanders to talk. Someone's popular. pic.twitter.com/21XrQfL9i3 \u201cI am often asked by the media and others, \u2018How did it come about that Donald Trump, the most unpopular presidential candidate in the modern history of our country, won the election?\u2019\u201d he offered teasingly as chants of \u201cBernie would have won\u201d filled the hall. \u201cMy answer is that Trump didn\u2019t win the election, the Democratic Party lost the election,\u201d Sanders said, reviving his own past criticisms. It\u2019s a line he\u2019s used before, but this was a night for the old hits, and Sanders moved through his laundry list of issues over the course of nearly 55 minutes alone on stage before being joined by wife Jane Sanders and RoseAnn DeMoro, the executive director of National Nurses United, the event\u2019s union organizers, for a 15-minute question-and-answer session. Sanders was interrupted repeatedly throughout his remarks by applause and standing ovations, but also by supporters in red waving \u201cDraft Bernie\u201d banners and placards. The group wants Sanders to leave the Democratic mix and form his own \u201cPeople\u2019s Party\u201d ahead of the 2020 elections. Our Team in the @SenSanders #PPLSummit speech \u270a Support from @RoseAnnDeMoro \ud83d\udc9b\ud83d\udc4f for #DraftBernie We are on our way to a #PeoplesParty \ud83c\udf31 pic.twitter.com/BDzmRxvbLI The speech came nearly a year after the final contest in the Democratic primary that launched his \u201cpolitical revolution,\u201d and in what many here consider the validating glow of a British election that saw leftist Jeremy Corbyn\u2019s Labour party score massive gains in the UK Parliament. \u201cThey won those seats,\u201d Sanders said of Labour, \u201cnot by moving to the right, not by becoming more conciliatory \u2013 they won those seats by standing (up) to the ruling class of the UK.\u201d Lamenting Republican control of not just Washington but in state legislatures, Sanders said \u201cthe current model and the current strategy of the Democratic Party is an absolute failure.\u201d His prescription for the party was \u201cfundamental change\u201d and to \u201cknock on every damn door\u201d in search of new votes, even in historically inhospitable regions. \u201cStrong progressives could do far, far better than anyone imagined and \u2026 with proper organization and financial resources we can win in any district in the United States of America,\u201d Sanders said, a clear shot at party leaders who have been criticized on the left over a perceived lack of support for upstart congressional candidates in Montana and Kansas. Sanders also took a series of stinging shots at Trump, labeling him \u201cperhaps the worst and most dangerous president in the history of our country\u201d and a habitual liar. He argued that the Republican\u2019s populist campaign pitch was a deception, a Trojan horse that opened the White House doors to a parade of plutocrats. \u201cThis is a man who ran for president ,,, telling the people of this country that he was going to stand up for the working class, that he was going to stand up to the political establishment and then, once he got elected and without a second\u2019s hesitation he brings more billionaires into his administration than any president in history,\u201d Sanders said as the audience booed. \u201cAnd he hires the former president of Goldman Sachs to be his chief economic adviser.\u201d This is the second annual People\u2019s Summit, which is again being hosted in the sprawling McCormick Place convention center on Lake Michigan. Sanders did not speak at or attend the June 2016 gathering. As DeMoro took the stage following his remarks, she looked out and stopped to thank \u201call the \u2018Draft Bernie\u2019 people.\u201d \u201cI am with you,\u201d she said, and crowd erupted again.",

            "article_content": "Some party operatives see all the Russia talk as a distraction The GOP's push to repeal the Affordable Care Act is easier to explain Democrats are watching President Donald Trump\u2019s approval rating drop as bombshell after bombshell drops in the Russia investigation \u2013 and Trump\u2019s potential attempts to intervene in it. But as the party ramps up its efforts to take control of the House and hold onto a spate of red-state Senate seats in the 2018 midterm elections, some operatives see all the Russia talk as a distraction from an even more potent campaign issue: Health care. Even those following the Russia probe\u2019s twists and turns closely say the GOP\u2019s push to repeal the Affordable Care Act is easier to explain and matters more to moderates and working-class voters that Democrats need to win back. Poll: Trump far less credible than Comey -- but majorities don't trust either \u201cI would encourage all of our candidates to make sure that health care stays front and center of the election,\u201d said Guy Cecil, the chairman of the Democratic super PAC Priorities USA. \u201cThe visceral, gut reaction that people have makes it more powerful than Russia,\u201d he said. New polls out Wednesday showed that Americans are increasingly attuned to the Russia investigation \u2013 and the fallout from Trump\u2019s decision to fire FBI Director James Comey because he wouldn\u2019t shut that investigation down. An ABC/Washington Post poll found that 56% of Americans think Trump is trying to interfere in the Russia investigation, and 61% believe he fired Comey to protect himself \u2013 rather than for the good of the country. A Quinnipiac University poll found Trump\u2019s approval rating having dipped to a new low of 34%. When it comes to Trump\u2019s relationship with Russia, 31% say they believe he did something illegal, 29% unethical but not illegal and 32% that he did not do anything wrong. Still, many Democrats acknowledged that it\u2019s much easier to craft a digital advertisement or a 30-second television spot based on the direct pocketbook impact of the House GOP\u2019s health care measure \u2013 which the Senate is expected to address in the coming weeks \u2013 than it is to explain the breakneck developments in the Russia investigation. And health care, unlike the Russia investigation, is free from concerns about the trustworthiness of Comey, who many Democrats still blame for Hillary Clinton\u2019s loss. Poll: Trump's approval rating dips to 34% Voters, Cecil said, have \u201ca gut understanding; it\u2019s a day-by-day understanding of the impact of health care. They understand what it means to have coverage. The fact that it affects something that is personal, that happens to them daily, makes it a very powerful issue.\u201d No matter the outcome of the Russia investigation, \u201chealth care will be a cornerstone issue in 2018,\u201d said Markos Moulitsas, the founder and publisher of the liberal blog Daily Kos. \u201cIt motivates the base like few other issues, and more and more, moderates are aligned with liberals,\u201d Moulitsas said. \u201cIt\u2019s a win-win.\u201d In the backlash over the Republican health care efforts, many progressives see a new opportunity to counter \u2013 if the party returns to power \u2013 with a push for a national single-payer, or \u201cMedicare for all,\u201d plan. But Russia also gives progressives an opening to call for Trump\u2019s impeachment \u2013 something the party\u2019s leaders on Capitol Hill have not yet done. \u201cRussia shows just how anti-democratic the Republican Party is, happy to let a foreign power intervene in our elections in the pursuit of power. It proves the dishonesty of Trump and his regime and his party. It proves their incompetence,\u201d Moulitsas said. \u201cBut most importantly, it provides a real basis for impeachment. So the issue isn\u2019t \u2018what Trump did was bad, look!\u2019 but \u2018we have no option given what Trump did except impeachment,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cSo 2018 will be about two things: impeach Trump, and let\u2019s get single-payer health care. And both those issues will mobilize the liberal base like nothing else, and neither should turn off moderate voters.\u201d Zac Petkanas, who was immersed in the Russia investigation while leading the rapid response efforts of Clinton\u2019s campaign and then the Democratic National Committee before launching his own firm, said there are simple ways for Democratic candidates to make their case against Trump on Russia: A president who cheated the system and a congressional GOP unwilling to defend the country and hold him accountable. \u201cAnd that goes to the corruption that people already believe exists in Washington; that goes to the abuse of power that people see running rampant in this city,\u201d Petkanas said. Still, he acknowledged, the Russia investigation doesn\u2019t pack the clear, personal impact of health care. \u201cWhen I\u2019m talking to candidates,\u201d Petkanas said, \u201cI tell them that they should be saying \u2018health care\u2019 five times for every time that they say the word \u2018Russia.\u2019\u201d",

            "article_content": "North Korea still faces hurdles, the director of the Defense Intelligence Agency said The testimony came days after a North Korean ballistic missile test North Korea will eventually obtain a nuclear weapon capable of hitting the United States if left unchecked, a top US intelligence official said. \u201cIf left on its current trajectory, the regime will ultimately succeed in fielding a nuclear-armed missile capable of threatening the United States homeland,\u201d said Lt. Gen. Vincent Stewart, the director of the Defense Intelligence Agency. \u201cWhile nearly impossible to predict when this capability will be operational, the North Korean regime is committed and is on a pathway where this capability is inevitable.\u201d The only hurdle left, Stewart said in a hearing before the Senate Armed Services Committee on Tuesday, is finding a way for its ballistic missile to re-enter the atmosphere. Perfecting re-entry is \u201creally a matter of enough trial and error to make that work,\u201d Stewart said. \u201cThey understand the physics, so it\u2019s just a matter of design.\u201d Ballistic missiles fly in a parabolic route, exiting and entering the Earth\u2019s atmosphere, while cruise missiles fly in a straight line within the atmosphere. Stewart and Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats spoke days after North Korea tested its second ballistic missile in the span of a week. That missile test was considered one of the country\u2019s most successful ever, analysts said. A preliminary US intelligence analysis indicated there was successful re-entry into the atmosphere, a significant leap forward in Pyongyang\u2019s missile program, two US officials told CNN. Though it appears North Korea hasn\u2019t developed a working intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) capable of reaching the contiguous 48 states of the United States, it has made significant progress on shorter-range ones. Both Coats and Stewart stressed that Pyongyang further perfects its missile technology with each test. \u201cThey\u2019ve certainly demonstrated a range of missiles, a range of fuel types, a range of boosters,\u201d Stewart said. Coats and Stewart were both asked if North Korea had the capability to use a nuclear weapon against US allies Japan or South Korea. Both declined to answer. Much of the hearing was focused on reports that US President Donald Trump asked Coats to publicly deny evidence of cooperation between his campaign and Russia during the 2016 election. Coats said he would not speak publicly about his private conversations with Trump. The missile tests are half the equation. North Korea must also create a viable nuclear warhead it can fit atop a long-range missile in order to reach its goal of developing a nuclear weapon that could hit the United States. Many experts believe North Korea already has developed a nuclear weapon, though it\u2019s not clear what type of missiles it could be mounted on, says Tong Zhao, a Beijing-based fellow at the Carnegie-Tsinghua Center for Global Policy\u2019s Nuclear Policy Program. President Donald Trump appeared to bolster that claim in a leaked transcript of an April phone call between him and Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte published by the Intercept and also obtained by the Washington Post and The New York Times. \u201c(Kim) has got the powder, but he doesn\u2019t have the delivery system \u2013 their rockets keep crashing,\u201d Trump said. A senior US official briefed on the call independently verified the basics of the conversation to CNN. CNN has reached out to the White House for comment, but has not received a response. The quotes were reportedly part of a Philippine government transcript. The Philippines Foreign Ministry had no comment on the transcript, but noted there is \u201ccriminal and civil liability attached to the hacking, unauthorized disclosure and use of illegally or inadvertently-obtained confidential government documents.\u201d Though there have been reports of the United States using cyber methods to interfere with North Korean missile launches, Trump\u2019s response may show he does not appreciate how far along the North Koreans are in perfecting their missile technology, said John Delury, a professor of International Relations at the Yonsei University Graduate School of International Relations. \u201cHe\u2019s underestimating their missile program,\u201d Delury said. \u201cHe\u2019s wrong about how they\u2019re doing. They\u2019re making progress on their rocketry and missile program.\u201d During the phone call, Trump also revealed that two US submarines were in the region. \u201cWe have a lot of firepower over there,\u201d Trump noted. \u201cWe have two submarines, the best in the world. We have two nuclear submarines, not that we want to use them at all.\u201d It was previously reported that only one submarine \u2013 the USS Michigan, an Ohio-class guided-missile submarine \u2013 had docked in South Korea. US Naval Forces Korea publicly said the sub\u2019s visit was routine, but quietly officials told CNN its presence was meant to send a strong message to Pyongyang. CNN\u2019s Elise Labott, Barbara Starr, Zahra Ullah and journalist Buena Bernal contributed to this report",

At their spring gala Tuesday night, the Center for Popular Democracy Action will unveil a new $80 million effort to coordinate the work of dozens of smaller progressive groups from around the country. The activist organization\u2019s new initiative \u2013 which, as a 501(c)(4) nonprofit political organization, is not required to disclose its donors \u2013 arrives as part of a broader effort on the left to channel anger at the Trump administration into a lasting power base, with the ability to influence policy debates within the Democratic Party while boosting candidates on the local, state and federal levels. The growing network spans 32 states, with 48 local partners, as part of concentrated effort to mobilize new voters \u2013 pushing back on voter ID laws and partisan gerrymandering efforts while pumping up campaigns for automatic voter registration programs \u2013 ahead of the 2018 midterms and 2020 general election. Organizers say they are also targeting six state legislatures they believe are ripe to flip to Democratic control. Affiliated groups \u201cknow how to win on the local level, now they want to turn that attention to building these campaigns on the national level,\u201d CPD Action Network President and co-Executive Director Jennifer Epps-Addison told CNN. \u201cThe past four months has seen an unprecedented wave of activism and grassroots energy, but only with a long-term investment in organizing can we turn this moment into a movement,\u201d Democratic National Committee chair Tom Perez told CNN in a statement. \u201cI am excited that CPD Action is mobilizing their national network toward building political influence from the ground up.\u201d Four months into the Trump era, traditionally local groups are seeking broader alliances in their fight against federal efforts to reverse regional gains and crack down on traditionally liberal strongholds. \u201cIt\u2019s no longer enough to be in California and be satisfied by having a progressive city council or to be in New York and to able to pass things like paid sick days,\u201d Epps-Addison said. \u201cBeing located in a progressive city or progressive state is no longer enough to protect our families. \u2026 We need to mobilize, unite and defend sanctuary cities and policies that protect immigrant communities and local power.\u201d Minnesota Rep. Keith Ellison, the deputy DNC chair, will be honored at the Tuesday night gathering, which will count among its co-chairs union leaders Richard Trumka, president of the AFL-CIO, and the SEIU\u2019s Mary Kay Henry. In an email, Ellison touted the network as another step toward solidifying grassroots opposition to the Trump administration agenda. \u201cThis national network, led by working class people of color and immigrants, will supply the power and the fight we need to resist the Trump administration\u2019s all-out assault on American values,\u201d he said. \u201cI look forward to standing with CPD Action\u2019s leaders in the streets and in Congress to win real progressive change.\u201d The increase in resources will also centralize the decision-making process. Organizers say a board of directors, comprising executive directors and member leaders from CPD Action\u2019s partners, will prioritize how and where the new resources are directed.",

            "article_content": "He was on Thursday's \"The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon\" The interview was polished, as if workshopped with political consultants Dwayne \u201cThe Rock\u201d Johnson appeared on Thursday\u2019s episode of \u201cThe Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon,\u201d and if you didn\u2019t know any better, you would have thought he was a veteran politician. Fallon asked The Rock about his recent GQ cover story in which he reiterated the possibility he could one day run for president. \u201cWhy are people making such a connection or such a big deal about this?\u201d Fallon asked. The 45-year-old movie star\u2019s response, and in fact the entire interview, was polished \u2013 hitting on multiple talking points politicians would want to get to in an interview like this, as if workshopped with political consultants. Here are the highlights: \u201cA lot of people want to see a different leadership today, I\u2019m sorry, not different, but better leadership today.\u201d If you want the job, you have to tell voters why you\u2019re better than the guy who has it now. Here, The Rock hits President Donald Trump on leadership, an area he\u2019s not doing too well. According to a Quinnipiac poll earlier this month, 56% of respondents said Trump does not have good leadership skills, including 13% of Republicans and 59% of independents. \u201cThe surge and groundswell since (the GQ article was published) has been so amazing.\u201d Grassroots support in politics is something candidates and causes are always hoping for, especially today, following the populist fervor of the 2016 race. If you truly have a \u201cgroundswell\u201d of support, that means you\u2019re of the people, not the establishment. The Rock\u2019s Q score, basically the Hollywood equivalent of an approval rating for politicians, except it tracks celebrity likability, is high. Henry Schafer, a spokesman for the Q Scores Company, told the New York Times in 2015, \u201cin terms of consumer appeal, he\u2019s in the league there with Brad Pitt,\u201d with a score the Times described as \u201cconsistently above average.\u201d \u201cApparently he\u2019s always had a strong emotional bond with consumers,\u201d Schafer said. And the Fast & Furious film franchise he stars in has grossed more than $1.5 billion over its lifetime, according to Box Office Mojo. People like watching The Rock. \u201cI think over the years I\u2019ve become a guy that a lot of people kind of relate to: Get up early in the morning at a ridiculous hour and go to work, and spend time with the troops, take care of my family. I love taking care of people.\u201d The enduring popularity of the term \u201cbeer test,\u201d or how the candidate that voters would rather have a beer with could be more likely to win an election as shorthand to describe likeability, is evidence of how much we value the \u201ceveryman\u201d in our politics. Being a wealthy celebrity isn\u2019t exactly the best way to endear yourself to working class voters, but it\u2019s possible (see: Trump, Donald). The Rock has always emphasized his upbringing and the work he\u2019s done to get to where he is. His Instagram captions are littered with stories like how he used to steal Snickers bars when he was young, poor and hungry on his way to work out, or how one week he averaged three and a half hours of sleep because of work and travel but still made it into the gym. \u201cMore poise, less noise.\u201d You can often boil down successful candidacies into short, direct phrases. Think Trump\u2019s \u201cMake America great again\u201d or former President Barack Obama\u2019s \u201cYes we can,\u201d something that even voters only casually paying attention to the campaign are aware of and understand.

            "article_content": "Candidate Trump connected with New Hampshire voters on opioid crisis Now advocates are asking what President Trump is going to do about it Erin Canterbury had voted for New Hampshire Democrats for over a decade. Then she met Donald Trump at a roundtable on the state\u2019s opioid epidemic, where she heard the Republican candidate talk about his own family\u2019s history with addiction. She trusted Trump and, withstanding vocal criticism from her friends, proudly backed him over Hillary Clinton. Months into Trump\u2019s presidency, though, Canterbury and a host of other opioid advocates in New Hampshire feel duped by the President, not only shocked that his administration has done little to combat an issue he promised to address, but worried that he has done the opposite and is now risking gains advocates have worked hard to make. \u201cI expected him to do something,\u201d Canterbury said. \u201cI didn\u2019t expect it to be fixed, but I expected something.\u201d 'Grey death': The powerful street drug that's puzzling authorities Trump, then a political neophyte, kicked off his presidential campaign in New Hampshire with sweeping promises about combating the state\u2019s opioid epidemic, a nagging problem that can be felt across the Granite State. The boisterous businessman pledged to boost local clinics, help those who are already hooked on opioids and stop the flow of drugs coming into the state. The issue was so important that days before the 2016 election, when time is at its most precious, Trump headlined an opioid roundtable where he met face-to-face with those directly impacted by the issue. \u201cI just want to let the people of New Hampshire know that I\u2019m with you 1000%, you really taught me a lot,\u201d he said before promising to help people who \u201care so seriously addicted.\u201d But months into Trump\u2019s presidency, Canterbury and others feel the President has failed to do what he promised. \u201cHe hasn\u2019t done anything thus far,\u201d said the 39-year-old mother of two, who is almost seven years sober after getting addicted to prescription painkillers. \u201cI don\u2019t want to say I completely regret it. But he hasn\u2019t done anything.\u201d These feelings have the chance to undermine Trump with the base of energized voters that catapulted him from a reality TV board room to the Oval Office. A series of post-2016 studies, including one released by researchers at Pennsylvania State University, found that Trump outperformed other Republicans in both rural and urban counties with the highest drug, alcohol and suicide mortality rates. New hepatitis C infections triple due to opioid epidemic Trump won 18 of the top 25 states with the highest number of drug overdoses in 2015, according to data from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. And a recent study from Public Religion Research Institute found that white working-class voters, a demographic key to Trump\u2019s base and electoral success, were not only more likely to be impacted by the opioid crisis, but also a majority of them said it was a \u201cmajor problem\u201d in their community. Opioid overdoses have reached epidemic levels, according to the CDC. A study from the agency found that 25% of all drug overdose deaths were related to heroin in 2015. That number was just 6% in 1999. Concerns in the opioid community started months ago when the Trump-backed health care plan proposed ending the requirement that addiction services and mental health treatment be covered under Medicaid in the 31 states that expanded the health care program. The Republican plan, a version of which passed the House earlier this month, would leave it up to states to decide whether to cover drug treatment \u2013 a decision experts said would put the most vulnerable at far greater risk. The new front line in opioid abuse fight: public restrooms \u201cThe bill is an absolute betrayal of what Trump represented on the campaign trail,\u201d Kraig Moss, whose son died of an overdose, told CNN in March. \u201cI feel betrayed.\u201d Then, earlier this month, a draft memo obtained by CNN on Trump\u2019s 2018 budget brought to light plans to virtually eliminate the Office of National Drug Control Policy by slashing their funding by 94%. That, said Tym Rourke, a treatment advocate who serves as chairman of New Hampshire\u2019s commission on the issue, has created widespread unease because the memo proposed cutting the Drug-Free Communities Support program, a federal program that has provided grants to fight opioids in cities and towns like Raymond, Nashua, Rochester and Dover. \u201cUncertainty is sort of the mood of the movement here in New Hampshire,\u201d he said. \u201cWe are working to build our state\u2019s capacity, to build the workforce, but it is hard to do that in a moment where the services we have built could potentially be at risk.\u201d The biggest concern, Rourke said, is that Trump\u2019s actions could mean local efforts \u201cmay have to slow down, stop or even see a rollback of our progress.\u201d Trump fills out commission tasked with fighting opioid abuse Most recently, opioid advocates who favor treatment over jail time for abusers grew concerned when Attorney General Jeff Sessions instructed federal prosecutors to charge suspect with the most serious offense you can prove, including drug crimes. Joe Hannon, a former Republican in the New Hampshire House of Representatives who introduced Trump at the opioid roundtable that he attended days before the 2016 election, said he is particularly worried at some of the rhetoric coming out of Sessions\u2019 Justice Department. \u201cEnforcement has not been very effective up too this point,\u201d he said. \u201cWe have had a war on drugs for quite some time now and it is not getting better with what we are doing so I am not sure the same old approach is the answer.\u201d Overall, Hannon said Trump\u2019s actions are \u201ca little concerning\u201d but that it was \u201ctoo soon to tell\u201d how effective the president will be on fighting opioid abuse. But on enforcement, the lawmaker worried. Rand Paul: Sessions' sentencing plan would ruin lives Hannon briefly met Sessions at a picnic before the 2016 election, where he talked to him about drug enforcement. When Sessions was named attorney general, Hannon said he was \u201ca little concerned there was going to be a heavier hand as far as going after people suffering from substance abuse.\u201d And now those fears appear to be coming true. Rourke agree with Hannon. \u201cI do hear concern in the recovery community on whether we going to go back into the days where drug use was seen as crime and not a disease,\u201d he said. Despite these moves, the White House has tried to spur action on the issue from Washington. After signing an executive order establishing a commission to fight opioids earlier this year, the Trump administration tasked New Jersey Gov. Chris Christie to lead the bipartisan group, which included Democrats Gov. Roy Cooper of North Carolina and former Rep. Patrick Kennedy of Rhode Island, along with Republican Gov. Charlie Baker of Massachusetts. Christie defends Trump amid crises, FBI director vacancy \u201cI think when it comes to the opioid crisis, the President, both during the campaign, the transition and now as president, has made it very clear of his commitment to figuring out how we can address this crisis that plagues so many,\u201d White House press secretary Sean Spicer said. Secretary of Health and Human Services Tom Price visited New Hampshire, Virginia and West Virginia last week to talk opioids, and a White House official downplayed any budgetary moves the administration has considered on fighting opioids, arguing that the 2018 budget \u201cis still under review and nothing the media is reporting reflects any finalized White House policy.\u201d \u201cThe Executive Branch commitment to fighting the drug problem goes well beyond a single office,\u201d the official said. \u201cThere are more than 90 programs across 16 departments and the Judicial Branch.\u201d But treatment advocates are largely unmoved but the commission. \u201cIf he had really asked and listened to anybody close to the issue, they would tell him that he has done everything wrong so far,\u201d said Dean Lemrire, a recovery advocate who used to be in treatment for alcohol and heroin addiction. Police officer overdoses after brushing fentanyl powder off his uniform Though Lemrire didn\u2019t vote for Trump \u2013 saying he reluctantly backed Clinton \u2013 he is more upset that he meets so many people who did who are now upset. \u201cI am bummed out that he is threatening the health care that the people who are hardest hit,\u201d he said. \u201cThe people who are hardest hit are his voters, the people who are hardest hit by this epidemic are his voters.\u201d Canterbury, now worried that Trump was just being \u201cpolitically expedient\u201d when he promised to fight opioids, expressed similar concerns. Getting treatment changed Canterbury\u2019s life. She now works as an advocate for drug treatment and wants everyone who needs it to have the experience she had. She described the epidemic as the \u201cbiggest issue\u201d in her life and her primary reason for backing Trump is 2016. \u201cI don\u2019t want to talk to another mom who has lost their child,\u201d she said. To her, Trump seemed to care about the issue more than Clinton and that was what won her over in the end. New potential for marijuana: Treating drug addiction \u201cVoting for him, was a huge step out of what I truly usually do and believe,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was a stretch for me.\u201d What sealed the deal, Canterbury said, was when Trump, during his roundtable before Election Day, told the group about his brother Fred\u2019s struggle with alcohol, a fight that eventually killed him at the age of 43 in 1981. The tragic lesson left an impact on the President, who long ago swore off alcohol. \u201cHe seemed like he cared,\u201d she said. \u201cHe said if he won he would bring us all to the White House to talk about it. It sounded like he cared.\u201d But now Canterbury is questioning that instinct, worried that the man for whom she crossed party lines to vote was just trying to win her over. \u201cI feel like this issue now goes on the back burner for him,\u201d she said. \u201cBut he needs to know, \u2018no, we aren\u2019t going to shut up about this in New Hampshire.\u2019\u201d Correction: This story was updated to reflect that Tym Rourke is currently the chairman of New Hampshire's commission and Dean Lemrire is no longer in treatment.",

            "article_content": "Anthony Weiner sexted a 15-year-old and Donald Trump won the White House. One didn\u2019t cause the other, but several long-running narratives exploded together in a way that ultimately and in hindsight sent Hillary Clinton\u2019s campaign floundering and gave Donald Trump\u2019s new hope in the waning days of the election. There is an undeniable through-line between the investigation into Weiner\u2019s proclivity to sending lewd message via text, on this occasion victimizing a teenage student, and Trump\u2019s 2016 victory. Look at this timeline: Underage girl allegedly reaches out to Weiner on Twitter and he starts online relationship with her, according to the Daily Mail. Court documents released Friday suggest the relationship carried on online until March and that Weiner knew the minor was 15 and that he transferred sexually explicit material to her. FBI Director James Comey announces at a bombshell press conference there is not enough evidence to seek charges against either Clinton or her staff for their handling of classified information during her time as secretary of state. He upbraids the candidate as irresponsible, but the campaign hopes this puts a lingering issue about her trustworthiness behind them. CNN reports that then-US Attorney Preet Bharara in New York is investigating allegations first reported in the Daily Mail, that Weiner had carried on a sexting relationship with the minor. CNN's late October report: FBI reviewing new Clinton emails Comey tells Congress in a letter that new information from a separate investigation, which we later learn to be the one involving Weiner, has led them to re-start the inquiry into Clinton\u2019s treatment of classified information as secretary of state. Clinton has since said this letter cost her the election. FBI obtains search warrant for Weiner\u2019s computer in order to look for information related to Clinton\u2019s time as secretary of state. Comey later testifies that the computer contains messages forwarded by Huma Abedin, a top Clinton aide and Weiner\u2019s husband. Abedin forwarded messages for reasons as mundane as to print them. None of the information on the computer is marked as classified. But it doesn\u2019t matter since this issue is again front and center. FBI tells Congress \u2013 two days before election day! \u2013 that the new information does not change their determination that neither Clinton nor her staff should face charges for their handling of classified information. Trump wins the presidential election after spending the campaign maligning Clinton as \u201ccrooked\u201d and saying she should be in jail. This is obviously reductive logic. Clinton could have never hired Abedin. She could have not made the decision to keep emails on a private email server. She could have been vice president instead of secretary of state. Comey could have kept quiet about the investigation until after the election. There\u2019s an unending rabbit hole of what-ifs. But the crux of what created the last-minute decision for Comey was the September allegation against Weiner and the US Attorney\u2019s ensuing investigation. There are many reasons Trump won the election. He tapped into white working class frustration that helped him pull the Rust Belt foundation out of Democrats\u2019 political coalition, for instance. Hillary Clinton was a candidate who inspired apathy among the rest of the Democratic coalition. You could write a book \u2013 people already have! \u2013 about what happened that led to her loss and Trump\u2019s victory. But Clinton herself has blamed Comey for costing her the election. \u201cIf the election had been on October 27, I would be your president,\u201d she recently told CNN\u2019s Christiane Amanpour. Weiner pleaded guilty Friday to transferring obscene material to a minor. He was released on bail until his sentencing and he\u2019ll have to register as a sex offender. The crime carries a maximum penalty of ten years in prison, although it is possible he could not serve any jail time. All that is really besides the point for the vast majority of Americans. What matters is that either you believe Comey\u2019s October surprise swayed the election or you don\u2019t. Hillary Clinton does. And there\u2019s no real way to look at the chain reaction of decisions and events that led to Comey\u2019s letter to Congress about Clinton\u2019s treatment of classified information other than it began with Anthony Weiner\u2019s sexting.",

            "article_content": "Former Vice President Joe Biden still isn\u2019t done with Hillary Clinton and the 2016 election \u2013 and that may be why he refuses to rule out running again for president in 2020. In an interview at a hedge fund conference in Las Vegas on Thursday, Biden said this of Clinton: \u201cI never thought she was a great candidate. I thought I was a great candidate.\u201d Boom goes the dynamite! If you\u2019re surprised by Biden running down Clinton, you haven\u2019t been paying close attention to the former vice president\u2019s utterances. Lucky for you, I have! In late March, Biden said this about why Democrats lost the 2016 campaign: \u201cWhat happened was that this was the first campaign that I can recall where my party did not talk about what it always stood for \u2013 and that was how to maintain a burgeoning middle class. You didn\u2019t hear a single solitary sentence in the last campaign about that guy working on the assembly line making $60,000 bucks a year and a wife making $32,000 as a hostess in restaurant.\u201d Late last year, Biden was more blunt in an interview with the Los Angeles Times\u2019 Mike Memoli: \u201cI don\u2019t think she ever really figured it out,\u201d Biden told Memoli of the underlying message of Clinton\u2019s campaign. \u201cAnd by the way, I think it was really hard for her to decide to run.\u201d Biden added: \u201cShe thought she had no choice but to run. That, as the first woman who had an opportunity to win the presidency, I think it was a real burden on her.\u201d In announcing he wouldn\u2019t run for president in October 2015, Biden took a shot at Clinton\u2019s debate response that the enemy she was most proud of was \u201cprobably the Republicans.\u201d Here\u2019s what Biden said: \u201cI believe we have to end the divisive, partisan politics that is ripping this country apart and I believe we can. It\u2019s mean spirited. It\u2019s petty. And it\u2019s gone on for much too long. I don\u2019t believe, like some do, that it\u2019s naive to talk to Republicans. I don\u2019t think we should look at Republicans as our enemies. They are our opposition. They\u2019re not our enemies.\u201d Yes, of course, Biden endorsed Clinton shortly after the never-ending Democratic primary fight between the former Secretary of State and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders ended. And yes, even in this latest interview in Las Vegas, Biden made clear that \u201cHillary would have been a really good president.\u201d But that was \u2013 and is \u2013 simply political box-checking. Biden\u2019s real \u2013 and far more negative \u2013 feelings about Clinton are exposed in the long arc of his comments about why she lost and why she was never a terribly good candidate. The origin of all of this? Hard to pin down exactly. After all, Biden and the Clintons have been circling each other for decades in the Democratic political orbit.  Any time two ambitious people are around each other for that long, there are always slights \u2013 real or imagined \u2013 and grudges. Biden\u2019s antipathy toward Clinton\u2019s 2016 bid in particular, however, is a bit more easy to trace. He quite clearly viewed himself as the logical heir to the legacy of outgoing President Barack Obama. But Clinton, from the start of the campaign, seized that mantle and ran with it. By the time Biden emerged from the initial shock and grief of the death of his oldest son, Beau, in May 2015, it was already too late \u2013 a fact he acknowledged in bowing out of the race formally in October of that year. Clinton had consolidated enough of the Obama coalition that it would have been next to impossible for Biden to claw it back from her. Circumstances made it impossible for Biden to run in 2016. But that never meant that he thought Clinton was any great shakes as a candidate. Or that she was right to have run as Obama\u2019s heir. Or that Biden didn\u2019t regret that he never got the chance to make the case himself for why the principles of the Obama-Biden White House were the right ones for the country for the next four years. \u201cI regret it every day,\u201d Biden said in January 2016 of his decision not to run. \u201cBut it was the right decision for my family and for me. And I plan on staying deeply involved.\u201d \u201cDeeply involved\u201d could well mean a third run for president for Biden in 2020. \u201cCould I? Yes,\u201d Biden said Thursday. \u201cWould I? Probably not.\u201d If Biden, who would be 78 in 2020, did decide to run, it would be about himself, sure. But it would also be about proving to himself and the world that he could run the campaign Hillary Clinton never could.",

Sherrod Brown is a member of the Senate Finance Committee, which examines trade deals The Ohio Democrat is up for re-election next year in a state Donald Trump won Sen. Sherrod Brown is extending a Democratic hand to President Donald Trump as his administration prepares to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement. Brown, an Ohio populist who for years has railed against the same trade deals Trump often bashes, is sending a letter to the President on Monday outlining a four-point plan to overhaul NAFTA. Brown is calling on Trump to secure agreements from Mexico and Canada that \u201cBuy American\u201d provisions won\u2019t be weakened in negotiations \u2013 and that Mexico, in particular, will enforce labor and environmental standards, rather than allowing lax conditions that have led companies to ship jobs there to continue. \u201cI\u2019m sending him a letter asking him to do four things in the negotiations,\u201d he told CNN\u2019s Alisyn Camerota Monday on \u201cNew Day.\u201d \u201cAll four really matter for a better trade agreement among Canada, Mexico and the United States.\u201d \u201cThe first is get up front commitments on \u2018Buy America,\u2019 and anti-outsourcing provisions. Second is make sure you don\u2019t play one American worker against another meaning farmers against manufactures,\u201d Brown added. \u201cThat\u2019s important that the President mediate that in these negotiations.\u201d The vocal fair-trader is also urging Trump to develop sector-by-sector negotiating plans to avoid horse-trading one industry\u2019s protections for another\u2019s. Brown, a member of the Senate Finance Committee, which has jurisdiction over trade deals, has been in close contact with Trump\u2019s White House on the topic. More recently, Brown discussed NAFTA\u2019s renegotiation with Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross last week, and has also spoken with Robert Lighthizer, Trump\u2019s nominee for US trade representative. \u201cAmerican jobs shouldn\u2019t be up for negotiation and American workers can\u2019t be traded away as bargaining chips,\u201d Brown said in a statement accompanying his letter. \u201cBy setting high standards, putting workers ahead of corporations and refusing to compromise on outsourcing, we can create the best possible deal for all American workers.\u201d RELATED: If Trump wants a new NAFTA, here\u2019s what he has to do Brown has reason to work with Trump beyond their shared skepticism about trade deals: He is up for re-election in the 2018 midterms in a state where Trump defeated Hillary Clinton by 9 percentage points. That means he\u2019ll need to outperform the Democratic presidential nominee with white working-class voters in order to win a third term. Brown also wants a renegotiated NAFTA to abolish a mechanism that allows companies to ask an independent, international arbiter to decide whether countries\u2019 laws and regulations meet that country\u2019s free trade commitments. And Brown wants US trade proposals to be made public both before and after negotiating rounds, increasing transparency as the deal is hashed out. Before Trump\u2019s inauguration, Brown sent him a letter calling on him to abandon the Trans-Pacific Partnership \u2013 a massive trade deal involving 12 Pacific Rim nations that had been a second-term priority for former President Barack Obama. Trump responded with a hand-written note thanking Brown for the \u201cgreat letter\u201d and saying, \u201cI will never let our workers down.\u201d \u201cAs I wrote to you right after your election, many candidates have promised big changes in US trade policy only to cave to corporate pressure upon reaching the White House,\u201d Brown wrote in Monday\u2019s letter to Trump. He added, \u201cBy rethinking the US approach to negotiations and obtaining pre-negotiation commitments from our trading partners as outlined above, you can fulfill your campaign promises, set a new standard for a trade policy, and ensure our trade agreements benefit US workers and communities.\u201d RELATED: Small Ohio town counts on Trump to stave off plant closures CNN\u2019s Eugene Scott contributed to this report.",

The early returns have not been promising. At a kick-off event in Maine on Monday, the audience roared for Sanders and booed at the mention of the DNC. A night later, Perez and Sanders sat together for a joint interview on MSNBC. \u201cDo you consider yourself a Democrat?\u201d host Chris Hayes asked the Vermont senator. \u201cNo, I am an independent,\u201d Sanders replied, before launching into a lengthy explanation of what ailed the party \u2013 whose nomination he sought in 2016 \u2013 and what it needs to do in order to reclaim power. Hayes then turned to Perez with a question on single payer health care, or \u201cMedicare-for-all.\u201d Did the new DNC chair, now twisting in his seat inches from one of the policy\u2019s most high-profile proponents, support it? \u201cWell, you know, we want to make sure that health care is a right,\u201d Perez began, never quite offering a coherent answer.

The moderate wing of the party \u2013 derisively termed \u201cliberals\u201d by those further left \u2013 is loath to give over power to the progressive insurgency, which holds up Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton\u2019s loss as proof Democrats needs to fundamentally remake \u2013 and elevate \u2013 their economic message. The stalemate threatens the party\u2019s prospects in 2018 and portends a bloody presidential primary ahead of the 2020 general election. Sanders, Perez unity tour is off to a bumpy start That\u2019s why Perez, fresh off a contentious campaign to take over the DNC, is sharing a stage and sitting down for joint interviews with Sanders. The former Obama administration labor secretary, an accomplished progressive in his own right, is the establishment figure in this set-up. Sanders, as always, is the firebrand, though now he comes with a power base of passionate supporters the party is desperate to win over. To the establishment liberal wing, Sanders\u2019 screeds come off as something between grating and condescending. Why, they ask, is someone who refuses to identify as a Democrat, being given so much say in the party\u2019s future? The nerve! On the flip side, many progressive Democrats regard Sanders, along with a few others, like Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, as the left\u2019s answer to the corporate influence \u2013 and political incompetence \u2013 it believes poisoned Clinton\u2019s candidacy. They view Sanders as a uniquely powerful bulwark against the party\u2019s embrace of policies (free trade, austerity, privatization, etc.) they despise. Maxine Waters is having a moment Sanders has not been shy in making the argument. \u201cDonald Trump did not win the election \u2013 the Democrats lost the election!\u201d he said (again) during an event in Miami on Wednesday night. \u201cThat means rebuilding the Democratic Party, making it a grassroots party, a party from the bottom on up!\u201d Perez might agree. Or not. Either way, his job is more complicated. The DNC, more than a policy shop, is a massive political organization dedicated to raising money and making choices about where to allocate it in the service of electing as many Democrats as possible. Now, that decision-making process is obviously tied in to its own values, but winning is the clear priority. Should he push progressive candidate who supports all the party\u2019s core values \u2013 and what are those core values? \u2013 or a more moderate candidate better suited to a specific location? These fault lines are hardly new, but they were magnified after Clinton lost to Trump in November \u2013 a result that was more roundly shocking than the Sanders brigade, which has made a meme of its claim that \u201cBernie would have won,\u201d might currently let on. Perez wins DNC chairmanship On the eve of the election, it was not just large segments of the political media and Clinton supporters and allies who expected her to win. Leading progressive activists, many of them Sanders backers, were confident, too, and expressed optimism, at least in private, that a Clinton administration would provide them with a seat at the table. A day after the vote, their best laid plans in tatters, the more organized elements of the progressive resistance begin to mobilize. Though mostly decentralized, it generally focused on two common goals: turn back President Trump\u2019s agenda and remake the Democratic Party in a way that would make it more appealing to working class voters. On the first count, the movement has been remarkably successful. Progressive pressure, from the streets to the halls of Congress, stiffened the backs of elected officials who, in the early days of the new administration, signaled a cautious willingness to do business with Trump. Blowback against the GOP\u2019s Obamacare overhaul was strict and wicked. The bill, thanks in part to Republicans\u2019 own internal divisions, never made it to the House floor. Senate Democrats forced Republicans to \u201cgo nuclear\u201d with their filibuster of Supreme Court Justice Neil Gorsuch\u2019s nomination. But the latter charge \u2013 charting a course forward for Democrats \u2013 has been much more complicated and, if only in the space of a few months, plainly less successful. That\u2019s the history. Whether the party is able to confront it and negotiate the future in goodwill is less certain. The first days of the Sanders-Perez \u201cunity tour\u201d suggest the conversation has yet to really begin.",

            "article_content": "Sanders still considers himself an independent despite role on DNC tour Perez introduction is met with boos in Maine The DNC\u2019s unity tour this week, headlined jointly by party Chairman Tom Perez and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, has gotten off to a rocky start. From the \u201cCome Together and Fight Back\u201d tour\u2019s kickoff rally in Maine on Monday, Democrats witnessed that old habits die hard. When the leader of the Maine Young Democrats asked the crowd what brought them to the rally, the audience erupted in \u201cBernie\u201d cheers. The leader followed up by asking, \u201cMaybe you came through because you are curious about the new DNC chairman and the future of Democratic politics?\u201d \u2014 and the crowd cut her off with boos. Things moved downhill quickly from there. During a joint interview with MSNBC\u2019s Chris Hayes on Tuesday night, Sanders said he does not even consider himself a Democrat. \u201cI am an independent,\u201d Sanders affirmed. The self-identified democratic socialist serves in the Senate as an independent, although he caucuses with the Democrats and ran in the Democratic presidential primary last election cycle. After his defeat in the primary, he endorsed Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton and campaigned for her. On Monday, Sanders kicked off the red-state tour with Perez, who narrowly defeated Sanders\u2019 preferred choice for the job, Rep. Keith Ellison of Minnesota. DNC chair on Georgia race: 'We have a lot of wind at our back' Perez and Sanders\u2019 differences were somewhat apparent in the Tuesday interview. On health care, Sanders called for a \u201cMedicare-for-all\u201d approach, and Perez stopped short of endorsing that policy while saying he believed health care should be a right. \u201cHealth care is absolutely a right in this country, or should be,\u201d Perez said. \u201cWe believe that as Democrats. Republicans don\u2019t appear to believe that.\u201d Sanders railed against \u201cthe ruling class\u201d and said voters needed to hear that. \u201cYour greed is destroying this country, and you know what? We\u2019re going to take you on,\u201d Sanders said. Asked about that kind of message, Perez demurred and said Democrats needed to campaign on \u201chope\u201d and later called it a \u201cfalse choice.\u201d \u201cWhen we put hope on the ballot, Chris, we win,\u201d Perez said. Dems look south to test anti-Trump strategy He went on to attack President Donald Trump\u2019s economic message. \u201cDonald Trump\u2019s vision for America is a vision for the top 1% of the 1%,\u201d Perez said. \u201cPart of what we have to do is expose the fraud of Donald Trump.\u201d Perez also raised eyebrows in earlier solo rallies, after he began including profanity as a new staple of his anti-Trump speech. The chairman now regularly uses a phrase that drew major attention at a stump speech in March: \u201cRepublicans don\u2019t give a s\u2014 about people.\u201d The crowd\u2019s reception was so positive, however, he now uses the phrase frequently enough that the DNC website sells T-shirts with a similar saying. The DNC plans to continue the remainder of the tour with a focus on \u201cshared values of inclusion and opportunity,\u201d a spokesperson said. \u201cAs Tom (Perez) and other DNC officers continue to travel the country, they will talk about how Donald Trump\u2019s first 100 days have shown us that he\u2019s not shaking things up, he\u2019s shaking American families down,\u201d DNC communications director Xochitl Hinojosa said. \u201cThe Democratic Party is on the side of working families and that\u2019s exactly what you\u2019ll continue to hear in the days to come.\u201d The party\u2019s tour continues this week with visits to red and purple states, including Arizona, Florida, Kentucky, Montana, Nebraska, Nevada and Utah.",

            "article_content": "Trump could engage North Korea, isolate it financially or attack it, analysts say Hoping for China's help didn't work with previous administrations, analyst says US President Donald Trump says he stands ready to fix the nuclear threat posed by North Korea \u2013 with or without China. Trump, who will meet with China\u2019s President at his Mar-A-Lago estate this week, declared Sunday that he would be willing to go it alone to restrain the secretive country\u2019s nuclear weapons program should Beijing fail to act. \u201cIf China is not going to solve North Korea, we will,\u201d Trump told the Financial Times in an interview. Trump didn\u2019t elaborate on exactly how he plans to stop North Korea leader Kim Jong Un from developing his arsenal. Some analysts have suggested his cryptic comments could simply be a way to unbalance Xi Jinping ahead of the landmark summit on Thursday and Friday this week. However, taking cooperation with China, North Korea\u2019s main ally and economic benefactor, out of the equation could lead to a much-needed change in dynamics with the provocative North Korean regime, said Anthony Ruggiero, a senior fellow at the Foundation for Defense of Democracies. \u201cWaiting for China to pressure North Korea didn\u2019t work for Bush, it didn\u2019t work for Obama and it won\u2019t work for Trump. We just don\u2019t have the same priorities,\u201d he said. To date, US policy has focused on multilateral efforts \u2013 six-country talks and United Nations sanctions \u2013 plus waiting out the Kim regime in a policy known as strategic patience. But all these have had little effect, with North Korea ramping up its missile and nuclear programs since 2016. So what might unilateral US action on North Korea look like? On at least three occasions on the campaign trail, Trump floated the radical approach of talking with Kim, potentially over a hamburger. \u201cI don\u2019t think a burger and fries is going to solve this one,\u201d said Lanhee Chan, a research fellow at the Hoover Institution. Why Trump should strike a deal with North Korea \u201cI don\u2019t think this is one of those things that can be solved overnight, and if there is to be diplomacy it\u2019s going to have to be take place over an extended period of time and is going to have to resolve some very, very tricky issues.\u201d Pyongyang has indicated it is open to negotiation but won\u2019t commit to complete denuclearization as a pre-condition for talks. It may be willing to suspend its nuclear and missile programs if Washington addresses its security concerns in return, said Leon Sigal, director of the Northeast Asia Cooperative Security Project at the Social Science Research Council in New York. \u201cThe only way out of Trump\u2019s predicament is acceptance \u2013 resume talks with North Korea, the sooner the better, to probe whether it is willing to suspend arming,\u201d Sigal wrote in an op-ed for CNN before Trump\u2019s latest pronouncements. Of course, this kind of strategy would be hugely risky, and the country\u2019s most recent provocations make any kind of US outreach difficult. After a lull in activity that coincided with Trump\u2019s election, North Korea launched a new type of missile as Trump met with Japan\u2019s leader Shinzo Abe on February 12. Since then, it has tested six missiles and conducted two rocket engine tests. The country\u2019s international standing has deteriorated further after the assassination of Kim\u2019s estranged half brother, Kim Jong Nam, with VX nerve agent at Kuala Lumpur International Airport. North Korea has denied any involvement. Ruggiero says the US needs to go after big Chinese banks and companies suspected of aiding North Korea more aggressively, citing the precedent of the financial penalties paid by European banks for dealing with Iran while US sanctions were in place. \u201cTrump needs to unleash the Treasury Department to investigate Chinese companies and banks, tell them it\u2019s not going to be allowed and fine them,\u201d said Ruggiero, who helped draft Iran legislation while working for Sen. Marco Rubio. On Friday, the Treasury sanctioned 11 North Koreans and one North Korean company for their links to the country\u2019s weapons program and violating UN sanctions \u2013 but Ruggiero said US authorities needed to focus their attention on China. Other analysts say sanctions, no matter how sophisticated, aren\u2019t going to bring the North Korean regime to its knees. \u201cThe bottom line is that the last thing they\u2019re going to cut is the military,\u201d said John Delury, an associate professor of Chinese studies at Yonsei University in South Korea. Peter Layton, a visiting fellow at the Griffith Asia Institute in Australia, says the US needs to convince China that it\u2019s actively keeping an unwanted regime alive by using forums like the G20 and UN to press this message. \u201cConvince the Chinese leadership that it is hurting itself by helping the DPRK. Keep publicly linking Kim Jong Un to Xi Jinping, try to associate them in the global public mind as much as possible,\u201d he said. Tillerson to warn China of sanctions over North Korea On his inaugural trip to Asia last month, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said the US would consider military action against North Korea if provoked. \u201cCertainly, we do not want things to get to a military conflict \u2026 but obviously, if North Korea takes actions that threaten the South Korean forces or our own forces, then that would be met with an appropriate response,\u201d he said. While the US possesses overwhelming firepower compared to North Korea, any American strike on North Korea could expose South Korea to devastating casualties, analysts say. \u201cEverything is doable, but it all boils down to what risks you are willing to take versus the outcome you hope to achieve,\u201d said Carl Schuster, a professor at Hawaii Pacific University and former director of operations at the US Pacific Command\u2019s Joint Intelligence Center. In a series of reports prepared in May 2016, the Texas-based geopolitical analysis group Stratfor said the US could assemble a force that could rain down more than 600 cruise missiles and smart bombs on North Korean targets in a pulverizing first strike. The weapons could be deployed with stealth B-2 bombers and F-22 Raptors, massive Ohio-class guided-missile submarines and a selection of cruisers and destroyers, it said. The problem, as Stratfor points out, is that Pyongyang has mobile launch vehicles that could then plausibly send a nuclear weapon toward South Korea or Japan \u2013 with unimaginable consequences. Trump does have some non-lethal military options that might not result in a North Korean counterstrike, according to Layton, who is also a former Royal Australian Air Force officer. He suggests a simple blockade of any ships leaving and entering North Korean waters. Another more risky option is to use US warships equipped with the Aegis anti-missile system to shoot down any future North Korean missile tests, Layton said. Covert raids by special forces in North Korea would be too risky and expose US troops to capture, experts said. Plus there are few signs of an elite or popular resistance ready to challenge the regime even if the US were able to decapitate it. \u201cRegime change is spy novel stuff,\u201d said Delury.

            "article_content": "\"It wasn't that Donald Trump won the election, it was that the Democratic Party lost the election,\" Sanders said The event was more of a progressive pep rally than a rehash of the 2016 campaign Bernie Sanders criticized Hillary Clinton\u2019s 2016 campaign in Boston Friday night at a progressive rally alongside Sen. Elizabeth Warren, saying the Democratic nominee\u2019s loss revealed the need for the \u201cfundamental restructuring of the Democratic Party.\u201d The Vermont senator also said some Democrats believe the voters who backed President Donald Trump are racists, xenophobes and \u201cdeplorables,\u201d a word Clinton famously used. \u201cI do not agree,\u201d he said. \u201cIt wasn\u2019t that Donald Trump won the election, it was that the Democratic Party lost the election,\u201d Sanders added. He ran through Democratic losses in recent years \u2013 checking off the Republican-controlled House, Senate, governor\u2019s offices and state legislatures \u2013 before saying that Republicans are \u201ca right-wing extremist party who has an agenda that most Americans soundly and roundly disagree with.\u201d \u201cHow in God\u2019s name do they win elections?\u201d Sanders said. \u201cAnd the reason is, in my view, that the time is long overdue for fundamental restructuring of the Democratic Party. We need a Democratic Party which is not the party of the liberal elite but a party of the working class of this country. \u201cWe need a party which is a grassroots party, a party where candidates are talking to working people \u2013 not spending their time raising money from the wealthy and the powerful.\u201d Sanders\u2019 comments came at a rally organized by his Our Revolution group, as well as several local left-wing organizations. Warren was not beside Sanders when he took the shots at Clinton\u2019s campaign and Democrats, and the Massachusetts senator and fellow 2020 Democratic prospect did not address those remarks onstage. But the event was meant to be much more of a progressive pep rally than a rehash of the 2016 campaign. Both Sanders and Warren touted proposals to make college affordable and to increase the minimum wage to $15 an hour. And both repeatedly lambasted Trump\u2019s presidency. Sanders also touted his \u201cMedicare-for-all\u201d health care proposal, which he said he will introduce as legislation within the next month. \u201cOn every major point facing this country, the American people do not believe in a right-wing agenda; they believe in a progressive agenda,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to take that agenda to the people.\u201d",

Democrats must reclaim the mantle of fairness and reengage rather than cut ties with the working-class voters who gravitated to Donald Trump in the last election, says one of the party\u2019s rising new leaders. \u201c(Trump) had this message about fairness and unfairness that should be the bread-and-butter of the Democratic Party,\u201d Pete Buttigieg told David Axelrod on \u201cThe Axe Files,\u201d a podcast from the University of Chicago Institute of Politics and CNN. \u201c(Democrats) had fairness as a theme kind of stolen from us, I think, with devastating effect.\u201d Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, recently ran unsuccessfully to chair the Democratic National Committee, but his performance on the national stage has elevated his stature within the party. When asked what advice he would give to Tom Perez, the new chairman of the DNC, Buttigieg, who has been calling for Democrats to expand their appeal beyond urban centers, recommended a sustained grassroots effort to reverse the party\u2019s weakened position in state legislatures and other local offices throughout the country. \u201cThe DNC is always vulnerable to this gravitational force that makes it treat the presidency like it\u2019s the only office that matters,\u201d Buttigieg said, adding that school board and state house elections can have profound policy implications and should be vigorously defended by the party. \u201cMy hope is that (Perez) will direct the party toward working from the bottom up,\u201d he said. Buttigieg, an openly gay, progressive Democrat who has found success in a red state, also expressed concern with what he views as a \u201cprofoundly self-defeating\u201d effort among activists from the liberal wing of the party to back primary challengers to Democratic lawmakers who cooperate with the President in any way. \u201cI think one of the big problems in Democratic politics is an ideology that\u2019s organized completely around Republican politics and ideology,\u201d Buttigieg said. \u201cAnd the only way we take somebody\u2019s measure is to evaluate how vigorously they oppose or how closely they imitate Republican policies.\u201d Buttigieg advised Democrats to embrace the diversity of perspective within the party, which he views as one of its core strengths, and instead focus on beating back Republican efforts in Congress. \u201cIf we want to win, we\u2019ve got to concentrate our efforts on the opposition \u2013 the real opposition \u2013 and that is congressional Republicans and this President that they enable,\u201d Buttigieg said.

The 30-year-old graphic designer is a lifelong liberal who grew up in a small, conservative town in southwestern Wisconsin. She\u2019s voted in every national election since she was able to, and considers herself an informed voter. \u201cI felt that Trump\u2019s win was the quintessential example of an unqualified man winning over an incredibly qualified woman,\u201d Leahy says.  \u201cAnd the idea that people I knew, that I was related to, voted for that man \u2026 it made me sick.\u201d While the result of the election infuriated her, it also sparked something much greater inside her. \u201cIt also made me realize that everyday involvement is key, and that I couldn\u2019t afford to sit around anymore sharing Facebook posts and avoiding real work,\u201d Leahy says. She attended the March on Washington and realized she was not alone in how she felt. That moment was the springboard for Leahy to engage in politics for the first time, in Wausau, Wisconsin. For Leahy, and many other women, it is an incredibly personal choice after the election, says Erin Forrest, executive director at Emerge Wisconsin. The group is part of Emerge America, founded in 2002 to identify female community leaders and train them to run for office. \u201cThis isn\u2019t just, \u2018I\u2019m going to get involved in my community,\u2019\u201d Forrest says of why women are flocking to the training. \u201cIt\u2019s watching the most qualified person, watching a woman get so close to becoming president, watching what she went through, and losing, to arguably the least qualified person to run for president. [It is] deeply personal.\u201d Clinton: \u2018Let us hope there is a wave of young women running for office\u2019 Clinton: Life hands all of us setbacks Leahy plans to run for a seat on the Marathon County Board, where she lives, and is just one of more than 400 women in the United States this year who Emerge America says are going through its six month, 70-hour training program. The group operates in 18 states and says 400 alumnae currently hold an elected office or are appointed to boards and commissions throughout the United States. In Wisconsin, of the 13 women who ran for office after attending the training, nine won. Charisse Daniels knows the importance of community. As an early childhood-community liaison she  trains professionals and advocates for Head Start, which promotes child development and education beginning at a young age. The election was an \u201cabsolute kick in the gut\u201d for the 29-year-old. \u201cI knew the world looked different when I walked out that door,\u201d the mother of four from Watertown, Wisconsin, recalls. \u201cThis isn\u2019t what I thought the world would look like. \u2026 It changed everything.\u201d Women's Marches around the world She marched in Madison, Wisconsin, and realized she cared about the same things her Republican neighbors care about: manufacturing jobs disappearing, wages stagnating, communities like Watertown disappearing. \u201cWe care about the same issues,\u201d Daniels says. \u201cWe can fix them together.\u201d So she made a decision. She\u2019d like to run for mayor of Watertown. Daniels knows it\u2019s an uphill climb as a young woman of color in a conservative district. This isn\u2019t what I thought the world would look like. Charisse Daniels, on the United States after the election When Daniels shows up for a workshop on a frigid day in Madison, she is attentive and engaged throughout the class. But she learns a tough lesson while practicing door-knock drills to prepare her for canvassing for votes in her mayoral run. The \u201cactor\u201d she meets plays an angry Republican, who is disgusted at the tax rate and blames it on Democrats. Daniels is unsure what to say. She\u2019s unsuccessful at dealing with the actor. It has taught her some people can\u2019t be swayed, and as a candidate she should focus on those who connect with her ideas. Some of those crossover issues, she believes, would be tackling Watertown\u2019s opiate addiction problem and funding STEM programs for children. Even if Daniels fails to win public office, she\u2019s determined to try. Petra DeJesus, 60, is one of the older women in the Emerge Los Angeles workshop. DeJesus is an attorney, with extensive experience working for the San Francisco Public Defender\u2019s Office. She has worked in rural legal defense and currently works as a public interest attorney for workers exposed to asbestos. She joined the San Francisco Police Commission when it expanded to include citizens because she felt the commission didn\u2019t represent the Latino perspective. But it wasn\u2019t until Donald Trump became President that she was fearful of the future of her country and inspired to run for higher office. \u201c[I was] scared, scared for the future and wondering what can I do,\u201d DeJesus says. \u201cCan I get more involved? Who can I support? And then I realized, why not me? Why not me? I know what I want and what my community wants \u2026 so I need to do something more.\u201d It\u2019s not breaking into the old boys\u2019 club, it\u2019s creating the new girls\u2019 club. Erin Forrest, executive director of Emerge Wisconsin DeJesus\u2019 only experience running for local office was running for a spot on the San Francisco County Central Committee, a local county board. \u201cI was flying by the seat of my pants,\u201d she says of the experience. So she signed up for Emerge California to learn more about how to prepare and effectively run for a statewide or national office. After watching Trump win, DeJesus refuses to be a woman sitting on the local sidelines anymore. Emerge America hopes many more women do the same. \u201cWomen are more than half the population and only a quarter of elected officials. That\u2019s a problem,\u201d says Emerge\u2019s Forrest. \u201cIt\u2019s not breaking into the old boys\u2019 club, it\u2019s creating the new girls\u2019 club.",

            "article_content": "Perez was welcomed into his new job on Saturday by jeering progressive activists But while Democrats clawed at each other the festivities at CPAC were beginning to wind down If Hillary Clinton had won the presidency last year, Tom Perez, the freshly elected Democratic National Committee chair, might well be entering his second month running her Justice Department. Instead, Perez was welcomed into his new job on Saturday by jeering progressive activists, who for the second time in a year, saw their preferred pick to lead the party defeated after a protracted and unexpectedly feisty campaign. Supporters of Minnesota Rep. Keith Ellison, the choice of Sen. Bernie Sanders, painted Perez\u2019s election as another victory for an establishment they blame for ceding the White House to Donald Trump by alienating young and working class voters. Ellison supporters yelling over Brazile, chanting \"Not big money, party for the people\" pic.twitter.com/Z9Mh8VIWnr Minutes after the results were announced \u2013 Perez prevailed on a second ballot after falling one vote short on the first \u2013 the co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee, Adam Green, a vocal Ellison backer, leaned back and ruminated on the contentious scene. \u201cThis was not an ideological battle between a corporate Democrat and a progressive,\u201d he said, noting that Perez too would have been his choice for attorney general in a Clinton administration. \u201cWe agree with him on policy and thought he would challenge big corporations like he did as (President Barack Obama\u2019s) labor secretary.\u201d Progressives riled up after DNC vote The problem, Green suggested, was that Perez did not \u2013 at least not yet \u2013 have \u201chis finger on the pulse of progressive resistance\u201d to the new administration. Across the ballroom, one young and frustrated Ellison supporter, Alexa Vaca, put it simply: \u201cThis shows that the Democratic Party didn\u2019t learn their lesson.\u201d While Democrats clawed at each other in Atlanta, the festivities at the Conservative Political Action Conference in National Harbor, Maryland, were beginning to wind down. Over the previous 48 hours, the annual conservative gathering had welcomed its first sitting Republican president in his first year in office since Ronald Reagan. \u201cI wouldn\u2019t miss a chance to talk to my friends,\u201d Trump said between roars of approval during his Friday address. \u201cThese are my friends.  And we\u2019ll see you again next year and the year after that, and I\u2019ll be doing this with CPAC whenever I can, and I\u2019ll make sure that we\u2019re here a lot.\u201d A year before, Trump skipped the conference, backing out the day before his scheduled appearance. The American Conservative Union, which organizes the gathering, bit back in response, saying Trump\u2019s decision \u201ccomes at a critical time in our movement\u2019s history. His decision sends a clear message to grassroots conservatives.\u201d That was then. Now, Trump is in the White House and supporters wearing his signature red hats dotted the conference\u2019s halls and ballrooms. Asked if they considered the President a true conservative, attendees who affirmed his credentials \u2013 as eager to vouch for Trump as anti-Perez Democrats had been to highlight where the party\u2019s establishment had failed them \u2013 employed an assortment of rhetorical contortions. \u201cI think that Trump is a different type of conservative than, perhaps, the mainstream conservative, and I think that\u2019s why he got so far in the primaries,\u201d said Wesley Dalton, a student at Brigham Young University in Utah. Matt Batzel, the national executive director of American Majority, a conservative organization that trains grassroots activists, described Trump as a \u201cPatriotic Conservative\u201d before grinning and confessing, \u201cI just made up that term.\u201d Even what remained of the GOP\u2019s dedicated libertarian wing, which had been transformed by the rise of Trumpism from an ascendant force to a CPAC afterthought, sought to parlay the presidential moment by passing out caps that read, \u201cMake Taxation Theft Again.\u201d \u201cPeople don\u2019t notice it as much here, because if we wear it around they just assume it\u2019s the (Make America Great Again) hat,\u201d said Zach Garretson, donor relations officer for the libertarian Stonegait Institute, \u201cbut when we\u2019re not at an event like this and you wear that hat, people will look at it and be like, \u2018Oh! What does that say?\u2019\u201d Instagram post not found. Post has been removed or is no longer public. Conservatives\u2019 willingness to look beyond their unlikely standard-bearer\u2019s ideological inconsistencies have been rewarded in the early running. They routinely made glowing reference to the nomination of Neil Gorsuch to be a Supreme Court justice \u2013 proof, many insisted, that Trump, whatever he actually believed, was firmly on track to govern like they hoped. Matt Schlapp, chairman of the American Conservative Union, praised Trump\u2019s \u201cconservative instincts\u201d and applauded his Cabinet choices. He also welcomed top White House strategist Steve Bannon, who had for years been persona non grata at the venue, onstage for a discussion along with White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus. \u201cI want to thank you for finally inviting me to CPAC,\u201d Bannon said at the outset. The former Breitbart boss had previously hosted \u201cThe Uninvited,\u201d a parallel gathering for fellow out-of-favor right-wingers. \u201cI know there are many alumni out here in the audience.\u201d Schlapp nodded to the awkward moment, then declared: \u201cHere\u2019s what we decided to do at CPAC with the uninvited. We decided to say that everybody\u2019s a part of our conservative family.\u201d And with that, they were off. Bannon railed against the media \u2013 \u201cthe opposition party\u201d \u2013 and drew cheers as he outlined plans for the \u201cdeconstruction of the administrative state.\u201d More applause interrupted his description of Trump\u2019s decision to withdraw the US from Trans-Pacific Partnership negotiations, calling it \u201cone of the most pivotal moments in modern American history.\u201d For observers of a party and movement that has traditionally embraced free trade, the scene was instructive. Not a year ago, the idea of a Republican administration\u2019s scuttling of a massive free trade pact (and promise to take apart or narrow other existing deals) being met with rapturous ovations might have seemed absurd. Republican opposition to free trade agreements increased dramatically in the past year https://t.co/Z5PU96oQh1 pic.twitter.com/A3w0MAqtIs But the presidency has a certain affect on people and political parties. With Barack Obama in the White House and Hilary Clinton, it seemed, poised to follow him, Democrats enjoyed nearly a decade of relative peace. On the eve of the election, as progressives put the finishing touches on strategies for nudging the new administration to the left, many confided that, for all the tumult of the primary, they fully expected the Clinton administration to offer them a seat at the table. Perez and Ellison jointly addressing press now. pic.twitter.com/OSm2gDuYEU Nearly four months since those best laid plans went stunningly awry, Democrats have finally wrapped up a long leadership campaign \u2013 between two front-runners with nearly indistinguishable political profiles \u2013 with their own activist coalition in an uproar, rallying against Trump but also openly organizing and agitating for primary challenges to the party\u2019s depleted House and Senate caucuses. At CPAC on Saturday, the results of its annual survey ran in stark contrast to the scenes in Atlanta. Eight in 10 of those polled agreed that Trump was \u201crealigning the conservative movement\u201d \u2013 and 86% approved of the job he has done since taking office in January. \u201cI love this place,\u201d Trump said at the top of his speech a day before. \u201cLove you people.\u201d And they loved the President right back. For Democrats, down in Atlanta, that kind of affection seemed a long way off.",

            "article_content": "Sen. Chris Coons, who grew up as a Republican, has offered a measured tone toward the President His role on the Judiciary Committee makes him important to the nomination of Neil Gorsuch Amid an often blistering season on Capitol Hill \u2013 where senators have lobbed unprecedented insults at each other and tangled publicly with the administration \u2013 Democratic Sen. Chris Coons of Delaware appears to be among the few trying to lower the temperature in the chamber. And the White House appears to have noticed. Coons was the only Democrat from a solidly blue state invited to a meeting between President Donald Trump and eight other senators last week. Republicans have 52 seats in the Senate and would need eight more votes to avoid a filibuster on key issues such as the confirmation of Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch \u2014 making every Democratic vote potentially significant. Coons, who sits on the Senate Judiciary Committee, has refused to go as far as some of his Democratic colleagues and call for a filibuster of Trump\u2019s Supreme Court nominee, saying he wants to move forward \u201cone step at a time\u201d and first hold a hearing and committee vote before deciding any further action. That doesn\u2019t mean he\u2019s completely ruled out a filibuster, however. Coons meets with Gorsuch on Tuesday, and he intends to press him on a number of issues, including how Gorsuch would handle further attacks on the judiciary by the President. He\u2019s hoping Gorsuch will go beyond comments he made to Sen. Richard Blumenthal, a Connecticut Democrat, who said the nominee called Trump\u2019s criticism \u201cdisheartening\u201d and \u201cdemoralizing.\u201d \u201cWe are going to have a constitutional crisis if this President continues in the direction he\u2019s headed,\u201d Coons told CNN in an interview. \u201cThree weeks as President and this is one of those red lines.\u201d Coons said \u201cjudicial independence\u201d is fundamental for constitutional order. \u201cAnd if Judge Gorsuch doesn\u2019t get that, he doesn\u2019t belong on the court.\u201d Still, while some progressives are calling for Democrats to do whatever they can to stall or block Trump\u2019s nominees \u2014especially after Republicans blocked President Barack Obama\u2019s Supreme Court nomination last year \u2014 Coons has been hesitant to commit to similar stonewalling. He said it was \u201coutrageous\u201d that Republicans refused to give Merrick Garland a hearing last year and that it\u2019s \u201conly human to want some revenge,\u201d but Democrats need to challenge themselves not \u201cto act in a petty way.\u201d \u201cIf all we do is continue to exact a pound of flesh from each other, we will eventually strip our republic bare to the bone,\u201d Coons told reporters recently. CNN has reached out to the White House for comment on their relationship with Coons but hasn\u2019t yet gotten a response. Coons is keenly aware of the reality that Democrats aren\u2019t in control. \u201cWe don\u2019t run the Senate. They can have hearings for Judge Gorusch without us\u2013whether we like it or not,\u201d he told CNN. \u201cThe reality is he\u2019s going to get a hearing on the judiciary committee. The challenge is will we fully participate? The more narrow point is: Am I keeping an open mind?\u201d Coons\u2019 name has popped up a few times in recent months in association with Trump. Along with the White House meeting last week, Coons appeared with Trump at the National Prayer Breakfast earlier this month, and made a visit to Trump Tower back in December. The incident raised eyebrows since Coons hails from a blue state where Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton clobbered Trump, 53%-42%. He\u2019s also not up for re-election until 2020, so he\u2019s not under as much pressure as some other Democrats who are defending their seats next year, especially those from red states that Trump won. But his recent sightings with Trump don\u2019t necessarily suggest the two are striking up a bromance. Coons was the co-chair of the National Prayer Breakfast, so naturally the two would be seen together at the event. As for his visit to Trump Tower? That was made to formally invite Trump to the breakfast. The two also traveled to Dover Air Force Base together for the return of the remains of the US service member killed in the raid in Yemen, a relatively common practice for Delaware dignitaries. In fact, there\u2019s plenty of evidence of Coons being critical of Trump, especially during the presidential campaign but also since Trump\u2019s inauguration. Coons once called Trump \u201ca thin-skinned reality TV star\u201d and \u201ca Cheeto-faced short-fingered vulgarian,\u201d according to reports. (He later expressed regret over the comment.) Coons has so far opposed six of Trump\u2019s Cabinet nominees \u2013 Steve Mnuchin, Betsy DeVos, Jeff Sessions, Tom Price, Nikki Haley and Mike Pompeo \u2013 and approved three of them\u2013John Kelly, Elaine Chao and James Mattis. He did not vote on Rex Tillerson for secretary of state because he was on the trip to Dover with Trump during the full Senate vote. And while he told MSNBC that he was considering voting for Tillerson out of concern for whom Trump might pick should Tillerson fail confirmation, he ultimately voted against the former ExxonMobil CEO in the Senate Foreign Relations Committee vote. Nonetheless, Coons has been adamant that he\u2019s willing to work with the other side. \u201cI think the only way we have any hope of getting back to a functioning Senate is if we follow the rules and traditions of the Senate,\u201d he said. Coons\u2019 outlook may be influenced by home state values. Shortly after every Election Day, Delaware has a state holiday called \u201cReturn Day,\u201d where people gather in Sussex County to announce and celebrate election results. The tradition dates back as far as 1792. Candidates, both winners and losers, ride together in a parade of horse-drawn carriages and antique cars, then opponents pair up to bury a hatchet in a box of sand. Coons did so in 2010 with his Republican Senate rival, tea party favorite Christine O\u2019Donnell, creating a rather surprising photo opp at the end of a bruising political year. \u201cI\u2019ve grown up going to that for decades and it\u2019s an important part of our state\u2019s culture,\u201d Coons told CNN. \u201cWe talk about something called the Delaware way, which is how we manage to work together across the aisle.\u201d That same spirit of bipartisanship was also on display when Delaware\u2019s new Democratic Gov. John Carney brought his gubernatorial rival as his guest to Trump\u2019s inauguration. And Coons invited Trump\u2019s Delaware campaign chair, Rob Arlett, to the National Prayer Breakfast as his guest. The two men, despite their wildly different political views, say they have a mutual respect for each other, in part because their sons are both high school wrestlers in the same weight class for opposing schools. Speaking to CNN, Arlett recalled what he considered a remarkable exchange with the senator at an event on Return Day, when Coons came up to Arlett and shook his hand to congratulate him on Trump\u2019s win. Coons added that he went onto Trump\u2019s website and found three items among Trump\u2019s goals for the first 100 days that the senator felt he could start working on with the administration. They involved veterans, infrastructure and manufacturing. \u201cThat was the first conversation that he and I had after the election,\u201d Arlett said. \u201cA handshake and an agreement that we have to work together.\u201d Coons grew up as a Republican in a conservative family and volunteered for Ronald Reagan\u2019s presidential campaign in 1980. He became a Democrat in college, but he said his background helped him better understand the other side. \u201cWhen I walk into a room with a Republican senator, I don\u2019t walk in assuming that they are mean spirited or wrong headed. I think \u2018Oh, you know, this person has the view of this uncle or that cousin,\u2019\u201d he said. \u201cI think that helps.\u201d Sen. Johnny Isakson, a Republican from Georgia, has worked with Coons on a number of committees as well as legislation and praised his Democratic colleague to CNN Monday. The two formed a friendship not only through legislating but also at the weekly prayer breakfast in the Capitol, according to Isakson, who added that they\u2019ve \u201cbecome best of friends.\u201d \u201cHe legitimately tries to find common ground,\u201d he said. \u201cThe last question he asks is what party are you from, not the first question.\u201d Sen. Bob Corker, a Republican who chairs the Senate Foreign Relations committee on which Coons serves, has also worked with the senator on legislation. He painted Coons as \u201copen minded\u201d and \u201cincredibly diligent,\u201d though he doesn\u2019t agree with him on everything. While Coons described the President as \u201calarmingly ungrounded in the traditions of our Constitutional system,\u201d he said he\u2019s determined to work with his colleagues to restore what he sees as a sense of order, even if it can feel instinctual to do the opposite during such highly-charged, emotional times. \u201cI think the role of the Senate is more important than ever,\u201d he said. CNN\u2019s Brooke Brower contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Gobsmacked by their base\u2019s ferocious rejection of Donald Trump\u2019s presidency, the candidates to chair the Democratic Party scrambled Saturday to show how devoted they are to the cause. Former Labor Secretary Tom Perez bragged to the Democratic National Committee\u2019s \u201cfuture forum\u201d about racing to airport protests in Houston and then San Francisco. Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, made sure everyone knew he was the only one to skip David Brock\u2019s donor summit to participate in the Women\u2019s March in Washington. Put him in charge, Minnesota Rep. Keith Ellison pledged, and \u201cWe will be asking Democrats all over the country, \u2018Bring coffee to the marches. Be in the marches yourself. Carry a sign.\u2019 \u201c As for those white rural and exurban voters who so brutally rejected Democrats in November \u2013 well, bringing them back into the fold is also a priority for those vying to lead the party. If the base allows it. After three weeks of anti-Trump protests, Democrats are still stunned by the sudden burst of energy. The party\u2019s organs are all racing to keep up as dozens of events pop up \u2013 often on Facebook, without any party chapter or progressive organization\u2019s involvement at all \u2013 each weekend. \u201cThe activism of people who are concerned about the Trump administration\u2019s threat to the country is very energizing to us,\u201d said US Sen. Tim Kaine of Virginia, the 2016 Democratic vice presidential nominee and one of the swing-state senators up for re-election in 2018. \u201cWe don\u2019t view that as threatening \u2013 we love the energy.\u201d The energy, though, is all rooted in ferocious opposition to Trump \u2013 the same strategy that failed Hillary Clinton in 2016. That reality has some Democrats on Capitol Hill fretting that the rising anti-Trump fervor is putting the party at risk of papering over the same problems with voters in rural and exurban America they woke up with on November 9. \u201cIf you can\u2019t get them back to where they\u2019re looking and thinking, \u2018The Democratic Party still represents me,\u2019 then you\u2019ll always be in the minority,\u201d said US Sen. Joe Manchin, D-West Virginia. \u201cThe anger that people feel is righteous and justified, but it can\u2019t just be a party against Mr. Trump,\u201d said US Sen. Mark Warner, D-Virginia. \u201cI understand the righteous anger against some of the President\u2019s policies, but we also need to lay out a narrative that\u2019s more than just a series of position papers \u2013 that gives us an overarching theme,\u201d Warner said. \u201cAnd that\u2019s what I\u2019m looking for.\u201d Manchin and nine other Senate Democrats are up for re-election in 2018 in states that Trump won. Four of those Democrats \u2013 Indiana\u2019s Joe Donnelly, Missouri\u2019s Claire McCaskill, North Dakota\u2019s Heidi Heitkamp and Montana\u2019s Jon Tester \u2013 are in states where Trump crushed Clinton. Just how much latitude those senators need \u2013 and should be given by the base on votes like Cabinet and Supreme Court confirmations \u2013 is the challenge confronting Democrats now, as the party frantically searches for ways to protect those red-state Democrats without jeopardizing the base\u2019s energy and enthusiasm. Meanwhile, much of the base is demanding total opposition to Trump \u2013 no matter the political costs for Democrats in red states. And there are no sacred cows, as US Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Massachusetts, learned when she voted in committee to confirm Ben Carson for Housing and Urban Development secretary. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer, D-New York, was the target of protective protesters who recently marched to his home, chanting an expletive that rhymed with his first name. These progressives see the party\u2019s future in energizing women, minorities and young people in cities and suburbs \u2013 particularly in Sun Belt states, including Georgia and Arizona. \u201cThose working-class white voters aren\u2019t the future of the party,\u201d said Markos Moulitsas, the founder of the liberal blog DailyKos.com, which has already raised $400,000 for a Democratic candidate in the expected runoff for the US House seat in Georgia soon to be vacated by Tom Price, Trump\u2019s nominee for Health and Human Services secretary. \u201cMost of them are stuck in fake-news land anyway, and no amount of reality will penetrate that bubble. They think 1.5 million people attended Trump\u2019s inauguration. They think Obama only needed 50 votes to pass his Supreme Court nominees,\u201d Moulitsas said. \u201cThey\u2019re lost. It\u2019s a waste of time to try and win them back when there are so many core-Democratic-base who didn\u2019t register or vote last cycle. Almost half the country didn\u2019t vote, and the bulk of the non-voters were liberal-leaning people many of them now marching in the streets. \u201cSo instead of trying to chase people trapped by Breitbart and its cohorts in conservative media, give them a reason to get excited about rallying around Democrats,\u201d he said. Democrats\u2019 short-term fate, though, rests in part on whether the party can hold onto Senate seats in Trump states. In those areas, senators are struggling to wrap their minds around the alternate universes of the Trump presidency so far. In one \u2013 where the women\u2019s marches, airport protests and pro-Obamacare town hall turnout are the dominant storylines and former alt-right Breitbart news executive Steve Bannon is seen as a shadow president \u2013 Trump has walked himself into repeated controversies and revealed himself to be just what the Clinton campaign warned he was. In another \u2013 where rural and exurban voters with little economic opportunity sought to send someone to shake up a political world they thought had lost touch with their needs \u2013 Trump has pulled out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, jumpstarted the Keystone pipeline, taken steps toward renegotiating other trade deals, hosted top labor union leaders at the White House and is fulfilling some of his top campaign promises. \u201cYou folks have been terrific to me,\u201d Trump told union representatives as they joined Harley-Davidson executives in a recent meeting at the White House. \u201cSometimes your top people didn\u2019t support me but the steelworkers supported me.\u201d Many left-leaning organizations are still trying to feel their ways around the new White House. \u201cIt\u2019s like \u2018Game of Thrones\u2019 right now in the Trump administration \u2013 it\u2019s kind of hard to tell who\u2019s going to come out on top,\u201d said Thea Lee, the AFL-CIO\u2019s deputy chief of staff. US Rep. Debbie Dingell, a Michigan Democrat who represents many of those \u201cdownriver\u201d voters, said she is focused on how to use language that makes clear that \u201cI am inclusive of everybody, but I\u2019m also fighting for those UAW workers who think we\u2019ve forgotten them, or those Teamsters whose pensions are being threatened to be cut.\u201d Dingell added: \u201cThose are our constituents who we have to be a voice for, too. We\u2019ve got to find a way to talk about it so they know we are the fighters for them and that we will stand strong, and that we care about those issues.\u201d Increasingly, Democrats are moving toward a message styled after populist stalwarts such as Warren, Bernie Sanders and US Sen. Sherrod Brown of Ohio. Their case: The problem wasn\u2019t Trump\u2019s promises, or what his campaign represented \u2013 it\u2019s that in office, he\u2019s promoting his billionaire friends and failing to take care of those who carried him to the presidency. US Sen. Debbie Stabenow of Michigan, another Democrat up for re-election in 2018, said 9,000 people turned out in January at a pro-Obamacare rally in Macomb County \u2013 a key swing region that helped tip Michigan for Trump. \u201cThere were people that I know that attended that supported President Trump that didn\u2019t really believe he was going to take away their health care or cut their Medicare,\u201d she said. \u201cPeople thought they were voting for change, and now are saying, \u2018Wait a minute, I didn\u2019t mean that.\u2019 \u201cI\u2019m still fighting for the same people in Michigan that want a shot to stay in the middle class,\u201d Stabenow said. \u201cI think this is really more about (communicating) that.\u201d Other Democrats made a similar argument \u2013 saying the activist energy is increasingly pushing them toward populist policies. US Rep. Cheri Bustos, an Illinois Democrat who easily won in a district Trump carried, said the party\u2019s problems can be addressed partially through simple moves such as \u201csupermarket Saturdays,\u201d job-shadowing blue-collar workers and sitting through lengthy appearances on rural radio stations. \u201cWe\u2019ve also got to make sure that we\u2019re disciplined about what our values are. We know that our policies resonate with people \u2013 with these folks who want to try Trump,\u201d she said. \u201cOur theory right now is that they\u2019re going to have buyer\u2019s remorse \u2013 that they tried him because they wanted something different; they were tired of the status quo; they felt left behind by this wage stagnation,\u201d Bustos said. \u201cWe have the right policies to address that. But we haven\u2019t always gone deep into the kind of districts where people have felt left behind.\u201d A particular cause of heartburn for red-state Democratic senators is the upcoming confirmation battle over Trump\u2019s Supreme Court nominee, Neil Gorsuch. It was, after all, the expectation that Trump would appoint conservative justices \u2013 whose tenures would long outlast his presidency \u2013 that kept many moderate Republicans behind his candidacy. It\u2019s a conundrum: Do Democrats risk undercutting their own cause by waging war over Trump\u2019s most conventional decision yet? So Senate Democrats are slow-walking their way around Gorsuch, promising to give him due consideration \u2013 buying themselves more time to figure out whether they have 41 out of 48 Democratic votes necessary to block him, and whether it\u2019s even the fight they want. \u201cExplaining anything having to do with courts or law is a challenge \u2013 not because it\u2019s inconsequential but because it can\u2019t be dramatized with a picture and a face and a voice,\u201d said US Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Connecticut. \u201cSo we need to make sure the American people understand what\u2019s at stake,\u201d Blumenthal said. \u201cThe gobbledygook and the legal jargon are very confusing. And just now as I\u2019m talking to you, I\u2019m realizing that I\u2019m sort of going off into the ether.\u201d Moulitsas said red-state Democrats should forget using those votes to try to prove themselves as moderates. The likes of Donnelly and Heitkamp \u201caren\u2019t going to win re-election on the strength of Trump voters impressed by their confirmation votes,\u201d he said. \u201cThe best chance they have to win in their tough states will be by riding this incredible wave of energy. It may not be enough, but pissing off the base certainly isn\u2019t the better bet. You either ride in with the people who brought you, or go down fighting honorably,\u201d Moulitsas said. \u201cPretending to be a \u2018Republican, but a little less bad\u2019 has never inspired a dramatic re-election victory.\u201d",

            "article_content": "For Bernie Sanders fans, the Democratic National Committee isn't viewed as an honest broker Even the contenders for chair acknowledge that the DNC must re-establish its credibility As Democrats choose their next national party leader, the candidates vying for the job acknowledge one thing awaits the winner: A major credibility problem. These Democrats aren't attending Trump's inauguration The still-lingering tensions of the 2016 primary have dominated the contest so far to head the Democratic National Committee. But they have also masked the deeper problem: After a year of debate scheduling drama, hacked emails, questions about impartiality and former Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz\u2019s convention-eve resignation, many Democrats aren\u2019t convinced the DNC is even capable of playing a central role in the party\u2019s Donald Trump-era resistance. For backers of Bernie Sanders, the DNC isn\u2019t viewed as an honest broker. And on Hillary Clinton\u2019s side, the organization is seen as so beset by controversy that it might be more trouble than it\u2019s worth. Evidence of Democrats\u2019 distrust is already evident: Sanders has so far declined to share his massive fundraising list with the DNC, and former attorney general Eric Holder is heading a major new Democratic redistricting initiative, separate from the DNC. Within the race for DNC chair, Minnesota Rep. Keith Ellison, Labor Secretary Tom Perez and five other candidates broadly agree that the party needs to invest deeply in state parties and in working-class America, that it needs new efforts toward protecting voting access and that the next chair must be a more successful fundraiser. First, though, even the contenders for chair acknowledge that the DNC must re-establish its credibility. \u201cListen, the DNC is now a weaker organization coming out of this election than it was going into it,\u201d Jaime Harrison, the South Carolina Democratic chairman and one of the seven candidates to helm the DNC, said Saturday in an interview with CNN at the first of four \u201cfuture forums\u201d the party is holding. \u201cThe question is how do you get it back on track? We\u2019re in the ditch \u2013 how do we get it out of the ditch and then back on the road?\u201d Harrison said. \u201cI can understand the hesitation on people\u2019s parts and the hand-wringing that is going on \u2013 because all of the things that took place in this past election were just really hard, and the hits just didn\u2019t stop.\u201d The candidates for DNC chair have largely rejected the characterization of the race as a Sanders vs. Clinton proxy battle \u2013 in part because Ellison doesn\u2019t want his support limited to Sanders supporters and Perez knows he can\u2019t win without some backing from the party\u2019s ascendant progressives. Trump's team already trying to break Senate Supreme Court filibuster But those tensions are evident in the race: Sanders has not committed to sharing his massive fundraising list with the DNC \u2013 saying he wants to make sure it isn\u2019t diluted through use to bolster candidates that don\u2019t meet his progressive standards. That lack of a show of faith has angered many Democrats and threatens to hobble Ellison, who Sanders has endorsed. Perez, meanwhile, has aligned himself closely with President Barack Obama \u2013 but his core argument for the job is that he can address the problems that languished during the Obama years. \u201cThe task ahead is the task of being a fixer-upper-in-chief, and I\u2019ve prided myself on being the turnaround guy in the work that I\u2019ve done,\u201d Perez said. He has offered a series of technical fixes \u2013 starting with a unit dedicating to protecting voting access \u2013 and says he could restore the party\u2019s lagging morale. \u201cWhen people don\u2019t have a hop in their step when they get out of bed in the morning,\u201d he said, \u201cthey\u2019re not as productive.\u201d Perez said Democrats need an \u201chonest broker\u201d who runs a \u201ctransparent ship\u201d and is \u201cnever in fact or in perception putting their thumb on the scales\u201d in primaries, he said, to rebuild party loyalists\u2019 faith in the DNC as its central institution. \u201cWe have to earn it. We have to show people that we can do it,\u201d he said. Ellison, meanwhile, rejected the importance of helming the DNC as a nuts-and-bolts fix-it job. \u201cThe top priority\u2019s not a nuts-and-bolts thing. And I know reporters and Washington political types \u2013 they just want to go to the nuts and bolts. But the most important thing is attitudinal,\u201d Ellison said. \u201cWe didn\u2019t arrive where we are because we got nuts and bolts wrong. Nuts and bolts flow from core motivation and purpose,\u201d he said. \u201cIf you get purpose right, everything tends to flow in the right direction after that. It\u2019s amazing how easy things become after you get the purpose right.\u201d Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, entered the race late and is basing his candidacy on the rejection of a second Sanders-against-Clinton battle \u2013 and on the argument that as a local official, he could shift the party\u2019s focus away from Washington. \u201cOne of the things you could sense in the crowd, right, amongst the DNC members, is they don\u2019t feel connected to the mother ship,\u201d he said. Buttigieg said that for the next DNC chair, \u201cthe fundraising role is huge,\u201d and that \u201cwe need the buy-in and the investment from Democrats in every part of the country.\u201d But, he said, the DNC is an organization badly in need of a new chief executive. \u201cWe don\u2019t seem to have any kind of strategic plan \u2013 we just go from one cycle to the next,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to just do the bread-and-butter, how do you run the organization right, before we can really get into any of the spiffy innovation things that I want to do.\u201d Democrats already are trying to get out the vote for 2020 Ray Buckley \u2013 a long-time New Hampshire Democratic chair, floated the idea of \u201cco-chairs\u201d leading the DNC \u2013 with one focused on presenting the party\u2019s message on TV and the other handling the internal, technical challenges. That idea didn\u2019t gain traction, so he entered the race himself. Buckley said the party\u2019s handling of the 2016 race was deeply flawed. \u201cThe very first thing I\u2019d do is address the issues that came to light in the nominating process: the neutrality of the chair and the staff; superdelegates; the joint fundraising agreement; how the caucuses are just so wildly different from one state to another and there\u2019s no support; and the debate schedule,\u201d he said. \u201cNone of that had to happen,\u201d Buckley said. \u201cNone of it.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Democrats hold their first of four forums to select a new chair Rep. Keith Ellison and Labor Secretary Tom Perez are leading contenders Over and over, the candidates to helm the Democratic National Committee stressed Saturday that they\u2019re waging a new fight against Donald Trump \u2013 not re-fighting the old one between Bernie Sanders and Hillary Clinton. Their race is no proxy battle, and the party is now unified around the cause of stopping Trump as he prepares to take the oath of office, the seven contenders said. Now, they are asking the party to decide the type of resume and experience that can lift the party from 2016\u2019s wreckage. There\u2019s the grassroots progressive organizer, Rep. Keith Ellison of Minnesota. There\u2019s the nuts-and-bolts \u201cturnaround artist,\u201d Labor Secretary Tom Perez. Then there\u2019s Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, who proudly boasts that \u2013 unlike Ellison, who endorsed Sanders in the Democratic primary, and Perez, who was close to Clinton \u2013 he had nothing to do with the 2016 race. They and four other candidates to become the next Democratic National Committee chair officially kicked off the race with a forum here Saturday. They are competing to lead an organization beset by accusations \u2013 based largely on a limited debate schedule and stolen emails published by WikiLeaks \u2013 that the DNC improperly put its thumb on the scales in the 2016 contest between Hillary Clinton and Sen. Bernie Sanders. Each offered plans to ease lingering tensions. Ellison said he\u2019d hold at least one monthly chair\u2019s call with DNC members, at least one monthly regional call and at least one monthly live-streamed event connecting the party\u2019s chair with its grass roots. Perez promised to invest in and empower state-level Democratic parties, saying he would help them \u201ctake Howard Dean to scale\u201d \u2013 referring to the \u201c50-state strategy\u201d coined by the last winner of a wide-open DNC chair\u2019s race. \u201cI believe the DNC needs a fresh start, too, and I believe that I can deliver that fresh start,\u201d Buttigieg said. The Phoenix gathering was the first of four \u201cfuture forums\u201d Democrats are holding ahead of their election of a new national chair in Atlanta in February. The race is wide open, though Ellison and Perez boast the most support from big-name party figures. All seven candidates greeted steady streams of DNC voting members, with about one in eight of the 437 who will select the next chair in attendance Saturday. For 90 minutes, the seven candidates pitched their own resumes \u2013 but beyond approving head-nods, all but ignored each other. All agreed that Democrats need to face Trump with a united front. And that the party must make voting access a foremost priority. And that Dean\u2019s \u201c50-state strategy,\u201d launched in 2005, is a model to which the party must return. Mostly, they stressed that \u2013 despite Ellison\u2019s early endorsement from Sanders and support from many Sanders-aligned progressive groups, and Perez\u2019s close ties to both Hillary Clinton and President Barack Obama \u2013 the DNC race isn\u2019t a proxy for Sanders vs. Clinton, round two. \u201cYou know, people ask me, \u2018Are you a Clinton Democrat or a Bernie Democrat?\u2019 Guys, I grew up in South Carolina and all I\u2019ve ever been is a Democrat,\u201d said Jaime Harrison, the South Carolina state chairman. Ellison made a point of name-checking Clinton before Sanders, and told the crowd he ultimately supported both candidates \u2013 Sanders in the primary and Clinton in the general election. \u201cWe need to unify, no matter who we supported in the primary,\u201d Ellison said. \u201cThis is a \u2018where were you?\u2019 moment, and that\u2019s why I got in the race,\u201d Perez added. \u201cUnited, we will be able to fight back and fight back successfully,\u201d said New Hampshire state chairman Ray Buckley. Buttigieg offered himself as a clean break from 2016 \u2013 and a voice from the heart of Trump country who could speak to the concerns of the working-class voters who have bolted from the Democratic Party. \u201cA lot of the people who live right down the street from me know he\u2019s not a good guy. They voted for him anyway,\u201d Buttigieg said of Trump. Democrats, he said, spent too much time hammering away at Trump and not enough communicating with voters who \u201cwere saying, who\u2019s talking about me?\u201d The 34-year-old mayor is a Rhodes Scholar, Afghanistan veteran and openly gay elected official in a conservative state. Buttigieg said he \u201cstarted 2017 in a deer blind with my boyfriend\u2019s father.\u201d There\u2019s a reason none of the Democratic candidates wants to cast the race as Sanders vs. Clinton, part two: It would make winning the race much more difficult. Ellison knows opposition from Clinton- and Obama-aligned forces would put a hard cap on his potential support \u2013 part of why his campaign played up the endorsement of Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer. Perez, meanwhile, knows that with several other candidates in the race, being the establishment pick isn\u2019t enough \u2013 and that the \u201cestablishment\u201d label is a trap in a party that has moved rapidly to the left. The other candidates\u2019 belief is that both Ellison and Perez will eventually top out shy of the votes they\u2019d need, and a third alternative acceptable to all the party\u2019s factions will emerge. Also in the race are Idaho Democratic Party executive director Sally Boynton Brown and Fox News analyst Jehmu Greene. \u201cI\u2019m sure,\u201d Greene joked, \u201ca lot of you are sitting out there saying, \u2018Jeh-who?\u2019\u201d There was some evidence that the 2016 tensions haven\u2019t eased entirely. Boynton Brown brought props \u2013 including a giant clear globe ornament that she said should represent the party\u2019s communication, rather than what she called a siloed structure that exists today \u2013 and called for the creation of a \u201cgrievance council\u201d within the DNC. \u201cUntil we start actually looking at who has issues with each other and bringing it down to the individual level,\u201d she said, \u201cwe\u2019re not going to solve this.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Democrats are gathering this weekend to begin trying to rebuild their decimated party \u2013 and, perhaps, blow off some steam. The Democratic National Committee will hold its first of four regional forums featuring the candidates to become party chair, ahead of an election in February. But before Democrats move on, they\u2019re going to revisit 2016. Sanders gets heated with Trump-supporting small business owner Bernie Sanders\u2019 supporters are still seething about the DNC\u2019s role in limiting the party\u2019s debate schedule and appearing to favor Hillary Clinton during the primaries. And the former secretary of state\u2019s loss to Donald Trump further angered progressives who saw Sanders successfully court the very working-class voters who abandoned Clinton, costing the party the White House. The race for DNC chair has turned into a de facto replay of the presidential primary. The top candidates: Minnesota Rep. Keith Ellison in the Sanders role and Labor Secretary Tom Perez from the Clinton camp. Ellison, like Sanders, has a base of progressives and working to expand beyond that. Perez has the more establishment backing from allies of Clinton and President Barack Obama. Pete Buttigieg, the mayor of South Bend, Indiana, is the more moderate, outside, alternative ala Martin O\u2019Malley, and three other candidates are also seeking the job. Despite the lofty title, the function of the national party chair is fairly limited. Fundraising and helping state and local parties develop the tools they need to operate and target Democratic voters central to the job \u2013 and coalition-building and television appearances are big parts of it. And the chair of the Democratic Party isn\u2019t necessarily the leader of the Democratic Party. The party\u2019s most important voices long-term are likely to be the candidates Democrats field in governor\u2019s races in Wisconsin, Ohio and Michigan \u2013 where the party\u2019s loss of white, working-class voters has been most acute. The Democratic National Committee is also unlikely to be a core driver of the party\u2019s messaging in the era of Trump \u2013 when figures including Sanders and Elizabeth Warren galvanize the party\u2019s liberal base in opposition to Trump. Indiana mayor Buttigieg enters DNC chair race \u201cElizabeth Warren and Bernie Sanders have de facto been catapulted into top leadership positions of the Democratic Party,\u201d said Adam Green, co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee. \u201cThey are, in many ways, the two top spokespeople for both the Democratic Party and the progressive caucus on the inside of Congress.\u201d Expecting more from a party chair, some Democrats said, would be to ignore the reality that opposition to Trump is what gels Democrats\u2019 disparate factions \u2013 and will continue to do so during his tenure in office. \u201cIn 2010, what was the message? Were Mitch McConnell and John Boehner the most compelling figures in America? No. People were galvanized by anger,\u201d said Neera Tanden, the president of the Democratic think tank Center for American Progress. \u201cThat\u2019s what\u2019s happening now.\u201d Increasingly, Democrats are acknowledging that the most daunting tasks the party faces aren\u2019t in messaging but technical \u2013 starting with reversing Republicans\u2019 gains in redistricting and in curbing voting access. Eric Holder, the former attorney general, kicked off a new initiative called the National Democratic Redistricting Committee on Thursday. It is intended to help the undo the favorable districts Republicans drew after clobbering Democrats in state legislative and governor\u2019s races in 2010 \u2013 the year of the last census. District lines won\u2019t be redrawn until 2020, but Holder argued Democrats need to begin readying their fundraising, court cases and more to fight what he called \u201cthe biggest rigged system in America.\u201d Connecticut Gov. Dan Malloy, who is leading the redistricting group along with Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi and Rep. Ben Ray Lujan, D-New Mexico, acknowledged Democrats nationally have ignored the state-level map-making fights for too long. \u201cWe should have gone to court much more quickly in the states that we eventually went to court in,\u201d he said in an interview, pointing to recent court victories in Virginia and Florida as evidence Democrats can force GOP-held legislatures\u2019 hands. Malloy argued a focus on governors\u2019 races in the coming years is critical, too \u2013 because those statewide races are more winnable than GOP-drawn state legislative districts, giving Democrats a voice or at least a veto in many states headed into 2020. He said the focus on redistricting is part of the party\u2019s broader need to turn its eyes from Washington to the states. \u201cI want a less Washington-centric party, quite frankly. I want a party that represents the diversity of Democratic interests and is a 50-state plus territory party,\u201d Malloy said. \u201cI think that is over-consideration of what\u2019s good for Washington has hurt the party, and listen \u2013 I want to control the Senate someday and I want to control the House someday,\u201d he said. \u201cBut that doesn\u2019t mean we should be sacrificing governor\u2019s races to do it when the governors are the most important factor in any state to being a vibrant Democratic Party.\u201d The other technical challenge, Democrats said, is voting access \u2013 a broad category that includes voter ID laws that many in the party believe unfairly punish older and urban voters, as well as early voting access and the ease of voter registration. Van Jones: 'The Clinton days are over' The Center for American Progress urged a focus on those voting access issues in a \u201cPath Forward\u201d report, attempting to steer Democrats\u2019 focus toward that issue as well as combating corruption and opposing Trump when his actions favor the wealthy over the working class. Attempting to remain upbeat, many Democrats argued recriminations over 2016 and the doom-and-gloom talk of the party\u2019s empty bench is reminiscent of John Kerry\u2019s loss to George W. Bush in 2004 and ignores recent political history. \u201cIf in January 2005, you would have told me that in 2009, the next president of the United States is going to be a man named Barack Obama, who\u2019s African-American and from Illinois,\u201d Tanden said, \u201cI would have been like, \u2018you\u2019re high.\u2019\u201d",

            "article_content": "Pete Buttigieg is 34, openly gay, a Harvard graduate, a Rhodes Scholar and a Naval officer Buttigieg called for an end to a race that has often looked like a Clinton-Sanders proxy battle Pete Buttigieg, a rising Midwestern star in his second term as mayor of South Bend, Indiana, is entering the race for Democratic National Committee chair, he announced Thursday. \u201cI don\u2019t think that there\u2019s any silver bullet to the party\u2019s issues, but I do think there\u2019s an opportunity, especially with a perspective that comes from state or local government, and from a part of the country where Democrats absolutely should be winning races, and haven\u2019t been,\u201d he said in an interview with CNN. Buttigieg joins a contest that has largely divided along the same lines as the party\u2019s 2016 primary \u2013 with backers of President Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton supporting Labor Secretary Tom Perez, and supporters of Sen. Bernie Sanders rallying behind Minnesota Rep. Keith Ellison. Buttigieg, who is 34 and openly gay, is a Harvard graduate and Rhodes Scholar. He served as a Naval officer in Afghanistan. His only bid for statewide office has been a failed 2010 campaign for Indiana state treasurer. However, he has won easily in South Bend, a manufacturing-heavy Rust Belt town that is home to Notre Dame University. Buttigieg said he wants to move the party past a backward-looking proxy battle. \u201cI think we need to get past that as a party. Reliving 2016 is not really good for business for the Democratic Party,\u201d he said. \u201cObviously, we can learn from the past, but this needs to be about the future. We have much more important things to fight than each other.\u201d He could help Democrats in a soul-searching phase as the party grapples with its loss of white working-class voters, which cost Clinton Wisconsin, Michigan and Pennsylvania, pushing Donald Trump toward the presidency. \u201cThis is exceptionally important: Speaking to one group of potential Democratic voters cannot mean abandoning another,\u201d Buttigieg said. He pointed to his own experience in South Bend, a city that has a sizable minority population, even though a majority of its residents are white. \u201cWe didn\u2019t pick one demographic over another. The point is, look, the core of our moral authority as a party is our defense of equality, fairness, things like voting rights,\u201d he said. \u201cBut we also are, I believe, motivated by values that are universal. I believe when we talk about fairness, we can do that in a way that appeals to all types of voters and all kinds of Americans. And I think not being afraid to talk about our values will resonate in places where we as a party have been struggling.\u201d In addition to Buttigieg, Perez and Ellison, South Carolina Democratic chairman Jaime Harrison and New Hampshire state chairman Ray Buckley are also in the DNC chair\u2019s race. Ellison and Perez each issued statements welcoming Buttigieg into the race. \u201cDemocrats deserve a vibrant conversation about the direction of our party,\u201d Perez said. \u201cPete showed tremendous courage during his re-election campaign when he came out \u2013 no easy thing to do in a red state like Indiana in the middle of an election,\u201d Ellison said. The party is set to meet for its first regional forum in Phoenix next week.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Bakari Sellers is a former Democratic member of the South Carolina House of Representatives and a CNN commentator. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. Since the election of President Donald Trump, Democrats have been obsessed with the disaffected Trump voter. I hate to break it to Democrats, but these voters just aren\u2019t that into you. Want proof? Look no further than Tuesday\u2019s shocker in Alabama. Seventy-seven percent of white working-class voters \u2013 white voters without a college degree who we can assume voted for Trump \u2013 cast a ballot for Republican Roy Moore. In stark contrast, virtually every black Alabamian \u2013 roughly 96%\u2013 voted for Sen.-elect Doug Jones. Black votes literally paved the way to victory for the long shot Democratic candidate. And statewide candidates in Ohio, Missouri, Florida, Michigan, Pennsylvania, and Maryland should take note. Joe Biden and Bernie Sanders are two notable Democrats with presidential aspirations who have been preoccupied with winning back the trust of disaffected Trump voters. So, after Tuesday, are we going to coddle voters who enthusiastically supported Moore, or are we going to prioritize our party\u2019s most loyal voting bloc? If Democrats expect to be competitive in 2018 and 2020, the answer is simple: Engage black voters. For a playbook on what effective black voter engagement looks like, Birmingham Mayor Randall Woodfin\u2019s campaign offers a strong example. Woodfin\u2019s task was no easy one.  He was up against an older, more established black elected official, William Bell, who was universally known.  And even though someone black was going to win anyway \u2013 because of the choices \u2013 it\u2019s worth paying attention to who came out to vote for Woodfin. Activist: Long time since black Alabama vote mattered Over 35% of Birmingham\u2019s registered voters cast their ballots in the October mayoral runoff election. And while over 11,000 voters had never voted in a municipal election, 1,500 of those voters were between the age of 18 and 24. Woodfin and his consultants from Pine Street Strategies, a D.C. lobbying firm, were able to cultivate grass-roots excitement because they spoke to African-Americans like \u201cpersuasion voters\u201d \u2013 or voters who you have to persuade to turn out to vote \u2013 instead  of assuming black voters will show up, as campaigns often do. Moreover, the Woodfin campaign engaged local black media around their policy platform and discussed issues with families across the city, and they responded accordingly at the polls. Voters in African-American strongholds like Ensley and Collegeville could tell you exactly what a Woodfin vote meant for their family and community. Of course Selma made the difference for Doug Jones This is how you engage black voters in 2018, and it\u2019s a stark departure from the traditional Democratic playbook of fish fries, photo ops, and last-minute ads. Real engagement also includes hiring diverse senior-level campaign consultants who do more than just African-American outreach. Our perspective has to be reflected in both black outreach and overall campaign strategy and messaging.  For instance, I find it hard to believe that the now-infamous Jones Confederate campaign ad would have seen the light of day if there were more African-Americans included in the development of that ad.  In a different race against a different candidate, that ad could have cost him the election. Lastly, engagement with black voters must start when the campaign starts \u2013 not during the last 30-day sprint to the finish line. Failing to prioritize African-Americans will ultimately leave valuable votes on the table, preventing Democrats from gaining back ground in state legislature and congressional seats that they have lost in the last decade.  But engaging black voters also does not stop when you win. For Jones, this means fighting to ensure cities like Birmingham, Selma and Montgomery, as well as Alabama\u2019s Black Belt counties are not afterthoughts during appropriations season.  It means engaging our radio and press outlets the same way you do mainstream outlets instead of simply buying ads during an election.  It means coming to our churches \u2013 and clapping on beat \u2013 even when there is not an election. Disaffected Trump voters showed us who they were during the presidential election and they reminded us of who they were on Tuesday in Alabama. It is time for Democrats to believe them and move on.",

The views expressed in this commentary are solely hers. Fiction is the closest I will ever get to feeling like someone else. This year, this polarized year, this year of Trump tweets and #MeToo and hurricanes and Klan rallies and mass shootings, I really needed that. So I made a list of the books that helped me better understand the news and newsmakers of 2017. Only one was actually published this year. The others are works I read in the past but whose lessons and characters lingered. I returned to them as if they were old friends and sought counsel on how we got here and where we\u2019re going. They helped me shift my perspective and, in the busiest news cycle of my 20 years in journalism, enabled a broader, longer view. Here are some of this year\u2019s top news stories and the books that helped me get through them: News: The polarization of America, 2017 Book: \u201cFreedom\u201d by Jonathan Franzen (2010) Confession: I hated this book when it first came out. The characters, liberal and conservative, are so incredibly selfish. When it came out and Jonathan Franzen made the cover of Time and President Obama read it on the beach, then Oprah\u2019s Book Club, too, I was appalled. Franzen\u2019s prose and pacing are masterful. But my main fear was that his storytelling, and the reception to it, redeemed his protagonists\u2019 pursuit of individualism instead of damning it. After the election of 2016, I\u2019m more comfortable celebrating Franzen\u2019s prescient portrait of the dysfunctional Berglund family and of ideology trumping community and compromise. That seems to reflect the state of American discourse, at least among power brokers and my friends on Facebook. The novel\u2019s initial reception included criticism that it was too obsessively political: Franzen\u2019s hatred of suburban sprawl, love of bicycles and the cerulean warbler. In hindsight, this is a seminal work connecting the political to the personal. The desire to be free, it turns out, comes at a steep price. News: White nationalists march on Charlottesville, Virginia Book: \u201cMy Name is Lucy Barton\u201d by Elizabeth Strout (2016) Why are they so angry? This was my question during the unrest in Charlottesville. The violence happened to peak the summer weekend my brother got married: a jubilant interracial wedding punctuated by news alerts about tiki torches and a white nationalist ramming a woman to death with his car. I came home from the wedding and reached (again) for \u201cMy Name is Lucy Barton\u201d by Elizabeth Strout. Raised in Midwestern poverty, Lucy works to get out of what we now call the \u201cwhite working class\u201d and becomes a successful writer. I found the passage where Lucy, sitting on her New York stoop, watches a gay couple walking by and feels wistful. \u201cI know it\u2019s terrible of me, but I\u2019m almost jealous of them. Because they have each other, they\u2019re tied together in a real community.\u201d She goes on, \u201c\u2026in spite of my plenitude, I was lonely. Lonely was the first flavor I had tasted in my life, and it was always there.\u201d Everybody needs a community, most of all the loneliest among us. News: Las Vegas mass shooting Book: \u201cThe Goldfinch\u201d by Donna Tartt (2013) It was the deadliest mass shooting in modern history. Most reporting focused on the \u201cStrip,\u201d the section of Las Vegas we visit as tourists. Killer Stephen Paddock lived 80 miles away, in the exurb of Mesquite. Farmers there once grew grapes for raisins and raised dairy cows. Now there\u2019s a Walmart and eight golf courses and clubs. I read profiles of Paddock \u2013 he gambled, dabbled in real estate, took Valium for his nerves and hated to be out in the sun \u2013 and instinctively felt I knew the place he called home. That\u2019s thanks to \u201cThe Goldfinch,\u201d where Donna Tartt takes us into the transitioning Las Vegas suburbs to understand \u201cwhat tourists never see.\u201d When her main character Theo leaves New York and moves in with his deadbeat dad, he is welcomed by a sea of shopping plazas and identical housing developments against a vast Nevada sky that nurtures restlessness. He meets his drug dealer of a stepmother and makes a sketchy best friend. Vegas\u2019 vice, it seems, has no borders. News: #MeToo Book: \u201cAn Obedient Father\u201d by Akhil Sharma (2000) This is a sickening book. Ram Karan works as a civil servant in New Delhi\u2019s notorious bureaucracy and lives with his daughter and granddaughter. He accepts bribes and carries a horrible family secret. Ages ago, before embarking on an overseas assignment, I read this book to understand India. This year, I turned to it to understand two themes: Moral corruption and political corruption; moral depravity and political depravity. This book confirms my conviction that you cannot separate the two. \u201cAn Obedient Father\u201d evokes sympathy for a sexual predator in Karan, weak and flawed as he is. Despite his ugliness \u2013 and, arguably, that of the current lot of men behaving badly or exposed as having done so in the past \u2013 there is also triumph. They are simple victories for those around him, such as survival, love and the power of confrontation, but victories nonetheless. These days, I cling to them. News: The growing threat of North Korea Book: \u201cPachinko\u201d by Min Jin Lee (2017) We glimpsed the cruelty of North Korea in the story of Otto Warmbier, the American student detained there, then repatriated while in a coma. I knew why they sent him back home. Months earlier, I had read this passage: \u201cSunja nodded, having told herself long ago to expect the worst. The elders in her church had warned her that the Korean prisoners were usually sent home just as they were about to die, so that they would not die in jail. The prisoners were beaten, starved, and made to go without clothing to weaken them.\u201d Sunja is the Korean daughter we meet and grow to love in \u201cPachinko,\u201d my favorite book of the year. I never really knew the history of Koreans\u2019 migration to Japan, and the sheer discrimination and displacement they encountered. The characters contend with allegiances to country, family, religion \u2013 only to learn they might never quite belong.  Min Jin Lee\u2019s rendering of one family\u2019s journey helps explain the history of both countries in such an accessible, intimate manner. I think of it with every tweetstorm, headline and \u201cLittle Rocket Man\u201d reference on escalating tensions among the United States, North Korea and Japan, and the people and identities most affected by war.  The opening words to the novel portend the cyclical nature of cruelty: \u201cHistory has failed us, but no matter.\u201d Thankfully, her words do not. As this year in my life as a journalist, reader and citizen has shown me: We read, we report, we revisit \u2014 with hopes that maybe one day, we\u2019ll learn.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Tom Perez is the chairman of the Democratic National Committee. Keith Ellison is the US representative for Minnesota\u2019s 5th Congressional District and the deputy chair of the DNC. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the authors. Trust holds families together, and our Democratic family is no exception. As we enter the final meeting of the Democratic National Committee\u2019s Unity Reform Commission, where members will vote on proposals to reform the Democratic Party, we must focus on ensuring that voters across the nation trust our party. As chair and deputy chair of the DNC, we are committed to ensuring that our party is inclusive, forward-looking and bold in prescribing an alternative to President Donald Trump\u2019s destructive policies and his politics of divisiveness and deception. We know Democrats can win big in 2018 and 2020, just as we did this year in New Jersey, Virginia and across the country \u2013 but we know we can only do that by rebuilding trust with those who share our progressive vision for America and by addressing concerns many have raised in recent years. Democrats can win big if we\u2019re united, and we know that can only happen by healing divisions that still linger from last year\u2019s bruising presidential nominating contest. This has never been more important. This is one of the biggest stress tests our democracy has ever faced. Middle-class families and the working poor have not shared in the Wall Street boom. The Koch brothers and their band of ultra-conservative billionaire friends continue to assert an already outsize influence on our elections. Fareed: Democrats must bridge cultural gulf Republicans are leading a coordinated, nationwide effort of voter suppression and partisan gerrymandering, both of which threaten the right of the American people to exercise power over their government and hold their representatives accountable. And there is growing evidence that the Russian government and the Trump campaign may have conspired to interfere with the 2016 election. We\u2019ve made considerable progress over the past year, but there is no doubt that we have a long way to go. We believe Democrats can win everywhere if we organize and lead with our values. That\u2019s why we\u2019ve implemented our \u201cEvery ZIP Code Counts\u201d strategy and changed the DNC\u2019s mission so that we\u2019re no longer just focused on electing the president, but on electing all Democrats from the school board to the Oval Office. Rather than spending money on TV, we\u2019ve focused our efforts on organizing and connecting directly with voters. In fact, through our Resistance Summer program, the new Democratic Party knocked on more than 1 million doors to invite Americans of all walks of life to join us. We made historic investments in Virginia, New Jersey, and in mayoral and legislative races that helped pay big dividends with our major victories last month. Northam: I hope to win your confidence The challenge that lies ahead is to build on the successes of 2017 and continue the progress we\u2019re making to rebuild our party, organize, modernize and win. We have opportunities at every level in 2018. We can win back governorships and state legislatures. And we\u2019re looking to 2020 to make sure the process is as fair and transparent as possible. In addition to our commitment and in advance of the Unity Reform Commission\u2019s report, we also want to express support for additional reforms that will help ensure the 2020 presidential primary is the most fair, transparent and successful in our history. We will not win the future by re-litigating the past. But we do have to learn from our past mistakes. That\u2019s why we hope DNC members and our Unity Reform Commission will vote to pass the following reforms: It\u2019s critically important that the DNC doesn\u2019t put its thumb on the scale \u2013 in perception or reality \u2013 or that any primary candidate has an unfair advantage. As chair and deputy chair we also believe that we must ensure: \u2022 No party officer should be allowed to support, endorse or favor any candidate in the primary process. \u2022 The debate schedule is decided in advance, instead of negotiating it after all our candidates have entered the race. \u2022 Any and all joint fundraising agreements will be transparent and available to all official campaigns. Murphy: My agenda is about economy, not Trump In addition, we need to give voters more opportunity to participate in our primaries. In too many states, deadlines to change one\u2019s party affiliation are months before voter registration deadlines. This doesn\u2019t make sense and only hurts voters by forcing them to choose their affiliation long before Election Day. These reforms should be part of our broader efforts to make it easier for eligible people to vote. At the DNC, we\u2019ve been hard at work challenging the Republican assault on voting rights across the country. But we must work with states to implement policies that make it easier to vote, including vote-by-mail laws, automatic voter registration, same-day voter registration, expanded access to the polls and more robust voter protection efforts. There are too many working people, members of the military, older Americans and students who are left out and not able to make their voices heard at their caucuses because of work, child care or other obligations. That\u2019s unacceptable. We can and we must do better. That is why it\u2019s critical that the Unity Reform Commission provide recommendations that acknowledge the grass-roots benefit of the caucus process while also finding ways for those who have been excluded on caucus nights to have their votes counted. Sanders: \"I'm going to be campaigning as hard as I can\" In 2016, unpledged delegates, or what some call \u201csuper delegates,\u201d made up almost 15% of all delegates at the national convention. To create a fairer process for all candidates and empower grass-roots voters, it is critical that the Unity Reform Commission provide recommendations that uphold the mandate passed by the 2016 Democratic National Convention and provide for a significant reduction in the number of unpledged delegates. Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton and Sen. Bernie Sanders both agreed on this mandate. If we want Democrats to win and stay in power, we have to reform our party in ways that rebuild it from the ground up. A unified Democratic Party is a party that understands that every ZIP code counts and there\u2019s no such thing as an off-year. We\u2019ve already begun making new investments in our state parties and down-ballot races, and our efforts have helped Democrats secure critical victories \u2013 from Virginia and New Jersey to Oklahoma and New Hampshire. In addition, we must continue to empower diverse grass-roots Democrats at the leadership table. We will build on our recent successes with small-dollar fundraising. And we changed our rules in October to ban corporate donations from political action committees whose goals conflict with our platform. We look forward to finding new ways to make sure we are supporting candidates and state parties across the country in order to succeed in 2017, 2018, and beyond. The DNC has come a long way since the 2016 election, but we know we have much further to go to earn the trust of voters and bring more people into the electoral process. We have our values and the support of the vast majority of the American people by our side. And when we lead with those values, we win. The Unity Reform Commission is making our nomination process fairer for all. This work is critical to empowering voters, strengthening our party, and ensuring that Democrats are successful in 2018, 2020 and beyond.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Kristin Rowe-Finkbeiner is executive director and co-founder of MomsRising.org, a nonprofit national organization that supports policies to improve family economic security. She is the author of the forthcoming book, \u201cKeep Marching.\u201d The views expressed here are her own. Kristin Rowe-Finkbeiner: The GOP tax plan is especially harmful to women and families The plan would grow our national debt while rewarding ultra-rich individuals and corporations, she writes Tax plans can be hard to decipher, but with each passing day, women and moms across the country understand more clearly how the GOP tax plans \u2014 both the US Senate and the House versions \u2013 will affect their families and our economy. At MomsRising, we hear from moms \u2013 from Alaska to Alabama \u2013 every day and they are telling us they are terrified. Over the last few weeks, we\u2019ve seen rumblings of concern turn to full-fledged alarm about what this tax plan will mean for America\u2019s women. Their worries are certainly justified. The GOP tax plans are the opposite of what women and our economy need.  Women in the United States of America are already facing severe economic inequality at the exact same time as the cost of raising children, and the percentage of families who are relying on the wages of women to make ends meet, are rising quickly. Times have changed.  For instance, women are now breadwinners in more than half of all families \u2014 and are the primary breadwinner in 42% of families, according to Pew; and over the past 30 years, childcare costs for working families have increased by 70%, according to Census Bureau data. Yet women on average earned just 80 cents to a man\u2019s dollar in 2017, with moms and women of color experiencing increased wage hits. Women are under financial duress even as our purchasing power is needed to fuel our economy.  That\u2019s right: The vast majority of purchasing decisions are made by women in our country, where according to the World Bank, 70% of our GDP is now based on consumer spending. Economic inequality for women is a huge weakness for our nation, and the GOP proposed tax plans in the US House and Senate could turn that disaster into a national calamity. Want to know who will reap huge rewards under this plan? Ultrawealthy individuals and corporations who aren\u2019t hanging on by a thread.  For instance, the top 0.1%, households with incomes over $3.1 million per year, would gain nearly $100,000 in tax cuts a year. In stark contrast, the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office estimates households making $75,000 or less a year, while likely to see modest cuts in the short term, will see a tax increase over the next decade under the Senate bill. In fact, nonpartisan estimates reported by the National Women\u2019s Law Center found that over 75% of the GOP tax plan\u2019s benefits would go to the wealthiest 20% of households, while the bottom 20% would only receive around 2% of the benefits. Simply put, women and middle-class families would be further buried by this tax plan. It\u2019s appalling in both the House and Senate versions. It\u2019s a back-door evisceration of the health care coverage voters in every state in our nation have said they need. On childcare and many other measures, it\u2019s grossly insufficient. The GOP tax plan amounts to a massive wealth shift in an economy that already has massive wealth inequality. Here\u2019s a reality check for the GOP: Our country is now the third worst nation in terms of income inequality \u2014 after Chile and Mexico \u2014 among the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development countries. Dear senators: Don't bankrupt our country Because of this rising wealth inequality, MIT economist Peter Temin recently pointed out that we\u2019re regressing to developing nation status. This doesn\u2019t bode well for our future economic success as a country. One example of how the House and Senate tax plans bolster income inequality is their treatment of \u201cpass through\u201d business income.  Although \u201cpass through\u201d tax changes are being sold as a benefit to small businesses and Main Street, it turns out these changes would greatly benefit the already-wealthy \u2013 like Donald Trump, who is lobbying for this \u2013 while only about 2% of households with incomes below $100,000, the true small business owners, would get any tax benefit at all. In fact, it\u2019s the top 1% who gain the vast majority of the benefit from \u201cpass-throughs.\u201d This isn\u2019t Main Street being helped. This is Wall Street getting a handout. By doubling down on wealth inequality, the GOP tax plan would jeopardize the health, financial stability, and future of millions of women and families across our country while growing our national debt over the next decade by over $1.3 trillion in the House version; estimates on the Senate bill range from $1.4 to $1.6 trillion, according to the Penn-Wharton Budget Model. It will leave a legacy of debt our children will spend their lives trying to pay off. The women of America know that it\u2019s not OK to raise taxes for millions of people while gutting essential provisions that boost our access to health care, education and housing, and that fuel our economy. That\u2019s not smart economic policy. We also know that it\u2019s not OK to starve the federal budget in ways that are sure to put Medicare, Medicaid, food stamps, Head Start and other essential programs on the chopping block. It\u2019s also not OK to pretend trickle-down economics is going to work now, when it never has before.  The women of America also know these GOP tax plans don\u2019t reflect our values, don\u2019t recognize our contributions, and don\u2019t boost our economy. Most heartbreaking of all, we know that the GOP tax plan, which is being rushed through even though it\u2019s the most comprehensive tax reform bill in decades, takes an ax to the American dream for many of our children. Members of Congress who vote to pass the GOP tax plan do so at their own risk. Women are watching, counting this vote, and will remember this at re-election time. It\u2019s time for congressional Republicans to rethink their approach, invest in programs that help reduce income inequality and boost our economy, and open the doors to opportunity, instead of slam them shut.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Aaron David Miller is a vice president and distinguished scholar at the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars and was a Middle East negotiator in Democratic and Republican administrations. The views expressed in this commentary are his own. Aaron David Miller: Benjamin Netanyahu is facing a slew of investigations Don't bet against the Prime Minister -- he's a true survivor in Israeli politics In Israeli politics, the old saying goes, you can be dead or dead and buried. There are rarely second acts. But then there is Benjamin Netanyahu \u2013 a man who has survived defeat, scandal and now, in his fourth term, stands to become the longest-serving Israeli Prime Minister in Israel\u2019s short history. In doing so he would surpass the towering figure of David Ben-Gurion. That is if he survives in the post into 2018. And the chances are that he will. But in a rather remarkable career of ups and downs, Netanyahu is facing the biggest crisis of his political life. A close aide, Ari Harow, has cut a deal with the Israeli attorney general to turn state\u2019s witness and threatens to shed light on a slew of open investigations that may well bring charges of bribery and graft. Netanyahu denies the allegations. Plenty of analysts and pundits have lost money betting against Netanyahu and he is no speed bump in Israeli politics \u2013 he is a survivor. Much could change before year\u2019s end, but here are some observations about the swirling storm that might soon engulf Israeli politics. Any of those Netanyahu critics and haters expecting the prime minister to be gone yesterday ought to lie down and wait quietly until the feeling passes. It took two years for the indictment of former Prime Minister Ehud Olmert, just released from a shortened prison sentence. Indeed, Olmert was forced from power in 2008 under the pressure of police investigations, but remained as head of a caretaker government until early elections in 2009. Ya'alon: I think Netanyahu will be indicted In Netanyahu\u2019s case, you would first need a police recommendation to indict, a decision that would likely not arrive until this fall after the Knesset is in session and the Jewish holidays have concluded. And then, because the state witness\u2019s testimony would have to be fully investigated, the matter could easily stretch into 2018. Israel\u2019s attorney general and state prosecutor would then have to weigh the issue of an indictment, with a formal hearing on the matter. And, as in most prosecutions, the decision to indict is going to be shaped by the evidence and the whether it\u2019s good enough to produce a conviction. By law the answer is no. But an indictment and a public bill of particulars with serious changes \u2013 e.g. bribery \u2013 would force the issue into the court of public and political opinion. Various parties in the coalition might have no choice but to bolt, even though new elections might not be in their interest. Netanyahu has crossed many of his former partners, some of whom, like rival Naftali Bennett, have political aspirations, so there\u2019s a good chance that the government would fall. It\u2019s always possible that the coalition might rally around him, but it\u2019s hard to imagine a situation where Netanyahu could remain prime minister if he goes on trial for corruption. Indeed there\u2019s no precedent for a sitting prime minister being charged. The end of Netanyahu does not mean the beginning of a serious peace process. Benjamin Netanyahu likely never saw himself as the Israeli prime minister who was going to be the father of Palestinian statehood, based on a political division of Jerusalem, dismantling of settlements, and borders of a Palestinian state kept close to June 1967 lines. Israel's police reveal Netanyahu probes involve bribery, breach of trust He has proven himself highly risk-averse on matters of war and peacemaking. And his self-image and ideology make it difficult to imagine that he\u2019d ever agree to anything close to the current Palestinian narrative. Still he\u2019s not the most right-wing leader in his coalition; and is indeed flanked by others, particularly Naftali Bennet, much tougher than he. Indeed it\u2019s hard to see anyone in the Likud or right-wing universe that has the willingness and ability to lead boldly on the peace process. The new head of the Labor Party, Avi Gabbay, is a compelling and attractive figure who threatens to steal away votes from Likud because of his modest background. But running on the peace process in the current climate \u2013 framed by violence, a dysfunctional Palestinian national movement, and a weak Mahmoud Abbas \u2013hardly seems like a winning hand And remember: the issue in Israeli politics is who can put a viable coalition together. As the old saw goes, a leader without followers is just a guy out for a walk. To identify the peace process as a key issue in an election, should Netanyahu meet his political demise, you\u2019d need some real drama; a clear choice before the Israeli public of a popular candidate Israelis trust on security and a Palestinian or Arab partners offer of real peace and security. And that\u2019s a stretch. In fact, Palestinians now worry that under pressure of investigations, Netanyahu may want to solidify his ties to the right and take actions on the ground that might foreclose once and for all the possibility of a two-state solution. Netanyahu has dominated Israeli politics for most of the past decade. It\u2019s illogical to assume that his departure would not create a new and dynamic political reality. But what kind of reality is another matter. With the deaths of Peres and Sharon \u2013 the last of Israel\u2019s founding generation \u2013 Israel faces its own kind of leadership transition and challenges. And a younger generation of Prime Ministers \u2013 Olmert (recently out of prison); Ehud Barak (deeply mistrusted); and Netanyahu (maybe soon-to-be indicted) haven\u2019t really risen to replace them. Former speaker of the Knesset, Avraham Burg, used to compare Shimon Peres to an evergreen tree \u2013 stately and impressive, but underneath nothing grows. Netanyahu has clearly and willfully groomed no successors, and has in fact alienated most of his former Likud colleagues. Still a recent poll even predicted that Likud might fare better in the next election without Netanyahu. Who on the right would replace him, however \u2013 and who has the political smarts, the stamina, and the security credentials to motivate the Likud base and broaden it to take votes away from the center right? Several members of Likud would like the job. but who among them would be electable is very much an open question. As for the Labor Party and Mr. Gabbay, a self-made millionaire who seems able to relate to working-class Israelis, and who the Guardian described as the Israeli (Emmanuel) Macron \u2013 who really knows?  Labor hasn\u2019t won an election in 18 years and right now is polling third after Likud and the center-right party Yesh Atid, headed by another possible prime ministerial candidate, Yair Lapid. It\u2019s even possible that there is some set of circumstances in which Mr. Netanyahu somehow survives. If he doesn\u2019t, perhaps the change and transition will produce new leaders and real choices \u2013 or a new boss locked into more or less the same patterns of behavior and confronted with the same options as the old one. Either way, buckle your seat belts and get ready for a turbulent period in Israeli politics.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Michael Weiss is an international affairs analyst for CNN and author of \u201cISIS: Inside the army of terror.\u201d Michael Weiss: Anthony Scaramucci didn't  stray far from the rough and tumble history of America's political discourse Weiss: In 2016, the professional political observers missed the appeal of this type of New Yorker to middle America It was in the final years of the 1990s that British columnist David Aaronovitch experienced that inevitable moment that befalls all parents of small children. Watching a news program on the unprecedented spectacle of an American president facing impeachment over his lies about liaisons with a White House intern, he heard the presenter utter the phrase, \u201coral sex in the vestibule.\u201d Turning nervously to his adolescent daughter by his side, Aaronovitch felt an unexpected mixture of surprise and relief when he was met with the question, \u201cDaddy, what\u2019s a vestibule?\u201d Some years later, Dick Cheney faced critical comments from Sen. Patrick Leahy about his former company Halliburton\u2019s involvement in Iraq\u2019s reconstruction. \u201cGo f\u2014 yourself,\u201d the vice president told the Vermont Democrat, during a class photo session on the Senate floor. The imperative was printed unbowdlerized in several national outlets and Cheney later recalled it as \u201csort of the best thing I ever did\u201d \u2014 a judgment historians might actually find persuasive. Last Thursday, incoming, and now outgoing, White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci suggested that, unlike one of his colleagues, he was not trying to fellate himself, an observation delivered in a colorful diatribe to the New Yorker in reaction to the steady trickle of rumors and innuendo emanating from the Trump aide. Scaramucci used a downtown phrase to describe an underground feat of dexterous self-pleasure, which has creatively taxed the translation teams of several foreign newspapers, cost him a 10 day-old job and made him even more of a punch line on social media platforms and late-night talk shows than he had been. But it has also led to vaporous commentary about the supposed debasement of our political \u201cdiscourse,\u201d which wasn\u2019t entirely lofty when Adams and Jefferson stalked the nation\u2019s capital \u2014 with their surrogates accusing each other of having ambiguous anatomy and pedigree \u2014 much less so when LBJ and Nixon did. When he was just a junior senator from Illinois, Barack Obama described the man who would be his future White House chief of staff, Rahm Emanuel, thus: \u201cI think, as many of you were aware, he was working at a deli, [had an] accident with a meat slicing machine, he lost part of his middle finger, and as a result of this, this rendered him practically mute.\u201d Another way of stating the obvious would be to say that American politics has never enjoyed much civility, as much as we nostalgically like to pretend otherwise in these periodic moments of righteous pique. Scaramucci fit in perfectly with the Trump ethos and might still be in a job if he hadn\u2019t been declared FUBAR by John Kelly, a retired no-nonsense four-star Marine and now Trump\u2019s chief of staff. The presumptuous Beltway outsider figured he could buck the rules of the Washington game, by stabbing his enemies in the front rather than in the back. And what\u2019s wrong with that? \u201cI think a lot of people are clutching their pearls,\u201d Christina Greer, a professor of political science at Fordham University, told the New York Daily News last Saturday. \u201cOne, because it is so vulgar. Two, because this is a person that is a representative of the President of the United States.\u201d Few American voters have got pearls to clutch or can profess themselves shocked to discover that a stubby Long Islander with big hair and ring jewelry really does sound like Joe Pesci in \u201cCasino.\u201d And raise your hand, please, if you thought that a President who boasts of his own familiarity with other people\u2019s genitals and begs journalists to relate how intelligent and well-liked and financially savvy he is was likely to find such phone chatter anything other than absolutely disarming. In fact, as The New York Times reported, Trump was initially delighted with Scaramucci\u2019s put-downs of Reince Priebus and Steve Bannon. He only soured on the denunciations, the Times noted, when he realized his newest hire\u2019s outsize ego and press were beginning to eclipse his own. One of the core ironies of the 2016 election is that the professional political observers who were an Uber ride away from JFK Airport were precisely the ones to miss the appeal of this type of New Yorker to middle America. There is a kind of mournful, Freudian poetry to the patois of the outer boroughs, of which Scaramucci is now, for better or worse, the global embodiment. Even as on-paper specimens of the so-called \u201cestablishment,\u201d they can never feel as if they\u2019ve truly made it and so they behave as outcasts of the American dream rather than as realizations of it. \u201cAnyone who thinks money is ever just money, Dick, couldn\u2019t have much of it,\u201d Charles Van Doren tells Richard Goodwin, the special counsel to the House Legislative Oversight Committee who eventually unravels the racket that was \u201cTwenty One\u201d in the movie \u201cQuiz Show.\u201d And anyone who makes money after coming from nothing knows what it can never quite buy: the acceptance of the Sutton Place and Hyannis Port sets. Scaramucci grew up the son of an Italian-American plumber but in Port Washington, the model upon which Fitzgerald based East Egg in \u201cThe Great Gatsby,\u201d which is certainly one way to inculcate permanent class anxiety. I spent the formative years of my life surrounded by people who talk exactly as the Mooch does, and overcompensate for modest beginnings in the same spirit of desperation and defiance. It\u2019s difficult some days to tell where my aunt\u2019s Thanksgiving dinners in Far Rockaway end and the leadership of the free world begins. Bye bye, Mooch Notice how Scaramucci name-checks Harvard Law School, an alma mater that evidently thought he was dead until recently, at the least relevant moments in news conferences and TV appearances. (If he were really to the manner born, he\u2019d only ever say that he went to \u201cschool in Boston.\u201d) By doing this, he isn\u2019t reminding you of his legal erudition, which would be obnoxious enough, but of his worthiness to be talking to you in the first place. In literature, this is the stuff of pathos, not comedy.  Trump, too, weirdly suffers from the same pathology of self-perception, even though he has absolutely no reason to. He was born a millionaire scion of a real estate magnate \u2014 granted, in Queens, not Manhattan. His boorishness is true-blue, but his autobiography of a self-made man is, unlike Scaramucci\u2019s, completely invented. Even still, it is remarkable how long Trump has carried this image of himself as a beggar at the feast, a working-class stiff gatecrashing the country club. In 1990, he was interviewed by Vanity Fair \u2014 of all magazines \u2014 and came away sounding more like a social conservative from the deep South distinguishing \u201creal America\u201d from the coastal Gomorrahs rather than the mogul whose extramarital affair made tabloid headlines. \u201cThere are two publics as far as I\u2019m concerned,\u201d Trump said. \u201cThe real public and then there\u2019s the New York society horses\u2014. The real public has always liked Donald Trump. The real public feels that Donald Trump is going through Trump-bashing. When I go out now, forget about it. I\u2019m mobbed. It\u2019s bedlam.\u201d Several bankruptcies, comebacks and an Electoral College vote later, and his tune hasn\u2019t changed a note. The Mooch, unlike his former boss, is the more genuine Everyman raging in his gilt tower.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: John B. King Jr. is a former secretary of education for the Obama administration and president and CEO at The Education Trust. Jidenna is a recording artist and producer. The views expressed in this commentary are solely those of the authors. John B. King and Jidenna: It is beyond time that we stand up against the assault on the American dream, especially for young people of color Teachers can make all the difference in a kid's life. Our lives are proof, they write -- and we need more teachers of color All too often, \u201cA dream deferred is a dream denied.\u201d Langston Hughes challenged us with this reality through his poem, \u201cHarlem,\u201d more than 60 years ago. Poets can speak truth in a time of struggle. Poets also can be prophets in verse. Today, the American dream remains out of reach for far too many people \u2013 and far too often, it is people of color who still have to fight the hardest to achieve it because of systemic biases, structural obstacles and inequalities in opportunity. The promise of America is that through hard work, perseverance and a good education everyone can get ahead, land a good job, provide for their families and lead successful lives. Our nation\u2019s history is the story of that promise being made more real \u2013 in painful fits and starts \u2013 for an ever-widening circle of Americans. From the Civil War to the civil rights movement, from the women\u2019s suffrage movement to the continuing fight for equal pay for equal work, progress has been far too slow, but it has been real. Today, the American dream needs people to stand up in its defense, especially because of what feels like a daily assault. We need action. We need action in matters of life and death, including the senseless killings of Tamir Rice and Philando Castile.  And we need action in matters that affect millions of lives, including the reckless rollbacks on civil rights and harmful cuts to vital programs by the Trump administration. Trump proposes eliminating after-school program We need action when the 45th President proposes to reduce federal funding for education by more than 13% (about $10 billion). We need action when the administration attempts to raid nearly $4 billion in reserves from Pell Grants (federal financial aid for low-income students to attend college). And we need action when the safety net for low-income families across the nation could be slashed through proposals that would cut support for housing, public transportation and health care. We are speaking out now because it is beyond time that we stand up against this senseless assault on the American dream, especially for young people of color. Sadly, we know that the Trump administration\u2019s proposals will exacerbate inequities that already exist. African-Americans and Latinos are significantly overrepresented among the poor in our country. Black and Hispanic families have less than one-tenth of the household wealth of white families in America. And the Urban Institute notes that young men and boys of color are twice as likely to grow up in poverty as their white counterparts. Over the last few decades, many states have increased their investments in locking people up faster than in lifting them up through education. In fact, some states have increased spending on jails at five times the rate of increase in spending on public schools, contributing to a school-to-prison pipeline that disproportionately funnels youth of color into our criminal justice system. DeVos, Trump, and what we're missing about HBCUs And while 63% of white students who begin college complete college within six years, just over half of Latino students and only 40% of black students do. These gaps in college completion affect job prospects. The unemployment rate for African-Americans is nearly double the rate for whites, and a persistent gap remains between whites and Latinos. All of these numbers add up to lost potential. And they represent troubling inequities in our systems and society that are drawn along lines of race and class. Recently, people across the country have been voicing their concerns on these issues and more by marching in the streets. But protest by itself \u2013 while critically important \u2013 isn\u2019t a guarantee of progress. We also need solutions. The real resistance is in the daily fight for equity and opportunity for all, in building a movement to put kids and communities first, and in pulling the disenfranchised up, rather than pushing them down and to the margins. We write this piece to call for action on behalf of our children, so they can build a better future for themselves and future generations. It is simply not enough to shout about the problem. How data can debunk the 'model minority' myth To be true advocates, yes, we have to show up on the streets of Chicago, Los Angeles, Boston, New York or Washington, D.C. We also have to sit down at community meetings in rural New Mexico or Alabama. We have to run for that open school board seat in our town. And we have to realize how important it is to vote \u2013 not just every four years in a presidential election, but in contests that decide who represents us in city hall, the state house, and Congress. One way to make change, especially for our youth, is to get involved in schools. Consider becoming a teacher \u2013especially for people of color, who represent just 18% of the teaching force when the majority of students in our nation\u2019s public schools are students of color. As exciting as it is to aspire to be the next hip-hop king or basketball MVP, we need more educators of color. A recent study by Johns Hopkins University finds that having a black teacher for just one year is associated with a nearly 30% reduction in the risk of a black student dropping out. Teachers can make all the difference in a kid\u2019s life. Our lives are proof. Teacher: I wrote a song to help my students build confidence We both experienced challenges when we were young. One of us is an immigrant from Nigeria who encountered racism on his first day of school in the United States, but who was supported by educators and ultimately became a teacher himself, while working to pursue a music career. And one of us is an African-American and Latino from Brooklyn, who lost both of his parents to illness by the time he was 12 years old and was kicked out of high school \u2013 but his teachers stepped in to save his life. Because of our own experiences as educators, we understand that when kids are kicked out of school, they can be made to feel like they are less than their classmates or that their lives don\u2019t matter. This is an experience that our young people of color face much more often than their peers. In fact, Black babies as young as 4 years old make up just 18% of the preschoolers in our country, but 48% of preschool children suspended more than once. And 1.6 million students \u2013 predominately those in low-income areas \u2013 attend school where there is a sworn law enforcement officer, but no school counselor. Despite this, we are hopeful. That immigrant kid who struggled? He went on to become a successful musical artist and activist. And that kid who lost his parents and was kicked out of high school? He became a teacher, too, served as President Obama\u2019s secretary of education, and now is an advocate fighting every day for equal rights for all kids.  Somewhere today, there is a young person who feels hopeless, who is fighting against the lure of the streets, who may have been suspended or expelled or had a brush with the juvenile justice system, or who is part of a family in crisis. We must show young people that they matter, that we believe in them and their potential. It\u2019s time to defend the American dream and not defer it for any of our children. We need more champions for our kids who take action \u2013 because they care, not because of who they can call to showcase their goodwill. Now is the time to act.",

The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. Julian Zelizer: Every day there is a new story about Donald Trump and the Russians There are four possible scenarios that could explain the President's true intentions The news about President Donald Trump and Russia just keeps on coming. After the President had to deal with the fallout from his son\u2019s controversial June 2016 meeting with a Russian lawyer, we keep learning that there were more and more people in the room. The meeting is beginning to feel like a clown car \u2013 one more person keeps jumping out just when you think the vehicle is empty. The latest attendee to emerge is a man who works for a Russian oligarch. Following this revelation, the leaders of the Senate Judiciary Committee have reached an interim deal with Donald Trump Jr. and Paul Manafort, who also attended the meeting. Instead of testifying at a public hearing on Wednesday, they will be privately interviewed and provide any records the committee requests. Why Russia-probe investigators are looking at anti-money laundering database And this news came sooner after Ian Bremmer, the head of Eurasia Group, a global political risk research and consulting group, revealed that the President reportedly had a previously undisclosed second meeting with Vladimir Putin at a G-20 dinner, at which they were so chummy other world leaders felt \u201cflummoxed\u201d and \u201cconfused.\u201d The President then provided the New York Times with a rambling interview during which he strongly criticized Attorney General Jeff Sessions and Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein, while indirectly threatening Robert Mueller not to look into his family finances. As if all this was not enough, the Washington Post is now reporting that, according to US intelligence intercepts, then-Senator Jeff Sessions, while serving as foreign policy advisor to then candidate Trump, met twice with the Russian Ambassador Sergey Kislyak and discussed matters of high importance to Russia. Axelrod: Trump's Putin meeting should set off alarm bells Meanwhile, Anthony Scaramucci, the new White House Communications Director, told CNN\u2019s State of the Union on Sunday that Trump had still not accepted the intelligence community\u2019s report of Russian meddling in the 2016 election. Yet each new revelation brings back the question of who is Donald Trump and what\u2019s going on with Russia. The answer could have huge political consequences. There are at least four possible scenarios. One possibility is that, apart from the Trump Tower meeting organized by Don Jr., there was no problematic meeting with the Russians and that meddling in the campaign proceeded with no buy-in or cooperation from Trump\u2019s team. In the view of Trump\u2019s Chief of Staff Reince Priebus, the Russia story is a \u201cnothing-burger\u201d \u2013 the entire story is made up. This is a view that much of the Trump base shares. Can President Trump pardon himself? In this view, a news media that is eager to bring the President down has manipulated the public, made up information through false \u201cunnamed sources\u201d and called regular interactions untoward just to generate a scandal. This version of events leaves President Trump as the victim, a virtuous leader who has been under unfair assault from his enemies. Some find this explanation hard to believe given the vast amount of information that has come out, including from James Comey and the Trumps themselves. But it is possible that the Trump Tower meeting was questionable judgement at worst, and that there were no further interactions. Another somewhat less benign way to see the story suggests that Trump was a figurehead who was manipulated by advisors, including members of his own family such as Jared Kushner and figures such as Paul Manafort, whose consulting firm was paid more than $17 million to work on behalf of a pro-Russia party in Ukraine, prior to his joining the campaign. In this scenario, while Trump was figuring out new phrases to insult his opponents with and whipping up the frenetic crowds at his rallies, many of the people around him were working with highly questionable figures in Putin\u2019s orbit. Trump was so focused on himself and the thrill of the attention he received that he did not understand the underside of his own campaign. There is also a different way to look at the story, which is that many people in the Trump team were just not that perceptive about the world that they had entered. This version of the story would have us think that Donald Trump and Donald Trump Jr., as well as some others in the inner circle, didn\u2019t really understand the dangers of what they were doing or the unsavory intentions of the persons that they surrounded themselves with. In this scenario, it was just another episode of \u201cThe Apprentice\u201d for them, and they didn\u2019t get the problem with accepting invitations such as the one that Donald Jr. received through email. Were the members of the Trump team so enamored with the figures who they met at the Miss Universe competition in 2013, or were they so excited about them as potential business partners to someday construct Trump Tower in Moscow, that they couldn\u2019t understand the difference in the situation once Trump had entered the political arena? The worst-case scenario for the administration, and for the nation, is if Trump knowingly worked with the Russians. Did he build much of his presidential campaign around attacking \u201cCrooked Hillary\u201d and her infamous email server while working in secret to seek assistance from the Russians in winning the presidency or possibly reaping economic benefits for his company? Is the story of the election that, rather than Democrats losing because they couldn\u2019t woo enough working class voters, they lost key states by narrow margins because of meddling by the Russians? In trying to intimidate Robert Mueller, as with Comey before him, is President Trump using Nixonian methods to try to cover up a scandal and shut down an investigation?  Even though he appears via Twitter to be the most transparent president in American history, giving us a live public diary of his thoughts, we don\u2019t yet know who Donald Trump really is. That\u2019s why we have a pretty serious investigation taking place and some very good journalists doing their jobs and trying to uncover the entire story. When we reach a conclusion, if the investigators are able to find everything that they need, we should have an answer to the question. In the meantime, it would benefit the President and his team to stop hiding information and to stop saying things that are blatantly untrue. The Wall Street Journal editorial board has called for Trump to adopt a policy of \u201cradical transparency\u201d if he wants to avoid Democrats taking over Congress in 2018, resulting in impeachment being a \u201cconstant undercurrent if not an active threat.\u201d Rather than attacking the press, Trump should be straightforward about any interactions with the Russians.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Jill Filipovic is a journalist based in New York and Nairobi, Kenya, and the author of the new book \u201cThe H-Spot: The Feminist Pursuit of Happiness.\u201d Follow her on Twitter. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. Jill Filipovic: Column on class divide mocked over passage about intimidating sandwiches She says premise is wrong: GOP's anti-education policies the problem, not liberals In an op-ed Tuesday that quickly went viral, David Brooks of The New York Times took on America\u2019s growing class divide, and the Internet gleefully seized on a passage about his taking a friend with \u201conly a high school degree\u201d to lunch: \u201cInsensitively, I led her into a gourmet sandwich shop. Suddenly I saw her face freeze up as she was confronted with sandwiches named \u2018Padrino\u2019 and \u2018Pomodoro\u2019 and ingredients like soppressata, capicollo and a striata baguette. I quickly asked her if she wanted to go somewhere else and she anxiously nodded yes and we ate Mexican.\u201d Brooks\u2019 column, rightly, pointed out that subtle class clues shape access to power and prosperity in the United States \u2013 something research has borne out. But where Brooks (and many of the other commentators on the much-discussed class divide) gets it wrong is in blaming liberals and progressive coastal culture (sopressata sandwiches, fuel-efficient cars) instead of the cultural resentments and impediments (lack of well-funded public schools, zero paid parental leave) built and bred by the GOP. It\u2019s not Italian cured meats keeping the wealthy and privileged in their gilded position. It\u2019s policy. The 2016 election brought with it a series of disturbing and frightening consequences. One of the sadder ones: Education is now a partisan issue. According to a recent survey from the Pew Research Center, more than half of Republicans say that colleges and universities have \u201ca negative effect on the way things are going in the country.\u201d Van Jones: Both parties have sold out working Americans But the rage working-class whites displayed in November, and the current Republican disdain for higher education, isn\u2019t about expensive charcuterie or uneasiness at being in Whole Foods because, as Brooks frames it, you have to have a college degree to walk into the place. The real story isn\u2019t that the better-educated coastal classes did anything wrong, sandwich-related or otherwise, but that the well-educated, moneyed members of the Republican elite have successfully weaponized white resentment and used it to line their own pockets and maintain their power. Education, in most of the world, is not particularly controversial. It\u2019s widely understood as a valuable social good, and the challenge in many countries is how to get more kids into decent schools. Parents the world over recognize that education is the key to success and upward mobility. Where it is controversial, it\u2019s often a symptom of an extreme religious ideology hell-bent on bringing society back centuries \u2013 think Boko Haram in Nigeria or the Taliban in Afghanistan. Those groups are right about one thing: A little knowledge poses a real danger to authoritarianism and the mindless following of orders. Ivanka Trump is right Which is why the strategy of the GOP has for decades been to degrade the American public education system through funding cuts and funneling of resources toward privatized education. All the better to produce a compliant electorate. At the same time, they\u2019ve perpetuated lies about climate change and undermined public trust in science and objective fact. On the culture side, they\u2019ve tied education to liberalism \u2013 not unfairly, since the highly educated do tend to be more liberal \u2013 and portrayed the educated as elitists who are out of touch with authentic American values (and, apparently, authentic deli meats). This is, of course, reality turned upside down; it\u2019s even more insulting that it\u2019s being branded authentically American. Pursuing personal betterment (through education or other means) is about as American as it gets; so too is innovation, invention and being on the cutting edge of technology, industry and creation \u2013 much of which requires at least some formal education. Trump proposes eliminating after-school program And never mind that the architects of the conservative strategy to dumb down the electorate are themselves highly educated, and reaping its benefits \u2013 our President has a degree from an Ivy League school, as he often reminds his critics. But it\u2019s better to convince the masses that their real enemy is the latte-sipping liberals with their fancy degrees and their \u201cscience,\u201d and not the big-money polluters who turn their communities into \u201ccancer alley.\u201d Sadly, it\u2019s not just the political right that embraces this kind of anti-intellectualism and portrays the values of a small group of people (working-class white men) as more authentic and admirable than the diversity of interests and experiences embraced by others across the rest of the country. In her book \u201cWhite Working Class,\u201d Joan C. Williams argues that coastal liberals making disparaging comments about \u201cplumber butt\u201d caused our current cultural divide. The far left is doing it, too, in its knee-jerk anti-liberalism \u2013 it\u2019s not the corporate GOP and its reactionary base that\u2019s the problem, this argument goes, it\u2019s liberal technocrats, who have the audacity to rely on things such as education, expertise and data to drive policy. It\u2019s a sad state of affairs when one of the most prosperous nations on earth doesn\u2019t ask, \u201cHow can we give every person in this country greater access to education and the information, critical thinking skills, social mobility and higher paying jobs that come with it?\u201d but instead looks at the best educated among us as a problem: inherently flawed and inauthentic, elitist instead of aspirational. America, we still have a jobs problem There remain significant formal barriers to a decent education at the primary, secondary and collegiate levels in the United States \u2013 barriers we could easily tear down with greater resources and investments of money, time and professionalism. Pointing the finger at educated liberals and our alleged elitism does nothing to address the problem. Education doesn\u2019t necessarily make you smarter, although, hopefully, it makes you more knowledgeable, and shapes you into a more careful thinker. Active hostility to education, on the other hand, and political policies that reflect that antagonism, make our entire country dumber.",

The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. Julian Zelizer: If Democrats want to win elections again, they need to heed the words of Bernie Sanders Instead of just trash-talking Trump, they must form a stronger message to broaden their reach, he says Senator Bernie Sanders still thinks that the Democrats don\u2019t get it. Speaking Saturday in Chicago, Sanders offered some blistering rhetoric, calling on his supporters to take down President Trump, who he believes to be a threat to the nation. But he also told a packed auditorium that targeting Trump was not enough. \u201cI am often asked by the media and others, \u2018How did it come about that Donald Trump, the most unpopular presidential candidate in the modern history of our country, won the election?\u2019\u201d Sanders said.  \u201cMy answer is that Trump didn\u2019t win the election \u2013 the Democratic Party lost the election.\u201d The senator\u2019s warning to Democrats is extraordinarily important at this moment. While Republicans control the White House and Congress, Democrats are in a surprisingly good position. They face a Republican President whose term has been consumed by an ongoing scandal that keeps getting worse. His approval numbers are in the 30s and continue to fall. Congressional Republicans have had trouble moving any signature legislation, and the bills they have managed to get through one chamber, such as health care, have made the party and president less popular. Midterm elections almost always go poorly for the party in power, and polls suggest that the 2018 midterms might fit the pattern. Yet the danger for Democrats is that they lose sight of a basic problem the party has faced: the need for a stronger message to energize their base and broaden their reach. The risk for Democrats is that, like the rest of the nation, they become so consumed by the chaos in Washington that they don\u2019t devote any attention to cleaning up their own house and preparing for the next set of elections. As Frank Bruni asks in The New York Times in looking at the town of Halcottsville in the 19th Congressional District of New York, \u201cWill Democrats put forward the right candidate for a largely working-class region whose barns need paint, whose town centers want for bustle and whose manufacturing plants are too few and far between?\u201d So far President Trump\u2019s term has given Democrats a massive opening. The choices that he has made about public policy \u2013 deregulating energy and financial markets, draconian health care changes that would leave millions of Americans with less health care coverage, a supply-side tax cut that would most benefit upper income Americans and the utter absence of a serious jobs policy \u2013 have exposed the weaknesses and limitations of \u201cconservative populism.\u201d Why the GOP is stuck in neutral President Trump\u2019s fiery rhetoric belied the history of Republican politics in recent decades, which has not done much to benefit middle- and working-class Americans. Although Trump promised to be different, he is not. Democrats, though, can\u2019t just say that President Trump is no good. In his most recent tweet, Trump said, \u201cThe Democrats have no message, not on economics, not on taxes, not on jobs, not on failing #Obamacare.\u201d In response to this kind of attack that Republicans are likely to level against them in the years to come, Democrats must make a convincing case that their party actually has something to say about the ongoing economic insecurity that afflicts middle-class communities in a moment of low unemployment. Some Democrats, such as New York Governor Andrew Cuomo, have tried to build on Sanders\u2019 appeal with new policy initiatives such as free higher education. But state initiatives are not enough. National Democrats need to do more to outline and promote a robust domestic agenda that will reframe the midterm campaigns of 2018 and the presidential campaign of 2020. They have to demonstrate that they are a party that is not, in fact, beholden to big interests, as Sanders has argued, and has a vision that will translate into real economic gains for all Americans. It will be vital that Democrats take these steps without dismissing the important issues that the party has embraced since the 1960s. Too many critics of the party reflexively blamed \u201cidentity\u201d issues such as feminism and civil rights as the reason that Democrats like Hillary Clinton lost. That too would be a big mistake. Actually, Hillary Clinton makes a good -- and awkward -- point Rather than downplay questions such as criminal justice reform or equal pay, Democrats need to work harder to explain to voters why these are not \u201cbase\u201d issues and why their agenda better responds to the concerns of the electorate living in red and blue states. They also need to make a more compelling case that only by dealing with issues such as sexism in the workplace or racism in policing can the nation actually craft policies that make all middle- and working-class Americans feel more secure about their futures. Nor can Democrats leave foreign policy and national security on the sidelines. The problems that existed during President Obama\u2019s term \u2013 the growth of ISIS, the expansion of Russian cyber and military aggression, and the turmoil in Syria \u2013 have cost the party considerable support among voters who fear for the stability of the international order. The ease of criticizing President Trump\u2019s inchoate and stumbling moves around the globe do not excuse Democrats from coming up with a doctrine of their own. President Trump has an ability to take up all the oxygen in the room. By the time his era of scandal, controversy and bombast comes to an end, many politicians in both parties won\u2019t even remember what they were planning to do when they went to work. The newsrooms are likewise so obsessed with Trump that it becomes extraordinarily difficult to give airtime to anything else. A majority of Americans probably are not aware, for instance, that several trials will take place over the next few weeks of police officers who were caught on tape killing African Americans. These were videotaped acts that shook the nation\u2019s conscience last year but today barely receive a second of notice.  Democrats can\u2019t fell prey to this trap. Otherwise they won\u2019t be able to capitalize on this situation and navigate the political and policy challenges that will arise once President Trump is gone. Historically, political parties thrive when they go through a process of self-examination and learn to better address policies they had ignored at a cost. In the 1930s, Franklin Roosevelt and congressional Democrats put forth a robust vision of using government in response to economic depression that revolutionized the role of the state in American life. Democrats now face a similar kind of political crossroads. Whether they learn from 2016 and develop a more exciting set of policies, rather than coasting through 2018 on an anti-Trump message, will have as much impact on the party\u2019s future as Trump\u2019s fate in the months ahead.",

He was a speechwriter to ex-British Prime Minister Tony Blair and was communications director to former Australian Prime Minister Julia Gillard. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. \u201cIt\u2019s like a choice between the plague and cholera.\u201d The French phrase for a lack of any real options is more powerful than its English equivalent \u2013 \u201ca plague on both your houses\u201d \u2013 partly because it is less familiar but mainly because it expresses such disgust. I heard it said in focus groups before the recent French presidential election. But it really seems far more appropriate when being used to describe the UK general election, where both parties seem to have set their controls for defeat. What do you think the UK's place in the world should be? The Tories are likely to end up being the most surprising losers of this election. Electorally, they have been the most successful party in Western Europe since the 19th century. They appeared to have lost their mojo when Tony Blair \u2013 you may have heard of him \u2013 led New Labour to three election victories in a row: 1997, 2001 and 2005. Despite having regained the habit of winning in 2010 and 2015, the Tories, under their current leader and Prime Minister Theresa May, seem to have lost their way again. This snap election \u2013 which May called to deliver a mandate to push through her own vision of Brexit and give her a massive parliamentary majority, wiping out any opposition \u2013 has misfired from the first. To start with, there was her slogan: \u201cStrong and stable.\u201d Clearly intended to provide a contrast with the public\u2019s perception of opposition leader Jeremy Corbyn \u2013 who has a highly unusual history for someone running to be prime minister \u2013 it ran into immediate problems. Since taking over from David Cameron in the wake of the Brexit vote, May had strongly and repeatedly ruled out an early election: \u201cI\u2019m not going to be calling a snap election. I\u2019ve been very clear that I think we need that period of time, that stability, to be able to deal with the issues that the country is facing and have that election in 2020.\u201d While May could have got away with flip-flopping on this single issue, she had already proposed and dropped an increase in National Insurance \u2013 a payroll tax \u2013 in her first budget. Apparently not satisfied with merely damaging her \u201cstrong and stable\u201d image, May then proceeded to torpedo it. On the day of the Tory manifesto launch, her flagship policy was a plan to shift the burden of social care for older people onto those with large property assets. It was quickly labeled a \u201cdementia tax\u201d by the managing editor of the Conservative-supporting Spectator magazine and former Tory speechwriter, Will Heaven. He wasn\u2019t the only Conservative angered by the policy. It was also met with incredulity among Tory activists and hostility from Tory voters on the doorstep. Then it was dropped. Soon after, the Tory poll lead began to drop. May\u2019s arrogant assumption that Corbyn\u2019s unpopularity with the public translated to her own popularity had backfired. Under normal circumstances, such a catastrophic campaign would be an opportunity for an opposition party hungry for government. May is lucky that in Corbyn, she faces a man who never misses an opportunity to miss an opportunity. Elections are won in the center, so Corbyn unhesitatingly ran as far to the left as possible. He created a clear distinction between Labour and the Conservatives with plans to hike taxes, nationalize large parts of the economy and increase public spending as far as the eye can see. This was not so much a Labour Party manifesto as an anti-Blair one. (Corbyn has been a long-term critic of his own party\u2019s only election-winning Prime Minister in a generation.) It appears to have had the desired effect. On current estimates, even the most optimistic polls don\u2019t put Corbyn in Downing  Street. Though the manifesto went down well with his base, it is unlikely to win over the alienated white working-class voters that any Labour Party needs to win an election. The world has lost interest in British politics In a bizarre mirror image of May\u2019s campaign, Corbyn wanted to ensure he could not profit from her errors. To turn Michelle Obama\u2019s famous phrase on its head, when she went low, he went low. So, having made clear he was offering tax and spend rather than economic security, Corbyn then did little to dissuade fears of his commitment to renew the Trident nuclear deterrent. This was foolish, considering one of the major Tory attack lines on him has been questioning his ability to protect national security. The leaders of both parties have worked tirelessly to lose \u2013 and it\u2019s likely that both still will. May has permanently lost the authority she gained when she was the lone surviving figure after the Jacobean revenge tragedy of a Tory leadership election triggered by Cameron\u2019s resignation. Corbyn has thrown away an election that almost any other senior Labour figure could probably have won. Faced with what columnist Iain Martin called the \u201cworst (Conservative) general election campaign since before the war. By which I mean the First World War,\u201d Corbyn has done everything to ensure that May cannot not lose, however hard she tries. Maybe he\u2019s seen this movie before \u2013 he doesn\u2019t want to be the dog that catches the car. His project is to drag the Labour Party further and further to the left, not to run the country . Where does this end? Who can tell? When does it end? That is easier to say. Both leaders are tragically \u2013 for country and respective parties \u2013 unassailable. Watch this space. But you can be forgiven for watching from behind your sofa. Ahead of the British election, we want to know: What do you think the UK\u2019s place in the world should be? Call us and leave a message. Your response could be used on CNN.",

He serves as the Chairman of the House Freedom Caucus and on the Oversight and Government Reform and Foreign Affairs committees. The views expressed in this commentary are solely his own. Mark Meadows: Washington's priorities are not aligned with America's Politicians should be addressing the immediate economic concerns There is a simple reality that often seems lost on many inside the Beltway: The priorities of the mainstream media and Washington elites are not those of the American people. If you\u2019ve watched cable news any given day since President Donald Trump\u2019s inauguration, you\u2019ve been subjected to near-hysterical coverage of the latest \u201cscandal\u201d that threatens to doom his presidency. You\u2019ve probably seen pundits, analysts and politicians relentlessly deliver talking points on why Trump is unfit to be President \u2013 or even why he should be impeached. Yet here we are, six months into President Trump\u2019s term, and many Americans have grown weary of the constant media frenzy regarding his administration. And those who voted for the President continue to support him. This principle might seem shocking to Washington, but average Americans \u2013 many of whom I spoke with while campaigning for then candidate Trump \u2013 will tell you that they could care less about the latest Washington cable news drama. Rather, what they care about are policies that impact their families, their pocket books and their everyday lives. Political media and DC elites often forget that the average American family is struggling to save for the future \u2013 and in fact almost half couldn\u2019t cover an unforeseen $400 expense. Despite the fact that millions of men and women across this country are working second and third jobs, they are struggling to feed their families. Those Americans \u2013 from Western North Carolina to Ohio to Pennsylvania to Michigan \u2013 aren\u2019t focused on the latest breaking \u201cnews\u201d on the Russia investigation. They care about seeing results and solutions that help their businesses survive \u2013 and grow. They care about having access to high quality, affordable health care. They care about lower taxes that allow them to keep more of their paychecks. They care about the safety and security of their family. Why Washington is leaking like a sieve And, in Washington, we have done an abysmal job of maintaining our primary focus on those issues. Passing important policy that impacts every day Americans requires consensus building, marketing our ideas to constituents through media and building coalitions of support. With the constant focus on Russia, big important policy items like tax reform have been stalled. Now, make no mistake, it\u2019s critical that we not gloss over any potential wrongdoing in the Russia investigation. If there were improper activities, we need to get to the bottom of the issue \u2013 and no one will be more committed to getting to the truth on a bipartisan basis than I will. At the same time, congressional investigations have to follow a deliberative process that takes time. I\u2019ve conducted oversight of government agencies and officials for the last five years as a member and a subcommittee chairman on the Oversight and Government Reform Committee. I\u2019ve investigated cases ranging from the Fast and Furious gun-running scandal to the IRS targeting scandal to the Benghazi attack where Americans lost their lives. In all of these cases, we had a deliberative process that spanned months \u2013 and in some cases, years \u2013 to collect proper evidence, interview key witnesses and see where the facts led. And, in some instances, the facts didn\u2019t lead anywhere, and the cases were dropped. Trump voters speak out on Russia probe (full) Congress has a duty to hold government officials accountable when necessary, but it is counterproductive for the media and some of my Democrat colleagues to throw unsubstantiated claims regarding White House officials against a wall repeatedly to see what sticks. Media and political hysterics work in opposition to \u2013 not in favor of \u2013 getting to truth and transparency. Furthermore, while foreign interference in our election is something that our republic cannot and should not tolerate, it seems a bit ludicrous to suggest that tens of millions of Americans made a choice for president based on Russian influence. This is evidenced by the fact that President Trump continues to share the support of a plurality of Americans who believe they made the right choice for president \u2013 because they voted for his agenda. America must not tolerate Russian intervention in our elections, but we must also not perpetuate a narrative that suggests a far bigger role than any evidence has proven. Fueling exaggeration and constant hysteria is something that could unravel a democracy like ours. It\u2019s time we let the special counsel do his job and allow Congress to focus on actually on doing ours. Let\u2019s also remember that through the frenzy, no formal charge has been leveled against anyone in the administration, no direct evidence uncovered and no evidence of collusion between the Trump campaign and Russia confirmed. This is nothing warranting wall-to-wall speculation from the pundit class. The hysterics surrounding Russia merely serve to distract from accomplishing the priorities of the American people \u2013 and for what, partisan gain?  There is real work to be done for the American people. Much of it can and should be possible to accomplish on a bipartisan basis. Now is not the time to circle the partisan wagons, but a time to deliver on the commitments we made to the American people. We need to deliver on undoing the harmful regulatory environment that stifles businesses, reforming the tax code to leave more money in the pockets of hard working Americans, replacing our broken health care system with one that will bring down premiums for American families and properly supporting our men and women in uniform. It\u2019s time Congress and the media redirect their attention to those same principles. Let\u2019s focus on the American peoples\u2019 true priorities \u2013 the Main Street issues that matter.",

Franken, the former \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d comedian and best-selling author, is no political joke. He comes to the table with substantial political experience, certainly compared to President Donald Trump. When reporter Bill Scher floated Franken in Politico as a possibility to be Hillary Clinton\u2019s vice presidential running mate, many readers were intrigued by the idea but they wondered \u2013 could a former comedian and Deadhead who partook in the 1970s \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d party scene really be viable as a national candidate? The answer is yes. As Franken travels around the country to promote his new book about life in the Senate, \u201cAl Franken: Giant of the Senate,\u201d Americans are getting a closer look at him. What are some of the qualities that make the Minnesota Democrat a viable candidate? Unlike many of his colleagues, Franken is a tough partisan. Facing a Republican Party that hits hard and often beneath the belt, Franken has shown repeatedly that he is willing to punch back. This is a necessity in contemporary politics that too many Democrats have shied away from. Why Washington is leaking like a sieve Democrats have been part of a perpetual quest to achieve civility and temper partisan passions even when the Republicans move further to the right, becoming more aggressive and more confrontational in their willingness to tear down opponents. If the Democrats are going to be competitive, they need a candidate like Franken who is willing to be explicit and direct about his political feelings. Franken understands what much of the modern Republican Party is made of. Before running for the Senate, he published a blistering book about the right-wing media and its connections to the Republican Party entitled \u201cLies and the Lying Liars Who Tell Them: A Fair and Balanced Look at the Right.\u201d Published in 2003, the book got to the heart of contemporary conservatism before many other observers were willing to acknowledge the ways in which the party was changing. \u201cThe members of the right-wing media are not interested in conveying the truth,\u201d he wrote. \u201cThey are an indispensable component of the right-wing machine that has taken over the country \u2026 We have to fight back. We have to expose those who bear false witness for the false witness bearers that they are.\u201d His willingness to directly challenge powerful Republicans has been clear in the way he\u2019s been talking about Sen. Ted Cruz during his book tour. The book contains a chapter all about Cruz and the problems he causes in the Senate. During one interview on CNN, Cruz came up as a subject in the discussion. \u201cI probably like Ted Cruz more than most of my other colleagues like Ted Cruz,\u201d he said, \u201cand I hate Ted Cruz.\u201d Franken half-jokingly described his fellow senator as the \u201ctoxic guy in an office, the guy who microwaves fish.\u201d On a more serious note, he said, \u201cTed doesn\u2019t get anything done. His big accomplishment was shutting down the government.\u201d He doesn\u2019t confuse personal bipartisan civility, of which he is capable, with the need to agree or even try to agree on policy \u2013 something that will offer welcome relief to critics of President Obama who believe that he disastrously bent over backward to compromise with Republicans who would never say yes. Writing about former Sen. Jeff Sessions, whose wife knit Franken\u2019s grandson a blanket, he is firm about the danger Sessions presents to civil rights in his new job as attorney general. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to unfairly demonize someone whose wife knit your grandson his favorite blankie. Which is why when my job meant doing everything in my power to deny my friend this important position, I was relieved that there was so much to fairly demonize him for.\u201d Now he is at the forefront of the Russia investigation, accusing Sessions of having committed perjury. Explaining his feelings about President Trump, Franken does not hold back. He writes: \u201cWatching Donald J. Trump take the oath of office to become the 45th President of the United States was perhaps the most depressing moment I\u2019ve had since I entered politics, although that record has been repeatedly suppressed since January 20.\u201d Democrats also need a candidate like Sen. Franken who can handle the art of political combat within the new frenetic cable and Internet media environment. These are not easy mediums to handle, as so many politicians have learned. Successful politicians need a great feel for the way that the 24-hour news cycle works and how to respond \u2013 as well as to shape \u2013 the narratives that take form and are remade in our era of breaking news. They need to be comfortable in the sometimes silly and unreal conversation that can take place in print and on the airwaves. Like it or not, this is the media landscape that we have. Franken is comfortable playing in this sandbox. His skills as a comedian and an entertainer would come in handy in a presidential campaign, and in governing, as they have during his time in the Senate. Comedians are not just funny but they are brutally honest about themselves, a characteristic that voters seem to be yearning for. You don\u2019t have to be perfect as a person, but much of the electorate does want someone who\u2019s real. Franken, a Harvard graduate, is no lightweight. He is not just one more entertainer who wants to make his way into the world of politics (aka the Rock). His service in the Senate will distinguish him from many other candidates who are not quite inside the party establishment. Franken is an outsider who is on the inside. Elected in 2008, he represents a major state in the heartland. During his time in the Senate he has proven his ability to be a tough interrogator, taking the legislative oversight function seriously, and he pushed a number of important bills, such as legislation in his first year mandating how health insurance premiums should be spent. Actually, Hillary Clinton makes a good -- and awkward -- point To be sure, he doesn\u2019t have a huge record of sponsored bills that were passed, but this is not a surprise, given that Republicans have controlled the chamber for much of his time in office and we have had very unproductive congressional sessions as a whole. Franken is an old-fashioned economic liberal with socially progressive sensibilities. As he writes in his new book, \u201cDemocrats aren\u2019t just the party of equality for all \u2013 we\u2019re the party of opportunity for all. We\u2019re the ones who want to give people the boots. We\u2019re the ones who stand for the middle class and for those aspiring to it \u2013 not just because it\u2019s the fair thing to do, but because it\u2019s the smart thing to do.\u201d The senator has won elections in the kind of state Democrats need to pay closer attention to: Minnesota. Franken has done well with Midwestern heartland voters who used to be the heart of the Democratic coalition. As the Democrats have focused their energy on the coasts, they\u2019ve lost touch with too many white middle class and working class voters who are struggling in these regions. Franken has proven that he can win here, appealing to them with economic issues rather than crass conservative populism that plays to their anger. In his 2014 bid for re-election, Sen. Franken won the support of non-college educated voters by eight points. His personal story offers Democrats a mix of a politician who can appeal to the coastal political sensibilities and working class voters in the heartland. Franken is the grandchild of immigrants, he was educated in the Ivy League, and he is a Midwestern liberal. Bringing varied elements of the party together and building on the demographic advantages that are forming for Democrats, a Franken campaign could pose a threat to the GOP. Franken would be the first Jewish American president if elected.  Although there are skeptics who wonder whether this admitted former cocaine user and partier can win. But it does seem that Trump\u2019s victory has changed the rules of the game. Trump\u2019s own background in the nightclubs of New York and his scandalous personal record with women didn\u2019t stop him. To be sure, Franken still needs to be tested. We don\u2019t how he would handle the media spotlight when it intensifies dramatically and how opponents would assail aspects of his biography. But there is a lot for Democrats to like in this funny man turned politician. The party should take a close look at this senator to see if there is someone fresher and with new perspectives who might be a perfect fit to run in the era of Trump. Sen. Franken, whose party is \u201ctired and broken,\u201d to quote the Grateful Dead, might very well need him to take this leap.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Krystal Ball is the executive director and founder of the People\u2019s House Project, an initiative to elect more Democrats in Midwestern and Appalachian states, and author of \u201cReversing the Apocalypse: Hijacking the Democratic Party to Save the World.\u201d Ball is a former Virginia congressional candidate and a current resident of Kentucky. The views expressed in this commentary are her own. Krystal Ball: After Democrats lost the special election in Montana, is it even clearer that the party has a branding problem Democrats come off as elitist, and they need to start putting up candidates who can connect with working-class voters, writes Ball Another special-election loss, this time in Montana, has kicked off a round of soul searching and excuse making in the Democratic Party. Sure, this loss came in a state that Trump won by 20-plus points. Sure, we outperformed based on the partisan makeup of the state. But the fact remains, we lost to a candidate who allegedly assaulted a reporter on the eve of the election. We lost to a candidate who embraced our deeply flawed President. We lost to a candidate who, quite simply, should have been unelectable. Why? Because as terrible as Trump is, and as bad as assaulting a reporter may be, none of this compares to the Democratic Party\u2019s awful job at branding its message and its messengers. Right now, our party has about the same level of credibility as Donald Trump. We claim to be fighting for middle- and working-class people, but it is obvious to all that our priorities lie first and foremost with the wealthy donors we rely on to fund our campaigns. This reality has eroded our moral standing and impacts the way our party operates at every level. Just consider the ads that Republican Greg Gianforte ran against Democratic hopeful Rob Quist. In them, a narrator informs viewers that Quist may talk folksy, but he\u2019s really just \u201cNancy Pelosi in a cowboy hat.\u201d This ad sends the message that Quist is just as tied to the donor class, just as beholden to special interests, just as bereft of ideas and just as condescending to the struggles of ordinary Americans as a distant, dreaded, unaccountable elite. Montana body-slam reveals a GOP problem And while Pelosi may connote liberalism to many, in much of the country, her brand is quite the opposite \u2013 reflecting an elitism that can hurt Democrats on Election Day. The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC) took a lot of heat for not investing more in Quist\u2019s race and then had an \u201cI told you so moment\u201d after his loss, saying it \u201crefused to waste money on hype.\u201d And in a sense, perhaps, the DCCC is right. Even when running against a candidate as dreadful as Gianforte, given the current brand of the Democratic Party, a special election in Montana is a lost cause. What they miss, however, is that this type of fatalism will consign us to defeat in most of the country. So how do we repair and restore the Democratic Party brand? It\u2019s clear that if we want to change where we are able to win, we need to change who we are running, how we are running and what we are running on. Let\u2019s start with the candidates we get behind. Because of our loyalty to the donor class, we recruit and support candidates based not on their character or connections to their communities, but on their ability to raise money. It will not surprise you that this is a less than optimal selection process. We would be better served running teachers, firefighters, nurses and local labor leaders who can actually speak with authority to the working and middle-class experience. Because the working class is substantially more diverse than the country as a whole, this would also naturally lead to more diversity among our leadership ranks. Paul Ryan responds to Gianforte's altercation One of the reasons we have become obsessed with candidate fundraising prowess is because we have accepted conventional wisdom that the most important element in a campaign is money. We have accepted the guidance of the consultant industrial complex, which tells candidates the only way they can run credibly is by spending tens of thousands of dollars on preprinted mail pieces to get thrown in the garbage and hundreds of thousands of dollars on TV ads that most people will fast forward through. It\u2019s time to reassess these assumptions. Did Hillary Clinton lose because she didn\u2019t have enough money? Will Jon Ossoff win if we just throw another million dollars at his race? No. And if Jon Ossoff wins in Georgia, it will be because people were enthusiastic about him as a candidate. It will be because they showed up to knock on their neighbors\u2019 doors and made the effort on Election Day to wake up early or get home late so they could cast ballots. The biggest single thing we have going for us right now is the enthusiasm of people who are horrified by what they see happening to our country. Rather than outsourcing campaigns to D.C. consultants, harness that enthusiasm. We need to ask ourselves how much more receptive we would be to reading a handwritten letter from a neighbor rather than a preprinted postcard? How much more attention would we pay to a person knocking on our door than yet another annoying political TV ad? We could be running more effective races on a lot less money and go a long way toward rebuilding our credibility as a party of the people. Tapper: If you can't condemn an assault on a reporter, reexamine your love for Constitution The last thing we need to do, though, is the most critical. Resistance to Donald Trump is not enough. Ultimately, people won\u2019t show up to fight or vote if they aren\u2019t inspired by our vision. But no individual congressional candidate can create a large national vision \u2013 that has to come from the party. On this measure, we have utterly failed. As I write in my book, our nation has undergone a massive economic shift that has left more and more Americans balancing precariously on low-paying, unstable service work. Three of the most common jobs in the country are cashier, sales clerk and food service worker. Not only is it impossible to raise a family on the wages from these jobs, but all three are threatened in the near term by automation. We talk about lifting the minimum wage, but let\u2019s be clear, this is palliative care for the middle class at best. What solutions have we offered to restore an economy where American workers can prosper? What vision have we laid out to address the seismic changes that are as large as the Industrial Revolution, but happening at the speed of the Internet? You offer people those answers, and you\u2019ll have plenty of grassroots donations to run winning campaigns. None of this can be done overnight or with one congressional campaign. But over time, if we continue to back candidates who are dissonant with the current brand of the party, run creative and authentic campaigns and detox from Wall Street and Silicon Valley contributions, we can compete everywhere.  And we can make sure that the unelectable, like Gianforte, stay unelected. Because the truth is that we are the party of the people. The current White House occupant and the enabling Republican Party have demonstrated time and again that their allegiance lies only with the rich in this country. And we have no choice but to try. The alternative is accepting the creeping fatalism offered by the DCCC and crossing a few more states off the list of places where we can credibly compete. I, for one, refuse to go out without a fight.",

The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. Julian Zelizer: The party in the White House usually suffers a big defeat in midterm elections, but factors could hinder a Democratic sweep Good economic numbers could outweigh the impact of voter anger at losing health benefits, he writes Gamblers are likely betting on Democrats to do quite well in the 2018 midterm elections. Historically, the party of the president gets a shellacking, as President Obama called it in 2010, in the first midterm that they face. There have been only two cases when the president\u2019s party gained in both houses of Congress since the Civil War: in 1934 and in 2002. Besides the normal historical cycle of backlash against the White House, Democrats this time around are whetting their lips because House Republicans have just voted for a health care bill that rescinds benefits for millions of hard-working Americans. This could prove to be a policy victory that ends in political defeat. Between the midterms\u2019 track record and the polarizing health care legislation, this week\u2019s events would seem to be a recipe for political disaster for the GOP. Democrats, on the other hand, see a silver lining in the House vote. They are hoping that TrumpCare will become the Republican ObamaCare, producing the same flip of control of the House that Democrats suffered in 2010. Obama's legacy is in jeopardy According to David Wasserman of the Cook Report, one of the shrewdest political observers around, the vote \u201cguarantees Democrats will have at least one major on-the-record vote to exploit in the next elections.\u201d And according to one Republican political strategist who deeply dislikes the president, \u201cWhat we\u2019ve done here is political malpractice. Democrats will run ads with weeping parents who can\u2019t cover their premiums and Little Johnny dying \u2026\u201d But is a Democratic sweep in 2018 really so certain? Is it so obvious that Republicans are on the verge of total electoral disaster? The answers are not as clear as they might seem.  Despite the House vote, President Trump and the GOP are looking at some pretty good economic numbers today. With the economy having reached full employment, the best conditions in more than 10 years, many voters will be in good spirits about the status quo. Notwithstanding all the talk about the impact of the health care legislation, the bottom line to Americans\u2019 pocketbooks will matter a great deal come the midterm campaigns. If conditions don\u2019t change significantly, Republicans will benefit. President Trump and the GOP, whether they deserve it or not, will be able to claim credit for the recovery.  (Presidents usually get the blame or credit for economic conditions, even if they don\u2019t have a big impact on them.) Republicans will say that indeed he is making America great again. Trump\u2019s supporters will feel that he delivered. Many Republicans who never loved Trump will nevertheless be pleased with the state of economic affairs. The battle to end Obamacare is just getting started There has been much discussion about the current version of the House bill and its \u201closers\u201d who will make their angry voices known. But there are winners as well who will support what the GOP has done: wealthy Americans whose taxes will be lower, upper-middle-class Americans without pre-existing conditions, younger middle-class people who don\u2019t want insurance or want more meager insurance, and large employers who don\u2019t face the the mandate to offer coverage as they did under Obamacare. To be sure, Republican candidates will face the ire of hospitals, Medicaid recipients and elderly Americans who are furious about the impact of the reform, if it passes. But this is not a bill that only takes things away from voters. Indeed, the bill redistributes benefits to some very powerful sectors of the country. The benefits of winning in politics are important. If a health care measure gets through the Senate, Republican voters will be energized about a watershed victory. On the campaign trail, Republicans will have something to brag about when discussing what they have achieved in the Trump Era. It is also very possible that passing health care would open to doors to a major supply-side tax cut that would bolster the confidence of core Republican constituencies who have money to spend on campaigns.  Democrats who are counting on a backlash to Trumpcare should also be careful not to forget that we live in a political world where public perceptions of policy and government are not simply the product of rational calculations by voters. They learned this in the 2016 election but seem to have forgot the lesson. Partisan forces, ranging from the president to biased media outlets, can have a profound impact on how voters interpret what is happening in the political world. Republicans have proven to be enormously successful at shaping the narrative about government decisions and policy. President Trump is a master of spin. As the impact of a health care bill becomes clear, statistics won\u2019t be the only thing that matters. Democrats will have to counteract the powerful public relations campaign that President Trump and Republicans will certainly mount to convince voters that all the positives in health care are a product of their efforts and all the problems are still legacies of President Obama\u2019s broken policies. The midterms are more than 18 months away, and a lot can happen to shape how they will play out. Trump's tour to the seats of three religions Yet Republicans can still count on gerrymandered districts to protect incumbents in a large part of the red map. While courts have forced some states to redraw districts put into place after 2010, many of them remain in place for 2018. With the largest GOP majority in the House since 1928, it won\u2019t be easy for Democrats to retake control of Congress. Democrats will have some heavy lifting to do, even with history on their side. In the Senate, as CNN\u2019s Chris Cilizza recently wrote, Democrats must defend 25 seats. The Republicans are defending only eight. Ten of the states Democrats need to protect are in states that Donald Trump won. In North Dakota, Missouri, Montana, West Virginia and Indiana, he won by whopping margins. Nor is it likely that the House bill will be the final legislation. Senate Republicans are already toying with a number of changes, such as boosting tax credits for low-income Americans or delaying the end of the Medicaid expansion that would make the bill more politically palatable in the short-term.  If they do, and Freedom Caucus Republicans in the House decide that they need to deliver some kind of legislation, even if flawed, this could fundamentally change the dynamics of how the bill is perceived in the near future. The reality is that Democrats should not be too giddy about the recent vote and their prospects come 2018. It will be a long slog to retake control of Congress and even to put a significant dent in the size of the Republican majorities. And Republicans can make a credible case that they will retain control of Congress and carry out more of their conservative agenda in the years ahead.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Timothy Stanley is a historian and columnist for Britain\u2019s Daily Telegraph. He is the author of \u201cCitizen Hollywood: How the Collaboration Between LA and DC Revolutionized American Politics.\u201d The opinions expressed in this commentary are his. Wednesday at 9 p.m. ET, CNN hosts a town hall with Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price, moderated by Wolf Blitzer and Dana Bash. Timothy Stanley: Reality is that high coverage and low costs are contradictory aims The \"something for everyone\" philosophy does not translate well into government Health care reform could mark the first serious legislative crisis for Trumpism. President Donald Trump exploited anger at Obamacare to get elected \u2013 that was smart. His mistake was to promise to replace it with something that would deliver the best of everything: high coverage, low costs. Trump attacked Obamacare on the campaign trail, but not for any coherently conservative reasons. His goal, unlike that of orthodox conservatives, was never to shrink government for the sake of shrinking government, but rather to redirect its resources towards his people, his kind of Americans. Obamacare should be repealed, he said, but with the caveat that it had to be replaced by something that would be both cheap and cover the working class. That\u2019s what he ran on, that\u2019s what he won on. The reality is that high coverage and low costs are contradictory aims. The Congressional Budget Office suggests that attempting both will result in neither: its analysis of the Republicans\u2019 American Health Care Act (AHCA) says that 24 million more people will be uninsured by 2026 and that some older citizens\u2019 premiums will jump. Turns out that you can have bread, you can have circuses, but you can\u2019t have both. This drama has a long history. Back in 2009, when Obamacare was first put to Congress, the Republicans leapt on the Tea Party bandwagon. This was a natural alliance between anxious consumers and conservatives who feared that getting the government even more involved in health care would lead to higher prices. They were right to worry. Just days before the 2016 election, it was announced that Obamacare premiums were rising by an average of 25%. In many counties of Arizona, for example, there was only one provider on the Obamacare exchanges left, and costs were reported to have more than doubled. GOP health plan: Bad news for the old and poor Now Trump is facing the real problem, which is that his \u201csomething for everyone\u201d philosophy does not translate well into government, particularly a government running out of cash. Trump has demanded from Congress a huge tax cut and a massive increase in defense spending. Money will have to be saved, but how? Step forward Paul Ryan with the AHCA, which at its heart is an attempt to make Obamacare more economical rather than abolish it altogether. It\u2019s a first step, say its defenders, one that will still keep a lot of poor people covered, cut out rules that stifle competition, raise a few costs to improve the fiscal position and cut $337 billion over 10 years. A nice nip and tuck. Isn\u2019t that what Republicans want? No. Not the moderate Republicans who represent constituencies with small majorities, at least. How can they possibly support an act that either fails to insure their voters or causes their premiums to rise \u2013 even if, as the Congressional Budget Office assessed, they might eventually fall again? To keep the support of Trumpite, working-class voters, they urge moderation. But moderation, in turn, will alienate the conservative Republicans \u2013 in Congress and elsewhere \u2013 who despise the AHCA because they see it as an imitation of Obamacare. The conservatives have a point. The AHCA is a reform that goes far enough to hurt people without going far enough to make things better. A CBO report that conservatives can get behind The conservative Republican argument is that only when the government liberalizes the market and empowers consumers with lower taxes \u2013 will the costs of health care fall. Greater coverage, they argue, is best achieved through health care becoming so cheap \u2013 thanks to competition \u2013 that anyone can afford it. The tragedy of American health care is cost. Consumers are charged crazy amounts and have little power to do anything about it. The socialist solution, which is practiced in Britain, is for the government to take complete control of health care and regulate prices. The free market solution would be to get government out of health care altogether; let healthy competition drive down bills. Obamacare is part of a long tradition of the US stumbling between socialism and the free market, delivering not the best of both worlds but, very often, the worst. Instead of bringing the costs of the health care market down, the US system now subsidizes consumers who would otherwise struggle to afford its products. With the Republicans in control, now ought to be the best time to enact a total reform of health care \u2013 but it looks like it won\u2019t happen. Partly because of worries about alienating the voters and because Republicans like Ryan aren\u2019t on board with a fully free market approach. But also because the logic of Trump-style populism has limited the conversation. Rather than challenge the philosophy behind Obamacare, Trump really only challenged its implementation. He was a candidate for a more generous version of the status quo, and his populist approach threw away an enormous opportunity to rethink the underlying principles of how American health care operates.  The most damning irony is that in trying to serve as many masters as it can, the AHCA is alienating almost everyone. Rather than each constituency group seeing something they want in it, they see only the things that are missing. And this is an important point that Trump will come to learn in time: even if bad policy is popular on the campaign trail, it is guaranteed eventually to become unpopular in government. Trump is correct, health care is \u201cunbelievably complex\u201d \u2013 too complex, I suspect, to be reformed by a populist.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Jonathan Tasini (@jonathantasini) has been a frequent commentator on CNN. He is the author of \u201cThe Essential Bernie Sanders and His Vision for America,\u201d president of the Economic Future Group and the host of the \u201cWorking Life\u201d podcast. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. Jonathan Tasini: TPP was already dead as a doornail, so Trump's withdrawal is hardly bold news Trump's other plans make it clear he's out to help corporations, not the average worker, he says Donald Trump is likely to portray withdrawing from the Trans Pacific Partnership as a bold stroke, and his not-constrained-by-facts White House is sure to tout it as the greatest economic move made by an occupant of the Oval Office in modern history. But, looking more closely, the decision reflects mostly a political reality, combined with a healthy helping of cynical economic misdirection. The truth is that Donald Trump had very little to do with the TPP\u2019s demise. The TPP was dead in the water in America because of a long-term, unrelenting political campaign here and abroad, led by unions, environmentalists, and consumer groups. Opponents effectively unmasked the TPP as another failed so-called \u201cfree trade\u201d deal \u2014 a tidy arrangement that had little to do with unfettered trade, and far more to do with handing more power to large corporate interests to exploit labor and protect capital, especially patents and intellectual property.   Once the argument for TPP\u2019s alleged economic benefits for regular people crumbled, Barack Obama tried to play the China card: he said that the TPP, which covered 12 Pacific Rim nations, was needed to counter China\u2019s influence in the region. But, as Public Citizen correctly pointed out, that justification had been used over many years to ram through various trade deals, and it was without merit. The political pressure against the TPP built up enough opposition among an overwhelming number of Congressional Democrats and enough Republicans to make it unpassable. For that reason, the lame-duck session after the election saw no action taken on the TPP. Biden is right -- Trump has some growing up to do We need to understand today\u2019s announcement as entirely empty political entertainment, which is classic Trump. As I pointed out last spring, Trump has a finely-tuned huckster\u2019s ear. He understood that railing against so-called \u201cfree trade,\u201d particularly the horrendous Bill Clinton-era North American Free Trade Agreement, would reap political benefits, particularly in a number of states where those bad deals laid waste to good-paying, unionized industrial jobs. But Donald Trump has never cared about the average worker. In fact, Trump biographer Michael D\u2019Antonio, who has spent many hours with his subject, told me in a recent podcast, that Trump is quite content to do the worst to the little guy \u2014 witness the thousands of lawsuits filed against Trump for ripping off average people who worked for him. In the current political environment, Trump wants his grandiose signature withdrawing from the dead-as-a-doornail TPP to distract people from extinction-level, imminent threats facing working Americans from this Administration. Just his repeal of the Affordable Care Act would do far more immediate damage to people than the TPP: it would leave millions of people without health care, and bankrupt families socked with immoral health care bills. His income cut tax plans would shovel $2.1 trillion into the pockets of the wealthiest Americans, leaving society less able to pay for basic needs.  He has already promised corporations an almost free pass to repatriate hundreds of billions of dollars that will, if past practice is a guide, create very few jobs but end up ballooning CEO paychecks and benefits.  His designated minions waiting to get the keys to the departments of Labor, Education, and Health and Human Services (HHS) are hell-bent on applying a blowtorch to minimum wage laws, workplace safety, school funding and a whole raft of human services, not to mention killing unions, who built the middle-class. All of these policies will likely keep at bay, for now, the corporate lobbyists, the Chamber of Commerce and Republicans, who viewed rock-solid support for so-called \u201cfree trade\u201d as a fundamental principle of the Republican Party. Their sorrow at the setback in the march to impose corporate trade deals will be assuaged by the glitter of the vast riches about to shower on the elites as Donald Trump, slowly but surely, dismantles any semblance of fairness in America.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Issac Bailey has been a journalist in South Carolina for two decades and was most recently the primary columnist for The Sun News in Myrtle Beach. He was a 2014 Harvard University Nieman fellow. Follow him on Twitter: @ijbailey. The views expressed are his own. The story of a woman who died of cancer shows health care shouldn't involve politics, writes Issac Bailey Repealing Obamacare without a replacement is an injustice, he writes The closer we inch towards the dismantling of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, otherwise known as Obamacare, the more I remember a young woman I met around the time that health reform legislation was becoming law. Her name was Devin Pate. It\u2019s why I\u2019ve long supported the law even more than I support the man it is named after. Devin had two parents who loved her, each of whom worked long hours to pay the usual monthly bills. They fell squarely in the much-discussed white working class that received so much attention during this past election cycle. Devin worked, too. And she was on scholarship at the College of Charleston in South Carolina until a tumor the size of a Butterball turkey grew inside her \u2013 and returned, along with other tumors, after it was removed and cancerous cells (and some healthy ones) were killed off by the chemicals pumped into her veins to try to make her well. House approves step to repeal Obamacare She suffered from a rare cancer called Gardner syndrome.  And no matter how many times she had an upset stomach or saw her hair fall out or how weak she grew, she felt obligated to keep her part-time job even after she was forced to leave school, which meant no more scholarship \u2013 which triggered a quirk in her parents\u2019 health care coverage that exposed her family to an ungodly sum of medical bills they couldn\u2019t possibly pay. And for too long during the final months of her life, she had to worry about becoming a financial burden on her mother, not wanting to be the reason they couldn\u2019t make ends meet, even though she needed every ounce of the energy she could muster to try to get better. When the disease was finally too much for her 21-year-old body, and life left her on Thanksgiving weekend two years after we met, her loved ones saying their final goodbyes in a hospital room, Obamacare\u2019s initial provisions had only just begun to take hold. So this isn\u2019t a tale about how Obamacare saved Devin, because it didn\u2019t, and couldn\u2019t, even though it surely has saved tens of thousands of Americans. Obama's final report card: Did he live up to his promise? House Speaker Paul Ryan didn\u2019t know Devin. But he did come face-to-face Thursday with a man whose life was saved by Obamacare. If Ryan is serious about making things better, not worse, if his goal is an improved health care system, not just naked partisan political point-scoring, he wouldn\u2019t dare repeal that law without a documented replacement that would pass at the same time. To do otherwise would be to literally toy with the lives of thousands of Americans, like the man he faced during that CNN town hall. The politics are treacherous for health reform in the best of times, with a popular president. These are not those times. Neither is this about Obama and his legacy or how Obamacare fits into that narrative. I\u2019m frustrated that the Republican Party, which has been claiming for years it would \u201crepeal and replace\u201d the health reform law with something better, seems eager to repeal even though it could pull the rug from under at least 20 million Americans who have health insurance because of it, and tens of millions more who have benefitted in ways they don\u2019t even realize. But this is not about that, either. GOP's disastrous plan for Obamacare, Planned Parenthood It\u2019s confounding to see the reports of people who rely upon the health care law who voted for Donald Trump and Republicans anyway, either believing the GOP and the new president wouldn\u2019t dare pull the rug from under them or that their particular Obamacare plans weren\u2019t really Obamacare. That\u2019s an interesting piece of data in the debate over health reform but is not the most important thing. And it is disconcerting that so few people seem to realize that the law, while it got no Republican votes, was built upon a Republican platform from the mid-1990s that was negotiated over the course of several months by a bipartisan six-person committee in the Senate, not a radical liberal takeover of our health care, as it has been falsely described too frequently.  But my memory of Devin is more important than all of that. I can\u2019t forget her because, for the life of me, I don\u2019t get why it is OK for a family like hers \u2013 in the richest country the world has ever known \u2013 to have to suffer unnecessarily, to have to stress about how best to balance keeping a roof over their heads while praying good health would return to their daughter. There are a thousand different ways to illustrate injustice. I know that Devin suffered one during the final years of her life for no good reason, and that it happens to too many Americans, and that as long as health reform remains a political football, that injustice will repeat itself the way cancer cells kept multiplying inside Devin until her body could take no more.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Paul Sracic is professor and chairman of the Department of Politics and International Relations at Youngstown State University and a former Fulbright scholar in Japan. The views expressed are his own. Paul Sracic: Trump's threats to Ford, Carrier appear to have lead to tangible results: jobs retained in US He has won the trust of a significant amount of voters and that will carry over into trust for his trade ideas, he writes Ford Motor announced Tuesday that it would not invest in new manufacturing operations in Mexico, and instead would create 700 new jobs in Michigan. This follows on the heels of a similar announcement by the United Technologies unit, Carrier, in November that it would save hundreds of jobs at an Indiana plant, and not move them to Mexico. These moves did not take place in a vacuum. In each case, the companies faced an implicit, and sometimes explicit, threat from President-elect Donald Trump. And it will be fascinating to watch what GM ultimately does in response to Trump\u2019s tweet Tuesday slamming the company\u2019s practice of selling some Chevy Cruze hatchbacks in the US that have been produced in Mexico, especially since GM recently announced plans to lay off potentially 1,200 workers from its Lordstown, Ohio, production line, where the sedan version of the Cruze is manufactured. General Motors is sending Mexican made model of Chevy Cruze to U.S. car dealers-tax free across border. Make in U.S.A.or pay big border tax! Many will point out that in these cases, we are talking about at most a few thousand jobs. Still, it is stunning to consider that all of this has happened in the weeks before Trump assumes the presidency and that it has happened as a result of threats, not actions. And that may be an important harbinger about how the Trump administration will deal with economic and, in particular, trade issues after January 20. Trump won, after all, in large part on a promise to reopen boarded up factories, keep jobs in the United States and \u201crip up\u201d unfair trade deals. So does this mean the US under President Trump will embrace protectionism in way not seen in almost a century? I don\u2019t think so. In fact, one can argue that the election of Trump might just have saved the free-trade movement. Just as most analysts during the campaign failed to understand the strength of Trump\u2019s appeal to disgruntled Rust Belt voters in the upper Midwest, economic analysts are still missing the substance of his message on jobs and trade. Salena Zito, the one reporter who seemed to grasp Trump\u2019s appeal from the start, famously noted that Trump\u2019s supporters \u201ctake him seriously, but not literally,\u201d while the press, and his detractors, do just the opposite. Trump mulls tariffs, stands by campaign pledge The distinction may also be true when it comes to Trump\u2019s trade policy.  It\u2019s best not to take his protectionist campaign rhetoric too literally.  Just as it is unlikely that Trump would have actually placed a 35% tariff on Ford cars being shipped from Mexico \u2014 because he, or his advisers, understand the dire consequences of setting off a trade war \u2013 the protectionist rhetoric is more of a threat than a plan of action. Trump has basically said as much. For example, in his 2000 book (written with Dave Shiflett), \u201cThe America that We Deserve,\u201d Trump explained that, \u201cWe need tougher negotiations, not protectionist walls around America.\u201d More recently, two senior advisers to the Trump campaign, Peter Navarro, a UC Irvine Economist, and Wilbur Ross, a billionaire investor who is Trump\u2019s pick to head the Commerce Department, wrote that in a Trump administration, \u201ctariffs will be used not as an end game, but rather as a negotiation tool to encourage our trade partners to cease cheating.\u201d So rather than expecting a President Trump to unilaterally use the powers granted to him under, say, sections 122 and 301 of the Trade Act of 1974, to place tariffs of 15% or more on goods coming into the US, we ought to anticipate that these powers will serve as threats \u2013 though necessarily not empty ones \u2013 intended to soften up the negotiating positions of our partners. Ryan won't commit to passing Trump tariff plan But here is what is most important: If the strategy works, the prospects for new trade agreements, especially bilateral agreements, which Trump seems to favor, are very good. This is particularly true in a relative sense. The fact is, support for expanding US free-trade agreements was not good even before the November results.  After all, the granting of Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) to President Obama in June 2015 was highly controversial, and just barely passed in the House of Representatives. The notion that the Trans-Pacific Partnership was ever going to be approved by Congress, though mistakenly promoted to our allies by the Obama administration, was always in doubt among those who were paying attention to the vote count. Trump\u2019s victory, in fact, was the symptom of a larger anti-globalist disease that was going to infect the politics surrounding any free-trade agreements, regardless of whom the partners were or whom the president was. But because Trump has been so outspoken on trade deals, he has the bona fides, especially with working-class voters in the upper Midwest, to potentially change the political landscape on the issue. President-elect Trump slams China on Twitter Trump likes to portray himself as the master negotiator \u2013 the expert in \u201cThe Art of the Deal.\u201d If a significant number of voters buy his branding of himself, they may also trust him when he reassures them some day by saying something like \u201cthis deal, unlike others negotiated by the US in the past, is a victory for American workers.\u201d The analogy that comes to mind is President Nixon\u2019s ability to go to communist China to meet with Mao Zedong. Just as no one could claim that Nixon was soft on communism, no one can seriously charge Trump, so far, with being soft on trade. The result will be that, while the TPP and its European counterpart, the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP), may be dead to the US, the prospects for bilateral agreements between, for example, Japan and the US, and the UK and the US, are actually brighter than they were on November 7. Douglas Holtz-Eakin: Trump's bad  tariff idea (and better one on tax reform) And that is where the tweeting Trump will have a distinct advantage over his predecessors in the Oval Office.  Indeed, this bargaining advantage with the American people will likely be enhanced by the manufacturing jobs Trump can already claim credit for saving at Carrier and Ford. Of course, this assumes a level of skill on the part of the incoming administration. Tariffs may well be used as a bargaining chip, and damaging trade wars can emerge accidentally, even when the effects are counter to the interests of all the belligerents. Still, for those who are mourning the demise of the free-trade era, there is a glimmer of real hope.",

            "article_content": "At Pullen Memorial Baptist Church, the pews are packed with people who mostly do not share a history with the man they\u2019ve come to hear. They rise when he enters the sanctuary at five minutes past 7 in the evening, and before he utters a single word, they give him a standing ovation. Last year, two defiant minutes on the stage of the Democratic National Convention turned Khizr Khan into an unwitting celebrity, but he has held onto his humility. He stands now before this North Carolina audience, slightly hunched in a dark navy suit and striped tie. He bows his head, brings his hands together in a perfect Namaste. The church lights illuminate a small pin on his lapel that says everything: Gold Star father. His middle son, Humayun Khan, served in Iraq as a captain in the US Army and was killed in 2004 by a suicide bomber in Baquba. He is perhaps the best known of the Muslim American soldiers who have died in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. Muslim American Gold Star father on son's sacrifice It was the Khan family\u2019s sacrifice that cast a national spotlight on them. But it was Donald Trump\u2019s attacks on Muslims and immigrants that inspired Khan to speak out. One year after Trump\u2019s election, Khan remains steadfast as a brown immigrant man grateful for everything America has given him \u2013 and indignant as ever at the man who occupies the White House. I meet Khan for the first time here in Raleigh, a stop on a promotional tour for his new book, a memoir of a Pakistani farmer\u2019s son who read Rumi by moonlight and eventually made it in America as a Harvard-trained lawyer. Khan was born 12 years before me, but both of us grew up in similar cultural environments \u2013 though my family in India never suffered the recriminations of life under dictatorship as he did in Pakistan. Especially sweet, I thought, were Khan\u2019s recollections in his book of meeting the beautiful woman in the yellow sari who would later become his wife. I know firsthand the limitations on courtship and dating in a conservative society. For all the obvious reasons, Khan\u2019s book resonates with immigrants like me. He writes of his love of the values and ideals cherished in America and his devotion to the US Constitution, a document now associated with Khan after his convention appearance. He first read it in a college class in Pakistan and was awed by the rights and freedoms afforded to every American: equal protection of law and dignity. He was taken with a nation that gave its citizenry such birth rights, all the more so because he lived through martial law. \u201cI am an American patriot not because I was born here,\u201d Khan writes, \u201cbut because I was not.\u201d Khan\u2019s deeply personal story gives heft to his examination of how we, in this age of acrimony and deep divisions, see ourselves as individuals \u2013 and as a nation. Everyone who has come to hear him tonight, I am certain, will carry Khan\u2019s words with them, especially with another Veterans Day upon us. Earlier, I\u2019d sat with Khan in a downtown hotel lobby and talked about his son. I thought of all the Gold Star mothers, fathers and wives I had met while covering the Iraq War. I\u2019d heard men like Robert Stokely, whose son Michael was killed in 2005, speak of the sacrifices of military families. But Khan was the first man from my part of the world I\u2019d heard speak in this vein. I asked him what message he has for America on Veterans Day. \u201cWe live in one of the best countries on planet Earth,\u201d Khan told me. \u201cEvery value of this country is worth defending, and we pay tribute on Veterans Day to those who have given and sacrificed their all in defense of this country. We are free today because of them. We are prosperous because of their sacrifices. We are custodians of their fairness and goodness. We remain a beacon of hope for the rest of the world because of their sacrifices. \u201cHad they not sacrificed their time, their life, their blood, and all abilities, we would not be here today.\u201d I had often wondered if Khan had been worn down by the ugliness over the last year, not just toward Muslims and immigrants but toward him, specifically. I wondered if he thought now his son\u2019s sacrifice might have been in vain. Far from it. He had faith that the basic principles on which this country was founded would prevail in the end. It warmed my heart to learn Khan\u2019s hope had not frayed. Veterans Day 2017: What you need to know I watch Khan intently as he winds down this speaking engagement, his 165th since he famously took on Trump. He tells his audience about some of the experiences recounted so eloquently in \u201cAn American Family: A Memoir of Hope and Sacrifice.\u201d If you read the book, you\u2019ll learn how he wrestled with his decision to appear at the convention. His family and friends warned him not to politicize his son\u2019s death, and he had decided to turn down the invitation to speak. But then he found a single envelope in his mailbox. There was no stamp, no return address. The handwriting belonged to a child. \u201cDear Mr. Khan,\u201d the letter said. \u201cYou are a lawyer. Can you please not let them deport Maria? She is in fifth grade and she is our friend. Thank you.\u201d Khan walked back to his house, to a room set up to pay tribute to Humayun\u2019s life. He stared at his son\u2019s photograph, at his deep, dark eyes, and asked himself: \u201cWhat would Humayun do?\u201d If you read Khan\u2019s book, you will learn how he grieves for his son. How he and his wife, Ghazala, learned to go on with their lives, to \u201cmake peace with a specter we knew would never leave.\u201d At the convention last year, Khan pulled out a pocket-size copy of the Constitution and addressed Trump: \u201cHave you ever read the United States Constitution?\u201d \u201cHave you ever been to Arlington Cemetery? Go look at the graves of brave patriots who died defending the United States of America. You will see all faiths, genders and ethnicities. You have sacrificed nothing \u2013 and no one.\u201d Trump dismissed Khan, suggesting he, too, had made many sacrifices. Trump even implied Ghazala Khan\u2019s silence on stage was because of female subservience expected in certain strains of conservative Islam. And a feud ensued in the media. More recently, that feud has continued with Khan\u2019s public criticism of the way Trump handled a phone call to the widow of one of four servicemen killed in Niger. The family, says Khan, was not afforded the dignity and privacy they deserved. He lashes out, too, at Gen. John Kelly, Trump\u2019s chief of staff whose own son was killed in Afghanistan, for defending the president\u2019s handling of the situation. \u201cHe knows how sensitive these moments are,\u201d Khan says. \u201cNo protocol was followed. The president is incompetent to speak to these families.\u201d I can see the rage, no, disappointment, in Khan\u2019s eyes that the nation\u2019s commander in chief would speak to a Gold Star family this way. He could imagine how it must have compounded the family\u2019s shock, and the intense grief that followed. A soldier\u2019s death cannot be politicized this way, Khan says. He wonders what the White House actions say about the moral compass of this nation. Veterans: I knew I wanted to serve After Khan\u2019s comments this evening, a few people line up at a microphone to ask him questions. The first comes from a man who begins: \u201cThank you for being here and where do I go to sign up for your Senate campaign?\u201d The second is more serious. Shanna Ratashak has thought long and hard about what to ask Khan. The wife of a retired Army lieutenant colonel, Ratashak served on many an Army CARE team, responsible for helping military families deal with deaths and other crises. She has been to Army homes to console mothers, fathers, spouses. She could never truly know how the Khans felt in losing their son, but she felt she might be able to understand better than most. She also knows this: that the biggest sacrifices military families make do not just take place on the battlefield. They happen quietly and without recognition, often at home: weddings canceled, celebrations postponed, children raised with one parent on long deployments. Only those left behind bear witness to these acts. She feels America has forgotten its service members. So few are in the military these days. It wasn\u2019t like World War II or Vietnam, where everyone seemed to know someone in uniform. She feels people are generous with platitudes \u2013 \u201cthank you for your service\u201d \u2013 but don\u2019t understand what that service means. When she saw Khan speak at the convention, she sat up and paid attention to the television. Finally, she thought, someone was speaking on her behalf. \u201cWhen he had the courage to get up and say, \u2018My son sacrificed for everyone,\u2019 it was so moving. It was giving all these families a voice,\u201d she tells me. And when she learned Khan was speaking in Raleigh, she obtained a ticket, hoping she would be able to get away on a school night. She settled her kids and, before leaving home Tuesday evening, sat down to pen a letter. \u201cDear Mr. Khan,\u201d Ratashak began writing on lined notebook paper. \u201cI was so touched by your story \u2026 by your courage. What an American story yours is, and it is the exact thing that makes our country great. It has always been great and does not need to be made great again. Your son\u2019s story reminds me so much of my husband\u2019s. \u201cThank you for standing up to the hate of DJT, who should never be allowed to be commander in chief. It\u2019s a travesty to our service. May you know you touched the lives of many, and your son\u2019s service and sacrifice will always be remembered. \u201cI wish you beautiful memories of your son forever \u2026 until you meet again.\u201d Ratashak planned to give Khan the letter at a book signing after his talk. She didn\u2019t know if she would get that opportunity, so she stood in line to tell him instead. She says she can\u2019t imagine losing a child at war and then have people at home not understand her sacrifice. She tells him she senses bitterness among veterans and their families that they are somehow not appreciated. She asks Khan for advice on what she ought to say to them. Khizr Khan's powerful DNC speech (Full speech) There are many in the audience eager to hear Khan\u2019s answer. Among them is the organizer of the event, Rene Martin, whose son completed three tours of Iraq. Each time, she lived in fear that she, too, would become a Gold Star parent. Khan begins his answer to Ratashak by thanking her. \u201cFirst I humbly pay tribute to your family\u2019s service,\u201d he says. \u201cI am testament to the respect and dignity that this nation bestows on its men and women serving in the military and law enforcement. They are our heroes. Their families are our heroes. We cherish them. We respect them. They are our protectors.\u201d He says his son wrote an essay once while he was still a young cadet. It was titled \u201cDemocracy requires vigilance and sacrifice.\u201d \u201cHow true it is today,\u201d Khan says. \u201cOur democracy, our democratic system of life requires vigilance because those who do not wish us well have attacked us and sown this division among us by exploiting some issues. This nation never forgets the sacrifice of its men and women in uniform. We are in debt.\u201d He then tells the audience what I already know. That on Veterans Day, he will again visit Humayun\u2019s grave at Arlington Cemetery. In his book, he describes his son\u2019s headstone as \u201ca slab of white marble with soft streaks the color of wood smoke\u201d that has \u201ca star nestled in a crescent moon\u201d etched above his name, date of birth and date of death, the medals he received and the conflict in which he was killed: Operation Iraqi Freedom.

            "article_content": "Mother Nature, you need to calm down. There\u2019s all kinds of new extreme weather news, plus everything else\u00a0you need to know to Get Up to Speed and Out the Door. (You can also get \u201c5 Things You Need to Know Today\u201d delivered to your inbox daily. Sign up here.) It\u2019s finally here.\u00a0House Republicans revealed their new tax bill Thursday, and though President Donald Trump has voiced his approval, he admits there is \u201cmuch work left to do.\u201d Major provisions of the bill include decreasing\u00a0the number of tax brackets from seven to four, reducing the\u00a0top corporate income tax rate\u00a0and increasing\u00a0the standard deduction, which could affect some popular tax breaks for individuals such as\u00a0mortgage interest, state and local taxation, charitable giving and student loan interest. Republican leaders acknowledge the fight ahead\u00a0but insist that, overall, this is a plan that will give a generational lift to the middle class\u00a0\u2013 despite Democratic assertions it is just another disguised giveaway to the GOP\u2019s rich friends. Today the House is supposed to vote on the budget blueprint that\u2019s already been OK\u2019d by the Senate, the next step in the GOP and Trump administration effort to overhaul the tax code. But there\u2019s trouble on the horizon. There are a lot of House Republicans upset over the budget framework\u2019s plan to wipe out the deduction for state and local taxes. That tax break is extremely popular in\u00a0high-tax states like California, New York and Illinois. The Republicans can only afford to lose about 22 votes on this, but there are about 30 GOP members from districts that rely heavily on this deduction \u2013 enough to sink the budget. So Republican leaders are scrambling to come up with a compromise. Warren said so Thursday after being asked by CNN\u2019s Jake Tapper whether she believes that the Democratic campaign organization was tipped in favor of Clinton over her primary opponent, Sen. Bernie Sanders Her comments came in response to an excerpt from a new book by Donna Brazile, former interim chair of the Democratic National Committee, detailing the final months of the 2016 campaign. In the excerpt published in Politico this week, Brazile says Clinton\u2019s team was given operational control over the party committee before Clinton was the nominee because of the massive amounts of funds it raised for the DNC. Brazile\u2019s story points to a longstanding rift among Democrats that casts concern over how the party will handle its opportunities in the 2020 election. Veteran journalist Mark Halperin sexually harassed women while he was in a powerful position at ABC News, according to five women who shared their previously undisclosed accounts with CNN and others who did not experience the alleged harassment personally, but were aware of it. Spacey issued an apology in response to Rapp\u2019s account.\u00a0When asked about the new allegations, Netflix said in a statement to CNN that it sent a representative to the \u201cHouse of Cards\u201d set Monday. Spacey did not respond to CNN\u2019s request for comment about the latest accusations. Meanwhile, director and producer Brett Ratner has filed suit against a woman he says defamed him by alleging he raped her. Six women have come forward saying Ratner harassed or assaulted them, but the woman in question is an additional accuser who accused Ratner of rape in a Facebook post.\u00a0Ratner denied the other accusations earlier through his attorney. All of these allegations come in the wake of last month\u2019s New York Times story detailing numerous accusations of sexual misconduct against movie producer Harvey Weinstein. More than 40 women have accused Weinstein of inappropriate behavior, ranging from sexual harassment to rape. Weinstein has \u201cunequivocally denied\u201d all allegations of rape. Page\u2019s testimony will likely fuel further scrutiny about what Sessions knew about connections between the Trump campaign and Russia \u2013 and communications about Russia that he did not disclose despite a persistent line of questioning in three hearings this year. After a tumultuous week in Washington, Trump will embark today on a critical 12-day diplomatic trip to Asia. There he will meet with the leaders of China, South Korea and Japan before traveling south to\u00a0attend the Asia-Pacific Economic Cooperation summit in\u00a0Da Nang, Vietnam, and then visiting\u00a0the Philippine\u00a0capital of Manila for meetings with the Association of Southeast Asian Nations. North Korea and the state of the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade agreement will be hot topics on the trip.

            "article_content": "For unsuspecting residents of a suburban Montclair, New Jersey, neighborhood, it seemed too crazy to be believed: their quiet, unassuming neighbors had turned out to be Russian spies. The couple, known as Richard and Cynthia Murphy, had appeared to be part of a typical American family, living in a beige, two-story colonial-style home with their two young daughters at 31 Marquette Road. Cynthia\u2019s business card said she worked as a financial planner at an accounting company in nearby Manhattan. Richard told neighbors he was a stay-at-home dad raising Lisa, age nine, and her 11-year-old sister, Kate. The shocking truth emerged when the FBI raided the house in 2010: Richard and Cynthia\u2019s real names were Vladimir and Lydia Guryev. \u201cYou could have told me they were Martians from space and I would have been less surprised,\u201d said Elizabeth Lapin, a poetry professor who still lives down the street from the home now known as \u201cthe spy house.\u201d The Guryevs had been gathering information since the 1990s for Russia\u2019s SVR, which the FBI describes as the modern equivalent of the KGB. The KGB, if you remember, was the widely feared national security agency of the now-defunct Soviet Union, tasked during the Cold War with running a domestic secret police force and operating a network of spies throughout the world. On June 27, 2010, the FBI arrested the Guryevs along with eight other alleged Russian spies in Manhattan, Yonkers, Boston and northern Virginia. The announcement triggered headlines reminiscent of the Cold War, and even inspired the creation of FX\u2019s 1980s-era spy drama \u201cThe Americans.\u201d But while the deep-cover Russian spies on \u201cThe Americans\u201d \u201cdo all sorts of reckless, wild things,\u201d said neighbor Virginia Bailey, that wasn\u2019t the impression she got from the Guryevs. \u201cBy all accounts,\u201d Bailey told CNN, \u201cthese neighbors were neither reckless nor wild.\u201d This is what it was really like to live next door to a Russian spy, according to various Montclair residents who spoke to CNN. Looking back, neighbors say the Guryevs\u2019 \u201cspy house\u201d was a perfect place to hide in plain sight. Manhattan was just 30 minutes away by shuttle bus. And the house property backed up against a 21-acre wildlife preserve where meetings with agents and exchanges of information could easily be hidden from prying eyes. The family wasn\u2019t overly social \u2013 but they weren\u2019t exactly hiding either. Neighbors say they sometimes attended summer neighborhood block parties. Before the raid, Bailey and her daughter, Jessie Gugig, remember seeing their neighbor \u201cCynthia\u201d walking her dog many mornings down Marquette Road. Although they never stopped to have a conversation, Bailey remembered her as being \u201cvery attractive and very well put together. She always dressed very nicely.\u201d Some neighbors said the couple spoke with accents, but Lapin said she never heard one. \u201cThe girls built a lemonade stand one summer,\u201d Lapin said. \u201cThat was such an American thing.\u201d Lapin said she had a \u201cpremonition\u201d that \u201csomething strange\u201d was going on long before the raid. A few months before, she noticed unusual, prolonged construction under the neighborhood streets. The Friday before the raid, she said a police car had been parked in front of her house. But espionage? It never occurred to her, Lapin said. The FBI and CIA first learned about the collection of deep-cover SVR spies in the United States in the early 2000s. They were living as so-called \u201cillegals,\u201d meaning they had no diplomatic protection. Deep-cover Russian spies explained US authorities secretly surveilled all the spies for years, bugging the Guryevs\u2019 house and even secretly searching it when they weren\u2019t around. The FBI told CNN\u2019s original series \u201cDeclassifed\u201d that the Guryevs tried so hard to blend into American society that they didn\u2019t even speak Russian inside their own home. Eventually, the United States cracked a secret code the spies used to communicate with Moscow, allowing the FBI to learn more about the Guryevs\u2019 comings and goings. In 2009, the FBI shot video of a meeting between Vladimir and a Russian government official. Authorities decided it was time to arrest the spy ring. Russian deep-cover spy caught on camera Jessie Gugig remembers being a 15-year-old experiencing the shock of watching FBI vans stop at the Guryevs\u2019 home, just a stone\u2019s throw from her own residence. \u201cEventually another car pulled up and guys in suits with earpieces showed up with some papers that must have been a warrant,\u201d Gugig, now a 22-year-old law student, recalled. Agents suddenly poured into the home, turning on the lights and searching it from top to bottom. \u201cThe house got lit up like it was Christmas,\u201d she said. For at least a week after the raid, the press seemed to be everywhere throughout the neighborhood, said Gugig\u2019s mother Bailey. \u201cI mean hordes of them,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was just a carnival.\u201d Lapin gathered up enough courage to approach the house after the arrest and peer into the window. Inside she saw several items on a table \u2014 including Lisa\u2019s textbook on Chinese grammar, stacks of coins and a copy of a 1953 post-World War-II memoir, \u201cWoman in Berlin.\u201d On the wall next to a piano was a \u201cbeautiful painting\u201d of a young girl, which Lapin believes was a self-portrait by Kate. The Guryevs\u2019 two girls, Bailey said, were taken away to stay with a family friend. Two weeks after the FBI arrests, Moscow and Washington made a deal. After all ten of those arrested pleaded guilty to being Russian agents, the United States agreed to transfer them to Russian custody. In exchange, Moscow agreed to release \u201cfour individuals\u201d who were \u201cincarcerated in Russia for alleged contact with Western intelligence agencies,\u201d the Justice Department said. Kate and Lisa \u2013 who were born in the United States \u2013 eventually accompanied their parents back to Russia. US Attorney General Eric Holder told CBS\u2019 \u201cFace the Nation\u201d in 2010 that the Guryevs\u2019 kids and all other children of the Russian agents were \u201crepatriated.\u201d \u201cThat whole aspect was very sad,\u201d said Bailey. \u201cTo all of a sudden have their lives completely and utterly changed. The children didn\u2019t know Russia \u2026 They have to leave their friends abruptly and suddenly. \u2026 Everything would have just been so radically different.\u201d Former FBI operative Eric O\u2019Neill, who helped catch FBI double agent Robert Hanssen, said in 2010 that it\u2019s unusual for spies serving overseas to have children, because they could suffer from divided loyalties. \u201cWhen you\u2019re a parent, you\u2019re supposed to take care of your kids. You are supposed to put them first in your life. And a spy can\u2019t do that,\u201d O\u2019Neill said. At the time, having Russian spies in the neighborhood felt like a weird throwback to the Cold War, neighbors said. But now that people on Marquette Road are hearing more about heightened tensions between Russia and the United States, they say the idea of Russian spies living among Americans doesn\u2019t seem so surprising. Some of them are following the current US government investigations into Russia\u2019s meddling in the 2016 election and potential collusion with members of Donald Trump\u2019s presidential campaign. US investigations about Russia: Everything you need to know In fact, Russian spies are ramping up their intelligence-gathering efforts inside the United States, current and former US intelligence officials told CNN this month. Former Soviet KGB spymaster Oleg Kalugin told CNN he \u201cwould not be surprised\u201d to learn that Russia is still running illegal deep-cover spies in the United States. But he suspects these programs would be less active now than in 2010. Kalugin, who says he never ran illegal deep-cover programs, criticized them as wasteful and inefficient. \u201cIt\u2019s risky and lonely and a really difficult job,\u201d he said. One of the key pieces of evidence uncovered by the FBI in the 2010 case was a message Russian spymasters sent the Guryevs shortly before their arrest. \u201cYou were sent to USA for long-term service trip,\u201d the message said. \u201cYour education, bank accounts, car, house etc. \u2013 all these serve one goal: fulfill your main mission, i.e. to search and develop ties in policymaking circles and send intels to C.\u201d \u201cC\u201d is thought to refer to \u201cThe Center,\u201d an espionage information clearinghouse in Russia. Built in 1950, the beige, two-story house is a typical middle class home for the area. It measures a bit more than 1,800 square feet and the county valued it this year at $425,700, according to Essex County tax records. So much time has passed that \u201cit\u2019s hard to believe it happened,\u201d said Bailey. \u201cNature is kind of taking the house back,\u201d Gugig said. \u201cIvy is starting to eat into the house. The garden is completely overgrown.\u201d \u201cThe house just sits there and it\u2019s empty,\u201d she added. \u201cIt\u2019s just a constant reminder.\u201d Lapin \u2013 who has lived near the house for 11 years \u2013 said the neighborhood was friendlier before the raid. \u201cI liked the neighborhood \u2013 until this event happened,\u201d she said. But the old vibe has slowly been coming back, she said. Several of her neighbors have left since the raid \u2013 replaced by new residents who don\u2019t associate the house with the spies. A local realtor said the home has recently been sold. Perhaps a new family will move in soon, which will help Montclair close the book and move on from its connection to international espionage.",

            "article_content": "Tears rolled down her face as Ursula Phoenix stood in Grant Park witnessing Barack Obama, a man from the South Side of Chicago, become the first black President of the United States in 2008. She thought about her grandfather, who was once stopped from voting at gunpoint. And her mother, who left Alabama for Chicago, looking for a slice of equality. She thought about her 6-year-old daughter growing up in the era of the first African-American president. \u201cTonight because of what we did on this day, in this election, at this defining moment change has come to America,\u201d she heard Obama declare during his victory speech. But things didn\u2019t get better for perhaps the people who needed it most. That\u2019s because Obama\u2019s national message of hope had an unfortunate exception: his hometown. In Phoenix\u2019s mind, if a politician could deliver on a promise, it was Obama. And there was one vow in particular she remembers from a campaign speech in early 2008. \u201cOur prosperity can and must be the tide that lifts every boat, that we rise or fall as one nation, that our economy is strongest when our middle-class grows and opportunity is spread as widely as possible,\u201d Obama proclaimed. More than eight years later, Obama returns to Chicago on Tuesday night to deliver a farewell. Like many here, Phoenix has pride for the walls Obama knocked down, but she struggles with the feeling that he could have done more. \u201cThere was no consideration for those whose boat was cemented to the bottom, who were drowning,\u201d Phoenix says. When President Obama spoke of hope and change in 2008, Ja\u2019Mal Green, a community organizer, believed it would translate to safety on his block. But that\u2019s not the reality he sees as he walks the South Side streets today. He points to last year\u2019s spike in violence: 762 were killed in 2016, more than New York and Los Angeles combined. Green says he wishes President Obama would have used his position to bring more attention to the issues impacting black communities, like poverty, the underfunding of schools and the lack of economic investment in rough neighborhoods. \u201cWe are not going to be saying thank you for the eight years of work that he didn\u2019t do in the black communities,\u201d Green says of Obama\u2019s return to Chicago. During Obama\u2019s tenure in the White House, 3,917 people were murdered in Chicago, police records show. \u201cIt\u2019s heartbreaking,\u201d President Obama told CNN affiliate WLS about the violence in Chicago. \u201cObviously, most issues around crime and safety are local. I can\u2019t send the Marines into Chicago \u2026 I said in Grant Park when I was declared the winner of the presidency that this wasn\u2019t a task for one year, or one term, or even one president.\u201d Since he left Chicago for Washington, several high-profile murders and crime statistics have kept the city in a grim spotlight. And a fractured relationship between police and black teens following the police shooting of Laquan McDonald only added fuel to an existing fire. The teen was shot 16 times. Most of the bullets were fired while his body was lying on the ground. Police reports later revealed officers on the scene lied to cover up the shooting. \u201cWe do feel neglected,\u201d Green says. \u201cAnd we felt like [Obama] could do more and he could have possibly saved some lives.\u201d Green says he understands that age-old ills aren\u2019t cured in eight years. But if there was a president who could help, he says, it would be the president who marched the same streets, demanding change. Some of President Obama\u2019s faithful supporters gathered inside a historic Catholic church for Sunday mass ahead of his farewell address this week. Believers like Savannah Dean say their prayers were answered when Obama was elected. And when people are critical of President Obama for not fixing Chicago\u2019s problems, she says they are being unfair. \u201cI don\u2019t blame Obama for it,\u201d Dean tells CNN. \u201cI think people who criticize him don\u2019t know better.\u201d She points to some of his successes: the low national unemployment rate; the more than 16 million people who got health insurance after the Affordable Care Act was passed. Other supporters defend Obama by saying he was the leader of the country, not the mayor of Chicago. There were plenty of economic and international pressing issues he had to deal with as president. He couldn\u2019t drop everything for one city. \u201cObama tried his best. He\u2019s only the president. He\u2019s not a dictator. He can\u2019t do whatever he wants to do,\u201d Chicago resident Melvin Worley says. Phoenix won\u2019t be attending Obama\u2019s farewell speech on Tuesday evening. She will be watching it on television from her home on the South Side. This time, she and her family will look for new seeds of hope for Chicago. His planned presidential library on the South Side, Phoenix says, is an opportunity for kids to trade in guns for jobs. \u201cI think that [Obama] is iconic when it comes to one\u2019s ability to bootstrap to make it,\u201d Phoenix says. \u201cAnd to be able to ascend against all odds.\u201d That\u2019s perhaps where many of the people who are disappointed about Obama in Chicago got it wrong. \u201cObama is not the messiah,\u201d Phoenix says. But she hopes his return to Chicago will help end a dark chapter for the city he loves. \u201cI think his physical presence is welcomed and needed,\u201d Phoenix says. \u201cAnytime he is around, it\u2019s going to be helpful to the youth and to us all.\u201d President Obama gives his farewell address tonight at 9 ET from Chicago. You can watch it live on CNN TV, CNN Go and on your mobile devices. Or follow along with our live blog.",

            "article_content": "Vulnerable Democratic incumbents are betting that the Republican tax bill will be a political albatross in the 2018 midterm elections \u2013 but it could be a risky gamble, strategists from both parties tell CNN. Of 10 Senate Democrats up for re-election next year in states that President Donald Trump won in 2016, not one voted to support the GOP\u2019s legislative achievement. Likewise, not a single House Democrat backed the bill. At-risk Democrats likely felt less political pressure because the legislation has polled poorly and the President\u2019s approval rating remains low. But Democrats from red states will still need to win over a share of Republican voters next year, many of whom view tax reform and the President favorably. \u201cThere\u2019s no doubt Democrats have the wind at their back, but that doesn\u2019t mean that these red state Democrats are going to get a free pass on their votes,\u201d said Neil Newhouse, a Republican pollster and co-founder of Public Opinion Strategies. \u201cThe more these guys act and vote like national Democrats, the more they are putting their campaigns at risk in 2018.\u201d White House, GOP celebrate passing sweeping tax bill Lauren Passalacqua, communications director for the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee, said Democrats \u201cwere eager to work on bipartisan reform\u201d with their Republican counterparts, \u201cbut at the end of the day, Republicans simply weren\u2019t interested, and that\u2019s because this was never about the middle class \u2013 it was about massive tax cuts for corporations and billionaires.\u201d Democrats \u201chave to do what is right for their state,\u201d Passalacqua maintained. \u201cIt was not a political calculus.\u201d Most Senate Democrats laid down a marker on tax reform in August, when 45 of 48 senators signed a letter outlining conditions for their potential support \u2014 including that Republicans forgo reconciliation, a method that enabled them to pass the bill with a simple majority. That was an immediate nonstarter for Republicans, as Democrats knew. But a trio of endangered senators had left the door open for discussions with Republicans: Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota, Joe Donnelly of Indiana and Joe Manchin of West Virginia. The White House set about making its case to these potential swing votes; one senior White House official on Wednesday recalled \u201cmany an evening sitting around a conference table with Joe Manchin, trying to earn his support.\u201d The tax plan brings GOP euphoria at last Leading the discussions were White House legislative affairs director Marc Short, National Economic Council Director Gary Cohn and even the President himself. They remained in discussions with Manchin until the Senate first approved its tax reform plan earlier this month, said Manchin\u2019s spokesman Jonathan Kott. \u201cThey made a good faith effort,\u201d Kott said. But all three Democrats ultimately opposed the bill, a decision that \u201chad a lot more to do with politics than I think it really did about policy,\u201d the White House official said, citing \u201cthe polarizing environment\u201d in American politics. \u201cI think they\u2019re going to have to explain to their voters why they didn\u2019t want to deliver tax relief for their citizens,\u201d the official added. \u201cAnd I\u2019m sorry that they didn\u2019t decide to join with us.\u201d In an interview with Politico this week, Manchin lamented that he could not support the legislation, saying he \u201cwas an easy pickup,\u201d and speculating that \u201ctwo, three other Democrats would have been easy pickups, if they had just made an effort.\u201d Trump lavished with praise at tax celebration By \u201cthey,\u201d Manchin meant Senate Republican leaders, who did not join the White House in engaging with Democratic lawmakers \u2014 in part because Republicans hoped to pass their measure swiftly, but perhaps also as a political calculation. Democrats privately disagree over whether that go-it-alone strategy will prove shrewd or shortsighted for Republicans, particularly in front-line Senate races next year. \u201cMcConnell blew this,\u201d said one senior Democratic source, speaking of Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. The source added: \u201cHe and Trump will regret not having any Democratic support on this.\u201d But a Democratic Senate aide viewed the dynamic differently: \u201cThe best thing for Mitch McConnell is to pass this bill without Democrats, because he can spend next year saying Democrats didn\u2019t give Americans a tax cut,\u201d the aide said. \u201cPolitically, it\u2019s a cutthroat move.\u201d Sanders on tax bill: \"Republicans will rue the day\" For now, Democrats appear to have the political advantage on tax reform. A CNN poll released this week showed opposition to the bill has grown during the past month, with 55 percent of Americans now opposing it. Just 33 percent support the GOP plan, even after an expensive public relations campaign by Republicans and groups aligned with them. Still, McConnell told reporters Wednesday that the task of selling the reforms has only just begun for the GOP. And many Republicans believe public opinion will improve as the new law is implemented, leaving Democrats in a worse spot. \u201cAs the tax plan takes effect, Democrats on the ballot in 2018 will be hard-pressed to explain why they voted against a law that is putting more money in families\u2019 pockets and boosting our economy,\u201d said Katie Martin, National Republican Senatorial Committee communications director. If voters continue to oppose tax reform, Republicans will likely feel the most impact in the House, where the party will be defending 23 seats in districts that Hillary Clinton won. On the Senate side, only one front-line race is expected to feature a Republican incumbent who voted for tax reform: Sen. Dean Heller, in Nevada. But the pendulum could swing in the other direction, to the disadvantage of Democrats \u2014 particularly those from red states. Said Newhouse, \u201cSome of these red state Democrats may a year from now regret their votes.\u201d",

            "article_content": "President Donald Trump is obsessed with the stock market. He has tweeted about it nearly every week since July, giving himself credit for the market\u2019s booming performance this year. \u201cWith the great vote on Cutting Taxes, this could be a big day for the Stock Market - and YOU!\u201d he tweeted Monday morning. Indeed, the Dow Jones Industrial Average was up 57.91 points and closed at 24,289.50 Monday. The DJIA sat just under 20,000 when Trump took office. It has been on a bona fide tear since his win \u2013 it rose 257 points the day after his shock election as chances for tax reform made investors confident. Related from CNN Money: The market\u2019s incredible post-election surge But while Americans and business leaders are glad to give Trump credit for the stock market\u2019s success, they are loath to say he has changed the economy for the good. A recent survey by CNBC of a panel of CFOs found that most believe the stock market is rising because of Trump. But more than half said he deserves no credit for the decline in the unemployment rate, which has dropped from 4.8% to 4.1% since he assumed office. Seventy-eight percent of Americans said in a recent Quinnipiac University poll that Trump\u2019s policies are not making much of a difference or hurting their personal finances even though 72% in that survey said the stock market is doing excellent and a majority said Trump is responsible for its performance. Trump wants more credit for economy. He's getting it. There\u2019s good reason for Americans\u2019 reluctance to closely tie less than a year of stock market gains to the state of the economy or their finances. Past research has found that over a long time horizon, GDP growth and long-term economic health are not correlated with short-term stock market performance. (For the record, the GDP has also been strong during Trump\u2019s year in office.) The prevailing view among mainstream economists about the tax reform bills debated in congress is that they will lead to larger payouts to shareholders, sending stocks up, even if modest or low wage growth follows. There are even bigger problems with giving one President all the credit for a stock market rally in the first year of their term. The economy does not reset itself on inauguration day every four or eight years, waiting for the next president to roll in and start Tweeting self-praise. Instead, a president\u2019s effect on the economy can take years to go into effect, usually lasting after their term is over. \u201cPresidents take way too much credit for the economy in general, and it\u2019s not at all clear that they\u2019re responsible for economic outcomes in their first year,\u201d said Brendan Nyhan, a professor of government at Dartmouth College. The problem of trying to give credit for the economy to a president this early becomes obvious after looking at an exhaustive review of the post-War economy by Princeton University professors Alan Blinder and Mark Watson. Their report found economic performance was better by almost any measure under Democratic presidents. But their findings came with one major, deal-breaking caveat. \u201cDemocrats would no doubt like to attribute the large (Democrat-Republican) growth gap to macroeconomic policy choices, but the data do not support such a claim,\u201d they write. Instead, Democrats can mostly thank \u201cgood luck\u201d with a touch of \u201cgood policy\u201d for their success.Conservative critics took things a step further. They latched onto the study\u2019s small share of praise for Democratic presidents, arguing it didn\u2019t accurately measure the contribution of Republicans and  proposing a new methodology for connecting presidents with the economy. Timothy Kaine, a fellow at the conservative-leaning Hoover Institution, took issue with the way Blinder and Watson used a \u201cone quarter lag\u201d as the point to begin measuring a president\u2019s economy. In other words, only after one quarter of a new presidency passes did Blinder and Watson begin to give credit for the economy to the new president. Kaine did not think that made sense. \u201cWhy does Blinder and Watson lag the presidential term by one quarter, instead of none?\u201d he says. \u201cWhy not two, four, or six?\u201d Kaine proposed an alternative way to give credit to presidents that he calls an \u201coverlapping\u201d approach. It phases credit out from predecessor and in to the new President as more time in office passes. Kaine provides two formulas for how it could work. Using the first, two-thirds of the economy today would be attributable to Obama, making Trump responsible for one-third. Using the second, Obama becomes responsible for 70% of the economy today. Trump is responsible for 30%. So if you are trying to say a President is responsible for the economy today, not only do you have to assume that pure luck is probably the greatest single driver, but more than two-thirds of the economy\u2019s performance should be considered the success of the prior President. This, on top of the fact that the stock market is not the same thing as the economy. That leads us to the question as to why Trump is making such a big deal out of the stock market. Trump styled himself during the election as the \u201cthe middle-class growth candidate.\u201d But his favorite measure of economic success, the stock market, is not very popular with the middle class \u2013 or with Americans in general. According to Gallup, \u201cit appears the financial crisis and recession may have fundamentally changed some Americans\u2019 views of stocks as an investment.\u201d Less than one-third of families in the bottom half of the income percentile own stocks, according to the Federal Reserve. More stocks are owned by foreign investors than by the lower half of the US income spectrum. About 35% of stocks are owned by foreign investors, according to the Tax Policy Center. All told, only about half of families own stocks, part of a downward trend. Eleven percent fewer Americans own stock now than they did before the Great Recession, Gallup found. The exception to this decline is among wealthier Americans and older Americans. Gallup found that Americans with more than $100,000 in household income per year own 1% percent more stock than they did before the recession. They found older Americans also own 1% more stock. Even still, Trump now says he plans to use the gains in the stock market as part of his campaign messaging for 2020. \u201cIt\u2019s called \u2018How is your 401(k) doing?\u2019,\u201d he said at a fundraising event this weekend. That messaging may \u2013 like Trump\u2019s tax plan \u2013 be less popular than he imagines. Recent CNN polling on tax reform suggested Americans were nervous about the tax reform proposals considered by congress. Instead they favor focusing on policies middle-income Americans participate in, like the the Child Tax Credit. They tend to dislike policies that favor the wealthy, like abolishing the estate tax. In general they tend to be worried about declining wages \u2013 not the stock market \u2013 and to list the general health of the economy as a top concern. 401(k)s, the Federal Reserve found, are most commonly used by the top 10% of earners. They are not used as often by the young or minorities. On top of these polling realities, Americans remain lukewarm, if not slightly disdainful, toward the banking sector after the recession. According to Gallup, banking remains less popular than most industry sectors in the economy. The one thing the stock market is for Trump, though, is a win. At least for now, whatever the politics, it\u2019s one bright spot amid an otherwise historically unpopular presidency.",

            "article_content": "Hatch has few votes to spare as he ushers tax bill through the Senate Graham: 'Failure is not an option when it comes to the Republican Party and cutting taxes' Orrin Hatch is facing one of the toughest tasks of his 40-year political career: Ushering a massive tax reform bill through a narrowly divided Senate. Overhauling the tax code is always a tall order, which is one reason Congress hasn\u2019t passed legislation of this magnitude since 1986. But as lawmakers return Monday from the Thanksgiving break, Hatch, the 83-year-old Utah Republican who chairs the tax-writing Senate Finance Committee, faces special challenges. What\u2019s next for the Republican tax plan: All eyes move to the Senate He has few votes to spare with Republicans holding a 52-seat majority in the Senate. Some GOP lawmakers are wavering and Democratic opposition is loud and insistent. There\u2019s no clear strategy for Hatch to win over some lawmakers without alienating others. Meanwhile, polling suggests voters are opposed to the GOP tax plans and Hatch\u2019s negotiating skills could be undercut by persistent rumors that he will soon retire, with Mitt Romney positioned to succeed him. But perhaps the biggest challenge facing Hatch is the existential crisis emerging from Republicans anxious that they haven\u2019t racked up any legislative accomplishments this year despite the party holding complete control of Washington. That\u2019s creating a sense of urgency to pass something \u2013 virtually anything \u2013 that they can show voters going into next year\u2019s midterm elections. \u201cFailure is not an option when it comes to the Republican Party and cutting taxes,\u201d South Carolina GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham told CNN\u2019s Dana Bash Sunday on \u201cState of the Union.\u201d \u201cTo every Republican senator, the fate of the party is in our hands as well as that of the economy.\u201d Sparkling wine, jets, the unborn and other special-interest wins in the tax bill President Donald Trump plans to drum up support for the tax reform bill with a Tuesday visit to Capitol Hill. Senate leaders hope to pass their $1.5 trillion tax package as early as Thursday. The bill would repeal Obamacare\u2019s individual mandate, permanently slash the corporate tax rate and temporarily cut taxes for some individuals. It would have to be reconciled with a House version before Trump could sign it into law. For Hatch, the tax bill is personal as he considers his political future. \u201cIf he decides not to run for re-election, this would be the capstone of the career of a senator who has passed more legislation than any other person in Congress,\u201d said Jason Perry, the director of the University of Utah\u2019s Hinckley Institute of Politics. Though Hatch is widely admired in Utah, three-quarters of Utahans said it was time for someone else to serve as Utah\u2019s senator in a recent poll by the Hinckley Institute. \u201cHe sees this as being the culmination of all of his efforts, a challenge that will utilize all of his skills and relationships in Washington,\u201d Perry said. \u201cHe wants this passed, and you see the passion in it. He\u2019s not going to let anything get in his way.\u201d That passion, as well as the pressure he faces, was evident during an unusual outburst from Hatch just before the Thanksgiving recess as the Finance committee considered the tax bill. The normally genteel chairman, long-commended for seeking out bipartisan alliances with the likes of Ted Kennedy, upbraided Democratic Sen. Sherrod Brown for claiming the tax bill would only benefit the rich. \u201cI really resent anybody saying that I\u2019m just doing this for the rich. Give me a break,\u201d Hatch told the Ohio senator, noting he\u2019d \u201ccome from poor people.\u201d \u201cWe didn\u2019t have anything,\u201d he went on, \u201cso don\u2019t spew that stuff on me. I get a little tired of that crap.\u201d Later on Twitter, Hatch made it clear passing the legislation is personal for him, reminding his followers that he \u201cgrew up in a shack with a Meadow Gold Dairy (billboard) sign for a wall.\u201d Hatch has said that he and his wife lived in a chicken coop during law school, and he has joked over the years that after growing up in a house without indoor plumbing: \u201cI never pass a bathroom by.\u201d \u201cI worked as a janitor to pay for law school,\u201d Hatch tweeted in mid-November after dressing down his Democratic colleagues in committee. \u201cI believe in opportunity because I\u2019ve lived it. And that\u2019s what we\u2019re going to deliver with #TaxReform.\u201d How would the middle class fare under the Senate tax bill? (Broadly speaking, if the Senate bill became law, middle-income groups on average would see their after-tax incomes rise. But those increases are mostly modest and often less than that of the wealthiest households. And those increases for the middle class would eventually disappear in part because their tax cuts would expire after 2025, and because the Senate bill would slow inflation adjustments in the tax code.) In a telephone interview last week, Graham noted that getting tax reform through the Senate was one of the reasons Hatch ran for re-election in 2012. It is also why he brushes off questions about his retirement: \u201cI don\u2019t think he wants to say or do anything that would compromise his ability to get this bill done,\u201d Graham said. \u201cOrrin is one of the few people who was here in 1986 and he\u2019s always talked about doing something big on taxes,\u201d Graham said. \u201cHe is one of the few people on the Republican side who can remember the Reagan tax cut. He talks about that being one of his biggest accomplishments. He was a junior member then. Now he\u2019s chairman of the committee, so it feels like this is a kind of historic opportunity.\u201d \u201cIf he can shepherd the bill through the Senate, and get a compromise with the House, it would be one of the biggest accomplishments of any Republican,\u201d Graham said. Romney is widely being encouraged to run for Hatch\u2019s seat. In discussions with friends and former advisers, he has expressed strong interest in the post if Hatch were to retire. One source familiar with his thinking said Romney is \u201cmentally there\u201d in terms of being willing to run, but waiting for Hatch to decide. Another former top Romney adviser would only say: \u201cSenator Hatch will announce his decision, which he has not done yet. Mitt Romney has neither opened the door, nor closed it.\u201d Several Romney backers said there is genuine confusion about Hatch\u2019s desires, pointing to reports that he recently added new staff and has been raising money for his possible re-election campaign. At the end of the third quarter, Hatch had $4.7 million in cash on hand. He raised $3.4 million between January and the end of September, according to Federal Election Commission reports. The Hatch Election Committee spent about $10.6 million during his last re-election cycle in 2011 and 2012. In mid-November, Hatch touted the addition of four new staff members to his team that would add muscle to his Washington office. They include foreign policy adviser Jacob Olidort and Peter Carey, an attorney who joined Hatch\u2019s Judiciary committee staff to serve as counsel on criminal justice issues. Romney and Hatch are longtime friends but haven\u2019t spoken in several months, according to aides to both men. In deference to Hatch, more than a half dozen of Romney\u2019s former advisers refused to publicly discuss the possibility of a run by the former Republican presidential nominee until the senator announces his plans. Several said they were concerned any comment could be perceived as a suggestion that Hatch should retire. A hurdle was removed from Romney\u2019s path shortly before Thanksgiving when Boyd Matheson, a prominent Utah Republican and former chief of staff to Sen. Mike Lee, said he would not run for the seat. Hatch has told friends he is genuinely torn about the decision. His spokesman, Matt Whitlock, said Sunday that Hatch is \u201cfocused on leading the Senate\u2019s efforts to pass historic tax reform, confirming strong judges to courts around the country, and continuing to fight through the gridlock to deliver results for Utah.\u201d Whitlock added: \u201cHe has not made a final decision about whether or not to seek reelection, but plans to by the end of the year.\u201d For now, Hatch has to ensure that GOP defections don\u2019t sink the tax legislation. If Democrats unite against the bill, he can only lose three Republican votes. Here are the Senate Republicans who will decide the fate of the tax bill Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine has openly expressed concerns about including the individual mandate repeal in the bill, illustrating the difficult balance that Hatch must strike as he tries to appeal to conservatives without losing moderate support. Sen. Ron Johnson, a Wisconsin Republican, has said he doesn\u2019t support the current version of the bill but hopes it can be fixed in a way that he could ultimately back. Sen. Bob Corker, a Tennessee Republican, has said he can\u2019t support legislation that adds to the deficit. And Trump has predicted that Sen. Jeff Flake wouldn\u2019t support tax reform, though the Arizona Republican hasn\u2019t definitively said he he\u2019d vote. Chances of passage got a critical boost last week when Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski said she would support including the individual mandate repeal in the legislation. But a spokesperson said she hasn\u2019t made a final decision on the overall bill. Though Hatch styled himself as the champion of the little guy during his fiery exchange with Brown, he regularly argues that government spending should be curbed to prevent future generations from being saddled with debt.\u00a0In a blunt remark to a small group of reporters during the health care talks in May, Hatch said \u201cthe public wants every dime they can be given.\u201d \u201cLet\u2019s face it, once you get them on the dole, they\u2019ll take every dime they can,\u201d Hatch said. \u201cWe\u2019ve got to find some way of getting things under control or this country and your future is going to be gone.\u201d Over the years, Hatch has joked about his \u201cracing\u201d mind, his insomnia, and his quest for efficiency \u2013 recounting to reporters about how he would read memos on the stair master or walking to the gym. Once known for jogging from one meeting to another, Hatch\u2019s pace has slowed in recent years. But his relentless desire to succeed is still evident to those around him. Even now when surrounded by a scrum of reporters after stepping off the subway in the Capitol basement, he does not pause to talk \u2013 continuing on his way while taking questions. The former amateur boxer has shown both his toughness and irritability in several recent hearings. He chided his close colleague, Ron Wyden, the ranking Democrat on the Finance panel, for speaking out of turn \u2013 leading another Sen. Bill Nelson to note that the exchange was not within Hatch\u2019s \u201cnature\u201d as \u201ca gentleman.\u201d \u201cLet me be in control of this committee, not you,\u201d Hatch had interjected as Wyden tried to ask a committee witness a question. \u201cI\u2019m getting a little tired of being interrupted all the time and you calling on people and so forth,\u201d Hatch continued. \u201cI love you personally, but we\u2019re going to run this thing like it should be run.\u201d His impatience recalled his thoughts on his legacy during an interview with the Deseret Morning News in 2003: \u201cI don\u2019t waste a second,\u201d he told his home-state newspaper. \u201cWhen I go, people will have to say, \u2018He made every second count.\u2019\u201d With his party\u2019s future weighing on his shoulders, he\u2019ll be asked to prove that this week.

            "article_content": "GOP governors haven't figured out what to do about an increasingly toxic national political environment There are easy culprits for the GOP's struggles Republican governors sense a wave coming \u2013 and they\u2019re terrified it could wipe them out in next year\u2019s elections. The three dozen GOP governors gathering here this week for a Republican Governors Association meeting \u2013 including some close allies of President Donald Trump \u2013 said they were jarred by Democrats\u2019 easy victory in the Virginia governor\u2019s race last week. \u201cJust simply the intensity of the opposition \u2013 I think that\u2019s what was reflected in the Virginia vote,\u201d said Arkansas Gov. Asa Hutchinson. \u201cThat should be a wake-up call to all of our supporters in the elections next year.\u201d GOP tax plans could fuel the suburban revolt against Trump But the Republican governors haven\u2019t figured out what to do about an increasingly toxic national political environment that led to a surge in Democratic support in the Virginia suburbs last week. It carried Democratic Lt. Gov. Ralph Northam to a nine percentage point victory in what they\u2019d expected to be a close race against Republican Ed Gillespie, the former RNC chairman and White House adviser to President George W. Bush. Wisconsin Gov. Scott Walker said Republican governors are now trying to answer those questions after Gillespie, whom he called \u201can exceptionally good candidate,\u201d was so soundly defeated. \u201cWhat is driving the turnout? Is it a specific issue? Is it a specific region? Is it a specific type of voter? What impact of Washington?\u201d Walker said, without offering an answer. Democratic women won big on election night Walker, the current chairman of the RGA, credited Democratic political groups with shifting the party\u2019s Obama-era focus on national races to the state level. He cited billionaire environmental activist Tom Steyer, labor unions and the National Democratic Redistricting Committee, led by former Attorney General Eric Holder and backed by former President Barack Obama. \u201cMy biggest fear is not who my opponent\u2019s going to be,\u201d Walker said. \u201cIt\u2019s how much money is going to come from this Obama-Holder group, and how much can I offset that?\u201d The stakes are high for Republican governors in 2018. The party is defending 26 governor\u2019s offices in next year\u2019s elections \u2013 including some in blue states. Democrats see a digital breakthrough in Virginia wins There are easy culprits for the GOP\u2019s struggles. Backlash against President Donald Trump has led to a spike in Democratic fundraising and energized the party\u2019s base. The allegations facing Alabama Senate nominee Roy Moore threaten to damage the party\u2019s national brand. And the GOP-controlled Congress has not yet delivered on any of its major legislative promises. Vice President Mike Pence tried to mend the GOP\u2019s fences with a Wednesday afternoon speech in Austin, completely ignoring the challenging political landscape and promising that Congress would quickly deliver \u201cmiddle class miracle\u201d tax cuts. But even Trump\u2019s closest allies seemed alarmed by the political environment facing Republicans in 2018. Florida Gov. Rick Scott leads a pro-Trump super PAC and has long encouraged Republicans to embrace the President. But he is also considering a run against Democratic Sen. Bill Nelson in 2018 and he demurred Wednesday when asked whether Trump will be an asset or liability on the campaign trail. Will Roy Moore's troubles draw national Democrats into Alabama race? \u201cWe\u2019ll see what happens in 2018,\u201d Scott said. \u201cI don\u2019t know if I\u2019m going to be a candidate. We\u2019ll worry about that next year,\u201d Scott said when asked if he would want Trump to campaign with him against Nelson next year. Asked if Trump could help other Republicans on the 2018 ballot in 2018, Scott said, \u201cYou\u2019d have to ask them.\u201d Scott lashed out at the Republican-led Congress, saying that \u201cDC needs to do exactly what they said they were going to do.\u201d Scott was also critical of how Congress is handling tax reform, saying lawmakers should \u201cquit having a grand bargain\u201d and \u201cdo what you can get done today.\u201d Democrats' chances of taking the House suddenly look a lot better \u201cThese ideas that you\u2019ve got to have this gigantic change never happens. These grand bargains never happen,\u201d Scott said. To be sure, tax cuts are more popular with the Republican governors than the House and Senate efforts to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act were. Those proposals ran into a buzzsaw of Republican opposition at the National Governors Association meeting in Rhode Island over the summer. But none described them as the political panacea that Capitol Hill Republicans see in tax cuts \u2013 a way to buoy a wavering base and an antidote to claims that  the GOP hasn\u2019t passed any major legislation even with full control of the government. Republican governors across the country have already cut taxes in recent years, Walker said. \u201cIt\u2019s a pretty compelling argument that (Congress) should do the same thing,\u201d he said. Democrats are weaponizing the health care debate Still, shortly after Scott\u2019s critical comments in Texas, news broke in Washington that Republican Sen. Ron Johnson of Wisconsin was opposed to the GOP\u2019s tax legislation \u2013 one of just three votes Republicans can\u2019t afford to lose in order to secure 50 GOP votes and pass the legislation. An hour after the Johnson news broke, Pence took the stage at the RGA in Austin and pledged that tax cuts would pass by the end of the year. Pence began his speech by praising Trump, earning polite cheers from the audience of hundreds of lobbyists and governor\u2019s office staffers. Then, in another moment that ignored the political realities facing Republicans, he heaped praise on Chris Christie, New Jersey\u2019s outgoing governor. Christie is leaving office with approval ratings in the teens \u2013 which make him the least popular governor in America. His lieutenant governor, Kim Guadagno, was soundly defeated last week by Democrat Phil Murphy in the race to replace him. Ignoring the election results, Pence said he wanted to \u201cpay a debt of gratitude and to commend the great leadership of Gov. Chris Christie.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Lawmaking on Capitol Hill is often compared to sausage-making because the process can be grisly and gross and, at least for the idealists out there, enough to turn your stomach inside out. Let\u2019s start with why it gets so messy. When lawmakers decide to go big, they need to stitch together the smaller bits to satisfy their colleagues. If a particular group, or faction, wants one thing, the sausage chefs often tie it to another \u2013 something the first bloc might not want but are willing to swallow to assure their primary goal. Deals get done, then bills get passed. Or they don\u2019t, and they don\u2019t. It all depends on legislators finding the right balance, and binding up the necessary votes. For Senate Republicans this year, the \u201cyeas\u201d have been tough to corral. They couldn\u2019t find the 50 required, a lower threshold created by some legislative jujitsu called \u201cbudget reconciliation,\u201d to unwind Obamacare despite months of trying. Now they\u2019re at it again, same rules, attempting to pass a sweeping tax cut for corporations, the wealthy and parts of the middle class. Here\u2019s the catch: Because they are using the budget reconciliation process (again), the legislation cannot raise the long-term deficit. It\u2019s for that reason, to say nothing of their past promises, that Senate Republicans are now putting on the menu a one-time-only seasonal special that links two difficult-to-swallow agenda items. The tax cuts are the key ingredient. But those alone, at least in the Senate\u2019s calculation, aren\u2019t enough. To keep it from crumbling \u2013 that is, to be sure the bill stays within the parameters of the budget rules \u2013 they\u2019ve added a money-saving repeal of Obamacare\u2019s individual mandate. Tied up into one, it looks to many Republicans in Washington like the dish for which they\u2019ve so long hungered. Now for the heartburn. The garroting of Obamacare \u2013 which could leave 13 million fewer people with health coverage, as a means of pushing through permanent corporate tax cuts (the individual cuts sunset) \u2013 is a recipe for political disaster. Neither piece of this bill, when taken alone, is popular, but Republican leadership seems to have convinced rank-and-file members that they\u2019re better off feeding voters something, anything, than nothing at all. In remarks last week, after a Republican wipeout on election night, House Speaker Paul Ryan said the Democratic victories only confirmed his \u201creading of the current moment.\u201d \u201cIf anything,\u201d he added, \u201cthis just puts more pressure on us to follow through.\u201d That\u2019s one way to spin it. Exit polls from Virginia suggested otherwise. At the end of nearly a year spent elbows-deep in a national fight over Obamacare, nearly four in 10 voters there said health care was the issue that mattered most to them. And that bloc broke heavily for the Democrat, Ralph Northam, by a 77% to 23% spread. Democrats around the country found similar success by pledging to protect or expand the current law. Knowing this \u2013 and, again, looking at the polls \u2013 suggests that Ryan\u2019s public assessment is either off-base or misleading. The fallout from the ongoing effort is going to be significant. Democrats will use it as a bludgeon. The campaign ads write themselves. Health coverage for a corporate tax cut? Yikes. (The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee is already fund-raising off it.) It\u2019s hard to imagine that the blowback isn\u2019t baked into Republican leadership\u2019s calculus. One-party control of Washington is hard to come by and all but impossible to sustain. If the GOP is indeed going to be washed out in a Trump-resistance-led wave next year, why (the cynical politico might ask) would they pass up a chance to do exactly what they\u2019ve always wanted? Given all that, this is probably the best way to make sense of the situation on Capitol Hill right now: The Republican majority, in need of a deal that 1) satisfies multiple voting blocs; 2) keeps with Senate rules and 3) delivers on long-held agenda items, is simply doing what needs to be done \u2013 2018 be damned. The process might be off-putting, and the results \u2013 whether or not the deals come together and the legislation moves \u2013 could cost Republicans their majorities in Congress, but with the work nearly done, it\u2019s becoming increasingly difficult to imagine Republicans will pass up a bite of the sausage.",

            "article_content": "Repealing the individual mandate has been up for consideration for weeks The move would raise revenue for the GOP tax overhaul proposal CBO: 13 million could lose coverage by 2027 compared to current law Despite nearly a year\u2019s worth of heartache, Republicans can\u2019t quit trying to repeal Obamacare. Senate Republicans plan to include a repeal of the individual mandate \u2013 a key piece of the Affordable Care Act \u2013 in their tax reform efforts. It\u2019s a move that dramatically raises the stakes for President Donald Trump and congressional Republicans, who are still looking for a single, substantial legislative accomplishment to deliver to the American people this year. Individual mandate repeal to be included in Senate's tax bill For Republicans, the benefits are tempting. If they can pull it off, it\u2019s a two-for-one victory. They will have overhauled the US tax code and taken a bite out of former President Barack Obama\u2019s signature legislative achievement, even if it falls short of the \u201croot and branch\u201d health care repeal many had vowed to see through. But if they fail, Republicans will enter the midterm election year with their message muddled, without a victory on tax reform, and having spent a year\u2019s worth of time trying and repeatedly failing to dismantle Obamacare with nothing to show for it but bad headlines. CNN Money: What repealing Obamacare\u2019s individual mandate means One Senate Republican, Susan Collins of Maine, warned her fellow party members to be wary of diving back into the health care fight and risk capsizing their tax reform efforts just as they were making progress. \u201cI personally think that it complicates tax reform,\u201d Collins told reporters as she left a GOP lunch Tuesday. Repealing the individual mandate has been up for consideration for weeks, but the discussion had been happening mostly behind the scenes as Republicans debated using an estimated $338 billion in savings to cover the cost of and finance additional tax cuts over the next decade. The mandate requires nearly all Americans to have health insurance or pay a penalty. But getting rid of it has a cost. Roughly 4 million fewer people would be covered in the first year the repeal would take effect, the Congressional Budget Office said last week, rising to 13 million by 2027, as compared to current law. Premiums would also rise by about 10% in most years of the decade, CBO said. Monday morning, President Donald Trump tweeted from a trip to Asia that he wanted to see the repeal of the individual mandate included. I am proud of the Rep. House & Senate for working so hard on cutting taxes {& reform.} We\u2019re getting close! Now, how about ending the unfair & highly unpopular Indiv Mandate in OCare & reducing taxes even further? Cut top rate to 35% w/all of the rest going to middle income cuts? Senate leaders and many House rank-and-file members appear to have embraced the position. \u201cWe had to get our members to where they were comfortable with it, and I think we are there,\u201d said Sen. John Thune, a Republican from South Dakota and member of GOP leadership. \u201cIt just makes the overall bill a lot more possible,\u201d said Sen. Roger Wicker, R-Mississippi. Introducing a repeal of the individual mandate into the tax debate, however, is a risky proposition for Senate Republicans who failed to repeal the mandate in July after three Republicans \u2013 Collins, Sen. John McCain and Lisa Murkowski \u2013 all voted against it. Even lawmakers who embraced repealing the individual mandate were keenly aware of the danger it could pose to their delicately crafted tax bill. After all, trying to re-write the health care law had proven to be a massive flop for Senate Republicans, a failure that has echoed across conservative talk radio and hurt the GOP with their donor class. \u201cI have some concern about mixing health care with taxes because the health care issues have been so difficult,\u201d said Sen. John Kennedy, a Republican from Louisiana who supports repealing the individual mandate as part of the tax bill. \u201cBut, it\u2019s really not health care that we are talking about. We are talking about tax.\u201d Paul Ryan says Corker will vote for tax reform despite Trump feud A key driver of the Senate Republicans\u2019 decision Tuesday was simple arithmetic: They need the money. As it stands now, their tax plan increases the deficit outside the 10-year window and that is against Senate rules if lawmakers want to use a process that allows them to pass the tax bill with just a simple majority. \u201cWhatever people want to do is fine with me. My concern is that we not generate deficits, so if it is something we could use to buffer \u2013 especially during the first 10 years \u2013 deficits, then I\u2019d be open to it,\u201d Tennessee Republican Sen. Bob Corker said. \u201cAs long as it\u2019s real. I know some people think it is a gimmick. I want to look into it more fully.\u201d For now, Republican senators who voted against the repeal of the individual mandate in July, aren\u2019t coming out against the latest plan as of Tuesday evening. McCain and Murkowski have said they are both still examining the newest proposal, with McCain said he was leaning toward supporting it. It\u2019s not just Republicans who will have to recalibrate their thoughts on the tax bill now that it\u2019s a hybrid tax-health care plan. The latest change could make it much harder to attract any Democratic support. \u201cThis is turning a tax bill into a health care bill,\u201d Sen. Ron Wyden, D-Oregon, yelled during a markup in the Senate finance committee Tuesday. \u201cRepublicans just can\u2019t help themselves,\u201d Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer said in a statement. \u201cThey\u2019re so determined to provide tax giveaways to the rich that they\u2019re willing to raise premiums on millions of middle-class Americans and kick 13 million people off their health care.\u201d While getting Democrats to sign on was always a longshot, moderate Democrats met with White House officials last week at the Library of Congress. The decision to include the repeal of the individual mandate will give Democrats a familiar arsenal of attack lines. In the days and weeks since Republicans first unveiled their tax bill, Democrats have tried to attack it as a tax cut for the wealthy and a major blow to the country\u2019s debt and deficit. Those talking points have failed to create the kind of grassroots groundswell that was seen during the health care fight when Republicans endured hours-long town halls where individuals would come and recount stories about how repealing Obamacare would affect their daily lives. But that may change now. Anger erupts at Republican town halls Re-introducing the repeal of the individual mandate also brings groups like AARP, doctors and major insurance companies out of the wood work to oppose the Republicans\u2019 plan. On Tuesday, just after Republicans announced they would include a repeal of the individual mandate, a number of health groups stated their united opposition in a letter to Congress. The news of the Senate change Tuesday reverberated across Capitol Hill where some House Republicans made a last-minute push to try to convince their leadership to include a repeal of the individual mandate in the House-version of the bill, something a few members had been pushing all along. But, House Majority Leader Kevin McCarthy signaled Tuesday night that he didn\u2019t expect the House rules committee to make the change. \u201cIf it\u2019s in the Senate, then there\u2019s the ability for conference,\u201d McCarthy said. \u201cI don\u2019t think you\u2019ll see it in ours this week.\u201d The view in the House is that the Senate must prove first it can actually pass a repeal of the individual mandate. The House already voted for it and passed it earlier this year. With tax vote Thursday, House GOP leaders ironing out last-minute concerns \u201cWe didn\u2019t want to complicate tax reform and make it harder than it otherwise would be, and in fact, it was really, the Senate was the issue, so, we\u2019re now seeing if the Senate has the votes to actually repeal the individual mandates,\u201d House Speaker Paul Ryan said on a Fox News town hall Tuesday. Kennedy said the Senate will get the job done. \u201cThis is totally different than health care,\u201d Kennedy said. \u201cNobody is standing up and saying, \u2018If you do this, I\u2019m not going to vote for the bill.\u2019 There has been none of that. Everyone wants to get to yes.\u201d CNN\u2019s Ted Barrett, Ashley Killough, Deirdre Walsh, Phil Mattingly and Tami Luhby contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "The prevailing theme on tax reform: Getting something done trumps doing nothing 'Everything is good until it's not' is a smart way of thinking through this process House Republicans are a little more than 24 hours away from voting on their tax proposal. Senate Republicans have introduced a politically toxic provision into theirs. The proposals differ quite a bit. And yet, aides in both chambers say they are largely on track. House leaders remain confident they have the votes, according to multiple aides. Senate leaders, even in the wake of bringing the repeal of Obamacare\u2019s individual mandate into their tax overhaul, believe they are in pretty good shape as well. The usual caveat that there really is still a long way to go, and it only takes a few senators to throw this into a tailspin quickly. But as it stands, Republicans are very much on the surging toward a major legislative victory \u2013 and not just in the House. In the end, this is probably the only question that matters from a strategic perspective. Here\u2019s how it was laid out to CNN by one source involved in the process: \u201cWe wouldn\u2019t have done it if we thought it would sink the bill outright. We\u2019ve got a lot of work to do, but our guys had a chance to shoot this down and they chose not to do it. After we pulled the trigger the conference responded well. Can\u2019t ask for much more than that.\u201d Bottom line: GOP aides describe early returns on this risky move as positive. If it holds, that\u2019s a big, big deal. CNN has spoken to dozens of aides and lawmakers involved in this process and all say some version of the same thing: they are stunned at how smoothly the process has gone up to this point. Adding the individual mandate into this is unquestionably a risky play, but what it is more than anything else is a true test of the only thing everyone seems to agree is responsible for the progress thus far: that the political imperative to do something \u2013 anything \u2013 trumps everything else. It trumps concerns about individual provisions. It trumps concerns about outside interest groups. It trumps concerns that the plans will increase taxes for some. It trumps concerns that they will be undercut by the president at one point or another. \u201cFailure has a way of sharpening the senses,\u201d was how one aide put it. \u201cAnd so does the risk of losing one\u2019s election.\u201d Revenue. Period. GOP leaders in both chambers \u2013 despite the President\u2019s repeated urging, both publicly on Twitter and, sources tell CNN, in private calls with top Republicans, were extremely wary of adding the health care into an otherwise smooth running process. But finance committee Republicans, along with leaders, came the conclusion the siren song of $338 billion in deficit savings (which the Congressional Budget Office projects repealing the mandate would create) was too difficult to resist. The benefit of what they could add to the bill policy-wise, along with very real budget rule compliance issues, left it an option aides say they simply had to pursue. \u201cIt\u2019s not like there\u2019s a lot of places you can find an extra $300 billion laying around,\u201d one aide told me. The added benefit of potentially accomplishing a separate significant policy goal at the same time as the tax overhaul is appealing to many in the rank-and-file as well, who still have the health care failures seared into their memories and are reminded of them every day by constituents and donors. Two numbers: 13 million and 10%. The former, the number of individuals fewer that would have health insurance over the course of 10 years, according to CBO. The latter, the amount the CBO projects premiums would go up in the majority of years in that 10 year window. Those are the kinds of numbers that helped sink the Obamacare repeal effort, motivated Democratic grassroots to rain down opposition in phone calls, town halls and protests. Revving up a Democratic base that hasn\u2019t seized on the tax issue in the way they did health care is something GOPers have been nervous about for weeks. And you better believe this will do that. All eyes are on the three senators who effectively sank the Obamacare repeal efforts \u2013 John McCain, Lisa Murkowski and Susan Collins. McCain told reporters he was leaning yes on the bill, and that the inclusion of the individual mandate repeal wasn\u2019t a significant problem. Both Collins and Murkowski voiced concerns about the premium increases that may result from the repeal, but notably, neither rejected the idea outright. According to several GOP senators and aides, one of the ways GOP leaders will attempt to assuage concerns about rate increases will be to separately put the health care compromise legislation from Sens. Lamar Alexander and Patty Murray on the floor. There are two holes in that process, according to aides in both parties: The budget, which serves as the vehicle for the tax overhaul, also included reconciliation instructions for the Senate energy and natural resources committee to come up with $1.1 billion in deficit savings or revenue. Murkowski is the chair of that committee. Murkowski has been pushing for years to open up Alaska\u2019s Arctic National Wildlife Refuge to oil and gas drilling. It just so happens that to comply with the reconciliation instructions that Murkowski has drafted a bill that does just that. Tough to overstate how big of an issue this has been for her. She now has the vehicle to get it done, finally. Pretty tough to vote against that in the end. The Senate finance committee released the revised version of its bill late Tuesday night. Here are the highlights: The revised version of the bill creates a massive future fiscal cliff. All of the individual tax cuts, plus the higher standard deduction, plus the repeal of the alternative minimum tax, would sunset on December 31, 2025. This is being done entirely for reconciliation compliance purposes \u2013 this is how you squeeze a bill of this magnitude inside the requirements that it doesn\u2019t add a penny to the deficit after 10 years. GOP aides tell me there\u2019s no way Congress would allow massive, across the board tax increases. But man, oh man, is that quite a cliff \u2013 and a lot of faith future congress will actually get something done. The expiring tax cuts, plus the shift to a less generous inflation measure, ensures that the analyses of the final years of the decade will look particularly bad for Republicans \u2013 as in, significant tax increases. Expect Democrats to highlight that and for it to become a major political issue for Republicans \u2026 fast. By the way: The revised version solidifies that the corporate rate, slashed to 20% from 35%, would be permanent. Of note: There are lots of potential sweeteners for lawmakers and industries in the revised bill \u2013 nothing dramatic, but provisions with a very clear purpose. See \u2018em all here. As noted, House leaders feel like they\u2019re well on their way to passage of their tax proposal Thursday. They will spend Wednesday debating the rule for the bill, then take the bill up Thursday. The House chose not to add the individual mandate repeal for a couple of reasons \u2013 one, they want the Senate, which has been the graveyard for health care proposals up to this point, to prove they can actually get it done first. Probably more importantly: they believe they have the votes on their proposal. No reason to screw around with it. As one aide put it plainly: \u201cDon\u2019t mess with the count when the count is good.\u201d Bottom line: House leaders will agree to keep the mandate repeal in if it gets through the Senate. \u201cEverything is good until it\u2019s not\u201d is a smart way of thinking through the legislative process. Top GOP aides think things are in a good place right now, but our fully aware that things can spin out quickly \u2013 very quickly. Here\u2019s a partial list of the very serious potential problems are still very much in play: Yep. House on schedule to finish this week. Senate on schedule to finish its committee markup this week. Senate on schedule to vote the week after Thanksgiving. Then both chambers will reconcile their proposals.",

Sherrod Brown of Ohio told reporters. Tax reform state of play: Republicans\u2019 math problem The President\u2019s phone call was a surprise to Sen. Joe Manchin, who organized the meeting. Trump called in through Cohn\u2019s phone, and Cohn put him on speaker. Trump spoke for about 10 minutes during what was the 6 a.m. hour local time in South Korea. Sen. Tom Carper described the call as \u201ca nice touch,\u201d but said that Trump did more talking than listening on the call, while Cohn and Short fielded more of the questions and comments. Sen.

            "article_content": "This will be the first ACA open enrollment without President Obama Tech giants hit the Hill to talk possible 2016 election interference and Russia The debate on the so called millionaires tax -- will it be in Wednesday's tax plan? Obamacare enrollment without Obama, the lobbying frenzy around tax reform, the President\u2019s huge Fed chair choice and two big hearings on the Hill: it\u2019s all in our \u201cInside Politics\u201d forecast, where you get a glimpse at tomorrow\u2019s headlines today. It\u2019s open enrollment season, including the first sign-up period for the Affordable Care Act \u2013 or Obamacare \u2013 without President Obama in the White House. That raises a number of big questions \u2013 including whether the GOP administration will conduct outreach and other steps considered critical to raising awareness about the enrollment period and its requirements \u2013 despite the President\u2019s open opposition to the law. Just Saturday, for example, the President tweeted this: \u201cAs usual, the ObamaCare premiums will be up (the Dems own it), but we will Repeal & Replace and have great Healthcare soon after Tax Cuts!\u201d Perry Bacon of FiveThirtyEight ticked through the questions for the administration, and the domino effect on states where there is political support for the health care law. Officials believe they might need to step up their efforts because of the cooler views of the Trump administration. Bacon called it, \u201cObamacare enrollment without Obama,\u201d and said the White House is the first reaction you\u2019ll want to watch. \u201cDo they try to encourage people? Do they not encourage people, or something in between that? And secondly, we\u2019ll see states like California and New York, states that are very liberal, how will they handle this? \u201cWill they ramp up Obamacare enrollment on their own to make up the fact that the feds don\u2019t do it?\u201d The GOP tax reform plan is already a job creator \u2013 for lobbyists trying to influence the legislation. And as a multimillion-dollar lobbying frenzy kicks into gear in Washington, some fights are viewed as more time-sensitive than others. Take the so-called \u201cmillionaires tax.\u201d Speaker Paul Ryan is open to the idea, which would add a fourth rate to the tax plan. President Trump, too, has suggested he would accept such a change. The politics are obvious: Adding a new millionaires tax would be a GOP buffer against Democratic complaints that the GOP talks a lot about the middle class but is trying to deliver a giant gift to the wealthy. But a host of conservative forces \u2013 from the Wall Street Journal editorial page to business and conservative groups \u2013 call the new tax punitive and bad policy, and they are now racing the clock trying to make their case. Yes, in theory it will be weeks if not months as the tax debate winds through Congress. But when it comes to the millionaires tax, the opponents are convinced their most critical test is the next 72 hours. The official House proposal is being drafted in secretive meetings this weekend, with the unveiling planned for Wednesday in the House Ways and Means Committee. Those who oppose the millionaires tax view this behind-the-scenes period as their best hope. If the new tax is not in the bill, they believe it will be hard to get enough Republican votes to add it later. More importantly, if the legislation released Wednesday does include a new millionaires tax, those who oppose it believe it will be near impossible \u2013 given the politics \u2013 to find the votes to strip it out once the debate becomes public and changes require votes that can and will be used in future campaigns. Big technology firms face public questioning on Capitol Hill in the week ahead, and their performance is critical as lawmakers debate whether new regulations are needed because of Russia\u2019s use of social media to influence the 2016 election. Facebook, Twitter and Google loathe the idea of more government regulation. They also, however, do not have a track record of transparency, so how they explain what happened \u2013 and what new steps they plan in the future \u2013 will be a giant factor in the debate in Congress. Julie Pace of The Associated Press detailed the stakes for Big Tech: \u201cRepresentatives from these companies are going to be appearing before lawmakers and they\u2019re going to be grilled on two fronts that are related: one, how Russia tried to use these these platforms to influence the presidential election and two, the questions about the overall lack of transparency that these platforms have for their advertising for some of their users. \u201cYou\u2019ve seen Facebook and Twitter try to get ahead of these hearings by announcing some new steps,\u201d Pace said. The Trump administration is sending two key members of its national security team to Capitol Hill this week to take part in a long overdue conversation. Is it time for Congress to pass a new Authorization to Use Military Force (AUMF) \u2013 laying out the goals, and restrictions, for US military personnel operating in dicey areas around the world? The question has added intensity in the wake of the Niger ambush that left four US servicemen dead, as more and more lawmakers not only want answers about what happened but also argue it is irresponsible that Congress has not voted on an AUMF since shortly after the 9/11 attacks 16 years ago. With Secretary of Defense James Mattis and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson due to testify this week, Karoun Demirjian of The Washington Post discussed the mood in Congress. \u201cCongress has not been pleased with how quickly they were read into what happened [on Niger],\u201d Demirjian said. \u201cThere were concerns about the Pentagon changing its counterterrorism strategy to expand the rules of engagement. That may kick some lawmakers into higher gear in terms of trying to regulate what the administration is going to do in its military engagement.\u201d President Trump promises to name his pick to be chairman of the Federal Reserve this week, and just the use of the term \u201cchairman\u201d speaks volumes. Janet Yellen is the current chairwoman, and among three finalists interviewed by President Trump. The President, though, is said by sources close to the process to be strongly inclined to nominate Jerome Powell to the post. Jennifer Jacobs of Bloomberg shared reporting on how not reappointing Yellen to a new term would not only end a bipartisan tradition \u2013 but also end an historic tenure. \u201cA White House official told me he realizes how consequential this is. This is one of the most important decisions of his first year. Janet Yellen, of course, is the current Federal Reserve chairwoman. She was the first woman appointed to that job,\u201d Jacobs said. \u201cThis is a really important  to women in the financial world, to have her there, breaking the glass ceiling. It doesn\u2019t look like he\u2019s leaning toward her, which would break three decades of tradition. Usually presidents will keep the Fed chair that they inherit when they become president.\u201d",

            "article_content": "The President will lunch Tuesday with lawmakers He spent much of the summer blasting them President Donald Trump\u2019s feud with GOP Sen. Bob Corker re-erupted Tuesday, threatening to sour an effort to pull the President and Capitol Hill Republicans together to spark momentum behind a crucial push for tax reform. The President accused the Tennessee senator of enabling President Barack Obama\u2019s Iran deal \u2013 shading the facts on that issue \u2013 and of now fighting tax cuts. Bob Corker, who helped President O give us the bad Iran Deal & couldn't get elected dog catcher in Tennessee, is now fighting Tax Cuts.... ...Corker dropped out of the race in Tennesse when I refused to endorse him, and now is only negative on anything Trump. Look at his record! \u201cBob Corker, who helped President O give us the bad Iran Deal & couldn\u2019t get elected dog catcher in Tennessee, is now fighting Tax Cuts,\u201d Trump said, adding \u201cCorker dropped out of the race in Tennesse when I refused to endorse him, and now is only negative on anything Trump. Look at his record!\u201d Corker tweeted right back at Trump. \u201cSame untruths from an utterly untruthful president. #AlertTheDaycareStaff,\u201d he wrote in a biting tweet. Same untruths from an utterly untruthful president. #AlertTheDaycareStaff This latest dust-up comes as Trump is set to attend lunch Tuesday with lawmakers he spent much of the summer blasting for failing to enshrine his political agenda. Some have been critical over his chaotic, unpredictable method of governing, but Trump hopes to woo them to finally rack up a genuine legislative win on tax reform. The atmosphere will be especially charged because a number of Trump\u2019s hosts fear a 2018 primary challenge from populist, nationalist candidates in his own image, being recruited by his erstwhile political guru Stephen Bannon. Others, like Corker, have questioned Trump\u2019s fitness to serve as commander in chief. While the meeting will highlight political and temperamental divides between Trump and Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and his troops, both sides have enough at stake to bury their mutual resentment and work together. Steve Bannon celebrates Moore's win The President needs a win to avoid the embarrassment of a barren first year of his term that has undercut his claims to be the ultimate deal-maker and raised doubts about his capacity to deliver on big campaign promises. Establishment Senate Republicans are even more desperate, striving for an achievement to appease GOP primary voters that could blunt the attacks of Bannon\u2019s shock troops in his \u201cseason of war\u201d against his own party. Sen. John Thune, a member of the Senate Republican leadership, told CNN\u2019s Ted Barrett that Trump would do well to show the senators he wants to be a \u201cconstructive partner\u201d in the wake of a truce that emerged after a joint news conference between the President and McConnell in the White House Rose Garden last week. \u201cIf you have people running for re-election next year \u2026 the best thing you can go back and talk about is that you\u2019d gotten results. I think to the degree that President delivers that message, it will be very well received by Republican senators,\u201d Thune, of South Dakota, said. Sen. David Perdue, a Georgia Republican, told CNN the President did not need to make a \u201crah-rah\u201d speech but should make the point that the challenge before Republicans was bigger than tax reform \u2013 it was about their capacity to improve their lackluster performance to show they could govern. \u201cPeople back home are apoplectic that the Republican Senate is not backing this President\u2019s agenda \u2026 People didn\u2019t elect Donald Trump because they are enamored with Congress. Just the opposite, I believe. That\u2019s how I was elected,\u201d Perdue said. And Louisiana Republican Sen. John Kennedy told CNN\u2019s Lauren Fox he would like to hear a commitment from Trump that he will go to the mat selling whatever the tax plan is to the American public. \u201cWhat I\u2019d like to hear from the President is first of all what his priorities are. I mean everyone knows what the buffet looks like, but we can\u2019t all have a dish of everything,\u201d he said. \u201cI\u2019d like to see him make as many visits to as many states as he possibly can and for the next three months I\u2019d like to hear him talk about three things: tax reform, tax reform and tax reform.\u201d But the magnitude of the tax reform push is already raising questions about whether the White House and Hill Republicans can avoid the discord that turned the party\u2019s health care push earlier this year into a disaster. Trump so far has adopted a similar approach to the failed Obamacare effort, talking up the historic nature of the tax legislation and lacing it with superlatives but also again giving the impression he is not up to speed with the policy details. For instance, he President told GOP House members on a conference call on Sunday that they were \u201con the verge of doing something very, very historic\u201d after promising Fox Business News in an interview \u201cthe biggest tax cuts ever, in the history of this country.\u201d But he also warned in the call that if Capitol Hill Republicans did not pass a tax bill, they will face defeat in the midterm elections in November 2018, a congressional source told CNN\u2019s Jamie Gangel. But aside from a pledge to cut corporate taxes to 20%, calls to abolish the estate tax and a simplification of tax brackets, much remains unknown about the nuts and bolts of the tax plan. It\u2019s reminiscent of the Obamacare repeal debacle. Just a few months ago, Trump was promising \u201cwonderful\u201d health care, with lower deductibles, lower premiums, better care and coverage for all, promises that he found impossible to reconcile in the failed repeal effort. At several key moments of the health care deliberations, Trump\u2019s interventions and lack of specific policy knowledge became a liability, multiple congressional staff members told CNN at the time. When it came to details, Trump \u201cdidn\u2019t know, didn\u2019t care, or both,\u201d one source had said. It\u2019s possible that the chastening experience of health care reform\u2019s failure could prompt Trump to become more engaged on the tax issue. Given his long experience in business, the tax code is also closer to the President\u2019s area of expertise than the intricacies of the health insurance industry. And, the urgency of the tax reform debate for Republicans could help to paper over cracks in the Republican coalition. GOP deficit hawks are now willing to embrace a plan that does not immediately pay for itself in order to get something done. Rep. Mark Meadows, a fiscal conservative and member of the Freedom Caucus that helped scupper the leadership\u2019s Obamacare repeal plans, signaled flexibility over the tax plan Monday. \u201cWe are perhaps at some short-term exposure on the deficit side of things,\u201d Meadows told CNN\u2019s Wolf Blitzer. But the White House has yet to solve the key impediments to building support for the tax plan. So far, outlines of the legislation suggest a fairly standard GOP tax bill that will ease the way for corporations and offer net advantages to the most wealthy in society \u2013 an opening that Democrats are already exploiting. Yet Trump\u2019s appeal during the campaign was anchored partially on his promise to be a champion of blue-collar voters in the Midwest and middle-class Republicans elsewhere. That\u2019s one reason why the President shot down Monday a report that the ceiling on tax-free contributions to retirement plans could be drastically cut under the tax reform effort. \u201cThere will be NO change to your 401(k). This has always been a great and popular middle class tax break that works, and it stays!\u201d Trump tweeted Monday. There will be NO change to your 401(k). This has always been a great and popular middle class tax break that works, and it stays! In another effort to show that the President was looking out for his core voters, his budget chief Mick Mulvaney told Fox News Sunday that Trump had repeatedly ruled out cuts to entitlement spending to pay for tax cuts. Mulvaney said Trump told him: \u201cI promised people I wouldn\u2019t change Social Security. I\u2019m not going to do it.\u201d In another possible sign that the White House is seeking to reconcile Trump\u2019s promises with traditional GOP tax policy, Axios reported that the plan could retain the current tax rate of 39.6% for those earning more than $1 million. The move could partially dampen Democratic attacks that the tax plan represents a huge give-away to Trump and his rich friends, though it would disappoint traditional fiscal conservatives in the GOP. CNN\u2019s Ted Barrett and Lauren Fox contributed to this story.",

            "article_content": "Quietly, in the final hours of the Senate budget debate last week, a dam of sorts broke, with House GOP leaders agreeing to small-ish technical changes to the Senate budget that would allow them to pass it as is. Minor as it seemed (the substitute amendment that contained these changes was approved with little fanfare), this was one of the more important moments of the tax reform debate so far. CNNMoney: Trump promises tax reform won\u2019t impact 401(k) plans It showed the House, most notably the chamber\u2019s conservative block, willing to back off a centrally held tenet of their ideological beliefs in order to clear the path for tax reform. In other words, the political imperative that this must move at all costs, actually showed itself, for now, to be true. For GOP leaders, it\u2019s a huge signal. And it\u2019s also a big logistical boost. The House and Senate negotiations to reconcile the budget would\u2019ve taken a week or two. Now the House is slated to pass the budget this week. And that means tax reform will start in earnest next week. * Expect the budget vote by Wednesday, if GOP leaders feel like they have the votes (and * they feel confident right now they\u2019ll get there.) * House Ways and Means Republicans will huddle again twice this week on the details of the bill * Expect the Ways and Means Republicans to release their tax reform bill as early as next week, aides say. This, obviously, is a huge, huge deal. And yet \u2026 Don\u2019t believe this was an easy thing. There\u2019s a reason the President had to get onto the House GOP conference call Sunday afternoon. Conservatives, who have staked so much principle-wise on these budget documents, are still very uncomfortable voting for the Senate budget. The President\u2019s message was crystal clear, per people on the call: Gotta move now. This is everything for us and our party and anyone running for re-election in 2018 (which is, you know, everyone in the House who isn\u2019t retiring). This was floating around, and it wasn\u2019t clear how much juice it had, but the backlash over the course of the last 72 hours has been an intense. And as such, the President put a stake in its heart Monday morning. At least that\u2019s what it appears, via his tweet: \u201cThere will be NO change to your 401(k). This has always been a great and popular middle class tax break that works, and it stays!\u201d There will be NO change to your 401(k). This has always been a great and popular middle class tax break that works, and it stays! Why was this floating around? Lawmakers need money to pay for this effort. Period. Every time someone gets angry about a change (see: state and local deduction repeal), that means GOPers are losing the money to pay for the bill. Again, tax reform is about brutally difficult trade offs. Despite the optimism created by the above, things like this are always a great reminder that the hard work is still to come. House Speaker Paul Ryan made pretty clear Republican were going to opt for the optional fourth bracket in their final plan. That doesn\u2019t mean a tax increase \u2013 in fact, the idea that has been kicked around has been to leave the rate at the current highest level, 39.6%. The big question has been the threshold \u2013 a natural cut off is those earning $1 million. From a messaging perspective, it\u2019s very helpful, aides acknowledge. From a revenue perspective, it\u2019s helpful as well. The big problem, of course, is falling away from the \u201ceveryone gets a tax cut mantra.\u201d Axios has a good rundown from Grover Norquist on this front. But aides say this has long been considered an option on the table. It makes sense from a revenue perspective. It makes sense from a messaging perspective. And there has been zero pushback from the White House on the idea, they add. It is not finalized yet, aides caution. But it is very much in play.",

House leaders updated members on the Senate\u2019s passage of its budget, which was revised at the House\u2019s request, and the House\u2019s plan to pass that budget this coming week during the call, which Vice President Mike Pence also took part in. House Speaker Paul Ryan told members that he wants tax reform enacted by the end of the year, and passing the revised Senate budget this week provides the best shot to get it done on that timeline. In an interview that aired on Fox News earlier Sunday, Trump dismissed Democratic leaders\u2019 assertions that the Republican tax reform proposal will hurt the middle class as \u201ctheir standard\u201d line and claimed the GOP proposal would bring the \u201cbiggest tax cuts ever in the history of this country.\u201d \u201cI think we are going to get our taxes,\u201d Trump told Fox Business Network\u2019s Maria Bartiromo. \u201cI think it is going to be \u2013 hopefully before the end of the year, but maybe much sooner than that. There\u2019s great spirit for it. People want to see it. And I call it tax cuts. It is tax reform also. But I call it tax cuts. It will be the biggest cuts ever in the histodry of this country. I think that there\u2019s tremendous appetite. There\u2019s tremendous spirit for it.\u201d In a USA Today op-ed on Sunday, Trump hearkened back to Ronald Reagan\u2019s tax cuts of the 1980s and proclaimed the \u201cera of economic surrender is now over.\u201d \u201cWe will cut taxes for hardworking, middle-class families,\u201d the President wrote, adding that the United States will \u201crestore our competitive edge so we can create better jobs and higher wages for American workers.\u201d The op-ed also claimed the plan \u201cwill bring back trillions\u201d of American dollars currently overseas, and will raise the average American family income by about $4,000. On Fox News, Trump called Democrats\u2019 critique that the plan will benefit the rich an \u201cautomatic talking point.\u201d He further zeroed in on criticism of the plan by fellow New Yorker, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer. \u201cI like Schumer, but before he even knows the plan he\u2019ll say, \u2018Oh this is for the rich,\u2019\u201d Trump said. \u201cSo he doesn\u2019t even know what the plan is, and he\u2019s screaming it\u2019s for the rich.\u201d The dig on the framework has been that while it is silent on many key details, those measures it does specify disproportionately favor the rich. Republicans have been trying to market tax reform as a boon for the middle class. House Speaker Paul Ryan said Friday that House Republicans plan to propose a new top income tax rate for high earners in addition to the 35% rate proposed in the recent tax framework negotiated by leading Republican lawmakers and the White House. That framework calls for just three tax rates \u2013 12%, 25% and 35% \u2013 but allows for the possibility of a fourth to ensure that tax reform doesn\u2019t help the rich at the expense of the middle class. Trump said in the interview that aired Sunday that he believes he has the votes to pass the tax reform plan, quickly adding that he thought Kentucky Republican Sen. Rand Paul, who voted against the Republican budget proposal to pave the way for those proposed tax cuts Thursday, \u201cactually is going to vote for the tax cuts.\u201d \u201cI think that other people \u2013 you know, we had tremendous enthusiasm this time,\u201d Trump said. \u201cHealth care I was told was tougher, but it was close. I mean, so far I would say, it\u2019s not even a contest. And I will tell you speaking of health care, I believe we\u2019re going to get that also. It will be in the form of block grants to the different states, and it will be a wonderful health care.\u201d Another attempt to overhaul US health care will come \u201ca little bit later, probably in three of four months from now,\u201d Trump added. \u201cBut I do believe we will have that long before the election in 18\u2019.\u201d \u201cAs far as taxes are concerned, you see what\u2019s happening,\u201d Trump said. \u201cIt\u2019s really doing well \u2013 great enthusiasm.\u201d CNN\u2019s Boris Sanchez and Jeanne Sahadi contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Hillary Clinton slammed what she called \u201cendemic\u201d sexism and misogyny in America during an interview with Fareed Zakaria, which aired Sunday. Clinton, who was interviewed by Zakaria on his show, \u201cGPS,\u201d said sexism was so inherent that she purposely hadn\u2019t highlighted her career history of fighting for women\u2019s rights when she ran for president in 2016. However, she admitted that with the benefit of hindsight, she \u201ccould have tried harder\u201d to do so. \u201cI\u2019m a middle-class girl from the middle of the country, and so I always struggled with like, OK, so what\u2019s my story.  And it suddenly dawned on me that I was the beneficiary of these radical changes in, you know, women\u2019s rights and opportunities that began in the \u201960s and continue and that I could have and maybe should have tried harder to tell that story,\u201d she conceded. \u201cI never thought there would be that receptive an audience, \u201d she emphasized. This was in contrast, she pointed out, to former Presidents Barack Obama and her husband, Bill Clinton, whose stories were more appealing to the public. \u201cPeople immediately saw this arc of, you know, poverty in Hope, Arkansas, from a biracial family in Hawaii, how really impressive and exciting their stories were,\u201d she said. Clinton said the election of Donald Trump, despite his \u201clevel of sexism,\u201d was \u201cExhibit A of what we\u2019re up against,\u201d and observed what she called \u201ca backlash against women speaking out. \u201c \u201cI think sexism and misogyny are endemic in our society,\u201d she said. \u201cYou see it online, as women express an opinion and then are totally deluged.  You see it in Silicon Valley, you see it in the media, you see it in a lot of places where women\u2019s advancement has gone very far, much further than it certainly seemed at the time when I was coming of age,\u201d she told Zakaria. However, she noted that she had been encouraged by those who \u201cpush back\u201d against sexism, especially men who are the \u201cfathers of daughters, and husbands of wives,\u201d who \u201ccare about fundamental fairness,\u201d and who support female expression. \u201cThere seems now to be a willingness by more and more women and girls to claim their rights in a very explicit way, not an apologetic way.  Not like, \u2018Oh, you know, excuse me, let me express my opinion,\u2019 but \u2018No, I have an opinion. I want to tell you what that opinion is,\u2019\u201d she said. However, Clinton lamented that the word \u201cfeminist\u201d still seemed to be \u201ca word nobody wants to use.\u201d \u201cFeminism is not about women having more rights.  It\u2019s about women having equal rights, in the workplace, in the politics of a society, in the culture, having the right to be yourself and to be able to express that, and to have that both appreciated and providing a platform to go as far as your talent and hard work will take you,\u201d she said.",

            "article_content": "Ex-Vice President Joe Biden has aggressively criticized President Donald Trump South Carolina would be a key part of any possible Biden presidential bid Former Vice President Joe Biden is recruiting friends into tough-to-win Southern races, campaigning with Democrats in Virginia and New Jersey and wading into superior court races in Pennsylvania. He has cast President Donald Trump as racist, told an LGBT crowd that \u201cwe have a hell of a lot of work to do\u201d and tweeted at Trump that \u201cthis has to stop.\u201d \u201cOnce again, we are living through a battle for the soul of the nation \u2013 a battle I thought was done and won,\u201d Biden said in late September in South Carolina. It\u2019s all led to questions about whether Biden, who bypassed a presidential campaign in 2016, will seek the Democratic nomination in 2020. Increasingly, Democrats have looked to a wide field of younger figures to lead its anti-Trump message and tactics. But among the party\u2019s elders with national stature, Biden has been much more of a presence on the campaign trail than former presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton and the 2016 Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton \u2013 and a much more direct critic of Trump, particularly on foreign policy. Biden is set to campaign for the Democratic candidates in this year\u2019s two governor\u2019s races \u2013 Thursday for Phil Murphy in New Jersey, then Saturday for Ralph Northam in Virginia. Obama returns to campaign trail for Northam in Virginia He\u2019s a sought-after surrogate for Democrats in the South. Biden recently visited Alabama to help Democrat Doug Jones launch his Senate campaign against controversial former judge Roy Moore ahead of a December special election. He also campaigned for Archie Parnell in a South Carolina congressional special election. Biden also has endorsed candidates in five targeted Virginia delegate races, one state Senate special election in Washington that would flip control of the chamber, one successful state senate campaign in Florida and a number of judges in Pennsylvania. And he is crossing party lines. Biden is set to award Arizona Sen. John McCain with the National Constitution Center\u2019s Liberty Medal next week in Philadelphia. The next day, he\u2019ll join Ohio Gov. John Kasich for a discussion about bipartisanship in Delaware. Both Republicans have been sharp critics of Trump and have called for more bipartisan cooperation \u2013 making them natural allies of Biden, who has decried Washington\u2019s partisanship. It\u2019s too early to tell, though, whether Biden\u2019s packed political calendar means he\u2019s considering a third presidential campaign in 2020, people close to him said. Biden is deeply concerned with the direction of the country under Trump and wants to have a voice in countering Trump, those people said. But, they cautioned, he isn\u2019t yet personally giving serious consideration \u2013 as he painstakingly did in the fall 2015, after the death of his son Beau Biden \u2013 to whether he wants to run for president in 2020. \u201cWe take it one day at a time,\u201d Biden\u2019s wife Jill Biden said while in Charleston. Biden is \u201ca political animal\u201d and his level of engagement \u201cisn\u2019t more than he\u2019s done in the past,\u201d said former Sen. Ted Kaufman, a close friend and adviser who was Biden\u2019s chief of staff in his Senate office for 19 years. \u201cPick a year at random over the last \u2013 what is it now, 40-some years \u2013 and you\u2019ll find him involved in appearing for candidate fundraising events, talking to people about whether they want to run, those kinds of things,\u201d Kaufman said. \u201cFrankly, this is way too early to start thinking about what you\u2019re going to be doing \u2013 whether he\u2019ll run for president or anything like that.\u201d These days, Biden works for both the University of Pennsylvania and the University of Delaware, heading a center and an institute bearing his name at each university. He is also continuing his work on cancer research, and preparing to roll out a new book. He is also traveling for speeches on other issues. He\u2019ll be at Rutgers University on Thursday for a discussion about sexual assault on college campuses \u2013 one that comes a day after he sharply criticized Harvey Weinstein, the Hollywood executive producer and Democratic megadonor at the Anti-Violence Project Courage Awards in New York City. \u201cMy father taught me that the greatest sin was the abuse of power: Mental. Physical. Or economic,\u201d Biden said there in his first comments about Weinstein since reports of his history of his sexual assaults emerged six days earlier. \u201cThe cardinal sin was for a man to use his power to abuse a woman or a child. It is disgusting. But because of the bravery of so many courageous women speaking up. Putting their careers at risk to save other women from similar abuse, this disgusting behavior \u2013 at least on the part of Harvey Weinstein \u2013 has been brought to an abrupt and justifiable end.\u201d Is the big post-vice presidential footprint a tea leaf to read in terms of Biden\u2019s own political future? Not really, Kaufman said. \u201cIt\u2019s hard to tell people this, but he\u2019s concerned about these issues,\u201d Kaufman said. \u201cHe\u2019s concerned about violence against women. He\u2019s concerned about our foreign policy. He\u2019s concerned about the middle class. He\u2019s concerned about these things.\u201d On political matters, the inner circle that speaks to Biden nearly every day includes former chief of staff Steve Ricchetti, now the managing director at Penn\u2019s Biden Center; longtime adviser Mike Donilon; Greg Schultz, a former aide now heading up Biden\u2019s American Possibilities political action committee; and Kate Bedingfield, who was Biden\u2019s communications director in his vice presidential office. His sister, Valerie Biden Owens, is also involved in his day-to-day political activities. At recent political events, Biden has raised local Democrats\u2019 eyebrows \u2013 and stoked chatter about 2020 \u2013 with his aggressive criticism of Trump\u2019s presidency. Biden \u2013 who has deep Democratic ties in South Carolina, a state that would serve as a linchpin in any potential run \u2013 made his second visit to the state of 2017 in late September for a Charleston NAACP speech. He also headlined a Charleston County Democratic Party fundraiser prior to the NAACP event and spoke with big donors and party operatives. \u201cWe saw the truth of this president when he pardoned Joe Arpaio of Arizona,\u201d Biden said during his remarks at the NAACP dinner. \u201cIt\u2019s moments like these that each of us has to stand up and declare with conviction and moral clarity that the Klan, white supremacists, neo-Nazis will never be allowed to march in the main street of American life. That we will not watch this behavior and go numb when it happens.\u201d At the dinner, which took place inside a ballroom a mere two blocks from the Mother Emanuel Church where a white supremacists shot and killed nine African-Americans in 2015, he called out Trump\u2019s response to the Ku Klux Klan rallies in Charlottesville, Virginia, and said that Americans have a duty to not tolerate this kind of intolerance. \u201cThis is a moment for this nation to declare what this president can\u2019t with any clarity, consistency or vision: There is no place in America for hate groups.\u201d \u201cThis just felt different,\u201d a Democratic operative in South Carolina who was in attendance for the speech said. \u201cHe was more outspoken than I\u2019ve honestly ever seen him and also I think he\u2019s \u2026 I think the embarrassment and the anger over what Trump is doing while in the White House, he feels it personally. I think having been in the White House for eight years, he knows all that can happen, good or bad. He feels some sense of duty.\u201d \u201cI heard from numerous people that they were in awe of the stance he took and the energy he had and the remarks that he made specifically at the dinner,\u201d said Amanda Loveday, the former state Democratic Party executive director. \u201cI got one text from a huge Hillary Clinton supporter saying that he was on fire. He definitely came down here and provided an outlook for Democrats on what could be next.\u201d The former vice president isn\u2019t a stranger in the Palmetto State. Former Charleston mayor Joe Riley, who held the job for 40 years, withheld his endorsement of Hillary Clinton in 2016 until he was sure Biden wouldn\u2019t run. And Dick Harpootlian, a former state party chair, is a close ally who tried to persuade Biden to run in 2016. Biden was in South Carolina earlier this year for the unveiling of a statue of former Sen. Fritz Hollings, whom he credited with convincing him to take office at age 29 after his wife and daughter were killed in a car crash and with arranging for Biden\u2019s swearing-in at the hospital where his sons were at the time. Then there is Biden\u2019s relationship with another senator. \u201cThe first time I took notice of him in South Carolina was when he delivered the eulogy of Republican Sen. Strom Thurmond,\u201d said 2015 Draft Biden co-chair Inez Tenenbaum, who was South Carolina\u2019s state education superintendent at the time. \u201cHis eulogy was remarkable and extraordinary and people felt such a connection with him at times. That\u2019s how it all began.\u201d Biden\u2019s upcoming events with Kasich and for McCain are other examples of the former vice president crossing party lines. \u201cDemocrats and Republicans alike are fans of Joe Biden,\u201d South Carolina state Rep. Justin Bamberg said. \u201cHe is very, very likeable. South Carolinians are old school, it\u2019s all about who you know down here. And he knows a lot of people and a lot of people know and respect him for his good reputation.\u201d The Draft Biden group was established in 2015 to get started on the ground should Biden decide to run. Many South Carolina Democrats joined in and played active roles. Several elected officials endorsed Biden even though he didn\u2019t run, and Loveday said that proves what could happen if he were to get into the 2020 race. Another South Carolina Democrat, state Rep. James Smith, became close with Biden back in 2009 because both he and Beau served overseas in the military during overlapping time periods. Smith, who last week announced he is running for governor, was a \u201cDraft Biden\u201d leader in 2015 and has urged the former vice president to run in 2020. But their friendship goes deeper than that, a source familiar with their relationship said. Biden was looking for elected officials who served overseas to correspond with Beau was about to deploy to Iraq. He was put in touch with Smith, recently returned from a tour of duty in Afghanistan. The two began speaking on the phone regularly and are still in touch. Biden urged Smith to run for governor. In an extensive interview with the Charleston Post and Courier, Biden said he is behind Smith. \u201cI have met a lot of guys in my career \u2026 but this is a guy, I swear to God, that I would trust with anything. This is a guy who I watched, he never puts himself before anybody else,\u201d Biden said of Smith. Many operatives say a James Smith campaign in 2018 could help build lists and an organizing structure that could be turned over to Biden\u2019s camp in preparation for 2020. If Biden were to run in 2020, Biden would still likely face a packed primary field, and wouldn\u2019t have even South Carolina locked down. Bryanta Maxwell, the President of the Young Democrats in South Carolina, said her group has been getting excited for 2020 and throwing around names of people they hope will make a run at taking down Trump. \u201cKamala Harris, of course. Maxine Waters\u2019 name has floated a bit. Cory Booker. Elizabeth Warren. Those are the main names that I\u2019ve been hearing in my circles,\u201d she said. \u201cObama brought something different to the table. He brought diversity. With him being an African-American male who grew up in a single family household and had to rise from the bottom to the top, a lot of young people these days relate to that story more so than they do with an old white man. If we have another candidate who can bring the excitement like that, it could turn things around,\u201d Maxwell said. One critical factor is Biden\u2019s age: He is 74 and would be 77 on Election Day 2020. Another factor is that he has run for president twice before \u2013 and both times he fell short of the Democratic nomination. Biden\u2019s calls for bipartisanship \u2013 and a past that includes eulogizing Thurmond \u2013 could also make him a poor match for an angry Democratic primary electorate seeking a fierce Trump critic. \u201cThe good news for Biden is that he had a very strong national network when he ran in 1988, and those people have been loyal to him ever since,\u201d one national Democratic strategist said. \u201cThe problem for Biden in 2008 was that he didn\u2019t really expand that network: He ran a campaign that time that was basically the same folks, 20 years later.\u201d \u201cHis challenge is not finding old friends to do events with,\u201d the Democrat said. \u201cHis challenge is finding new ones.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Trump will promote his tax plan at a Pennsylvania rally Wednesday Trump and congressional Republicans are desperate for a major legislative win In Washington, President Donald Trump is often his own worst enemy. Trump vs. Corker encapsulates GOP civil war He rarely misses a chance to berate elite Republicans in Congress for failing to enact his ambitious agenda. Yet his tweeted tantrums and fierce character attacks \u2013 often targeting his own team \u2013 directly undermine his chances of building a Capitol Hill coalition to get things done. On Wednesday, if he can avoid trampling over his own message as he so often does, Trump will try to ease that contradiction by using the power of the presidency in a unusually conventional way, to build support behind a top priority: tax reform. After days flinging insults at GOP Sen. Bob Corker, sniping at his Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and complaining about a bad rap from the press on his hurricane relief efforts, Trump plans to actually fixate on something that matters. Trump admin avoids discussing climate change while rolling back emissions rule In an airport rally-style event near Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, the President will gather truckers and business leaders to highlight his vows to cut middle-class taxes, lift the corporate tax burden and to ignite soaring growth. \u201cWhen your trucks are moving, America is growing,\u201d Trump will tell supporters, according to a senior administration official. \u201cAmerica first means putting American truckers first.\u201d The tax reform initiative is crucial for the President\u2019s hopes of finally notching a major legislative victory before the end of his first year in office. It means as much to Republicans who are desperate to show the spoils of their one-party rule in Washington to restive voters at the dawn of midterm election year. But there is an even more significant dimension to the tax push since it may be the last chance for Trump and Republicans to find common cause and to bind the deep wounds left by their acrimonious failure to repeal and replace Obamacare. Inside Steve Bannon's war against Mitch McConnell Failing to secure reforms would be certain to drive an even deeper wedge between a President who vowed to drain the Washington swamp and establishment lawmakers who already fear assaults from Trump-style insurgents roared on by Steve Bannon in primary races next year. Inside Steve Bannon\u2019s war against Mitch McConnell Given the importance of the issue, it might have got more of Trump\u2019s attention. But he\u2019s spent much of his time recently pulling at the fractures in his own party and waging culture-war fights about patriotism and kneeling NFL players. Since he launched the tax push in Indianapolis on September 27, Trump\u2019s cause has barely advanced. In fact, it may have slipped backwards. The trip will be Trump\u2019s first chance to bring the symbolism of his office to bear since his showdown with the Tennessee senator, who warned that his unpredictable temperament could ignite World War III, earning in return a new nickname from Trump: \u201cLiddle\u2019 Bob Corker.\u201d The Failing @nytimes set Liddle' Bob Corker up by recording his conversation. Was made to sound a fool, and that's what I am dealing with! While the feud indulges Trump\u2019s relish for a fight, it could also be counterproductive, since the narrow nature of the GOP\u2019s Senate majority means he can hardly afford to lose any allies. Corker has already expressed concern about the tax reform bill, warning he may vote no if it adds to the deficit. The Corker vs. Trump sideshow has dismayed many Republicans. \u201cI\u2019d like to see it stop,\u201d Missouri Sen. Roy Blunt told CNN Tuesday. Other Republicans are warning that Trump\u2019s scatter-shot attacks on people he is relying on to support his priorities will cost him a chance to build the foundations of a successful presidency. \u201cIf Donald Trump is fighting with Paul Ryan or Mitch McConnell or now Bob Corker, he is taking his eye off the ball for tax reform,\u201d CNN contributor and Republican strategist Doug Heye said Tuesday. It is clear that inside the White House, animosity toward Republican lawmakers runs deep, exemplifying the split between Trump, a Washington outsider, and those his allies see as establishment swamp creatures. \u201c(Trump is) calling on Congress to get their job done,\u201d said White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders on Tuesday. \u201cThey\u2019re on another vacation right now, I think that we would all be a lot better off if the Senate would stop taking vacations, and start staying here until we actually get some real things accomplished.\u201d Trump is selling his tax plan as a \u201cmiddle class miracle\u201d that will include sweeping tax cuts, a simplification of the code and a chance to unleash unheard of rates of economic growth. The plan calls for a corporate tax rate of no higher than 20% and hopes to lure corporations to repatriate profits earned abroad in a way that stems the flight of US blue collar jobs to low wage economies. But Democrats have argued that the plan is no more than a massive giveaway to the richest Americans, including Trump himself, laying the groundwork for a political battle that will likely rage through the end of the year. Previewing health order, Trump vows 'great, great' insurance Given the delicate reality of pre-midterm election politics, it\u2019s not easy to assess the chances of the bill, especially given that tax reform is among the most complicated tasks that Congress ever faces. Most Republicans are itching to vote for tax cuts. But Corker is now a wild card. And Republican Sen. Susan Collins could announce a run for Maine governor this week, and could therefore shirk at voting for a bill branded as huge giveaway to the rich by Democrats. But unlike in the Obamacare repeal effort, it\u2019s also possible that some Democrats running for re-election in red states won easily by Trump could defy their leaders and vote to gift the President a big win. CNN\u2019s Ted Barrett contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Republicans once again find themselves with few votes to spare in the Senate Some House members are worried about a tax plan that scraps certain deductions Republicans are well on their way to overhauling the tax code, but party schisms, red lines and inevitable local interests are already coming into sharp view. Last week, the Senate and the House took the first steps on tax reform. The House passed its budget on the House floor while the Senate moved its own version out of committee, a crucial step in unlocking the GOP\u2019s ability to use reconciliation for tax reform; that process allows the Senate to pass its package with only 51 votes. But almost two weeks after the GOP unveiled its framework for tax reform, the party is already grappling with the inevitable reality that for every tiny change leaders seek, a constituency is waiting in the wings to fight for or against it. \u201cPeople have become familiar with this code, they know how it works and when Congress is going to go in and change it, they are unsure if that change will work for them,\u201d said Sen. Mike Crapo, a Republican from Idaho and the Chairman of the Senate banking committee. Fresh off the loss on health care, there is also concern that GOP leaders have no room for error as they attempt to get a long-awaited legislative win. Using reconciliation, Republicans don\u2019t need Democratic votes, but they\u2019ll need all but two members to be on board, something that rank-and-file Republicans recognize is a liability for them. Already, Sen. Bob Corker, a Republican from Tennessee, has said he doesn\u2019t want the tax package to add to the deficit, a fiscal hard line that may be tough to comply with and will force the party into a place where it has to make serious tradeoffs in tax policy. Corker predicts that the party will need to find roughly \u201c$4 trillion in loopholes that have to be closed.\u201d While many conservatives have argued that tax cuts spur economic growth that will offset the loss of revenue, Corker argues that he thinks the party needs to be realistic about how much growth to expect. \u201cI want to make sure this doesn\u2019t add one penny to the deficit,\u201d Corker said. Corker also once again found himself publicly fighting with President Donald Trump over the weekend. And while this most recent spat between the two high-profile Republicans just barely touched the tax reform issue, it\u2019s difficult for the party to envision such legislation advancing without Corker\u2019s support. \u201cBob Corker gave us the Iran Deal, & that\u2019s about it. We need HealthCare, we need Tax Cuts/Reform, we need people that can get the job done!\u201d Trump tweeted Sunday evening. Bob Corker gave us the Iran Deal, & that's about it. We need HealthCare, we need Tax Cuts/Reform, we need people that can get the job done! Another Republican senator, Rand Paul of Kentucky, who became a \u201cno\u201d vote on the GOP\u2019s last version to repeal Obamacare, has also signaled his concerns with the current plan. In an op-ed in Breitbart, Paul argued that the GOP\u2019s framework cuts taxes for wealthy earners and the poor, but doesn\u2019t do enough to cut taxes for the middle class. \u201cI don\u2019t want to vote for a plan that cuts some taxes but raises them on others, especially not on the middle class. So I want everyone to see the errors in their plan, look for solutions, and come together for a plan that can pass,\u201d Paul warned. Donald Trump is playing zero-dimensional chess In the House, another piece of the tax framework has come under fire: the eradication of the state and local deduction. The deduction allows people to write off local and state tax levies on their federal returns, and Northeast Republicans in Congress \u2013 many of whom have constituents who pay higher local and state taxes in states like New Jersey and New York \u2013 want to preserve it at least in some form. Last week, Ways and Means Committee Chairman Kevin Brady and a handful of House GOP members dined at Ruth\u2019s Chris Steak House to discuss concerns over losing the deduction. RELATED: Who pays if Congress kills the state and local tax deduction New York Rep. Chris Collins, a Republican, told reporters that discussions are ongoing about ways to at the very least preserve a piece of it, but the balance is delicate. Collins has suggested that taxpayers could pick between taking the state and local deduction or the mortgage interest deduction on homes valued at less than $1 million. But, the fact remains that at some point, Republicans will have to eliminate deductions in the tax code in order to pay for their other tax cuts. Axing the state and local deduction is estimated to raise $1 trillion in revenue for the GOP\u2019s tax plan. These are the GOP sticking points on tax reform The fear from GOP leaders is compromising on revenue raisers now only makes the rest of the process harder later. Not to mention, finding another $1 trillion isn\u2019t easy. \u201cI think every one of these are going to be hard,\u201d said GOP Sen. John Thune of South Dakota. \u201cNone of this is easy. \u2026 I think right now our members need to just keep an open mind and keep things on the table and then at some point, when we really get into the nuts and bolts of this, we\u2019ll have to start making some decisions. But if you start saying now, \u2018I am not going to be for this or for that,\u2019 then you start getting into that slippery slope where every deduction becomes something that people want to save.\u201d Republican rank-and-file members desperate for a win on tax reform say that their colleagues need to keep their eyes on the ball. The GOP needs to reform the tax code or face a rough 2018 midterm election when donors and the base will wonder what the Republican Party has accomplished in Washington where they control the Executive and Legislative Branch of federal government. Republican Sen. John Kennedy of Louisiana offered this preview: \u201cI think once (we\u2019re) finished, some people are going to be happy and other people are going to be sad, but that\u2019s what you do when you reform the tax code.\u201d CNN\u2019s Deirdre Walsh contributed to this report.",

Tillerson\u2019s failure to deny the NBC report in a press conference on Wednesday may have finally severed his relationship with Trump, but his position has been weakening for months, despite his denials that he has been close to resigning. The President and senior staff members appreciate the poor political optics of yet another important official being shown the door, sources have told CNN. And ditching the secretary of state now could complicate Trump\u2019s reorientation of Iran policy expected to take place next week with his decertification of a nuclear deal. Tillerson has also been preparing Trump\u2019s tour of Asia in November. So Tillerson may cling on a little longer on the political equivalent of death row. But when his apparently inevitable departure does occur, it will come at a cost, both to America\u2019s already battered credibility overseas and to the cause of stable government in Washington. Abroad, Tillerson\u2019s departure could deepen confusion about US foreign policy and doubts about the administration\u2019s competence. At home, it may dismay foreign policy graybeards like Sen. Bob Corker who said this week Tillerson was one of a group including Defense Secretary James Mattis and Chief of Staff John Kelly, keeping the US \u201cfrom chaos.\u201d Establishment figures also worry that a vacancy at State could provide an opening for a hawk, someone like former UN envoy John Bolton, who might indulge Trump\u2019s wilder impulses. There is a critique common to many senior foreign officials and diplomats about the administration \u2013 they don\u2019t know who is running the show, understand its foreign policy strategies and are uncertain who to call in a crisis. Losing a secretary of state so quickly would exacerbate those concerns. \u201cIt\u2019s difficult to find out who is in charge or who to call on the phone,\u201d said a senior official from one key US ally recently. Upheaval in the national security team would also raise doubts about how Washington will handle several worsening crises. Tillerson has sought to keep open a channel of communication with North Korea amid a nuclear showdown exacerbated by Pyongyang\u2019s missile launches and Trump\u2019s incendiary rhetoric. The President, however, undermined his secretary of state last week by ordering him over Twitter to stop wasting his time in talking to Pyongyang. I told Rex Tillerson, our wonderful Secretary of State, that he is wasting his time trying to negotiate with Little Rocket Man... Tillerson has also been the most important US conduit with Russia, trying to stop a vital relationship between two nuclear powers from getting even worse. A senior administration official last month paid tribute to Tillerson\u2019s expertise on Russia, developed during his many business trips to the country as the CEO of ExxonMobil. With tensions at their highest since the end of the Cold War, with US and Russian troops in proximity on Syria\u2019s battlefields, Tillerson manages a channel of communication with Moscow that can be instantly activated in a crisis, the official said, speaking on condition of anonymity. Tillerson was the only US official to accompany Trump to his meeting with Russian President Vladimir Putin in Germany in July. And given the political constraints imposed on the White House by the special counsel probe into allegations of election collusion between the Trump campaign and the Kremlin, solid State Department links with Russia are even more important than usual. Yet despite the disruption his departure would cause, Tillerson hasn\u2019t exactly been blazing a trail of glory. US allies have been outraged by Trump administration policies, including the withdrawal from the Paris accord. It\u2019s quite possible he would hardly be missed. And his position appears untenable. \u201cRex Tillerson has been dealt a bad hand by the Potus & has played it badly. For both reasons he cannot be effective SecState & should resign,\u201d Richard Haas, President of the Council on Foreign Relations wrote on Twitter on Thursday. There\u2019s no doubt Trump has made Tillerson\u2019s job harder. For instance, in June, Tillerson called on Qatar\u2019s neighbors to ease a blockade against the US ally. Hours later, the President backed the position of Saudi Arabia and Bahrain that Qatar was guilty of sponsoring terrorism. Trump has also eroded Tillerson\u2019s authority by farming out State Department functions, for instance putting his son-in-law Jared Kushner, who has no diplomatic experience, in charge of a Middle East peace initiative. Philip Zelikow, a State Department counselor under former secretary of state Condoleezza Rice, said that \u201cobservant foreign governments have already formed their impressions about the President and about the secretary.\u201d The consequences of their latest spat are \u201clikely to be more internal, within the administration, adding that much more acid to the corrosive drip,\u201d he said. Tillerson has underwhelmed in Washington just as he has abroad. He\u2019s not seen as a fighter for his department on Capitol Hill, a factor that has deepened a crisis of morale at Foggy Bottom. He has seemed more fixated on his plan to cut the department\u2019s budget than global strategy. His hermit-like approach to the press has undermined US public diplomacy. The result is that Tillerson lacks the domestic power base and strong persona that could insulate him from Trump\u2019s capricious nature. \u201cTillerson has been in a difficult situation that he has made worse by the way he has conducted himself in office,\u201d said Derek Chollet, a former senior defense and foreign policy official in the Obama administration now with the German Marshall Fund. \u201cContrast him with someone like Mattis, who I think has a similar disposition in terms of his views on the US role in the world.\u201d Whoever is to blame, Tillerson\u2019s disconnect with Trump is especially damaging. A Secretary of State\u2019s authority rests on his relationship with the President. As it stands, the rest of the world believes that Tillerson thinks his boss is a moron and that Trump doesn\u2019t trust his top diplomat. That being the case, the crucial bond between the two already looks irrevocably fractured. Yet any new secretary of state would confront the same, possibly insurmountable challenge that Tillerson has experienced \u2013 the President himself. Tillerson\u2019s resume, character and approach would probably equip him just fine to work in a more conventional administration. The question his difficult tenure raises is whether Trump would allow any secretary of state who serves him the room to act, or whether even more fundamentally, the President actually believes in diplomacy itself.

            "article_content": "More than a year after being released from prison, Grimm announced his campaign Grimm pleaded guilty to tax fraud in 2014 and later resigned from Congress Michael Grimm, the former Republican congressman who went to jail for tax evasion, announced the launch of his campaign for his old seat representing Staten Island and parts of Brooklyn in New York on Sunday afternoon. More than a year after being released from prison after pleading guilty to tax fraud charges, Grimm announced his intention to take back New York\u2019s 11th Congressional District seat from his replacement, fellow Republican Rep. Dan Donovan, in front of a crowd in the New Dorp section of Staten Island. \u201cI have matured. I\u2019m tempered. I\u2019m wiser. But I\u2019m still the same guy you know yearning to serve you every chance I get,\u201d Grimm said during the campaign launch event. \u201cMichael Grimm always goes the distance.\u201d Beginning in 2015, Grimm served eight months in federal prison after pleading guilty to one count of tax fraud related to a Manhattan health food eatery, Healthalicious, he co-owned before taking assuming political office. Federal prosecutors say Grimm failed to report $1 million from his restaurant business in Manhattan prior to his 2010 election to Congress. \u201cI\u2019ve had a lot of time to reflect and for introspection. I\u2019m truly sorry if I let any of you down,\u201d Grimm told the crowd Sunday. \u201cI feel like I let your voice be abruptly taken away from you when I resigned. From the very bottom of my heart, I am sorry and I do love you.\u201d Grimm won re-election in November 2014 against former Brooklyn Councilman Domenic Recchia, but resigned six weeks later after pleading guilty. Grimm had stated he would \u201cabsolutely not\u201d resign, but did so after speaking with then-House Speaker John Boehner, who called the resignation \u201chonorable.\u201d The 11th Congressional District is made up of Staten Island and parts of southern Brooklyn, including the neighborhoods of Bay Ridge, Dyker Heights, Bensonhurst and Gravesend. Donovan was elected to finish out Grimm\u2019s term and was re-elected to serve a full term in 2016. Michael Caputo, a former top Trump campaign adviser who\u2019s now aiding the Grimm campaign, claims voters in the district are not pleased with Donovan\u2019s decision not to align with President Donald Trump and, he says, would welcome Grimm back to office. \u201cThe 11th Congressional District is Trump country,\u201d Caputo said. \u201cIt\u2019s time for Republicans who oppose the President to pay a price for that.\u201d Donovan voted against the President on the House\u2019s failed legislation to repeal and replace Obamacare and he opposes Trump\u2019s proposed tax overhaul, which Donovan said would impose burdensome taxes on the middle class residents of his district. A campaign official said many in the district see Grimm\u2019s prosecution as politically motivated. \u201cA good legion of Republicans on Staten Island have the same opinion of the political prosecution of Grimm as they do of Joe Arpaio and Dinesh D\u2019Souza and now the President of the United States,\u201d the campaign official said, adding that Grimm supports Trump. \u201cThe Department of Justice was weaponized against Congressman Grimm. Republicans, especially in strong Trump territory, have a unique perspective on a Department of Justice out of control.\u201d During his campaign announcement, Grimm made repeated reference to supporting Trump. Staten Island, which makes up the majority of the 11th district, voted for Trump by a 56.4% to 41.2% margin over Hillary Clinton in 2016, and the district is now the only Republican-held congressional seat in New York City. \u201cTogether we will go to Washington and have our President\u2019s back. We will support our President,\u201d Grimm said in attacking Donovan, who Grimm said is not doing enough to align himself with Trump. Before Grimm served time in prison for tax fraud, he was in the headlines for threatening to throw a NY1 reporter off a balcony at the US Capitol complex after the reporter questioned him about his campaign finances. Grimm later apologized to the reporter.",

            "article_content": "Clinton still finds ample blame to go around She admits she badly misjudged the environment in which she was running A raw and aggrieved Hillary Clinton takes ownership \u2013 to a degree \u2013 for her stunning 2016 loss to Donald Trump in her upcoming book, which offers a revealing look at the campaign through the eyes of the contest\u2019s loser. CNN purchased the book \u2013 \u201cWhat Happened\u201d (Simon & Schuster, 494 pages) \u2013 from a Jacksonville, Florida, bookstore a week before its widespread release. The defeated presidential contender offers a patchwork of explanations for what, exactly, did happen last year \u2013 some of which she insists were outside her control and some she concedes were her own fault. \u201cI go back over my own shortcomings and the mistakes we made. I take responsibility for all of them. You can blame the data, blame the message, blame anything you want \u2013 but I was the candidate,\u201d she writes. \u201cIt was my campaign. Those were my decisions.\u201d In a voice that swings from defiant to conciliatory to \u2013 at rare moments \u2013 deeply vulnerable, Clinton does assume ownership where the fault lines are obvious. And in overarching terms, she admits she badly misjudged the environment in which she was running and the candidate she was running against. New Clinton book blasts Sanders for 'lasting damage' in 2016 race But Clinton still finds ample blame to go around. She writes bluntly that sexism hampered her ability to reach voters effectively. She offers unvarnished assessments of those who have cast doubts on her campaign, including Vice President Joe Biden and Sen. Bernie Sanders, her former rival. And she singles out James Comey \u2013 a \u201crash FBI director\u201d \u2013 for direct and lashing criticism. The book also oozes with contempt for Trump, the campaign he ran and the President he has become. Clinton, who admits in \u201cWhat Happened\u201d that she suffered an inability to say what she really felt on the campaign trail, seems to drop many of those tendencies here. Clinton also opens up about her personal life with lengthy passages dedicated to her daughter, her mother and, most notably, her husband. She describes her marriage to former President Bill Clinton as one with \u201cmany, many more happy days than sad or angry ones\u201d and confronts all the worst public assumptions about the relationship. \u201cI heard it again on the 2016 campaign \u2026 it\u2019s just a marriage on paper now,\u201d she writes, adding \u201c(he is reading this over my shoulder in our kitchen with our dogs underfoot and in a minute he will reorganize our bookshelves for the millionth time \u2026 but I don\u2019t mind because he really loves to organize those bookshelves).\u201d In addition to bemoaning the fascination with her relationship, she lambasts media coverage of her emails, singling out The New York Times as a repeat and high-profile offender. And she wonders aloud why, after terms as first lady, US senator, secretary of state and two-time presidential candidate, the public still just doesn\u2019t seem to like her. \u201cWhat makes me such a lightning rod for fury? I\u2019m really asking. I\u2019m at a loss,\u201d she asks her readers, before concluding: \u201cI think it\u2019s partly because I\u2019m a woman.\u201d Clinton\u2019s memoir, her third, provides a narrative of a campaign that, in retrospect, was mismatched with the moment. She tells readers she has spent the months since her defeat reading studies, reports and news articles (all cited in her book) that offer suggestions at how her style of campaigning was lost on an angry and disillusioned electorate. In places, \u201cWhat Happened\u201d reads like the term paper of a student studying the most unpredictable loss in modern American politics. \u201cI think it\u2019s fair to say that I didn\u2019t realize how quickly the ground was shifting under all our feet,\u201d she writes. \u201cI was running a traditional presidential campaign with carefully thought-out policies and painstakingly built coalitions, while Trump was running a reality TV show that expertly and relentlessly stoked Americans\u2019 anger and resentment.\u201d Clinton makes frank admissions about the places she fell short. She acknowledges it was bad \u201coptics\u201d to deliver paid speeches to Wall Street banks after the financial meltdown last decade. She says her comment during a CNN town hall about putting coal miners out of business was the misstep \u201cI regret the most.\u201d And, as she has before, Clinton calls her decision to use a private email server during her time at the State Department as \u201cdumb.\u201d But while she claims that a host of factors \u2013 including her own shortcomings \u2013 led to headwinds against her, Clinton identifies the final week of the campaign, highlighted by Comey\u2019s revival of the email issue, as the moment that led to the bottom dropping out. \u201cComey\u2019s letter turned that picture upside down,\u201d Clinton writes about her tarnished image, which she said had gone from a picture of a steady leader to one compromised by scandal. In a lengthy middle section, Clinton unpacks Russia\u2019s meddling in the election, openly wondering whether a more forceful public response from then-President Barack Obama could have changed matters. And she describes her regret at not facing Russian leader Vladimir Putin as a US president \u2013 a form of vengeance she can now only imagine. \u201cThere\u2019s nothing I was looking forward to more than showing Putin that his efforts to influence our election and install a friendly puppet had failed,\u201d she writes. \u201cI know he must be enjoying everything that\u2019s happened instead. But he hasn\u2019t had the last laugh yet.\u201d In vivid color, Clinton also recalls the whiplash of the last 24 hours of the campaign, from the euphoria of her last full day of campaigning to the pain and uncertainty on election night. During their final event together, Clinton recalls Obama hugging her and whispering, \u201cYou\u2019ve got this. I\u2019m so proud of you.\u201d Her campaign, Clinton writes, was perilously vulnerable at the time, though, and Election Day was downhill after voting. She writes that as her husband was nervously \u201cchomping on an unlit cigar,\u201d she took a nap as the results were coming in. When she awoke, the \u201cmood in the hotel had darkened considerably.\u201d Obama, hours after extolling her campaign, urged Clinton to concede to Trump on election night, not drawing out the 2016 campaign any longer than necessary. Clinton writes that her call with Trump was \u201cwithout a doubt one of the strangest moments of my life.\u201d \u201cI congratulated Trump and offered to do anything I could to make sure the transition was smooth,\u201d she writes. \u201cIt was all perfectly nice and weirdly ordinary, like calling a neighbor to say you can\u2019t make it to his barbecue. It was mercifully brief \u2026 I was numb. It was all so shocking.\u201d While Clinton\u2019s book is full of praise for her Democratic colleagues, she also offers as blunt an assessment of their weaknesses as they offered of hers. \u201cJoe Biden said the Democratic Party in 2016 \u201cdid not talk about what it always stood for \u2013 and that was how to maintain a burgeoning middle class,\u2019\u201d Clinton writes. \u201cI find this fairly remarkable, considering that Joe himself campaigned for me all over the Midwest and talked plenty about the middle class.\u201d In describing her scrutinized marriage to the 42nd president, Clinton reveals deep resentments at the rumors and innuendo that have colored public speculation about the partnership since the late 1990s. Writing with pique, Clinton is unapologetic for wanting to keep the personal aspects of her marriage private, even in a world where the details of her husband\u2019s affairs have been widely aired. \u201cThere were times that I was deeply unsure about whether our marriage could or should survive,\u201d she wrote. \u201cBut on those days, I asked myself the questions that mattered to me: Do I still love him? And can I still be in this marriage without becoming unrecognizable to myself \u2013 twisted by anger, resentment, or remoteness? The answers were always yes.\u201d Clinton also appears to be wrestling with other demons throughout \u201cWhat Happened\u201d as she comes to terms with the aftermath of her devastating loss. Searching for answers, Clinton steadfastly insists that the woman who has spent decades persevering in a harsh spotlight won\u2019t be embittered by a final humiliating blow. In the same manner she has remained by her husband\u2019s side, Clinton writes she is intent on remaining in public life \u2013 despite its dark moments and uncertain payout \u2013 instead of seething in solitude. \u201cThere were plenty of people hoping that I, too, would just disappear,\u201d she writes. \u201cBut here I am.\u201d",

            "article_content": "This group is one of many right-leaning organizations pushing Congress to act on taxes After the defeat of health care, congressional Republicans are expected to move on to taxes A conservative group is launching a major $2.5 million ad buy Wednesday to ramp up public pressure on Republican members of Congress to address tax reform. American Action Network\u2019s Middle-Class Growth Initiative, a nonprofit funded by House Speaker Paul Ryan supporters, unveiled a new TV ad that will run on national cable throughout the August recess while lawmakers are at home, many of them holding events with constituents. It will air in 24 congressional districts represented by Republicans \u2013 including Ryan\u2019s district in Wisconsin \u2013 and will urge constituents to call their representative, whose name and number will be listed at the end of the commercial. It\u2019s part of a larger $5 million ad buy that the group announced shortly before August, and the group is one of many right-leaning organizations pushing Congress to act on the issue. The ad features a man who says he lost his job as a metal worker due to foreign competition. \u201cAmerica\u2019s tax code is so complicated \u2013 we can\u2019t be as competitive,\u201d he says. \u201cThousands of jobs like mine are lost to places like China.\u201d Following the failure of the Senate to pass health care legislation at the end of July, House and Senate leaders, along with the White House, announced they plan to seriously start looking at tax reform when Congress returns in early September. Ryan, at the time, said in a statement that the House intends to pursue \u201chistoric tax reform\u201d this fall, and the White House has laid out an aggressive timeline aiming to get a bill signed into law by mid-November. Trump talks to members of Congress on policy agenda during recess RELATED: Four big things that could stand in the way of tax reform The President laid out some of his tax reform proposals earlier this year, saying he wants to reduce the number of tax brackets from seven to three, double the standard deduction, and provide tax breaks to families who have childcare expenses. He also wants to significantly lower the corporate tax rate to 15%, far below the current top rate of 35%. Tax reform will be among several issues on the docket for Congress after the August recess. Raising the debt ceiling, passing the budget, and continuing the health care push are among the priorities, not to mention the ongoing congressional probes into the 2016 presidential election. The last time Congress passed comprehensive tax reform was in 1986.",

            "article_content": "Priorities USA invited CNN to observe focus groups of of Arizona voters Phoenix voters aren't sweating the economy as much as they are in Rust Belt states The voters who carried Donald Trump to victory in Arizona increasingly see the President as just another politician \u2013 and one who is running out of time to deliver on his campaign promises. Republicans in focus groups held here last week by the Democratic super PAC Priorities USA largely said they are giving Trump between six months and a year before they run out of patience. Some said they have already decided against voting for him again. \u201cI loved him because he was different, and I thought that he really was going to do a lot of change \u2013 good changes,\u201d one Republican woman said. \u201cI hated Obama, so I was ready for a change.\u201d Now, she said, she has much less confidence in Trump\u2019s ability to change Washington. \u201cWhether it\u2019s the tweets or just some of the things \u2013 like the thing he just said about the cops,\u201d she said, in a reference to Trump urging police officers not to be \u201ctoo nice\u201d when putting suspected criminals into \u201cthe back of a paddy wagon\u201d during a recent speech. \u201cSomebody needs to just rein him in,\u201d she said. \u201cBefore I felt like he could do it all, and now \u2013 if somebody could just control him a little bit.\u201d At 200-day mark, Trump nominations still lag Here in the desert \u2013 where the housing crisis took a deep and lasting toll on homes\u2019 values \u2013 voters aren\u2019t sweating the economy as much as they are in Rust Belt states. Most point to an influx of new and expanding businesses and say they are relatively optimistic about their own upward mobility. Even those who opposed Trump in 2016 see the stock market climbing. But his failure to deliver on his campaign promises \u2013 better health care at a cheaper price, in particular \u2013 have rankled his supporters. And Democratic criticisms of Trump\u2019s plans for tax reform, as well as his proposed budget cuts, also carry the potential to put Republicans in danger headed into 2018\u2019s midterm elections. Those were the clear lessons that emerged from focus groups of nearly 30 voters. The voters who participated were paid, but were not told which organization had convened the groups. At the end of one, several incorrectly suspected they had been brought together in order to provide insights that would help right Trump\u2019s political ship. Priorities USA invited CNN to observe the focus groups on the condition that the participants be described by their voting history and affiliation and the groups into which they fit rather than using their names. Each of the three focus group discussions \u2013 one of Republicans, one of millennials and one of Hispanic voters \u2013 lasted two hours. The Phoenix focus groups, as well as earlier groups in Orlando, Florida, and Cleveland, Ohio, reflected a drop in support for Trump among independents and moderate Republicans. The Republican group in Phoenix reflected a sense that Trump\u2019s allegiances aren\u2019t with the middle class. Nine in 10 said he sides with corporations over regular people. Everyone in this focus group said congressional Republicans side with corporations, as well, while eight of the 10 said Democrats side with corporations. Trump\u2019s pledges to overhaul US trade deals and stem the tide of outsourcing haven\u2019t come to fruition, the Republican voters said \u2013 pointing to Indianapolis air conditioning manufacturer Carrier laying off hundreds of employees, as planned, despite Trump having declared victory in getting the company to keep some jobs in the United States rather than moving them to Mexico. \u201cThere shouldn\u2019t be any outsourcing. I thought we were going to turn the faucet off,\u201d one Republican man said. Some of those Republicans, who condemned Obamacare, also criticized the GOP plan to repeal and replace it. And they didn\u2019t fault home-state Sen. John McCain for casting a deciding vote against that GOP effort. Some cited Trump\u2019s attacks on McCain\u2019s war hero status in 2015. RELATED: John McCain\u2019s maverick moment \u201cI think it also goes back to the bickering in politics, because Trump had some pretty harsh things to say about McCain,\u201d one Trump voter said. \u201cSo, you know, touch\u00e9.\u201d \u201cAmerica should not be voting at 2 in the morning. That\u2019s last call,\u201d another Republican man said. Most voters across all groups said they were concerned by some of the messages presented to describe the benefits and drawbacks of Trump\u2019s tax reform effort. The most potent: That corporations would pay lower tax rates than individuals. Jeff Flake's devastating indictment of his Republican Party, in 11 quotes The view of Trump is especially important in Arizona \u2013 a state where 2016 Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton made a late play, but Trump won easily. In 2018, Sen. Jeff Flake \u2013 a Republican who recently wrote a book condemning Trump\u2019s effect on the GOP \u2013 is up for re-election and could face a primary challenge from a Trump ally. That has positioned the state as a testing ground of Trump\u2019s support within the party and among independents, who can vote in the GOP primary. The focus groups also showed clearer signs of danger for Democrats. The party\u2019s leadership is rolling out its \u201cA Better Deal\u201d economic populist platform headed into the midterms. But voters in the focus groups \u2013 one of Hispanics, one of millennials and one of Republicans who had voted for Mitt Romney in 2012, McCain for re-election in 2016 and, in all but one case, Trump \u2013 drew few clear distinctions between congressional Republicans and Democrats. \u201cIt\u2019s just a game at this point. Republicans and Democrats \u2013 \u2018I\u2019m better,\u2019 \u2018you\u2019re better,\u2019\u201d one millennial man said. \u201cI think that they\u2019re out for themselves. They\u2019re politicians. They are playing a game with all of our livelihoods,\u201d another millennial man said. \u201cEverybody\u2019s selfish,\u201d said a millennial woman. Jefrey Pollock, the Democratic pollster who led two of the three groups, said Democrats \u201ccannot take for granted the midterms.\u201d \u201cThere was a lot of mush\u201d in voters\u2019 perceptions of the two parties, Pollock said. \u201cThere\u2019s plenty of, sort of, \u2018It\u2019s all crap.\u2019\u201d He said between the focus groups, the chaos of the last two weeks \u2013 with Trump\u2019s White House going through the entire Anthony Scaramucci era and with chief of staff Reince Priebus\u2019s departure \u2013 was evident in Republican voters\u2019 souring on Trump. \u201cToday, it is different,\u201d Pollock said. \u201cYou can only reset so many times before it all gets tuned out.\u201d The good news for Trump: His business background still gives some voters confidence in his economic capabilities. In the Hispanic focus group \u2013 where no one supported Trump \u2013 the eight participants were asked how much confidence they had in Trump on economic issues. Five said none. The three who said \u201ca little\u201d or \u201csome\u201d cited his business background. But the group broadly complained that Trump hasn\u2019t delved into any measure of specifics on policy as President. \u201cYou\u2019re just making general statements, so it\u2019s all smoke and mirrors,\u201d one Latino man said. Another Latino man also used the phrase \u201csmoke and mirrors,\u201d saying that \u201canything (Trump) says is just almost for shock value.\u201d \u201cI don\u2019t think he has good advisers,\u201d said a third Latino man. \u201cHe doesn\u2019t know how to hire \u2018em cause he keeps on firing \u2018em.\u201d",

            "article_content": "President Donald Trump announced a ban on transgender people serving in the military Democrats say they're ready to mobilize in response This week, Democrats unveiled an agenda for the midterms that carefully avoided any mention of the issues that had led to accusations they\u2019d been playing \u201cidentity politics\u201d in recent elections. Their message, party leaders said, would be all economics, all the time. But President Donald Trump is \u2013 and has always been \u2013 a culture warrior. And he made an aggressive move to elevate those issues to the political forefront Wednesday by announcing via Twitter that he is banning transgender Americans from serving in the military. It is reminiscent of George W. Bush political adviser Karl Rove\u2019s efforts to push a same-sex marriage ban in 2004. Gregory T. Angelo, the president of the Log Cabin Republicans, said Trump\u2019s move \u201csmacks of politics, pure and simple.\u201d Cooper: Ban is a broken campaign promise This time, though, top Democrats say they don\u2019t fear that a political debate over transgender rights will damage them in the Rust Belt. And some Democratic senators running for re-election in red states were sharply critical of Trump\u2019s move. \u201cDemocrats need to show \u2013 and can show \u2013 that they can simultaneously fight for a society that is both more fair and more prosperous \u2013 and drive home the fact that Trump is delivering neither,\u201d long-time Democratic strategist Ron Klain said in an email. Democrats seen as prospects for the party\u2019s presidential nomination in 2020 immediately lambasted Trump\u2019s move. New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand vowed to introduce legislation to overturn it. California Sen. Kamala Harris called it \u201cdiscriminatory, wrong, and un-American.\u201d Former Vice President Joe Biden tweeted that \u201cpatriotic American who is qualified to serve in our military should be able to serve.\u201d The Democrats Trump is really seeking to put in an uncomfortable position, though, are the 10 senators up for re-election in states he won \u2013 all of which have more white, Christian voters who polls show are more likely to oppose transgender rights. Some of those senators also attacked Trump\u2019s decision. \u201cIf a service member can do the job and is willing, they should be able to serve \u2013 and they should be able to be open about who they are,\u201d said North Dakota Sen. Heidi Heitkamp, among the Democrats facing the toughest re-election battles in 2018. \u201cDecisions about military force posture and readiness are matters of life and death that should be among the most seriously considered by a president, and motivated by the best military judgment of the armed forces \u2013 not by politics,\u201d Heitkamp said. Indiana Sen. Joe Donnelly cited Alabama Republican Sen. Richard Shelby\u2019s criticism of Trump\u2019s transgender military service ban. \u201cWhen the stakes are as high as the safety and security of the United States, we should always have an open door for the best, most talented patriots,\u201d Donnelly said in a statement. \u201cMilitary service should be about abilities, integrity, and performance, and I agree with my Republican colleague Sen. Shelby that everybody should be treated fairly and given a chance to serve.\u201d \u201cThe decision announced by the administration today will prevent highly qualified, patriotic Americans from serving in our military,\u201d said Pennsylvania Sen. Bob Casey. Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown sounded a similar note, saying: \u201cWe should not turn away anyone who is willing and able to serve this country and help keep American safe.\u201d Sen. Tammy Baldwin, D-Wisconsin, tweeted: \u201cA ban against any patriotic American who wants to serve our country is wrong.\u201d Liberal groups push for health care to dominate the midterms Democrats have at least two major recent data points that suggest the political tide has shifted on LGBT issues. In Wisconsin \u2013 one of the states Trump won that is holding a Senate contest in 2018 \u2013 Baldwin, who became the first openly gay senator when she won the seat in 2012, is running for re-election. And in North Carolina, the economic backlash against Republicans\u2019 transgender bathroom bill played a central role in GOP Gov. Pat McCrory\u2019s loss in his re-election bid in 2016. Trump himself had campaigned on a promise to protect LGBT Americans \u2013 although it was always through the lens of defending them from \u201cradical Islam,\u201d rather than civil rights. \u201cThis will become the latest example for voters that the GOP agenda is about keeping their most extreme base happy to protect Trump, not about delivering on the things people care about so we protect the middle class,\u201d said Democratic strategist Jesse Ferguson. \u201cIf they think voters will reward them for an agenda that discriminates against people by firing thousands of them who want to protect our country instead of getting results on health care and the economy, they\u2019re tragically misreading America,\u201d he said. In a sign that the politics of the issue might not be in Trump\u2019s favor, Republicans in purple states, including Arizona Sen. John McCain, criticized his broad tweets that left unanswered questions about whether thousands of transgender people currently serving in the military will be kicked out. Missouri Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill tweeted a link to McCain\u2019s statement and added, \u201cWhat he said.\u201d West Virginia Sen. Joe Manchin also cited McCain. \u201cI agree with Sen. McCain that \u2018any American who wants to serve our country and is able to meet the standards should have the opportunity to do so \u2013 and should be treated as the patriots they are,\u2019\u201d he said in a statement. What he said \u2b07\ufe0f\u27a1\ufe0fSTATEMENT BY SASC CHAIRMAN JOHN McCAIN ON TRANSGENDER AMERICANS IN THE MILITARY  https://t.co/THzJblgnJ5 Other Republicans in swing states who are on the ballot in 2020 also criticized Trump\u2019s decision. North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis said he agrees with McCain. \u201cAmericans who are qualified and can meet the standards to serve in the military should be afforded that opportunity,\u201d said Iowa Republican Sen. Joni Ernst, a veteran. Sen. Cory Gardner, R-Colorado, told reporters, \u201cI think anybody who wants to serve in the military should serve in the military.\u201d",

So in pursuit of \u201cunderstanding Trump,\u201d CNN read the first chapter available online. Here are 10 top takeaways: I was honored to write the foreword to @NewtGingrich new book, #UnderstandingTrump, which was released today! \ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8\ud83c\uddfa\ud83c\uddf8 pic.twitter.com/XqajiaAQIX Eric Trump lauds Understanding Trump as an \u201cinside look into possibly the greatest campaign of all time,\u201d citing how his father \u201cgained the most primary votes of any GOP candidate in the history of the nation.\u201d Eric Trump also took time in his foreword to offer praise for his father, President Donald Trump, slipping in a classic \u201cMake America Great Again\u201d tag line: \u201cAs to my father, there is no greater man. He is compassionate and caring. He is brilliant and strong. More than anything, he deeply loves our great country. He ran on one promise, to Make America Great Again and he is already well on his way!\u201d \u201cTrump is the same way one-on-one. Your conversation with him may be brief, but during that moment you have his undivided attention and interest. In this way, Trump reminds me of Bill Clinton \u2013 another president with a grounded middle-class background. When you are speaking with either of them, he is fully engaged in the conversation. At that moment, you are the only person who matters.\u201d \u201cIn a very Trump-the-businessman way, he said, \u2018So, what\u2019s the bottom line?\u2019 I thought for a minute and said he could be competitive for about $70 to $80 million. His response was priceless. After a moment of thought, he said, \u2018$70 to 80 million: that would be a yacht. This would be a lot more fun than a yacht!\u2019 That\u2019s when Callista and I learned that a Trump candidacy was likely \u2013 and a Trump presidency was possible.\u201d \u201cTrump\u2019s no-nonsense approach makes a lot of sense to everyone outside Washington. Trump wants to set aside the abstract establishment theories and get to what makes up the real world. In a way, I would argue that Trump\u2019s way of thinking is a reversion to Tocqueville, Lincoln and Washington. If you look at the original American system, it was extraordinarily fact-based.\u201d \u201cTrump also made it a habit to learn to perform every job in his hotel business. There is even a great video available online of Trump doing all the different jobs in one of his hotels, from cleaning rooms to delivering room service to walking the dog of a guest.\u201d \u201cDonald Trump can learn very quickly, but he will resist being taught anything. So, if you walk in and say, \u2018OK, I have a 30-minute briefing with 16 PowerPoints,\u2019 the meeting will immediately end. Instead, if you want President Trump to know something, you have a casual chat.\u201d RELATED: CNN files lawsuit seeking Comey\u2019s Trump memos \u201cAny time a meal was served when I flew with candidate Trump aboard his nicely outfitted 757, it was invariably McDonald\u2019s, Wendy\u2019s or similar fast food. Here was this billionaire with a big plane and a professional crew, and his personal taste leaned toward Main Street American fast food. Friends who saw him in Palm Beach at the fancy Sunday brunch at his golf course reported the same pattern. Trump would wander through the line and get a cheeseburger and fries. It was a very practical reminder that in his heart Trump was raised as a middle-class guy from Queens \u2013 not a Manhattan socialite.\u201d In the first chapter, Gingrich makes a point of claiming \u2013 twice \u2013 how Trump\u2019s ties are the \u201cbest-selling ties\u201d in America. \u201cIn 2011, I was preparing to run for president, so I made a trip to Trump Tower. Donald was generous with his time, happy to discuss the campaign, and gave me several Trump ties \u2013 which he pointed out were longer than standard ties and had become the best-selling ties in America. \u201d Later, Gingrich touts Trump\u2019s business savvy: \u201cIt is easy to forget that while Trump\u2019s real estate and golf projects target the very wealthy, his retail and media products are aimed squarely at the middle class. Trump neckties, for instance, were at one time the best-selling ties in America. \u2018The Art of the Deal\u2019 sold more than one million copies and, of course, \u2018The Apprentice\u2019 was the top-rated show on television for several years.\u201d \u201cEven today, months after Trump won the election and was sworn in as president, the news media still tries to cover him as if he were a normal politician, and his ideological opponents continue to be viciously dishonest. They are either clueless or lying. Ignore them.\u201d \u201cIn mid-October 2016 \u2013 just three weeks before election day \u2013 all the polls were bad. The decade-old \u2018Access Hollywood\u2019 tape with Trump using vulgar language had been exploited to the fullest by the elite media, and virtually everyone in the Trump campaign was jittery and frightened. I called Trump to discuss effective counterpunches, and he told me, \u2018Just remember, I win. I always win. I am not quite sure how, but by Election Day, we will be winning.\u2019 It was a vivid reminder that this man had fought for every inch of his success in life, and he succeeded through seemingly impossible situations before.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Democrats were distraught in the wake of the 2016 election. Hillary Clinton\u2019s defeat was stunning enough. But the fact that she lost to Donald Trump led Democrats to question whether they had fundamentally misread the American public, and whether their party and its message needed a total overhaul. Then Trump actually became president. Suddenly Democrats\u2019 gloom lifted \u2013 even as Trump\u2019s poll numbers sagged. And candidates willing to take Trump on began to emerge \u2013 more like pour \u2013 out of the woodwork. As Karen Tumulty writes in a piece in the Washington Post today: \u201cPresidential buzz seems to be building around an unusually large and varied group of Democrats and famous names from outside of politics \u2013 a parlor game that includes pretty much every current Democratic senator and governor, mayors and House members, barons of the business world and, of course, the occasional wild-card celebrity. The Hill newspaper recently tallied 43 people who might run against Donald Trump.\u201d 43 people! Now, simply because lots and lots of candidates are considering the race doesn\u2019t mean Democrats have solved all of the problems the 2016 campaign exposed. Democrats still have to litigate out whether it\u2019s Joe Biden\u2019s party or Elizabeth Warren\u2019s party going forward. And there are lots and lots voices who want to have a say in that debate. But what Trump\u2019s performance in office has done is give Democrats\u2019 hope. And, in the immortal words of Andy Dufresne: \u201cHope is a good thing, maybe the best of things, and no good thing ever dies.\u201d Here\u2019s my updated look at where the 2020 field stands today. The candidates are listed alphabetically within their respective tiers. For the purposes of this piece, I am taking people at their word if they say they aren\u2019t running. So, you won\u2019t find Mark Zuckerberg or John Hickenlooper or Kirsten Gillibrand or Sheryl Sandberg on this list. Don\u2019t see your favorite candidate? Never fear! There\u2019s still (lots of) time! 1st Tier (If they run, they have a real chance to win the nomination) Joe Biden Uncle Joe put any chatter that he\u2019s not thinking about running in 2020 to rest over the last few weeks. Opening a PAC to sprinkle money around to candidates \u2013 and fund his own travel to key states \u2013 is the leading edge of an effort to ensure Biden is at the front of the line, and has the right of first refusal. He\u2019s got that for now. Bernie Sanders \u201cHe hasn\u2019t made up his mind,\u201d former Sanders campaign manager Jeff Weaver told Tumulty of the Vermont independent. \u201cHe\u2019s open to it.\u201d Got it. Elizabeth Warren Warren, more so \u2013 to my mind \u2013 than Sanders, is the face of liberals nationally. I don\u2019t think that means Sanders would stand down for Warren, but it\u2019s hard to see how the top tier could fit both of them. 2nd Tier (Have potential to be a major contender but not there \u2026 yet) Cory Booker In the first kind of, sort of 2020 candidate cattle call last month at the Center for American Progress, the New Jersey Senator was given the closing, keynote spot. (You can watch his speech here.)  That elevated role speaks to his status as the brightest, youngest star in the current Democratic firmament. And Booker\u2019s latest response to the possibility of a 2020 bid leaves some wiggle room: \u201cI always say I\u2019m running from the president, not to the president right now. I don\u2019t know what the future holds, but at this time in my life, I want to be a fierce truth teller. Let\u2019s not focus on 2020; let\u2019s work on the injustices that exist now.\u201d Andrew Cuomo The New York governor is preparing to run for a third term next November \u2013 New York doesn\u2019t have gubernatorial term limits \u2013 but continues to entertain the possibility of a presidential bid in 2020. \u201cWe need to win back the middle class while pushing progressive values,\u201d said Cuomo, sounding entirely like a presidential wannabe during a visit to DC in February for a National Governors Association meeting. Al Franken Buzz around the possibility of a bid by the comedian-turned-senator is growing \u2013 particularly as he moves around the country promoting his new book. Franken\u2019s appeal? He is Trump\u2019s equal (at least) as a performer, but also has a solid policy core. Kamala Harris The newly-elected California Senator insists she isn\u2019t spending any time thinking about the possibility of a 2020 bid. But she did make time in her calendar to speak at the CAP cattle call last month. In her speech, she focused on criminal justice reform, noting: \u201cThere\u2019s a real opportunity to reach parts of America that feel overlooked and don\u2019t realize how much they have in common with people who look very different.\u201d Tim Kaine It remains to be seen whether Democrats in 2020 want to totally and completely move on from what happened in 2016. If they do, Kaine, who shared the ticket with Clinton, will have a hard time. If not, however, lots of the things that made him attractive as a VP \u2013 governor and senator of a swing state, bilingual, etc. \u2013 would also make him an appealing presidential candidate. Terry McAuliffe McAuliffe is bumping up hard against Virginia\u2019s one-term limit. He\u2019ll be out of office in early 2018 and is looking for something to do. And, unlike most of the people on this list, the Macker isn\u2019t pretending he doesn\u2019t want it. \u201cI\u2019d like to be Tom Brady\u2019s backup quarterback, I\u2019d like to be the Pope too in the future,\u201d he told ABC in late March. \u201cYou know my personality, go big or go home.\u201d Chris Murphy The Connecticut Senator won\u2019t have room to run if Sanders and/or Warren do. But, if they don\u2019t \u2013 and neither is a sure thing \u2013 he could well slot into the leading liberal role, given his outspokenness on gun control in the wake of Newtown and, more recently, his vocal opposition to the Trump presidency. 3rd Tier (It\u2019s not IM-possible) Steve Bullock Bullock was in Washington last month for the CAP cattle call. Which means he wants to be part of the great mentioned. The issue for Bullock? Money. How does he raise enough to compete with already-better-known people in tiers above him? Eric Garcetti The Los Angeles Mayor wants to run for something in the next few years. The governor\u2019s race is open in 2018 and there continue to be some whispers that Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D) isn\u2019t a sure thing to run for reelection next November either.  But it sure seems like Garcetti has his eye on a run for president. Not only did he speak at the CAP conference, but he also gave a very vague answer to Politico \u2013 \u201cI\u2019m not focused on running for president\u201d \u2013 when asked about 2020. Jay Inslee I\u2019ve moved the Washington governor down a tier from the last ranking I did because there continues to be no obvious movement \u2013 behind some allies in Washington pushing his name \u2013 that would suggest Inslee is actually interested in the race. I still think Inslee is an interesting profile, however, and he continues to go after Trump hard. Amy Klobuchar The Minnesota Senator has a Franken problem. Her home-state colleague is buzzier right now. Of course, it\u2019s a very long time until anyone votes, and Klobuchar is already aggressively stumping like a 2020er. Mitch Landrieu Landrieu\u2019s speech on the removal of several status of Confederate generals in his hometown of New Orleans was terrific \u2013 and rightly won him considerable national attention. But, it\u2019s still tough to run for  president as a sitting mayor of New Orleans. Seth Moulton Moulton is one of the young up-and-coming Democrats in the House. But, that\u2019s probably where he\u2019ll stay for now. Martin O\u2019Malley The former Maryland governor isn\u2019t giving up the dream of being president just yet. He\u2019s been back to New Hampshire, conducted a poll in Iowa and has been one of the most high-profile pols supporting Archie Parnell\u2019s long-shot bid in South Carolina\u2019s 5th district. Those are not the actions of someone who is done with all of this. Tier-less (Rich businesspeople who\u2019ve never run for anything before) Mark Cuban The Dallas Mavericks owner is playing it coy, sort of, when it comes to the possibility of running for president. \u201cNone. None,\u201d he told the Washington Post about his interest, before adding: \u201cBut at the same time, sometimes you got to do what you got to do.\u201d I mean\u2026 Howard Schultz The Starbucks founder is clearly interested in doing more in public life. In fact, he considered running for president in 2016 against Clinton. (I did not know that!) His interest in elected office coupled with a rags-to-riches life story and an estimated net worth in the billions makes Schultz intriguing.",

The \u201cSaturday Night Live\u201d alum has now written a total of seven books, dating back to his first book published in 1992 titled \u201cI\u2019m Good Enough, I\u2019m Smart Enough, and Doggone It, People Like Me! Affirmations by Stuart Smalley.\u201d His latest book is a memoir, following Franken\u2019s rise from comedian to elected official. What people are talking about: Franken has a whole chapter in the book \u2013 called \u201cSophistry\u201d \u2013 dedicated to his fellow Sen. Ted Cruz (and their ongoing beef). A line from the chapter reads: \u201cHere\u2019s the thing you have to understand about Ted Cruz: I like Ted Cruz more than most of my other colleagues like Ted Cruz. And I hate Ted Cruz.\u201d On \u201cAnderson Cooper 360\u201d on Tuesday, Franken said Cruz is like the \u201ctoxic guy in an office, the guy who microwaves fish.\u201d Cruz is not too pleased. In an interview with Politico, Cruz called Franken \u201cobnoxious and insulting\u201d for writing about him. An excerpt of the chapter circulated on Twitter ahead of the book\u2019s release. .@alfranken, in Giant of the Senate, recounts @amyklobuchar pre-clearing a Ted Cruz joke she was going to tell at Gridiron with @tedcruz pic.twitter.com/xj3ox3hFqT Franken has also been asked whether he\u2019s considering a 2020 run for the White House. He told Cooper while such talk is \u201cflattering,\u201d he\u2019s only planning on seeking a third term in Senate. Book title: \u201cWritten Out of History: The Forgotten Founders Who Fought Big Government\u201d Release Date: May 30 The back story: As the title suggests, Lee\u2019s book delves deeper into the \u201cforgotten founders,\u201d including Aaron Burr, Mercy Otis Warren and Canasatego. This is the Utah Republican\u2019s fourth book following the release of \u201cOur Lost Constitution: The Willful Subversion of America\u2019s Founding Document\u201d in 2015. What people are talking about: That \u201cHamilton\u201d connection. In the book (of which Politico published an excerpt), Lee touches on how creative storytellers, including Lin-Manuel Miranda (behind the hit Broadway show \u201cHamilton\u201d) have \u201cbreathed life into stories we thought we knew.\u201d However, \u201ceven with their newfound fashionability, the founders remain widely misunderstood.\u201d Lee points out that some like former Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton used Hamilton as a mascot, backing that with lyrics from the musical. But Lee writes Hamilton was \u201cone of the most fervent advocates of a robust national government.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s understandable why progressives would imagine Hamilton as their partisan, Big Government comrade,\u201d Lee writes. \u201cBut this understanding of Hamilton is based on a deeply distorted image of him. Call it the \u2018Hamilton Effect\u2019: Twisting history to suit one\u2019s ends, willfully ignoring and ultimately erasing it when it stands in your way.\u201d Book title: \u201cThe Vanishing American Adult: Our Coming-of-Age Crisis \u2013 and How to Rebuild a Culture of Self-Reliance\u201d Release Date: May 16 The back story: Unlike most other books by politicians, Sasse\u2019s focus is not on himself, nor is it about politics. Instead, the Nebraska Republican gives readers advice on how to raise children well. As The Daily Beast put it: \u201cThere\u2019s no glossy photo of him on the cover staring meaningfully into the future, and no easy bromides inside.\u201d What people are talking about: In its first week, Sasse\u2019s book has ranked No. 4 on The New York Times\u2019 bestseller list. According to Nielsen Bookscan data, the senator\u2019s book is pretty popular, selling about 14,000 copies in its first few days. More recently, the lawmaker made headlines after live tweeting his daughter\u2019s piano recital using the buzzword of the week: \u201ccovfefe.\u201d \u201cIt\u2019s #PianoRecital night. Livetweeting likely, despite the constant negative press covfefe,\u201d the frequent critic of President Donald Trump tweeted, poking fun at the President\u2019s now-deleted tweet that caused a stir Wednesday after it was posted. Book title: \u201cThis Fight Is Our Fight: The Battle to Save America\u2019s Middle Class\u201d Release Date: April 18 The back story: Warren\u2019s 12th book, which made The New York Times\u2019 bestseller list, analyzes why the middle class in America is \u201cunder siege and how we can win the fight to save it.\u201d What people are talking about: There is heavy speculation that Warren has plans to run for president in 2020. However, in an interview with Chelsea Handler, she said she\u2019s focused on her role in Senate. \u201cI\u2019m not running for president, I am running for the Senate in 2018,\u201d she said. Book title: \u201cCaptured: The Corporate Infiltration of American Democracy\u201d Release Date: February 21 The back story: This is the Rhode Island Democrat\u2019s second book. It digs into the influence corporate money has on American Politics. (Fun fact: It\u2019s apparently one of the books on Franken\u2019s night stand). What people are talking about: The book came out early in 2017, but now chatter around Whitehouse involves Russia. The lawmaker is the ranking member of a Senate judiciary subcommittee investigating Russia\u2019s role in the 2016 election.",

            "article_content": "China has gone from climate \"bad boy\" to \"de facto leader\" US has left leadership vacuum that China's expected to fill It\u2019s been a good year for Chinese President Xi Jinping on the international stage. He presided over a summit on his grand plan for the world economy, charmed the global elite at Davos and saw off the TPP, a huge trade deal that Beijing wasn\u2019t part of. On Thursday, US President Donald Trump handed China the keys and an extra tank of gas \u2013 quitting the Paris climate accord and shifting leadership of global efforts to limit climate change to Asia. \u201cIf you\u2019re Xi Jinping, you probably could not have written a better script for how this year could go with Trump essentially retreating across the board on these issues,\u201d says Christopher Balding, a professor of economics at Peking University. \u201cWhen there\u2019s a vacuum, China will step forward and take that.\u201d Even before Trump went public with his decision to ditch the agreement, China, the world\u2019s second largest economy, made clear it would stick with the Paris accord while Premier Li Keqiang met with European leaders, including German Chancellor Angela Merkel, this week. \u201cWith tremendous efforts, China will move towards the 2030 goal step-by-step steadfastly,\u201d Li said Thursday. China reaffirmed its commitment to fighting climate change, saying it was a \u201cresponsibility shouldered by China as a responsible major country.\u201d \u201cWe think the Paris accord reflects the widest agreement of the international community with regards to climate change, and parties should cherish this hard-won outcome,\u201d said foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying, Friday. China\u2019s hasn\u2019t always been a leading voice in the fight against climate change. In 2009, at the Copenhagen climate talks, the country was accused of dragging its feet. Li Shuo, a climate analyst at Greenpeace in Beijing, said China was once considered a \u201cclimate bad boy.\u201d Three things have changed since then, says Balding. First, reducing pollution has become an important issue domestically \u2013 especially among the growing middle class. Second, China scented economic opportunity in clean energy and pumped money into the sector. Third, says Balding: \u201cScientists in China were very diligent and they said look, climate change isn\u2019t just some Western conspiracy to keep China down. There\u2019s valid evidence.\u201d China has made strides in cutting emissions and promoting investment in renewable energy but the switch away from coal has been slow \u2013 it still accounts for 66% of its energy mix. The country\u2019s National Energy Administration said in January that China will spend more than $360 billion through 2020 on renewable technologies such as solar and wind. China invested more than $88 billion in clean energy in 2016, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance, down from an all time high of almost $120 billion in 2015, but still significantly more than the $58.8 billion invested by the US last year. \u201cI\u2019m hesitant to call it a true leader on climate change but it is a de facto leader. This has fallen into its lap,\u201d Balding said. The moral victory that the US has ceded to China gives Xi a boost at home as well as on the global stage. China will have its once-every-five years Communist Party National Congress later this year when a new generation of leaders will be revealed \u2013 akin to an election year in the US, says Balding. \u201cBeing able to say that China is more important globally than it was five years ago, that builds morale going into the Fall,\u201d he says. The reputational and geopolitical blow that Trump has dealt to the United States was clearly on view this week in Europe, says Li from Greenpeace.   Trump was given a frosty reception by Merkel and other European leaders at the G7 and NATO, while the body language between Merkel and China\u2019s Premier appeared much more comfortable. Li is considered likely to capitalize on major policy fissures that have emerged between Europe and the Trump administration on climate, trade and defense. But for all their new found passion, China and Europe make uneasy bedfellows. There are major questions about the compatibility of their economic systems plus flashpoints over democracy and human rights. \u201cI think Europe is frustrated with Trump and they want to do business with China and have it on board with climate change but there are big differences in values,\u201d says a Beijing professor, who didn\u2019t want to be identified speaking on what he described as a sensitive topic. The professor says Trump\u2019s turn inward tarnishes the democratic model the US has sought to project elsewhere \u2013 at least from outside the Western world. \u201cDemocracy, at least how its practiced, seems to be underperforming in many areas right now and it\u2019s facing harsh criticism. The reputation of China and the China model rises because of this.\u201d CNN\u2019s  Serenitie Wang, Nanlin Fang and James Griffiths contributed to this report",

            "article_content": "Friday's speech comes as Clinton has appeared increasingly willing to speak in public after her defeat in November In a CNN interview, Clinton referred to herself as \"a private citizen and part of the resistance\" Back on campus 48 years later, Hillary Clinton didn\u2019t hold back. In a  fiery commencement speech at her alma mater of Wellesley College on Friday, Clinton went after President Donald Trump and the controversies that are swirling around him, comparing his imperiled presidency to that of Richard Nixon\u2019s. \u201cWe were furious about the past presidential election of a man whose presidency would eventually end in disgrace with his impeachment for obstruction of justice, after firing the person running the investigation into him at the Department of Justice,\u201d Clinton said, discussing the sentiment on campus the year that she graduated. The former presidential nominee\u2019s sharp remarks \u2013 met with thunderous applause and cheers from the graduating class \u2013 was yet another sign of Clinton\u2019s increasing eagerness to publicly take on the man who handed her a second failed presidential bid. Clinton\u2019s comments also appeared to suggest she might even be relishing the deepening crisis at the Trump White House as it confronts a barrage of accusations of colluding with the Russians. Clinton\u2019s reference to Nixon\u2019s firing of an investigator was a clear knock at Trump\u2019s controversial decision to sack his former FBI Director James Comey. Since Comey\u2019s ouster, the President has been accused of urging Comey to end a probe into his ex-national security adviser, Michael Flynn. Clinton went on to take other thinly veiled digs at Trump, saying that \u201cwhen people in power invent their own facts and attack those who question them, it can mark the beginning of the end of a free society.\u201d \u201cYou are graduating at a time when there is a full-fledged assault on truth and reason,\u201d she added. \u201cSome are even denying things we see with our own eyes. Like the size of crowds.\u201d The 2020 Democratic race is underway. Here are 5 takeaways Just how close Clinton came to the presidency was a running theme throughout Friday\u2019s ceremony. Wellesley College president Paula Johnson noted in her introduction of Clinton that the famous alum almost broke the \u201chighest, hardest glass ceiling.\u201d \u201cAnd she won the popular vote,\u201d Johnson added for good measure. The student speaker, Tala Nashawati \u2013 a Middle Eastern Studies major from Ohio and the daughter of two Syrian immigrants \u2013 quoted from Clinton\u2019s concession speech to Trump. \u201cIn the words of Secretary Clinton: Never doubt that you are valuable and powerful and deserving of every chance in the world to pursue your dreams,\u201d Nashawati said. \u201cTo add to her wise words, let me say: Never doubt that you are durable. You are valuable. You are and unique.\u201d Clinton herself joked that she got through the aftermath of the election with the help of friends, family and wine. \u201cLong walks in the woods. Organizing my closets,\u201d she said. \u201cChardonnay helped a little too.\u201d Clinton\u2019s commencement speech came more than six months after her defeat to Trump, and almost five decades after a young Hillary Rodham\u2019s speech at her own graduation thrust her into the national spotlight. RELATED - Clinton: \u2018If the election had been on October 27, I would be your president\u2019 Clinton, now 69, got her diploma from the women\u2019s liberal arts college outside of Boston in 1969. The fact that Clinton, who was class president, would speak before her peers on graduation day was remarkable on its own: Prior to that year, the college had never had a student commencement speaker. Former Clinton campaign manager on Comey (Full Interview) But it was her now-well known decision to improvise \u2013 and publicly take a US senator on from the stage \u2013 that gave Clinton her first real taste of national recognition, fame and controversy, perhaps a defining moment that helped set young Clinton on a path to politics. Massachusetts Republican Sen. Edward Brooke had just given his remarks, urging the young women who were about to receive their diplomas not to protest the Vietnam War (antiwar demonstrations and sentiments were widespread at the time, particularly among young people). Clinton, seemingly with little effort, delivered an impromptu response to Brooke, specifically latching on to Brooke\u2019s message that he had \u201cempathy\u201d for those who opposed the Vietnam War. \u201cPart of the problem with just empathy with professed goals is that empathy doesn\u2019t do us anything,\u201d Clinton said, according to a transcript available on the college\u2019s website. \u201cWe\u2019ve had lots of empathy; we\u2019ve had lots of sympathy, but we feel that for too long our leaders have viewed politics as the art of the possible. And the challenge now is to practice politics as the art of making what appears to be impossible possible.\u201d Those off-the-cuff comments, inserted into the middle of her prepared speech, made Clinton both a hero among some on campus and also drew her scorn. The remarks also no doubt put Clinton on the map: She was featured in LIFE Magazine\u2019s spread on the class of 1969 that summer. Just as she had in 1969, Clinton called Friday on the graduating class to be active in the political process \u2014 and to ignore the \u201ctrolls.\u201d \u201cGet to know your elected officials. If you disagree with them, ask questions. Challenge them. Better yet \u2013 run for office yourself, some day,\u201d she said. \u201cIn the years to come, there will be trolls galore, online and in person\u2026 They may even call you a nasty woman.\u201d Her criticism of Trump aside, Clinton finished her remarks on a note of optimism. \u201cI believe in you with all my heart,\u201d she said. \u201cI want you to believe in yourselves. So go forth, be great, but first, graduate.\u201d",

Elizabeth Warren is \u201ctroubled\u201d to hear that President Barack Obama will receive $400,000 to speak at a Wall Street health conference in September. \u201cI was troubled by that,\u201d the Massachusetts Democrat said Thursday on SiriusXM\u2019s \u201cAlter Family Politics.\u201d \u201cOne of the things I talk about in the book (\u201cThis Fight Is Our Fight: The Battle to Save America\u2019s Middle Class\u201d) is the influence of money. I describe it as a snake that slithers through Washington and that it shows up in so many different ways here in Washington.\u201d Warren, an icon of the left and influential Democratic leader in the Trump era, is the most prominent progressive to publicly question Obama\u2019s decision, particularly after Hillary Clinton alienated many liberals during the 2016 election over her coziness with Wall Street. Despite the influence of the wealthy in politics, however, Warren said she is confident that the numbers are in favor of the American people. \u201cThere\u2019s more of us than there is of them,\u201d Warren added. \u201cAnd we\u2019ve got to use our voices and our votes and fight back.\u201d In the opening weeks of Obama\u2019s administration, the former president called bank CEOs \u201cfat cats\u201d amid widespread criticism about the golden parachutes given to execs whose companies contributed to the Great Recession. But an Obama spokesperson dismissed the idea that the large speaking fee compromises the former president\u2019s convictions. \u201cAs we announced months ago, President Obama will deliver speeches from time to time,\u201d Eric Schultz, a senior adviser to Obama, said Wednesday in a statement. \u201cSome of those speeches will be paid, some will be unpaid, and regardless of venue or sponsor, President Obama will be true to his values, his vision, and his record.\u201d \u201cWith regard to this or any speech involving Wall Street sponsors, I\u2019d just point out that in 2008, Barack Obama raised more money from Wall Street than any candidate in history \u2013 and still went on to successfully pass and implement the toughest reforms on Wall Street since FDR,\u201d he added. Schultz added that Obama will continue to focus most of his post-presidency on writing a book, giving speeches and \u201ctraining and elevating a new generation of political leaders in America.\u201d CNN\u2019s Kevin Liptak contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Pompeo, a Kansas Republican, sits down before the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence Russia's hacking efforts are an issue of top concern on both sides of the aisle Rep. Mike Pompeo, Donald Trump\u2019s pick for CIA director, promised Thursday at his Senate confirmation hearing to deliver unvarnished facts to the President and pledged to shield the agency from political influence at a time when Trump has been critical of the intelligence community. Like other nominees this week, the Kansas Republican disagreed with the President-elect in tone and substance on several occastions. He vowed not to reinstate enhanced interrogation techniques \u2013 even if ordered to do so by Trump \u2013 and took a harder line on Russia than Trump has displayed. Pompeo opened the hearing with criticism of Moscow even as the President-elect has suggested that the intelligence community\u2019s findings of Russian meddling in last year\u2019s election were overblown. Pompeo told the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence that he embraced those findings as spelled out in a comprehensive report of the intelligence community on the Russian breaches compiled earlier this month. \u201cWith respect to this report in particular, it\u2019s pretty clear about what took place here, about Russian involvement in efforts to hack information and to have an impact on American democracy,\u201d he said in response to questioning. \u201cThis was an aggressive action taken by senior leadership inside of Russia.\u201d He added that Russia would view the debate it has sparked in the US as something that would be \u201cto their benefit.\u201d Clapper: Russia hacks a multi-faceted campaign In his opening remarks, Pompeo listed Russia as well as China as \u201csophisticated adversaries\u201d in the cyber realm, saying \u201chackers are all taking advantage of this new borderless environment\u201d and \u201cthe CIA must continue to be at the forefront of this issue.\u201d In other criticism of Russia, he said the country has \u201creasserted itself aggressively, invading and occupying Ukraine, threatening Europe, and doing nothing to aid in the destruction and defeat of ISIS.\u201d His words were more aggressive toward Moscow than Trump\u2019s have been, continuing a theme evident throughout the confirmation hearings this week in which the President-elect\u2019s nominees have seemed more wary of the traditional American foe than their would-be boss. Pompeo pledged that the the CIA would provide policymakers with \u201caccurate, timely, robust and clear-eyed analysis of Russian activities.\u201d Along with Russia, Pompeo said other global threats include Iran\u2019s growing influence in the Middle East, ISIS\u2019s grip over major urban areas and the conflict in Syria. \u201cThis is the most complicated threat environment the United States has seen in recent memory,\u201d he said. The hearing moved Thursday afternoon to a closed session. Along with the hot-button issue of Russian hacking, Pompeo confronted a number of other controversial topics, chief among them the issue of torture. When questioned Thursday, Pompeo said he would not restart the CIA\u2019s use of enhanced interrogation techniques if he is approved for the position. Democratic Sen. Dianne Feinstein asked, if ordered by President-elect Trump, whether he would restart the CIA\u2019s use of enhanced interrogation tactics the that fall outside of the Army Field Manual. \u201cAbsolutely not,\u201d Pompeo responded. \u201cMoreover, I can\u2019t imagine I would be asked that by the President-elect.\u201d Later in the hearing, Pompeo was asked by Sen. Martin Heinrich of New Mexico if he would commit that to complying with the law and acknowledge that the CIA is out of the enhanced interrogation business. \u201cYes, you have my full commitment,\u201d Pompeo said. The congressman has in the past appeared to agree with Trump on the topic, the latter of whom said he would \u201cabsolutely\u201d bring back waterboarding, as well as methods \u201ca hell of a lot worse than waterboarding.\u201d In response to the 2014 Senate report that found the CIA tortured suspected terrorists, Pompeo released a statement saying the methods used were constitutional. \u201cThese men and women are not torturers, they are patriots. The programs being used were within the law, within the Constitution, and conducted with the full knowledge of Sen. Feinstein,\u201d he said. \u201cIf any individual did operate outside of the program\u2019s legal framework, I would expect them to be prosecuted to the full extent of the law.\u201d Two of Trump\u2019s other nominees \u2013 Jeff Sessions for attorney general and John Kelley for the Department of Homeland Security \u2013 earlier in the week appeared to disagree with Trump on the issue. And retired Gen. David Petraeus, also a former CIA director, told CNN\u2019s Christiane Amanpour that he thinks Trump has given up the notion that torture will be reintroduced under his administration. Sen. Mark Warner, the top Democrat on the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, said in his opening statement that he\u2019s been \u201cconcerned\u201d by rhetoric from Trump. Warner continued that the CIA \u201cand the entire intelligence community has been repeatedly and unfairly subjected to criticisms of its integrity.\u201d \u201cThese comments have affected the morale of these dedicated men and women,\u201d he said. \u201cToday, I would like to hear your plan to reassure CIA employees that those countless hours they commit, and the operations where they may be called upon to put their life on the line, are not in vain, and that their sacrifices will not be disregarded in the White House, or anywhere else in the next administration.\u201d Warner\u2019s opening statement was interrupted by a power outage at the hearing that put the session into temporary recess. Trump agreed Wednesday for the first time with the intelligence community\u2019s assessment that Kremlin was behind the hacking. \u201cI think it was Russia,\u201d he said, after weeks of criticizing the intelligence community\u2019s findings, including a series of tweets this week accusing them of leaking allegations that tie Trump to Russia. \u201cIntelligence agencies should never have allowed this fake news to \u2018leak\u2019 into the public. One last shot at me. Are we living in Nazi Germany?\u201d he tweeted Wednesday. Intelligence agencies should never have allowed this fake news to \"leak\" into the public. One last shot at me.Are we living in Nazi Germany? Asked in his first news conference after his election if he trusts intelligence agencies, Trump said they are \u201cvital and very, very important\u201d but didn\u2019t explicitly say he had faith in their information. Instead, he pointed to his own nominees like Pompeo, and former Sen. Dan Coats for director of national intelligence, as forward-looking examples of how his administration will address the hacking scandal. \u201cWithin 90 days, they\u2019re going to be coming back to me with a major report on hacking,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI want them to cover this situation.\u201d Pompeo\u2019s hearing comes just two days after the same committee grilled the nation\u2019s top intelligence officials, including current CIA Director John Brennan, FBI Director James Comey, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper and National Security Agency Director Michael S. Rogers. The officials said that the highest levels of the Russian government ordered the hacking of the Democratic National Committee and other state-level organizations in an attempt to sow doubt about the country\u2019s electoral process and to discredit Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. Old domains of the Republican National Committee were also hacked, Comey said, but there was no evidence that the current RNC or the Trump campaign were successfully penetrated. As CIA director, Pompeo will be involved with evaluating Iran\u2019s compliance with its agreement to curb its nuclear program. While he opposed the deal in Congress, he vowed to continue to keep up the CIA\u2019s monitoring of the situation, whatever the information gleaned indicates. \u201cIranians are professionals at cheating,\u201d he said. On social issues, Democratic Sen. Kamala Harris of California brought up Pompeo\u2019s opposition to same-sex marriage and asked if he would promise not to discriminate against LGBT employees of the CIA. \u201cYou have my full commitment to that,\u201d he said. Harris also brought up comments by John Brennan, the current CIA director, who said analysts have found climate change to be a deeper cause of \u201crising instability\u201d in certain parts of the world. Pompeo said he stands by his past skepticism of climate change but promised to relay any intelligence gathered that\u2019s related to the \u201cchanges in climatic activity.\u201d Pompeo graduated first in his class from the US Military Academy at West Point and served in the US Army from 1986-1991. He was stationed in Germany for a time as a cavalry officer patrolling the Iron Curtain, according to his congressional bio. He then graduated from Harvard Law School, where he was an editor at the Harvard Law Review. Returning to Kansas, he began a career in business, heading up companies that manufactured and provided materials for aircraft and oilfields. In Congress, he has built a reputation as a conservative stalwart on national security issues. In particular, he was known as a hardliner on the Select Committee on Benghazi, a panel that he felt was not hard enough on Clinton for the actions of the State Department she then headed in responded to attacks that resulted in the death of four Americans. He co-authored a lengthy addendum to the committee\u2019s findings in which he blasted Clinton for \u201ca tragic failure of leadership\u201d and accused the Obama administration of trying to cover up the true nature of the Benghazi attack. When Trump publicly announced Pompeo as his choice, the congressman received some praise from Democrats, including Rep. Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House intelligence committee, who said Pompeo is \u201csomeone who is willing to listen and engage, both key qualities in a CIA director.\u201d CNN\u2019s Caroline Kenny contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Trump tweeted saying that North Korea won't test a long-range missile Analysts suggest Trump should engage with Kim Jong Un President-elect Donald Trump made a bold bet on North Korea, saying the secretive country won\u2019t test an intercontinental ballistic missile that could reach the United States. In his New Year address, North Korea\u2019s volatile leader Kim Jong Un said the country was close to doing just that. \u201cIt won\u2019t happen,\u201d Trump tweeted January 2. He went on to repeat his claim that China wasn\u2019t doing enough to help the US rein in North Korea and its autocratic leader: \u201cChina has been taking out massive amounts of money & wealth from the US in totally one-sided trade, but won\u2019t help with North Korea. Nice!\u201d Trump wrote. North Korea just stated that it is in the final stages of developing a nuclear weapon capable of reaching parts of the U.S. It won't happen! China has been taking out massive amounts of money & wealth from the U.S. in totally one-sided trade, but won't help with North Korea. Nice! But, if his tweets are any guide, analysts say that Trump has backed himself into a corner on North Korea. They say Trump needs to reach for a new playbook if he really wants to stop Kim from adding to his arsenal a rocket powerful enough to reach any part of the US. It boils down to these four options. Since winning the election, Trump has suggested at least twice that China \u2013 North Korea\u2019s economic benefactor and only real ally \u2013 isn\u2019t pulling its weight when it comes to reining in Kim Jong Un\u2019s regime. But analysts say Beijing has no magic wand and is both unwilling and increasingly unable to influence its unruly neighbor. How China feels about North Korea's nuclear ambitions Tong Zhao, an associate at Carnegie-Tsinghua Center for Global Policy in Beijing, says that engagement between top level North Korean and Chinese officials has been suspended for quite a while. \u201cChina is frustrated by its inability to push North Korea,\u201d said Zhao. Trump could try and force China to cooperate by undermining its interests elsewhere \u2013 launching a trade war or confronting Beijing over Taiwan or the South China Sea but it would be a high-stakes move, which Zhao says would trigger a \u201chuge negative response.\u201d \u201cFrom a US-China perspective, it would be a huge waste of (political) capital and energy going after them on North Korea when the US could approach North Korea directly,\u201d says John Delury,  associate professor of Chinese studies at Yonsei University in Seoul. When asked about Trump\u2019s tweet, China\u2019s Ministry of Foreign Affairs insisted Tuesday China played an important and positive role in resolving the issue. The provocative but state-run Global Times newspaper was more critical, saying Trump was \u201cjust pandering to irresponsible attitudes.\u201d Trump could push China to beef up and implement existing sanctions more harshly but there\u2019s no evidence that sanctions have any impact on North Korea\u2019s decision making, says Jeffrey Lewis,  director of the US-based East Asia Nonproliferation Program. \u201cIt allows the US and our allies to look busy while the North develops an ICBM,\u201d he said, referring to the acronym for intercontinental ballistic missile. Zhao says that tougher sanctions may risk more brinkmanship \u2013 Kim is a man who can\u2019t be bought off. \u201cI don\u2019t see how North Korea will soften its position. They see a nuclear deterrent as absolutely crucial to ensure the country\u2019s survival. Only once they have it, will they devote resources to the economy.\u201d It\u2019s still a matter of debate how big a risk North Korea poses militarily and whether it could really put a nuclear warhead on a missile. It conducted two nuclear tests in 2016, one in January, and another in September, it\u2019s most powerful ever. It\u2019s also tested a string of missiles, both land and sea launched. So far, North Korea hasn\u2019t developed a delivery system capable of reaching beyond Asia but the fact North Korea remains the only country on Earth to test a nuclear weapon in the 21st century means that any military effort to take out Kim\u2019s regime is unimaginably high risk. North Korea\u2019s closest neighbors are the most vulnerable targets to nuclear or conventional weapons, of which Pyongyang has an ample arsenal. South Korea would have to be prepared for potential devastation if Kim were to strike. \u201cIt\u2019s not a viable option. We are way past pre-emption,\u201d said Delury. There are few other aggressive actions available, he added. North Korea has no diplomats the US could expel. \u201cNorth Korea is hard to punish because it has so little to lose. This is why it\u2019s different to Iran \u2013 where there was an economy integrated with Europe, a middle class that we could use as leverage.\u201d On the campaign trail, Trump said he would be happy to host Kim for a visit, saying in June \u201cwhat the hell is wrong with speaking?\u201d The comment appeared off the cuff and hasn\u2019t been repeated but Zhao and Delury both said that engagement was the only option if Trump wanted to make any head way with North Korea. Trump says he would talk to North Korea's Kim Jong Un \u201cI do think it\u2019s the way forward. It was a fleeting moment of Trumpian brilliance. He has the right instincts,\u201d Delury said. A US president meeting with the leader of a rogue regime known for its massive human rights abuses would be a hard sell domestically, Delury stressed, but wild card Trump might be capable of pulling it off. \u201cYou could imagine Trump in Pyongyang in a way you couldn\u2019t imagine Hillary Clinton,\u201d he said. Zhao said that North Korea had refrained from making any provocations since October and appeared to be willing to engage with a Trump administration. Trump could potentially be the \u201cAmerican president who prevented North Korea from obtaining the ability to strike the US with a nuclear weapon,\u201d Zhao added. \u201cYou only get a big breakthrough when two leaders actually talk to each other.\u201d CNN\u2019s Steven Jiang, Serena Dong and Hilary Whiteman contributed to this report",

His next book, \u201cBig Guns,\u201d will be released in April. This piece is one in a series of columns for CNN Opinion on life after Congress. The opinions expressed here are solely those of the author. Steve Israel: Whatever happens to GOP efforts to trash Obamacare, their 2018 midterm election prospects are looking eerily like Democrats' in 2010 And as Senate and House Republicans keep discovering with false starts at repeal bills, they need to brace themselves for more, Israel writes It\u2019s not repeal and replace, it\u2019s rewind. No matter what the outcome of Republican efforts to trash Obamacare, every day of the 2018 midterm election is looking eerily for them like 2010 did for Democrats. Even now, I still have traumatic flashbacks to that electoral tsunami. At about this point in the 2010 midterm election cycle, Democrats had a confident grip on our majority. Sure, we sensed the headwinds against us. We recognized the strength of the Tea Party, signaling an early gathering of energy for our opponents. We even knew we\u2019d lose seats. Yet our 39-vote margin seemed strong enough to retain the gavel \u2013 maybe not a two-fisted hold, but just enough to keep it in our calloused fingers. Then there was the debate on Obamacare. We were caught somewhere on the political map between doom and dread. If we didn\u2019t pass the bill, our base would abandon us in the midterms, dampening voter turnout. If we passed it, swing voters in our most competitive districts would abandon us and vote for Republicans. Either would increase our losses. President Obama\u2019s approval was, at this point, comfortably over 50% and slid to the mid-40s by the midterms. President Trump\u2019s current approval is at 40% and even a strong and improbable rebound gets him no higher than Obama\u2019s worst numbers. I remember the faces of some of my colleagues as the vote on Obamacare neared. In caucus meetings, we listened to passionate (and now familiar) arguments about keeping our campaign promises and passing the bill. Democrats who had won historically Republican districts came to the floor as if en route to their political funerals. Some were enraged that their progressive colleagues didn\u2019t understand the backlash they were getting back home. Others came to the floor with glints of defiance and girded for battle in the upcoming elections, knowing that passing the bill was the right thing to do. Single payer is the fight Democrats have been waiting for On March 21, the House passed the Senate\u2019s Obamacare bill by a 219-212 vote in the House (the Senate\u2019s bill had passed on Christmas Eve with a filibuster-proof 60-39 majority). President Obama signed the bill into law two days later. In the ensuing midterms, we lost 63 seats and our majority in the House; we held our Senate majority despite losing six seats. A study by researchers at the University of Denver and North Carolina State University on the impact of the healthcare vote and other legislation singled out 13 seats we lost because of Obamacare, and found that it was the leading reason that House Democrats had been defeated. Recently, I spoke with former Rep. Baron Hill, an Indiana Democrat. I asked whether he sensed that he might lose his seat when he voted for Obamacare. \u201cWe are elected to lead,\u201d he told me. \u201cThe ACA was and is good for people in Indiana as well for the country. Republicans successfully demonized it for political reasons. But if we are really sincere about doing what\u2019s best for the people we represent, especially on an issue as big as ACA, politics needs to be shelved and leadership needs to prevail.\u201d I\u2019ve never believed that Obamacare alone was responsible for Baron Hill\u2019s defeat, or for the loss of 62 other seats to Republicans in 2010. But it was the tip of the spear. The economy was still reeling from the 2008 meltdown. The middle class felt betrayed and insecure. The Citizens United decision flooded competitive districts with dark money ads from K Street.  There is one difference between the 2010 races and 2018 (so far). Republicans have outflanked Democrats by taking control of redistricting and fortifying their incumbents. But by every other measure, Republicans looking at 2018 should see shades of 2010. The middle class still feels uncertain. The President is historically unpopular. Democrats have the momentum. And as Senate and House Republicans keep discovering with false starts at repeal bills, passing something that has the support of a measly 33% of Americans may be like tying a rodeo rope around their bucking base, but it\u2019s also likely to send many voters in search of another horse. Which means Republicans in Congress should brace themselves.",

He is a partner at RunSwitch Public Relations in Louisville, Kentucky. Follow him on Twitter @ScottJenningsKY. The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. Republicans are euphoric. After years of talking about tax reform on the campaign trail, a bill that cuts taxes, simplifies the code, and primes the American economy for more growth has passed the House and the Senate and is on its way to the White House for President Donald Trump\u2019s signature. This achievement was years in the making for House Speaker Paul Ryan, solidifying his place in history as a policy wonk with the political skills to see through something as complicated as changing the US tax code. He found enough common ground for what is often a fractured group of his party members to deliver a win on what is perhaps the last unifying issue for Republicans of all stripes: the idea that taxes should be lower. As for Mitch McConnell, he erased the Steve Bannon-fueled narrative that the majority Republican conference isn\u2019t delivering for President Trump. Thanks to McConnell, Trump can claim victory on taxes and health care, as this bill achieves what some are calling a \u201cstealth repeal\u201d of Obamacare through the elimination of the individual mandate. Given all the work McConnell has done on judges (12 circuits, one Supreme Court) and rolling back regulations, the Senate majority leader from Kentucky is playing Michelangelo to Trump\u2019s Pope Julius II. The Sistine Chapel took a while, but when it was done \u2014 wow! Trump repaid the favor on Twitter, announcing he could not have had \u201ca better or more talented partner\u201d than McConnell. Steve Bannon is somewhere shaking his fist at a cloud, no doubt. Paul Ryan addresses retirement rumors Some political observers point to public opposition to this tax plan as evidence that Republicans didn\u2019t \u201cwin\u201d anything at all. They are wrong. The Democrats lied more about this plan than the average person does on their online dating profile, locking arms and agreeing to spew falsehoods no matter how many were debunked. But public opinion is based largely on polling, and polls can be deceiving, something Democrats know well. They also know, as Ryan pointed out, that paychecks are going up come February when they see the difference in withholdings. Democrats have made fools of themselves with their unhinged talking points. Nancy Pelosi railed against the tax plan as  \u201cthe worst bill in the history of the United States Congress.\u201d Has she not heard of the Sedition Act of 1798, or the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850? She even called this tax bill \u201cArmageddon.\u201d  Former Clinton and Obama administration official Larry Summers took the derangement further, claiming that roughly 10,000 people will die each year because of this tax reform. Rep. John Yarmuth of Louisville tweeted that the bill is an \u201cinsult to our democracy.\u201d Wouldn\u2019t the real insult be for the party who won the last election to ignore its campaign promises? Watching the Democrats talk in cursive, warning of the End Times, should tell us what we need to know about their ability to credibly weaponize taxes for the midterms. I used to think Democrats would fall back on the same old tired class warfare bologna, but seeing their new rhetorical arsenal makes me almost pity them as they try to rekindle any sort of relationship with middle America.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Nic Robertson is CNN\u2019s international diplomatic editor. The opinions in this article belong to the author. At ground zero, by Jerusalem\u2019s Old City walls, reaction to President Trump\u2019s declaration that the United States now recognizes the city as being Israel\u2019s capital is both mixed and muted. A small group of Palestinian women sat chanting outside the ancient Damascus Gate and youths who in other cities might be described as feral baited police, in an almost ritualized ebb and flow of bravado. There was no violence and Israel Police spokesman Micky Rosenfeld told me the gathering was \u201crelatively small \u2026 we\u2019ve dealt with much larger.\u201d He would be there again Friday as Palestinians streamed home following their most important prayers of the week. It was the moment many had feared could turn to ugly violence. It didn\u2019t. The vast majority of people left peacefully. Perhaps a hundred teenagers stopped to chant in anger, later tangling with police as they were moved on. In the same place six months ago, the police coped with far bigger and much more violent crowds. If Rosenfeld was surprised at the low turnout, he didn\u2019t show it. He told me that the police were still evaluating what may come in the days ahead. Trump's Jerusalem move: Deadly clashes erupt after Friday prayers I was puzzling over other conversations I\u2019d just been having. Educated, articulate Palestinians describing to me both their frustration with their own leadership and their anger with Trump. Nearly 25 years after the first Oslo peace accords held out hope of a two-state solution, we have little to show for it, one middle-class 30-something man told me. He said that Palestinians need new leaders and a new approach. He singled out Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas as being particularly weak. A 45-year-old woman was angry with Trump. She told me she grew up in the Old City, that he didn\u2019t understand the impact of his decision and that he cared only about his popularity back home. What struck me most, however, was that while Trump is viewed back in the United States as a polarizing leader \u2013 praised by some, reviled by others \u2013 these Palestinians saw him as the true face of America. They say that Trump is finally revealing the true America that previous presidents had managed to hide. No matter how much I countered that Trump\u2019s election victory was a close-run thing and more than half the people who voted didn\u2019t pick him, they were unshakable in their view: Americans are fundamentally pro-Israeli, anti-Arab and anti-Muslim. Trump\u2019s rationale that moving the US Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem was merely a reflection of on-the-ground realities \u2013 most key Israeli government buildings being in Jerusalem \u2013 seemed to have found a mirror among the Palestinians I talked to. For them, Trump had merely confirmed their own views of what was happening in Jerusalem. The question is, does this make peace negotiations between Palestinians and Israelis harder or easier? Much will depend on what happens in coming days. Hamas has called for an intifada, and there have already been at least four rockets fired from Gaza into Israel. Israel returned fire at what the Israel Defense Forces describe as Hamas targets; two people were killed by the airstrikes, the Palestinian Health Ministry said. Protests in the West Bank and Gaza, unlike Jerusalem, were more heavily attended and did turn violent and deadly when two Palestinian men were fatally shot in Gaza. The IDF said it \u201cfired selectively towards dozens of main instigators and hits were confirmed.\u201d Seven people were arrested during the clashes on Salah el-Din Street in Jerusalem, Israel Police spokesman  Rosenfeld said, adding later via Twitter that four officers were slightly injured by stones and 13 protesters were arrested at the Damascus Gate area. The Palestinian Red Crescent said Saturday it had treated 231 people injured in the West Bank, Jerusalem and Gaza \u2013 including 12 wounded by gunshots, 24 hit by rubber bullets and 172 who inhaled tear gas. However, in contrast to protests and clashes in previous years, these have been of smaller and lower intensity. Around the world, many leaders criticized Trump, while some seasoned observers were left wondering why the zeal for a protracted escalation was apparently absent. Yet, however uncomfortable this may feel to the Palestinians, the decision over what to do next does seem to be in their court. Israel, as Rosenfeld told me, is ready whatever transpires: \u201cIf there\u2019ll be any local incidents, any small-scale incidents, we\u2019ll deal with them as well as large-scale incidents.\u201d Either by design or default, Trump has orchestrated a moment of realpolitik. It may also be a huge gamble. Even if Palestinian peace negotiators do blink at what so many of them consider to be a major provocation by a now-discredited partner in the peace process, others may not. Iran\u2019s proxy, Hezbollah, met with Hamas on Thursday, hinting it is ready to meddle more heavily than it has recently in Israeli-Palestinian politics. Finding common cause with Palestinians has always been a way for Iran to needle Israel. On this occasion, Hassan Nasrallah, Hezbollah\u2019s leader, appears to be calibrating his spike, calling for a social media campaign, diplomatic pressure and protests \u2013 not violence \u2013 to cause the Israelis and the United States pain. Everyone is treading carefully, not least Trump and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Both were at pains to say Trump\u2019s decision changes nothing on the ground. \u201cWe are not taking a position of any final status issues, including the specific boundaries of the Israeli sovereignty in Jerusalem,\u201d Trump said. \u201cI call on all parties to maintain the status quo at Jerusalem\u2019s holy sites,\u201d he said, importantly stating a two-state solution is still an option. Netanyahu, in a recorded message soon after, made his own commitment: \u201cThere will be no change whatsoever to the status quo at the holy sites. \u2026  Israel will always ensure freedom of worship for Jews, Christians and Muslims alike.\u201d Both men have credibility issues with the audiences they are trying to reach, but it doesn\u2019t change the realpolitik of the situation. That\u2019s their line and they\u2019ve agreed to it. Islam\u2019s third holiest site, the Al-Aqsa Mosque, is in Jerusalem. Had Trump specifically said all of Jerusalem was Israel\u2019s capital, many in the region feared it could have energized groups like ISIS and al Qaeda that Trump is striving to defeat. But perhaps Trump\u2019s bigger problem in bringing peace to the Middle East is the good will he is eating up with his allies. Many of them told him not to take this decision now and have very publicly rebuked him since. It\u2019s hard to find a single diplomat who thinks now was the time to press ahead. Jerusalem is the ultimate carrot in any peace negotiation. Its fate is the prize at the end of arduous negotiations. For Palestinians right now, it feels like a stick: the ultimate rod to ruin any illusion that this President cares about them, their aspirations or their place in the world. The greater the gap Trump opens between himself and longstanding US friends, the less leverage he\u2019ll have over his enemies. Why US State Department vacancies are a big deal Trump, it seems, does not have that in mind. He has become both a bull in a china shop and a matador at the same time: wantonly breaking diplomatic crockery while prodding and goading erstwhile allies and friends. That Trump has given what so many Israelis have desired for so long cannot and should not be overlooked. It is hugely important that one of the world\u2019s superpowers has their back. Yet it would be an unforgivable error if a safe homeland for Jews became less safe as a result. Whatever happens now, Trump cannot stand apart from his decision, its implications and impact. The warnings were there. So to that question, does his decision make peace more likely? It depends what other moves he has. Does he plan to turn political capital he has garnered with Israeli politicians into leverage over them? Might he turn the high praise he received \u2013 Netanyahu called him courageous \u2013 into a demand for concessions no American president has been able to eke out of an Israeli prime minister in the past? Reports are also circulating that Trump\u2019s Saudi allies \u2013 King Salman and his son, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman \u2013 have told Abbas he needs to dial back his expectations on a peace deal. But Abbas is getting weaker. His condemnation of Trump\u2019s announcement paled next to that of his senior deputies and looks positively pedestrian next to Hamas\u2019 call for an uprising. The problem for peace right now is that mainstream Palestinian leadership is led by the mood on the street. How protests go will set the political course. Trump has rolled the dice, and when the heat surrounding his throw subsides, the odds that such an unlikely outsider can make a difference will be known.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Former US Rep. Steve Israel, a Democrat from New York, is a political novelist and CNN contributor. His next book, \u201cBig Guns,\u201d will be released in April. This piece is one in a series of columns for CNN Opinion on life after Congress. The opinions expressed here are solely those of the author. Steve Israel: For Trump base, Mueller indictments a nothing-burger; for Trump opponents, it's an all-you-can-eat buffet Israel: With GOP in Russia probe muck, to win swing voters Dems should focus on voters' kitchen-table concerns If you\u2019re among the 33% (according to the latest Gallup Poll) who support Donald Trump and if you get all your news from Trump-friendly outlets, the indictments of Paul Manafort and Rick Gates are indeed the \u201cnothing-burger\u201d the pundits like to discuss (paraphrasing the President himself, a nothing-burger meal might conclude with him standing in the middle of Fifth Avenue and shooting somebody without losing voters). On the other hand, if you\u2019re a stalwart Trump opponent, this is a lavish all-you-can-eat buffet. My own thoughts on the indictments stem from my experience as chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee, where I was in charge of recruiting and supporting House candidates. I\u2019d often meet with them at their political headquarters or invite them to my own office in Washington and dispense my sage counsel. I gave them all my best tips and laid out the rules for a viable campaign, and in the back of my mind I would always think: Rule 1 is to avoid headlines with words like \u201cindictment,\u201d \u201cmoney laundering\u201d and \u201cconspiracy.\u201d I always tried to communicate as much to them. In the current polarized political environment, and following on the heels of the indictments and the guilty plea of George Papadapoulos, we\u2019ll see whether my advice remains sound. I do, however, have some basic cautions for both political parties going forward. First, we\u2019re just about a year from the midterm election, and the impact of the Manafort, Gates and other potential indictments remain to be seen. This much is clear: Congressional Republicans were already experiencing headwinds, and those headwinds just became strong and sustained. Is this Watergate or Iran-Contra? Still, in our polarized environment, what appears as \u201cblack and white\u201d isn\u2019t as impactful as what\u2019s gray. If you\u2019re one of the coveted swing voters in a low-turnout midterm election, the impact of the Mueller indictment may be indirect and delayed. Those voters already look at Washington as dysfunctional and dishonest. For them, it\u2019s \u201canother day, another indictment.\u201d Those voters don\u2019t wake up and go to bed with Mueller and Manafort on their minds. For them, it\u2019s about their economic mobility and the futures of their children. It\u2019s about their family members ravaged by opioid abuse, the veteran who needs better health care, and their national security. They want an administration and a government that will focus on their survival and progress, not on its own political survival and the progress of its legal defense. President Trump\u2019s propensity to defend himself or deflect to attacking Hillary Clinton or others is likely to weaken him (and other Republicans) with those voters.  Republican strategies to shift the discourse to Democrats may gratify their base, but will alienate independent voters who want the President focused on them. Democrats, meanwhile, can\u2019t make the mistake of chomping at the Trump bait and helping him obfuscate the issues. Nancy Pelosi, the shrewdest political strategist and tactician I\u2019ve ever met, often categorizes campaigns as \u201cThe 3 Ms: message, mobilization, and money (to message and mobilize).\u201d  Adding two more M\u2019s in Mueller and Manafort won\u2019t win swing voters.  Talking about middle class mobility \u2013 while the White House wallows in the muck of a toxic investigation \u2013 will.  Of course, at the end of the day \u2013 and at the end of this election \u2013 we must ensure that our institutions and the rule of law prevail. But Washington sees everything through a political prism. This may look like a disjointed kaleidoscope right now. Clarity will emerge before long, and whichever party focuses on the issues being discussed by swing voters at their kitchen tables will win the majority next year.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Jonathan Tasini (@jonathantasini) is the author of \u201cThe Essential Bernie Sanders and His Vision for America,\u201d president of the Economic Future Group and the host of the \u201cWorking Life\u201d podcast. His book \u201cResist and Rebel: The Peoples\u2019 Uprising in America\u201d will be published in the fall. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. Jonathan Tasini: On Labor Day, it's important to talk truthfully about the decline in union power The narrative that support for unions is dying is just plain wrong, Tasini writes Picture this (imaginary) 2020 scenario: President Donald Trump, running for re-election, forces voters to attend his rallies, prevents his Democratic opponent from campaigning during the daylight hours and, in the event the Democrat wins the general election, delays for months and years his opponent\u2019s taking office. Even the most vociferous Trump critic could not imagine this happening in America \u2013 but these are the kinds of conditions workers face every time they try to win by forming a union. And often, it\u2019s even worse. On Labor Day, each year, there is the usual accurate observation that the decline in union strength is the principal reason workers\u2019 wages have not kept pace with productivity over the past three decades; union representation in the private sector has fallen well below 7% \u2013 compared to 35% in the 1950s. But, that decline in union power, and its result \u2013 the undermining of the American Dream of a middle-class livelihood \u2013 is rarely attributed to its real cause. That cause? The direct assault being waged by the union-busting industry, and the failure of the Labor Department and the National Labor Relations Board to stop repeat violations of the law. Many on the right too often attribute this decline wrongly to a lessening in the support for unions overall. The truth is that many people want to be in a union, and, by most public opinion measurements, that desire has not waned, and has even strengthened in recent years, according to some scholars. Richard Freeman, co-director of the Labor and Worklife Program at Harvard Law School, points out, \u201cIn 2002 the proportion of workers who said they would vote for a union rose above the proportion that said they would vote against a union for the first time in any national survey: a majority of nonunion workers now desire union representation in their workplace.\u201d The narrative that support for unions is dying is just plain wrong. Instead, rarely making the headlines or exposed by the traditional media is a hidden, ugly war against unions, orchestrated by a sophisticated, multibillion-dollar industry. These union-busters are no longer the Pinkerton-style company goons who shot down strikers with impunity in the early 20th century. These days, they wear three-piece suits, work as lawyers or consultants for national law firms, and specialize in convincing you that no one wants to be in a union in the first place. Their stock-in-trade is spreading fear and intimidation. With the first murmurs of an attempt to unionize, they unload a barrage of videos, websites, posters, buttons, T-shirts and PowerPoint presentations for employers to deploy against their workers\u2019 unionizing efforts. Some of them allegedly train supervisors how to intimidate workers. Some of them break the law if they need to, for example by illegally threatening to fire workers. Since penalties imposed by the National Labor Relations Board are small, large companies can view fines as just a cost of doing business. The truth about Trump's tax cuts During the recent organizing effort at Nissan in Canton, Mississippi, for instance, supervisors inundated employees with anti-union messages in mandatory one-on-one meetings. Nissan broadcast anti-union videos inside the plant telling workers to \u201cVote No.\u201d The union, as is the case in virtually every union election, had no such access to workers inside the plant. Indeed, six days before ballots were cast in the two-day election, the NLRB charged Nissan, not for the first time, for breaking the law by threatening workers with cuts in wages and benefits and holding out the possibility the plant would close if workers voted for the union. With this kind of fear coursing through the plant, workers voted 2-1 against the union. Full disclosure: I am a member of the United Auto Workers (UAW), the union attempting to organize workers in Canton. Even in situations where workers do vote in favor of a union, the battle does not end. It\u2019s common for management to stall or use tactics of endless delay to avoid actually agreeing to terms with the new union. Delay is the friend of the union buster: after voting for a union, workers want to see immediate results from standing up against the company \u2013 the entity that issues a paycheck. If companies and their union-busting lawyers can drag out the process, the company can, then, petition for a new vote one year later \u2013 and worn-down workers are frequently too exhausted to put up with another battle. In this vicious war in the workplace, Donald Trump\u2019s administration wants to make the union buster\u2019s work even easier. During the Obama administration, then-Secretary of Labor Tom Perez (who is now the chair of the Democratic National Committee), led an effort to close a loophole in the so-called \u201cPersuader Rule,\u201d which mandates full disclosure of all activities undertaken by these union-busting consultants. Casting sunlight on the consultants operating behind the scenes is one tool unions can deploy: When workers learn who their company\u2019s hiring to threaten and intimidate them, it can help build support for the union.  But the current secretary of labor, Alexander Acosta, is moving to rescind the persuader rule and allow \u201cindirect advice\u201d to go unreported. That will allow much of the union buster\u2019s activity to recede back into the shadows. If the activities of the union-busting industry received just 1% of the media coverage devoted to Russia\u2019s involvement in the 2016 election, we might have a far different country \u2013 where at least a modicum of democracy is present at work, where most of us spend half of our waking lives.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Mark Preston is CNN\u2019s executive director of political programming and senior political analyst. He hosts \u201cFull Stop with Mark Preston\u201d on SiriusXM POTUS 124. His full interview with DNC Chairman Tom Perez can be heard on Saturday at 12 p.m. ET, Sunday at 1 a.m. ET, and Sunday at 5 p.m. ET. Follow him at @prestonCNN. Mark Preston: Even with Trump's historically low approval ratings, Tom Perez still has a lot of work to do to restore faith in the Democratic Party The limelight on the administration is taking away from the attention that the Democrats need to gather support for their agenda Defeated, yet defiant, Democratic activists and demonstrators flooded streets across the country and around the world in late January to protest Donald Trump, who just 24 hours earlier was sworn-in as the 45th President of the United States. In Washington, it was a startling sight to see: where Trump supporters had watched his inauguration one day before, now political opponents stood in their place. The official name of the protest was the Women\u2019s March, but it became something bigger, much bigger, and expanded to include many traditional Democratic Party constituencies including environmental groups and unions. For Democratic operatives and organizers, January 21, 2017, was akin to Christmas and your birthday falling on the same day: the party\u2019s political base was frustrated, but not depressed. Political organizers could skip months of therapy sessions designed to excite Democrats and move straight onto crafting plans for the November 2017 elections and the 2018 midterm elections. Donald Trump had unified the Democratic Party. Or had he? Cupp: Wow, does Trump have an awful opinion of his own voters A month after the Women\u2019s March, Tom Perez was elected chairman of the Democratic National Committee \u2013 a high profile position tasked with the boiler room responsibilities of raising money, motivating voters and building infrastructure from the ground up. Hardly a plum assignment for the former Barack Obama Cabinet secretary following the surprising loss of the White House. To make matters more complicated, Perez took over a fractured party still reeling from the controversial Democratic presidential primary. Perez, a former Secretary of Labor and Justice Department official, is now charged with trying to unite the party\u2019s liberal and establishment factions, while restoring credibility to the national party organization, whose email system was hacked by Russia in 2016. Perez said he sees an opportunity in this age of Trump for Democrats to rally around the party\u2019s \u201cvalues\u201d on issues ranging from health care and income inequality to public education. \u201cWe all succeed when we all succeed, and we are all better when we are united,\u201d Perez said in a recent interview on SiriusXM\u2019s \u201cFull Stop with Mark Preston.\u201d Except it will not be that easy. Many liberals are still smarting over the 2016 presidential primary \u2013 a system they argued was rigged against Sen. Bernie Sanders, I-Vermont, in favor of the establishment favorite, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton. The word that once existed in Washington: compromise More than a year after Clinton won the presidential primary and seven months into Trump\u2019s presidency, the phrase \u201ctime heals all wounds\u201d does not seem to apply to all Democrats, certainly not at last week\u2019s Netroots Nation conference. The annual gathering of liberal activists was part strategy session, part political rally and speakers such as Sen. Elizabeth Warren, D-Massachusetts, urged attendees to demand that party leaders embrace and advocate for liberal policies. \u201cWe don\u2019t have to tiptoe anymore,\u201d Warren said.  \u201cWe don\u2019t have to hedge our bets.\u201d Nina Turner, president of Our Revolution \u2013 the organization founded by former Sanders campaign staff and supporters \u2013 wasn\u2019t tiptoeing when she accused the DNC of disrespecting the progressive movement. She recounted a standoff outside the DNC headquarters in late July when she was refused access to the building. Turner, a DNC member, and the activists she led were attempting to deliver petitions to party leaders. The group was not allowed to enter the building because of security concerns, which infuriated Turner. \u201cUnity requires give and take,\u201d said Turner, who was named president of Our Revolution in June. \u201cBut it seems that it\u2019s just take, take, take from the Berniecrats.\u201d DNC chair: I'm elated for Obama to return So, even though Trump is being roundly criticized for his Charlottesville remarks, has a 38% approval rating and is losing support from Republicans, Democrats must contend with their own internal problems. Perez said one of the first strategic acts he put in motion was a program called Resistance Summer. \u201cResistance Summer is a down payment on what the new DNC is about,\u201d said Perez, who sat for this interview prior to the Netroots Nation conference. \u201cIt was an investment that we made, and it\u2019s in place in over 40 states, and we are paying organizers out there so that we can talk to people again. One of the things we have to do, our new mantra at the DNC, is that every zip code counts.\u201d This all-inclusive approach is similar to the 50-state strategy implemented by former DNC Chair Howard Dean in 2005 and a concept advocated by Sanders in the 2016 campaign. Perez notes that Resistance Summer has paid off by helping New Hampshire Democrats pick up a state House seat and electing two Democrats to state legislative seats in traditionally ruby red Oklahoma. Mitch McConnell should have seen this coming \u201cSo that\u2019s the new DNC,\u201d Perez said. \u201cAnd one more observation, which is 2017 for me is feeling a lot like 2005. In 2005, we had a very unpopular president pursuing a very unpopular far-right agenda in cahoots with a far-right Congress, and what we were able to do in 2005, which we haven\u2019t been able to accomplish since, we won the governorships in both New Jersey and Virginia. Then the following year we flipped the House, and I\u2019m seeing a similar trend here. But the past is never prologue and what we have to do is build that infrastructure, recruit great candidates, and then organize, organize, organize with our message of a better deal and a brighter future for everybody.\u201d (Worth noting that in the first half of 2017, Democrats went 0-3 in three special Congressional elections). Last month, Democrats unveiled their policy goals called \u201cA Better Deal,\u201d  but it was not embraced by many liberal Democrats, and a Quinnipiac University poll  showed that 54% of Americans hadn\u2019t heard about it. Part of the problem for Democrats is that the spotlight is fixed solely on Trump these days, making it difficult for other political news to break through. \u201cHe sucks up the oxygen, but it\u2019s one thing to suck up the oxygen with affirmative things to help people. He\u2019s been sucking up the oxygen in the room by firing all of his people, by ensnarling his administration in scandal,\u201d Perez said. \u201cI mean the culture of chaos and corruption in this administration is off the charts, and I don\u2019t think the American people want to normalize chaos; they don\u2019t want to normalize ethical lapses; they want people fighting for a better future for them \u2013 that\u2019s what Democrats are doing.\u201d Listen here DNC Chair Tom Perez: Trump is a 'fraud' But for all of the controversy swirling around Trump, the Republican National Committee is outpacing the DNC in the critical measurement of fundraising. The latest Federal Election Commission reports show that the RNC has nearly $44 million cash-on-hand, while the DNC has $7.5 million in the bank but is also burdened by $3.3 million of debt. \u201cWell we\u2019re making progress; we have more work to do,\u201d said Perez. \u201cWhen I walked into the DNC, we had to rebuild our systems, and our fundraising department was a very good group of people, but we needed to quadruple their size and we\u2019re in the process of doing just that.\u201d Perez said he emphasizes to donors that helping to pay for rebuilding the party infrastructure \u201cain\u2019t sexy,\u201d but noted it is critical to success. \u201cYou know when your plumbing goes out in your house or the water pipes in Flint (Michigan) corrode, it has life threatening consequences,\u201d Perez said. \u201cAnd similarly when the political infrastructure corrodes, we lose elections.\u201d As Perez tries to keep the party focused on the November elections in New Jersey and Virginia, the DNC remains ground zero for Russia\u2019s hacking in the 2016 election. Perez did not go into detail when asked about the investigation other than to note that \u201cfrom the onset of this investigation we\u2019ve cooperated with the FBI. We continue to cooperate with people on Capitol Hill, and we\u2019ll do so throughout.\u201d Charlottesville spotlights Trump's toxic failure to lead Rebuilding, reforming, uniting and winning elections in 2017 and 2018 are some pretty difficult challenges for a person to shoulder. But that is not the only responsibility Perez is saddled with in his role as DNC chair. The wide open 2020 Democratic presidential primary is just around the corner. \u201cWell the most important thing we\u2019re going to do is to build a fair, level playing field for everybody,\u201d Perez said. \u201cI welcome the debate. I think there is going to be a bumper crop of candidates and that the American people are going to see a very robust Democratic Party. What will unite all of them is that they are all fighting for a better deal and a brighter future and better tomorrows for everyone, not just a few at the top. And what we\u2019re doing at the DNC is making sure we build the infrastructure, the organizing infrastructure, the technology infrastructure so that whoever \u2026 becomes the nominee that they can walk into a DNC that enables them to sprint across the finish line. Listen here While Perez said he hopes ideas and ideals are what helps to unite his party, it may just be mutual disgust for Trump that will act as the super glue for Democrats. Below are some of excerpts of my interview with DNC Chairman Tom Perez. This Q&A has been edited for brevity, clarity and flow. Mark Preston: As you look at the current state of play right now, what is the Democratic plan to address Donald Trump in this off year? Tom Perez: Step one is that we have to take on Donald Trump in all of these areas that he\u2019s trying to take America back, and make America weak, not make America great. Equally important though, we can\u2019t simply be against Donald Trump. We\u2019ve got to articulate what we are for, and we have always been fighting for a fair shake for everyone. Listen here  Preston: (W)hen you were running for chairman, \u2026 it was a bit of a contentious fight. There was a lot of criticism from the grassroots about the battle between establishment Democrats and grassroots Democrats. \u2026 What is being done behind the scenes to try to bridge the divide between those two (factions)? Perez: Every single day we are leading with our values. \u2026 If we want to address income inequality in this country, one of the most important things we can do is support efforts for people to unionize and form a union. When unions succeed, the middle class succeeds. When unions succeed, income inequality goes down, and what we have to do as a party is be out there on the issues that matter the most to people: health care, good jobs, the efforts to cut support for public education, we have to articulate what we stand for.\u201d Listen here Preston: Is the focus right now for the DNC, when you\u2019re looking at priorities, to get back the House of Representatives? Perez: Well, that\u2019s a very big part of what we\u2019re trying to do. We have a more immediate focus, which is 2017 because you know what, you win Virginia, you win New Jersey, you lay the foundation for future success. What we try to do is to make sure we\u2019re not only winning elections today but we\u2019re building the infrastructure for sustained success.",

Jonathan Tasini: Despite a new slogan, Democrats will keep failing unless they articulate a stable economic plan We need party leaders who will finally admit that the \"free market\" system cannot be fixed, he writes Democrats would like voters to believe the party\u2019s slogan for its new economic agenda rolled out Monday, \u201cA Better Deal,\u201d describes a program aimed at fighting for regular people \u2013 even though it mostly rings like a sales pitch for a discounted item at a shopping mall. Worse, the specifics of the strategy are a path to more electoral failure, because \u201cA Better Deal\u201d embraces falsehoods about economic power while leaving a bankrupt system unchallenged. Right after the presidential election, I argued that the crisis facing Democrats, which was at least a decade of electoral losses in the making, boiled down to a failure to show voters any clear differences between the parties when it comes to propping up a failed economic system. As it now stands, it\u2019s a system in which lobbyists shower both parties with money, tax cuts for business and keeping taxes too low on the wealthy are a bipartisan goal, health care is still something to leave in the hands of insurance companies and, above all, the glory of the \u201cfree market\u201d is extolled by Democrats and Republicans. Until Democrats display the strength to reject the system, they\u2019ll continue to lose, and \u201cA Better Deal\u201d is just more of the same. The stupefying foolishness of the plan is evident in three main points from Monday\u2019s s outline offered in op-eds by Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer and three Democratic House members in which they purport to give the broad strokes of the party\u2019s economic strategy. Democrats: Our plan for a better deal Schumer specifically says the party will fight to increase \u201cworkers\u2019 incomes by lifting the minimum wage to $15.\u201d He and the House Democrats also talk a lot about retraining workers to give them skills to get higher-paying jobs. Most of the rest of the mumbo-jumbo is the typical warmed-over \u201cinnovation\u201d and \u201cdon\u2019t we all love small business\u201d standard fare that excites elite policy wonks but is largely irrelevant to voters. Perhaps the most glaring omission here is that none of these party leaders use the word \u201cunion\u201d even once. That isn\u2019t entirely surprising: The typical party ethos going back to Bill Clinton has been to minimize the embrace of labor unions, beyond the occasional rhetorical gesture, except when it\u2019s election season (read: when the party needs donations and campaign troops). But the \u201cFight for 15\u201d has been primarily funded by unions, some of whom frankly were dragged into the battle by other affiliated organizations who were less than inspired by the Obama administration\u2019s and congressional Democrats\u2019 support for a paltry minimum wage hike to $10.10. To the consternation of the Wall Street wing of the party, the Bernie Sanders movement made $15-an-hour a central part of its economic message, and forced $15-an-hour as a goal, into the party\u2019s 2016 platform. The fight for Democrats' soul has begun And if raising wages and preserving pensions is what Democrats want, they\u2019re not going to get it without growing the power of unions. Unions built the middle class. Wages are low because, over the past several decades, employers have effectively stolen the productivity gains made by workers \u2014 and only by revitalizing unions, publicly, aggressively and explicitly, will that change. Schumer and the House Democrats compounded this problem Monday by perpetuating the myth that workers need more skills to get \u201chigh-paying\u201d jobs and that politicians can ensure they get those skills by, you guessed it, that sure-fire election winner: giving a tax credit to companies. This has been an untenable proposition going back to the 1990s, when then-Labor Secretary Robert Reich flogged his elitist \u201csymbolic analysts\u201d solution, in which workers can all find a place in the creative and knowledge economies, which supposedly fix everything. Reality is more difficult. Skills have nothing to do with the class warfare underway in the country. Workers are not dumb. It\u2019s simple: There is no reason a retail worker, janitor or any worker who isn\u2019t \u201chighly skilled\u201d can\u2019t be paid a high wage, other than the lack of power to demand it through collective bargaining. If Democrats want to win, here's what they must fix Even so, today\u2019s Democrats, with the \u201cA Better Deal\u201d slogan, have the temerity to channel Franklin Delano Roosevelt\u2019s \u201cNew Deal\u201d by explicitly stating, as Schumer does in his op-ed, \u201cOur better deal is not about expanding the government.\u201d Shame on them. That position betrays a continued acceptance by Democrats of a decadeslong Republican talking point that demonizes government, adopts the idea that taxes are too high and puts blind faith in the \u201cfree market.\u201d Our problem has not been a growing government or a spending problem. It\u2019s the priorities political leaders have set and how we raise money. And it\u2019s a continued belief in \u201cfree market\u201d neo-liberalism: a system that relies on market mechanisms, argues against expanding the role of the state and social services, and empowers corporations and wealthy individuals at the expense of citizens. To take the current policy debate around health care as the perfect example, a large majority of people support universal, single-payer health care, which would entail expanding government\u2019s role. Yet, Schumer is trying to short-circuit universal health care as a party priority, even though it would end up saving businesses and average people hundreds of billions of dollars.  The ideological straitjacket \u201cA Better Deal\u201d creates goes deeper than a neglect of history or a refusal to empower citizens. It\u2019s a failure of political philosophy and imagination. Its advocates say they want to protect the promise of Social Security and Medicare. But embracing a growing government would expand Social Security and Medicare, and, then, also fund free college education, and guaranteed annual incomes and a livable pension. We could fund some of that if, for example, we just cast off (a quarter-century after the Cold War ended) the government\u2019s bipartisan priority to underwrite a bloated military and maintain the country\u2019s prominence as the largest weapons merchant in the world, arming repressive regimes like Saudi Arabia. Of course, to do any of these things requires a political spine, and leaders who finally admit that the \u201cfree market\u201d system cannot be fixed. Until the Democrats get this message, they might as well have a slogan closer to \u201cBetter Hygiene, Better Grammar, Better Front Lawns.\u201d At least it won\u2019t mislead.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Jay Parini, a poet and novelist, teaches at Middlebury College in Vermont. His latest book is \u201cNew and Collected Poems, 1975-2015.\u201d The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of the author. Jay Parini: Obama's muted response as Trump tries to shift blame on to him is troubling He says whatever Obama's reason (perhaps philosophical), response is misguided as his policies are being overturned The contrast could not be more extreme:  a loud, pushy, anti-intellectual President Donald Trump versus a soft-spoken, recessive, philosophical former president, Barack Obama.   The difference has become especially glaring in recent days, with Trump repeatedly breaking the tradition of a new president refraining from dissing his predecessor. Trump has, in fact, gone out of his way to attack Obama, as in his recent nonsensical reversal wherein he attacked Obama for his lack of response to Russian meddling in the 2016 election:  \u201cObama did NOTHING,\u201d Trump tweeted.  He went on to accuse Obama of colluding with the Russians! Trump continues to take aim at Obama legacy By now the world is familiar with this Trump ploy:  He engages in unscrupulous business deals, so he labels Hillary Clinton \u201cCrooked Hillary.\u201d  He lies, so he calls Ted Cruz \u201cLyin\u2019 Ted.\u201d  On and on.  Anyone who calls him out on any failure gets the same accusation hurled back in his or her face, and \u2013 to a shocking extent \u2013 this trick works.  Or it works with Trump supporters, who don\u2019t seem to care if he wrecks their health care, allows factories to poison their water, or provides massive tax cuts for the rich people they admire so much.  THIS is making America great again. The truth is, Obama confronted Putin directly about intervening in our political system and put in place sanctions, though he clearly didn\u2019t do enough.  \u201cI feel like we sort of choked,\u201d one former colleague of Obama has said, according to an article in the Washington Post.   This is too bad, as the Russians pulled off the crime of the century, possibly derailing Clinton, a tough critic of Russia. Today we have an incompetent President who (for reasons we might discover soon enough) appears unwilling to oppose the Russian regime. Obama\u2019s weak responses to Trump have been troubling.  I don\u2019t know why he didn\u2019t simply open the intelligence files on Putin to the American public, saying:  \u201cMy God, look what the Russians are trying to do!  Put up your guard!\u201d  There can be no sound reason for not alerting the people of this country to a major attack on their most cherished right, the right to vote. I\u2019m also unhappy about Obama\u2019s response to Trumpcare.  His language was strong enough: Trump tries to shift hacking focus to Obama \u201cThe Senate bill, unveiled today, is not a health care bill,\u201d he wrote in a Facebook post, blasting the Republican legislation that seeks to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act.  He calls the proposed Republican plan \u201ca massive transfer of wealth from middle-class and poor families to the richest people in America.\u201d That is exactly what he should have said, but why is he only saying it in a Facebook post rather than in remarks to the press or in speeches. Again and again, Trump strikes and Obama turns the other cheek.  What\u2019s going on here? There is a longstanding Christian tradition of turning the other cheek, and that\u2019s usually the best approach to abuse.  But one should remember that Jesus also turned over the tables of merchants and moneychangers in Herod\u2019s Temple in Jerusalem.  He accused them of transforming the holiest site in Judaism into a \u201cden of thieves.\u201d (Mark 11:17)  I wonder if the analogy here, with Trump and his cohorts, isn\u2019t more apt than we think. A friend of mine recently suggested that Obama was, at heart, a quietist.  This is a mystical tradition that involves a \u201cquieting\u201d of the conscious mind, a withdrawal into the deepest layers of self, even self-annihilation.   Political quietism involves stepping back from the activities of the world to focus on religious truth, and it condemns self-aggrandizement and the naked reach for power.  It rejects the quest for wealth. Trump to Obama in 2013: Do not attack Syria But quietism seems misguided in this context.  Political life is where we create a community.  What is government but our community made visible?  If we are to create a community that takes pride in how it cares for its own, one that promotes decent values, such as humility and tolerance and the wish to share, we have no choice but to step forward, to declare ourselves and speak up for our values. Obama needs to find his voice now in ways that, during his time in the Oval Office, he was too often reluctant to do, perhaps fearing the immense power of the bully pulpit But now there is a real bully in the pulpit, and Obama \u2013 like the rest of us \u2013 has no choice but to speak, and to act. My hope for Obama is that, in his post-presidency, he steps forward boldly to say whatever feels true in his mind.  And he must do so in the most public ways.  I would urge him to speak up, not indirectly on Facebook, but to declare himself more publicly and without reservation, revealing his ideas, his passions.  There may be some fatal flaw here, of course, one that disallows a full-throated singing of his song.  But I hope it isn\u2019t so.",

Andelman, member of the board of contributors of USA Today, is the author of \u201cA Shattered Peace: Versailles 1919 and the Price We Pay Today.\u201d He formerly served as a foreign correspondent for The New York Times and CBS News. Follow him on Twitter @DavidAndelman. This opinions in this article belong to the author. At first glance, it appears that there are only two clear paths that the US can take when dealing with the Middle East: the Sunni path of Saudi Arabia and the bulk of its Gulf allies, on the one hand; or the Shiite path represented by Iran. There is the path of dictators \u2013 like Egypt\u2019s autocratic Abdel Fattah el-Sisi, the blinkered and aging royal family of Saudi Arabia, and the corrupt and helpless rulers of Iraq \u2013 all Sunnis. By contrast, there is the young and desperately eager majority of Iranians, all Shiites, seeking to drag their nation out from under the yoke of a medieval clerical oppression. Melania Trump gets rave reviews in Saudi press The Trump administration, seduced by an effusive Saudi welcome \u2013 in sharp contrast to anything provided his predecessor, Barack Obama \u2013 may be taking the wrong road. The correct, if difficult, third path for America is to straddle between Sunni and Shiite. But going on the evidence of Trump\u2019s first overseas trip to Saudi Arabia and Israel \u2013 both firm enemies of Iran and critical of the Obama administration\u2019s perceived warmth towards Iran \u2013 this is a path that the President seems determined to ignore. Such a path is especially important since the landslide victory Friday of Iran\u2019s President Hassan Rouhani in his bid for a second term, and the suggestion that Iran\u2019s Shiite leadership may be preparing for a new and more enlightened future for its people. Of course, while that new road can be paved with good intentions, we know where such paths can lead. Still, it is of vital importance that we give these youths a chance to explore it. Rouhani\u2019s 57% victory over his opponents in Friday\u2019s election was clearly a clarion call from the nation\u2019s increasingly young, urbanized and westernized middle class for a recognition of their aspirations for a dramatic break with the past. Yet the Trump administration seems hell bent on ignoring all such cries. What incentive is there for Iran to move toward peace, toward the West and toward the US if we become known not as peacemakers but simply arms merchants to Iran\u2019s sworn Sunni enemies in Saudi Arabia? At the very moment Rouhani and his supporters were celebrating his victory, Trump was signing $100 billion worth of arms sales to Saudi Arabia. And hours later, President Trump was telling a hand-picked crowd of Sunni leaders in Riyadh: \u201cUntil the Iranian regime is willing to be a partner for peace, all nations of conscience must work together to isolate Iran, deny it funding for terrorism, and pray for the day when the Iranian people have the just and righteous government they so richly deserve.\u201d It was decidedly not a gesture to the reality that this is precisely what these very Iranian people voted for two days earlier. Yet under the leadership of the blinkered Trump administration and the Sunni dictators to which it has hitched America\u2019s wagons, these forces of potential progress in Iran are being given few choices but to look elsewhere for weapons to defend their Shiite faith and their nation against the weapons being stockpiled by their Sunni enemies. And there will be no shortages of potential arms merchants to Iran. We have only to look to the list of nations congratulating Rouhani on his remarkable victory. Russian President Vladimir Putin, China\u2019s Xi Jinping, even the foreign policy chief of the European Union, Frederica Mogherini, weighed in with warm wishes. President Trump in Israel: Live updates But there is more to the new era that may mark the path of Iran. If, as now appears increasingly likely following the weekend\u2019s events in Riyadh, the Sunni-Shiite divide continues to widen, it will have unfortunate consequences for the war on terrorism that President Trump seems so intent to pursue in short-sighted alliance with questionable partners. For while the battle against ISIS is quite clearly a battle \u2013 as President Trump has expressed it \u2013 between good and evil, it is also a conflict that has gone on for centuries between Sunni and Shiite. Today, it is ISIS whose leaders profess the Sunni religion, as did al Qaeda before them and a host of other rebel forces and tribes into a dark and terrifying past. Few forces have been effectively arrayed against them. Kurdish troops have held their own in a succession of bitter and deadly battles. It is Iran, and its powerful Shiite forces, that \u2013 if unleashed en masse against ISIS in their strongholds in Syria and what remains of their holdings in Iraq \u2013 could end the reign of terror of ISIS in the blink of an eye. Trump and his advisers seem to be acting on the ancient pronouncement that the enemy of my enemy is my friend. They simply have been unable or unwilling to identify who could be our real and true enemies, and who our long-term friends. Iran, apparently, no matter how vocally its people scream for change, will continue to find only deaf ears from Washington to Riyadh.",

He was a 2014 Harvard University Nieman fellow. Follow him on Twitter: @ijbailey. The views expressed are his own. Issac Bailey: As a party, Democrats should redouble their efforts to help those in the lower economic and middle classes, even when it goes underappreciated They should do so without instituting purity tests against Wall Street, he writes Democrats would be unwise to ignore Hillary Clinton\u2019s recent assessment of the 2016 election cycle. \u201cIf the election had been on October 27, I would be your president,\u201d Clinton told CNN\u2019s Christiane Amanpour at a Women for Women International event on Tuesday. She\u2019s right. Downplaying the impact of events, unprecedented in modern politics, last fall would send the Democratic Party on a misadventure from which it might not recover \u2013 even as it scrambles to redefine itself for the next generation. The fight to redefine the party began in earnest when Bernie Sanders\u2019 brand of socialism went toe-to-toe with Clinton\u2019s moderate approach. It picked up steam, powered by shock and angst, after Clinton lost to Donald Trump in November. It grew white hot as a gaggle of party officials vied to become the next leader of the Democratic National Committee. Now, after the first 100 days under an opposition president and Congress, the party has entered the circular firing squad phase as members fight uselessly over things like the meaning of President Barack Obama\u2019s being paid $400,000 by Wall Street for a speech and new data showing that disaffected voters are convinced that President Donald Trump cares more about the poor and middle class than Democrats do. In one eye-popping finding in polling by Priorities USA, a liberal super PAC, twice as many of the Obama voters who voted for Trump said Democrats\u2019 policies favor the wealthy compared to those who believed the same about Trump. The reality on the ground can\u2019t be more different than what Obama/Trump voters perceive, and veering toward the \u201cpurity politics\u201d advocated by the Sanders wing of the party will do little \u2013 if anything \u2013 to change that. Their perceptions ignore the fact that the Democratic Party used up much of its political capital and sacrificed its control over Congress to achieve milestones for middle-class and poor Americans. They brought health care to more than 20 million Americans, literally saving lives and offering a buffer against personal bankruptcies caused by medical emergencies. They implemented the most comprehensive Wall Street reform in a generation, a law that included a powerful consumer protection agency that has protected the poor and middle class in countless ways. They fought to increase the minimum wage,  including pushing for it to be raised to $15 per hour nationwide. Those efforts yielded results. In combination with a bailout of the auto industry and the largest fiscal stimulus in US history, they helped pull us out of the Great Recession and produced the largest annual increase in wages ever, most of which went to the poor and middle class. Clinton, Trump can't stop airing their 2016 grievances And it isn\u2019t just about the past; Democrats are still fighting from their minority position. They were the first in line to beat back the proposed Trump budget, which slated major cuts for programs that help the neediest Americans while providing massive tax breaks for the already wealthy. Meanwhile, Trump\u2019s policies have been widely cited as favoring rich men such as himself, and his first 100 days in office have included a bevy of conflicts of interest and questions about the use of taxpayer money at his personal properties and top advisers. What\u2019s more, there\u2019s data suggesting many of those Obama/Trump voters were less concerned about losing the things for which Democrats have been fighting and more about making sure those unlike them don\u2019t receive \u201ctoo much.\u201d The question remains: What should Democrats do about it? As a party, they should redouble their efforts to help those in the lower economic and middle classes, even when it goes underappreciated, and should do so without instituting purity tests against Wall Street. It\u2019s natural for a party to undergo a painful, public kind of soul searching after a devastating loss, and changing nothing makes little sense. Democrats should search their souls, but not abandon who they are and what they\u2019ve done. It would be unwise for Democrats to overreact to what was a Black Swan of an election. As the former candidate herself reminded us, the FBI director inserted himself directly into the campaign cycle less than two weeks from voting day with an announcement that wounded one candidate and helped the other. And Russia undermined the democratic process with well-timed leaks aimed at harming that same candidate. And still, Clinton won the popular vote by 3 million votes and would be president had 80,000 votes been different in three states, a total amounting to a rounding error, given that more than 135 million votes were cast nationwide.  The Democratic Party is far from perfect and in too many ways has allowed the corrupting power of money to influence it. A reexamination of its values and principles and message to the poor and middle class is long overdue, not just because they lost in November, but because millions of Americans believe they don\u2019t care and have felt that way for years. That doesn\u2019t mean the party should be shy about highlighting its differences with the GOP on issues that affect the neediest Americans most.",

Follow him on Twitter: @domerdozain The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. Trump is due to become the first president since Reagan to address NRA annual meeting Dominic Erdozain: Speech could mark new milestone in Indian summer of gun rights On Friday, Donald Trump is due to become the first president since Ronald Reagan in 1983 to address the annual meeting of the National Rifle Association. If Trump\u2019s speech in Atlanta registers a fraction of the impact of Reagan\u2019s, it will mark another milestone in this Indian summer of gun rights. For the past several years, the NRA has advanced a radical agenda of unlimited freedom as the birthright of every American, and the vision is passing into law. For decades, a Supreme Court ruling declaring that the Constitution supports the individual right to own a gun was the holy grail of firearms activism. That was achieved in 2008, but already a decision described by Justice John Paul Stevens as \u201ca dramatic upheaval in the law\u201d feels hesitant by today\u2019s standards of \u201ccampus carry,\u201d adrenalized \u201cstand your ground\u201d laws, and the NRA\u2019s current campaign to make concealed-weapon permits as acceptable across the states as drivers\u2019 licenses. In the world of the gun, extreme is becoming the new normal. This revolution may not have been possible without the \u201cspecial bond\u201d forged between Reagan and the NRA in 1983. Orlando spotlights our big constitutional responsibility on guns The NRA then had recently reorganized around a militancy untypical of its first century of existence, centering on a newly individualistic reading of the Second Amendment. It was led by a group of activists so averse to compromise that they had been collectively fired by the old guard in 1976, only to stage a dramatic takeover in 1977, remaking the organization in their own image. Out went the sober mission statement of \u201cFirearms Safety Education, Marksmanship Training, Shooting for Recreation.\u201d In came the second half of the Second Amendment, etched in oversize splendor at the entrance of NRA headquarters: \u201cthe right of the people to keep and bear arms, shall not be infringed.\u201d The bit about the \u201cmilitia,\u201d the \u201cstate\u201d and the need for it to be \u201cwell regulated\u201d was omitted. Trump: The Second Amendment candidate we need That a revolt became a revolution owed more than a little to Reagan. The NRA had endorsed him over Jimmy Carter in 1980, the first time it had officially supported a candidate for the White House, and a grateful President returned the favor with startling verve. Looking back at the 1983 speech, what is striking is not just the flattery, the praise, the repeated effusions of \u201cI believe in you,\u201d it is the mastery with which a commander in chief elevates domestic gun rights into the wider mission of national security, peppering his prepared remarks with hushed asides about progress in the Middle East, foiled drug-running operations and the menace of communist espionage. Reagan established a perfect parallel between American innocence (\u201cIt isn\u2019t America that attacks and occupies other countries\u201d) and the innocence of the law-abiding citizen, slandered by gun control fanatics: \u201cDon\u2019t they understand that most violent crimes are not committed by decent, law-abiding citizens?\u201d The President placed the armed citizen on a sacred continuum that included George Washington, Abraham Lincoln and a modern, under-equipped military. \u201cIf they can put their lives on the line to protect our way of life, then, by golly, we can give them the weapons,\u201d he protested, honoring his audience as collaborators in statecraft. The same applied at home: \u201cAs we crack down on criminals,\u201d he continued, \u201cwe\u2019re trying to move forward on another front: to reform the firearms laws which needlessly interfere with the rights of legitimate gun owners like yourselves.\u201d With shades of Teddy Roosevelt, he went out of his way to praise a civilian outfit such as \u201cArizona\u2019s Sun City Posse, a group which has had great success roping in the bad guys.\u201d Applause interrupted Reagan\u2019s delivery no fewer than 30 times. When he deftly remarked it is not the government that creates the right to bear arms, the crowd roared and the Phoenix Civic Plaza rattled to the sound of cowboy boots striking the ground. It was a master class. The \u201cnasty truth,\u201d the President continued, in cool, realpolitik mode, was that gun control doesn\u2019t work. It punishes only those who obey the law. Far better to get tough on \u201ccareer criminals\u201d and trust honest people to use weapons wisely. \u201cLocking them up, the hard-core criminals, and throwing away the key is the best gun-control law we could ever have,\u201d he quietly thundered. \u201cWe will never disarm any American who seeks to protect his or her family from fear and harm.\u201d This was more than anyone had expected. For Harlon Carter, executive vice president and architect of the new militancy, Reagan\u2019s speech was a stunning vindication. And he needed it. As a young man, Carter had been involved in a vigilante killing, his conviction for murder overturned on a technicality. The incident at once embodied and embarrassed the logic of righteous gun ownership, and he initially wouldn\u2019t comment on the story when it broke in The New York Times. Other NRA leaders were infamous for unfounded speculation that the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. and Robert Kennedy had been killed as part of a plot to advance gun control. Such was the world Reagan entered in 1983. The take-home from Phoenix, wrote Joan Burbick, was that \u201cthe NRA was not the breeding ground of gun nuts. It was the fountain of freedom, legitimized in its politics by the President of the United States.\u201d This year\u2019s convention, billed as a \u201ccelebration of freedom,\u201d continues this tradition of gentrified radicalism, with 80,000 of the NRA\u2019s 4 million-plus members expected to attend. Self-defense, we will be told, is America\u2019s \u201cfirst freedom,\u201d and one that guarantees all others. But the real question is whether the opposite is now true. Do gun rights smother more basic rights? For conservative politicians troubled by gun violence, does the NRA\u2019s zeal to elevate the Second Amendment place a controlling hand upon the freedoms of expression secured by the First?  In 2000, Trump criticized Republicans for slavishly walking \u201cthe NRA line\u201d on gun control, only to reverse his stance in 2015 with an unqualified commitment to \u201cprotect and extend the rights of law-abiding gun owners.\u201d Having previously supported the ban on assault rifles, he now offered his approval for a weapon \u201cused by tens of millions of Americans.\u201d Is Trump a footnote on Harlon Carter\u2019s old threat that \u201cno politician in America, mindful of his political career, would want to challenge our legitimate goals\u201d? Or is he a true believer? As in 1983, there is an element of payback for support rendered in the general election. But the reluctance of either George H.W. Bush or George W. Bush to grace the event reveals something about the significance of a president standing shoulder to shoulder with the gun lobby. The former famously resigned from the NRA in 1995 when Wayne LaPierre, executive vice president then and now, referred to federal agents as \u201cjack-booted thugs.\u201d Trump\u2019s appearance at the NRA\u2019s Institute for Legislative Action is a tangible moment in America\u2019s investment in firearms. As Reagan proved better than he knew: In the gun\u2019s restless pursuit of legitimacy, words are also weapons.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Michael D\u2019Antonio, the author of \u201cThe Truth About Trump,\u201d is writing Trump Watch, a series of columns on President-elect Donald Trump for CNN Opinion. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his. Michael D'Antonio: On Friday, Donald Trump will be inaugurated as baby boomer-in-chief His ascension to power makes sense when you consider him in the context of his generation Baby boomers, including Trump, were defined by a rejection of social norms and an embrace of self-absorption The man who will put his hand on the Lincoln Bible on Friday is unlike any president in living memory. But he does not defy understanding. In fact, Donald Trump is a product of his generation, a profoundly narcissistic president who should be regarded as the baby boomer-in-chief. Boomers came of age in a time of unrivaled wealth and devastating political crisis. Consumerism was matched by an explosion in mass media as television grew from a novelty into an overwhelming cultural force. The Vietnam War and Watergate combined with the trauma of assassinations and riots corroded public trust in authorities and institutions. The result was a rejection of social norms and an intense focus on the self. This is the generation that indulged in New Age navel-gazing, declared that \u201cgreed is good\u201d and more than doubled the divorce rate. The clich\u00e9 view of the \u201960s and \u201870s is filled with images of idealistic flower children and anti-war protests. But the lasting effect of all the upheaval was not liberal idealism. Instead, the boomers turned out to be remarkably self-absorbed, cynical and materialistic.Tom Wolfe called them the \u201cme generation,\u201d and Christopher Lasch warned that they were creating a culture of narcissism where success \u201chas to be ratified by publicity.\u201d When Lasch noted this drive, in the 1970s, the media was offering new ways for people to seek and exploit fame. Magazines such as People and Us and TV programs like \u201cLifestyles of the Rich and Famous\u201d proliferated and encouraged the pursuit of fame for fame\u2019s sake. Track Trump\u2019s life story and you can see he has made every effort, at every stage of his life, to have his success ratified by not just publicity, but enormous acclaim. Adept at manipulating the press, he first pushed his way into the newspapers. Next,Trump mastered television, magazines and finally the web. The image he presented was always bigger and richer than his reality, and he could be shocking in his attention-seeking. Only a man obsessed with his own celebrity would use a fake persona to brag to the press about how beautiful women stalk him. Who but a narcissist would pay for full-page newspaper ads to express his opinions about the events of the day? Perhaps only Trump would begin a sentence with the phrase \u201cPart of the beauty of me\u201d or declare, after describing America\u2019s problems, \u201cI alone can fix it.\u201d However, narcissism is only one of several baby boomer hallmarks that Trump will bring with him to office. Another is the cynicism that is evident in his lifelong effort to defy the norms that govern everyone else. \u201cQuestion Authority\u201d was an oft-used slogan of the \u201960s, and at the time it inspired group actions like sit-ins and protest marches. Rep. John Lewis practiced this type of defiance in 1965 when he confronted the authorities who enforced racism in Selma, Alabama, and suffered a fractured skull. He did so, of course, in the service of a greater good; his practice of civil disobedience was a strategy to achieve a moral end. Rep. John Lewis: 'Get in good trouble' Other baby boomer activists engaged in community organizing of the sort a young Barack Obama did for $10,000 a year on Chicago\u2019s South Side.  However, most boomers did not sacrifice much or take action to improve the quality of life for their fellow Americans. Although many today feel they participated in the campaigns for equality, in fact it was a tiny fraction of the boomer cohort that took action against the \u201csystem.\u201d Trump, who told me he thought the Vietnam War was \u201cstupid\u201d but did nothing to protest it, was more typical of the middle class and wealthy men of his generation who found ways to stay out of the military. Trump\u2019s family paid for him to attend private college, which made him eligible for draft deferment. After school, he claimed some tiny defects on his heels (bone spurs), which qualified him for deferment. The authorities gave him a pass. Of course, Trump was just one of many who avoided serving. For men like Trump, escaping service when 50,000 of their peers died fighting had little effect on their pursuit of success.  And the product of one of the richest and most powerful families in New York, the system usually worked quite well for Trump. When it didn\u2019t, he was happy to challenge it or subvert it. In the early 1970s, when federal officials demanded his family firm comply with fair housing rules that protected minority applicants for rentals, Trump responded with accusations of \u201creverse racism\u201d that turned the concept of fair housing rules upside down. (The tactic failed, but Trump made his point.) A few years after his battle with the feds, Trump manipulated authorities in New York to push competitors out of the way to gain control of a redevelopment site near Grand Central Terminal. When asked to submit contracts proving he had exclusive rights to the property, Trump handed over an unsigned document. He defied the officials to catch him in the act and got away with it. The cultural revolution of the 1960s was a grab bag of rule-breaking ideas that ranged from the profound concepts of equality for women to the rejection of traditional religion. Some people went so far as to join utopian communes. No one embraced every aspect of this generational construct. Trump welcomed the sexual revolution, which liberated young people from traditional morality and cultivated the playboy image. His sex scandal of the late 1980s, three marriages and sexually-predatory talk further proved his libertine credentials. Trump also developed a cynical view of how the world works, and he joined it with his own version of the radical \u2013 \u201cby any means necessary\u201d \u2013 action advocated by Malcolm X. But while Malcom X and others violated social norms on behalf of a cause, Trump did it out of self-interest. The traditional norms that Trump violated were the ones that encouraged people to live with a certain humility, grace and dignity. As his generation embraced the \u201cgreed is good\u201d mentality made famous in the movie \u201cWall Street,\u201d Trump continuously bragged about his wealth and devoted himself to using his wealth as a way to demonstrate his superiority. Trump led the way when it came to bankruptcy, famously plunging his businesses into the red and then using the courts to escape much of the debt the firms owed to lenders and other creditors. Though Trump noted that bankruptcy was a fair legal remedy, previous generations attached more stigma to using the courts to evade debts. Now, thanks to Trump, it\u2019s regarded as a smart business strategy. He has proudly spoken of his ability to use bankruptcy as a business tool, while avoiding the subject of all those parties, from workers to lenders to contractors, who were hurt by his business failures. During his campaign for president, Trump won by breaking many of the rules that permit a vigorous competition but allow for the country to unite when it is over. Trump used mockery, threats of prosecution and personal insults against his opponent while he encouraged his supporters to rough up those who protested. Trump tweeted false data blaming black Americans for crimes against whites and, in one of his more bizarre moments, even invited agents of a foreign government, Russia, to steal emails from his opponent. Trump\u2019s response to the Russian hacking campaign, which American intelligence officials report was intended to aid him in the election, demonstrates that he is the ultimate example of an anti-establishment, narcissistic boomer who defines right and wrong according to self-interest. Russia\u2019s attack on the US election cast doubt on the legitimacy of the campaign and thus on the legitimacy of a president whose claim to a mandate had already been weakened by the fact that he gained office despite his opponent\u2019s decisive victory in the popular vote count. It's official: Clinton swamps Trump in popular vote As he demeaned intelligence officials who are united in their assessment of the Russian hack, Trump cast doubt on the legitimacy of their work. With his criticism of the intelligence community, Trump has willfully undermined trust in a key American institution, one vital to national defense. This effort echoes his effort to delegitimize the election process during the campaign \u2013 he called it \u201crigged\u201d \u2013 and a lifelong inclination to question the legitimacy of those who oppose him. The big problem for Trump is that a leader who plays the game of casting doubt on the motives, methods and standing of others runs the risk of having the tables turned. Generally, public support and goodwill confer the protection of legitimacy on elected officials. However, according to polls, Trump is the least-supported incoming president in decades with just 40% supporting him in a recent poll. Barack Obama\u2019s approval numbers at the same point in his transition was 83%.  As he assumes office, Trump will likely be the last \u201cme generation\u201d man or woman to serve as president. The man who spent a lifetime fighting for greater personal wealth, power and acclaim by any means necessary has yet to show any signs that he can also summon the idealism and self-sacrificing impulses shown by likes of John Lewis. Instead, Trump shows every sign of being the kind of disrespectful, self-indulgent, anarchistic and hedonistic boomer that made an entire generation look bad. Those who hope for better leadership in today\u2019s Washington would do well to look to others, like Lewis or war hero Sen. John McCain, who actually served and sacrificed in Vietnam. Neither of these men represents the attitudes of the \u201cme generation,\u201d perhaps because they were born before the baby boom began.",

            "article_content": "Puerto Rico voted Sunday in favor of US statehood Puerto Rico on Sunday overwhelmingly voted for statehood. But Congress, the only body that can approve new states, will ultimately decide whether the status of the US commonwealth changes. Ninety-seven percent of the votes in the nonbinding referendum favored statehood, an increase over the results of a 2012 referendum, official results from the State Electoral Commission show. It was the fifth such vote on statehood. \u201cToday, we the people of Puerto Rico are sending a strong and clear message to the US Congress \u2026 and to the world \u2026 claiming our equal rights as American citizens, Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rossell\u00f3 said in a news release. What do we really know about Puerto Rico? When outsiders think of Puerto Rico, a couple of things probably come to mind: It\u2019s a small island in the Caribbean. People mostly speak Spanish there. It\u2019s not a US state but has American ties. They were the Sharks in \u201cWest Side Story.\u201d (Wait, maybe they were the Jets?) But there\u2019s so much more to know. Some Puerto Ricans are raring to cozy up with America to jump-start a flagging economy; meanwhile, some residents would just as soon maintain the status quo, and others would prefer to break ties altogether. Momentum has been building for the island shaped like a postage stamp to join the union as the 51st state, so it\u2019s probably smart to start reading up about America\u2019s cousin to the south \u2013 its background, economic status and heritage. The Ta\u00edno Indians already called the island home when Christopher Columbus landed there in 1493, and it was settled around 1508 by Spanish explorer Juan Ponce de Le\u00f3n. It was eventually named Puerto Rico, which means \u201crich port\u201d and became a Spanish colony for about 400 years. The Spanish mined for gold and established agricultural plantations with slave labor, but the colony eventually became more valuable as a military outpost. The island came under US control in 1898 after the Spanish-American War. A 1950 federal law helped clarify the relationship between the United States and Puerto Rico, paving the way for a public vote on its new constitution. After it was approved in 1952 by the people of Puerto Rico, President Harry Truman, Congress and the Puerto Rican governor, the island became an official US commonwealth. What\u2019s the difference between a commonwealth and a territory? Not too much, except that commonwealths have their own constitutions. Puerto Rican residents have been US citizens since 1917 (thanks to the Jones Act), so they receive many of the same benefits and protections, with just a few differences. For one, they can truthfully say, \u201cDon\u2019t blame me, I didn\u2019t vote for them,\u201d when discussing the US presidency. While voters can participate in primary elections, they can\u2019t vote for president in the general election.  In 2016, 75% of Puerto Ricans voted for Marco Rubio in the Republican primary (and nearly 14% for Donald Trump) versus Hillary Clinton\u2019s 61% of the Democratic vote. Puerto Rico has a nonvoting delegate in Washington, called a resident commissioner. Back home, Puerto Rico has its own governor and legislative body. A definite plus to living on the island and one reason some might prefer things as they are: Puerto Ricans only have to pay federal income taxes on work they\u2019ve done in the States, and not at home. As a commonwealth, Puerto Rico gets US military protection and receives federal funding from the government for highways and social programs, just not as much as an official state gets. Citizens pay into Social Security and have access to Medicare and Medicaid, but instead of being eligible for Supplemental Security Income assistance, low-income, elderly and blind or disabled people can get help from a similar program run by the US Department of Health and Human Services. There could be a lot of changes in federal programs if Puerto Rico joins Team USA as a state, such as those for student loans, the GI Bill, Pell Grants and assistance programs for families and children. Options on the weekend referendum included remaining a commonwealth, becoming a state, entering \u201cfree association\u201d or becoming an independent nation. Free association is an official affiliation with the United States where Puerto Rico would still receive military assistance and funding. Four plebiscites, or popular votes, have been held to decide the commonwealth\u2019s status in relation to America. Three of four times, Puerto Rico residents voted against statehood (in 1967, 1993 and 1998). In a 2012 referendum the majority of voters for the first time chose statehood, but it didn\u2019t go anywhere. (Some argued the results should have been considered a \u201cno\u201d since more than one-third of voters left the part about alternative status blank.) Jorge Benitez, a political scientist at the University of Puerto Rico-Rio Piedras, said the only definite takeaway from the 2012 vote results at the time was that the people of Puerto Rico wanted a change in status. \u201cIt isn\u2019t clear what change we want, but we want change,\u201d he said. \u201cI think people just came to realize that the current relationship simply does not create the number of jobs that we need,\u201d Puerto Rico Secretary of State Kenneth McClintock said after that vote nearly five years ago. In 2012, 6% of voters opted to cut ties with the United States. \u201cWhat people have to understand about the need for independence is that there\u2019s a fear that\u2019s been instilled on the people in Puerto Rico that if we were independent we couldn\u2019t run our own country,\u201d activist Rosa Clemente, the 2008 vice presidential nominee for the Green Party, told CNN\u2019s W. Kamau Bell. After Sunday\u2019s successful fifth vote, the next step is another vote in October. Then there would need to be a statute passed by Congress that would lay out the details of the transition process over the next few years, which would end with statehood. If Congress does not pass a statute, Puerto Rico\u2019s status would remain as it is. The economy in Puerto Rico is in bad shape. Really bad shape, considering the commonwealth declared a form of bankruptcy on May 3 after having already defaulted a couple of times. Previously, Detroit\u2019s was the largest filing by a municipality in US history; it owed about $18 billion. Now Puerto Rico holds that record, owing its creditors $73 billion. What happened? Unemployment is high, holding steady about 11.5% since March, and almost half  the population is below the poverty level, about 46%. The team at CNN Money determined in 2016 that over time, the Puerto Rican government flat out spent too much, possibly because of a translation error in its constitution. Also, some laws had been changed by Congress, erasing tax breaks and business incentives Puerto Rico was counting on. Plus, a lot of people moved away. Statehood for Puerto Rico could help the island\u2019s economy bounce back faster because more money would come in from federal spending on programs (but keep in mind the offset for federal revenue from individual and corporate taxes). As of 2016, 3.4 million people called Puerto Rico home. If someone moves from Puerto Rico to the mainland, they are migrating. Remember, they\u2019re citizens, so they don\u2019t need passports or visas. In 2015, about 89,000 Puerto Ricans moved to the US mainland, a record high, according to analysis by the Puerto Rico Institute of Statistics, though about 25,000 returned to the island that year. Why is everybody taking off? A 2014 report by the Pew Research Center on Hispanic Trends indicates a variety of reasons, from opportunities for better jobs, higher salaries and nicer places to live. This leaves fewer people back home to pick up the slack, which means lower birthrates and less tax revenue to help get the economy back on track. In March 2014, Edwin Melendez, director of the Center for Puerto Rican Studies at Hunter College in New York, told CNN, \u201cIn Puerto Rico, there\u2019s a generalized perspective that there\u2019s a \u2018brain drain\u2019 because so many young professionals have left,\u201d  Melendez said, \u201cbut they aren\u2019t the only ones leaving. It\u2019s also labor workers and families.\u201d On the flip side, some people and businesses see valuable financial benefits in moving to Puerto Rico. Two laws enacted in 2012 give tax breaks to nonresidents and tax exemptions on investments for residents. The island brings in nearly $4 billion annually through the tourism industry, and hosts about 10 million visitors via the airports, according to the Puerto Rico Tourism Company. Multiple cruise lines make stops at the port of San Juan, adding even more visitors to the mix. El Yunque National Forest, the San Juan Historic Site, which includes Fort San Crist\u00f3bal, plus beautiful beaches and the streets of Old San Juan draw hordes of visitors. Unfortunately, the Zika virus, an illness spread through mosquito bites that causes birth defects and other neurological issues, has affected tourism numbers. More than 40,000 cases have been reported there since the epidemic began, and a public health emergency was declared. In June, the governor\u2019s office announced the epidemic was over. Puerto Rico\u2019s ethnic heritage is a blend of European, indigenous and African cultures. There\u2019s no one way to describe how native Puerto Ricans look today, former Miss Puerto Rico Universe Ingrid Rivera told Kamau Bell. \u201cYou can see absolutely everything here.\u201d Having Puerto Rican roots is like belonging to a huge, close-knit family, and those members who achieve success on the international stage are a source of immense pride back home. 'A superhero ... that looks like you' Take US Supreme Court Justice Sonia Sotomayor, whose family moved from Puerto Rico to the Bronx in the 1940s. The first Hispanic to sit on the nation\u2019s high court, she was sworn in in 2009. Sotomayor is treated like a rock star during her regular visits to Puerto Rico for speaking engagements. Puerto Rican native Rita Moreno summed up the importance of her heritage by recounting to NPR\u2019s \u201cWeekend Edition\u201d in 2013 that her best supporting actress Oscar win for \u201cWest Side Story\u201d (1961) became even more meaningful after she learned the Puerto Rican community had been cheering her on. \u201c(I)t really put me back in touch with my people, and I had a people. I had a people who knew all about me. I just didn\u2019t know about them.\u201d CNN\u2019s Darran Simon, Jeffrey Acevedo and Melonyce McAfee contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "President Donald Trump helped the nation reach a rare moment of racial reconciliation, but hardly anyone noticed. It was sparked by a recent White House photo op, when Trump gathered with Republican leaders to celebrate the House passing a bill to repeal and replace Obamacare. The event looked like the board meeting of an all-white-male golf club. Photos from the ceremony showed a phalanx of middle-aged white men heartily congratulating one another, with no woman or person of color in sight. Some photos released later did show some women at the event. But the surplus of white testosterone in the images sparked widespread outrage. One critic tweeted: \u201cMessage from another white guy: Yes, this is way too many white men in one place.\u201d Another white guy complained about a pattern of \u201coverwhelming white maleness\u201d in Trump administration photos. Someone even started a hashtag: #governmentsowhite. Lost in the criticism of those images, though, was something to celebrate: Many white people now get uneasy about seeing too many white guys in positions of power. The notion that the nation\u2019s leaders should look like the people they represent is becoming widely accepted. May 18: A man assaults a stranger for speaking Spanish: Hector Torres was talking to his mother on the phone at the Reno airport, when a man started yelling profanities and assaulted him. May 19: New Orleans mayor delivers a remarkable speech on race. After his city removed a monument to a Confederate Civil War hero, Mayor Mitch Landrieu said  the Confederacy was on the \u201cwrong side of history.\u201d May 20: A white Mississippi lawmaker calls for a lynching. State Rep. Karl Oliver made the comment on his Facebook page while denouncing the removal of Confederate monuments. He later apologized.May 22: Video of a woman\u2019s racist rant against a Latino shopper goes viral. The white woman in a Sprint store in Virginia calls the Latino shopper a \u201cf#$$ sp#c.\u201d May 22: A Walmart shopper goes after two women of color. The white shopper in Arkansas told a Latino woman to \u201cgo back to Mexico\u201d and called an African-American woman the N-word. But could the Trump administration make images of white men wielding all the power seem normal again? It\u2019ll never happen, says historian Jerald Podair \u2013 the United States is too racially diverse. The Trump Rose Garden photo bothered Podair but didn\u2019t change his view about the nation\u2019s future. \u201cWhites will not look at an all-white picture again and just take it for granted that it\u2019s normal,\u201d says Podair, a professor of history and American studies at Lawrence University in Wisconsin. \u201cThe demographic changes in America are continuing and inexorable.\u201d But what if the white male throwback optics aren\u2019t just annoying, but dangerous? Many people said this country would never return to the days when white people would casually sling the N-word at African-Americans in public; curse out Latinos for speaking Spanish; and openly call for a lynching. But it has. All of that actually took place over the past seven days in America. We\u2019ve entered an era in which traditional rules no longer apply. There\u2019s a growing belief among some conservative white men that they are persecuted for their skin color. If, say, you\u2019re a white, unemployed factory worker in Wisconsin looking for a job, you may scoff at talk of too many white men in one place. John Hawkins, a conservative blogger and columnist, says white men are blamed for everything from slavery to denying women the right to vote. \u201cWe live in the strongest, most powerful, most prosperous nation in human history and if we\u2019re being honest, white men probably deserve 95% of the credit for that,\u201d he wrote in a 2016 column entitled, \u201cWhen Did White Men Become The Bad Guys in America?\u201d \u201cThat may be unfair because women and black Americans weren\u2019t given the opportunity to significantly contribute for most of our nation\u2019s history, but it is true.\u201d Hawkins says the images coming from the Trump administration look the way they do because the Republican Party is predominantly white. \u201cRepublicans have just done a poor job of attracting minorities,\u201d says Hawkins, author of \u201c101 Things All Young Adults Should Know.\u201d \u201cPart of it is our fault. We\u2019ve done a terrible job of outreach.\u201d Some powerful Republicans defended the White House photo. During an interview with Andrea Mitchell on NBC\u2019s \u201cMeet the Press,\u201d Health and Human Services Secretary Tom Price said critics mischaracterized the optics of the event. Mitchell had asked Price why so few women were at the ceremony, particularly since the Republican health care bill would allow insurers to opt out of providing basic benefits to women such as maternity coverage and birth control. Price told Mitchell to look again at the photo. \u201cAndrea, come on. Look at that picture. Congresswoman Diane Black, the chair of the budget committee, I was standing next to her. Seema Verma, the administrator of CMS [Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services], I was standing right next to her.\u201d To which Mitchell responded: \u201cOut of a group of dozens and dozens of people, you can cite two or three women?\u201d The anger generated by the White House photo op is bigger than the debate over health care, though. The photo evoked the experience of millions of Americans for centuries. Countless images in history books, movies and politics sent the same message to women and people of color: You don\u2019t matter, but we do. That message is still being sent today by the optics of who holds the power in the US. White men make up 31% of the nation\u2019s population, yet 65% of its elected officials. They out earn all groups of women \u2013 white and otherwise \u2013 as well as black and Hispanic men. Only Asian-American men out earn white men. Most of the nation\u2019s Fortune 500 CEOs and board members are white men. We live in the strongest, most powerful, most prosperous nation in human history and if we\u2019re being honest, white men probably deserve 95% of the credit for that. John Hawkins, a conservative blogger and columnist Many people take it for granted that white men should be in charge, studies show. If, for example, you step onto a commercial flight and see two women in the cockpit, is there a part of you that would feel safer with two white men instead? When someone says \u201cdoctor\u201d or \u201cCEO,\u201d what are the first faces that come to mind? Anyone who says images of white men in power can\u2019t be normalized again forget how normal it still is, says Howard Ross, author of \u201cEveryday Bias.\u201d Ross saw this normalization in action when he delivered a recent speech on diversity at a meeting of health care leaders. About 75% of his audience was men. When audience members lined up to ask questions after his speech, he noticed an odd pattern. \u201cWho gets up to run the microphones? Six women. Not a single man among them,\u201d says Ross, who started Cook Ross Inc., a diversity consulting firm. \u201cThat\u2019s an optic that nobody was paying attention to. That reinforces the notion of who has access to power and who doesn\u2019t have access to power.\u201d The images of the people Trump surrounds himself with sends the same message, many say. Trump has assembled the least diverse Cabinet in 36 years. Most of his picks are rich, white men. It is the whitest cabinet since President Ronald Reagan\u2019s in 1981 and reverses a trend that accelerated under the Obama administration. Former President Barack Obama created the most \u201cdemographically diverse administration in history.\u201d White men don\u2019t just have more seats in Trump\u2019s Cabinet; they have more access to the President himself, according to a recent Politico article that tracked public reports of his interactions at the White House and other locations. And notice who normally flanks Trump when he signs documents in other White House photo ops. It\u2019s usually men who look just like him, says William Falk, editor of The Week magazine, who wrote about Trump\u2019s optics in an article entitled, \u201cToo Much Testosterone.\u201d Whites will not look at an all-white picture again and just take it for granted that it\u2019s normal. Jerald Podair, a historian at Lawrence University in Wisconsin \u201cEvery time President Trump signs a new executive order, he is surrounded by dozens of grinning aides, congressmen and industry CEOs, nearly all of them white, male and over 50,\u201d says Falk, who has joked about being a white man \u201cfor as long as I remember.\u201d  \u201cIs there a message there?\u201d The message is one of power: White men are back to running America and there\u2019s nothing you can do about it, says Gordon Coonfield, an authority on visual communication at Villanova University in Pennsylvania. He says the White House photo op with Trump and Republican leaders celebrating the passage of their health care bill wasn\u2019t accidental. It\u2019s \u201cstrategic.\u201d \u201cThese are not a bunch of bumbling old white guys who don\u2019t know better,\u201d says Coonfield. \u201cThey know exactly what they\u2019re doing. It\u2019s a certain staging of power. An image of a bunch of white guys seeking to undo health care coverage for millions of Americans sends a strong unambiguous message about whose interests are being represented and whose are not.\u201d The message that Trump and Republican leaders are sending subverts the rules of politics and PR: Appeal to the broadest demographic audience, says Andrew Blum, founder of AJB Communications, a public relations firm in New York City. \u201cIt was horrible optics, but they\u2019re getting away with it,\u201d Blum says of the White House photo op. \u201cIt\u2019s an amazing turn.\u201d There are those, though, who say that while Trump and the Republicans may be able to pause change, they won\u2019t be able to stop it. Most of America will reject any optics that evoke white male dominance, says Podair, the historian and author of \u201cCity of Dreams: Dodger Stadium and the Birth of Modern Los Angeles.\u201d He points to the narrowness of Trump\u2019s electoral victory as evidence. Almost 3 million more Americans voted against Trump than for him in the presidential election. Trump squeaked by only because of the peculiar nature of the Electoral College, he says. The corporate world, for example, is less forgiving than the political one, he says. Companies routinely craft images that appeal to the widest and most diverse audiences. \u201cThere are no Electoral Colleges in advertising,\u201d Podair says. \u201cIf Trump was a bar of soap, the advertising for Trump soap would not have worked \u2013 more people would have not bought his product.\u201d Others say the president who preceded Trump doomed any chance of rewinding the clock. Obama, the nation\u2019s first black president, made it normal to see people of color \u2013 as well as women, gays and lesbians \u2013 in positions of power, they say. It\u2019s strange to suddenly see so much white maleness in the White House, says Lisa Fritsch, an activist and author who lectures on diversity. \u201cObama definitely set a new level of decorum for the office and with that a higher standard for diversity and inclusion,\u201d Fritsch says. \u201cHe\u2019s made this White House seem peculiar and out of place in America.\u201d Others point to the wrath of social media.  People no longer passively accept images that exclude them. They go on the attack when they spot offensive images. \u201cAs certain groups got bigger and more educated, we felt like we had the right to complain,\u201d says Nancy A. Shenker, founder and CEO of theONswitch, a marketing firm. \u201cSocial media allowed for a certain sense of anonymity, and people who felt like they were discriminated against started to speak up.\u201d Any optics centered around \u201ca bunch of white guys\u201d won\u2019t resonate with contemporary Americans, says Nate Regier, an authority on organizational development and author of \u201cConflict Without Casualties.\u201d \u201cAmerica is diverse, period,\u201d he says. \u201cAnyone who denies it or acts as if it isn\u2019t true will be left behind economically, politically and socially.\u201d There was another recent photo, though, that challenges the idea that certain images are now unacceptable. After the city council in Charlottesville, Virginia, voted to remove a statue of Confederate Gen. Robert E. Lee from a downtown park, white nationalists mobilized. Richard Spencer, a white nationalist leader, led rallies in Charlottesville earlier this month protesting the pending removal of the statue. He tweeted a photo of himself with a torch. A column of torch-bearing white men chanted, \u201cYou will not replace us.\u201d Charlottesville Mayor Mike Signer saw Spencer\u2019s photo and took to Twitter to criticize the rally. He was attacked with a torrent of racist and anti-Semitic tweets including one that said, \u201cI smell Jew.\u201d Consider those optics: Photos of a group of white men holding torches at a nighttime rally; white men massing to protect the honor of another white man who fought to maintain white supremacy; ominous threats delivered publicly to those deemed belonging to a lesser group. This, too, was an image of white men that was supposed to be consigned to the past.",

            "article_content": "Stephanie Kemplin said Sen. Al Franken 'groped my right breast' during a photo op Kemplin estimated that the touching lasted anywhere from five to 10 seconds An Army veteran says Sen. Al Franken groped her in December 2003, telling CNN that while she was deployed in Kuwait, the Minnesota Democrat cupped her breast during a photo op. Stephanie Kemplin, 41, of Maineville, Ohio, is the fifth woman in two weeks to accuse Franken of inappropriate touching, and the second person to allege that such behavior took place while Franken was on a USO tour. Three of the five women have been identified by name. Kemplin said while she was stationed in the Middle East during the Iraq War, she met Franken \u2013 at the time, a comedian and writer \u2013 as he was visiting American troops with the USO. A longtime fan of \u201cSaturday Night Live,\u201d Kemplin got in line to take a photo with Franken. \u201cWhen he put his arm around me, he groped my right breast. He kept his hand all the way over on my breast,\u201d Kemplin said in an interview. \u201cI\u2019ve never had a man put their arm around me and then cup my breast. So he was holding my breast on the side.\u201d Kemplin repeatedly used the word \u201cembarrassed\u201d to describe her immediate reaction at the time. Al Franken on Capitol Hill says 'There are no magic words that I can say to regain your trust' \u201cI remember clenching up and how you just feel yourself flushed,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd I remember thinking \u2013 is he going to move his hand? Was it an accident? Was he going to move his hand? He never moved his hand.\u201d She added: \u201cIt was long enough that he should have known if it was an accident. I\u2019m very confident saying that.\u201d Kemplin estimated that the touching lasted anywhere from five to 10 seconds. She said she eventually turned her body to shift Franken\u2019s hand off her breast before the picture was taken. In a photo shared with CNN, Kemplin \u2013 who was 27 at the time and a military police officer \u2013 is smiling widely with the left side of her face pressed against Franken\u2019s right cheek. Franken\u2019s right arm is wrapped around Kemplin\u2019s back and his hand is on her side at chest-level, and does not appear to be on her breast in the photo. Looking back at the picture, Kemplin said she recalls feeling frozen and numb: \u201cI did not process it in those split seconds.\u201d A Franken spokesperson told CNN Wednesday night: \u201cAs Sen. Franken made clear this week, he takes thousands of photos and has met tens of thousands of people and he has never intentionally engaged in this kind of conduct. He remains fully committed to cooperating with the ethics investigation.\u201d In one of multiple lengthy phone calls with a CNN reporter this week, Kemplin repeatedly broke into sobs. \u201cI was in a war zone\u2026 You were on a USO tour \u2013 are you trying to boost the morale of the troops or are you trying to boost your own?\u201d she said. \u201cI just feel so sorry for that young girl in that picture.\u201d Kemplin said she did not say anything to Franken at the time. \u201cYou\u2019re immediately put on the spot. What are you going to do? What are you going to do? Your mind goes a mile a minute,\u201d she said. \u201cWho was I going to tell?\u201d Analysis | Franken wants you to know he's very sorry. Even if it's not clear what he's sorry for. She also doesn\u2019t recall telling any fellow soldiers about the incident afterwards because she felt ashamed and did not have peers she felt she could confide in. But she discussed it with multiple family members and relatives, including her sister, as well as an ex-boyfriend. CNN interviewed both. Amy Muddiman, Kemplin\u2019s older sister, said she remembers Kemplin being excited that Franken was coming to visit because she had grown up watching SNL. \u201cI just remember her telling me that he grabbed her breast and that she was so shocked about it,\u201d Muddiman said. \u201cMy sister is pretty bold and assertive and she said that she didn\u2019t know what to do.\u201d One of Kemplin\u2019s ex-boyfriends was also in the Army and he and Kemplin dated after the two of them returned to the United States. He asked not to be named to protect his privacy. He told CNN that while he did not remember all of the details of what Kemplin described of her encounter with Franken, she said \u201che went to put his arm around her and copped a feel.\u201d Kemplin\u2019s story bears striking resemblance to those of several other women who have accused Franken of groping in recent days. Lindsay Menz of Frisco, Texas, told CNN last week that Franken grabbed her buttocks while the two took a photo together at the Minnesota State Fair in 2010. The Huffington Post also reported that two women, whose identities were not revealed, said Franken touched their buttocks in 2007 and 2008. These stories came after Leeann Tweeden, morning news anchor on KABC radio in Los Angeles, revealed that Franken groped and forcibly kissed her during a USO tour in 2006. Kemplin said when she saw Tweeden\u2019s story on social media, she \u201cfelt like the rug was pulled out from underneath me\u201d because she had tried not to think about her run-in with Franken in years. Kemplin reached out to Tweeden two days after Tweeden went public with her story, and the two women spoke on the phone a few days later. In one of their subsequent conversations, Tweeden asked Kemplin if she could connect her with a CNN reporter. Over the past two weeks, Kemplin also wrote about her 2003 meeting with Franken on Facebook in two posts visible to her friends on the social network. One relative, whose name CNN is not using to protect the person\u2019s privacy, commented on Facebook that her husband \u201cremembers you telling him about (Franken) years ago.\u201d Kemplin, who now works as a federal contractor investigating Medicare fraud, is a registered Republican and said she voted for President Donald Trump in the 2016 election. One reason Kemplin said the Franken news has hit her especially hard in recent days is because she was the victim of sexual assault while serving overseas. She said she was assaulted by a specialist with whom she shared a tent in 2003, just months before her run-in with Franken. The details of the assault were shared with CNN but are not being disclosed at Kemplin\u2019s request. CNN has also reviewed Kemplin\u2019s military records. She was discharged honorably in 2008. Woman says Franken inappropriately touched her in 2010 Sean Chambers, the platoon sergeant who oversaw Kemplin while she was deployed in Kuwait, described Kemplin in an interview as a \u201cmodel soldier\u201d who was honest, friendly and quiet. Chambers said she confided in him about having been inappropriately touched by a member of their unit, though she did not divulge to him the full details at the time. An investigation was launched into Kemplin\u2019s complaint of \u201cindecent assault.\u201d According to documents viewed by CNN, Kemplin was eventually told that while the whole incident was \u201ctotally inappropriate behavior,\u201d the accused specialist was not guilty of \u201cindecent assault.\u201d In addition, she was told that she was \u201cresponsible\u201d for having allowed the male specialist to get close to her. \u201cI was really pissed off. It was not right,\u201d Chambers said. \u201cMy reaction was: when is it ever the victim\u2019s fault?\u201d He added: \u201cI believe Stephanie. I believe that something did happen. I\u2019ve seen sexual assault victims before in my line of work and the trauma that they face and there\u2019s no doubt in my mind that something happened.\u201d Re-living her encounter with Franken, Kemplin said, has brought up memories of that assault Kemplin struggled to re-acclimate when she came home from Iraq. Today she suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder and has trouble sleeping. One of her coping mechanisms since the war, Kemplin said, is to \u201cshut down\u201d and block out certain negative memories, particularly when she is feeling overwhelmed. She has described this in the past as a kind of selective \u201cmemory loss.\u201d Analysis | Can Al Franken survive? She said she is certain some people will question her story about Franken, because she is only choosing to speak out years later: \u201cNobody wants to believe anybody if you don\u2019t immediately stand up and say something.\u201d Franken has repeatedly apologized about behavior that he said \u201ccrossed a line\u201d for some women. The second-term senator has also said that he has taken thousands of photos with people over the years and that while he doesn\u2019t remember specific pictures or campaign events, any inappropriate behavior was unintentional. Franken faces a potential investigation under by the Senate Ethics Committee, and has said he will fully cooperate with the probe. In a news conference on Capitol Hill this week, CNN asked Franken why he was unable to answer the question of whether more women could come forward with allegations of sexual harassment. \u201cIf you had asked me two weeks ago, would any woman come forward with an allegation like this, I would have said no,\u201d Franken said. \u201cAnd so I cannot speculate. This has been a shock and it\u2019s been extremely humbling. I am embarrassed. I feel ashamed.\u201d CNN\u2019s Ryan Browne contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Maine decisively supported expanding Medicaid Virginia elected a staunch Obamacare supporter as governor Obamacare had a very good night on Tuesday after having a really rough year. While many Republicans on the federal and state level have sought to dismantle the health care law, voters in two states showed that coverage matters to them. Maine voters decisively supported expanding Medicaid, the first time the issue has been decided at the ballot box. And in Virginia, voters elected Democrat Ralph Northam, a staunch Obamacare supporter, as governor and sent more Democratic lawmakers to the statehouse, which is sure to restart the debate over expanding Medicaid there. 5 takeaways from the Democrats' big night Obamacare, officially the Affordable Care Act, gave states the option to expand Medicaid to cover low-income adults. The federal government picks up nearly all of the tab. With the effort to repeal Obamacare stalled in Congress, the battle has moved to the state level. Several states are looking to use waivers to loosen Obamacare\u2019s rules as much as possible, while also tailoring the program to their residents\u2019 needs. The federal government has signaled it will grant states more flexibility. Seema Verma, the administrator of the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid, said Tuesday her agency will approve applications to add work requirements for able-bodied Medicaid expansion enrollees. Tuesday\u2019s election results, however, show that Obamacare still has its defenders. In Maine, where Republican Gov. Paul LePage vetoed legislation to broaden Medicaid five times, expansion supporters collected enough signatures to put the question on the ballot. They argued that expansion would provide health insurance for up to 80,000 residents and inject $490 million in federal funds into the economy. Despite LePage\u2019s contention that expansion would cost taxpayers $315 million over the next five years and hurt the state\u2019s ability to care for the most vulnerable, the measure passed by 59% to 41%, according to results collected by the Portland Press Herald and Associated Press. Maine would become the 32nd state to broaden the program to cover low-income adults. However, expansion may not happen right away. LePage, who can\u2019t run next year because of term limits, blasted the election results as giving \u201cfree\u201d health care to working age, able-bodied adults. \u201cMy administration will not implement Medicaid expansion until it has been fully funded by the legislature at the levels [the Department of Health and Human Services] has calculated, and I will not support increasing taxes on Maine families, raiding the rainy day fund or reducing services to our elderly or disabled,\u201d LePage said. He cited the state\u2019s attempt to broaden Medicaid in 2002, which he said resulted in massive budget shortfalls and did not reduce the number of uninsured. Democrats sweep in Virginia, New Jersey Medicaid expansion advocates are likely to jump on the success in Maine to push ballot measures in other states. Even before Tuesday\u2019s results, one grassroots activist group, Reclaim Idaho, had already launched a petition campaign to put the issue on the ballot next November, according to an op-ed in the Idaho Statesman penned by the group\u2019s co-founder Luke Mayville in October. In Virginia, the health care influence was striking. Health care was the issue that mattered most to voters by an overwhelming margin. Some 39% said it was the most important issue, and they split in Northam\u2019s favor by a 77% to 23% margin. When Democratic Gov. Terry McAuliffe took office in 2014, he made Medicaid expansion one of his top priorities. However, he has been repeatedly blocked by the Republican majority in the state legislature. As of Wednesday afternoon, Democrats had gained 13 seats in the House of Delegates with several close races still to be decided that could determine control of the chamber. CNN\u2019s Z. Byron Wolf contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "The partisan trench warfare over Obamacare could soon be stilled by a fragile peace. Over the past few days, President  Donald Trump has declared the Affordable Care Act \u201cdead\u201d and promised a new vote soon on the most recently failed Republican health care bill, while simultaneously trying to sabotage the current law as a ploy to draw Democrats into negotiations \u2014 that have now tentatively succeeded in returning the debate to square one, with Trump endorsing a bipartisan proposal to fortify Obamacare, still very much alive, for a couple years. But even as Trump swerves from one tactic to another, the facts on the ground remain: very little has changed in the nearly seven months since the first GOP repeal effort flopped. Bipartisan senators reach small deal on health care On Friday, March 24 House Speaker Paul Ryan stood up at a press conference on Capitol Hill and conceded defeat. His Republican majority could not move legislation to undo the Affordable Care Act. \u201cObamacare is the law of the land,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s going to remain the law of the land until it\u2019s replaced. We did not have quite the votes to replace this law, and so, yeah, we\u2019re going to living with Obamacare for the foreseeable future.\u201d It\u2019s late October now and the state of play on health care remains fundamentally the same. Ryan\u2019s House passed a bill in May, but the Senate failed to follow suit. Republicans and Democrats have a deal, in principle, for a short-term fix \u2014 but only to patch a problem Trump himself created. Trump said he was on board with the tentative agreement forged by Republican Sen. Lamar Alexander and Democratic Sen. Patty Murray. Though he also said another repeal vote was in the offing. (And the day isn\u2019t done yet!) \u201cLamar has been working very, very hard with \u2026 his colleagues on the other side, and, Patty Murray is one of them in particular, and they\u2019re coming up, and they\u2019re fairly close to a short-term solution,\u201d Trump said during a press conference in the Rose Garden with Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras. \u201cThe solution will be for about a year or two years, and it will get us over this intermediate hump.\u201d Short-term fix or no, the President\u2019s obsession with harpooning Obamacare prevails. If his Republican allies are out for simple political profit, Trump is clearly in for more. It feels like vengeance \u2014 erasing the law, and with it his predecessor\u2019s name, at any cost. Also on Tuesday during the press conference, Trump again pronounced Obamacare \u201cvirtually dead.\u201d Before their meeting, he told reporters the law was on \u201cits final legs.\u201d The remarks echoed a wishful assessment he delivered during a televised Cabinet meeting on Monday. Trump: No such thing as Obamacare anymore \u201cObamacare is finished,\u201d he said then. \u201cIt\u2019s dead. It\u2019s gone. You shouldn\u2019t even mention it. It\u2019s gone. There is no such thing as Obamacare anymore.\u201d Reality disagrees. Obamacare is not, in any literal sense, dead or gone. Trump\u2019s effort to sabotage it has consisted of signing an order to cut off some key federal reimbursements and to undermine it by allowing some non-compliant insurance plans. He claimed, during the Cabinet meeting, that his decision was meant to provoke bipartisan talks. But those conversations predated his intervention. Their first round was cut off by Republicans as they rushed late last month to bring up for a vote doomed legislation from Sens. Lindsey Graham and Bill Cassidy. Rather than seek another tack, Trump continues to insist that Senate Republicans have the support to pass that bill. (They did not, and do not.) \u201cWe either have the votes or we\u2019re very close to having the votes,\u201d he said on Tuesday, \u201cand we will get the votes for having, really, the potential for having great health care in our country.\u201d Pretty to think so, but even if it were true, his next shot is a long ways off. Reconciliation rules, which would have allowed Senate Republicans to pass something with a simple majority have expired for now and the party is currently wired to focus on their tax plan, itself still a work in progress. But again, the whip count should be a secondary concern to the more fundamental issue \u2014 that all these years after Obama signed the ACA into law, the GOP still has no ideologically coherent or politically popular plan for undoing it. Trump during the Monday press conference burbled something about timelines. Obamacare, he noted, took more than a year to pass. But that was because, unlike these Republicans, the Obama-era Democrats \u2013 despite their own, even heavier majorities and ultimate decision to take a party line vote \u2013 held hearings, took a shot at serious negotiations with the GOP, and tried to go out into the country to sell the plan to voters. Those town hall meetings were a mess, sure, and there was plenty of internal debate among Democrats on Capitol Hill, but the purpose of the exercise was clear. Republicans, by contrast, never settled on an explanation of what exactly they were after apart from smashing the current law. Their sales job this year was a disaster from the get-go. And because Washington is a chatty town \u2013 on the record, off it, and in the spaces in between \u2013 and the President\u2019s inner monologue rarely remains so, the complications were laid bare over and over again. 9 things Donald Trump didn't tell the truth about on Monday Trump talked a bunch about Obamacare on Monday and Tuesday, but, again, never quite articulated a path forward \u2013 apart from his familiar, inscrutable pledge to \u201cget health care that\u2019s much more affordable and much better healthcare.\u201d In May, he promised, \u201cOur healthcare will soon be great.\u201d Rewind to the days after his election, in November of last year, and the song was the same: \u201cIt\u2019ll be great healthcare for much less money,\u201d he said in a 60 Minutes interview. \u201cSo it\u2019ll be better healthcare, much better, for less money. Not a bad combination.\u201d His only nod to big-ticket action that could rope in Democrats came during a Monday riff that might\u2019ve put a smile on, of all people, Sen. Bernie Sanders\u2019 face. On the question of prescription drug prices, Trump said, \u201cYou go to England, you go to various places, Canada, you go to many, many countries, and the same exact pill from the same company, the same box, same everything is a tiny fraction of what it costs in the United States.\u201d Both the UK and Canada use forms of socialized medicine. This gives their governments better negotiating positions and helps to drive down drug costs. Maybe Trump, in his desperation to wipe Obama\u2019s name off the books, would consider a compromise and sign on to Sanders\u2019 \u201cMedicare for all\u201d bill? Trump was for Steve Bannon before he was against him Until then, expect a lot of rhetoric, some green shoots of compromise (like we\u2019ve seen Tuesday) and then more work to scythe down the law as a whole. Former Trump aide Steve Bannon issued the rallying cry \u2013 and probably the closest thing to an honest assessment of where this goes from here \u2013 over the weekend at the Values Voter Summit in Washington. \u201cNot gonna make the (cost-sharing reduction) payments,\u201d he said, \u201cgonna blow (Obamacare) up, gonna blow those exchanges up, right?\u201d Maybe, maybe not. The deal in Senate between Murray and Alexander is hardly done and dusted. Paul Ryan could squash it in the House. Beyond that, what follows is as much a mystery as it was on the day Trump took office.",

            "article_content": "Former VP Joe Biden has kicked up speculation with his travel schedule Montana Gov. Steve Bullock has a colorful metaphor for a 'Medicare for all' litmus test Our weekly roundup of the news, notes and chatter about the prospects for the next Democratic presidential race: What does a California Senate primary in 2018 have to do with a Democratic presidential race in 2020? Potentially a lot. State Senate leader Kevin de Le\u00f3n is the first Democrat to decide to run against Sen. Dianne Feinstein. Billionaire environmentalist and megadonor Tom Steyer is considering doing it too. While it\u2019s too soon to know if they are viable, what\u2019s already clear is that Feinstein \u2013 who\u2019s been criticized for not being aggressive enough against President Donald Trump \u2013 is facing a real challenge from the left. This could pit her against many of the progressives who backed Sen. Bernie Sanders\u2019 2016 campaign. And though Sanders himself is largely staying out of Democratic primaries, figures popular with the \u201cBerniecrat\u201d crowd, including California Rep. Ro Khanna, are lining up against Feinstein. Both Sen. Kamala Harris and Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti are strongly supporting Feinstein. If she ends up in serious jeopardy, that support could cause both of them problems with progressives. Out-of-state Democratic 2020 prospects, meanwhile, could see wading into a nationalized, marquee contest as a way to elevate their own profile ahead of a presidential race in which California is now slotted early on the calendar, right after Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina. WARREN\u2019S BIG FUNDRAISING HAUL: Here\u2019s the first number to consider when weighing Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren\u2019s future: $13 million. It\u2019s how much she has in the bank after a $3 million third quarter fundraising haul, headed into a re-election campaign where, as of now, she doesn\u2019t have a serious challenger. \u2013 Warren heads to Ohio next Friday for a joint fundraiser with Sen. Sherrod Brown in Cleveland. Also attending the Butcher & the Brewer lunch will be Reps. Marcy Kaptur and Joe Kennedy. MURPHY\u2019S PRESENT-TENSE DENIAL: Connecticut Sen. Chris Murphy was asked twice this week, by CBS and then by ABC, whether he is considering a run for president in 2020. Both times, Murphy went with a familiar dodge: the present-tense denial, focused on what he\u2019s doing right now. \u201cI am thinking about one thing and one thing only right now, and that is my re-election in 2018,\u201d he told ABC. To CBS, he said, \u201cI am not running for president. I am running for re-election to the Senate.\u201d Murphy later added: \u201cHere you go, I will rule it out for you. I\u2019m running for re-election.\u201d JOE BIDEN\u2019S BIPARTISAN WEEK: Former Vice President Joe Biden has been kicking up 2020 speculation with his aggressive political travel schedule, including stops for 2017 gubernatorial candidates on Thursday for Phil Murphy in New Jersey and on Saturday for Ralph Northam in Virginia \u2013 make sure you don\u2019t miss our new story on that. But next week, he\u2019ll be crossing the aisle twice. Biden is set to award Arizona Sen. John McCain with the National Constitution Center\u2019s Liberty Medal on Monday in Philadelphia. The next day, he\u2019ll join Ohio Gov. John Kasich for a discussion about bipartisanship in Delaware. Both Republicans have been sharp critics of President Donald Trump and have called for more bipartisan cooperation \u2013 making them natural allies for Biden\u2019s brand of politics. \u2013 Biden will be honored at the United Nations Day Humanitarian Awards Gala Dinner in New York on November 3. GILLIBRAND ON DC: Here\u2019s what New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand told Vogue in the magazine\u2019s latest feature on her: \u201cIt\u2019s a heavy feeling being in Washington. There are so many important issues at risk. You\u2019re in a fighting stance every day. Because the stuff that comes over Twitter is so horrible. The attack on the transgender troops: disgusting, disgraceful, outrageous. It\u2019s just endless. And then you try to do your day job of finding good bipartisan work across the aisle. You\u2019re doing both all the time. I guess I would describe it as intense. Everything is very intense.\u201d \u2013 An interesting quote about Gillibrand\u2019s 2020 prospects that Vogue included from New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, another potential 2020 candidate: \u201cI have no idea what she wants, but would she be an amazing president? Absolutely. I say it all the time: You can\u2019t lead the people if you don\u2019t love the people \u2013 and she will go above and beyond for folks. I don\u2019t know if America could hope for a president that cares and loves and works and fights for them more than she would.\u201d CUOMO\u2019S WEINSTEIN REVERSAL: New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo on Thursday reversed his initial decision to give only $50,000 of the $111,400 that Harvey Weinstein had donated to his campaigns, saying he will give away all of it \u2013 even the money Cuomo had initially said was for previous races and had already been spent. DELANEY IN IOWA: Maryland Rep. John Delaney, the only declared 2020 candidate, is in Iowa for a three-day, 10-event swing starting Saturday. It includes the Third District Hall of Fame Dinner in Des Moines on Saturday night, the Central Iowa Democrats\u2019 Fall Barbecue in Ames on Sunday and meet-and-greets in Charles City, Saint Ansgar, Mason City, Hampton and Fort Dodge on Monday. BULLOCK ON PURITY TESTS: Politico\u2019s Gabe Debenedetti went to Montana to profile Gov. Steve Bullock. Among the interesting tidbits is Bullock on Sen. Bernie Sanders\u2019 \u201cMedicare for all\u201d single-payer proposal. \u201cI think of the late \u201980s, when (former congressman) Mo Udall said getting Democrats together is like organizing a firing squad in a circle,\u201d he said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to make a litmus test on that in August of 2017? I think, in some ways, Democrats are repeating their same mistakes.\u201d \u2013 Sunday, October 15: The Central Iowa Democrats\u2019 Fall Barbecue features Hawaii Rep. Tulsi Gabbard and Maryland Rep. John Delaney. It starts at 12:30 p.m. CT. \u2013 Monday, October 16: Former Vice President Joe Biden awards Arizona Sen. John McCain the National Constitution Center\u2019s Liberty Medal. The ceremony is at 7 p.m. ET on Independence Mall. \u2013 Tuesday, October 17: Joe Biden and Ohio Gov. John Kasich, a Republican, hold a joint discussion about bipartisanship at the University of Delaware, starting at 1 p.m. ET. \u2013 Thursday, October 19: Former President Barack Obama makes his first appearance on the campaign trail since leaving office, campaigning in Richmond with Virginia gubernatorial candidate Ralph Northam. \u2013 Friday, October 20: Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren headlines a joint fundraiser with Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown in Cleveland. The 11:30 a.m. event\u2019s cheapest tickets are $100 per person. To win the 2020 race, Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti would have to do something no one\u2019s done before. \u2026 The headliner of the Iowa Democratic Party\u2019s Fall Gala on November 27 is Alec Baldwin. (Yes, really. We\u2019re told he\u2019s a hot ticket for state parties.) \u2026 In Des Moines for a New Democracy event Friday on winning back Midwestern voters: Jason Kander and John Delaney.

            "article_content": "California state Senate president Kevin de Le\u00f3n, 50, represents Los Angeles He is seen as a leading Latino voice in Democratic politics Progressive group plans on launching new candidate next week California Democratic state Senate president Kevin de Le\u00f3n intends to enter California\u2019s 2018 Senate race against Sen. Dianne Feinstein, three sources with knowledge of his plans say. De Le\u00f3n has begun calling labor leaders and elected officials to inform them of his plans, the sources said, and is expected to soon announce his campaign against Feinstein, a giant of California Democratic politics who has held the office since 1992. The 50-year-old de Le\u00f3n, who represents Los Angeles and is seen as a leading Latino voice in Democratic politics, is likely to campaign aggressively against President Donald Trump. He began signaling he could oppose Feinstein in late August, after she said Trump could \u201cbe a good president\u201d and that he \u201ccan learn and change.\u201d Feinstein later clarified that she is \u201cunder no illusion that it\u2019s likely to happen and will continue to oppose his policies.\u201d Dianne Feinstein running for reelection next year in face of liberal angst He will enter the race after a state legislative session in which California lawmakers pushed legislation targeted at Trump \u2013 making California a \u201csanctuary state,\u201d sought to force Trump to release his tax returns by making it a requirement to appear on the state\u2019s ballots as a presidential candidate, and passed a resolution urging Trump \u201cto publicly apologize to all Americans for his racist and bigoted behavior.\u201d \u201cCalifornia\u2019s progressive and labor movement is salivating for new blood and fresh ideas in Washington, and Kevin de Le\u00f3n is the embodiment of the California resistance and the future of the Democratic Party,\u201d said California Democratic strategist Dave Jacobson. De Le\u00f3n likely won\u2019t be the only Feinstein challenger. Tom Steyer, the billionaire environmentalist and single largest Democratic donor, is \u201cvery much looking at the Senate race,\u201d a source close to him said. Steyer, who is in Washington this week, issued a letter Wednesday challenging Democratic candidates to call for Trump\u2019s impeachment. \u201cThis is no time for \u2018patience\u2019 \u2013 Donald Trump is not fit for office. It is clear for all to see that there is zero reason to believe \u2018he can be a good president,\u2019\u201d Steyer said in the first line of his letter. With criticism of Feinstein mostly coming from the left, Democratic candidates seeking to replace her will first have to win over the party\u2019s increasingly powerful progressive wing. Because there is no party primary in California \u2013 the top two overall vote-getters in the June \u201cjungle primary\u201d advance to the general election, no matter their affiliation \u2013 the race will be fought on two planes. Feinstein figures to win the backing of the party establishment, and will almost surely advance past the June vote to the November election. That means her challengers will effectively be running their own mini-race, against each other, for the chance to take her on head-to-head. The roster of high-profile contenders is expected to expand beyond de Le\u00f3n. The Justice Democrats, an increasingly influential progressive grassroots group, does not plan to back him \u201cWe are going to launch another candidate, next week \u2013 someone that\u2019s not announced at all yet,\u201d said Corbin Trent, the Justice Democrats communications director. \u201cIt\u2019s going to be her,\u201d Trent said \u2013 not naming names. \u201cWe\u2019re certainly not going to try to whittle away at the already shameful 17% representation women have in the the House and Senate.\u201d There is also the prospect of Joe Sanberg, the wealthy investor and activist, who is now seriously considering a run. He paid for and launched a digital media buy last month, along with a website to introduce himself, and his economic plan, to voters. Sanberg\u2019s decision could be influenced by de Le\u00f3n\u2019s early performance. But Sanberg adviser Rebecca Katz, a veteran progressive operative, speaking Thursday took aim at the incumbent \u2013 and the President. \u201cDianne Feinstein is one of the most conservative senators in the Democratic caucus,\u201d she said. \u201cAnd in the age of Trump a state as progressive as California deserves the most progressive senators.\u201d De Le\u00f3n will enter the contest with a significant recent boost to his progressive bona fides. As state Senate president, he passed a bill out of his chamber that would lay the groundwork for a single payer health care plan in California. That legislation, SB562, was subsequently tabled by state assembly speaker Anthony Rendon, setting off a fierce round of intra-party recriminations. \u201cOur relationship with de Le\u00f3n has been extremely positive. He\u2019s taken a lot of heat (for moving the single payer bill), as the cowardly Democrats in the assembly try to hide,\u201d said RoseAnn DeMoro, executive director of National Nurses United, which lobbied hard for the bill. \u201cDe Le\u00f3n stood up.\u201d The nurses\u2019 union has been approached by potential candidates but has not yet not made a decision on who it might endorse in the race. DeMoro, a fiery critic of Democratic establishment figures and staunch supporter and ally of Sen. Bernie Sanders, expressed her personal respect for Feinstein, but is concerned the senator\u2019s re-election bid is a \u201cploy\u201d to clear the way for a more moderate future successor, like Democratic Rep. Adam Schiff. \u201cI hate that she\u2019s put us in this position because I don\u2019t want to disrespect her history and that\u2019s the problem that we\u2019ve got here,\u201d DeMoro said. \u201cIt\u2019s not her powerful position, and she is powerful, but we need someone who reflects today\u2019s values as a leader. It\u2019s not the age thing, it\u2019s the political thing. I don\u2019t think she\u2019s in this for the long haul.\u201d As for Sanders, there is no indication as yet that he is planning to engage in the race. He has mostly stayed clear of the Democratic Party\u2019s most pitched battles, instead focusing on his \u201cMedicare for all\u201d push and support for progressive candidates in local races. He endorsed Randall Woodfin, who was elected mayor of Birmingham, Alabama \u2013 defeating an incumbent Democrat \u2013 earlier this month. And the political organization spun out of his 2016 campaign, Our Revolution, is finding success down the ballot too, with a series of recent endorsements, from Birmingham to New York, where Christine Pellegrino, a Democrat, shocked observers last spring by defeating a Republican in a state assembly race.

            "article_content": "Reid was part of a meeting between Menendez and HHS officials about a Medicare dispute The meeting is part of the bribery case against the New Jersey Democrat The trial ended its fifth week Wednesday Prosecutors do not plan to call former Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid as a witness in their case against New Jersey Democratic Sen. Bob Menendez, a source familiar with the matter tells CNN. Former HHS secretary Sebelius describes 'unusual' meeting with Sen. Menendez The trial against Menendez ended its fifth week Wednesday as a former Reid aide testified about a 2012 meeting between Menendez, Reid and other federal officials that is a key part of the bribery case against the New Jersey senator. Kate Leone, a former Reid aide, told jurors there was \u201cconfusion\u201d about the purpose of the meeting. At the same time, there were certain \u201cground rules\u201d that prohibited Menendez from specifically raising his friend\u2019s \u2013 Dr. Salomon Melgen \u2013 ongoing multimillion-dollar dispute with Medicare in the meeting. Prosecutors have framed the 2012 meeting as an effort by Menendez to advocate on behalf of Melgen, who was facing an $8.9 million repayment demand from the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services over his billing practice for the eye drug, Lucentis. Prosecutors say Menendez accepted political donations and other perks from Melgen in exchange for the senator\u2019s assistance with the dispute \u2013 allegations the two men deny. Department of Health and Human Services officials \u201cwere very clear\u201d that the issue of Melgen\u2019s case could not be discussed in the meeting with Reid, Menendez, then-HHS Secretary Kathleen Sebelius and other staffers, and that the conversation instead focused more generally on the underlying health care policy behind the dispute, Leone said. While prosecutors don\u2019t plan to call Reid, it remains to be seen if the defense team will call him in their case. Meet the judicial renegade overseeing Sen. Menendez's trial Federal regulations at the time approved Lucentis for \u201csingle-use\u201d only, meaning that each vial should only be used for a single patient, but the doctor \u201cmulti-dosed\u201d the drug, using the \u201coverfill\u201d from the vials to treat up to three patients, and then billed Medicare three times, as if a separate vial was purchased for each dose. Leone testified that Reid arranged the August 2012 meeting with Menendez to \u201cmake sure there was a full airing of the Sen. Menendez\u2019s concerns\u201d regarding the issues surrounding Melgen\u2019s overbilling dispute, since the senator felt CMS and HHS had \u201cnot been responsive enough\u201d to his inquiries. Leone further explained to jurors that Menendez \u201cexpressed concern\u201d about what he viewed as a \u201cinconsistency\u201d in the CMS\u2019 guidance on multi-dosing and he wanted it \u201cclarified\u201d in favor of allowing multi-dosing, but only prospectively. Menendez\u2019s alleged advocacy on behalf of Melgen regarding the CMS dispute is a major element of the government\u2019s corruption case, since the government must prove the senator took some \u201cofficial act\u201d in exchange for something of value under federal bribery laws. Later Wednesday afternoon, prosecutors sought to tie Menendez\u2019s advocacy on the CMS dispute with Melgen\u2019s political donations. Specifically, witnesses testified about donations made by Melgen to political campaigns in 2012. Melgen was on the hosting committee for a June 2012 fundraiser for Menendez\u2019s senate race, a former fundraiser testified. And Melgen donated a total of $600,000, earmarked for the state of New Jersey, to a Democratic super PAC later that year, according to another fundraiser. One of the checks Melgen wrote was in October 2012, two months after the August meeting in Reid\u2019s office. On cross-examination, witnesses said that nothing about these donations was concealed or hidden, and that the super PAC never coordinated with Menendez\u2019s campaign, as required under federal election law. The trial will resume next Tuesday.",

Luther Strange in Alabama He's not the first politician to take a high-profile public horseback ride Some have compared elections to horse races \u2013 and Alabama Senate Republican primary candidate Roy Moore is literally galloping to the finish line of his runoff campaign. The GOP candidate and his wife arrived to their polling place in Gallant, Alabama, Tuesday on horseback. Moore, sporting a cowboy hat and boots, rode a horse named Sassy, while his wife Kayla arrived on a horse named Sundance, according to Getty. Here's everything you need to know about the Alabama Senate race Moore faces off against Sen. Luther Strange in the special election for Attorney General Jeff Sessions\u2019 former seat in the US Senate. Strange currently holds the seat after being appointed by then-Gov. Robert Bentley to finish out Sessions\u2019 term; he has the backing of President Donald Trump and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. Moore is seen as the anti-establishment candidate and has been a lightning rod for controversy. He was removed from his state Supreme Court job twice and has a long history of making highly contentious comments about race and sexual orientation. In 2015, he shared a video promoting the conspiracy theory that former President Barack Obama is a Muslim. Moore has been endorsed by former White House chief strategist Steve Bannon and former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin. A post shared by CNN Politics (@cnnpolitics) According to the Belleville News-Democrat, Moore says it is a tradition for him to ride a horse to vote. If elected, he wouldn\u2019t be the only politician to enjoy horseback riding. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke rode a horse to his first day of work at the agency in March. Vice President Mike Pence enjoyed a horseback ride in Rock Creek Park with Sen. Roy Blunt and Medicare Administrator Seema Verma in July.",

Bernie Sanders has unveiled his own 'Medicare for all' proposal CNN will host a town hall with Republican Sens. Lindsey Graham and Bill Cassidy, who will be debating health care with Sens. Bernie Sanders and Amy Klobuchar on Monday, September 25 at 9 p.m. ET. CNN anchor Jake Tapper and chief political correspondent Dana Bash will moderate the 90-minute live event from Washington. Graham and Cassidy are the namesake sponsors of a last-ditch effort to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act ahead of an end-of-the-month deadline, while Sanders introduced a new \u201cMedicare for all\u201d health care bill with a third of the Senate Democratic caucus by his side. According to the chamber\u2019s parliamentarian, senators only have until the end of the month to pass a bill with just 51 votes under the procedure known as reconciliation, and the Senate\u2019s latest push isn\u2019t all that different than the one that ultimately resulted in a health care bill being passed in the House. As of Thursday, it\u2019s not clear whether there are enough Republican votes to advance the Graham-Cassidy proposal, a health care bill that was released a week ago and would repeal the individual and employer mandates and turn the federal funding for Medicaid expansion and the subsidies into a block grant program.

Bernie Sanders rolled out his 'Medicare for all' plan earlier this week The Congressional Black Caucus holds its legislative conference next week Our weekly roundup of the news, notes and chatter about the prospects for the next Democratic presidential race: How seismic a shake-up would California deliver to the 2020 Democratic race if \u2013 in a move lawmakers could approve Friday \u2013 it shifts its primary to the first Tuesday in March, slotting the state in right after the traditional first four contests? \u201cVery big deal,\u201d one veteran Democratic strategist said. \u201cIt\u2019s huge,\u201d another said. \u201cOn every measure \u2013 time, travel, money, media \u2013 it seems to me that the early four would go through the traditional motions but the action would be out West,\u201d said a Democratic strategist in one of those early states of Iowa, New Hampshire, Nevada and South Carolina. So which prospective candidates would benefit from the move? Another Democratic operative said: \u201cThe more (demographically) representative states that go earlier make it harder for a niche candidate to win, and the bigger states that go earlier make it harder for a candidate with no national profile to raise money to win. This is good news for everyone from Joe Biden to Kamala Harris and bad news for everyone from Bernie Sanders to Tim Ryan.\u201d Then, there\u2019s the possibility that an earlier California primary could trigger other state moves. Oregon\u2019s secretary of state on Thursday called for its contest to be moved to March, while Washington\u2019s state legislature has considered the same move. The South\u2019s so-called SEC primary, meanwhile, might need to be moved back a week. The primary move is part of California lawmakers\u2019 long list of items to give final votes before wrapping up their session late Friday night. Then, it\u2019d head to Gov. Jerry Brown, a two-time presidential candidate himself for a final sign-off or veto. One word of caution: Important bills are sometimes victims of the end-of-session crush, with too many last-minute deals to strike and votes to cast and too little time \u2014 so this might not all wrap up neatly Friday night. SANDERS\u2019 SINGLE-PAYER ROLLOUT: Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders finally unveiled his long-awaited single-payer \u201cMedicare for all\u201d bill this week \u2013 with 16 Democratic co-sponsors. Most of the 2020 contenders are on the list. One Democratic senator up for re-election in a Trump state \u2014 Wisconsin Sen. Tammy Baldwin \u2013 is, too. This positions Sanders as a thought leader on what will be one of the central domestic policy debates of the next presidential race. \u2014 The two most interesting names who did not co-sponsor the bill: Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown, who\u2019s up for re-election, and Connecticut Sen. Chris Murphy, who is working on a bill that would let all Americans buy into Medicare. Murphy also said single-payer \u201cshould not be a litmus test for Democrats.\u201d BIDEN TAKES ON TRUMP: In an op-ed from The New York Times on Thursday, former Vice President Joe Biden blasted President Donald Trump, accusing him of undercutting American values and diminishing the United States\u2019 standing in the world. \u201cMr. Trump\u2019s shameful defense of the white nationalists and neo-Nazis who unleashed hatred and violence in Charlottesville, Virginia, further abnegated America\u2019s moral leadership. Not since the Jim Crow era has an American president so misunderstood and misrepresented our values,\u201d Biden wrote. He called Trump\u2019s decision to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program \u201can unnecessary cruelty that further undermines America\u2019s standing in the world.\u201d HARRIS BACKS FEINSTEIN FOR RE-ELECTION: California Sen. Kamala Harris backed her in-state colleague Sen. Dianne Feinstein, saying she\u2019s with Feinstein \u201c100%\u201d and \u201cwill be front and center supporting her\u201d if she runs for re-election in 2018. This comes despite mounting frustration on the left with what some progressive activists see as her willingness to work with Trump and her failure to block Trump judicial nominees \u2013 compounded by Feinstein\u2019s criticism of single-payer as unfeasible this week. Harris praised Feinstein to Politico\u2019s Carla Marinucci for championing the 1990s assault weapons ban and her role in exposing the CIA\u2019s detention and interrogation program. \u201cShe and I are on the intelligence committee together \u2026 and she is forceful and clear-thinking,\u201d Harris said. \u201cAnd the way I see her conduct herself \u2026 definitely reflects California\u2019s values. She fights in those committee hearings and behind closed doors.\u201d A separate, but also interesting note: Harris is now more popular than Feinstein in California. MERKLEY\u2019S SIX-EVENT, 40-HOUR IOWA WHIRLWIND: Oregon Sen. Jeff Merkley \u2013 progressive activist organizations\u2019 glue guy in the Senate \u2013 was all over the place in Iowa last weekend. Per The Des Moines Register\u2019s Jason Noble: \u201cImmediately upon arriving Saturday night, he attended a reception thrown by the Iowa Democratic Party. After the (Progress Iowa) corn feed, he met with Polk County Democratic activists and some of Sanders\u2019s top supporters from the 2016 presidential campaign at separate events. \u2026 On Monday, he \u2026 (chatted) with Drake University students at a meeting organized by the Harkin Institute for Public Policy and Citizen Engagement, followed by a get-together with business leaders at the Greater Des Moines Partnership. That\u2019s six events in about 40 hours.\u201d AUMF AND STRANGE ALLIES: Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul, a Republican, pushed unsuccessfully for the Senate to repeal the early-2000s war authorizations allowing the United States to fight terrorism across the globe. (Paul\u2019s argument: It\u2019s time for a new, updated authorization.) The effort failed \u2014 but the entire lineup of Democratic 2020 prospects voted with Paul. \u2014 Saturday, September 16: The Iowa Faith & Freedom Coalition Fall Banquet in Des Moines features Republican Sens.

            "article_content": "Sen. Bernie Sanders introduced his \u201cMedicare for All\u201d bill Wednesday, marking the latest chapter in a national conversation about the government\u2019s role in health care. Here\u2019s a brief look back at the history of health care legislation, starting with the passage of Medicare and Medicaid, which were themselves the subject of long national debates. On July 30, 1965, President Lyndon B. Johnson signed the Social Security Amendments of 1965 into law. The landmark legislation established the Medicare program, which provided hospital insurance and medical assistance to Americans over the age of 65. It also created the program that would come to be known as Medicaid, giving medical assistance to those deemed unable to afford insurance. It was a pivotal moment. \u201cNo longer will older Americans be denied the healing miracle of modern medicine. No longer will illness crush and destroy the savings that they have so carefully put away over a lifetime so that they might enjoy dignity in their later years. No longer will young families see their own incomes, and their own hopes, eaten away simply because they are carrying out their deep moral obligations to their parents, and to their uncles, and their aunts,\u201d Johnson said at the bill signing event in Independence, Missouri. The passage of the legislation was far from easy. \u201cUntil then there had only been unsuccessful efforts to create robust national health insurance programs,\u201d said Julian Zelizer, a Princeton history professor and CNN contributor who wrote The Fierce Urgency of Now: Lyndon Johnson, Congress, and the Battle for the Great Society. Presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt and Harry S. Truman had both pushed for forms of national health insurance and failed. President John F. Kennedy advocated for Medicare in 1962 and 1963, and Johnson took up the mantle following Kennedy\u2019s assassination, Zelizer said. Advocates of the plans were faced with fierce opposition. \u201cDoctors mounted a fierce lobbying blitz against this bill unlike almost anything that has taken place until that time. Lobbying in local communities, threatening members of Congress that if it passed they would try to get them out of office,\u201d Zelizer said. \u201cThe Southern Democrats who controlled all of the committees back then, they didn\u2019t want this bill either. So it was a pretty brutal fight and it lasted many, many years. It took many tries until this finally happened.\u201d Inside Bernie Sanders' new 'Medicare for all' bill The 1964 elections, however, saw a shifting political tide. Johnson was elected over Barry Goldwater, a Medicare opponent, and Democrats gained control of Congress. Arkansas Democrat Wilbur Mills, once a staunch opponent of the Medicare bill, switched his position. \u201cOnce he flipped, the whole politics of the issue changed,\u201d Zelizer noted. With these conditions in place, the bill passed 70-24 in the Senate and 307-116 in the House. The impact of Medicare\u2019s passage and implementation had profound effects, both for individuals at the time and on the future of health care legislation in the US. \u201cIt was a watershed,\u201d Zelizer said. \u201cMost important, you had a national health insurance program where that had been politically impossible, now the idea that the federal government would play a big role in health care was the law of the land.\u201d \u201cThe program itself has major impact early on. Medicare, within a few years, is covering huge parts the population, many Americans come to expect Medicare benefits as a right and they don\u2019t see this even as some kind of dramatic government program, it\u2019s just part of the health care system. Doctors start to depend on it by the late \u201960s, hospitals start to depend on this money,\u201d he continued. \u201cI\u2019d say within five years it\u2019s totally transformed both the role of government in health care, but even what health care meant for most people receiving the benefits.\u201d There were a number of efforts to expand federal health care in the subsequent years, perhaps the most notable of which was the so-called Clinton health care plan. President Bill Clinton drafted a task force, chaired by first lady Hillary Clinton, to develop a universal health care proposal shortly after his first inauguration in 1992. In 1993, Hillary Clinton testified before the House Committee on Ways and Means and several other congressional committees on behalf of the proposal. That same year, the Health Security Act was introduced to Congress. However, their reform efforts faced vocal opposition and the legislation failed to come to a floor vote. The legislation failed to come to a floor vote and Congress did not take further action on it past 1994. In December 2003, President George W. Bush signed into law the largest of expansion of Medicare since its creation. The $400 billion Medicare Prescription Drug Modernization Act \u2013 \u201cMedicare Part D\u201d \u2013 aimed to help Medicare recipients afford their prescription drugs. The law granted billions in subsidies to insurance companies and health maintenance organizations, and it took the first step toward allowing private plans to compete with Medicare. It also allowed the importation of drugs from Canada if the FDA has approved the medications. \u201cOur nation has made a promise, a solemn promise, to America\u2019s seniors,\u201d Bush said at the bill signing. \u201cWe have pledged to help our citizens find affordable medical care in the later years of life.\u201d \u201cThese reforms are the act of a vibrant and compassionate government,\u201d Bush said. Critics of the bill said it forced seniors into high-priced plans at the benefit of insurance and drug companies. It passed the Senate 54-44 in November 2003 \u2013 11 Democrats voted in favor of the legislation and nine Republicans voted against. The next successful effort, therefore, was the passage of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act \u2013 also known as the Affordable Care Act or Obamacare \u2013 in 2010. It required that Americans either obtain insurance or pay a fine, included subsidies to help people pay for insurance and greatly expanded Medicaid in most states. It also put new rules in place to keep insurance companies from discriminating against people based on pre-existing conditions and required them to offer certain essential benefits. It did not, however, despite fierce lobbying from some Democrats, include a public health insurance option for those not eligible for Medicare or Medicaid. Health care reform was a key theme of the 2008 election. President Barack Obama declared a need to reform health care in his first address to a joint session of Congress in February 2009. \u201cWe can no longer afford to put health care reform on hold,\u201d he said. \u201cI suffer no illusions that this will be an easy process. It will be hard. But I also know that nearly a century after Teddy Roosevelt first called for reform, the cost of our health care has weighed down our economy and the conscience of our nation long enough. So let there be no doubt: health care reform cannot wait, it must not wait, and it will not wait another year.\u201d Congressional proponents of the Obamacare legislation faced heckling and strong opposition from conservatives and members of the newly formed Tea Party movement in their home districts. After months of contentious legislative back and forth, the bill passed the Senate 60-39 in December 2009 and the House in March 2010 with support only from Democrats. The Senate used reconciliation to pass the House\u2019s changes after losing their super majority following Democratic Sen. Ted Kennedy\u2019s death and the election of Republican Sen. Scott Brown to his seat. Obama signed the bill into law in March 2010. The ACA remains in effect following a Supreme Court challenge against the individual mandate portion of the bill and failed Republican repeal and replace efforts earlier this year. Sanders\u2019 introduction of his bill today follows a previous effort in 2013. He was alone in his attempt then, but now has nearly a third of the Senate Democratic caucus backing him \u2013 including a number of 2020 prospects. While most Democrats work toward an even more liberal health care system like the one supported by Sanders, most Republicans continue to work toward repealing the ACA. Although Sanders\u2019 measure will certainly fail in the Republican-controlled Senate, Zelizer noted that historical precedents could someday work in favor of a single-payer health care system. \u201cI think the Medicare and Medicaid stories show that programs start as incredibly controversial and are seen as way off the political spectrum of what\u2019s possible can actually become very familiar to people and they could become the law of the land,\u201d he said.",

            "article_content": "When Bernie Sanders proposed single-payer health insurance in the 2016 Democratic primary race, the Democratic establishment rolled its collective eyes. The idea, which had been kicking around liberal circles for decades, was seen as a nonstarter for any serious candidate because of the expected massive price tag of the government paying for health coverage for everyone. And the fact that such a massive cost would almost certainly be paid for by significant tax hikes. Hillary Clinton suggested the idea was a pipe dream that could undermine her work to shore up the Affordable Care Act. \u201cPeople who have health emergencies can\u2019t wait for us to have a theoretical debate about some better idea that will never, ever come to pass,\u201d she said in January 2016. Boy, have things changed! On Tuesday, New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand became the fifth Democratic presidential aspirant to announce support for Sanders\u2019 \u201cMedicare For All\u201d legislation. Gillibrand joins Sens. Kamala Harris (California), Cory Booker (New Jersey), Jeff Merkley (Oregon) and Elizabeth Warren (Massachusetts) as co-sponsors for Sanders\u2019 legislation. (Sanders will formally unveil the legislation today.) What that means is that with the notable exception of former Vice President Joe Biden, every top tier(ish) 2020 Democrat is now on board with a policy proposal that Clinton said less than two years ago would \u201cnever, ever come to pass.\u201d  In an op-ed published Wednesday morning in The New York Times, Sanders wrote about the uniqueness of this moment: \u201cThis is a pivotal moment in American history. Do we, as a nation, join the rest of the industrialized world and guarantee comprehensive health care to every person as a human right? Or do we maintain a system that is enormously expensive, wasteful and bureaucratic, and is designed to maximize profits for big insurance companies, the pharmaceutical industry, Wall Street and medical equipment suppliers?\u201d To be clear: Sanders\u2019 single payer plan has zero chance of passing through the Republican-controlled Senate. No GOP senator will vote for it and it\u2019s not at all clear that many of the 10 Democrats up in 2018 in states that President Donald Trump won in 2016 will either. But, the number of 2020 wannabes willing to put their names to single payer still is important. Why? Because it shows that the energy in the Democratic Party is entirely within the liberal base. And for that base, it\u2019s not possible for a candidate to be \u201ctoo\u201d liberal on, well, anything. It also means the party is moving toward what was once considered the tilting-at-windmills approach of Sanders (who, it\u2019s worth noting, isn\u2019t technically a Democrat) and away from the reasoned pragmatism that Clinton preached in the 2016 campaign. That movement comes even as Clinton hits the media circuit to promote a book detailing her account of the 2016 election \u2013 an account filled with blame for Sanders who, she said, attacked her in ways that left her badly wounded for the general election. While it\u2019s clear the Democratic activist base wants the most liberal possible candidate to take on Donald Trump in 2020, it\u2019s less clear whether the broader public will go for a candidate advocating for single payer, or other long-time wish list proposals of liberals. The sheer number of serious Democrats siding with Sanders suggests we may get an answer to that question come 2020.",

Bernie Sanders will introduce his long-awaited single-payer health care bill with a cadre of the Democratic 2020 prospects expected to sign on as co-sponsors. Not long afterward, Connecticut Sen. Chris Murphy, another potential 2020 candidate, will propose an alternative: Allowing individuals and businesses to buy into Medicare. Both ideas have, at times, been labeled \u201cMedicare for all.\u201d But their differences also offer a glimpse at what\u2019s likely to be a defining debate within the Democratic Party in its next nominating contest: A full shift to a government health insurance system versus a partial step away from private markets. It\u2019s possible for some Democrats to support both ideas. Murphy, in an interview with Politico, portrayed his bill as a more politically practical bridge to Sanders\u2019 goal. \u201cWe\u2019re not going to pass a single-payer health care bill any time in the next few years. And so we need to have a conversation about how we get there,\u201d he said. The intra-party debate will heat up when Sanders\u2019 bill drops in the coming days. California Sen. Kamala Harris was the first to announce she\u2019d co-sponsor it. Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren said Thursday in a fundraising email that she\u2019d co-sponsor Sanders\u2019 bill, too. She wrote: \u201cMedicare for All is one way that we can give every single person in the country access to high quality health care. Everyone is covered. Nobody goes broke paying a medical bill. Families don\u2019t have to bear the costs of heartbreaking medical disasters on their own.\u201d Now, 2020 watchers\u2019 eyes are on two other high-profile Democratic prospects \u2014 New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand and New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker, both of whom have spoken supportively of the idea of single-payer health insurance recently \u2014 to see where they\u2019ll land. BIDEN\u2019S BEHIND-THE-SCENES MOVES: Former Vice President Joe Biden is keeping an active political calendar. Among the nuggets in The New York Times\u2019 Ken Vogel and Rachel Shorey story: Biden\u2019s staff has reached out to top Democratic donors to set up one-on-one meetings. Biden met privately in May with leaders of nine new or emerging progressive groups. And his political action committee has paid $47,000 to Blue State Digital, the firm that worked for the two Barack Obama-Biden campaigns. FRANKEN BLOCKS TRUMP\u2019S JUDGE PICK: Minnesota Sen. Al Franken is increasingly becoming a thorn in President Donald Trump\u2019s side \u2014 and breaking with his fellow in-state Democrat, Sen. Amy Klobuchar. This week, he announced he is opposing Trump\u2019s pick for a federal judgeship in his home state because Trump\u2019s choice would \u201csteer the already conservative Eighth Circuit even further to the right.\u201d Klobuchar says the nominee, state Supreme Court justice David Stras, should get a hearing.

            "article_content": "Menendez is currently on trial for public corruption two years after charges were filed against him Prosecutors accuse Menendez of accepting gifts, including vacations and donations New Jersey Sen. Bob Menendez\u2019s corruption trial is putting Senate Democrats in a bind. His fellow Democrats are eager to avoid the subject of Menendez\u2019s bribery trial, hoping that he is exonerated and then he can focus on his 2018 reelection battle in the Garden State. But there is fear inside Democratic circles that Menendez may get convicted and refuse to give up his seat, facing pressure to resign or an expulsion vote in the Senate. If the Democrat were to step aside while Gov. Chris Christie remains office, the Republican would pick a replacement. Yet if Menendez\u2019s legal problems worsen and he decides to run for reelection, it could jeopardize a key seat in a critical election year. Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer on Wednesday declined to say if he would stand by Menendez if he\u2019s convicted. Instead, Schumer said simply that the New Jersey politician is putting up a \u201cspirited defense\u201d and deserves to be presumed innocent until proven guilty. \u201cSen. Menendez is issuing a spirited defense,\u201d Schumer said Wednesday. \u201cWe all believe in the presumption of innocence in this country, and Sen. Menendez is fighting very hard. And we respect that greatly.\u201d Asked if he would continue to stand by Menendez if the New Jersey Democrat were convicted, Schumer ignored the question. Sen. Bob Menendez's bribery trial: Five things to watch Democrats who face reelection in 2018 also are in an awkward position \u2013 especially as prosecutors lay out the charges in a trial that could take weeks. \u201cWe are a country of laws,\u201d said Sen. Joe Manchin, a Democrat from the red state of West Virginia, who faces reelection next year. \u201cAnd I think people should just let this process go through before they come to judgment in any way shape or form.\u201d Asked if he\u2019d continue to stand by Menendez if he were convicted, Manchin declined to say, adding: \u201cWhatever the verdict is we\u2019ll deal with it at that time.\u201d Sen. Jon Tester, the Montana Democrat who also faces voters next year, also declined to comment, saying his attention has been focused on wildfires in his state. \u201cI haven\u2019t really been paying attention to the trial,\u201d Tester said. Menendez is currently on trial for public corruption two years after charges were filed against the New Jersey politician and his alleged co-conspirator, Dr. Salomon Melgen. Emotional start for Bob Menendez trial Prosecutors say Menendez acted in his \u201cofficial capacity\u201d to help advance personal and business interests of Melgen, and call the men\u2019s relationship a \u201ccorrupt pact.\u201d Prosecutors accuse Menendez of accepting gifts from Melgen, including luxurious vacations and large campaign donations, in exchange for help in government matters, including disputes over Medicare reimbursements. However, Menendez has denied the accusations and says he and Melgen are old friends, arguing that the gifts are legal. \u201cI have committed my entire adult life since I was 19 to fighting for the people of New Jersey,\u201d Menendez said Wednesday morning before entering federal court. \u201cNever, not once, not once have I dishonored my public office.\u201d Menendez also requested to modify the trial so he could be present for \u201ccritical votes,\u201d but his request was rejected by the federal judge overseeing the trial. How much trouble is Bob Menendez actually in? Menendez addressed the possibility of missing those votes while speaking to the press on Wednesday. \u201cNow the Constitution, like any citizen, gives me the right to ultimately assist in my defense in court and I intend to be here every day. The Constitution also gives me the right to cast a vote on behalf of the people I represent in the United States Senate. When the conflict exists if it becomes a conflict, a clash between those constitutional rights, I will make a decision based upon the gravity of the situation and the difference that my vote could make,\u201d he said. Sixty-seven members must vote to expel a senator from the body, meaning at least 15 Democrats would have to join the 52-member Senate Republican Conference in doing so. The governor is responsible for picking a possible replacement if he\u2019s convicted. If he is forced out of the Senate, depending on the timing, it could fall on current Gov. Chris Christie or his successor \u2013 New Jersey has a governor\u2019s race this year and Christie\u2019s term is up in January.

            "article_content": "Congress last overhauled the tax system in 1986 It's still unclear how Congress intends to pay for any tax cuts When lawmakers return this week from the August recess, they\u2019ll face a bevy of must-do tasks, but chief among them is a long-held Republican agenda item: comprehensive tax reform. Enthusiasm levels are high for the mountainous challenge, as tax reform is a widely popular idea, and Republicans are desperate for a major legislative accomplishment they can tout in next year\u2019s midterm elections. And it would be major: The last time Congress successfully passed a comprehensive tax overhaul was in 1986. While lawmakers in the tax-writing committees have been working on it for years, the current legislative effort is still in its infancy. Broad principles have been established, and President Donald Trump has begun to use his bully pulpit to make the case to the American people for the overhaul. But few details have been released to the public \u2013 in large part because they are still getting hammered out among Republicans. Trump pitches tax reform to 'bring back Main Street' Behind the scenes, staffers in the House Ways and Means Committee have been fleshing out the bullet points laid out by the White House in its call for a lower corporate tax rate, lower income tax rates and policies aimed at encouraging American businesses to bring overseas profits back home. But it\u2019s still unclear how Congress intends to pay for any tax cuts, or at least spare the deficit from taking a massive hit. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin told The Wall Street Journal Thursday that the Trump administration and congressional leaders plan to release a more detailed tax plan in the next few weeks. In the meantime, the White House will continue its messaging campaign to ramp up public support for a tax reform push \u2013 something Trump wasn\u2019t as active in doing during the failed attempt to repeal and replace President Barack Obama\u2019s health care law. It\u2019s one of the many lessons learned by both lawmakers and the administration. They\u2019re also painting a more united front than they had on Obamacare. Already, House and Senate leaders have formed a group called the \u201cBig Six,\u201d alongside Mnuchin and White House chief economic adviser Gary Cohn. The small group agreed to a set of shared goals ahead of the drafting process as part of a strategy to prevent the same kind of intra-party strife that helped take down the health care effort. Trump, who\u2019s scheduled to meet with all six leaders this week, said Wednesday in Missouri that he was \u201cfully committed\u201d to working with Congress on the issue, but still took the liberty to poke at lawmakers and throw more pressure their way. \u201cI don\u2019t want to be disappointed by Congress,\u201d he said in the tax reform speech. \u201cDo you understand me?\u201d But already some of those same tensions between conservatives and moderates that dominated the health care debate are echoed in tax reform. Members of the conservative House Freedom Caucus remain committed to tax reform,but they want to see a plan laid out before they agree to the first step: a budget. Congress plans to use a process known as reconciliation to overhaul the tax code, which allows the Senate to pass the tax bill with just a simple majority. But in order to do so, Congress has to first pass a budget with the instructions for tax reform. That is where conservatives\u2019 demands are. They want to ensure they support the broad contours of tax reform before they agree to the simple majority voting threshold. Those conservative members are also calling for steeper cuts to the corporate tax rate than some Senate Republicans. Members of the conservative House group want to see a corporate tax rate in the teens, while Senate Finance Chairman Orrin Hatch has warned that Republicans might have to settle for a more gradual drop from the current 35% to 25% rate. Members of the House Freedom Caucus have also warned that Congress must act on tax reform before the Thanksgiving recess or risk having nothing to show to voters ahead of the 2018 midterm election. Given the long list of must-pass items that remain on the docket this fall, that could be a tall order. But conservatives are not the only group that could make tax reform difficult. Democrats have already laid down their marker on where they stand. In a letter signed by all but three Senate Democrats, members have been unequivocal that they will not agree to a tax reform package that cuts taxes for the top 1% of earners or drives up the deficit. Democrats fear allowing GOP members to raise the deficit now with tax cuts will only result in Republicans eventually trying to roll back spending for mandatory spending programs like Medicare and Medicaid. While Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell has said he would welcome Democratic help in passing tax reform, it is becoming increasingly clear that it could remain a partisan exercise. The challenge for Republican leaders is to be more effective at uniting the moderate and conservative wings of their party on tax reform than they were on health care.",

            "article_content": "Menendez and Melgen have been charged with 18 counts of fraud and bribery crimes Both have entered a plea of not guilty Email correspondence, flight manifests, hotel bills, credit card statements and Federal Election Commission filings will all be deployed as evidence of an alleged bribery scheme carried out for seven years by Democratic New Jersey Sen. Bob Menendez and an associate, according to a new brief filed by prosecutors in federal court Wednesday. But the defense team called foul on prosecutors\u2019 court filing late Wednesday, saying it could taint the jury pool. The outline of the Justice Department\u2019s case came one week before the trial against Menendez and his co-defendant, Florida-based ophthalmologist Salomon Melgen, begins on September 6 in federal court in Newark, New Jersey. Menendez and Melgen have been charged with 18 counts of fraud and bribery crimes. Both have entered a plea of not guilty. Menendez and Melgen are accused of having a \u201cquid pro quo\u201d relationship going as far back as 2006. Prosecutors say that in exchange for luxurious vacations and large donations to his campaign coffers, Menendez used his power to advocate for various personal and business interests of Melgen\u2019s within the government. Jurors will also hear from many different witnesses, including Menendez staffers, State Department officials and even pilots who flew the private jet Menendez allegedly flew on as a part of his lavish, Melgen-sponsored vacations. Prosecutors further signaled that they plan to introduce charts to summarize documents for the jury, writing that this will be the most efficient way to communicate the 20,000 pages of admissible evidence to the jury. In Wednesday\u2019s trial brief, prosecutors also urged the court to ignore what they view as attempts by Menendez and Melgen\u2019s defense team to skew the facts of the case or to try to paint Menendez\u2019s acts in a positive light. Menendez allies have previously alleged that the senator\u2019s indictment was politically motivated. Poll: Most New Jersey voters want Menendez resignation \u201cThis case is about serious questions of fact and law related to the corruption of one of the highest elected offices in the United States government,\u201d the brief reads. \u201cIt is not about anonymous tips, Cuba, Iran, party politics or the political consequences of a conviction. The question of whether the defendants engaged in a corrupt scheme cannot be answered by the defendants\u2019 conspiracy theories. Rather, it only can be answered through a focused examination of the defendants\u2019 and their agents\u2019 own contemporaneous statements, black-and-white financial, government and business records, and live, non-anonymous witness testimony.\u201d Yet the defense team says DOJ\u2019s detailed court filing \u201cexacerbated\u201d the challenge of finding a juror that has not read media accounts of the case (one was dismissed for financial hardship last week and will be replaced). \u201cThe first 16 pages of this \u2018brief\u2019 seemed designed solely to generate adverse pretrial publicity for the defendants, giving the media a rhetorically florid preview of prosecutors\u2019 opening argument,\u201d said Raymond Brown, one of Menendez\u2019s lawyers, in a letter to the judge Wednesday. Last week, Menendez\u2019s attorneys also filed a motion asking the court to alert the trial schedule to allow the senator to participate in critical votes, including the future of the Affordable Care Act. \u201cBoth Sen. Menendez and the citizens who elected him, have an unquestionable interest in the senator\u2019s continued performance of the core legislative functions that the Constitution assigns to him alone,\u201d lawyers for Menendez wrote in the court filing. \u201c(A) trial schedule without some non-prejudicial accommodation of this dilemma directly interferes with the independent operation of the legislative branch by putting Sen. Menendez in the position of choosing between his individual rights to due process and confrontation on the one hand, and from discharging his core legislative duties on the other hand.\u201d US District Court Judge William H. Walls has yet to rule on the request, but signaled in court last week he was unwilling to entertain it. \u201cIf the senator wishes to absent himself at times for purposes of vote, that is his prerogative and I have no problem with that,\u201d Walls said. \u201cThe point is the senator is no worse and no better than any other defendant. Any defendant has a right to be present and any defendant has a right not to be present.\u201d After Menendez was elected to the US Senate in 2006, prosecutors say in the brief that Melgen began \u201ca pattern of treating Menendez to weekend and week-long getaways in the Dominican Republic that would continue for the next several years.\u201d Menendez and America's public corruption problem Melgen allegedly flew Menendez on his own private jet or on \u201cequally luxurious travel\u201d to his villa at Case de Campo, a luxurious resort in the Dominican Republic featuring amenities from beaches to polo fields. At one point, Melgen allegedly purchased a three-night hotel stay for Menendez at the Park Hyatt Hotel in Paris. Prosecutors say that Menendez never acknowledged these gifts on his annual financial disclosure forms. Melgen also donated heavily to Menendez\u2019s campaign and legal defense funds. At one point, Melgen donated more than $770,000 to various funds supporting Menendez over a five-month period. In return, prosecutors say, Menendez acted in his \u201cofficial capacity\u201d to help Melgen \u2013 a key hook for legal liability. After a Dominican company, purchased by Melgen, that had the exclusive right to install and operate x-ray imaging equipment in the Dominican Republic ran into a dispute with the government, Menendez allegedly \u201cexerted substantial pressure on the State Department to intervene with the Dominican government to resolve the dispute in Melgen\u2019s favor,\u201d according to the brief. Menendez also allegedly acted on Melgen\u2019s behalf in a dispute between Melgen\u2019s ophthalmology practice and the Center for Medicare and Medicaid Services. When the CMS formally demanded the Melgen pay back $8.9 million in Medicare overbillings, Melgen allegedly asked Menendez to \u201cweigh in with CMS,\u201d according to the brief. In 2009, Menendez allegedly called the director of the Center of Medicare and \u201cpressed the agency to approve Melgen\u2019s bills,\u201d according to the brief. Prosecutors say the same day as that call Melgen agreed to donate $60,000 to organizations supporting Menendez. Prosecutors also allege that Menendez pressured then-Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid to intervene with Melgen\u2019s billing dispute. In addition to personally calling the head of CMS and requesting that they carefully consider Menendez\u2019s request, Reid also allegedly reached out to the Obama White House to \u201chelp amplify the pressure on CMS\u201d in 2011. \u201c(T)he majority leader reached out to the White House deputy chief of staff, informing that Menendez was upset about how a Florida ophthalmologist was being treated by CMS and asking that she call the agency,\u201d according to prosecutors. \u201cRecognizing that the matter involved a dispute between a single doctor and an administrative agency, not a policy matter, the White House deputy chief of staff demurred.\u201d Beyond business matters, Menendez also allegedly got involved at different points in the visa cases of three international women, all allegedly girlfriends of Melgen\u2019s. The women, from Ukraine, Brazil and the Dominican Republic, were all attempting to visit Melgen in the United States. Menendez allegedly lobbied ambassadors and other officials in support of their visa applications, even intervening after one of Melgen\u2019s girlfriends and her sister, both from the Dominican Republic, had their visas denied.",

            "article_content": "Sen. Kamala Harris is the first Democrat to announce she\u2019ll co-sponsor Sen. Bernie Sanders\u2019 single-payer health care bill when it\u2019s introduced in September. The California freshman \u2013 seen as a rising star in the party and a 2020 presidential prospect \u2013 revealed her plans to back Sanders\u2019 legislation at a town hall Wednesday night in Oakland. \u201cHere, I\u2019ll break some news: I intend to co-sponsor the Medicare-for-all bill, because it\u2019s just the right thing to do,\u201d Harris said. She announced her support for Sanders\u2019 single-payer plan at the end of her town hall and joked that \u201csomebody should tell my staff.\u201d Her co-sponsorship is another sign that the Democratic Party is increasingly embracing a shift away from the private health insurance market and toward a government-run program. The issue is poised to become a major litmus test for its presidential candidates in 2020. It comes just 20 months after the party\u2019s last standard-bearer in a presidential election, Hillary Clinton, called Sanders\u2019 single-payer proposal \u201ca theoretical debate about some better idea that will never, ever come to pass.\u201d \u201cThis is about understanding, again, that health care should be a right, not a privilege. And it\u2019s also about being smart,\u201d Harris said. \u201cIt is so much better that people have meaningful access to affordable health care at every stage of life, from birth on. Because the alternative is that we as taxpayers otherwise are paying huge amounts of money for them to get their health care in an emergency room. So it\u2019s not only about what is morally and ethically right, it also makes sense from a fiscal standpoint, or if you want to talk about it as a return on investment for taxpayers.\u201d The early endorsement from Harris could clear the way for more Democrats to co-sponsor the bill. Already this summer, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren and New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand have announced their support for single-payer health insurance. Sanders tweeted his thanks to Harris on Wednesday night. \u201cLet\u2019s make health care a right, not a privilege,\u201d he wrote. Some of Sanders\u2019 most vocal supporters, who had questioned Harris\u2019 progressive bona fides, expressed cautious optimism about Harris\u2019 position. \u201cLike it or not, single payer has become the litmus test in order to run for office. I expect a a lot or senators to agree. But count on Bernie 100% to actually follow through,\u201d said RoseAnn DeMoro, the executive director of National Nurses United, the first major union to back Sanders\u2019 2016 presidential campaign. But DeMoro added she wants to hear single-payer supporters aggressively argue for the end of private insurance, too. \u201cI want to hear an actual articulation of the principles of single payer from these candidates, including that the insurance industry has no role. Bernie says that. Will they?\u201d she said. Winnie Wong, the co-founder of People for Bernie, said Harris is \u201cmeeting her constituents where they are. I see this as a pragmatic political decision.\u201d She added that it could revitalize a state-level debate in California about moving to a single-payer program.

            "article_content": "Democrats in Congress have different reactions to Trump's Charlottesville remarks Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti is going to New Hampshire Our weekly roundup of the news, notes and chatter about the prospects for the next Democratic presidential race: Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders is set to hit the road on a three-city Midwestern tour designed to show that his progressive policies have universal appeal. Sanders will be in Indianapolis on Monday for an event with union leader (and Trump Twitter target) Chuck Jones. Then he\u2019ll head to Portsmouth, Ohio \u2014 in a county Trump won by 37 points and which has been ravaged by the opioid crisis \u2014 and then Detroit, for an event with Rep. John Conyers. What do Sanders and Conyers have in common? Single-payer \u201cMedicare for all\u201d health care, of course. Conyers sponsored the major House Democratic proposal. Sanders is soon expected to introduce his own version in the Senate. If all goes according to plan, the trip could help Sanders show that \u201cMedicare for all\u201d sells in the Rust Belt \u2014 and it could also be a flattering contrast, one populist against another, as President Donald Trump heads West. An additional Bernie-world note: Some of Sanders\u2019 most vocal allies had tweaked a Democratic rising star, California Sen. Kamala Harris, on policy recently. That agitated some within the party. But McClatchy\u2019s Alex Roarty included an important quote in a story this week, in which Sanders\u2019 inner circle distanced the Vermont independent senator from those allies\u2019 criticisms of Harris. \u201cNobody part of Bernie\u2019s inner circle had anything to do with that, or would have any part of the criticism of Sen. Harris,\u201d said Mark Longabaugh, a senior aide to Sanders\u2019 presidential campaign. BOOKER\u2019S CONFEDERATE BILL: New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker is introducing legislation to remove statues from the Capitol that honor Confederate soldiers in the wake of the Charlottesville, Virginia, violence and Trump placing a share of blame on anti-racism counter-protesters, as well as the white supremacists, KKK members and neo-Nazis who rallied there. \u201cThe Capitol is a place for all Americans to come and feel welcomed, encouraged and inspired,\u201d he said. \u201cConfederate statues do the opposite.\u201d Where\u2019s Democratic leadership? Booker has the support of House Democratic leaders, including Nancy Pelosi. But Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer is trying to gently nudge Democrats toward the clearer political win \u2014 fighting the President over his response to white supremacists, rather than over statues. \u201cPresident Trump and Steve Bannon are trying to divert attention away from the President\u2019s refusal to unequivocally and full-throatedly denounce white supremacy, neo-Nazism, and other forms of bigotry,\u201d Schumer said in a statement. \u201cWhile it is critical that we work towards the goal of Senator Cory Booker\u2019s legislation, we must continue to denounce and resist President Trump for his reprehensible actions.\u201d Another Charlottesville reaction of note comes from California Sen. Kamala Harris, who wrote on Facebook: \u201c\u2018Many sides\u2019 is what kept children in this country at separate schools and adults at separate lunch counters for decades. \u2018Many sides\u2019 is what turned a blind eye when Emmett Till was lynched and stood silent when marchers were beat in Selma for \u2018disturbing the peace.\u2019 \u2026 It\u2019s not hard to spot the wrong side here. They\u2019re the ones with the torches and the swastikas.\u201d GARCETTI GOES TO NEW HAMPSHIRE: Los Angeles Mayor Eric Garcetti is headed to the Granite State for an August 28 fundraiser for Manchester mayoral hopeful Joyce Craig, per WMUR\u2019s John DiStaso. Garcetti has increased his travel outside California lately \u2014 visiting Wisconsin in June and speaking at a Center for American Progress event in Washington. Why is Garcetti interesting? 1) He is Latino and Jewish \u2014 or \u201cjust your average Mexican-American, Jewish-Italian,\u201d as he said at 2016\u2019s Democratic convention. 2) He was the first mayor in a major city to sign a $15 minimum wage. And 3) With Democrats\u2019 state-level power diminished, cities are proving to be a key source of anti-Trump resistance. MURPHY\u2019S LONG WALK: Connecticut Sen. Chris Murphy just completed a 105-mile walk across his state \u2014 a five-day trek that included four town halls and lots of Snapchat and Twitter updates, plus daily, photo-heavy Medium posts. (It\u2019s worth keeping in mind that Murphy, though in a safe state, is up for re-election in 2018 \u2014 so this is all about his home state, not 2020.) There are great Murphy scenes and quotes across Connecticut media. One that caught our eye: \u201cI have only had one guy give me the bird,\u201d Murphy said. \u201cI stopped and talked to a couple of guys in Southbury with Rush Limbaugh playing on the radio. I\u2019m pretty sure they\u2019re not fans of mine.\u201d STEYER\u2019S HEART IN THE NATIONAL FIGHT: Liberal mega-donor Tom Steyer, whose NextGen America group is a huge grassroots organizing force on the left, has long been seen as a potential candidate for California governor in 2018 or, in what would be a longer shot, the White House in 2020. At Netroots Nation in Atlanta, he sounded like his head and heart are in national issues right now. \u201cI would say it is hard for me not to think about that fight\u201d against Trump, Steyer said. He called Trump\u2019s presidency a \u201chistoric moment,\u201d said America\u2019s political divide \u201cis not shrinking, it\u2019s growing,\u201d and called the nation in \u201ccomplete crisis, honestly.\u201d WARREN\u2019S CULTURE FOCUS: Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren unveiled a new, stump-sounding speech at Netroots Nation, declaring the Democratic Party\u2019s gates successfully crashed and the ascendant progressive wing in full control. But what raised our eyebrows was how Warren weaved a cultural focus into her usual economic populism. At one point, Warren said Democrats are not \u201cgoing back to the days of welfare reform and the crime bill.\u201d Another prime example of Warren melding an economic and cultural message: \u201cI say we can care about a dad who\u2019s worried that his kid will have to move away from their factory town to find good work \u2013 and we can care about a mom who\u2019s worried that her kid will get shot during a traffic stop. The way I see it, those two parents have something deep down in common \u2013 the system is rigged against both of them \u2013 and against their kids.\u201d PREPARING FOR PENCE: The Democratic opposition research super PAC American Bridge 21st Century is preparing for Vice President Mike Pence \u2014 not Trump \u2014 to lead the Republican ballot in 2020. The group is particularly focused on Pence\u2019s ties to the Russia probe and to his handling of hate groups as Indiana governor, reports BuzzFeed\u2019s Tarini Parti. Monday, August 21 \u2014 Bernie Sanders kicks off his Midwest tour with a 4 p.m. ET rally with union leader Chuck Jones in Indianapolis. Tuesday, August 22 \u2014 Sanders is in Portsmouth, Ohio, for a 10:30 a.m. ET event focused on jobs, health care and the economy. Then, he\u2019ll be with Rep. John Conyers in Detroit for a 7 p.m. ET town hall where the two are likely to talk about single-payer \u201cMedicare for all\u201d health coverage. Tuesday, August 22 \u2014 Kamala Harris speaks at the 10 a.m. PT Lake Tahoe Summit, which is hosted by California Sen. Dianne Feinstein and will be attended by a bipartisan Nevada and California contingency, including Nevada Republican Gov. Brian Sandoval. One key focus will be combating climate change in the Lake Tahoe basin. Tuesday, August 22 \u2014 President Donald Trump is back on the campaign trail with a 7 p.m. MT mega-rally in Phoenix. Wednesday, August 23 \u2014 Elizabeth Warren holds a 6:30 p.m. ET town hall in North Dartmouth. It\u2019s her first of three: Warren has a town hall Thursday at 6:30 p.m. ET in Marshfield and one at the same time Friday in Concord. Minnesota Sen. Al Franken canceled on Bill Maher after the HBO host used the N-word on-air weeks ago. But Franken will appear this Friday on Maher\u2019s show, which airs at 10 p.m. ET. \u2026 Facebook\u2019s Sheryl Sandberg donated nearly $100 million in Facebook stock to a fund she uses for charitable contributions. \u2026 Gun advocates are criticizing Kamala Harris for calling for an assault weapons ban. Politically, this is what Harris might call a good problem. CNN\u2019s Greg Krieg, Sophie Tatum, Ashley Killough, Miranda Green, Tal Kopan, Saba Hamedy and Betsy Klein contributed to this memo.",

            "article_content": "Key Bernie Sanders backers recently dismissed Sen. Kamala Harris' prospects The new series of emotional and racially tinged arguments could shatter progress The online brouhaha set the stage for an in-person clash July 25 Sanders himself has pushed for party peace but has not weighed in recently In what should be Democrats\u2019 strongest moment since November, a series of emotional and racially charged clashes are forcing the party to once again confront the problem that has plagued it for a year: How to incorporate the supporters of Bernie Sanders. The Vermont independent senator himself is winning battles over the direction of the Democratic Party. He has emerged as a messaging leader on health care, appeared on a \u201cunity tour\u201d with the party\u2019s new chairman and helped craft a populist economic agenda for the midterm elections. Many Democrats even concede the possibility that Sanders could enter the 2020 presidential race as the party\u2019s frontrunner if he chooses to run. But even as Sanders and party leadership increasingly make ties on Capitol Hill, infighting with roots in the ideologically loaded and often deeply personal 2016 primary are threatening to blow up the d\u00e9tente. This new series of emotional and racially tinged arguments could shatter a fragile peace, forged in opposition to President Donald Trump, and undermine Democratic efforts to claw back control from Republicans in Congress during next year\u2019s midterm election season. \u201cUnity requires give and take. But it seems that it\u2019s just take, take, take from the Berniecrats,\u201d said Nina Turner, the president of Our Revolution \u2013 the political organization that emerged from Sanders\u2019 2016 run for president \u2013 using a term, \u201cBerniecrats,\u201d that Sanders supporters like Turner apply to themselves. Turner was appointed by Sanders to the DNC\u2019s \u201cunity commission\u201d in the wake of the 2016 contest. Her comments have led other members of the 21-person commission to grumble that Turner is more interested in sowing discord as a publicity and fundraising tool. But in an interview with CNN, she refused to back down. \u201cThe Berniecrats are being labeled as always wrong \u2013 \u2018they don\u2019t get it, they\u2019re too emotional, they don\u2019t want to win elections,\u2019\u201d Turner said. \u201cThis is a hurtful environment, and people are human and do have feelings. And so both sides are just duking it out.\u201d The anger that has simmered in Sanders\u2019 camp since the 2016 Democratic National Convention bubbled to the surface in comments from some of the Vermont senator\u2019s most prominent political allies and surrogates, particularly in two recent clashes. First, three key Sanders backers \u2013 National Nurses Union executive director RoseAnn DeMoro, pro-Sanders journalist Nomiki Konst and \u201cPeople for Bernie\u201d co-founder Winnie Wong \u2013 publicly dismissed Sen. Kamala Harris\u2019 prospects of winning over the party\u2019s progressive wing. The pointed quotes were picked up online when a Mic report, published after the California Democrat was feted by top party donors in the Hamptons, went viral in late July. Many Democrats saw the criticism of Harris as a needless and counterproductive jab at a rising star. But Sanders\u2019 backers \u2013 who tend to be younger and whiter than the overall Democratic electorate \u2013 were stung by suggestions that their distaste for Harris is fueled by race, like those from liberal MSNBC host Joy Reid, who tweeted: \u201cSo black Democrats must go begging young white leftists who were not numerous enough to nominate their preferred pick last time?\u201d \u201cSo odd, no, that these folks have (it) in for Kamala Harris and Cory Booker,\u201d tweeted Neera Tanden, the president of the Center for American Progress. The intense backlash provoked an equally sharp response from Sanders\u2019 allies, including Turner and the three who had initially panned Harris \u2013 DeMoro, Wong and Konst, none of whom are white men. The online brouhaha set the stage for an in-person clash July 25 \u2013 the same day the Senate would vote on a motion to proceed to the Republican Obamacare repeal bill, a coincidence that would lead some party officials to question Our Revolution\u2019s tactics and motives \u2013 just outside the Democratic National Committee headquarters in Washington. Turner led a group of 60 activists to deliver a petition to the DNC. Our Revolution had told DNC officials of its plans three weeks earlier, Turner said. When they arrived, DNC senior staffers greeted them on the steps with boxes of donuts and bottles of water. The building\u2019s security team uses crowd control measures when large crowds come, a DNC spokeswoman said. It\u2019s not an unusual step, particularly for a party that was hacked in 2016 and with the political world on edge after the shooting at a congressional baseball practice. DNC political director Amanda Brown Lierman spoke to the group on the building\u2019s steps, thanking them for their activism. But Turner \u2013 who is a Sanders-appointed member of the DNC\u2019s \u201cunity commission,\u201d a DNC member and a long-time Democrat \u2013 was upset she wasn\u2019t allowed into the building. \u201cWe understand the fire code. It\u2019s not our first time delivering petitions. We get it,\u201d Turner said. But, she added, the DNC could have invited her and five people delivering the petitions into the building to sit down and briefly chat. \u201cAnd then we could have walked out in five or 10 minutes, unified,\u201d Turner said. \u201cThey didn\u2019t even do that.\u201d The incident took on increased importance after Turner lashed out at the DNC in an interview with BuzzFeed, which was published late Wednesday. DeMoro, whose nurses\u2019 union provided crucial backing to Sanders\u2019 2016 presidential campaign, spoke to Turner after the story\u2019s publication. \u201cI told her that the problem here is that she\u2019s a movement leader. She\u2019s speaking truth to power,\u201d DeMoro said. Sanders\u2019 allies view any effort to diminish Turner as one designed to undercut Sanders. The primary reason: Sanders struggled with black and Latino voters in the 2016 Democratic primary. To win the nomination if he opts to run in 2020, Sanders will need to expand his base of support. In Turner, his allies see a powerful black female figure whose prominence showcases his broader appeal. \u201cThey would like to classify everyone as a \u2018Bernie Bro\u2019 \u2013 as a white guy, an angry white man,\u201d DeMoro said. \u201cWhat I think that (BuzzFeed) story indicates is Nina\u2019s effectiveness as a leader,\u201d DeMoro said. \u201cShe is a leader. And movement leaders are always under attack. Especially black movement leaders. So the narrative is to try and make them look unhinged, imbalanced \u2013 it\u2019s to make anyone who speaks truth to power look unstable.\u201d In both the backlash over Sanders allies\u2019 criticism of Harris and the DNC incident, Turner said she saw \u201cthe system\u201d \u2013 Democratic donors, Hillary Clinton-aligned operatives, in particular \u2013 \u201creally trying to continue trying to drive a wedge between progressive people of color and progressive whites.\u201d \u201cThey\u2019re using identity politics as a weapon,\u201d she said. By criticizing black Democrats such as Harris, Booker or former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick, Sanders supporters are \u201clabeled as a racist and a sexist. But they don\u2019t say the same thing when their side comes out and attacks somebody like me.\u201d That failure to defend her against racist attacks stings, said Turner \u2013 adding that she\u2019s personally been called \u201cBernie\u2019s Omarosa\u201d and \u201cBernie\u2019s Aunt Jemima.\u201d \u201cTo be called that and not have an outcry from the tone police, it\u2019s hypocrisy,\u201d Turner said. That\u2019s the Berniecrat leaders\u2019 view. Elsewhere in the Democratic Party, lawmakers and strategists are complaining that Sanders\u2019 allies are forcing the party to revisit its 2016 divides \u2013 at precisely the wrong time. \u201cIt is not good for the rebuilding that needs to happen within the party for Democrats to be attacking each other, and I think in particular the attacks on Kamala Harris are fruitless and unfair,\u201d said Brian Fallon, who was Hillary Clinton\u2019s national press secretary and is now a senior adviser at the Democratic super PAC Priorities USA. \u201cSen. Sanders is showing tremendous leadership in moving the Democratic Party in a progressive direction on issues from college affordability to Medicare for all,\u201d Fallon said. \u201cBut some of his supporters are undercutting that good work by trying to fast-forward to a 2020 presidential primary. We have too much important work that needs to be done before we start attacking people just because they\u2019re considered rising stars in the party.\u201d Others also said it appeared Sanders\u2019 allies were firing a 2020 starting gun too early \u2013 a charge both sides have now leveled against each other. \u201cOn balance and in the long run, the Bernie team\u2019s spat with Kamala Harris has actually been beneficial to her \u2013 it has raised her profile as a real contender in 2020 (otherwise, why would the Bernie folks feel so threatened?) and rallied the vast majority of the party in her defense,\u201d a Democratic operative said in an email. \u201cThat\u2019s not a good sign or look for Bernie Sanders and his team.\u201d The complaints from Sanders\u2019 supporters come at what has the potential to be Democrats\u2019 strongest moment since Clinton\u2019s 2016 election loss. The party leads Republicans in generic congressional polls. Its base is energized in a way Democrats haven\u2019t seen in years headed into the 2018 midterm elections. And a breach between President Donald Trump and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell is increasingly visible, with Trump attacking McConnell on Twitter. \u201cSo why in the world would the progressive forces that want to resist Trump, that want to win up and down the ballot \u2013 why in the hell would we be fighting with each other?\u201d another Democratic strategist said. \u201cA lot of Democrats who really very much care about the same set of progressive issues that Bernie Sanders cares about are champing at the bit to say \u2018What the f\u2014?\u2019 with Our Revolution.\u201d That strategist said Sanders needs to weigh in. \u201cThese things are being done in his name. Where\u2019s his sense of responsibility for reining these things in?\u201d A representative for Sanders said the senator, who is in Vermont during the congressional recess, could not be reached for comment. Several Democrats acknowledged that the party badly needs Sanders, whose supporters have remained loyal, within its fold \u2013 and said they see the recent dust-ups as disconnected from the Vermont senator and out of step with his post-election actions. Tanden described Sanders as \u201ca hugely important force\u201d in defending the Affordable Care Act from the GOP\u2019s repeal effort. She called him a \u201cstrategic leader in the amendment process,\u201d said Sanders \u201crallied the troops,\u201d and pointed to his use of a key committee post to force Republicans to drop elements of their health care bill through the enforcement of the procedural \u201cByrd Rule.\u201d \u201cI see, in his actions, him recognizing that we are facing the most right-wing administration in history. He himself has done a lot to unify people,\u201d Tanden said. Carolyn Fiddler, the political editor and senior communications adviser for the progressive blog Daily Kos, said Sanders\u2019 allies should \u201csort out their differences with Democrats and shift their focus back to the task at hand sooner rather than later.\u201d The DNC, meanwhile, would prefer to avoid a direct confrontation with Sanders\u2019 supporters \u2013 even as members of the party\u2019s \u201cunity commission\u201d complain that Sanders\u2019 own appointees to that commission sniped at Harris and, in Turner\u2019s case, unloaded on the DNC. \u201cThe DNC is focused on winning elections. That is our goal,\u201d said the DNC\u2019s Lierman, who met Turner\u2019s group of activists outside the party headquarters. \u201cAnd as we look at key races in 2017 and beyond, it\u2019s going to take progressives working together to bring about real change for working families. That is what we did when we defeated the Republican health care bill and that\u2019s what we will continue to do in races up and down the ballot,\u201d Lierman said. \u201cWe hope that all progressive leaders will join us in this fight.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Meet Troy Price -- he is the new Iowa Democratic Party chairmain It's Netroots Nation time \u2014 which means progressives are meeting in Atlanta Our weekly roundup of the news, notes and chatter about the prospects for the next Democratic presidential race: Congress is out and the Iowa State Fair is in \u2014 which means 2020 prospects are beginning to beat a path to the Hawkeye State. Maryland Rep. John Delaney, who\u2019s actually already running for president, is spending a few days with the Butter Cow. His visit kicks off a steadier pace of Democratic visits to Iowa. Tonight, Reps. Eric Swalwell and Elijah Cummings and former Missouri secretary of state Jason Kander are in Clear Lake for the Wing Ding. Two more 2020 prospects, Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar and Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders (already with plenty of Iowa roots), are scheduled to be in the state for separate events August 31. On September 10, the Progress Iowa Corn Feed will feature Oregon Sen. Jeff Merkley and South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg. The Polk County Steak Fry on September 30, with Reps. Seth Moulton, Tim Ryan and Cheri Bustos set to speak. A little more on the Iowa who\u2019s-who: Last week, we told you a little about Sean Bagniewski, the new Polk County party chair who is revitalizing the Steak Fry. Another important person to know is Troy Price, the new Iowa Democratic Party chair, who takes the job with the party at a crossroads there, faced with a dire need to attract moderate, independent and Republican-leaning voters to keep Iowa from losing its swing state status. Price put a big early win on the board this week, when a Democratic candidate scored a 10-point victory for a state legislative seat in a district President Donald Trump won by 22 points last fall. Price is a veteran of Hillary Clinton and Barack Obama\u2019s Iowa campaigns and is a former state party executive director. He got the job by winning over the state central committee\u2019s Clinton and Sanders factions. His first task is a potentially messy gubernatorial primary. But Democrats eying 2020 are excited about Price\u2019s presence. One veteran Democratic operative said Price is \u201cthe real deal. He is an operative who will be able to add real value to candidates and campaigns.\u201d \u201cHe knows Iowa just as well if not better than anyone in the state, has good relationships in all aspects of the party, and understands what it takes to run a caucus process \u2013 he has seen what can go right and wrong,\u201d another Iowa veteran Democratic operative said. \u201cThe caucus is a huge organizational lift not just for the campaigns but also for the party \u2013 they need someone who knows what they are doing if they\u2019re going to keep their spot in the primary calendar.\u201d PROGRESSIVES GATHER IN ATLANTA: It\u2019s Netroots Nation time \u2014 which means progressives are meeting at the Hyatt Regency in Atlanta. Two headliners are up Saturday: Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren will speak at a morning session that starts at 10:30 a.m. ET, and former Vice President Al Gore wraps up the day with a speech at a session kicking off at 4:30 p.m. \u2014 Warren, Moulton and former Gov. Deval Patrick give Massachusetts three presidential prospects. Warren and Patrick, in particular, are seen as viable. Here\u2019s the thing: Warren and Patrick are friends \u2014 and not just political friends. They and their spouses meet for dinner occasionally. Patrick told Politico on a recent podcast that he went to Warren for advice when he was considering a deal with a company at Bain Capital. So if both decide they\u2019re in, would they run against each other? Probably \u2014 they exist in separate lanes in the party, and Massachusetts donors might just hedge their bets and support both. 2020 NAMES ON NEW CENTRIST GROUP: There have been \u201cNew Democrats\u201d and \u201cBlue Dogs.\u201d This week, a new center-left group \u2014 called New Democracy \u2014 launched with a slate of mayors, governors and lawmakers aiming to steer the party in a pragmatic direction and win back some right-leaning areas. The 2020 prospects involved in the launch: Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper, New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu and Delaney, the insanely early entrant into the Democratic presidential race. A couple early-voting state names you should know who are involved: Steve Benjamin, the mayor of Columbia, South Carolina, and former Agriculture Secretary Tom Vilsack, who is from Iowa. GILLIBRAND PRESSES MEDICARE FOR ALL: New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand talked single-payer health insurance and \u201cMedicare for all\u201d with an option for anyone to buy in at a town hall this week. \u201cYou need to have that not-for-profit goal,\u201d she said. \u201cYour goal is to help people, not profit.\u201d At another point, Gillibrand said: \u201cMembers of Congress are 20 years behind the rest of America on their best day. So let\u2019s tell them that we want Medicare for all, we want a buy-in, and it doesn\u2019t matter if you\u2019re Democrat or Republican.\u201d CUOMO FEELS THE DEMOCRATIC PRESSURE: New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo tried to heal the intra-party rifts Democrats face in New York at a meeting last month \u2014 but was confronted with sharp pushback that The New York Times\u2019 Shane Goldmacher details. He writes: \u201cWhen the discussion turned to how to best win elections, Mr. Cuomo suggested to the assembled lawmakers \u2014 many of them from New York City \u2014 that the leader of eight breakaway Democrats, Senator Jeffrey D. Klein, had a better understanding of the suburbs than they had. That was all Senator Andrea Stewart-Cousins, the Senate minority leader who represents the suburbs of Westchester County, needed to hear. \u201c\u2018You look at me, Mr. Governor, but you don\u2019t see me. You see my black skin and a woman, but you don\u2019t realize I am a suburban legislator,\u2019 Ms. Stewart-Cousins said, according to the accounts of five people who were in the room. \u2018Jeff Klein doesn\u2019t represent the suburbs,\u2019 she said. \u2018I do.\u2019 Mr. Cuomo reacted in stunned silence.\u201d MARK CUBAN TWEETS POLITICS: Dallas Mavericks owner and billionaire Mark Cuban has been shooting the political breeze \u2014 a lot \u2014 on his Twitter feed. Scroll through his feed yourself to check some of it out. One highlight was his take on Trump TV. \u201cI don\u2019t know who is paying for it but It\u2019s smart and was inevitable. Why depend on 3rd parties to communicate your message? Do it yourself,\u201d Cuban tweeted. Asked whether people should question the legitimacy of those messages, Cuban responded: \u201cOf course. We should question everything we get from politicians. But using the internet to communicate was an obvious next step.\u201d He also talked Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake, uranium sales, Medicare billing mistakes and more. Friday, August 11 \u2014 The Iowa Democratic Wing Ding dinner in Clear Lake kicks off at 5 p.m. CT. Saturday, August 12 \u2014 Warren and Gore headline Netroots Nation, a progressive gathering in Atlanta. Tuesday, August 15 \u2014 Alabama voter go to the polls for the primaries in the special election for Jeff Sessions\u2019 former Senate seat. Sen. Luther Strange faces Rep. Mo Brooks and former Supreme Court chief justice Roy Moore, his top two challengers. In Utah, a three-way GOP race to replace retired Rep. Jason Chaffetz will also be settled. Minnesota Sen. Al Franken plans to appear at Tig Notaro\u2019s Bentzen Ball Comedy Festival in Washington on October 26-29. He\u2019ll chat with \u201cThis American Life\u201d host Ira Glass. \u2026 Merkley joined a rally for transgender rights this week in Portland. \u2026 Connecticut Sen.

            "article_content": "Relegated for decades to the back benches of American political life, a resurgent socialism, championed by figures like Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, is emboldening a new generation of mostly young, tech-savvy progressive activists and organizers. Over eight months, beginning with President Donald Trump\u2019s election victory and throughout the chaotic beginning of his administration, the Democratic Socialists of America have seen a massive spike in their ranks, from 8,000 in November to more than 25,000 as this week\u2019s biannual national convention begins in Chicago. Healthcare is a human right. Medicare for All is our fight. pic.twitter.com/u1cljJj6eb DSA members were on the front lines of the fight against Republican plans to overhaul Obamacare, often marching alongside more moderate protesters in defense of the law. And they are a vocal part of the emerging coalition in support of a single-payer health care system, or \u201cMedicare for all.\u201d But their ambitions are broader, with plans now to redraw the boundaries of socialism\u2019s influence in a country that has been traditionally hostile to similar movements. Activist Charles Lenchner, a New Yorker who worked on former Ohio Rep. Dennis Kucinich\u2019s 2004 presidential campaign and co-founded groups like Ready for Warren, in support of Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, and The People for Bernie Sanders, is running for DSA\u2019s National Political Committee this weekend. We spoke about the future of DSA, the opportunities and roadblocks up ahead, and his candidacy. (The interview has been condensed and slightly edited for clarity.) Krieg: You\u2019ve been around the world as an activist and an organizer, most recently as a member of DSA and co-founder of Ready for Warren and The People for Bernie Sanders. How did you get started? Lenchner: In high school. Israel, where I spent most of those years, has lots of political parties and all of them cultivate youth leagues, so there is a lot more going on, as opposed to in the United States where you don\u2019t have political parties in a parliamentary sense. So there isn\u2019t really an infrastructure that exists at all levels that gets young people interested and involved. Why Sanders is a good fit for Warren backers At age 15 or 16, I assumed people were curious about each other and connect and see what\u2019s up. I thought that Arab citizens would be as interested in connecting with me as I was with them. I can now laugh at that, but that\u2019s how I felt at the time. It was very wholesome. Most wholesome I\u2019ve ever been. And then, as the army got closer, I became more left-wing and more invested in figuring out how to end Israel\u2019s occupation and more ideological because I saw that it was really just the left that was trying to end it. So I got involved in left-wing organizations. Over a year before my draft date I organized a youth group and this youth group recruited people who pledged to refuse to serve in the Occupied Territories. Think of me as a high school senior meeting every week with other young people who are all intent on being jailed. We were going to be drafted, go to basic training, and then they\u2019ll send us to the West Bank and we\u2019ll say no, and then we\u2019ll go to jail. That was plan. And that\u2019s what happened. I was the first one of the group to be drafted and the first one to be sent to the West Bank and the first one to be sent to prison. All in all I spent about two months in Israeli military prison during the First Intifada for refusing orders to serve there. I was already fully committed to left-wing politics, but imagine living your life knowing that you survived two months in prison. It\u2019s very hard to become demoralized. I\u2019ve been in solitary confinement for weeks at a time. What are you going to throw at me now? Krieg: How does someone go from the experience you just described \u2013 entering left politics as a young person, organizing, being jailed \u2013 to your life this past decade, when you\u2019ve mostly worked for or on behalf of relatively mainstream politicians, like Dennis Kucinich, and causes? Lenchner: It was a long process. I\u2019ve been continuously in the US for about 17 years now. In those years, I started off working for organizations that were based in the Middle East and then I moved into politics by working with Kucinich in 2003. It was a very long, slow process of becoming a more professional activist and understanding the world I\u2019m operating in. I\u2019m still learning and careful not to pretend to be that guy who knows everything. I\u2019m not. But the left has a tendency to put itself in this self-imposed ghetto. For me, it was always clear that the best place to be in politics is where the energy is. And being able to participate in mainstream movements isn\u2019t a contradiction to being a leftist. I would turn it around and say, if you want to be a good leftist, how can you defend not being where the people are? Krieg: DSA is growing, obviously, but a 300% or 400% spike in membership doesn\u2019t happen if you\u2019re healthy to begin with or if you\u2019d had more than a few thousand people as late as last Election Day. The organization has been around for decades. Why did it become so stagnant \u2013 and why is it multiplying now? Lenchner: The reason why it grew so rapidly is a combination of Bernie Sanders and Donald Trump. It is a reminder that while individuals and organizations have a certain amount of power, the circumstances that we exist within, those are the determining things. The people that have carried the torch for DSA for years may have asked themselves, What are we doing? Handful of people meeting in living rooms, having meetings that attract few new members. What are we doing here? Now, we know. They were keeping the organization intact for this moment. In that sense, it\u2019s a reminder that you may sometimes feel as though you\u2019re not in the center of things the way you want to be, but everyone has a role. And all those DSA folks who kept the torch alive for all those decades when it wasn\u2019t as prominent \u2013 we would not be here if not for them. We owe them everything. Krieg: Beyond the reaction to Trump and the energy created or channeled, or both, by Sanders, why is this group now growing so fast \u2013 and what is going to take to keep that up beyond these current circumstances? Lenchner: We\u2019re an organization that is simultaneously socialist, but also very rooted in a real world of politics. We\u2019ve participated in Democratic Party primaries like with Bernie Sanders and in other elections around the country. We have a tradition of not being outside the political system, but just on its left edge. That\u2019s true for us in a way that is not true for a lot of other left wing organizations. That meant that we were in the position where we could really grow. Also, because DSA had so few chapters and, in a sense, because DSA was small, it meant that new people joining the organization had the real feeling that they could make it their own. If we were a stronger, more robust organization eight months ago, then people joining us would have been swallowed up by a whole system ready to instruct new members. Instead, we opened up the doors to 15,000 people who now have the challenge of figuring out what they want the organization to be. We\u2019re lucky that DSA is the kind of open organization where that is the kind of challenge that is welcomed and not seen as a threat. Krieg: So when a political organization, especially one dedicated to democratic principles, quadruples in size it is effectively a different thing. Most of the people who are members now were not a year ago. How does DSA keep manage its identity now when, as we\u2019ll see this weekend, rival factions begin to emerge and potentially clash? Lenchner: Let me answer that this way: my head is at \u2013 I\u2019m imagining us as an organization of 100,000 members and I keep asking myself, What are things going to look like then? What are the kinds of realities that we\u2019re going to face if we grow another 500% of the next few years? What is it going to look like when we elect multiple DSA members to Congress? We\u2019ve had people in high political office. When it happens again, the next wave, some of the conflicts that we might suffer from today will be irrelevant. It\u2019s important to hold on to that fact and realize we\u2019re on a rocket ship trajectory and that things that loom large today are going to seem insignificant in two or three years. Krieg: Do you envision DSA as being an organization that, as time goes by and in addition to its advocacy, runs candidates for as many offices as possible, or do you see more in the vein of the Working Families Party, which might have a ballot line but is fundamentally, electorally, is about providing support and endorsements in primaries? Lenchner: DSA is not a political party and that\u2019s an important distinction. We are not on any ballot. Our sense is that instead of committing ourselves to being a political party, we have the freedom to run people within any political context that makes sense. That might mean a nonpartisan election, like they have in Seattle, it might mean inside a Democratic primary, it could mean as a third party member \u2013 all of these options are open to us precisely because we are not a political party. Becoming a party would constrain us. Instead, we get to offer a hand to any alliance, any relationship where we think we can advance a left agenda. That means forming coalitions with other entities and it means creating in this country, for the first time in many generations, entire constituencies that are devoted to democratic socialism. When you think of constituencies in American politics, people often break it down by demographics. What do women of color want? What do white seniors want? But imagine a world where, in addition, you have ideological blocs that are saying, We\u2019re the constituency for single-payer, we\u2019re the constituency for not instigating disastrous wars in the Middle East \u2013 creating entire blocs of voters that hold firm to those principles \u2013 and threaten any politician who disregards them. That\u2019s what DSA, with a big boost from Bernie Sanders, is bringing back to American politics. Krieg: When we\u2019ve spoken in the past, you tended to be either advocating a policy or for a candidate. Building a political organization is obviously not that. It\u2019s more abstract. Maybe more difficult. You can\u2019t, as an example, paper over an internal policy dispute with some beloved candidate. How is it different? Lenchner: Because DSA is, by design, a big tent organization, it means that the more successful we are, the more competing and cooperating strands there are going to be. So in an effort like the Sanders campaign, you might work with unlikely allies, but you have a mission. You are winning votes for one person. Everyone pumped for #DSAcon17?! pic.twitter.com/qC21unVMTV When you\u2019re with an organization that has more than one school of thought, you don\u2019t always have that one defining goal that makes everyone line up and work together easily. In that sense, we\u2019re probably going to have some of the dysfunctions of a family, where we all come together for holidays but it doesn\u2019t mean we don\u2019t fight. I don\u2019t know that this is a bad thing. And it\u2019s not as though our counterparts in other places don\u2019t have their own internal fights, as well. I was thinking, even within the Trump White House, I can\u2019t think of anyone at DSA talking about someone else at DSA sucking their own c\u2013k (A reference to Trump\u2019s now-former communications director). We\u2019re just not there yet! And, frankly, because we don\u2019t hold that much institutional power, there is a great deal of good humor and patience that might not exist if we were actually in control of levers of policy and budgets in this country. Krieg: There has been a dust-up, among DSA people and friends of the movement, in recent weeks over Syria policy, a particular blog post seemed to trigger it, and there is going to be a vote on BDS (a movement to divest from and sanction Israel) in Chicago. What do you think is the single most pressing issue, politically, facing DSA now? Lenchner: I wouldn\u2019t say \u201cpressing,\u201d but I can tell you there is clearly a spectrum where, on one side, you have people who feel as though DSA has been a little bit too attached to Democratic Party politics and their goal is to liberate DSA so that it\u2019s more free to explore building power and competing outside the framework of Democratic Party primaries or supporting Democratic candidates. And then, in contrast, you have other folks who are saying, well, we don\u2019t think that the Green Party strategy is very useful. We don\u2019t think that other socialist organizations that have hovered on the margins have been especially successful. We think that if the majority of working class voters are still inside the Democratic Party, it makes sense for us to compete there and make sure Republicans don\u2019t win. But you have to remember that it\u2019s not two completely different schools of thought. Even the people who are one side will still concede that the other folks have a point and ought to win some of the times. So, for example, there are very few Democratic Party loyalists within DSA who aren\u2019t perfectly fine working with the Working Families Party, which is in fact a third party. Or that aren\u2019t supportive of efforts to back someone like (Seattle city council member) Kshama Sawant, who belongs to a rival organization (called Socialist Alternative), but clearly has earned broad left support. And on the other side, even the folks who have more of an affinity to third parties, I haven\u2019t heard anyone say that working for Bernie Sanders was a mistake. Not a single one. We live with these contradictions in a much more intense ideological way and that\u2019s something that, for instance, regular Democratic Party politics doesn\u2019t have to concern itself with. Krieg: Do you expect the measure to support BDS will pass? Lenchner: Yes. By an 80% margin. Krieg: Which brings us back to the Democratic Party. You\u2019re talking about keeping a foot inside the tent. BDS is not looked upon too kindly by many liberals. Democratic leaders in Washington have their names on a bill that would effectively criminalize it. How do you manage those channels \u2013 do you try? Lenchner: The truth is that, most young people, don\u2019t have that loyalty to the traditional politics of supporting Israel, right or wrong. Because DSA is made up largely of young people who don\u2019t need to worry about fundraising goals for the DNC, they don\u2019t need to worry about Chuck Schumer\u2019s fundraising for the DSCC \u2013 why shouldn\u2019t they support policies that are much more critical of Israel? There is literally nothing institutionally to prevent them from going to the mat for something like Palestinian human rights. There is just no barrier to that. Palestine is a wedge issue on the left. It is a convenient marker. As in, \u201cAre you really on the left? Show it by supporting BDS. Oh, you won\u2019t do that? Well, you\u2019re not really a leftist.\u201d BDS is a litmus test \u2013 not that consequential at this point \u2013 for an organization that is trying to assert itself as \u201cnot-the Democratic Party.\u201d It\u2019s not as if DSA is suddenly becoming an organization primarily focused on foreign policy. Krieg: When you announced you would be running, there was a line that caught my eye \u2013 you say you want to \u201cprofessionalize the management of DSA.\u201d Given the scorn so many progressives, and certainly leftists, have for professional consultants in politics, how do you go about making this argument with people who instinctively reject it? Lenchner: First of all, let me be clear: I adore the current staff. But they are going to expand and change to meet the needs of a growing organization. When I was younger, I was lucky enough to be taken to Scandinavia, to places like Sweden and Denmark, and I found there that the government and various other entities fund youth organizations where the people in charge are young people \u2013 high school and college students \u2013 but the staff are adults who have been working there for years. And it was clear that the hierarchy was that the staff was under the control of these elected student bodies. I thought it was great. The young people are in charge! But when it comes to filing your taxes or making sure the payroll happens on time, why wouldn\u2019t you have people who do that for a living be the ones doing it? In the same way, DSA needs to focus on being a participatory democratic organization, but things like making sure fundraising letters are sent, or making sure that internal elections are done properly, or providing support for programs \u2013 that\u2019s the kind of stuff that I feel like there\u2019s a division of labor among people who have specific job functions and the organization as a whole, which is made to function politically. But that expertise is not well distributed or made available at the chapter level. And in some ways, the left sometimes has a hard time drawing a line between those two things. I\u2019m not certain that the person who is making sure people renew their membership dues has to be motivated by pure socialist principles. I\u2019d like them to be motivated by what the percentage of membership renewals. Krieg: So we\u2019re a little more than six months into Trump\u2019s time in office. DSA grew in his wake. Where do you want the organization to be in three and a half or so years, as the country is going back to the polls in November of 2020? Lenchner: I don\u2019t know if I have a direct answer. I think that socialists are more likely to be impactful in local elections. The situation we had with Bernie in 2016 is kind of unique. I\u2019d point out this: There is always going to be a conflict within the Democratic Party between people who want things like single-payer and other folks who are focused on fundraising and making peace with corporate interests that are more aligned with Democrats. And there\u2019s nothing wrong with that. It\u2019s a fact of life in our political system. What\u2019s new is that there hadn\u2019t been as many organizations mobilizing the left side of that equation and being able to do it by raising small dollar donations, enough that can actually compete with the big money that comes from PACs and wealthy individuals. That\u2019s new and that constituency isn\u2019t just DSA, bravely alone waving a red flag, that\u2019s a whole sector \u2013 that\u2019s Our Revolution, that\u2019s (new Our Revolution president and former Ohio state senator) Nina Turner, that\u2019s unions who supported Sanders, that\u2019s people like Kshama Sawant in Seattle. DSA is one component in the growth of larger left impacting American politics. Hell yeah. Our delegates can't wait to get down to business here in Chi-town! #DSACon17 pic.twitter.com/6tIAS7lN7S And that sector is now able to exert so much power we\u2019re seeing Cory Booker try to legalize marijuana at the federal level? Seeing folks like Kamala Harris rhetorically endorse single-payer? We\u2019re basically seeing a massive shift of otherwise mainstream Democrats bend over backwards to use the words and the policy positions of people that are far to their left \u2013 and they\u2019re doing it because we actually have the gravitational pull for a change. Just imagine where that will take us after DSA spends a few years capacity-building and learning the skills and knowing the differences between voter file software and how to manage active canvassing campaigns. Once we get that better mastered, I think you\u2019re going to see the number of openly socialist candidates holding office rise from less than 100 to many thousands, as was the case in the heyday of the Socialist Party.",

Bernie Sanders said there should be a government-funded health insurance option \u201cin every state in this country.\u201d \u201cIf people don\u2019t like the private insurance that they\u2019re getting, they should have a Medicare-type public option available in every state in this country,\u201d Sanders said on CNN\u2019s \u201cState of the Union.\u201d Sanders, an independent senator who caucuses with Democrats and became a member of the Senate Democratic leadership following his presidential bid last year, has long made a call for universal coverage one of his key objectives. Asked on Sunday if he would follow through on his pledge to submit single-payer legislation, in which the government would shoulder the health care costs for all, Sanders said, \u201cAbsolutely, of course we are.\u201d As part of this new push for single-payer legislation, Sanders said his team was looking at a way to build a popular consensus around health care as a right, regardless of income level. \u201cWe\u2019re figuring out how we can mount a national campaign to bring people together,\u201d he said. Sanders conceded that it was a politically difficult proposal, not just because Republicans control the levers of power in Washington and are strongly opposed to such a large government program, but because of the entrenched interests standing against it. He pointed to those same interests when asked why an attempt to build a single-payer program in Vermont had collapsed. \u201cTaking on the insurance companies and the drug companies, taking on Wall Street, taking on a lot of very powerful forces that make billions of dollars a year from the current health care system is not going to be easy, and it\u2019s not going to take place until millions of people get involved in this struggle,\u201d Sanders said. Sanders has campaigned around the country for months on health care, decrying Republican attempts to repeal Obamacare and pushing Democrats to the left on the issue. The senator\u2019s reference to planning a national campaign on health care came as he is due to speak in Iowa next month to promote his book, the \u201cBernie Sanders Guide to Political Revolution,\u201d which has compounded speculation that he is planning a 2020 bid. Sanders again declined on Sunday to say what his plans were one way or the other, although he allowed for the possibility that he would run for president again. \u201cWe got three years before the presidential election,\u201d Sanders said. \u201cWe got plenty of time for candidates or potential candidates to make decisions.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Rep. John Delaney is a Maryland congressman who has strong business background Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders plans to introduce his single-payer health insurance bill Our weekly roundup of the news, notes and chatter about the prospects for the next Democratic presidential race: The 2020 Democratic presidential race now officially has its first candidate: Maryland Rep. John Delaney. The third-term congressman announced his plans to run for president in a Washington Post op-ed Friday afternoon. Delaney, 54, won\u2019t run for re-election and is bypassing a run for Maryland governor in 2018. Let\u2019s be honest here: More than anything, this reflects the reality that just about every elected Democrat thinks a couple big things: 1) They can beat Trump, and 2) The best-known Democratic prospects \u2013 former Vice President Joe Biden, Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders, Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren \u2013 all have good reasons they might not run, which could mean a truly wide-open race. After all, another Maryland Democrat, former Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley, also looks likely to run. Why do even Delaney\u2019s allies admit he is an extreme longshot? Beyond his lack of a national profile, Delaney is well to the right of the Democratic primary electorate, including his support for the Trans-Pacific Partnership trade deal. He previously pushed minimum wage hikes, but for amounts short of the $15 an hour that progressives have sought (and Delaney now says he backs). He has proposed allowing businesses to repatriate money earned overseas without paying taxes in exchange for buying infrastructure bonds. \u201cI don\u2019t really see it, but I think if he does this he will try to be the solutions candidate aimed at making Washington work again,\u201d said one Democratic strategist who has worked with Delaney. \u201cHe has a record of creating thousands of jobs as the CEO of two publicly traded companies that he built from scratch after being raised in a union household\u201d in New Jersey, the strategist said. Delaney could also spend millions of his own dollars on a race. Time to talk single-payer? Democrats won a huge health care victory in the wee Friday morning hours. So what\u2019s next? Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders plans to introduce his single-payer health insurance bill \u2013 \u201cMedicare for all,\u201d as he\u2019ll cast it \u2013 in September, an aide told CNN. The big question is which Democratic 2020 prospects will support it. Already, Warren and New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand have embraced single-payer. California Sen. Kamala Harris expressed support for \u201cthe concept\u201d in May, when she said health care access should not be \u201ca function of your income,\u201d and again in July \u2013 but cautioned the details are key. The Democratic base will demand she and others weigh in on the issue and on Sanders\u2019 bill, and it\u2019s likely to be a central issue in the 2020 nominating contest. \u201cSingle-payer is the absolutely the price of admission for our 2020 nominee both morally and politically,\u201d one Democratic operative said. A more skeptical operative said the party\u2019s 2020 primary could be \u201ca suicidal litmus test\u201d on single-payer. Republicans tried to troll Democrats into voting for a single-payer bill that had no hope of passing Thursday. Democrats didn\u2019t take the bait. Warren\u2019s fingerprints on Democrats\u2019 agenda Warren was among the Democrats in Berryville, Virginia, to roll out a new agenda for the midterm this week. It was all economic populism, all the time, with a big anti-trust emphasis. Where\u2019d that come from? Read this June 2016 Warren speech at a New America think tank event, and you\u2019ll see her fingerprints all over it. Speaking of anti-trust, New Jersey Sen. Cory Booker told Recode the government needs to keep a much closer eye on Amazon and Google. \u201cThis consolidation that\u2019s happening all over the country is not a positive trend,\u201d he said, pointing to Amazon\u2019s bid to buy Whole Foods and Google\u2019s cable and telecom mergers. Trump\u2019s transgender ban Gillibrand was among the harshest Democratic critics of Trump\u2019s transgender military service ban, saying she was working on legislation to block it. She said on CNN she \u201ccan\u2019t think of anything less patriotic\u201d and called the ban \u201coutrageous.\u201d Gillibrand has said she\u2019s not running in 2020. But many Democrats don\u2019t believe her, and see her as a strong contender. Gillibrand\u2019s biggest weakness, which some operatives told me they see her actively working to address, is that she was a moderate \u201cBlue Dog\u201d in the House whose previous positions on guns and same-sex marriage could prove problematic with the progressives. Moulton a 2020 prospect? Massachusetts Rep. Seth Moulton is profiled by Politico\u2019s Michael Kruse as an \u201cinsider who\u2019s an outsider.\u201d Focused heavily on Kruse\u2019s military record \u2013 he went to Iraq four times \u2013 Kruse finds those who know him speaking of a White House run as more of a question of when than if. \u201cI\u2019m not running for president, man,\u201d Moulton said. Landrieu keeps his options open New Orleans Mayor Mitch Landrieu is tamping down speculation that he might run for president in 2020 \u2013 sort of. At least in the present tense. \u201cThe answer to the question is I\u2019m not running for president,\u201d Landrieu told David Axelrod on \u201cThe Axe Files,\u201d a podcast from the University of Chicago Institute of Politics and CNN. \u201cYou\u2019d never rule out running (for) anything, you never say never about anything, but I\u2019m not running.\u201d An unusual approach to Trump New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo is the rare Democrat who almost never says President Donald Trump\u2019s name \u2013 a weird tactic for a big-state governor in a party fueled by resisting Trump. He blasted Trump\u2019s decision to ban transgender Americans from military service as a \u201cWashington directive,\u201d The New York Times\u2019 Shane Goldmacher notes. \u201cAs a general rule, I haven\u2019t found nasty ad hominem attacks on a person whose cooperation is needed to help your state especially helpful,\u201d Cuomo told Goldmacher. Calls for an African-American on the ticket At the NAACP\u2019s convention in Baltimore, organization members said they wanted to see a black person on Democrats\u2019 2020 ticket, per McClatchy\u2019s William Douglas and Katishi Maake. Among the people to watch: Harris, Booker, former Attorney General Eric Holder and former Massachusetts Gov. Deval Patrick. Tuesday, August 1 \u2013 Minnesota Sen. Al Franken will sit down with NBC\u2019s Seth Meyers for a talk about Franken\u2019s book at the Great Hall at Cooper Union in New York City.

We\u2019re watching to see who the featured speaker will be at the Des Moines event that\u2019s seen as a must for future presidential contenders. Expecting they could still be in Washington voting on health care, senators all kept their schedules open for the next week. Hillary Clinton\u2019s forthcoming book \u201cWhat Happened\u201d is still six weeks away \u2013 but it shot to the top of Amazon\u2019s best sellers list with pre-orders when the title and covered were announced this week. \u2026 Michelle Obama was in Denver this week, discussing how she overcame racist jabs. \u201cThe shards that cut me the deepest were the ones that intended to cut,\u201d she said.

            "article_content": "Bernie Sanders' backers have landed seats in Iowa's county and state Democratic parties Sanders' Iowa campaign director in 2016 is eying a run for Congress Other 2020 Democrats have adopted similar policy priorities to Sanders Sen. Bernie Sanders is likely years away from deciding whether he\u2019ll run for president again in 2020, when he\u2019d be 79 years old on Election Day. But by keeping his base energized through visits \u2013 including a boisterous event here last weekend \u2013 and with his allies increasingly stepping into local races and gaining power inside the Democratic organizations they felt locked out of in 2016, Sanders\u2019 message is clear: The 2020 Iowa caucuses will take shape around him. Sanders came inches from besting Hillary Clinton in Iowa in 2016. His political organization has become more sophisticated since then, both nationally with Our Revolution, the progressive group spawned by his campaign, and in the states, where supporters are organizing to provide him a clear path to the nomination \u2013 if he wants it. Whether he runs again or not, Sanders\u2019 backers and Iowa Democratic strategists say the Vermont senator\u2019s strength in the Hawkeye State will force other candidates to either embrace his influential message or risk running up against it. \u201cIf you\u2019re talking 2020, regardless of what the name of the person is, as this party moves forward, the things that Bernie Sanders talks about are starting to coalesce as the things that you\u2019re going to need to address in order to be successful in the party,\u201d said Pete D\u2019Alessandro, who was Sanders\u2019 Iowa campaign director in 2016, continues as his main conduit in the state now and will soon likely become a Democratic candidate himself in a competitive race for Republican Rep. David Young\u2019s US House seat. When Sanders began selling his \u201cpolitical revolution\u201d in his first trip to Iowa in May 2015, he had a bare-bones campaign infrastructure and no significant support from local elected officials. Twenty-six months later, Sanders-backers have landed positions in Iowa\u2019s county and state Democratic parties and are candidates in its governor\u2019s race and, in D\u2019Alessandro\u2019s case, at least one congressional contest. When Sanders arrived last Saturday for his first Iowa visit of 2017, D\u2019Alessandro drove him to the populist Iowa Citizens for Community Improvement\u2019s convention, where 750 activists had gathered for detailed sessions by 9 a.m. \u2013 hours before Sanders would arrive. \u201cDuring his campaign I saw how things worked and I realized that if I wanted to be more impactful than just showing up at rallies and organizing or taking an arrest, if I wanted to change the political landscape, that I would have to commit to being involved in the party,\u201d said Jessica Fears, a 30-year-old waitress who has landed posts with the Story County and state Democratic parties and is a member of the Iowa Citizens for Community Improvement. D\u2019Alessandro said the evolution has been stark. \u201cWe had nobody \u2013 six elected officials in the whole state,\u201d he said. \u201cWe did have a scattering of some county chairs that were for us. But we had nobody on the state central committee. The highest ranking elected official in Iowa who endorsed Bernie Sanders was county supervisor. We had nobody above that level, we had nobody in the statehouse, we had no statewide electeds. We had no one.\u201d \u201cSo when you go from zero to almost half of the state central committee of people who said they were Sanders folks, that\u2019s a big, big jump,\u201d the Iowa veteran added. \u201cThese things usually take longer.\u201d Democrats in the state and nationally who are more pessimistic about a Sanders 2020 campaign say they see him as the front-runner by virtue of his organizational head start and his influence on the party\u2019s policy positions on health care, college affordability and income inequality \u2013 but they don\u2019t see him as the favorite in a nominating contest still years away. Sanders\u2019 age and the questions about his wife Jane Sanders\u2019 actions in her role at the now-defunct Burlington College are potential liabilities. Democratic operatives also say Sanders would face heavier and wider-ranging attacks on his politics and character in a wide-open primary than he did against Clinton, whose team was confident for much of their battle that her delegate lead would hold. And while they concede that Sanders\u2019 allies have grown in numbers in the county and state parties, they\u2019re also quick to note the next state chair and the party\u2019s 2018 gubernatorial nominee aren\u2019t likely to come from his political orbit. The core of Sanders\u2019 permanent Iowa team includes D\u2019Alessandro; Evan Burger, who was Sanders\u2019 deputy state director and is now a senior organizer for the group that hosted him over the weekend; and Robert Becker, a 2016 Sanders campaign veteran who recently returned to Iowa to consult for D\u2019Alessandro\u2019s expected congressional bid and in the governor\u2019s race. Despite their growing influence, Iowa Democrats in Sanders\u2019 camp aren\u2019t talking about 2020 yet \u2013 at least not out in the open. A competitive primary to take on Republican Gov. Kim Reynolds next year, combined with turmoil at the state Democratic Party \u2013 where the chair, Derek Eadon, resigned in late June, citing health reasons \u2013 are \u201csucking all the air out of any discussion of 2020,\u201d one Democratic operative there said. And in Iowa, like elsewhere, Democratic voters are preoccupied with fighting President Donald Trump \u2013 with most of activists\u2019 energy in recent months being poured into the health care battle. Nationally, ambitious Democrats know not to focus too heavily on 2020 \u2013 so they\u2019ve been cautious about treading too heavily onto early-state terrain. Sanders will make his second visit for a book talk in Iowa City on August 31. Minnesota Sen. Amy Klobuchar, who Democratic operatives have said has been more frank than many about her presidential aspirations, will be in Ames the same day for her second visit to Iowa in 2017. Other Democratic prospects like Ohio Rep. Tim Ryan, former Missouri Secretary of State Jason Kander and former Maryland Gov. Martin O\u2019Malley have all visited the state. Meanwhile, other potential candidates are taking policy stances that align them more closely with Sanders. New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand, for example, supports \u201cMedicare-for-all\u201d single-payer health insurance \u2013 and Democrats increasingly believe such a program will be a central focus of the 2020 primary. Progressives who ripped Obamacare find themselves fighting to defend it Iowa Democrats say they see Sanders as intent to steer the party\u2019s 2020 dialogue toward his core issues \u2013 and keeping up a front-runner\u2019s appearances, whether he runs or not, allows him to do that. Sanders has said it\u2019s too early to answer questions about whether he will run for president again in 2020. \u201cI am not taking it off the table. I just have not made any decisions. And I think it\u2019s much too early,\u201d Sanders told SiriusXM\u2019s Mark Thompson last week, while insisting Democrats face more urgent fights against Trump. \u201cIt just too early to be talking about an election three and a half years from now.\u201d Still, Sanders has, through phone calls, trips and in his own small ways, continued to cultivate a relationship with progressives in the state. One of those small ways: Instead of bolting from the stage, as he usually does after speeches, Sanders lingered Saturday, shaking hands and taking pictures. Fears pointed out that \u201cif you notice in a lot of his videos, there are a lot of people from Iowa. There are scenes from Iowa. So I think he does have a connection because he has been here so many times.\u201d Chris Laursen, the president of the United Auto Workers Local 74 and a Sanders delegate from Iowa at the 2016 Democratic National Convention, lost an election to become the state party\u2019s labor caucus chair this year and said he\u2019ll run again in 2018. \u201cWe have almost enough Berners to hold the majority. It\u2019s real close,\u201d he said. \u201cInstead of being an outsider coming in, we\u2019ve got a seat at the table now,\u201d Laursen said. \u201cAnd we\u2019re gonna take over the table.\u201d",

            "article_content": "GOP senators are leaving town unsure which of two health care plans will have a vote Republicans currently don't appear to have enough votes to advance either plan As Republican senators prepared to make their familiar dash to airports and train stations Thursday evening, many were in agreement: We have no clue what is happening with Obamacare repeal next week. At the end of a chaotic work week in Washington, senator after senator interviewed by CNN said they were unsure about the status of a health care vote that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell announced earlier in the week. Lawmakers wondered out loud whether there would be a vote \u2013 and more importantly, what, exactly, they would be voting on. Alaska Sen. Lisa Murkowski was asked by a reporter Wednesday night as she exited a health care meeting whether she would oppose a \u201cmotion to proceed\u201d vote \u2013 a procedural hurdle that must be cleared to kick off debate on a bill on the Senate floor. \u201cWe don\u2019t know what the motion to proceed is to. That\u2019s the concern. To proceed to what?\u201d Murkowski said. \u201cTo the BCRA? To the repeal? What the House bill is? We don\u2019t know what the motion to proceed is.\u201d Posed with the same question Thursday morning, Nevada Sen. Dean Heller told CNN that he was simply \u201cnot in a position\u201d to offer an answer because \u201cI have no idea what that motion is going to be part of.\u201d Speaking to reporters Thursday afternoon, Majority Whip Sen. John Cornyn downplayed questions about widespread confusion. \u201cThis wanting to know before you start voting what the final product is going to look like is strange,\u201d Cornyn said, in an apparent reference to the open amendment process that would take place if the motion to proceed vote is successful. The BCRA that Murkowski mentioned refers to the Better Care Reconciliation Act \u2013 legislation to repeal and replace parts of the Affordable Care Act that the House passed in May. As John McCain faces his own fight, his colleagues forge ahead on health care But when too many Republican senators came out against a Senate version of the BCRA, McConnell pulled the plug on that bill this week. He announced, instead, that there would be a procedural vote early next week aimed at considering a repeal-only measure that Republicans passed in 2015 and was vetoed by former President Barack Obama. \u201cRegretfully, it is now apparent that the effort to repeal and immediately replace the failure of Obamacare will not be successful,\u201d McConnell said late Monday. But that plan drew swift opposition \u2013 including from President Donald Trump. In surprising remarks from the White House Wednesday, Trump told senators he wanted them to focus on a repeal-and-replace strategy, despite having tweeted as recently as Monday that it was time for Republicans to just repeal Obamacare. Republicans should just REPEAL failing ObamaCare now & work on a new Healthcare Plan that will start from a clean slate. Dems will join in! Senators openly acknowledged that the President\u2019s unexpected comments shifted the dialogue. \u201cThe President\u2019s being adamant about (doing) replace probably changes the dynamics as to what we vote on,\u201d Sen. Bill Cassidy said on CNN Thursday, before acknowledging: \u201cWe have to wait and see what that is.\u201d Asked whether he would support a repeal-only bill next week, the Louisiana senator punted: \u201cWhat I know now is not what I will know on Monday.\u201d Senators will technically be voting to take up the House-passed bill, but what is unclear is what they will replace it with. Senators wonder if there will be a consensus plan by the time the vote happens. For senators concerned about the bill, agreeing to begin debate without having consensus on a replacement would be a leap of faith they might not want to take because once the Senate is debating the bill, there will be enormous pressure for them to vote \u201cyes\u201d on final passage. McConnell, meanwhile, is emphasizing that as long as the motion to proceed vote is successful, any senator could offer any amendment on the Senate floor. But the reality remains that Republicans currently don\u2019t appear to have enough votes to advance either plan. As repeal and replace falters, more say GOP should abandon repeal plan And, with shocking news of Arizona Republican Sen. John McCain\u2019s brain cancer diagnosis, the majority may be down a valuable vote for the foreseeable future. Over the weekend, conversations are expected to continue over what bill Republicans should actually put up on the floor. Leaders are trying to figure out if additional money could be used to quell the concerns of moderates senators. The head of Medicare and Medicaid at the Health and Human Services Department, Seema Verma, continues to talk to moderates to try and address their issues, according to multiple GOP aides. Verma met with Sens. Rob Portman of Ohio, Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia, John Hoeven of North Dakota and Dean Heller of Nevada on Wednesday. She also met with Alaska Sen. Dan Sullivan on Thursday, according to a Sullivan aide. In recent days, the CBO has also kept reporters and members guessing. The independent scoring agency released two scores: one on an updated score of the 2015 repeal-only bill, and another on a revised version of the Senate\u2019s repeal and replace bill. Some confused Senate aides even turned to reporters for clarity. \u201cAre we voting on (motion to proceed) next week?\u201d one GOP aide asked a CNN reporter in the middle of a discussion about health care. \u201cI honestly don\u2019t know. Do you?\u201d The US Chamber of Commerce responded to the events of the week with an open letter to Congress on Thursday, saying that while the business group would still like to see a health care vote, members should turn their attention to tax reform. \u201cThe challenge of governing requires a willingness to step beyond looking for reasons to oppose things to finding reasons to support policies that are good for the country,\u201d Chamber President Thomas J. Donohue wrote in the letter, adding the group\u2019s endorsements in the 2018 election will focus on lawmakers who are willing to try to reach consensus in order to move legislation. \u201cThe time has long since passed to get to \u201cyes\u201d on healthcare, tax reform, and infrastructure investment.\u201d This story has been updated.

            "article_content": "Republicans are worried what it means to have few legislative wins by August recess Strategists say the party hasn't done enough with its majorities to keep voters engaged Ten Democrats in states Trump won in 2016 up for re-election in 2018 Sen. Dean Heller has carefully avoided endorsing a politically unpopular Republican health care bill. But, with the two sitting next to each other at a White House lunch Wednesday, President Donald Trump suggested Heller would face much graver consequences if he opposes a last-ditch effort to pass that bill. Doing so, Trump said, would amount to \u201ctelling America that you\u2019re fine with Obamacare.\u201d \u201cLook, he wants to remain a senator, doesn\u2019t he?\u201d Trump said of Heller. The Nevada senator is among the most endangered Republicans headed into the 2018 midterm elections. And Trump\u2019s comment was an acknowledgment of the peril facing the GOP if it fails to deliver on its seven-year promise of repealing former President Barack Obama\u2019s Affordable Care Act. Already facing an energized Democratic opposition, Republicans are now confronting the prospect of a deeply disappointed conservative base that has watched the party fall short on health care despite controlling the House, Senate and presidency. In recent days and weeks, Trump has repeatedly claimed that if Republicans did nothing, voters would continue to punish Democrats over Obamacare. But his moment with Heller was a much different message. Donald Trump threatened Dean Heller on health care. Heller was sitting next to him. In the first six months of Trump\u2019s presidency, the party has confirmed Neil Gorsuch as a Supreme Court justice. But it has achieved none of its other major promises. Asked how he would explain the defeat of health care to frustrated Republican voters, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said this week: \u201cWell, we have a new Supreme Court justice. We have 14 repeals of regulations. And we\u2019re only six months into it. Last time I looked, Congress goes on for two years.\u201d Republican lawmakers who opposed the House and Senate bills gambled that voters would punish the party less for passing no bill at all than for passing an unpopular one. But other lawmakers and strategists say the party hasn\u2019t done enough with its majorities to keep voters engaged. \u201cThe fact is, the American people expect us to move three or four big issues like health care, like tax reform,\u201d said Rep. Tom MacArthur of New Jersey, the Republican who was central to crafting the House\u2019s health care bill. \u201cIf we fail on those things, I don\u2019t care how many singles we hit \u2013 it\u2019s not going to be enough,\u201d MacArthur said. For Republicans in the Senate, the window for major accomplishment is narrowing rapidly. The 2018 midterms should be a banner year, with 10 Democrats in states Trump won in 2016 up for re-election and making for ripe targets, while only two Republicans \u2013 Heller and Arizona Sen. Jeff Flake \u2013 appear to be in serious jeopardy. Trump's White House is recruiting primary challengers against Republican Sen. Jeff Flake But after 2018 comes a much more difficult 2020 cycle, in which Republicans will be defending twice as many seats as Democrats, including some in swing states \u2013 such as Maine Sen. Susan Collins (if she doesn\u2019t run for governor), Colorado Sen. Cory Gardner, Iowa Sen. Joni Ernst and North Carolina Sen. Thom Tillis. \u201cWhen we ran for election we told our supporters, our voters, that we were going to repeal Obamacare and replace it (with) something better,\u201d Wisconsin Republican Sen. Ron Johnson told CNN. \u201cAnd I think we take that commitment very seriously.\u201d On the House side, the sense of urgency comes from Democrats\u2019 sense that the 24 seats they need to take control of the chamber could be within reach in 2018. Causing further alarm for Republicans: A new Washington Post-ABC News poll found that 52% of registered voters want Democrats to control the next Congress, while just 38% want Republicans to remain in charge. Facing their failure on Capitol Hill, Republicans have increasingly attempted to shift the terms of the health care debate by seizing on a measure Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders soon plans to introduce that would shift the United States toward a single-payer \u201cMedicare for all\u201d system. Their hope: Republicans can convince voters to look past their own failure by attacking Obamacare\u2019s effectiveness and posit that Democrats would go much farther in remaking the nation\u2019s health system. The silver lining in the Post-ABC poll for the GOP is that their voters remain more engaged in non-presidential cycles than Democratic voters. The poll found that 72% of adults who strongly approve of Trump and 65% who identify themselves as Republicans say they are likely to vote in the midterm elections, compared to 57% of Democrats. Still, Republican National Committee chairwoman Ronna Romney McDaniel signed an email to supporters Wednesday that took aim at some fellow Republicans. The subject line: \u201cNot what you voted for\u2026\u201d In it, she complained that \u201csome in the Senate are refusing to even put a simple repeal bill on (Trump\u2019s) desk.\u201d \u201cAs your RNC Chairwoman, it\u2019s my job to represent you, fight for you, and make sure your voice is heard loud and clear,\u201d Romney McDaniel said. \u201cThat\u2019s why I\u2019ve gone on TV to say that if our elected officials don\u2019t pass what you voted for, we could lose the midterm elections.\u201d",

            "article_content": "GOP looks to vote on a bill next week, but they're not close to a deal Senate recess extended until mid-August Republican senators were no closer to a health care deal on Tuesday after the surprise decision to delay the Senate\u2019s summer recess and as a bombshell revelation about Donald Trump Jr. hung over Capitol Hill. GOP senators had hoped to finally get some clarity on the fate of their bill to overhaul Obamacare, after last week\u2019s Independence Day recess deepened some lawmakers\u2019 reservations about the proposal. Instead, members arrived at a weekly lunch meeting to a chaotic scene where swarms of reporters peppered senators with questions about the news that President Donald Trump\u2019s eldest son had agreed to meet with a Russian last year after being promised sensitive information that would \u201cincriminate\u201d Hillary Clinton. Donald Trump Jr. releases email chain on his Russian meeting Two hours later, Republicans still didn\u2019t know how the health care bill would be revised \u2013 and GOP leaders insisted that there would be a procedural vote next week. Adding confusion to the already muddled deliberations over the health care legislation, some senators said Tuesday afternoon that they were led to believe they might see two sets of draft bills and revised reports from the non-partisan Congressional Budget Office, while another veteran Republican declared that he was working on a separate proposal of his own. Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Kentucky, decided to add two more weeks until the traditional August recess starts, extending the time senators have to work on health care \u2013 but with no guarantee that it will amount to anything. Meanwhile, Sen. Lindsey Graham told reporters that he and several other colleagues were in drafting a health care proposal that would likely be introduced as an amendment to the current bill. \u201cI want to do the best I can and I think the best we can is not on the table right now,\u201d the South Carolina Republican said. While Graham himself would not share details of his plan, one senior Democratic aide said Graham had reached out to some Democrats on a potential bipartisan approach. Asked if that was a bad sign for leadership\u2019s efforts to shore up support for their bill, Texas Sen. John Cornyn, the Senate\u2019s majority whip, acknowledged: \u201cIt means this is hard.\u201d While GOP leaders emphasized that decisions were still being made about what provisions will make it into a final bill, Cornyn said he expects $45 billion in extra funding to battle the opioid addiction epidemic \u2013 a key demand of Republicans Rob Portman of Ohio and Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia \u2013 would make it into the bill. He also said two Obamacare taxes on affluent Americans \u2013 one a Medicare payroll tax surcharge and the other on investments \u2013 that Republicans had initially wanted to repeal, will likely stay in place. Those funds would go to \u201cthe innovation and stabilization fund to try to give governors the ability to get premiums lower and deductibles lower,\u201d he added. Even with these changes, Cornyn said, he was unsure whether leaders would get to 50 \u201cyes\u201d votes. Sen. John Thune, R-South Dakota, said winning over rank-and-file members opposed to the bill remained a tough task. \u201cEvery time you kind of move the dial in one direction, you maybe add some new members but lose a couple over here,\u201d Thune said. \u201cRight now we\u2019re just trying to find the sweet spot.\u201d Others leaving the lunch were much more tight-lipped. \u201cI have no comment on anything,\u201d said Sen. Jim Risch, an Idaho Republican. \u201cYou guys have a good day.\u201d Merkley: Conservatives warming to idea of single-payer health insurance Sen. Lisa Murkowski, who has expressed serious concerns about the Senate health care bill, was asked whether any progress was made on issues important to her. She simply responded, \u201cNo.\u201d \u201cYou know we are going to be getting a new one,\u201d the Alaska Republican said when pressed about ongoing problems with the legislation. McConnell said his decision to delay the start of August\u2019s recess by two weeks was in part to ensure that senators would have time to tackle other legislative priorities after concluding health care. To that end, he is moving full steam ahead with a vote next week, with a draft bill being released on Thursday and an updated CBO score expected early next week. One major sticking point is a proposed amendment from conservative Sen. Ted Cruz. The Texas Republican has been pushing a proposal to give insurers more opportunities to offer plans that don\u2019t comply with Obamacare regulations. But it has drawn criticism from moderates in the conference who worry it could erode protections for people with pre-existing conditions. In recent days, some of Cruz\u2019s colleagues have sounded increasingly skeptical about whether the amendment could help create more support for the health care bill and if it would be included in the final bill at all. \u201cI think it picks up conservatives votes and loses other votes,\u201d Iowa Sen. Chuck Grassley had said Monday. On Tuesday, Cornyn told reporters the proposal was still \u201cin the mix\u201d of revisions being discussed. Meanwhile, Tennessee Sen. Bob Corker said he expects two draft bills \u2013 one with the Cruz amendment and one without \u2013 to be released on Thursday, while Louisiana Sen. Bill Cassidy said leadership suggested two CBO scores would be released early next week. What was supposed to be a clarifying day on health care instead turned into yet another day consumed by Russian meddling in the 2016 election, with mobs of reporters clamoring to know exactly what Republicans planned to do with the latest Donald Trump Jr. revelation. \u201cThese revelations today rise to a level that likely complicates (McConnell\u2019s) health care work given the fact that every one of his senators is going to be getting surrounded like this today,\u201d Democratic Sen. Chris Murphy of Connecticut predicted to a large scrum of reporters in the Senate basement. Source: Justice Dept. probe will look at Trump Jr.'s disclosed emails, meeting Corker, the chairman of the Senate\u2019s foreign relations committee, argued he was doing his best to stay focused on health care and Russia sanctions legislation. \u201cIt\u2019s losing focus, and I\u2019m focused on other things,\u201d Corker said, noting that he was getting blood drawn when he learned about the bombshell news on CNN. Graham insisted, however, that he was not fazed by the latest headline about the Trump campaign \u2013 and that it would not distract him from health care. \u201cI can do two things at once,\u201d he said.

            "article_content": "\"What I'm hearing is the system is way too stressful,\" Sen. Jeff Merkley said Congressional Republicans have given no indication that they would consider such legislation A Democratic senator said Tuesday that his conservative constituents are warming to the idea of universal government-run insurance, which has long been a policy goal of progressives. \u201cWhat I\u2019m hearing \u2013 even in these conservative parts of my state that I lost by 30, 40% when I was running for re-election \u2013 what I\u2019m hearing is the system is way too stressful,\u201d Sen. Jeff Merkley told CNN\u2019s Alisyn Camerota during a discussion on health care legislation on \u201cNew Day.\u201d \u201cI\u2019ve been asking each audience, I\u2019ve been saying, \u2018How many people here 10 years ago would have supported a single-payer Medicare-for-all?\u2019 And it\u2019s a small number. And then I ask, \u2018How many now?\u2019 And the hands just go up throughout the room.\u201d Merkley added, \u201cPeople are so stressed about the complexity and difficulty of our health care system. Can\u2019t we make this simpler?\u201d Merkley\u2019s Republican colleagues in Congress, however, have given no indication that they would consider legislation to create a single-payer health insurance program. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Tuesday that a single-payer health care plan similar to the one championed by Sen. Bernie Sanders during his presidential campaign \u201cwould strip Americans of so many facets of decision-making over their own health-care and hand it to the government.\u201d Merkley was on \u201cNew Day\u201d to discuss the Senate GOP\u2019s health care bill, which includes proposals to eliminate the taxes imposed on high-income Americans to help pay for an expansion of health benefits under the Affordable Care Act.

            "article_content": "The Senate's stab at \"repeal and replace\" gets more time The President's latest pitch is a change from the trail President Donald Trump is frustrated. His promise to \u201crepeal and replace\u201d Obamacare is on the rocks, again, thanks to divisions in the Senate Republican ranks, and emboldened Democrats are circling the wagons to protect the law. On Friday morning, he awoke to fling a new wrench into already tense negotiations. \u201cIf Republican Senators are unable to pass what they are working on now,\u201d Trump tweeted, \u201cthey should immediately REPEAL, and then REPLACE at a later date!\u201d If Republican Senators are unable to pass what they are working on now, they should immediately REPEAL, and then REPLACE at a later date! The message represented yet another twist in the long series of contradictions that mark his ever-shifting prescription for health care. Progressives who ripped Obamacare find themselves fighting to defend it In January Trump told the New York Times that he wanted Obamacare upended immediately and a replacement prepped and ready \u201cquickly or simultaneously, very shortly thereafter.\u201d The remark effectively dismissed out of hand a suggestion \u2013 much like the one he made on Friday \u2013 that Republicans could \u201crepeal and delay,\u201d or take their time in crafting a new plan. It wasn\u2019t the first time Trump very clearly rejected the notion of any health care layover. \u201cWe\u2019re going to do it simultaneously,\u201d he said during a long interview on CBS\u2019s \u201c60 Minutes\u201d after the election. \u201cIt\u2019ll be just fine. We\u2019re not going to have, like, a two-day period and we\u2019re not going to have a two-year period where there\u2019s nothing.\u201d But the most glaring difference between what Trump touted on the trail and what the Senate bill might deliver involves Medicaid, a program he pledged to protect, along with Medicare and Social Security, while warning that other Republican candidates might not. The Republicans who want to cut SS & Medicaid are wrong. A robust economy will Make America Great Again! https://t.co/u25yI5T7E8 \u201cThe Republicans who want to cut SS & Medicaid are wrong,\u201d he tweeted on July 11, 2015, a few weeks into his campaign. In May of that year, before announcing his candidacy, Trump told The Daily Signal, a conservative website, \u201cI\u2019m not going to cut Social Security like every other Republican and I\u2019m not going to cut Medicare or Medicaid.\u201d The irony, two years on, is that Republicans \u2013 in the House and Senate \u2013 are indeed pushing to cut Medicaid spending. And the President seems to be going along. Trump has denied the spending cuts equal a cut to the program, but as CNNMoney\u2019s Tami Luhby made clear in her recent report, \u201cthe Congressional Budget Office says the Senate bill would reduce federal spending on Medicaid by a total of $772 billion by 2026, and the House\u2019s legislation by $834 billion over that time.\u201d The CBO, a nonpartisan agency, has estimated that the House and Senate bills would, respectively, lead to 23 and 22 million people losing insurance \u2013 in comparison to the numbers expected under current law \u2013 over the next ten years. Why Obamacare is here to stay, even as GOP strives for repeal Trump, though, famously told the Washington Post in mid-January that his Obamacare replacement would effectively provide universal coverage. \u201cWe\u2019re going to have insurance for everybody,\u201d he told reporters. \u201cThere was a philosophy in some circles that if you can\u2019t pay for it, you don\u2019t get it. That\u2019s not going to happen with us.\u201d Except that, according to the plans Republicans are now pushing, it will. Trump must sense this as he has twice now referred to the GOP health care plan as \u201cmean.\u201d When former President Barack Obama derided what he called its  \u201cfundamental meanness\u201d in a Facebook post, Trump actually responded by reminding Fox News that he used the language first. \u201cWell, (Obama) actually used my term, \u2018mean.\u2019 That was my term,\u201d Trump said. \u201cBecause I want to see \u2013 and I speak from the heart \u2013 that\u2019s what I want to see, I want to see a bill with heart.\u201d The photos House Republicans are really going to regret taking Those comments marked a jarring about-face from his initial reaction to its passage on May 4, when he called the bill \u201ca great plan\u201d during a celebratory gathering with House Republicans in the White House Rose Garden. Senate Republicans, however, facing the prospect of an unpopular vote much like their House colleagues nearly two months ago, have revolted against Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell\u2019s proposal. All of which set the stage for Trump\u2019s endorsement Friday of repealing Obamacare and then replacing it later \u2013 the very thing he so publicly rejected months earlier.",

            "article_content": "Two weeks before he left office in January, President Barack Obama was asked why he thought the Affordable Care Act never achieved the level of popularity its early backers predicted. Obama was typically circumspect, assigning out blame both to intransigent congressional Republicans and, as he described it to the Vox panel, a \u201cdissatisfied column\u201d of people headlined by a \u201cwhole bunch of Bernie Sanders supporters who want a single-payer plan.\u201d \u201cThe problem is not that they think (the ACA) is a failure,\u201d Obama said. \u201cThe problem is that they don\u2019t think it went far enough.\u201d On this point, Obama was correct. Sanders and his progressive allies wanted more from the original bill, in particular a \u201cpublic option,\u201d or government-run alternative to private insurance plans. But with Democrats in early 2010 running up against a mirror of the internal divisions now slowing Republican efforts to gut the law, progressives eventually stood down and voted for it. Fast forward more than seven years and, despite their misgivings about the current law and ongoing push for a more robust national health care system, Sanders, activists committed to his political program, and leftist political organizations like the Democratic Socialists of America are on the front lines defending Obamacare. Anti-Trumpcare rally w/ @DemSocialists @dc_dsa pic.twitter.com/m4k47rat8y The pushback against that legislation has been the most diverse and broad \u201cresistance\u201d action of the Trump era. Groups fundamentally opposed to the structure of Obamacare, which at its core effectively requires that individuals buy private, if partially subsidized health insurance, have marched and backed sit-ins alongside others who support the law with little reservation. Sanders last weekend headlined a barnstorming tour of three states \u2013 Pennsylvania, Ohio and West Virginia \u2013 carried by President Donald Trump last year, each home to Republican senators who had publicly expressed doubts about the GOP bill or secretive working group in which it was authored. In his speeches \u2013 tight, half-hour screeds against what he described as \u201ca barbaric and immoral piece of legislation\u201d \u2013 Sanders warned that \u201cmany, many thousands of our fellow Americans will die\u201d if it succeeded. That line of attack has drawn criticism from the right, but Sanders on Wednesday dismissed the blowback, pointing to a Politifact assessment that interrogated the claim and rated it mostly true, and asserted again that the potential outcome was \u201cpretty obvious.\u201d \u201cEveryone is saying, we have a lot of anger in politics today and we have a lot of people shouting at each other and worse, but what you cannot run away from are simple facts,\u201d he told CNN.  \u201cI am quite sure there is no Republican who wants to see anybody in America die unnecessarily, no one is happy about that. But these are the facts that people have got to take responsibility for the legislation that they produce.\u201d Protesters dragged away from senator's office \u201cWe are not willing to sacrifice 22 million peoples\u2019 health care to make a political point,\u201d said Maria Svart, national director of Democratic Socialists of America, among the most vocal organized proponents of moving to single-payer health care. The group\u2019s ranks have swelled in the months since the election, with more than 16,000 of its 23,000 dues-paying members joining over the last eight months. Svart views the ongoing fight to protect Obamacare as a necessary step in building the coalitions that will, in the coming months and years, force elected officials to embrace single-payer, or risk losing broad liberal support. Keeping people engaged in this fight, she said, will build energy and good will to launch the next one. \u201cWe are out there organizing, and we know that people who hope are stronger than people who feel helpless,\u201d she said in an email. \u201cThe bonds formed in collective struggle are difficult to tear apart.\u201d Activists protest GOP health care bill on Capitol Hill The question of trust is especially relevant in a Democratic Party and progressive left \u2013 the latter with one foot in, one out of the tent \u2013 roiled less by intractable policy disputes than lingering grievances over the 2016 primary process and questions over how to unlock the Republican grip on Congress. Jon Ossoff\u2019s defeat in Georgia\u2019s congressional special election was a tipping point. In the 24 hours after he fell short in the most expensive House race ever, Democrats almost uniformly acknowledged that the party needed to craft a more compelling economic message and not simply expect moderate Republicans to come turn their backs on the GOP over Trump\u2019s assorted foibles. If the Democrats succeed in defeating the Senate health care bill \u2013 which, despite its recent setback, is still very much in play \u2013 it will be in large part because opponents, from elected officials to \u201cresistance\u201d activists, focused on the issue at hand and mostly eschewed gratuitous shots at the White House. \u201cThis fight is reminding Democrats what the Democratic Party is for,\u201d Ben Wikler, MoveOn\u2019s Washington director, told CNN. \u201cThe point of having a Democratic Party is to fight against laws that would take away people\u2019s health care to fund tax credits for rich people.\u201d Was outside the US Capitol to show GOP we won\u2019t stand by while they try to pass a bill that would leave 22M more Americans uninsured by 2026 pic.twitter.com/ICYHdFYwk4 The rabble-rousers on the left seem to agree. Our Revolution, the political organization spawned by Sanders\u2019 primary campaign, Democracy Spring, #AllOfUs, and DSA are among the groups planning further protests \u2013 including a round of \u201cnonviolent sit-ins across the country\u201d next Thursday \u2013 against the Republican bill. All support single-payer health care and typically operate outside the sphere of party politics. #AllOfUs, a millennial group, launched an effort in February to bolster progressive primary challengers to elected Democrats \u201cwho won\u2019t do everything in their power to resist Trump.\u201d Neera Tanden, president of the Center for American Progress and a longtime adviser to Hillary Clinton, frequently jousts with more aggressive progressive activists, often Sanders supporters, on Twitter. Still, she praised his work in defense of Obamacare without reservation. \u201cI think it\u2019s great what he\u2019s doing and I respect the fact that he supports single-payer but he\u2019s not using his support for single payer to weaken the ACA right now,\u201d she told CNN. \u201cThere are some voices that have criticized (from) the left on the ACA and I think that Sen. Sanders\u2019 refusal to do that has been really important.\u201d Whether this d\u00e9tente will outlive what one activist described as a \u201cfive-alarm fire\u201d is a more complicated question. \u201cIt sometimes is easier to cohere when you are the party out of power, especially in fights like this,\u201d said David Axelrod, a former top adviser to President Obama and CNN senior political commentator. \u201cIn battles with the Republicans on core issues like health care, there will be a coming together. It doesn\u2019t mean that when primary battles come that factional differences won\u2019t resurface.\u201d The divide could re-open sooner than that. Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren, in an interview with The Wall Street Journal this week, called single-payer \u201cthe next step.\u201d New York Sen. Kirsten Gillibrand is on board too. Sanders said he will unveil new Medicare-for-all legislation in the coming weeks, \u201csoon after this debate is over.\u201d Those proposals seem might seem audacious at this particular moment, when Democrats control nothing in Washington. But they represent a down payment to the voters and progressive activists working to return the party to power in 2018 and 2020. Asked if he thought his current, full-throated defense of Obamacare might earn his message a second look from Democrats skeptical of the messenger, or embittered by the 2016 campaign, Sanders demurred. \u201cThat may well be the case, but that\u2019s not my purpose right now,\u201d he said. If the current fight in California over a statewide single-payer bill is any indication, the era of intra-party good feelings seems destined to be short-lived. Protests in support of the legislation, passed by Democrats in the state senate but tabled by Democratic Assembly Speaker Anthony Rendon, are ramping up. (Sanders said in a statement last week that he was \u201cextremely disappointed\u201d by the decision.) What happens to politicians that deny 39 million people #SinglePayer healthcare for all?Ask CA Democrat @Rendon63rd.INACTION = DEATH \ud83d\udc80 pic.twitter.com/ZlooRQGLw8 But MoveOn\u2019s Wikler, who took turns at the mic rallying crowds ahead of Sanders\u2019 speeches during their weekend swing, offered some qualified optimism \u2013 if not for any particular bill, than the conversations that lie ahead. \u201cIf Democrats retake power,\u201d he said, \u201cthe idea of a public option and Medicare-for-all are going to be a much easier sell because Democrats stood shoulder-to-shoulder in the fight today.\u201d",

In the special elections for House seats vacated by Republicans who wound up in President Donald Trump\u2019s Cabinet, Democrats went 0-for-4. Now, party officials, strategists and candidates are pondering what went wrong \u2013 and how they can turn it around in time for the 2018 midterm elections.

The losses aren\u2019t all doom and gloom for Democrats. The party got closer than it has in decades to winning some of the four seats \u2013 a sign they\u2019ve closed their gaps with Republicans in both suburban and rural areas and in 2018 will have a broad playing field with dozens of more competitive districts. \u201cWe have to remember that these elections are being held in districts hand-picked by Trump \u2013 districts where he created vacancies because he thought they were \u2018can\u2019t lose\u2019 seats,\u201d said Ron Klain, a Democratic operative who was chief of staff to vice presidents Joe Biden and Al Gore. RELATED: In Georgia, close isn\u2019t nearly good enough for Democrats Democrats also came closer than expected in South Carolina on Tuesday \u2013 which, Klain said, \u201cshows there are no safe seats for Republicans and the Democrats have a broad array of districts to contest.\u201d But before the 2018 midterms, Democrats must grapple with the party\u2019s need to drive its base to the polls while also convincing some independents and moderate Republicans to reject Trump. \u201cDemocrats haven\u2019t figured out how to beat Trump,\u201d a senior Trump administration official said Tuesday night. Republican Karen Handel wins Georgia House special election After scoring their latest victories, Republicans were spiking the football. Kellyanne Conway, a top White House aide, jabbed at Ossoff for being 30 years old and living just outside Georgia\u2019s 6th District, tweeting her thanks to Republican Karen Handel \u201cfor standing strong, for running on issues, for being a grownup and for living in the district.\u201d In a memo, National Republican Congressional Committee communications director Matt Gorman said Democrats have a \u201ccompetence problem\u201d and said there were no moral victories to be had. \u201cFawning press stories or bluster doesn\u2019t win a single vote. There comes a time where a party must put up or shut up,\u201d he said in the memo. Democrats, meanwhile, were left licking their wounds. \u201cThere are two ways to digest this result for Democrats \u2013 with our brains and with our guts,\u201d said Tom Bonier, a top Democratic data and targeting guru. Besting previous Democratic marks in each district that held a special election is a reason for optimism, he said. \u201cBut instinctually, this hurts, because it was about more than a single seat,\u201d Bonier said. \u201cIt was an opportunity to throw a wrench into Republican recruiting and fundraising efforts for 2018; to potentially set off a wave of retirements, creating easier to win open seats,\u201d he said. \u201cLogically, the difference of a few thousand votes in a single special election shouldn\u2019t have such an impact. But these decisions aren\u2019t always made based on logic alone.\u201d Rep. Joe Crowley of New York, the House Democratic Caucus chairman, said in a statement that Georgia represented \u201ca tough loss.\u201d \u201cBut Democrats cannot let this defeat tamper our enthusiasm. The fight to defeat President Trump\u2019s and the Republican majority\u2019s extreme agenda is more important than ever,\u201d he said. First, though, Democrats seem poised for a round of battles over which types of candidates they should run in competitive districts. Progressive activist groups were sharply critical of Ossoff\u2019s moderate campaign. In a strategic decision aimed at courting moderate Republicans who had supported Hillary Clinton in the fall, Ossoff rarely mentioned Trump\u2019s name, and Democrats only hit Handel on the GOP\u2019s health care effort late in the race. \u201cGone are the days of Blue Dogs who actively campaign as Republicans,\u201d said Adam Green, the co-founder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee. Democracy for America chair Jim Dean blasted the Democratic establishment\u2019s \u201cunforced errors.\u201d Anna Galland, the executive director of MoveOn.org, said Ossoff and the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee \u201cmissed an opportunity to make Republicans\u2019 attack on health care the key issue, and instead attempted to portray Ossoff as a centrist, focusing on cutting spending and coming out in opposition to Medicare-for-all.\u201d Dan Pfeiffer, a long-time senior aide to former President Barack Obama, tweeted that Democrats need a \u201cprogressive populist candidate\u201d focused on the economy and the GOP\u2019s health care effort to win tough House races. And I don't think those things are in conflict, bc a progressive populist candidate focused on the economy and AHCA can do both And while Democrats badly wanted a win, coming close four times should be enough to spook Republicans facing competitive re-election battles, said Zac Petkanas, who ran Hillary Clinton\u2019s rapid response team. \u201cThe fact that all these races were close should have any member of the GOP who won by less than 15 points absolutely terrified,\u201d he said. Democratic voters nationwide, Petkanas said, don\u2019t know Ossoff. \u201cThey all know who Donald Trump is and this race proves he remains a major liability for Republicans that juices our turnout and depresses their support,\u201d he said. Ossoff was catapulted to progressive stardom \u2013 and turned into a fundraising phenom who hauled in $23 million \u2013 in large part due to early support from the liberal blog Daily Kos. The blog\u2019s founder, Markos Moulitsas, said in an email that the loss was \u201cobviously disappointing.\u201d But, he said, in competing hard in places like Georgia\u2019s 6th District, where former Rep. Tom Price never fell below 60%, Democrats have changed the expectations for the 2018 midterms. \u201cWe\u2019ve made it a point to fight Republicans every step of the way, make them earn every inch of territory they\u2019ve gained. We\u2019ve taken the fight deep into their territory, and forced them to fight desperately to hold seats that should easily be theirs. We\u2019ve laid a marker on the ground \u2013 next year will be brutal for Republicans, because they won\u2019t be able to spend tens of millions in every district,\u201d Moulitsas said. \u201cWe\u2019re going to keep fighting them, keep harassing them, and keep expanding the map,\u201d he said. \u201cAnd in the end, we\u2019ll know who really won and who lost November of 2018.\u201d",

            "article_content": "Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe's brand was likely enhanced by events of this week And Sen. Chris Murphy says he's not interested, in case you were curious Sen. Kamala Harris was shushed, once again, by colleagues on her committee A new player is making his way onto 2020 Democratic watch lists this week: Ohio Rep. Tim Ryan. Check his travel schedule: Ryan is headed to South Carolina on Saturday to campaign for Archie Parnell ahead of Tuesday\u2019s special election for a House seat. The following weekend, Ryan will give a commencement address at the Maharishi University of Management in Fairfield, Iowa, on Saturday. (The university uses meditation in the classroom; Ryan practices daily yoga and meditation.) Then he\u2019ll be in Polk County for an event Sunday at Cooney\u2019s Pub. Two early state trips in two weekends is enough to kick up some speculation \u2014 even if Ryan, who ran against Nancy Pelosi for the top House Democratic post in the fall, is an unlikely presidential contender. Ryan does, however, represent a constituency in Youngstown that Democrats need to win back. And he was a contender for Hillary Clinton\u2019s vice presidential nod. (Spot him in the background here.) A word of caution about Ryan: He\u2019s flirted with higher office before only to ultimately decline to run. He just passed on a run for Ohio governor in 2018. Another big week for Harris: California Sen. Kamala Harris was shushed, once again, by Senate intelligence chairman Richard Burr, this time during her rapid-fire grilling of Attorney General Jeff Sessions. These moments are introducing her to Democrats nationally. Some social numbers: Between Tuesday\u2019s hearing and Friday, Harris added more than 64,000 new followers on her official Twitter account and 71,000 on her political Twitter handle. She also picked up 27,000 more Facebook followers by Thursday afternoon. \u2014 Harris is smartly seizing on the new attention of the last two weeks, using it to help endangered senators up in 2018. She used her fundraising list to raise money for Missouri Sen. Claire McCaskill this week. So far this year, Harris has raised $250,000 through mostly online, small-dollar contributions to support colleagues up in 2018 and more than $500,000 for her own political action committee. \u2014 Clip \u2018n save this comment on national television from a frustrated Sessions during Tuesday\u2019s hearing: \u201cI\u2019m not able to be rushed this fast. It makes me nervous.\u201d It\u2019s ready-made for a future Harris ad. \u2014 From the 2020 perspective, one Democratic operative tells me Harris is \u201cvery credible\u201d and will benefit from recent events with women and minority voters \u2014 that is, the Democratic base. Another says the last two weeks are \u201cfeeding rocket fuel to her pathway toward 2020. I don\u2019t know if she wants it, but her star is rising.\u201d Murphy says he\u2019s not running: These sorts of answers have a way of changing over time, but Connecticut Sen. Chris Murphy was asked on Connecticut Public Radio if he is interested in running for president and said, \u201cI\u2019m not.\u201d He added: \u201cI am interested in having a national voice. I am interested in doing that through the United States Senate.\u201d Return of the Macker: Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe\u2019s brand was likely enhanced a bit by his Lieutenant Gov. Ralph Northam\u2019s easier-than-expected Democratic primary win over former Rep. Tom Perriello this week. Northam\u2019s win showed local fundamentals \u2014 particularly the support of local and state Democrats and his status as McAuliffe\u2019s No. 2 \u2014 still matter in an anti-Donald Trump national environment. \u201cShows something to Dems around the country that Dems in VA like TerryISM,\u201d one Democratic operative emailed me on primary night. \u2014 To be clear, McAuliffe, who is publicly flirting with a 2020 run (he told me a few weeks ago he\u2019ll \u201csee what happens\u201d after 2018), isn\u2019t the Democratic governor who\u2019s the subject of the most chatter. New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo, Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper, Montana Gov. Steve Bullock and Washington Gov. Jay Inslee, in particular, are being more closely watched. There are also ex-governors to watch \u2014 including Deval Patrick of Massachusetts. As for McAuliffe, other Democrats note his time as the party\u2019s chairman and top fundraiser would cause headaches. \u201cToo much Clinton. Too insider. Too establishment,\u201d another Democratic operative told me. Merkley books an Iowa trip: Oregon Sen. Jeff Merkley (who CNN\u2019s Ashley Killough just profiled) will headline the Progress Iowa Corn Feed on September 10 along with South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg. Merkley was the only senator to endorse Bernie Sanders last year and is an important behind-the-scenes player with progressive groups. Facebookers talk shooting, baseball game: Facebook\u2019s Mark Zuckerberg weighed in on the Congressional Baseball Game, saying: \u201cIt\u2019s great to see Republicans and Democrats coming together to honor the victims of yesterday\u2019s shooting and use our services to raise money for charity.\u201d So did Sheryl Sandberg, who wrote that she is \u201cpraying that everyone injured recovers quickly and that everyone on the scene will get any help they need to put this trauma behind them. And like many Americans I\u2019m grateful to the US Capitol Police officers for their extraordinary heroism.\u201d Warren hits GOP on health care: Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren criticized Senate Republican leadership today on \u201cCBS This Morning\u201d over its approach to health care, saying 13 men are behind closed doors working on a bill and \u201cwon\u2019t let Democrats in the room to even see the bill.\u201d She also took a swing at Trump, telling GOP senators the House-passed bill was \u201cmean,\u201d noting that \u201cthat\u2019s the same bill that he threw a party for right after it passed.\u201d \u2014 Former Vice President Joe Biden keynotes the Florida Democratic Party\u2019s \u201cLeadership Blue\u201d gala in Hollywood, Florida, on Saturday evening. \u2014 Minnesota Sen. Al Franken will join Colorado Gov. John Hickenlooper from 6 to 10 p.m. MT in Denver on Saturday for an event publicizing Franken\u2019s new memoir. \u2014 Tuesday is the Georgia sixth congressional district special election between Democrat Jon Ossoff and Republican Karen Handel, as well as the South Carolina\u2019s fifth district contest between Parnell and Republican Ralph Norman. Watch for potential 2020 prospects weighing in on these races. \u2014 Biden headlines the DNC\u2019s annual LGBT Gala in New York on Wednesday night. Notes from CNN\u2019s Greg Krieg: \u2014 About last weekend: More than 4,000 activists gathered in Chicago for the second annual People\u2019s Summit. The convention was organized by National Nurses United, the powerful union that backed Sanders from the start and is willing to spend to keep the cause \u2014 and its push for \u201cMedicare-for-all\u201d \u2014 front and center. Attendees were treated to vintage Sanders on Saturday night. A major theme: The Democratic Party, as he put it, had written off traditionally red enclaves and it was time again to \u201cknock on every damn door.\u201d The money line \u2014 which you could and should tie to the forthcoming note on Georgia \u2014 was this: \u201cStrong progressives could do far, far better than anyone imagined and \u2026 with proper organization and financial resources we can win in any district in the United States of America.\u201d \u2014 FYI: As the Berniecrats see it, Ossoff is an empty suit, a (Seinfeld-style) candidate-about-nothing. So if his almost canonical inoffensiveness falls short, brace for a new wave of recriminations from the left. Progressives were not pleased when the DNC didn\u2019t exactly circle the wagons for their guys in Kansas and Montana. Failure in Georgia would be cause for some soul-searching regardless, but it\u2019d also re-up some 2016-ish grievances. \u2014 Overheard at the People\u2019s Summit: \u201cRun as far left as you possibly can, because they\u2019re going to call you a commie anyway.\u201d Exhibit A for this being a fair point comes from Virginia GOP gubernatorial nominee Ed Gillespie, who tweeted Thursday that the fairly moderate Democratic nominee, Northam, \u201cis the most extreme, left-wing candidate ever to run for governor in Virginia.\u201d \u2014 Trump\u2019s \u201cInfrastructure week\u201d was a major bust, but progressive groups are working to seize the issue. The Working Families Party and Progressive Change Campaign Committee are again talking up a congressional resolution from late May that sets \u201c10 principles\u201d for any future infrastructure plan. House Republicans are unlikely to take notice, but you can be sure any potential future Democratic nominee will be asked to sign on \u2014 perhaps literally \u2014 and pledge to make any major infrastructure project a public one. Ohio Sen. Sherrod Brown is up for re-election in 2018 and is already being targeted on tax reform by the Koch brothers\u2019 Americans for Prosperity. \u2026 Warren has been re-upping her calls for Sessions to be fired. \u2026 Tom Steyer is calling on Congress to begin the process of impeaching Trump.

            "article_content": "What's the holdup with Puerto Rico's political status? How could it eventually happen? Could Puerto Rico become the 51st US state? That\u2019s the question of the day after Puerto Ricans voted overwhelmingly for statehood during a nonbinding weekend referendum. There are a few catches, though: Only 23% of eligible citizens voted, and, well, there\u2019s plenty of red tape on the way to becoming a state. Here are the basics: Puerto Rico is officially a US Commonwealth. The island came under US control in 1898 after the Spanish-American War, but it wasn\u2019t until 1952 that Puerto Rico and the United States officially approved a federal law making it a commonwealth. As residents of a US commonwealth, Puerto Ricans: \u2013 Have their own constitution \u2013 Have their own governor \u2013 Only pay federal income tax on work done within the United States \u2013 Pay into Social Security and have access to Medicare and Medicaid, but not some other government programs \u2013 Do not have a vote in the US Congress \u2013 Can vote in presidential primary elections, but not in presidential elections \u2013 Are natural-born US citizens It is also worth a note that there are a million more Puerto Ricans who live in the mainland United States than live in Puerto Rico. After this weekend\u2019s election, Puerto Rico Gov. Ricardo Rossell\u00f3 said statehood voters were \u201cclaiming [their] equal rights as American citizens.\u201d However, it goes deeper than that. Puerto Rico is in an economic crisis. The commonwealth filed for municipal bankruptcy in May, and is in the hole for $70 billion owed to various creditors. Poverty is rampant, unemployment is high \u2013 11.5% \u2013 and statehood supporters, including Rossell\u00f3, say the move could boost Puerto Rico\u2019s economy. This is far from the first time the question of statehood has been posed to the Puerto Rican people, and it hasn\u2019t always been so popular. Votes were held in 1967, 1991,1993, 1998 and 2012. The 2012 referendum was the first time the popular vote swung in statehood\u2019s favor. Since these votes were nonbinding referendums, no action had to be taken, and indeed, no action was. At the time, political analysts said the 2012 vote didn\u2019t necessarily indicate an overwhelming desire for statehood, but rather an overwhelming desire for a status change in general, whether it be statehood, independence or some other solution. It\u2019s Congress\u2019 call. To become the 51st state, Congress would have to pass a statute to admit Puerto Rico as a state, and conversations around that possibility have obviously been going on for decades. The generalities of this process are found in the \u201cNew States\u201d clause in the US Constitution. Every state after the original 13 colonies has been admitted under this directive.  After the vote, Rossello said in a statement that he will visit Washington soon and plead his case for statehood. However, the election\u2019s numbers may stifle his argument. At first glance, it may look like statehood claimed a victory with this weekend\u2019s vote. However, the numbers tell a different story. According to the State Electoral Commission, 518,000 people voted, which represents 23% of eligible voters. For comparison, in 2012, 1.8 million people voted, which was a turnout of 77.5%. So even though the statehood vote \u201cwon,\u201d 300,000 fewer people voted for that option this year than in 2012. Why the low turnout? Before the election, opposition parties encouraged citizens to refrain from voting, saying the election was \u201crigged\u201d because of the way the ballot was worded. An earlier version of the ballot was rejected by federal officials in April because it didn\u2019t offer an option for voters to indicate they wanted Puerto Rico to stay a commonwealth. Additionally, the Department of Justice pointed out the earlier version of the ballot was \u201cpotentially misleading\u201d because it implied statehood was the \u201conly option\u201d for Puerto Ricans to gain  American citizenship (in fact, Puerto Ricans are US citizens by birth). The ballot was revised after these criticisms, but the skepticism in Puerto Rico remained. Again, this latest vote was a \u201cnonbinding referendum,\u201d so nothing really HAS to happen next. But now there is going to be another vote in October. It\u2019s all about convincing Congress, so if the turnout is better and the support is still high, Puerto Rican leaders and statehood supporters will have an even stronger case to lay before Congress.",

            "article_content": "Trump and House Republicans kept talking even after the embarrassing and dramatic failure to vote on health care in March House Republicans were ready to pass the bill and let the Senate take over Democrats taunted GOP lawmakers after the vote about 2018 prospects, but there's a long way to go It was the moment when hesitation became resolve. \u201cLet\u2019s get this f***ing thing done!\u201d former combat fighter pilot, Air Force Colonel and Arizona Rep. Martha McSally exhorted her colleagues in a private pre-vote pep rally on Capitol Hill, as House Republicans entrusted their futures to fate and agreed to vote to repeal Obamacare. What's in the Republican health care bill Nearby, House Speaker Paul Ryan was \u201cgiddy,\u201d said one colleague, sensing the narrowest of reputation-saving wins after a trial by political fire. Down Pennsylvania Avenue, as Thursday\u2019s vote neared, President Donald Trump settled in front of a TV, his Twitter account poised, but slipping into the unusual state of calm that aides say envelops the hyperactive commander-in-chief when moments of history beckon. For Democrats, by contrast, there was only deflation and despair \u2013 as Obamacare, the law with nine lives, absorbed a dramatic blow. But thoughts of revenge also stirred. GOP lawmakers filed out of the House to a serenade: \u201cNa, Na, Na, Na, Hey, Hey, Goodbye,\u201d from Democrats convinced the Republicans had sealed their fate in the 2018 mid-terms. Democrats sing 'Goodbye' after vote Despite the Trump and GOP victory rally at the White House, the past few months are just an appetizer as the bill goes to the Senate and members head home to their constituents. There will be more rounds of Republican strife and debates over arcane parliamentary procedure with a new cast of lawmakers. Vice President Mike Pence \u2013 who keeps Capitol Police officers busy with his frequent visits \u2013 will spend more time in his Hill office. We\u2019ll see a new report of how the bill will impact Americans. The tweets will undoubtedly continue. This article relates behind-the-scenes negotiations and the emotional and political storm that raged on Capitol Hill as the House GOP belatedly, but triumphantly, honored a promise to its voters that it first made seven years ago and has renewed many times since. Based on dozens of conversations with Republican and Democratic leaders, lawmakers and political aides by CNN\u2019s teams on Capitol Hill and in the White House, it reveals how House GOP members finally steeled themselves to overcome the infighting and inaction that tarnished Trump\u2019s First 100 Days. It is also the story of how the GOP decided that the price of inaction now was greater than the risk of passing a bill that even many Senate Republicans believe is deeply flawed. Trump praises Australia's universal healthcare after Obamacare repeal \u201cI think people in the House just simply wanted to get a bill out of the House and hoped that the Senate did something with it,\u201d said Rep. Charlie Dent, one of 20 Republicans who voted no. But for those on the other side, victory tastes sweet. \u201cThis is a great plan,\u201d Trump said at the White House, seemingly looking forward to the next round. \u201cI actually think it will get even better. This is a repeal and replace of Obamacare. Make no mistake about it.\u201d Flash back six weeks and it was all so different. After pulling an earlier version of the bill, a defeated Ryan admitted that Obamacare was \u201cthe law of the land,\u201d and that the GOP, for now, had missed its moment. But health care reform still had a faint pulse. A former opponent of the House bill, Sen. Rand Paul, wearing a Duke baseball cap from his alma mater, surprised the White House press pool after returning from golf with Trump on April 2, saying a deal was getting closer. The President tweeted that \u201ctalks on Repealing and Replacing ObamaCare are, and have been, going on, and will continue until such time as a deal is hopefully struck.\u201d Talks on Repealing and Replacing ObamaCare are, and have been, going on, and will continue until such time as a deal is hopefully struck. It seemed like Trumpian bluster. Ryan was also quietly regrouping. He let the dust settle amid humiliating questions about his leadership. Critics highlighted his apparently misfiring relationship with Trump. In reality, that impression was premature. The two men \u2013 opposites in temperament and style \u2013 grew increasingly close in the foxhole in the weeks to come. Even so, there was no immediate sense among GOP leaders that health care\u2019s time had come again. Committee chairs were gung ho to take on tax reform. Emotional GOP congressman cites family medical bills after vote But Ryan did encourage members to keep talking about health care. Though optimism had been shattered, a more bottom-up approach was worth a shot. The Wisconsin Republican reasoned that time and rising political pressure on his members were needed to knit party splits before he could try again. Ryan\u2019s top health care staffer, Matt Hoffmann, served as the go-between as Rep. Mark Meadows, chairman of the Freedom Caucus and Rep. Tom McArthur, a second-term New Jersey lawmaker and chair of the Tuesday Group moderates, worked to fuse divisions that sent the American Health Care Act crashing. Throughout April they swapped legislative language, finally agreeing on a deal to allow states to seek waivers to weaken several key Obamacare reforms that protect those with pre-existing conditions. But in a concession to moderates, the provision would not apply to those who maintained continuous coverage. Once what became known as the MacArthur amendment was codified, whip teams set about testing its support in the Republican conference and solidifying the votes of Freedom Caucus members, the senior GOP source said. The White House was agitating for a vote as a capstone to a barren First 100 Days. A week ago, House leaders decided not to try to ram the bill through just to meet the arbitrary deadline. But despite another perceived failure, the process was \u201c100 percent still alive,\u201d one senior GOP aide said. Questions still lingered about pre-existing conditions \u2013 resulting in Rep. Fred Upton\u2019s bombshell announcement that he would vote no, a brick wall that could have again blocked the GOP\u2019s efforts. Who is Rep. Tom MacArthur? But after a meeting with the President alongside his colleague Billy Long of Missouri and a guarantee that funding for high risk pools would rise from $5 billion to $8 billion, Upton came on board. Though Democrats and many policy experts say $8 billion is a drop in the bucket of the cash needed to fund high risk pools, Upton\u2019s decision was crucial. \u201cIt gave our guys a clear-cut reason to get to yes,\u201d one senior GOP aide said. By Wednesday night, less than 12 hours after the full details emerged of the latest change to a seemingly ever evolving, always-rejected piece of legislation, Republican leaders met in Ryan\u2019s office. They didn\u2019t have a solid 216 yes votes, aides say. But they were close. Close enough to force the issue. How Republicans from Clinton-won districts voted on health care \u201cIt was time \u2013 we felt it was moving in the right direction, but we also knew we\u2019d hit a point of no return,\u201d one person directly involved in the process said. Thursday, it was clear the play had paid off. They were locking in votes. Pledges from the Department of Health and Human Services helped flip two members. Leadership guarantees of future legislation brought along another. Ryan, who generally eschews the hard, one-on-one sell with wavering members, did just that, several times, one source said. Implicit in all of it was protection \u2014 in the form of supportive GOP groups come campaign time \u2014 that would be there in spades for endangered members who went along, several sources said. One member in the conference meeting, where colleagues were greeted by the theme tune from \u201cRocky\u201d and snapshots of General George S. Patton, as well as McSally\u2019s rallying call, said the tone of Ryan\u2019s message to his troops was simple: \u201cIt\u2019s time to roll.\u201d Trump waited for the vote in typical style: by tweeting. \u201cIf victorious, Republicans will be having a big press conference at the beautiful Rose Garden of the White House immediately after vote!\u201d he wrote Thursday afternoon. Sanders: Thousands will die if bill passes And after weeks of misfires that exposed his inexperience in wooing Congress, he got his win. \u201cComing from a different world, and only being a politician for a short period of time, how am I doing? Am I doing OK?  I\u2019m President. Hey, I\u2019m President, do you believe it, right?\u201d he crowed in the Rose Garden. Months ago many of those beaming Republican leaders behind Trump had not believed it or in him. There had been whispers that Trump\u2019s loose tongue revealed his ignorance about what was in the bill and made compromise harder. But by Thursday afternoon, Trump was pouring praise on Ryan and his crew, and it did seem that, in the President\u2019s words, the party had \u201cdeveloped a bond.\u201d White House defends voting before CBO score A White House official told CNN that Trump had kept up an intense push behind the scenes, ensuring that aides supported MacArthur and Meadows as they sought common ground and tasking HHS Secretary Tom Price with briefing wavering members on Medicaid funding. He and Ryan swapped notes in multiple late night phone calls. \u201cThe President\u2019s been incredibly engaged in this process, particularly over the last several days,\u201d deputy press secretary Sarah Sanders said. For all his ham-fisted interventions, Trump has evolved through the health care process, aides believe. He now knows artificial deadlines cut no ice in Congress. He\u2019s also learned the legislative process is more complex than the business world \u2014 after running for office proclaiming his deal-making skills would take Washington by storm. \u201cIt\u2019s not so cut and dry here,\u201d one aide said, explaining Trump\u2019s thinking. \u201cThere\u2019s so many more players involved and everybody has something that they want.\u201d Still, you can\u2019t take the businessman out of the President \u2013 he still prizes the personal touch, the person said. Congressman admits he didn't read full health care bill before voting Trump\u2019s flexibility likely helped too. \u201cThis president probably has more philosophic dexterity than most of the presidents I\u2019ve dealt with in the past,\u201d said South Carolina Rep. Mark Sanford, who voted for the bill. \u201cThat makes it a little bit different because typically there is sort of a fixed starting point or a fixed ending point on where an administration might be.\u201d As the votes rolled in, Trump\u2019s coterie gathered in the dining room off the Oval Office, among them, Pence, Price, Trump\u2019s daughter Ivanka, son-in-law Jared Kushner, top Economic Adviser Gary Cohn, adviser Steve Bannon, counselor Kellyanne Conway, press aide Hope Hicks, political aide Dan Scavino and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services Administrator Seema Verma. It felt like election night all over again. \u201cWe were all overjoyed and he was very docile, frankly. Very hopeful but not prematurely celebrating. We saw the same thing today,\u201d one official said. While Trump took the plaudits, many players in the drama spoke approvingly of Pence. Even Dent, who voted against the bill, praised the Vice President\u2019s soft sell technique. \u201cHe wanted to work with me. Very civil, very constructive meeting as you would expect from Mike Pence,\u201d Dent recalled. \u201cI always get the sense that Mike Pence is the velvet glove, the soft touch. The good cop.\u201d \u201cHe knows how to talk to people,\u201d he added. Here's a list of the Republicans who voted 'no' on the health care bill Pence threw himself into the renewed push to pass health care soon after returning from a marathon trip to Asia. He was all over Capitol Hill over the last few days, forming a partnership with White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus, who roamed the House floor as the vote went ahead. Pence\u2019s ubiquity did not go unnoticed. A Capitol Police officer was overheard telling a colleague how he doesn\u2019t like the days when Pence is on the Hill because he likes to mingle so many members, the responsibility of protecting him becomes even more intense. In 2010, then-Vice President Joe Biden called Obamacare a \u201cbig f***ing deal. His sentiments were similar, for other reasons, on Thursday. \u201cDay of shame in Congress. Protections for pre-existing conditions, mental health, maternity care, addiction services \u2013 all gone,\u201d Biden tweeted. Day of shame in Congress. Protections for pre-existing conditions, mental health, maternity care, addiction services -- all gone. Cries of \u201cshame, shame, shame,\u201d greeted GOP lawmakers as they walked down the ornate steps on the East Front of the Capitol. House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi warned the GOP: \u201cYou have every provision of this bill tattooed on your forehead. You will glow in the dark on this one.\u201d How Senate Republicans plan to tackle health care But all may not be lost yet for the Democrats. The bill must go now to the Senate, and it emerged Thursday that the chamber will only use the House bill as a skeleton before writing its own legislation. Now, House members are going home, where protesters and raucous town halls certainly await. There is a feeling of accomplishment, several members acknowledged, that so far is a novelty in the new Republican era. They know what is ahead, and are ready. \u201cWe know the fight that\u2019s coming,\u201d one senior GOP aide said. \u201cWe want that fight.\u201d CNN\u2019s Dana Bash, Jeff Zeleny, Jim Acosta, MJ Lee and Athena Jones contributed to this report.",

            "article_content": "Most members of Congress are home in their districts for a two-week recess A tradition of most recesses is that lawmaker hold town hall meetings with constituents In February, the anti-Donald Trump protesters at a California Rep. Tom McClintock town hall meeting got so raucous that police escorted the Republican congressman out of the venue. Over the weekend, McClintock faced two more hours of sharp questions from an anti-Trump crowd over health care, the President\u2019s taxes and Syria. It didn\u2019t match the chaos of his earlier town hall \u2013 but McClintock did have to plead with the rowdy crowd for calm. \u201cLadies and gentleman, this is supposed to be a civil discussion,\u201d he said. \u201cBe civil, be polite, and allow people to have a civil exchange of ideas.\u201d Here\u2019s a list of all the town halls on Tuesday Over the next two weeks, many other Republicans could be pleading for the same sort of reprieve. McClintock was among the first of dozens of Republicans to face another round of protests and criticism as Congress takes a spring break. Republicans in competitive congressional districts will be under particularly intense scrutiny. Among the town halls that will draw the most attention: Rep. Leonard Lance, R-New Jersey, is holding one Wednesday evening in Flanders; Rep. Mike Coffman, R-Colorado, will be under a major spotlight Wednesday night in Aurora; and next week, Rep. Jeff Denham\u2019s Monday night event in Denair, California, and Rep. Scott Tipton of Colorado\u2019s town halls in Alamosa on Tuesday and Pueblo West on Thursday will be among the most-watched. The topic expected to once again dominate the town halls: Health care. GOP hopes to keep Kansas House seat in special election The failure of Trump and House Speaker Paul Ryan to convince fellow Republicans to repeal the Affordable Care Act gave an energized Democratic base an initial victory. Then, when Trump and the conservative House Freedom Caucus attempted to revive the health care effort, it revived progressive activists\u2019 efforts just days before lawmakers would head home for a two-week recess \u2013 with town hall meetings scheduled throughout. Groups like Indivisible and MoveOn.org are urging local progressives to attend the meetings. And the intensity of the interest around the events has lawmakers \u2013 especially moderate Republicans in competitive districts facing tough re-election battles in 2018 \u2013 paying close attention. At a town hall Saturday in West Chester, Pennsylvania Rep. Ryan Costello told the crowd he wouldn\u2019t accept two of the major policy goals of the conservative Freedom Caucus: Repealing Obamacare\u2019s \u201cessential health benefits\u201d mandating coverage for items like maternity care, and its \u201ccommunity rating\u201d provision that prohibits insurers from charging higher rates to those with pre-existing conditions. Democrats target black voters as money pours into Georgia House race Costello embraced the activists \u2013 even as he dodged a question on Trump\u2019s tax returns and refused the crowd\u2019s pleas to embrace a single-payer \u201cMedicare for all\u201d health care system. RELATED: Moderate Republican Costello feels health care pressure in town hall \u201cHow about that T-shirt?\u201d he asked the crowd of a woman\u2019s \u201cNevertheless she Persisted\u201d shirt \u2013 a slogan embraced by the left since Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell used the phrase to admonish firebrand Massachusetts Sen. Elizabeth Warren. \u201cLook at that pin!\u201d he told the crowd when another questioner approached wearing an anti-Trump \u201cResist\u201d pin on her shirt. RELATED: Women line up to get \u2018nevertheless, she persisted\u2019 tattoo In an interview beforehand, Costello was distracted several times by protesters just outside the window of his district office. \u201cGive us his tax returns,\u201d he chuckled, reading a passerby protester\u2019s sign. \u201cA roller-blader now is telling me about it,\u201d Costello muttered five minutes later as another man skated by. Costello is so attuned to those protesting him that in an interview, he laid out the schedules of each of the groups that protest outside his office in West Chester\u2019s town center daily and weekly. \u201cOn good days there\u2019s 50; on bad days there\u2019s 15,\u201d he said. He even asked the local Indivisible chapter to delay its planned noon Saturday protest by two hours to avoid a conflict with a military academy nomination event. It obliged. \u201cHopefully there will be more,\u201d he said, looking outside. \u201cThe more people, the better. It\u2019s democracy.\u201d Still, Costello wouldn\u2019t criticize the hard-line conservatives in his own party whose policy objectives caused part of the backlash he faced Saturday. \u201cIf you\u2019re going to be a governing majority in the House Republicans, we have to work through this stuff,\u201d Costello said. \u201cAnd I get concerned \u2026 finger-pointing can diminish our ability to marshal legislation forward.\u201d",

            "article_content": "With his nearly 35,000 tweets, President Donald Trump has amassed a dizzying catalog of droll cultural musings, salty personal attacks, self-plugs and political punditry. His prolonged tweetstorm warning President Barack Obama not to attack Syria after it used chemical weapons in 2013 has gotten special attention over the past 48 hours, as Trump considered and then carried out the kind of retaliatory attack he advised against years earlier. For most of us, tweets from the past remain mercifully swallowed up and hidden in the world wide cobwebs. But as Trump recently reminded an interviewer, \u201cI\u2019m President, and you\u2019re not.\u201d His posts, landing on both sides of issues from war and peace to his predecessor\u2019s golf game, keep coming back. When the White House released a statement Tuesday calling a chemical weapon attack by the Syrian government \u201ca consequence of the past administration\u2019s weakness and irresolution,\u201d Trump\u2019s tweets \u2013 from 2013 \u2013 came under particular scrutiny. Over the course of nearly two weeks that summer, as the Obama administration weighed military action against the Syrian regime following a similar atrocity, Trump kept up a steady drumbeat \u2026 of caution. \u201cPresident Obama, do not attack Syria,\u201d he wrote on September 7, 2013, one of more than 50 tweets to that effect. \u201cThere is no upside and tremendous downside. Save your \u2018powder\u2019 for another (and more important) day!\u201d President Obama, do not attack Syria. There is no upside and tremendous downside. Save your \"powder\" for another (and more important) day! When the US and Russia negotiated a deal to take apart the regime\u2019s chemical arsenal, ending the immediate crisis, Trump jumped back in with a more familiar line of criticism. \u201cThe Russians are playing a very smart game,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cIn the meantime they are buying lots of time for Syria and making U.S. look foolish. Dangerous!\u201d The Russians are playing a very smart game. In the meantime they are buying lots of time for Syria and making U.S. look foolish. Dangerous! Episodes like these \u2013 when Trump\u2019s current actions or pronouncements run up against his pre-presidential blaring \u2013 have become a nearly daily occurrence. The juxtapositions are typically framed by reporters and livened by critics, creating the odd effect of Trump, the citizen or candidate, trolling Trump, the president. Here is an (incomplete) account of his most frequently exhumed self contradictions. After Republicans agreed with Democrats on a deal to avert the fiscal cliff in 2013, Trump registered his dismay, saying of the GOP, \u201cJust shows that you can have all the cards and lose if you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing.\u201d Just shows that you can have all the cards and lose if you don\u2019t know what you\u2019re doing. More than four years later, those words were rehashed by Democrats delighting in the demise of Trumpcare. When Trump publicly blamed House Freedom Caucus members for derailing the widely unpopular bill, another old tweet \u2013 quoting a Trump favorite, Henry Ford \u2013 resurfaced: \u201c\u2018Don\u2019t find fault. Find a remedy.\u2019 \u2013Henry Ford\u201d \"Don't find fault. Find a remedy.\"  --Henry Ford Trump initially believed that Republican challenger Mitt Romney had won the the popular vote on the night Obama secured re-election in 2012. This perceived injustice upset Trump mightily. So he called for a protest. \u201cWe can\u2019t let this happen,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cWe should march on Washington and stop this travesty. Our nation is totally divided!\u201d We can't let this happen. We should march on Washington and stop this travesty. Our nation is totally divided! But Trump, then president-elect, changed his tune four years later, condemning protesters in the aftermath of his own election. \u201cJust had a very open and successful presidential election. Now professional protesters, incited by the media, are protesting,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cVery unfair!\u201d Just had a very open and successful presidential election. Now professional protesters, incited by the media, are protesting. Very unfair! Compounding the irony, of course, is that Trump himself won under precisely the circumstances \u2013 with the popular vote winner losing the election \u2013 he called a \u201ctravesty\u201d four years earlier. \u201cThe electoral college is a disaster for a democracy,\u201d he declared that night in 2012. The electoral college is a disaster for a democracy. Reflecting on his triumph, Trump offered a revised take in 2016. \u201cThe Electoral College is actually genius,\u201d he tweeted, \u201cin that it brings all states, including the smaller ones, into play. Campaigning is much different!\u201d The Electoral College is actually genius in that it brings all states, including the smaller ones, into play. Campaigning is much different! Trump began his presidency with a flurry of executive actions. Critics have described his travel ban orders as illegal, cruel and overreaching, or some combination of the three. The Trump of 2012 seems like he would have agreed with them on at least two counts. \u201cWhy is @BarackObama constantly issuing executive orders that are major power grabs of authority?,\u201d he asked. Why is @BarackObama constantly issuing executive orders that are major power grabs of authority? This is the latest http://t.co/4IVBckTE Fewer than 100 days into his presidency, Trump has already held a number of (2020!) campaign rallies and routinely spends his weekends at his \u201cWinter White House\u201d in Florida. There\u2019s no rule against either, but judging by his past tweets, Trump might be disappointed with himself. In September 2013 (not a campaign season), he tweaked Obama, who was at a G20 summit, saying the former president \u201cis not a leader, he\u2019s just a campaigner!\u201d Obama is not a leader, he's just a campaigner! Trump delivered a similar attack in November 2011, again questioning Obama\u2019s leadership qualities. \u201cThe habitual vacationer \u2013 @BarackObama \u2013 spent 9 days before the critical Super Committee deadline traveling,\u201d Trump tweeted. Jump ahead to 2016 and Trump did about the same, spending the March weekend before the GOP\u2019s self-imposed Obamacare overhaul deadline at Mar-a-Lago in Florida. But this runs much deeper. Over the years, Trump repeatedly ripped Obama over the cost his travel and vacations. \u201cPresident @BarackObama\u2019s vacation is costing taxpayers millions of dollars\u2014-Unbelievable!,\u201d he tweeted in January 2012. President @BarackObama's vacation is costing taxpayers millions of dollars----Unbelievable! Four months earlier, Trump asked: \u201cWhy did @BarackObama and his family travel separately to Martha\u2019s Vineyard? They love to extravagantly spend on the taxpayers\u2019 dime.\u201d Why did @BarackObama and his family travel separately to Martha's Vineyard? They love to extravagantly spend on the taxpayers' dime. Trump broke with Republican orthodoxy when he said during the primary campaign that entitlement cuts to the social safety net were a nonstarter. And yet, there was Medicaid, on the chopping block during Obamacare negotiations. With Republicans considering a deal to roll back expansion alongside broader cuts to the program, critics exhumed this May 2015 tweet to haunt Trump: \u201cI was the first & only potential GOP candidate to state there will be no cuts to Social Security, Medicare & Medicaid,\u201d he said then. \u201c(Former GOP rival Mike) Huckabee copied me.\u201d I was the first & only potential GOP candidate to state there will be no cuts to Social Security, Medicare & Medicaid. Huckabee copied me. \u201cPoliticians are all talk and no action,\u201d Trump tweeted on May 27, 2015, before he\u2019d even formally entered the Republican race. \u201cBush and Rubio couldn\u2019t answer simple question on Iraq. They will NEVER make America great again! Politicians are all talk and no action. Bush and Rubio couldn't answer simple question on Iraq. They will NEVER make America great again! The line was revived a few months later, when details of a Trump legal deposition were published in The New York Times. In discussing his penchant, and talent, for shading a public narrative in his favor, he made a comparison. \u201cI\u2019m no different from a politician running for office,\u201d Trump said. \u201cYou always want to put the best foot forward.\u201d On Wednesday, Trump, in response to a question from The New York Times, suggested that former national security adviser Susan Rice had illegally sought the partially redacted names of Trump associates in highly classified intelligence reports. It was the kind of thing that might have bothered Trump himself \u2013 if it were July 2012. So @BarackObama's campaign is calling @MittRomney a potential criminal http://t.co/gLPRy9lS How about Obama's Tony Rezko land deal! \u201cSo @BarackObama\u2019s campaign is calling @MittRomney a potential criminal,\u201d he wrote then, disapprovingly. \u201cHow about Obama\u2019s Tony Rezko land deal!\u201d In 2012, Democrats who took a pass were, per a Trump tweet, simply practicing \u201csmart politics.\u201d Many Democrats up for reelection in 2012 are skipping the DNC convention in Charlotte http://t.co/Cak0BpR1 Smart politics! When asked about the number of top Republicans and former presidents sitting out his convention in 2016, Trump was less assured, telling CNBC, \u201cI don\u2019t think it matters.\u201d Years before he selected the former Utah governor to be his man in Moscow, Trump made good sport of lampooning Jon Huntsman, Obama\u2019s first ambassador to China, on social media. \u201c@JonHuntsman called to set up a meeting,\u201d Trump tweeted in 2011. \u201cHaven\u2019t returned his call.\u201d @JonHuntsman called to set up a meeting. Haven't returned his call. In January 2012, with Huntsman running in the GOP primary, Trump took another swipe \u2013 one more in a prolonged series. \u201c\u2018Nobody cares\u2019 about the Iowa straw poll is what @JonHuntsman said yesterday,\u201d he tweeted. \u201cHis problem is that nobody cares about his campaign (or him).\u201d Trump has regularly hovered at historically low approval ratings during his brief White House tenure. And if he brushes off those numbers now, he didn\u2019t always. \u201c@BarackObama has a record low 39% Gallup approval rating,\u201d he tweeted in August 2011. \u201cWhy so high?\u201d @BarackObama has a record low 39% Gallup approval rating. Why so high? But Trump spoke too soon, and left too easily accessible a record of his own. In March, his own Gallup approval rating sunk to 37%. \u201cWhy is @BarackObama spending millions to try and hide his records?,\u201d Trump tweeted in June 2012. \u201cHe is the least transparent President \u2013 ever \u2013 and he ran on transparency.\u201d Why is @BarackObama spending millions to try and hide his records? He is the least transparent President--ever--and he ran on transparency. Trump, who has still not released his tax returns, also griped about Mitt Romney\u2019s tardiness in sharing his. Mitt Romney didn\u2019t show his tax return until SEPTEMBER 21, 2012, and then only after being humiliated by Harry (Reid)! Mitt Romney didn't show his tax return until SEPTEMBER 21, 2012, and then only after being humiliated by Harry R! A bad messenger for estab! \u201cObama through his cronies said the Keysyone (sic) pipeline was \u2018not political\u2019 - how much can one man lie about even the most obvious things?\u201d Trump asked in April 2014. Obama through his cronies said the Keysyone pipeline was \"not political\" - how much can one man lie about even the most obvious things? Less than three years later, Trump\u2019s own honesty issues had become such that Time magazine dedicated a feature to examining them, asking on its cover, \u201cIs Truth Dead?\u201d Trump has often sought to undermine news reports about his campaign\u2019s alleged ties to Russia by pointing reporters\u2019 use of anonymous sources. But when it came to promoting his birther crusade, Trump was happy to employ his own. \u201cAn \u2018extremely credible source\u2019 has called my office,\u201d he tweeted, \u201cand told me that @BarackObama\u2019s birth certificate is a fraud.\u201d An 'extremely credible source' has called my office and told me that @BarackObama's birth certificate is a fraud. Trump\u2019s \u201csource,\u201d of course, was either incorrect, lying or nonexistent. Trump hasn\u2019t let the burden of the presidency keep him off the links. But when Obama indulged the same pastime, he was relentlessly critical, mocking and chastising the former president at ever opportunity. Here are a select few: \u201cObama has admitted that he spends his mornings watching @ESPN. Then he plays golf, fundraises & grants amnesty to illegals.\u201d Obama has admitted that he spends his mornings watching @ESPN. Then he plays golf, fundraises & grants amnesty to illegals. \u201c@BarackObama played golf yesterday. Now he heads to a 10 day vacation in Martha\u2019s Vineyard. Nice work ethic.\u201d @BarackObama played golf yesterday. Now he  heads to a 10 day vacation in Martha's Vineyard.  Nice work ethic. \u201cCan you believe that,with all of the problems and difficulties facing the U.S., President Obama spent the day playing golf.Worse than Carter.\u201d Can you believe that,with all of the problems and difficulties facing the U.S., President Obama spent the day playing golf.Worse than Carter \u201cWe pay for Obama\u2019s travel so he can fundraise millions so Democrats can run on lies. Then we pay for his golf.\u201d We pay for Obama's travel so he can fundraise millions so Democrats can run on lies.

            "article_content": "The pace lags behind his predecessors Trump still needs to fill nearly 2,000 appointed positions in governments President Donald Trump still hasn\u2019t named a number of key deputy secretaries to back up his Cabinet \u2013 posts that experts say are essential to smooth functioning of the government. The lack of nominees for the key positions comes as Trump still needs to fill nearly 2,000 appointed positions in governments \u2013 and as Democrats continue to slow-walk confirmations of the nominees he has named. The White House strongly disputes that it is behind, pointing the finger at Democrats for delaying the process. Four deputy secretary positions are seen as especially important because of the role of the agencies involved in national security and the economy: deputy secretary of state, treasury, defense and deputy attorney general. Trump has only named one nominee of those four, for the post of deputy attorney general: Rod Rosenstein, who had his Senate hearing this week. The President also asked Deputy Defense Secretary Robert Work to stay on three months from the Obama administration but has not indicated what the long-term plan is for that position. Trump\u2019s pace of deputy appointments lags behind his predecessors, according to data from the Partnership for Public Service, a nonpartisan nonprofit dedicated to good governance. It is also only a minute fraction of the more than 1,000 Senate-confirmed positions a President must fill. Max Stier, president of PPS, likens deputy secretaries to chief operating officers at each agency, saying little effective management can be done without them. And, he notes, most agencies of government are currently operating amid strong uncertainty, with temporary career staffers holding these positions. \u201cUncertainty is the bane of good management. And there\u2019s an awful lot of uncertainty right now,\u201d Stier said. \u201cAn acting person is a bit like the substitute teacher. They may be a wonderful teacher, but the fact that they\u2019re the substitute teacher means they get no respect, they have no perceived authority to solve things, they don\u2019t set the lesson plan, and you also don\u2019t build the same kind of rapport with your peers across government, which is also super important,\u201d Stier added. Trump himself has complained that Senate Democrats are taking too long to confirm his picks. \u201cI still have people out there waiting to be approved and everyone knows they\u2019re gonna be approved,\u201d Trump told the Conservative Political Action Conference last month. \u201cIt\u2019s just a delay, delay, delay, it\u2019s really sad. We still don\u2019t have our Cabinet. \u2026 I hate having a Cabinet meeting and I see all these empty seats.\u201d That was the White House position as well, with spokeswoman Lindsay Walters saying the lack of confirmed secretaries is part of the problem. \u201cIf the Democrats had chosen to do their job and not slow roll the process and confirm these individuals the first day, we would have been in a different position today,\u201d Walters said. \u201cIn order to put in place a deputy you need to have a secretary. And due to the Democrats\u2019 decision to drag their feet, our pace has been significantly slowed down due to their shenanigans.\u201d Trump has named a handful of deputies at agencies, though none have yet been confirmed. Some of the vacancies, like State and Treasury, were agencies with early secretary nominations. By Inauguration Day he had chosen Rosenstein; his deputy at the Commerce Department, businessman and wealthy Republican donor Todd Ricketts; and an administrator for the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services in the Department of Health and Human Services, Seema Verma. He also before the end of January nominated Elaine Duke for deputy secretary for the Department of Homeland Security. This week, he named Jeffrey Rosen as his pick for deputy transportation secretary. Trump still has to fill nearly 2,000 vacancies All told, Trump has named 20 non-Cabinet-level positions, including two who withdrew \u2013 a list that includes nominees for ambassadorships, counsel positions and commissions, according to a tracker from PPS maintained with The Washington Post. That\u2019s on top of 23 Cabinet-level nominations, including one who withdrew. In contrast, former President Barack Obama had his deputy secretaries for state and defense named on Inauguration Day, and his deputy attorney general was named six days later. All three were confirmed by March 12 of that year. His Treasury nominee wasn\u2019t named until April, and confirmed in May. Former President George W. Bush, who had a shortened presidential transition due to the delay in certifying the 2000 election, named his deputy defense secretary in mid-February, his deputy secretaries of state and treasury on March 8 and his deputy attorney general on March 22. Confirmation for the latter two took months. Former President Bill Clinton named his deputy secretaries of state and treasury named on Inauguration Day and his deputy at the Department of Defense on Feb. 24. He did not name a deputy attorney general until May. All were confirmed shortly after being named. By March 10, Obama had named 53 Cabinet-level and other positions, including nearly 10 deputy secretaries and another 10 assistant, associate or undersecretaries. Trump has more than 1,900 vacancies within his new administration, most of which did not require Senate confirmation, according to data from tracking service Leadership Directories reviewed by CNN. The data did not include federal judgeships. Republicans have enough seats in the Senate, a slim 52-vote majority, to confirm all of Trump\u2019s nominees after a rule change in a previous Congress that removed the 60-vote threshold for nominees. But Democrats have used whatever tactics they can to slow down the pace of nominees \u2013 they say to properly vet them \u2013 including requiring lawmakers to use all the procedurally mandated time on almost every nomination and even in some cases not showing up to committee votes to deny a quorum. The Democrats say the slow pace has more to do with Trump and his nominees than with dragging their feet. They argue Trump\u2019s nominees have not been properly vetted or present conflicts of interest that must be heard. Trump\u2019s selections do include a number of millionaires and billionaires with complicated financial situations that have been slow to sort out. Sources close to Ricketts say he is still committed to serving, but acknowledge that his financial paperwork with the Office of Government Ethics is taking time and could be difficult to wrap up. Other factors are seen as at play \u2013 including difficulty recruiting. Trump may be having difficulty filling slots because some Republicans are reluctant to serve and others are being passed over because they were critical of Trump during the campaign. Elliott Abrams, a veteran of the Reagan and George W. Bush administrations, was nixed by Trump for the No. 2 job at the State Department after he found out about criticism Abrams made of Trump during the campaign. Until then, he had been a leading contender for the still unfilled position. There have also been reports of clashes between the White House and Cabinet secretaries of their picks, some of which Stier has heard firsthand. \u201cThe agency hiring process is a collaborative effort between the departments and the White House,\u201d Walters said in response. But Stier said the White House needs to recognize that it cannot select the entire government with the same process it used for the Cabinet, and needs to allow Cabinet secretaries authority. \u201cAs with any large organization, no one individual is going to be able to run the whole place by themselves, it\u2019s going to be the team. And you need to have people in leadership that work well together,\u201d Stier said. \u201cSo while the White House has equities on who gets the job, at the end of the day, the secretaries ought to have the final say on who will be there because they are the ones who will make it work.\u201d CNN\u2019s Jeff Zeleny, Barbara Starr and Aaron Kessler contributed to this report.",

But while the President\u2019s tweets monopolized media coverage over the weekend, lawmakers have plenty of other work, including important action on health care and defense. House Republicans are aiming to finalize their Obamacare repeal bill that includes some replacement components. Two key committees are expected to markup the proposal - starting as early as Wednesday. Democrats will propose a slew of amendments in an effort to force Republicans to go on the record on a broad range of issues. GOP leaders are expected to hold more \u201clistening sessions\u201d in an effort to keep their conference on the same page but continue to face some stiff resistance from a bloc of conservatives. The House will vote on defense appropriations bill \u2013 the first spending bill as GOP leaders eye an end of April deadline for passing a funding bill to avoid a shutdown. The Senate returns to session Monday afternoon and will debate rolling back an Obama-era Labor Department rule that Republicans say is onerous because it requires companies bidding for large federal contracts to disclose past labor violations and alleged violations. Republicans call it a \u201cblackmail\u201d rule because they think labor unions could use the threat of public disclosure to win concessions from employers. Republicans are using the special legislative tool known as the Congressional Review Act to get rid of the regulation. The House has already passed it and Trump is expected to sign it. Later this week, the full Senate is expected to vote on Seema Verma to head the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services. She\u2019s expected to be a central administration player in repealing and replacing Obamacare. On Tuesday, the Judiciary Committee will hold a hearing on Rod Rosenstein to be the deputy attorney general. This hearing will be of interest because of the controversy surrounding Attorney General Jeff Sessions and his decision to recuse himself from any potential investigations into the Trump campaign and Russia\u2019s alleged interference in the election. If he is confirmed as the second in command at DOJ, Rosenstein would become the person with oversight of any of those investigations. Also Tuesday, National Security Adviser Lt. Gen. H.R. McMaster will testify before a closed session of the Senate Armed Services Committee.  Because he is staying on active duty to keep his rank, he will require the approval of the Armed Services Committee and later the full Senate. Sen. Lindsey Graham in his capacity as chairman of the Foreign Operations subcommittee of Appropriations is holding a seemingly timely hearing Tuesday with ambassadors of several countries that neighbor Russia \u2013 including Georgia, Poland and Ukraine \u2014 to examine Russian intentions in the region.",

            "article_content": "A bipartisan congressional group wants to meet with President Donald Trump They said they want to talk infrastructure and tax reform A bipartisan group of members of Congress wants to meet with President Donald Trump to discuss tax reform and infrastructure investment. Reps. Josh Gottheimer, a New Jersey Democrat, and Tom Reed, a New York Republican, said they led the \u201cProblem Solvers Caucus\u201d in sending a letter to talk about these priorities of the business community. \u201cAddressing either issue, on a broad bipartisan basis, could give a significant boost to our economy and provide Americans with confidence that government can work for them,\u201d the letter, dated February 8, read. A message left with the White House seeking response was not immediately returned Tuesday night. The Problem Solvers Caucus began as an initiative of the group \u201cNo Labels,\u201d a bipartisan, centrist organization that works to forge what it calls a \u201cnew center.\u201d No Labels is a political organization founded in 2010 with the stated goal of increasing growth, balancing the budget, protecting Medicare and Social Security and promoting energy independence. No Labels has said the existence of the caucus is its \u201ccentral mission.\u201d Before Trump was inaugurated, the group sent a letter telling him it wanted to work with his administration on taxes and infrastructure. Why tax reform is a lot harder than it looks These issues have been major topics on Capitol Hill since before Trump\u2019s election, and the new President has indicated his desire to advance tax reform and infrastructure spending. However, movement on those issues remains up in the air. Last week, Trump announced his intention to release his own tax plan in the coming weeks, and before Trump\u2019s inauguration, Rep. Bill Shuster, the Republican chairman of the House Transportation Committee, said there wouldn\u2019t be an infrastructure package in Trump\u2019s first 100 days.",

            "article_content": "For years Democrats have run from the \"liberal\" label In 2016, they still prefer the term \"progressive\" Bernie Sanders might have lost the mathematical race to be the Democratic presidential nominee, but he succeeded in pulling the party and victor Hillary Clinton further to the left on a host of issues. Yet even Sanders\u2019 revolutionary quest could not break through one remaining barrier for the party: the use of the term \u201cliberal.\u201d The Vermont senator and former secretary of state duked it out on the trail over many positions that put them squarely in the liberal camp. But the word they used in their battles was \u201cprogressive,\u201d not the loaded L-word. Sanders, a self-proclaimed democratic socialist,\u00a0frequently set the terms of debate on the left end of the spectrum. He argued that a candidate truly dedicated to progressive causes wouldn\u2019t have taken big donations from Wall Street, flip-flopped on the Keystone XL pipeline or voted for the Iraq War as Clinton did. \u201cI think, frankly, it is hard to be a real progressive and to take on the establishment in a way that I think has to be taken on, when you become as dependent as she has through her super PAC and in other ways on Wall Street and drug-company money,\u201d Sanders said shortly before his big New Hampshire primary win. Polls: Dems want a candidate more liberal than Obama After only\u00a0narrowly winning the Iowa caucuses on Feb. 1, Clinton fought back as a\u00a0\u201cprogressive who gets things done for people.\u201d She portrayed herself as equally committed to causes dear to progressives\u2019 hearts but more realistic about how to tackle political obstacles, like a Republican-controlled Congress. That parsing reflects an ongoing, if belated, effort by Democrats to shift the political language back in their favor. Democrats have political scar tissue from being repeatedly pummeled as liberals \u2013 including three straight crushing presidential defeats in the 1980s. It\u2019s a label so\u00a0toxic\u00a0after decades of Republican attacks that even the most ardent Democrats run away from it. Compare that approach to the Republican presidential field, where every day White House hopefuls tried to out-\u201cconservative\u201d\u00a0each other. At the February 13 GOP debate, then-candidate Jeb Bush\u00a0called himself a conservative\u00a0six times, with Donald Trump and Ted Cruz just behind and the other\u00a0Republicans\u00a0invoking it frequently as well. Since the mid-1960s, conservative politicians, activists and media outlets have shaded \u201cliberal\u201d with an ominous and sinister connotation. Upheaval in the 1960s spurred this on, as conservatives portrayed Democrats as libertine hedonists, permissive to a fault and at odds with Middle America\u2019s clean-cut values. Fair or not, Democrats generally did little to sever the term with that image. \u201cDemocrats fled the word \u2018liberal\u2019 as it got demonized,\u201d said Bob Shrum, for decades an adviser on Democratic presidential campaigns. \u201cThey didn\u2019t fight back; they gave it up.\u201d They did, however, more recently engage in some linguistic counter-programming,\u00a0according to\u00a0Rep. Steve Israel of New York, who chairs\u00a0the House Democrats\u2019 messaging arm. \u201cIn 2010,\u00a0\u2018tea party\u2019\u00a0was a very shiny and popular brand. What we\u2019ve done is brought the name tea party into negative territory,\u201d he told CNN.\u00a0\u201cNow a lot of Republicans lead with disclaiming and distancing themselves from the tea party.\u201d Hillary Clinton's life in the spotlight Shrum,\u00a0currently a professor\u00a0of practical politics at the University of Southern California,\u00a0also said\u00a0the term\u00a0\u201cconservative\u201d could potentially be a rhetorical target for Democrats, especially\u00a0with\u00a0Trump, the presumptive Republican presidential nominee, intermittently describing himself that way. \u201cI think conservatism in this election cycle has actually morphed from a set of principles and programs to a set of grievances and anger. Trump expresses that,\u201d he said. Democratic consultant Doug Hattaway said there was never a conscious effort by members of his party to not defend the \u201cliberal\u201d term. Moving away from it was the path of least resistance. \u201cRather than defining the word in a positive way, Democrats allowed Republicans to tarnish it,\u201d Hattaway said. \u201cDemocrats need to either re-define the term or adopt \u2018progressive\u2019 in a consistent way. \u2018Progressive\u2019 is seen as a positive word, but it\u2019s not clearly defined, so there might be an opportunity for Democrats to own it.\u201d Being called a liberal wasn\u2019t always so politically toxic for Democrats. In the immediate post-World War II years, with New Deal memories still fresh for millions of Americans who lived through the Great Depression, the term was used proudly. Liberals saw themselves as accepting the idea of progressive change and\u00a0being forward-looking in a rapidly evolving world. In President Harry Truman\u2019s 1948 campaign, he frequently called himself a liberal, noted Sharon E. Jarvis, a University of Texas professor and author of\u00a0\u201cThe Talk of the Party: Political Labels, Symbolic Capital, and American Life.\u201d Truman told one audience\u00a0that he was \u201chappy to pay tribute to the liberal spirit of the forces of labor in the United States\u201d and wanted \u201cto reiterate emphatically [his] faith in the liberal philosophy of the Democratic Party.\u201d In his 1959 inaugural address, California Gov. Pat Brown used the word \u201cliberal\u201d or \u201cliberalism\u201d\u00a0seven times in the first eight paragraphs. The catchphrase of his Democratic administration was \u201cresponsible liberalism.\u201d President John F. Kennedy similarly defined a liberal as someone who \u201ccares about the welfare of the people \u2013 their health, their housing, their schools, their jobs, their civil rights and their civil liberties.\u201d By that definition, he added, \u201cI\u2019m proud to say I\u2019m a liberal.\u201d More than a half-century on, though, Democrats demur in describing themselves that way. Israel, who is retiring at the end of this term after 16 years in Congress, said making \u201cliberal\u201d a\u00a0political\u00a0bad word was part of an upper hand Republicans gained in communications strategy. \u201cRepublicans developed this message brand of \u2018tax-and-spend (liberals),\u2019 and got very disciplined on it,\u201d he said. \u201cYou could be talking about the Mets vs. the Dodgers, and good Republican operatives would be able to weave in tax-and-spend.\u201d Throughout President Ronald Reagan\u2019s\u00a0two terms, conservatives pummeled Democrats with the \u201cliberal\u201d label, using it as shorthand for being\u00a0soft on communism and achingly sensitive to minority grievances. Reagan himself, usually known for his upbeat rhetoric, jabbed the opposition with the liberal tag at the 1988 Republican National Convention. The president decried\u00a0\u201cliberal, liberal, liberal\u201d policies of the Democrats. \u201cEvery single year I\u2019ve been in office, I have supported and called for a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution, and the liberals have said no every year,\u201d Reagan told the uproarious crowd in a typical refrain. \u201cI called for the line-item veto, which 43 governors have, to cut fat in the budget, and the liberals have said no.\u201d \u201cReagan sneered the word \u2018liberal\u2019 or \u2018liberalism\u2019 22 times in a 25-minute address,\u201d The Los Angeles Times\u00a0reported. How Ronald Reagan never left the campaign trail And it seemed to work, as his vice president, George H.W. Bush, won the White House echoing much of this rhetoric. No other Republican figure, however, probably did more to make Democrats run scared from \u201cliberalism\u201d than a one-time backbench Republican congressman from Georgia, Newt Gingrich. As House minority whip\u00a0in 1990,\u00a0his political action committee GOPAC\u00a0sent out a memo\u00a0titled \u201cLanguage: A Key Mechanism of Control\u201d to several thousand Republican candidates. It advised them to use a series of pejoratives against Democrats. \u201cLiberal\u201d was among the most prominent, along with \u201cdecay,\u201d \u201cdestructive,\u201d \u201cpathetic\u201d and \u201ccorrupt.\u201d After Republicans in 1994 won control of the House for the first time in 40 years, Gingrich, now speaker, had a much more prominent perch from which to tag Democrats as dangerous liberals. So did fellow Republicans who took over the Senate. A typical ad ran in 1996 against Democratic Sen. Paul Wellstone of Minnesota. Wellstone\u2019s Republican opponent declared on the TV screen that Wellstone was beyond liberal, an \u201cultraliberal\u201d and, finally, \u201cembarrassingly liberal.\u201d The attacks didn\u2019t work, however, as Wellstone won re-election. And the Gingrich era may have marked the high point for the effectiveness of slams on Democrats as liberals. President Bill Clinton had something to do with it, basing his 1996 re-election\u00a0on a \u201ctriangulation\u201d strategy and positioning himself between ideological extremes of the left and right. That included signing a welfare-overhaul bill pushed by congressional Republicans while rejecting GOP demands to cut Social Security and Medicare benefits. The term\u00a0\u201cliberal\u201d\u00a0still pops up in Republican campaign rhetoric, though far less frequently than it used to. Overall the phrase seems less potent. Without an united party can Trump win in November? According to\u00a0a recent Pew Research Center poll, Democratic voters are increasingly identifying with the label liberal. \u201cIn 2015, more Democratic voters identified as liberals (42%) than as moderates (38%) or conservatives (17%),\u201d reported Pew. According to Jeremy Mayer,\u00a0associate\u00a0professor in the\u00a0School of Policy, Government and International Affairs at George Mason University, \u201cAmerican politics is so polarized now that anyone who is scared of \u2018liberal\u2019 is already voting for the Republican nominee. To rally the base of your party, use the most vivid, gripping language that doesn\u2019t set off independents too much.\u201d With five months to go before voters decide whether Hillary Clinton or Donald Trump will be the 45th president, Democrats may for the first time see political advantage in calling themselves \u201cliberal.\u201d After all, a rapidly diversifying demographic voting base \u2013 which twice put Barack Obama in the White House \u2013 may identify with the phrase. But based on recent political history, don\u2019t expect to hear it in Hillary Clinton\u2019s acceptance speech at the Democratic convention in Philadelphia. Or anywhere else.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Edward J. McCaffery is Robert C. Packard trustee chair in law and a professor of law, economics and political science at the University of Southern California. He is the author of \u201cFair Not Flat: How to Make the Tax System Better and Simpler\u201d and founder of the People\u2019s Tax Page. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. When Senator Bob Corker, R-Tennessee, a longtime \u201cdeficit hawk,\u201d or so-called fiscal conservative, voted against the Senate version of the Republican tax plan, it seemed as if principle might prevail \u2013 at least among Republicans not facing re-election. That particular fantasy did not last long. Corker announced on Friday that he would vote for the Senate-House Conference version of the tax cut bonanza, even though it has the same irresponsible deficit impact as the Senate version that he had  opposed. Shortly after Corker\u2019s announcement, the International Business Times broke a story that the Conference bill had added a provision that would benefit both Corker and Trump, personally. The particular provision in question allows real estate investors to get a special 20% tax rate like other small businesses \u2013 even without paying significant wages to anybody, unlike other businesses. This clearly helps Trump himself, who holds many assets that he simply licenses out to others to run. While Corker has publicly denied that the addition of this real estate benefit influenced his decision, its presence further underscores the cruelty of this bill \u2013 and the cruel familiarity of the process of generating it. The Republican plan privileges the wealthy \u2013 including the ones with large real estate holdings like the President \u2013 while largely ignoring the forgotten working men and women who voted for Trump. Some low- and middle-income taxpayers may initially get a small benefit from the plan, but all the individual cuts are set to expire by 2025 at the latest, and the largest gains will go to those at the top of the wealth scale. Mom, Pop -- you're the losers in this tax plan Meanwhile, the tax cut plan busts a $1.5 trillion hole in the deficit. Though Republican lawmakers estimate that it will be, in part, offset by increased economic growth, the plan will still add hundreds of billions \u2013 if not more \u2013 to the deficit over the next decade. It looks like this very fiscal gap will immediately call into question the stability of entitlement programs such as Social Security and Medicare, as Republicans like Paul Ryan, having just cut taxes, remember that they are fiscal conservatives after all. But what makes this process especially maddening is that Trump is violating one of his most fundamental campaign promises: to drain the swamp. This massive tax legislation is being developed and brokered in haste and secrecy \u2013 fundamental ingredients of a thriving swamp. It is also full of breaks for certain industries, an indication that lobbyists are playing a large role in influencing the final version of the bill. Take commercial real estate, to name a large and suspicious example. Real estate investors like Trump will see more generous depreciation schedules, continued deductibility for interest and lower tax rates on the business forms that hold their real estate, like real estate investment trusts \u2013 all without having to actually hire workers. Real estate is not the only happy industry this holiday season. The New York Times reports that \u201ccruise lines, craft beer, wine producers (even foreign ones), car dealers, private equity and oil and gas pipeline managers did particularly well.\u201d A former CEO's view: The GOP tax bill is both mean and stupid Wall Street gets a seat at the banquet, too. Remember all of Trump\u2019s campaign talk about closing the \u201ccarried interest\u201d loophole? This is a tax break that allows hedge fund managers to pay a favorable capital gains rate (20%) on their earnings \u2013 a benefit for the upper income that Trump pledged repeatedly to shut down when he was running for office. Somehow shutting that loophole did not make the final cut, either. The tax cut process, moving at breakneck speed, is also rife with apparent errors that will have to be corrected in due course, unless they just so happen to help some special interest. The Senate version of the bill, for example, had a $300 billion mistake in failing to adjust the corporate alternative minimum tax to keep pace with the general rate reduction. Who knows what other glitches may soon be discovered. If Corker, who claimed he hadn\u2019t seen the real estate provision in the text before announcing his support of the bill, is any indication, we can expect many more surprises to come to light in due time.  Just like Corker did not see a last minute provision vastly benefiting him, we will likely never know about the myriad of deals brokered in darkness over the last few weeks in Washington. That\u2019s the way swamps work. And they stink. If Trump had been serious about keeping his promise to drain the swamp, he would have allowed senators enough time to read the bill before pressuring them to decide how to vote on it. But if he had done that, the President might have had to think of something other than tax cuts to get his family for Christmas. And who can beat giving their kids millions in extra cash \u2013 especially when others are picking up the tab?",

The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. Confirming the warnings and worst fears of progressives, House Speaker Paul Ryan made it plain this week: the ultimate aim of Republican lawmakers \u2013 and their number one priority in January \u2013 is to shrink the Medicare program that provides health insurance to the elderly and disabled. \u201cNext year we\u2019re going to have to get back at entitlement reform,\u201d Ryan said on a Wisconsin radio talk show, calling Medicare the \u201cbiggest entitlement that\u2019s got to have reform.\u201d Sanders: 'Immoral' for GOP to target social safety nets That\u2019s code for resuming a decades-long fight against government-supported health care by conservatives, who fought bitterly against the creation of Medicare in 1965 and have been trying to cripple or kill the program ever since. Recall that the creation of health insurance for America\u2019s poor and elderly \u2013 something that President Harry Truman attempted, without success, in 1945, 1947 and 1949 \u2013 was frustrated at every turn by conservatives in both political parties. As CNN contributor Julian Zelizer has recounted, the program finally got passed following the Democratic landslide of 1964, when President Lyndon Johnson\u2019s re-election against Barry Goldwater swept commanding Democratic majorities into the House (295 seats) and Senate (68 seats). Democrats got the long-sought program for senior health care: in 1965 Johnson signed the Medicare bill into law with Truman sitting at his side. The ex-president was enrolled as the program\u2019s first member. But conservative opposition never wavered or waned. In the closing weeks before final passage of the Medicare bill, Ronald Reagan \u2013 then a rising star in conservative Republican politics \u2013 recorded a famous message calling Medicare \u201csocialism\u201d and urging voters to contact member of Congress and urge a \u201cno\u201d vote. Cancer patients turned away from clinics If Medicare should pass, Reagan warned, \u201cbehind it will come other federal programs that will invade every area of freedom as we have known it in this country. And if you don\u2019t do this and if I don\u2019t do it, one of these days we are going to spend our sunset years telling our children and our children\u2019s children, what it once was like in America when men were free.\u201d For a certain type of hard-right conservative Republican, Reagan\u2019s call remains relevant and urgent to this day.  Having failed to repeal Medicare outright \u2013 the program is wildly popular, serving more than 55 million seniors (about 15% of the US population, says AARP) and disabled Americans \u2013 Republicans have moved to a three-part \u201cstarve the beast\u201d strategy. Part one is to slash taxes and drastically lower the amount of revenue available to the federal government. The tax bill that GOP majorities recently approved in both houses of Congress accomplishes that nicely, adding $1 trillion to the federal budget deficit under the most optimistic economic scenario, according to the nonpartisan Joint Committee on Taxation. Part two of the plan is to suddenly recoil in horror at the fact of the budget deficit (yes, the same one that Republicans happily conjured up by cutting taxes). Ryan\u2019s radio interview is a step in that direction. \u201cFrankly, it\u2019s the health care entitlements that are the big drivers of our debt,\u201d he said \u2013 just days after happily adding a trillion to the tab with tax cuts. Mulvaney: Trump wants to protect entitlements Piling up debt and deficits sets the stage for the third and concluding strategy: to lower the debt by dialing back Medicare eligibility, lowering the benefits and otherwise crippling the program. Democrats warned about this throughout the debate over the tax cut bill, which passed without a single Democratic vote in the House or Senate. They must now gear up for a showdown with Ryan and other conservatives who are poised to take a big step in the direction of ending a program that Reagan Republicans wanted to eliminate from Day One.",

He writes frequently for CNN Opinion. Follow him on Twitter @FordVox. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his. Ford Vox: Politics, not concern for your health care, are driving the GOP's last-ditch effort to repeal Obamacare He says while actively undermining Obamacare, Trump has made sunny health care promises this disastrous bill doesn't deliver There\u2019s perhaps no clearer snapshot of the disconnect in D.C. than a week in which a small group of Democratic senators comes out swinging for a single-payer healthcare system, only to be blindsided by the news that a far larger pool of Republican senators are coalescing around yet another effort \u2013 the disastrous Graham-Cassidy bill \u2013 to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. It\u2019s as if everyone in Washington has given up on the idea of practical governance in favor of posturing for the benefit of their core political base. A hurricane\u2019s projected landfall is an example of a true deadline, one that really means do or die. September 30th, the date after which the Republican Senate can no longer use the budget reconciliation process to push through health care legislation by a simple majority, is an example of an artificial deadline \u2014 one that is about politics, not about improving anyone\u2019s health care. It\u2019s easy to see where Republicans\u2019 urgency about making that deadline comes from.  They are looking across the aisle at Bernie Sanders, who is drawing \u201cAmens\u201d for the concept that Medicare-for-all is the only way to achieve universal coverage, and pondering how they might negotiate anything with these Democrats. The GOP\u2019s fear is palpable. Republicans in Congress are getting an earful from constituents who\u2019ve swallowed endless lies from them about Obamacare since before its passage, folks who are hooked into a media echo chamber that can easily spawn GOP primary opponents to better conform to the party\u2019s \u201crepeal and replace\u201d promise. Trump to Senate: Vote again on Obamacare Another fabricated sense of urgency surrounds the idea that Obamacare\u2019s markets are rapidly crumbling. In fact the Congressional Budget Office makes it clear in a report last week that it\u2019s Trump himself who is destabilizing the ACA marketplaces. Trump\u2019s Department of Health and Human Services is cutting 90% of the budget from its enrollment campaign for 2018 (I\u2019ll advise you that open enrollment is November 1st through December 15th). Such efforts to cut down the customer base of ACA insurance plans are a key reason premiums will go up in 2018, and the other key factor \u2013 cited in an analysis of proposed insurance prices by the Kaiser Family Foundation \u2013 is all of the President\u2019s talk about not fulfilling the law\u2019s requirement to distribute subsidies to insurers, part of the law\u2019s careful balancing of risk that keeps insurers willing to play along. Yet despite the administration\u2019s best efforts, as of today every single county in the United States has an insurer offering plans on the ACA marketplace.  That\u2019s the single most powerful crystallization of the law\u2019s careful balancing of capitalism and public utility. All of these companies have a choice, and they ultimately choose to sell insurance on the marketplaces because they prefer to make money. Of course, this situation can only hold so long under the weight of a four-year, post-truth presidency enabled by a Republican Congress. Sanders: Trump wants to sabotage health care Which brings us to the post-truth Graham-Cassidy repeal bill currently on offer. If it collects 50 Republican senators who are irresponsible enough to sign on without a CBO score, it would surely get a tie-breaking vote from the Vice President, a rubber stamp in the House and an instant signature by the President. \u201cIf a politician controls the dollar, the system lines up to serve the politician,\u201d Sen. Bill Cassidy (R-LA) stated at his September 13 press conference discussing the bill. \u201cIf the patient controls the dollar, the system lines up to serve her. The theme of what we are trying to do is to give the patient the power.\u201d I\u2019m not aware of any politicians who\u2019ve lined their pockets thanks to Obamacare. As an informed citizen, I don\u2019t know what Senator Cassidy is talking about. But as doctor, I can tell you this: Cassidy\u2019s bill fails his own \u201cJimmy Kimmel Test,\u201d the promise he made to the late-night host whose son was born with a congenital heart defect, receiving very expensive care at Cedars Sinai. Cassidy said he\u2019d only support legislation if a \u201cchild born with a congenital heart disease (would) be able to get everything she or he would need in that first year of life\u201d even if costs exceed \u201ca certain amount.\u201d The patient is in fact powerless under the Cassidy-Graham bill, which gives the states block grants to administer healthcare for the poor and disabled, under whatever mechanisms they wish, and near complete freedom to enact their own rules with regards to the quality of private insurance plans sold in their states. Pence: Health care 'ain't over by a long shot' Most importantly, states can let insurers charge what they like to cover sicker individuals. Kimmel\u2019s son, despite his heart condition, won the birth lottery in that his future access to healthcare isn\u2019t in question \u2014 his father is rich. But the Jimmy Kimmel test is supposed to apply to everyone. Most Americans with congenital heart defects can easily find themselves priced out of insurance plans that weigh medical risk factors. To people with health conditions to manage, the United States would no longer be a place of free movement and opportunity. They would become a second tier of the citizenry, constrained by the limitations of a very different, balkanized land. President Trump, too, promised Americans he\u2019d replace Obamacare with a system that still guaranteed people with pre-existing conditions access to good coverage. \u201cI am going to take care of everybody. I don\u2019t care if it costs me votes or not,\u201d Trump told \u201c60 Minutes\u201d while campaigning for the office. After the election, he told the Washington Post, \u201cThere was a philosophy in some circles that if you can\u2019t pay for it, you don\u2019t get it. That\u2019s not going to happen with us.\u201d But President Trump\u2019s and Senator Cassidy\u2019s sunny promises bear no relation to the Graham-Cassidy disaster that\u2019s bearing down on the United States. Trump: I'll turn to Dems if I need to For the President, his behavior surrounding an ACA repeal is no different than his unreal stance on many other critical policy debates. On DACA, he also promises something better than the rules now in place, but similarly he\u2019s ginned up urgency by issuing a deadline by which he\u2019ll revoke the current presidential policy. Just like with Obamacare, he\u2019s trying to save the nation from a disaster he\u2019s creating, a feat of propaganda that only works on those trapped in his echo chamber. As for congressional Republicans like Bill Cassidy, they need to serve the needs of the people in their states, not their personal ideologies. Cassidy could start by listening to Louisiana\u2019s Department of Health Secretary, Dr. Rebekah Gee, who wrote the Senator (himself a physician) about his bill\u2019s impact on their shared state. She points to Louisiana\u2019s \u201chigh burden of extreme poverty,\u201d that necessitates a strong Medicaid program and how the bill allows insurers \u201cto charge individuals more based on age and health status (which) would inevitably increase the cost of care for those who need it the most \u2013 likely driving these individuals out of the workforce and into the increasingly tattered safety net of public assistance.\u201d Gee\u2019s letter talks about the real people Obamacare is helping right now. Republicans and Democrats would do well to work on improving this law together, which is well made enough that it keeps ticking along, doing its core job. Such real work of governance gets fewer retweets than declarations of ideological purity, but a bit less fervor from the fan base is a small price to pay for the greater good of the country.",

            "article_content": "Editor\u2019s Note: Julian Zelizer, a history and public affairs professor at Princeton University and a CNN political analyst, is the author of \u201cThe Fierce Urgency of Now: Lyndon Johnson, Congress, and the Battle for the Great Society.\u201d He\u2019s co-host of the \u201cPolitics & Polls\u201d podcast. The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. Julian Zelizer: The idea of bipartisan health care reform seems highly unlikely, but there is historical precedent for it In 1983, Republicans and Democrats came together to save Social Security benefits Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell surprised the White House and many Republicans last week when he floated the idea that his party might end up working with Democrats if they fail to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act. McConnell\u2019s words sound like more of a threat than a promise, particularly to intransigent Republicans who might fear that a bipartisan bill would be far less palatable to them and to the GOP base. Latest health care bill collapses following Moran, Lee defections But let\u2019s imagine there is something to McConnell\u2019s idea. What if he is able and willing to mobilize a coalition of Democrats and moderate Republicans such as Senator Susan Collins to fix the Affordable Care Act through subsidies and other reforms that stabilize the health insurance markets? It has happened before. One of President Ronald Reagan\u2019s biggest defeats early in his administration came on his proposal to cut Social Security benefits for early retirees. When he included this measure in his budget, congressional Democrats snapped to attention. Dejected after Reagan\u2019s 1980 victory over President Jimmy Carter, Democrats criticized Reagan for trying to slash the benefits that elderly Americans depended on. But Reagan didn\u2019t back away forever. In 1982, Social Security was back on the agenda when experts warned that Franklin Delano Roosevelt\u2019s greatest legacy faced a massive budgetary imbalance in the near term that threatened the program. The government would be spending more on benefits every month than it was raising through payroll taxes. Reagan, still stinging from his defeat, established a bipartisan commission to offer recommendations about how to fix the program. Reagan appointed Alan Greenspan to serve as the chairman of the 15-person commission. The panel, which had more Republicans than Democrats, reviewed every possible solution. Democrats like Claude Pepper of Florida warned that the commission was stacked with conservatives and would not produce anything that his side could accept. Why US health care costs defy common sense And other Democrats warned that the commission would have trouble making recommendations that were acceptable to their party. After all, the GOP was the party of Reagan, who had repeatedly expressed his opposition to the basic structure of Social Security, as well as Medicare. In the 1982 midterm elections that took place while the commission met, many House Democrats \u2013 who picked up 26 seats \u2013 ran on the saying that, \u201cIt\u2019s not fair \u2026 It\u2019s Republican\u201d in reference to the Social Security plan and other conservative domestic policies. Democrats handed out bumper stickers that read, \u201cSave Social Security \u2013 vote Democratic.\u201d The commission came back with a recommendation to put the program on sound footing. The report \u201crejected proposals to make the Social Security program a voluntary one.\u201d  But there were concerns that partisan pressures would sink the commission\u2019s recommendations. Greenspan\u2019s panel proposed increasing Social Security revenues by taxing a larger number of employees, accelerating tax rates, taxing some Social Security benefits, delaying cost of living adjustments and more. Reagan expressed his support for their recommendations, saying, \u201cWell, sometimes, even here in Washington, the cynics are wrong. Through compromise and cooperation, the members of the commission overcame their differences.\u201d Senate Majority Leader Robert Dole, the stalwart conservative from Kansas, had made a number of statements indicating his support for modest reforms to save the program, including an op-ed in The New York Times published on January 3. Dole argued that \u201cThrough a combination of relatively modest steps, including some acceleration of already scheduled taxes and some reduction in the rate of future benefit increases, the system can be saved.\u201d He added that \u201cWhen it is, much of the credit, rightfully, will belong to this President and his party.\u201d Santorum: Trump needs to step up on health care Democratic Senator Patrick Moynihan of New York, who was on the commission with Dole and had just been sworn in to a second term, was energized by Dole\u2019s op-ed. Moynihan approached Dole on the Senate floor and asked: \u201cAre we going to let this commission die without giving it one more try?\u201d The op-ed was crucial to Moynihan, who recalled that until that point Republicans \u201cwere talking about scrapping the system.\u201d White House Chief of Staff James Baker organized a \u201cgang of five\u201d (also called the \u201cgang of nine\u201d for those who included the four White House staffers who participated) with members from both parties who entered into an intense, secretive set of meetings to find a resolution. Hardly \u201canyone expected the negotiations to succeed,\u201d according to the Times given the intensity of partisan division. Their meetings were conducted behind closed doors, leaving some to fear the kind of wheeling and dealing that was taking place. In his classic account of the reforms, \u201cArtful Work: The Politics of Social Security Reform,\u201d political scientist Paul Light wrote that the closed-door negotiations were essential to success so that members could make \u201cpainful choices\u201d on key issues. Other than a long break on January 8 to watch the Washington Redskins compete in the NFL playoffs, the negotiations were nonstop. In the end, both sides agreed that the final deal had to inflict some political pain on both parties \u2013 that was the only way it could work. They reached a deal on January 15. The administration found support from such congressional Democrats as Speaker Tip O\u2019Neill who was eager to join the president in this effort to save a key part of the social safety net. Donald Trump has a chance to step up for a signature win Congress eventually passed legislation that raised the payroll tax, raised the retirement age from 65 to 67, delayed the cost of living adjustment for six months and required government workers to pay for Social Security. The Social Security Amendments of 1983, a $168 billion package, remain a landmark moment in the history of the program. It made the program solvent for several more decades. Reagan said the legislation \u201cdemonstrates for all time our nation\u2019s ironclad commitment to Social Security.\u201d He continued, \u201cIt assures the elderly that America will always keep the promises made in troubled times a half a century ago. It assures those who are still working that they, too, have a pact with the future.\u201d In 2017, repeating this success with health care seems almost inconceivable. The polarization in Washington has become so much worse that it is hard to imagine the two parties coming together on any issue of this significance. House Republicans who are part of the Freedom Caucus and their allies in the Senate will have little appetite to join Democrats on any initiative. Shifting to the center feels to them like the ultimate act of political betrayal. Any Republican willing to sign on to such a deal would face great political risks back home. Repealing Obamacare has been so important symbolically that compromising on this question could be politically disastrous for Republican members of Congress. Collins still a 'no' on GOP health care bill Democrats will likewise have little appetite to hand President Trump a victory of this sort. The utter failure of Republicans to deliver on repealing the ACA, with the realization that much of the program is far more popular than conservatives believed it to be, has been one of the main rallying points for the Democratic Party. Continuing to hammer away on this issue, rather than giving Republicans a victory, could be critical to success in the 2018 election, allowing them to both save the program and regain control of the House. So why compromise right now? And both parties must grapple with the reality that millions of Americans who now have health coverage are likely facing rising costs. Yet maybe the politics will move Washington in the most unexpected of directions. Perhaps McConnell will see that bipartisanship might in fact offer his party the best way to save itself on health care and to move on to more appetizing issues, such as cutting taxes for business and investors. This could be a legacy-making moment for him as a congressional leader, even if there are big short-term political costs. For Trump, it could allow him to finally claim a domestic victory and give some credence to the notion that he is a maverick. Should he defy the conservative Republicans, he might come out of this with more leverage to move the party on other issues. Democrats could break the lock that Tea Party Republicans have had on Capitol Hill since 2010 and create a precedent for other sorts of alliances, such as a deal on rebuilding infrastructure, that go against the conventional wisdom. Republicans who locked in march step with the conservative caucus would know that the possibility of bipartisanship was a real option.  Democrats face the real risk that if gridlock prevents Congress from fixing the program, the costs of premiums will continue to rise and more insurers will pull out of health care markets, leaving the party to shoulder the responsibility of these problems. Instead, through a deal, the Democrats could come out of this bruising battle with a new and improved ACA. In entering this alliance, they could save a health care program that is central to their party\u2019s recent rule, and offer ongoing evidence \u2013 in the midterms and the next presidential election \u2013 of what they can accomplish when they are in power. The President could immediately generate some good press coverage by creating a bipartisan commission to offer recommendations for fixing the ACA. The odds of any of this happening are slim. Intense partisan polarization is not some imaginary force in national politics \u2013 it defines our era. Yet every now and then, as the nation saw in 1983, both parties can find a way to join hands with the opposition in ways that benefit both of their interests and help citizens achieve more security in their lives.",

The opinions expressed in this commentary are his. Jeffrey Sachs: Political system caters to health care lobby, not to people's needs Sachs offers 10-point plan for health care for all at lower cost US health care costs are out of sight, more than $10,000 per person per year, compared with around $5,000 per person in Canada, Germany and France. Obamacare expanded coverage without controlling costs. The Republican plan would ruthlessly and cruelly limit coverage without controlling costs. Of the two options, Obamacare is vastly more just. The Republican plan is ghastly. But America has a much better choice: health for all at far lower costs. This might seem like an out-of-reach goal or a political slogan, but it is neither. Every other rich country uses the same medical technology, gets the same or better health outcomes, and pays vastly lower sums. Why the disparity? Health care in America is big business, and in America big business means big lobbying and big campaign contributions, the public interest be damned. Health care is our biggest economic sector, far ahead of the military, Wall Street and the auto and tech industries. It is pushing 18% of national income, compared with 10% to 12% of national income in the other high-income countries. In line with its economic size, it ranks first in total lobbying, with a recorded $152 million in lobbying spending in 2017 and an estimated $273 million in federal campaign contributions in the 2016 election cycle, divided roughly equally between the parties. Cory Booker stages sit-in on Capitol steps Both parties have therefore ducked the hard work of countering the health care sector\u2019s monopoly power.  Health care spending is now at $10,000 per person per year, roughly twice or more the total of other high-income countries, or a staggering $3.25 trillion a year. We should aim to save at least $1 trillion in total annual outlays, roughly $3,000 per person per year, through a series of feasible, fair and reasonable measures to limit monopoly power. Our system would look a lot more like that of the other more successful and less expensive nations. Here\u2019s a 10-point plan Congress should consider. First, move to capitation for Medicare, Medicaid and the tax-exempt private health insurance plans. Under capitation, hospitals and physician groups receive an annual \u201cglobal budget\u201d based on their patient population, not reimbursement on a fee-for-service basis. Second, limit the compensation of hospital CEOs and top managers. The pay of not-for-profit hospital CEOs and top managers, for example, could be capped at $1 million per year. Third, require Medicare and other public providers to negotiate drug prices on a rational basis, taking account of research and development incentives and the manufacturing costs of the medicines. Ryan: I would not bet against McConnell Fourth, use emergency power to override patents (such as compulsory licensing of patent-protected drugs) to set maximum prices on drugs for public health emergencies (such as for HIV and hepatitis C). Fifth, radically simplify regulatory procedures for bringing quality generic drugs to the market, including through importation, by simplifying Food and Drug Administration procedures. Sixth, facilitate \u201ctask shifting\u201d from doctors to lower-cost health workers for routine procedures, especially when new computer applications can support the decision process. Seven, in all public and private plans, cap the annual payment of deductibles and cost-sharing by households to a limited fraction of household income, as is done in many high-income countries. Eight, use part of the annual saving of $1 trillion to expand home visits for community-based health  care to combat the epidemics of obesity, opioids, mental illness and others. Nine, rein in the advertising and other marketing by the pharmaceutical and fast-food industries that has created, alone among the high-income world, a nation of addiction and obesity. CBO scores Senate health bill; GOP debates it Ten, offer a public plan to meet these conditions to compete with private plans. Medicare for all is one such possibility. There really no mystery to why America\u2019s health industry needs a drastic corrective. Visit the website of your local not-for-profit hospital system. There\u2019s a good chance the CEO will be earning millions per year, sometimes $10 million or more. Or go to treat your hepatitis C with  Gilead drug Sofosbuvir. The pills list for $84,000 per 12-week dose, while their production cost is a little over $100, roughly one-thousandth of the list price. Or go in for an MRI, and your hospital might have an $8,000 billable price for a procedure that costs $500 in a discount clinic outside your provider network. All of these are examples of the vast market power of the health care industry. The sector is designed to squeeze consumers and the government for all they\u2019re worth (and sometimes more, driving many into bankruptcy). As a result, the sector is awash in profits and compensation levels, and the stock prices of the health care industry are soaring. In the meantime, human and financial resources are pulled away from low-cost (but also low-profit) disease prevention, such as low-cost community health workers and wellness counselors who work within the community, including household visits. Mom on Medicaid cuts: It's a punch in the gut The health care sector is a system of monopolies and oligopolies \u2013 that is, there are few producers in the marketplace and few limits on market power. Government shovels out the money in its own programs and via tax breaks for private plans without controls on the market power. And it\u2019s getting worse. Every other high-income country has solved this problem. Most hospitals are government-owned, while most of the rest are not for profit, but without allowing egregious salaries for top management. Drug prices are regulated. Patents are respected, but drug prices are negotiated. None of this is rocket science.

The problem is not our intelligence. The problem is our corrupt political system, which caters to the health care lobby, not to the needs of the people.",

The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. Julian Zelizer: Senate bill to repeal Obamacare a reminder of GOP's shift to right Dozens of Republican legislators voted for Medicare and Medicaid in the 1960s In 1965, 13 Senate and 70 House Republicans joined Democrats to pass the Social Security Amendments that created Medicare and Medicaid. Many Republicans in the House and Senate took this vote kicking and screaming, but in the end, they joined the Democratic majority to create the largest expansion of government health care coverage in American history until the Affordable Care Act. Thursday, after deliberating in the dark of Senate office buildings, Republicans in the upper chamber, led by Mitch McConnell, signaled they will join their House counterparts in dismantling the Affordable Care Act \u2013 thereby stripping away health care coverage for millions of Americans. This will not be an easy vote for the 20 Republican senators whose states have expanded Medicaid under the ACA, and where the changes brought about by the program are quite popular. There are nine Republican senators running for re-election in 2020 whose states have expanded the program. McConnell is telling these Republicans to fall on their partisan sword. Although the Senate version of the bill will offer some slight modifications to soften the blow, such as keeping subsidies for individual coverage of low-income Americans, overall it looks similar and, in some respects, it is even tougher. It cuts deeply into Medicaid coverage, eliminates crucial taxes and gets rid of the vital individual mandate essential to making this insurance system work and keeping it affordable. The Senate proposal delays the phaseout of the Medicaid expansion but then makes much deeper cuts than the House. President Donald Trump might have described the House bill as \u201cmean,\u201d but Senate Republicans seem to be just fine traveling along the same path. The Senate version of repealing the Affordable Care Act is a powerful reminder of just how much the Republican Party has changed since the 1960s as legislators in the House and Senate have shifted far to the right. To be sure, back in 1965 there were many conservative Republicans who opposed Medicare. Ronald Reagan spun a record that warned that Presidents Kennedy and Johnson\u2019s Medicare proposal, which provided hospital insurance to the elderly paid for by Social Security taxes, was an opening wedge to socialism. Sen. Barry Goldwater made his opposition to Medicare a key theme in his presidential campaign against Johnson. \u201cHaving given our pensioners their medical care in kind, why not food baskets, why not public housing accommodations, why not vacation resorts, why not a ration of cigarettes for those who smoke and beer for those who drink?\u201d Goldwater asked. Medicaid works -- let's keep it that way Republicans only proposed their alternatives to Medicare after the landslide Democratic victories in 1964 made it inevitable that some version of the bill was going to pass. Even in the final vote on the conference committee report, 68 House and 17 Senate Republicans voted against the legislation. But other Republicans made a different choice. Faced with the fact that elderly Americans struggled to afford basic health insurance coverage, liberal Republicans such as New York\u2019s Jacob Javits had been a driving force in the push for federal health care coverage. While many Republicans opposed the administration\u2019s Medicare proposal, they did support an alternative in the House, sponsored by ranking Ways and Means Committee Republican John Byrnes, that provided  insurance to cover the cost of doctors supported by government funds and contributions from beneficiaries. Many experts believed this plan was actually more generous than the administration\u2019s. Even the most conservative wing of the Republican Party pushed for health care for the poor, administered by the states in cooperation with the federal government, which today we know of as Medicaid. British novelist L.P. Hartley wrote, \u201cThe past is a foreign country,\u201d and that seems especially true of the Republican Party in the 1960s, given its transformation to what we see today. Liberals and moderates have vanished from the GOP conferences in the House and Senate. Conservative Republicans slowly took over most of the key leadership positions and committee chairs, and there have been fewer and fewer dissenting votes on roll call votes that lean to the right. For GOP, health care is a marathon In 2010, the tea party was born and institutionalized this rightward drift among Republicans in the House. Members aligned with the tea party formed the Freedom Caucus in 2015, and they have been a force with which to reckon. Under the leadership of Jim Jordan and Mark Meadows, they have created a powerful organizational mechanism within the House that refuses to budge on key issues and that resists the pressure to compromise on core principles. The caucus is willing to go to extremes to pursue its objectives (threatening, for instance, to send the nation into default over disputes about spending) and it has taken down leaders, such as Speaker John Boehner, who opposed it. For all the talk about McConnell being the master legislator, it looks like his ultimate solution with health care has been to concede to the House plan, tinkering around the edges rather than doing anything to really satisfy the concerns of the Republicans from states where the Medicaid expansion under the ACA and regulations such as the coverage of pre-existing problems remain extremely popular. After emerging from their secret meetings, McConnell is giving Republicans a stark choice \u2013 vote for the draconian changes passed by the House or get nothing at all. McConnell\u2019s decision is evidence that the Freedom Caucus rules the roost on Capitol Hill. The political problem for Republicans is that the current versions of the health care reform are incredibly unpopular, according to almost every poll. Once the possible effects of the bill are felt, it is likely the anger toward the legislation could intensify, causing serious problems in the 2018 midterm elections and in the next presidential election. A vote in favor of this health care bill could easily alienate Republican voters who worry about the extremism in the party, and the chaos in the Oval Office, but have remained loyal to their party. Whether Democrats can take advantage of the fallout, that\u2019s a different question, one that remains unclear after this week\u2019s special election in Georgia. And it is also possible that other issues such as the economy will overwhelm the anger about the health care vote.  The House and Senate versions of health care reform reveal a Republican Party that is willing to go very far to gut the legacies of the New Deal and Great Society as well as President Barack Obama\u2019s domestic agenda. This will be a defining vote for the GOP that puts the party on record for where it stands on protecting Americans from the vicissitudes of health care markets. For all the attention paid to Trump, his tweets and the controversy over Russia, the reality is that in today\u2019s Washington the real story is the power of the Freedom Caucus.",

The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. On Tuesday, President Trump is expected to announce $800 billion in cuts to Medicaid Julian Zelizer: These cuts run counter to the President's populist platform and will be scorned by much of the electorate In the budget that President Donald Trump is expected to release Tuesday, CNN has reported that there will be $800 billion in cuts to Medicaid, which assumes that the reductions contained in the House health care bill become law. With all of the frenzied coverage of President Trump\u2019s trip overseas and the ongoing investigation into \u201cRussiagate,\u201d one of the biggest stories of the day might have slipped under the radar. But now it\u2019s lighting up on Twitter. The reason: the proposed cuts to Medicaid would be devastating to low-income adults and their children, as well as the disabled and elderly Americans who depend on these benefits to survive. Indeed, if some voters believed that President Trump might start moderating his tone or moving closer to the political center, this budget should throw some cold water on those kinds of predictions. And the proposal could have deep ramifications for the political strength of the Republican Party. Since its enactment in 1965 as part of President Lyndon Johnson\u2019s Great Society, a sweeping program of domestic reforms, Medicaid has emerged as a centerpiece of the US social safety net.  Although the program started as a small and insignificant complement to Medicare, over the decades it has grown in terms of the types of benefits provided and the number of Americans covered. Not only are there over 70 million Americans who depend on the health care benefits that Medicaid provides, but state and local governments as well as health care providers (hospitals, insurance companies, physicians) all depend on this steady revenue flow into our troubled medical system. Who gets hurt by GOP's 'pro-life' hypocrisy In contrast to the history of many social programs, this has been a case where stigmatized benefits that help the \u201cpoor\u201d and the \u201cdisadvantaged\u2019 evolved into an enormously popular program that has broad political support. This is the reason that so many Senate and even House Republicans trembled when the Freedom Caucus worked with the administration to place draconian Medicaid cuts into the health care bill. These Republicans understand that cutting Medicaid in this way is different than abstract warnings about the problems with big government. Taking benefits away from Americans is as difficult politically as creating new social programs. These proposed cuts are very real. Lower-income Americans would lose access to vital health care benefits that come from Medicaid. Children from these communities would see their access to health care curtailed with cuts to the Children\u2019s Health Insurance Program (CHIP), a Medicaid program. And state governments would struggle as federal funds from Medicaid dry up. States would receive Medicaid as a block grant rather than open-ended entitlement. Even if more citizens needed funds, the amount of federal funds they received would be capped. Dad with diabetic son confronts congressman The Medicaid cuts come on top of many other proposed reductions that target Americans with the fewest resources. The budget is expected to cut food stamps (a program that over 40 million people received in 2016) and other anti-poverty programs. The budget is also said to include cuts to the Earned Income Tax Credit and the Child Tax Credit, which are tax breaks that have been very beneficial to working Americans who are struggling to stay afloat. If President Trump was serious about being a populist who stood up for struggling Americans, this budget indicates otherwise. Coupled with his proposed tax cuts, these domestic policies would entail a massive redistribution of wealth from the poor to the rich. Passing this budget won\u2019t be easy. As a result of the political scandal engulfing his administration, Trump is a severely weakened President. Even his standing among Republicans has finally started to slip. With members of Congress watching each day to see the latest news about Russia and potential obstruction of justice charges, it will be difficult for the President to whip up the necessary votes, especially for spending cuts that are not very popular with large parts of the electorate. Out of the 52 Senate Republicans, 20 of them represent states that expanded Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act. Heroin addicts are your problem In addition, Republican senators and representatives from swing states and districts may be concerned that voting for Medicaid cuts could hurt their chances of re-election in 2018. At this point in a turbulent presidency, Republicans are looking for Trump to say and do things that will help them solidify their shaky support rather than cause more tensions within their constituencies. They are tired of going to town hall meetings where they encounter furious residents who don\u2019t like the direction of the nation. Nothing will do more to energize Democrats than this budget. Even the investigation pales in comparison to what proposed spending cuts like these mean to the opposition party. With this budget, Democrats gain a very clear understanding of what\u2019s at stake if Republicans retain control of Congress and President Trump goes on to finish his term. The risks are not simply about corruption and undermining the reputation of the nation\u2019s leadership \u2013 the risks are about serious slashes to basic social programs that Americans depend on. For all the rhetoric about which party cares more about struggling Americans, punitive cuts such as these make it more difficult for Republicans to claim the high ground.  Today, President Lyndon Johnson must be shedding some tears from his grave. As he watches President Trump attempt to go even further than President Ronald Reagan on dismantling the welfare state, he would be deeply saddened given his understanding of what these kinds of programs meant to \u201cmiddle America.\u201d Medicaid and Medicare were not about providing government \u201chandouts,\u201d nor where they about accepting some sort of nanny state. The programs were designed to ensure that all Americans had basic access to health care so that they could be good citizens and participate in the marketplace. Our current President is moving in the opposite direction, and this budget indicates what his real priorities are despite all the bluster from the campaign trail. The problem for President Trump is that this budget, coming when it does in this presidency, might end up being more a part of his undoing than his triumphant political success.",

Jonathan Tasini: After callous vote, people will organize to demand health care as a right Fight for single-payer system would distinguish Democrats from GOP, he says Democrats are denouncing Thursday\u2019s House vote to repeal Obamacare as a huge step backward. As Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi put it on Twitter and reiterated in remarks on the House floor, \u201cEvery Republican who votes for #Trumpcare will have it tattooed on their forehead. They will be held accountable.\u201d The best way to hold them accountable, though, instead of decrying the passage of this bill \u2013 which has almost no chance of passing the Senate into law \u2013 is for Democrats to see it as an opportunity. Rather than try to defend a flawed program such as Obamacare, they should crusade for health care as a basic human right. And there\u2019s a simple way to make that happen \u2013 institute \u201cMedicare for all.\u201d Republicans will never go for it, but there is no better banner to carry forward as the party works to build support for a Democratic takeover of Congress in 2018. The repeal of the Affordable Care Act squeaked through the House, but Republican leaders forced a bad vote on many of its caucus members. The bill is dead on arrival in the Senate because every week since the election, the ACA has become more popular among people, particularly those with existing illnesses who, no matter what their political affiliation, feared being left with no insurance. The pittance thrown into the repeal to pay for high-risk pools won\u2019t do much. The end result: Millions of people will now lose insurance, as the Congressional Budget Office found in an earlier version of the bill, and, thus, Americans will be sicker \u2013 and many will die. There is plenty of competition for the award for \u201cDumbest Policy Debate,\u201d but the fight over health care has got to rank close to the top. If politicians of both parties could put ideology aside and choose smart, moral economics, they would embrace the only sane solution: a single-payer system. If we can shift the debate, admittedly a huge hurdle, there is a simple solution that could be done virtually overnight: Establish a single-payer system by just removing Medicare\u2019s age requirement. Underneath the immediate debate lies the unfortunate truth that, when it comes to health care coverage that can mean the difference between life or death, Americans face unpalatable options. On the one hand is a Republican Party that doesn\u2019t view national health care as a right. The party has always opposed Medicaid and Medicare, seeing them as a sign of weakness in the country\u2019s moral fiber. The GOP\u2019s basic view is that if you can\u2019t summon up the money to pay free-market prices, well, that\u2019s your own fault. That said, the ACA was never a panacea. To be sure, millions of people gained coverage under the ACA, and a wide range of benefits created a framework of protections. But prices are going up and the ACA continued to allow hundreds of billions of dollars to be drained from people\u2019s pockets, suck capital from the bottom line of companies and, overall, hobble the economy by letting insurers, along with the drug companies, cost us roughly 17% of our gross domestic product. Think tank on GOP health bill: Coverage to plummet, cancer treatment costs to skyrocket The truth is Democrats have bungled health care for a quarter of a century. Both the Clinton administration in the 1990s and the Obama administration made the same fundamental error: Both presidents tried to erect a system that let insurance companies continue to dictate health care costs. Ideologically, Barack Obama, and the Clintons before him, believed in the so-called free market with a friendly face. You could see that in their fervent embrace of bad trade deals, deregulation and \u201cresponsible\u201d capitalism. Democrats also have fallen in love with massive corporate campaign contributions, millions of dollars of which have come from insurers and drug companies. But the truth is Medicare is one of the most successful and efficient government programs ever created in the country\u2019s history. It operates at a 2% to 3% administrative cost, which should be the envy of every penny-pinching politician. I argued recently that every company in the country should be for this approach because of the massive cost savings. Republicans, pay attention: You don\u2019t have to be a left-winger longing for European-style health care \u201csocialism\u201d to embrace \u201cMedicare for all.\u201d Australia, currently governed by a center-right government, continues to manage a national, single-payer system. Back in the 1980s, after a vigorous national debate, Australia resolved to join other nations by placing the task of health care in the hands of a single-payer: the government. Australia cut its cost of health care dramatically to about 9% of GDP. Today, no Australian business would seriously advocate abandoning its system and taking on the cost madness of an onerous American health care scheme. Some Democrats argue that America is \u201cdifferent\u201d from other countries and that difference \u2013 presumably the resistance to creating broad social safety nets like most advanced countries \u2013 accounts for the health care system we have today, and the need to accept an inferior solution. Similarly, some Democrats also say it\u2019s not politically feasible to enact single-payer because there isn\u2019t enough public support. Both arguments fail to be convincing, as seen in the strength of public support out there for \u201cMedicare for all.\u201d When framed as a choice between health care as a right versus the rights of insurance companies, single-payer has had strong majority support. Moreover, on the heels of many defeats the party has suffered in the past decade, it\u2019s worth noting it is a fight for single-payer \u201cMedicare for all\u201d that would distinguish the Democratic Party very clearly from Republicans \u2013 a distinction between the two parties on economic issues that is not evident today to many Americans, including some who voted for Donald Trump. Posing the choice as the people versus the insurance companies, a true opposition party \u2013 meaning, opposition to an economic system that is bankrupting Americans \u2013 would mass millions of people in the streets and make single-payer the single issue to drive voters to the polls in 2018.  Health care should never be left to the free market (an aside: nor should other parts of the economy, but let\u2019s leave that for another day). This is life and death. It should be a right, from cradle to grave, guaranteed by the government. Indeed, in this callous vote, which will cause millions to choose between buying food or staying healthy, we may end up eventually on a better path. People will organize to demand health care from cradle to grave as a right, toss out politicians who do the bidding of powerful economic forces and, most important, reinvigorate the role of government as the guardian of a decent society.",

The opinions expressed in this commentary are his own. On Thursday, House Republicans narrowly passed a bill to repeal Obamacare Julian Zelizer: This victory shows the damage Trump and Republicans can do to Obama's legacy when they work together Today\u2019s vote in the House of Representatives should be a loud wake-up call for anyone who has been dismissing President Trump. The vote to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act demonstrates the serious threat that the President, when he is able to work in tandem with the Republican Congress, poses to President Obama\u2019s legacy. Despite the conventional wisdom that it is almost impossible to dismantle domestic programs once they are up and running, the House just took a big step toward doing so. The legislation that moved through the House would eliminate many key components of the Affordable Care Act. It would get rid of the individual mandate that requires individuals to purchase health insurance or face a penalty. States would be allowed to obtain waivers to remove requirements on insurance companies to provide \u201cessential health benefits,\u201d including protecting people with pre-existing conditions. The last-minute compromise would provide money to help these Americans pay for more costly insurance, but, most experts agree, not nearly enough to address the problem. Perhaps most damaging of all to lower-income Americans, the Medicaid expansion, which has been essential to expanding insurance coverage, would be phased out. In addition, states would be allowed to receive Medicaid funds as a \u201cblock grant\u201d which would result in steep cuts since the change would end the federal guarantee that every person who applied for benefits and was eligible would receive them. Under the block grants, states would have more authority to restrict eligibility and slash benefits. Obamacare repeal is an opportunity for Democrats These changes to Medicaid could also be damaging for the elderly, since Medicaid \u2013 not Medicare \u2013 covers a significant portion of nursing home care. The vote in the House was a pivotal moment for President Trump. To be sure, the prospects for passing this bill in the Senate remain difficult. Senate Republicans are not excited about moving forward with this extremely conservative measure and fear the electoral consequences of this vote. And Republicans will certainly be hearing from angry voters in the coming week about the benefits that they would be losing. Nobody is certain how the CBO will score this measure, which means that the implications of the legislation remain unclear. Nor is it certain that Senate Republicans will be able to use the budget reconciliation process, which prohibits a filibuster. If the legislation is not deficit neutral or if the parliamentarian decides that the waivers are not related to the budget, Senate Democrats will be able to filibuster the bill. Yet Democrats should not be too confident. There will be a lot of partisan pressure on Republicans in the upper chamber to finish the job. Senator Mitch McConnell and his colleagues will realize that a victory would give President Trump and the party an enormous boost in his political standing. The legislation would strike a blow at the heart of President Obama\u2019s expansion of the social safety net. A complete victory on health care would also generate substantial political momentum for Republicans to move forward on other much-desired measures like a massive supply-side tax cut and legislative deregulations on energy markets. Democrats sing 'Goodbye' after vote Senator McConnell will do everything that he can to find ways to make this work. The same dynamics and dealmaking at play in the final hours of the House deliberation could be at work in the Senate as well. All of this is to say that those who have been dismissing President Trump at the end of his first 100 days are greatly downplaying the impact that he can still have. The same radical possibilities that were evident in the days that followed the historic election, when Speaker Ryan claimed that President Trump had earned a mandate and most Republicans fell in line, are very much in play. Yes, President Trump\u2019s tweets are outlandish and insulting; yes, he failed miserably on the legislative front in the first months of his presidency; and yes, the President and his advisors sometimes seem to have no idea about what they are doing. But that doesn\u2019t mean that the conditions are not still ripe for this President to push through a radically conservative agenda. United government in an era of intense partisan polarization is a powerful force. Republicans are chomping at the bit for this President to send them legislation that will dismantle the welfare state, strip free markets of regulations and cut taxes. Jimmy Kimmel is right on health care President Trump has been making considerable progress through executive actions and, with this vote, we see that if he gets his act together and focuses on legislation, he will find Republican colleagues who are prepared to take big steps to support him. In the House, enough moderate Republicans were willing to accept this compromise while the Freedom Caucus moved away from its all-or-nothing approach to reach a deal on this bill. In the final days of the debate, the Democratic activists who were so successful in blocking legislation the first time around were caught off guard. Democrats might be feeling like George Foreman when he fell victim to Muhammad Ali\u2019s rope-a-dope strategy in 1974. The Democrats spent the last few months taking many swings at the President and keeping him against the ropes. It looked like President Trump was politically bruised and battered. But at the very moment that Democrats were feeling confident, President Trump struck back with a vengeance. At least at this moment, the Democrats are the party laying on the ground. This presidency is far from over. The stakes of what takes place in the next few months are enormous. Democrats should take this vote as a lesson that this White House and Congress can still pack a powerful punch. Conservatives will come out of this decision, as well as the executive order easing up restrictions on the political activities of religious organizations, feeling energized and determined. As a party, Republicans will feel better about what they can accomplish with Trump up top. Senate Republicans will be prepared to do whatever is necessary to finish this job through the reconciliation process.  The obstacles facing this administration remain immense, as do the steps needed to bring this health care vote to completion. The incompetent manner in which President Trump has handled legislation and the congressional process could easily result in disastrous stumbles in the week ahead. But this is a big moment for President Trump and Republicans who now have a taste of just how much damage they can inflict on the strength of government if they are able to get their act together between now and the midterms of 2018.",

Consider recent events in South Korea and Brazil, two countries where the first women ever elected president also became the first ever to be impeached and removed from office. In fact, think also about the United States, and how Donald Trump, a candidate with a grimy ethical track record, was able to paint his rival, the first woman to lead a major party ticket, as the corrupt one. Friday, South Korea\u2019s Constitutional Court formally removed President Park Geun-hye from her post, saying she had \u201cbetrayed the trust of the people.\u201d Her presidency, the court said, \u201ccannot be tolerated for the sake of protecting the constitution.\u201d To be sure, the toppling of now-former President Park is a step forward. Corruption is like gangrene that poisons democracy, business and society. But it\u2019s remarkable how the country\u2019s legislators found their moral outrage at precisely this moment, when the country was led by a woman for the first time in its history. The legislature indicted Park last December over accusations that she had been overly influenced by her (female) adviser, Choi Soon-sil, who heads a religious group and stands accused of soliciting bribes from large companies. Already, the heir to the mighty Samsung empire has been arrested in connection to the case. Protester and police clash in South Korea The scandal has rocked the country to its core, and it could have serious geopolitical ramifications. Park was a hard-liner on North Korea, and the opposition, which favors a different approach, may gain power when new elections are held within 60 days. The country is now on heightened military readiness in case North Korea makes a move during the crisis. Again, it is a positive development when any country tries to uproot corruption, but the cozy ties between business and government in South Korea are nothing new. In fact, there is no sign that corruption became worse during Park\u2019s presidency. The country\u2019s Corruption Perception Index score was essentially unchanged during her tenure. Elsewhere among the world\u2019s 20 largest economies, the G20, the only other whose president was removed from office in recent months was Brazil, where Dilma Rousseff was deposed also on corruption charges, which she denied until the very end. Rousseff was accused of altering the budget figures to make the deficit seem smaller in order to improve her 2014 re-election chances. She was re-elected by a narrow margin, but her popularity collapsed amid an economic crisis and a growing, though unrelated, corruption scandal. Smelling blood, the opposition decided it could not countenance her ethical shortcomings and impeached her. Rousseff insisted she did nothing illegal. How South Korea's politics could get even more confusing Since she was booted out, Brazil has been roiled in a massive graft investigation, with dozens of lawmakers and other prominent figures prosecuted in connection with billions of dollars in kickbacks between businesses and politicians. So far she has not been directly implicated. South Korea and Brazil have each launched impeachment proceedings in the past against male presidents. Brazil\u2019s Fernando Collor de Mello resigned before the impeachment trial could remove him from office. South Korea\u2019s Ro Moo-Hyun\u2019s impeachment was overturned by the court and he was restored to power.  But it was each country\u2019s only female president who was removed from power through the impeachment process.  And it is significant that while 17 of 20 heads of state of the G20 were male in the past year, 100 percent of those removed from power after impeachment were female. Ethical standards among politicians also became a top issue in the US presidential election. It was quite appropriate that the Democratic candidate, Hillary Clinton, was closely scrutinized for her private email server, for possible connections between donations to the Clinton Foundation and her work as secretary of state, and for her decision to give highly-paid speeches to Wall Street. But what is extraordinary is the extent to which the moralistic fire fell on her while the mountain of accusations against Donald Trump didn\u2019t seem to make a dent. Trump was facing multiple scandals, from his \u201cTrump University\u201d scam to the statement that he grabbed women against their will and a flurry of foreseeable conflicts of interest, which are turning into reality in this presidency. Dilma Rousseff: 'I'm the victim of a great injustice' Recall the feverish chants of \u201cLock her up!\u201d led by Michael Flynn, who resigned as Trump\u2019s national security adviser after just one month on the job following revelations that he lied about meetings with the Russian ambassador. Now Flynn, who was so indignant over \u201cCrooked Hillary\u2019s\u201d supposed pay-to-play misdeeds, has just revealed that at the time he was leading the chants, he received $530,000 as a \u201cforeign agent\u201d in exchange for actions that \u201ccould be construed to have principally benefited the Republic of Turkey.\u201d As for Trump and Flynn, it\u2019s hard to decide what is a more serious failing: knowing or not knowing what a top foreign policy adviser was doing. The impression that there is a double standard at work is hard to miss. Scholars, it turns out, have studied it. In one experiment, they showed volunteers evidence of Medicare fraud by fictitious administrators, asking what the punishment should be. When the fraudster\u2019s name was \u201cJane,\u201d they recommended higher penalties than when the same violation was committed by \u201cJack.\u201d Another study looked at actual ethical violations investigated by the American Bar Association. It found the ABA disbarred women more than twice as often as men for identical infractions. Some researchers theorized the reason is that we stereotype women as having higher ethical standards, and then we penalize them for breaking the stereotype.  Or maybe society is just uncomfortable with women in positions of power. Discrimination, it turns out, comes in many forms \u2013 some blatant, some subtle. But perhaps the most sophisticated expression of prejudice is the one that comes couched in high-sounding proclamations of moral righteousness. No, society should not lower the ethical standards for women. Rooting out corruption is more important than most people realize. The solution is to apply ethical rules implacably, to get rid of the double standard by making men abide by the same standards applied to women and to punish men just as harshly as we do women when they commit the same crimes. Then we won\u2019t have to wait until women are elected to get rid of corruption.
